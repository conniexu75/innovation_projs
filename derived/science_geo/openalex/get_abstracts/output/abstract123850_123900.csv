https://openalex.org/W2050621406,"We previously reported the cloning of a cDNA encoding human phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D1 (PLD1), an ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-activated phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (Hammond, S. M., Tsung, S., Autschuller, Y., Rudge, S. A., Rose, K., Engebrecht, J., Morris, A. J., and Frohman, M. A. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 29640-29643). We have now identified an evolutionarily conserved shorter splice variant of PLD1 lacking 38 amino acids (residues 585-624) that arises from regulated splicing of an alternate exon. Both forms of PLD1 (PLD1a and 1b) have been expressed in Sf9 cells using baculovirus vectors and purified to homogeneity by detergent extraction and immunoaffinity chromatography. PLD1a and 1b have very similar properties. PLD1a and 1b activity is Mg2+dependent but insensitive to changes in free Ca2+ concentration. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate activate PLD1a and 1b but a range of other acidic phospholipids are ineffective. PLD1a and 1b are highly responsive to activation by GTP-γS-liganded ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF-1) and can also be activated to a lesser extent by three purified RHO family monomeric GTP-binding proteins, RHO A, RAC-1, and CDC42. Activation of PLD1a and 1b by the RHO family monomeric GTP-binding proteins is GTP-dependent and synergistic with ARF-1. Purified protein kinase C-α activates PLD1a and 1b in a manner that is stimulated by phorbol esters and does not require ATP. Activation of PLD1a and 1b by protein kinase C-α is synergistic with ARF and with the RHO family monomeric GTP-binding proteins, suggesting that these three classes of regulators interact with different sites on the enzyme.

The common reaction catalyzed by these enzymes is hydrolysis of PC to form phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline. PA has a number of biological activities including direct regulation of a range of cell-specific target proteins in vitro (3Bocckino S.B. Wilson P.B. Exton J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Other PA-derived molecules with regulatory properties include lyso-PA and arachidonic acid metabolites, both of which act on specific cell-surface receptors (6Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

PLD activities are present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms including many mammalian tissues and cell lines. cDNA sequences of several bacterial and plant PLDs have been determined (8Wang X.

Mutation or deletion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SPO14 gene produces defects in meiosis, and the spo14 gene product has recently been identified as a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2)-dependent PC-specific PLD (10Rose K.

We used sequence shared between this protein and the plant enzymes to clone a human cDNA encoding a PC-specific PLD which we termed PLD1. Heterologous expression of this cDNA generated a PI(4,5)P2-dependent PLD activity that was stimulated by GTPγS-activated ARF-1 (13Hammond S.M. Autschuller Y.M. Tsung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K.

The plant, yeast, and human PLDs share four regions of homology. Two of these are present in bacterial PLDs from Streptomyces species and presumably contain regions essential for catalysis. Apart from these regions, the sequences of the proteins diverge widely. Although the PLD enzymes catalyze the same reactions, these differences in primary structure suggest that they are regulated in different ways and have different functions (2Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 945-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 201: 177-204Google Scholar). Regulation of PLD activities in mammalian systems is complex. In intact cells, a range of agonists acting through G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases stimulate PLD-catalyzed hydrolysis of PC. In many systems, receptor-mediated activation of PLD appears to be dependent on a prior activation of inositol lipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC) and mediated by a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent process (14Pai J.K.

In vitro studies suggest that PKC regulates PLD by two different mechanisms. Addition of a purified PKC preparation to membranes from rat liver produced a modest PLD activation that was independent of ATP; in addition, a partially purified PLD preparation from porcine brain was strongly activated by PKC-α (and its isolated lipid-binding regulatory domain) in an ATP-independent manner (17Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PKC-α and, to a lesser extent, PKC-μ also activate an HL-60 membrane PLD activity in an ATP-independent manner (19Ohguchi K. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4366-4372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, similar studies using human neutrophil membranes and a number of purified PKC isoforms indicate that PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of a membrane component is required for PLD activation (20Lopez I. Burns D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19465-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Other work has identified roles for monomeric GTP-binding proteins in PLD regulation. Brain extracts appear to contain two PLD activities that can be separated by column chromatography and further distinguished by their differential dependences on PI(4,5)P2 and fatty acids for activity (21Okamura S. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31207-31213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Massenburg D. Han J.S. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2-dependent PLD activities in brain and HL-60 monocytic cells are stimulated by members of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family of monomeric GTP-binding proteins and several RHO family monomeric GTP-binding proteins including RHO A, RAC-1, and CDC42 (23Brown H.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14944-14950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The ARF proteins are key regulators of protein trafficking that control the assembly of the coatomer complex on the surface of Golgi membranes (29Boman A.L. Kahn R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 147-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). ARF-activated PLD is enriched in Golgi membranes, and PLD may play a role in ARF-dependent coatomer assembly (30Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4952-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The RHO proteins control both changes in organization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of protein kinase cascades leading to gene transcription (31Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The role of PLD in these processes is untested. Studies using bacterial toxins implicate the RHO proteins in receptor regulation of PLD in some systems (32Kuribara H. Tago K. Yokozeki T. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Morii N. Narumiya S. Katada T. Kanaho Y.

Increases in PLD activity have also been reported in cells transformed by members of the ras oncogene family and by the src nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (34Carnero A. Cuadrado A. del Peso L. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1387-1395PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jiang H. Lu Z. Luo J.-Q. Wolfman A. Foster D.A. J. Biol.

The complex regulation of PLD activities reported in intact cells and the variety of lipid and protein factors capable of PLD activation in vitro has led to the proposal that distinct mammalian PLDs exist (21Okamura S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14944-14950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Purification of a 180-kDa oleate-activated PLD from porcine lung has been described (21Okamura S. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31207-31213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but no mammalian monomeric GTP-binding protein-regulated PLD has been purified to homogeneity. During studies of the regulation of PLD1 mRNA levels in HL-60 cells, we identified a second form of PLD1 that arises by alternate splicing of a 38-amino acid exon. We designate the “long” and “short” forms of PLD1 as PLD1a and 1b, respectively. The present study was undertaken to investigate the catalytic and regulatory properties of PLD1a and 1b. Both proteins have been expressed in insect cells using baculovirus vectors and purified to homogeneity. Our results demonstrate that PLD1a and 1b can be activated by PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(4,5)P2, ARF-1, RHO A, RAC-1, CDC42, and protein kinase C-α. The simplest explanation of our findings is that this diverse range of regulators exert their effects by direct interaction with the PLD1 catalyst. Unless otherwise stated, reagents were from previously noted sources (13Hammond S.M. Autschuller Y.M. Tsung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Unlabeled phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. PI(4,5)P2 was purified from a lipid extract of bovine brain as described (13Hammond S.M. Autschuller Y.M. Tsung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Di-C16 PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was synthesized as described (36Gu Q. Prestwich G.D. J. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 8642-8647Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from HL-60 cells by the acid guanidine thiocyanate method and reverse transcribed using random hexamer mixed primers. Primers used for amplification of hPLD1 were synthesized as follows: primer A (forward), nucleotides 1475-1491 TGGGCTCACCATGAGAA; primer B (reverse), nucleotides 2133-2113 GTCATGCCAGGGCATCCGGGG. Amplification conditions used were 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min at 25-27 cycles. The rat PLD1 sequences were obtained by PCR amplification from a reverse-transcribed rat brain RNA template. The mouse PLD1 sequences were obtained from cDNA clones isolated from a mouse embryo cDNA library. 2W. C. Colley and M. A. Frohman, unpublished observations. The genomic sequence of PLD1 was obtained from an expressed sequence tag corresponding to a partially processed mRNA (accession number R97756). Some of our experiments also employed human ARF-1 that was bacterially expressed and purified as described (37Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with a final step of hydroxylapatite chromatography (Bio-Rad, Bio-Gel HTP). Human RHO A, RAC-1, and CDC42 were modified to contain the sequence MEEEEYMPME at the amino terminus. Human ARF-1 was modified to contain this sequence at the carboxyl terminus, and these proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells using baculovirus vectors and purified by affinity chromatography using an immobilized monoclonal antibody (38Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Settleman J. Curnette J.T. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All preparations of monomeric GTP-binding proteins were estimated to be greater than 90% pure by SDS-PAGE. The purified monomeric GTP-binding proteins were concentrated to 1-10 mg/ml using an Amicon pressure concentrator with a PM-10 membrane and stored in aliquots at −80°C. In some cases, the monomeric GTP-binding proteins were preactivated by treatment with 5 mM EDTA on ice for 15 min followed by incubation with 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM GTPγS at 37°C for 15 min. Human PKC-α was expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus vector provided by David Burns (Parke-Davis) and purified using minor modifications from published procedures (39Kitano T. Go M. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 124: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In brief, a 1-liter culture of Sf9 cells (106 cells/ml) was grown in supplemented Grace's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotic/antimycotic agents and infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of 10. The cells were cultured for 48 h, harvested, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and disrupted by nitrogen cavitation in buffer containing 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine (Buffer A). PKC-α was purified from the supernatant obtained after ultracentrifugation of this extract by sequential chromatography on Source 15 Q (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), threonine-Sepharose 4BCL (prepared as described in Ref. 38Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Settleman J. Curnette J.T. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and phenyl-Superose (Pharmacia). PKC-α was followed during this procedure by measurements of calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase activity using histone as substrate. The final PKC-α preparation was homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The purified PKC-α was concentrated to approximately 0.1 mg/ml using an Amicon pressure concentrator with a PM30 membrane and stored in aliquots at −80°C. Peptides corresponding to residues 1-15 and 525-541 of the sequence of human PLD1 were prepared, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, suspended in saline, and emulsified with Freund's adjuvant. Two rabbits were immunized with the peptide corresponding to residues 1-15, and two different rabbits were immunized with the peptide corresponding to residues 525-541 by subcutaneous injection. After a second immunization, serum was obtained from the animals, and antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the individual peptide antigens as the solid phase. Antibodies were affinity purified from serum obtained from the animals with the highest antibody titers by affinity chromatography using immobilized peptide antigens as the solid phase as described (40Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 511-552Google Scholar). The purified antibodies were adjusted to approximately 1 mg/ml and stored as aliquots in buffer containing 10 mM NaPO42−, 20 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM NaN3 at −80°C. These antibodies recognize PLD1a and 1b by Western blotting and can immunoprecipitate their antigens under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions. The peptide antigens were chosen to generate antibodies that can distinguish PLD1 from a structurally related mammalian PLD enzyme, PLD2. 3W. C. Colley, T.-C. Sung, R. Roll, J. Jenco, S. M. Hammond, Y. Altschuller, D. Bar-Sagi, A. J. Morris, and M. A. Frohman, submitted for publication. 1 mg of a mixture of the two affinity purified antibodies was adsorbed to 0.5 ml of protein A coupled to Sepharose CL4B (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was washed with 0.2 M Na+ borate, pH 9.0, and the antibodies were covalently linked to the immobilized protein A by reaction with 20 mM dimethylpimelimidate in 0.2 M Na+ borate, pH 9.0, for 30 min at room temperature with constant agitation. The reaction was quenched by washing the resin in 0.2 M ethanolamine, pH 8, after which the resin was washed in 100 mM glycine, pH 3.0, to remove antibodies that had not been covalently attached. The resin was then washed extensively and stored in PBS containing 0.1% NaN3. Recombinant baculoviruses for expression of PLD1a and 1b were generated, selected, purified, and propagated using methods described in Ref. 41O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Lucklow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 107-166Google Scholar. In brief the PLD1a and 1b cDNAs were inserted into the multiple cloning sites of the pAcHLT and PVL1392 transfer vectors, respectively (Pharmingen and Invitrogen Inc.). Monolayers of Sf9 cells were transfected with mixtures of the PLD1a and 1b transfer vectors and linearized wild-type baculovirus DNA. Recombinant baculoviruses were plaque-purified from media removed from these transfected cells. The pure viruses were amplified by infection of suspension cultures of Sf9 cells, and the high titer virus stocks were stored at 4°C. All of our studies used Sf9 cells grown at 27°C in complete Grace's medium supplemented with lactalbumin, yeastolate, and 10% fetal bovine serum containing antibiotic antimycotic agents. For expression of PLD1a and 1b, monolayers of exponentially growing Sf9 cells (3 × 107 cells/225-cm2 flask, generally two flasks of cells were used for each purification) were infected with recombinant baculoviruses viruses at a multiplicity of 10 for 1 h with gentle rocking. The virus-containing medium was removed and replaced with fresh supplemented Grace's medium. The infected cells were grown for 48 h; the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed on ice by addition of 5 ml/225-cm2 flask of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After 30 min on ice, the cells were scraped up, and the suspension was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant obtained (10 ml) was mixed with 0.5 ml of the immunoaffinity resin and kept at 4°C with constant agitation for 1 h. The resin was sedimented by gentle centrifugation, and the supernatant containing unbound proteins was removed. The resin was washed three times with 25 volumes of lysis buffer. After the final wash, the resin was resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer and placed in a 10-ml Bio-Rad disposable chromatography column. The resin was washed with 10 ml of 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1%μ-D-octylglucoside (μ-DOG). Bound protein was eluted with 100 mM glycine, pH 3.0, containing 1%μ-DOG as 3 × 0.5-ml fractions. The eluant was collected on ice into tubes containing 0.075 ml of 1 M phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. ARF-stimulated PLD activity in these fractions was determined as described below, and the fractions were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels and Western blotting with detection by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. We prepared two batches of immunoaffinity resin and found that these could be re-used many times with little deterioration in performance. The basic PLD assay was performed as described previously using headgroup-labeled PC (13Hammond S.M. Autschuller Y.M. Tsung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the [Ca2+] (using Ca2+/EGTA buffers) and [Mg2+] of the assay medium were varied. For some assays the lipid component of the vesicles was altered as indicated. Purified monomeric GTP-binding proteins and protein kinase C-α were included in some of the experiments. In certain experiments, the monomeric GTP-binding proteins were pre-activated with GTPγS as described above. In other cases 50 μM GTPγS was included in the assays. Reagents were mixed on ice and reactions initiated by transfer to a 37°C water bath. We designed PCR primer sets to amplify a central fragment of the coding region of PLD1 and attempted to use these to investigate the regulation of PLD1 mRNA in HL-60 cells using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. In addition to a PCR product of the expected size, we also amplified a smaller fragment. Both fragments were cloned and sequenced, and the results indicated that the larger product corresponded to the PLD1 sequence reported (13Hammond S.M. Autschuller Y.M. Tsung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K.

Synthesis of appropriately chosen junction primers permitted amplification of each product independently (data not shown). These results could arise from regulated splicing of an optional 38-amino acid exon or from partial processing of an intron which would imply that our original report described a partially processed mRNA (13Hammond S.M. Autschuller Y.M. Tsung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Examination of the PLD1 genomic sequence at codon corresponding to amino acid 623 (the 3′ junction of the missing sequence) revealed that an acceptable splice donor site (and 11 nucleotide T/C-rich sequence followed by any nucleotide and AG) is present and that the adjacent genomic sequence does not encode the nucleotide sequence found in either of the PCR products detected (Fig. 1B). We therefore conclude that the originally reported sequence of PLD1 includes an alternately spliced exon. Subsequent analysis of cDNAs obtained by screening a HeLa cell cDNA library with a PLD1 nucleotide probe (13Hammond S.M. Autschuller Y.M. Tsung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) revealed that two clones obtained encoded the “long” form of PLD1 and three the short form (hereafter designated PLD1a and PLD1b, respectively). PCR analysis of reverse-transcribed rat brain mRNA using these primer sets also led to the amplification of fragments corresponding to PLD1a and 1b. Partial length cDNA clones corresponding to PLD1a and PLD1b have also been isolated from a mouse embryo cDNA library using human PLD1-derived probes (Fig. 1C). The position of this alternately spliced region of PLD1 and its relationship to sequences conserved among other PLD enzymes is shown in Fig. 1D We have expressed and purified PLD1a and PLD1b using baculovirus vectors and investigated their regulation by divalent cations, phospholipids, monomeric GTP-binding proteins, and PKC-α. Baculovirus-mediated expression of both forms of PLD1 is considerably better when monolayers (as opposed to suspension cultures) of insect cells are used. In both cases, large quantities of insoluble proteins accumulate. The active fraction of these recombinantly expressed enzy"

However, the physiologically relevant pathways mediating oxidative damage have not yet been identified. Three potential mechanisms are tyrosyl radical, hydroxyl radical, and redox active metal ions. Tyrosyl radical forms o,o′-dityrosine cross-links in proteins. The highly reactive hydroxyl radical oxidizes phenylalanine residues to o-tyrosine and m-tyrosine. Metal ions oxidize low density lipoprotein (LDL) by poorly understood pathways. To explore the involvement of tyrosyl radical, hydroxyl radical, and metal ions in atherosclerosis, we developed a highly sensitive and quantitative method for measuring levels of o,o′-dityrosine, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in proteins, lipoproteins, and tissue, using stable isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We showed that o,o′-dityrosine was selectively produced in LDL oxidized with tyrosyl radical. Both o-tyrosine and o,o′-dityrosine were major products when LDL was oxidized with hydroxyl radical. Only o-tyrosine was formed in LDL oxidized with copper. Similar profiles of oxidation products were observed in bovine serum albumin oxidized with the three different systems. Applying these findings to LDL isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions, we detected a 100-fold increase in o,o′-dityrosine levels compared to those in circulating LDL. In striking contrast, levels of o-tyrosine and m-tyrosine were not elevated in LDL isolated from atherosclerotic tissue. Analysis of fatty streaks revealed a similar pattern of oxidation products; compared with normal aortic tissue, there was a selective increase in o,o′-dityrosine with no change in o-tyrosine. The detection of a selective increase of o,o′-dityrosine in LDL isolated from vascular lesions is consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative damage in human atherosclerosis is mediated in part by tyrosyl radical.

Metal-catalyzed oxidation systems represent another potential pathway for LDL oxidation. In these systems, redox active metals bound to proteins interact with hydrogen peroxide and a reducing agent to generate a hydroxyl radical-like intermediate (9Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). However, it is uncertain whether the metal ions required for these pathways are present in vivo because the body has intricate mechanisms for chelating metals and rendering them redox inactive (14Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). We have described a mechanism for LDL oxidation that does not require free metal ions (15Savenkova M.I. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20394-20400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidation reaction involves tyrosyl radical generated by myeloperoxidase (16Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke III, H.L. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a hemeprotein secreted by activated phagocytes (17Klebanoff S.J. Ann. Intern.

Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin.

Palinski W. Yla-Herttuala S. Butler S. Witztum J.L. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 336-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Moreover, oxidation products of the enzyme (21Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been detected by immunohistochemistry in vascular lesions (22Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that myeloperoxidase promotes LDL oxidation in vivo One strategy for determining whether free metal ions, metal-catalyzed oxidation systems, or tyrosyl radical oxidize proteins in vivo is to analyze normal and atherosclerotic vascular tissue for stable end products of these three pathways identified through in vitro studies. Hydroxyl radical generated by metal-catalyzed oxidation systems converts protein-bound phenylalanine residues to the unnatural isomers o-tyrosine and m-tyrosine (Fig. 1; Refs. 14Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar and 23Huggins T.G. Wells-Knecht M.C. Detorie N.A. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol.

It has not been established whether LDL oxidation by free metal ions generates a similar pattern of oxidation products. With protein oxidation by tyrosyl radical, o,o′-dityrosine is a major product (Fig. 1; Refs. 26Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar and 27Francis G.A. Mendez A.J. Bierman E.L. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6631-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These amino acid products are stable to acid hydrolysis, making them potentially useful markers for protein oxidation in vivo (23Huggins T.G. Wells-Knecht M.C. Detorie N.A. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin.

It combines gas chromatography with stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Using this assay, we first investigated the relative yields of the three markers in LDL oxidized in vitro with free copper, hydroxyl radical, and tyrosyl radical. o-Tyrosine was a major oxidation product when either free copper or a hydroxyl radical system was used to oxidize LDL. In contrast, o,o′-dityrosine was selectively produced when tyrosyl radical was the oxidizing agent. A similar pattern of products was observed in bovine serum albumin (BSA) oxidized with the different systems. We then used the method to demonstrate that levels of o,o′-dityrosine, but not o-tyrosine or m-tyrosine, were elevated in LDL isolated from human atherosclerotic tissue. Collectively, these observations suggest that tyrosyl radical plays a role in oxidizing LDL in the artery wall. Unless otherwise indicated, reagents were obtained from either Sigma or Aldrich Chemical Co. All organic solvents were high performance liquid chromatography grade. Cambridge Isotope Laboratories supplied 13C-labeled amino acids. All buffers were passed over a Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) column to remove transition metal ions. Isotopically labeled o-tyrosine and m-tyrosine were synthesized using [13C6]phenylalanine, copper, and H2O2 (23Huggins T.G. Wells-Knecht M.C. Detorie N.A. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol.

Compounds were analyzed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using an Ultrasphere ODS column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm diameter particles; Beckman) equilibrated with solvent A (5% methanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.5) and eluted with solvent B (90% methanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.5). The elution gradient was: 0-35% solvent B over 10 min; isocratic elution at 35% solvent B for 4 min; 35-100% solvent B over 12 min; isocratic elution at 100% solvent B for 5 min. LDL was isolated rapidly using a two-step density gradient from plasma (EDTA, 1 mg/ml) prepared from normolipidemic, healthy subjects (30Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 233: 469-489Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). LDL was collected by needle aspiration and subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Bio-Rad 10 DG column equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). All reactions were carried out at 37°C in reaction mixture containing 1 mg of protein/ml of either BSA (fatty acid-free; Boehringer Mannheim) or LDL. Hydroxyl radical was generated by addition of 2 mM H2O2 to Buffer A supplemented with 0.1 mM CuSO4 (23Huggins T.G. Wells-Knecht M.C. Detorie N.A. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol.

Reactions were terminated by the addition of 300 nM catalase, 100 μM butylated hydroxytoluene, and 200 μM DTPA, and proteins were immediately precipitated at 4°C with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10%, v/v). The protein pellet was washed with 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and delipidated with 4 ml of methanol/water-washed diethyl ether (1:3, v/v). The protein residue was hydrolyzed as described below. Vascular tissue resected at surgery or autopsy was immediately placed in ice-cold antioxidant buffer (100 μM DTPA, 1 mM butylated hydroxytoluene, 1% (v/v) ethanol, 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), and then frozen at −80°C until analysis. LDL was isolated from vascular lesions using a modified method of Steinbrecher and Lougheed (31Steinbrecher U.D. Lougheed M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 608-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated thoracic aortae were thawed in Buffer B (0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.3 mM EDTA, 100 μM DTPA, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μM butylated hydroxytoluene, and 10 mM 3-aminotriazole). Fatty streaks and intermediate lesions were resected from aortic tissue (∼9 g wet weight per aorta), frozen in liquid N2, and pulverized under liquid N2 with a stainless steel mortar and pestle. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4°C. Tissue powder was collected into 50-ml sterile conical tubes, Buffer B was added (5 ml/g tissue), and the tubes were rocked gently end-over-end overnight. Tissue powder was pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet and uppermost lipemic layer were discarded. LDL in the supernatant was isolated by sequential density ultracentrifugation (d = 1.02-1.07 g/ml; Ref. 32Heinecke J.W. Rosen H. Suzuki L.A. Chait A. J. Biol.

LDL was extensively dialyzed against Buffer C (50 mM phosphate, 0.1 mM DTPA, pH 7.4) and then against Buffer D (0.1 mM DTPA, pH 7.4) under N2 prior to analysis. Vascular tissue was thawed at room temperature. Regions of normal and atherosclerotic aortic tissue were defined morphologically using the criteria of the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth Study (33Heinecke J.W. Li W. Mueller D.M. Bohrer A. Turk J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resected arterial tissue was frozen in liquid N2 and pulverized using a stainless steel mortar and pestle. Tissue powder (∼60 mg wet weight) was suspended in 1 ml of Buffer D, dialyzed (2 h) versus Buffer D at 4°C, and then delipidated by incubation (10 min) with 13 ml of methanol/water-washed diethyl ether (3:10, v/v) on ice. The sample was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was removed, and the fluffy protein powder was again delipidated with 10 ml of water-washed diethyl ether. The protein or tissue residue was dried under N2, 13C-labeled internal standards were added, and the sample was then hydrolyzed at 110°C for 24 h in 0.5 ml of 6 N HCl (Sequenal grade, Pierce Chemical) supplemented with 1% benzoic acid and 1% phenol. The samples were supplemented with 10% trichloroacetic acid (v/v) and passed over a reverse phase column (3 ml, LC-18 SPE Tube, Supelco Inc. Bellefonte, PA), which was previously washed with 12 ml of 50 mM NaHPO4 and 100 μM DTPA (pH 7.4) followed by 12 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Amino acids were eluted with 25% methanol (2 ml) and dried under vacuum for derivatization. Preliminary studies using authentic standards demonstrated that the amino acids were stable to acid hydrolysis and that >80% of tyrosine oxidation products were recovered from the C-18 column using this procedure. Amino acids were converted to carboxylic acid esters by the addition of 200 μl of HCl/n-propyl alcohol (1:3, v/v) and heating for 1 h at 65°C. Excess reagent was evaporated under N2. To prepare the heptafluorobutyryl derivatives of the amino acids, 50 μl of heptafluorobutyric anhydride/ethyl acetate (1:3, v/v) was added, and the samples were heated at 65°C for 10 min. To prepare the pentafluoropropionyl derivatives of the amino acids, 50 μl of pentafluoropropionic anhydride/ethyl acetate (1:4, v/v) was added, and the samples were heated at 65°C for 30 min. Amino acids were quantified by stable isotope dilution GC-MS. Derivatized samples were dried under N2 and redissolved in 50 μl of ethyl acetate, and 1 μl aliquots were then analyzed on a Hewlett Packard 5890 Gas Chromatograph equipped with a 12-m DB-1 capillary column (0.20 mm inside diameter, 0.33-μ film thickness, J & W Scientific) interfaced with a Hewlett Packard 5988A Mass Spectrometer with extended mass range (26Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 34Heinecke J.W. Li W. Mueller D.M. Bohrer A. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10127-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The injector and ion source temperature were set at 250°C and 150°C, respectively. Full scan mass spectra and selected ion monitoring were obtained with both the n-propyl heptafluorobutyryl and the n-propyl pentafluoropropionyl derivatives of both authentic and isotopically labeled amino acids in the negative-ion chemical ionization mode with methane as the reagent gas. For phenylalanine and p-tyrosine, an aliquot of derivatized amino acid was diluted 1:100 (v/v) with ethyl acetate. A 1-μl sample was injected into the gas chromatograph with a 1:100 split prior to mass analysis. The initial column temperature of 120°C was maintained for 1 min and then increased to 220°C at 10°C/min. The mass spectrum of the n-propyl heptafluorobutyryl derivative of phenylalanine included a small molecular ion (M−) at mass-to-charge (m/z) 403 and a prominent ion at m/z 383 (M−− HF). Phenylalanine was quantified using the m/z 383 ion. The mass spectrum of the n-propyl heptafluorobutyryl derivative of p-tyrosine revealed prominent ions at m/z 595 (M−− HF) and 417 (M−− CF3 (CF2)2CHO). The m/z 417 ion was used to quantify tyrosine. Tyrosine and phenylalanine oxidation products were analyzed without dilution and injected in the splitless mode. The initial column temperature was 150°C: it was increased to 300°C at 40°C/min. The mass spectrum of the n-propyl heptafluorobutyryl derivative of o,o′-dityrosine included a small molecular ion at m/z 1228 (M−) and prominent ions at m/z 1208 (M−− HF) and 1030 (M−− CF3 (CF2)2CHO). The m/z 1208 ion was used to quantify o,o′-dityrosine levels. The mass spectrum of the n-propyl heptafluorobutyryl derivative of o-tyrosine exhibited prominent ions at m/z 595 (M−− HF) and 417 (M−− CF3 (CF2)2CHO). The m/z 595 ion was used for quantification. The mass spectrum of the n-propyl heptafluorobutyryl derivative of m-tyrosine exhibited prominent ions at m/z 595 (M−− HF) and 417 (M−− CF3 (CF2)2CHO). The m/z 417 ion was used for quantification. The generation of oxidized amino acids by the analytical procedure was investigated in preliminary experiments. The increase in the level of o-tyrosine in phenylalanine subjected to acid hydrolysis was less than 10 μmol of oxidation product/mol of precursor amino acid, which is less than 5% of the value found in tissue. Under these conditions, there was no detectable conversion of tyrosine to o,o′-dityrosine. The level of oxidation products in model proteins (BSA, RNase, IgG) subjected to acid hydrolysis, derivatization, and GC-MS analysis was variable. For o-tyrosine it ranged from 100 to 1,100 μmol/mol, and for o,o′-dityrosine it ranged from undetectable (less than 5 μmol/mol) to 60 μmol/mol. The level of oxidation products in different model proteins remained consistent during repeated analyses, strongly suggesting that the oxidized amino acids were present endogenously. These observations indicate that the analytical procedure itself was not a source of protein oxidation. To determine whether post-mortem changes were likely to be contributing to protein oxidation, human aortic tissue obtained at either surgery or autopsy was subjected to acid hydrolysis, derivatization, and negative-ion chemical ionization GC-MS analysis. There were no significant differences in the levels of o-tyrosine and o,o′-dityrosine in the surgical and autopsy tissue, suggesting that post-mortem changes are unlikely to result in significant alterations in the levels of o-tyrosine, m-tyrosine, and o,o′-dityrosine in human vascular tissue. The base peak ion of each amino acid was used for quantification. To ensure that interfering ions were not co-eluting with the analyte, the ratio of ion currents of the two most abundant ions of each amino acid were monitored in all analyses. Under these chromatographic conditions, authentic compounds and isotopically labeled standards were baseline separated and exhibited retention times identical to those of analytes derived from tissue samples. Quantification was based on an external calibration curve using each amino acid as a standard and the corresponding isotopically labeled amino acid as internal standard. The ratio of ion currents for each amino acid divided by that of the internal standard was a linear function of unlabeled amino acid for all ranges over which the amino acids were measured. The limit of detection (signal/noise > 10) was ≤1 pmol for all of the amino acids. The coefficients of variation for the analyses of tyrosine and phenylalanine in different LDL preparations were 0.8% and 4.8%, respectively. To investigate the relative yields of the amino acid markers after protein oxidation by hydroxyl radical, metal ions, and tyrosyl radical, BSA and LDL were exposed to either a copper-H2O2 oxidation system (hydroxyl radical), free copper (metal ion), or a myeloperoxidase-H2O2-tyrosine system (tyrosyl radical). We selected BSA for our initial studies because albumin is abundant in plasma and has been widely investigated as a target for oxidative damage in vitro To determine whether lipid components might affect the pattern of oxidation products, we performed similar experiments with LDL. LDL was rapidly isolated using a procedure that generates very low levels of endogenous lipid hydroperoxides (30Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 233: 469-489Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The presence of o-tyrosine, m-tyrosine, and o,o′-dityrosine was determined using stable isotope dilution GC-MS analysis. Hydroxyl radical was generated using a system containing 0.1 mM copper and 2 mM H2O2. The accumulation of o-tyrosine in BSA oxidized by hydroxyl radical was initially linear and then reached a plateau after 2 h (data not shown). o-Tyrosine was the major product when BSA was oxidized by hydroxyl radical, and smaller amounts of m-tyrosine and o,o′-dityrosine were also formed (Fig. 2A). When LDL was oxidized by hydroxyl radical under the same experimental conditions, the major products were o-tyrosine and o,o′-dityrosine, with smaller amounts of m-tyrosine (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that o-tyrosine is a major product of protein oxidation by hydroxyl radical. Copper is a potent catalyst for LDL oxidation in vitro (11Heinecke J.W. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1890-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 13Steinbrecher U.P. Parthasarathy S. Leake D.S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3883-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar), but the yield of aromatic oxidation products in the modified lipoprotein has not been reported. We therefore monitored the formation of o-tyrosine, m-tyrosine, and o,o′-dityrosine in LDL exposed to copper. To explore the effect of the lipid environment of LDL on its susceptibility to oxidation, we also determined the product yield of the oxidation products in BSA. The levels of o-tyrosine, m-tyrosine, and o,o′-dityrosine were unaffected by exposing BSA to high concentrations of copper alone (Fig. 3A). The oxidation of tyrosine and phenylalanine residues in BSA by the hydroxyl radical generating system thus requires both H2O2 and copper under these experimental conditions (compare Figs. 2A and 3A). In contrast to BSA, both o-tyrosine and m-tyrosine increased in LDL exposed to copper (Fig. 3B). However, there was little change in the level of o,o′-dityrosine in LDL incubated with copper alone (Fig. 3B). When LDL was exposed to copper, the kinetics of protein oxidation (monitored as o-tyrosine formation) and lipid oxidation (monitored as thiobarbituric acid reacting substances; Ref. 32Heinecke J.W.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I integral membrane protein and is the precursor of the amyloid peptide, the main component of the senile plaques (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J.

Sisodia S.S. Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1995; 2: 188-190Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain and the acidic loop domain, located between transmembrane domains six and seven, are hydrophilic and can be alternatively spliced (9Rogaev E.I. Sherrington R. Rogaeva E.A. Levesque G. Ikeda M. Liang Y. Chi H. Lin C. Holamn K. Tsuda T. Mar L. Sorbi S. Nacmias B. Piacenti S. Amaducci L. Chumakov I. Cohen D. Lannfelt L. Fraser P.E. Rommens J.M. St. George-Hyslop P.H.

The mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease are found all over the protein, but the hydrophilic loop constitutes a “hot spot” with nine different mutations described to date (5Haass C. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Van Broeckhoven C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The biological function of the presenilins remains essentially unknown, but, interestingly, the 103 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of PS2 can inhibit apoptosis in a “deathtrap” assay (18Pasquale V. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Based on the homology with Caenorhabditis elegans proteins, roles in intracellular protein sorting and/or intercellular signal transmission have been proposed as well (19L'Hernault S.W. Arduengo P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Leviatan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar).A hypothetical final common pathway in the pathogenesis of the genetic and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease has been postulated, based on the invariable occurrence of the amyloid deposits, the neurofibrillar tangles and the neurodegeneration in all affected brains. The central question is thus how mutations in the presenilin genes can cause this typical neuropathology. Studies indicating an increased production of more amyloidogenic βA4-(1-42) peptide in fibroblasts obtained from patients with presenilin mutations would support the amyloid hypothesis that postulates abnormal βA4 amyloid peptide production and plaque formation as the pivotal event in the pathogenesis of the disease (2Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 21Scheuner D. Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird T.D. Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Larson E. Levy-Lahad E. Viitanen M. Peskind E. Poorkaj P. Schellenberg G. Tanzi R. Wasco W. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D. Younkin S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). However, the observed increases in βA4-(1-42) peptide production were relatively small, and the suggested relationship between presenilin mutations and APP metabolism should be further corroborated by experiments showing directly the effect of presenilin mutations on APP processing in transfected cells or in brains of transgenic animals. Moreover, other aspects of APP metabolism such as the production of carboxyl-terminal APP fragments (16De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) should be investigated in greater detail. The possibility that presenilins interact with the cytoskeleton or exert their effect via apoptotic pathways should not be disregarded at this time (18Pasquale V. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In addition to addressing these questions, basic information is needed on the subcellular localization, the posttranslational modifications, and the membrane orientation of the presenilins.We used COS-1 cells and CHO cells to express PS1 and PS2, as well as Myc-tagged PS1 and PS1-containing mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease. The biosynthesis of transfected and untransfected presenilins was studied using immunoblotting or metabolical labeling and immunoprecipitation assays. We demonstrate that transfected presenilins are phosphorylated on serine residues. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we document the association of presenilin 1 with the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway and demonstrate the cytoplasmic orientation of the two major hydrophilic domains.DISCUSSIONThe current investigation provides a detailed characterization of the biosynthesis of presenilins overexpressed in COS-1 cells and CHO cells. The results show that the PS proteins are unglycosylated phosphoproteins with apparent molecular masses of about 45 and 50 kDa in SDS-PAGE. They have a strong tendency to form SDS-resistant complexes with apparent molecular masses between 100 and 250 kDa. Double immunofluorescence studies showed that PS1 is mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus and that its amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop domain are oriented to the cytoplasmic side.The localization of transfected PS1 in the endoplasmic reticulum of COS-1 cells or CHO cells is not a simple consequence of overexpression of the protein or nonspecific general effects on the biosynthetic pathway in these cells. First, endogeneous presenilins are located in the endoplasmic reticulum of untransfected cells as demonstrated in Fig. 1A using confocal laser microscopy. Second, using identical transfection conditions, APP and furin were found to accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, as demonstrated before (33Slunt H.H. Thakaran G. Von Koch C. Lo A.C.Y. Tanzi R.E.

Craessaerts, unpublished results. in CHO cells stably expressing human APP770 was not affected by transfection of PS1, ruling out general inhibitory effects on protein transport and processing. On the other hand, the levels of endogeneous presenilin in COS-1 cells are apparently very low. Only the combination of immunoprecipitation to concentrate PS1 from detergent extracts of 10 × 106 cells, followed by immunoblotting using mAb PS1-3, allowed us to detect endogeneous PS1 migrating at the same molecular weight as transfected PS1. The disadvantage of this approach is that the antibodies from the immunoprecipitation step interfere with the consecutive detection of possible PS-aggregates in the immunoblotting step (Fig. 3C). This assay also precludes a dynamic analysis of the metabolism of the presenilins using metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments. On the other hand, it allowed us to demonstrate the presence or absence of particular antibody epitopes on PS1 fragments. Importantly, the use of hydrophilic loop-specific antibodies in the immunoprecipitation step resulted in the detection of relative large amounts of, presumably proteolytic, fragments of PS1 in the 18-30-kDa range (Fig. 3C). The level of these fragments was not, or only slightly, increased in COS-1 cells that overexpressed PS1, which explains why they were not readily detected in the transfection experiments. The proteolytic process involved is probably easily saturated or even inhibited by PS overexpression (35Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our data therefore do not allow us to speculate any further on the exact nature or the biological significance of this process. We can only conclude that overexpression studies of the type used here are not suitable to study this particular aspect of presenilin metabolism. On the other hand, it is clear that untransfected cells (Fig. 3) and brain tissue in vivo (36Mercken M. Takahashi H. Honda T. Sato K. Muryama M. Nakazato Y. Noguchi K. Imahori K. Takashima A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 37Elder G.A. Tezapsidis N. Carter J. Shioi J. Bouras C. Li H.C. Johnston J.M. Efthimiopoulos S. Friedrich V.L. Robakis N.K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) contain detectable amounts of intact presenilin. Since this endogeneously expressed PS1 has the same mobility as transfected PS1, the conclusion that transfected PS1 (and PS2) are not subject to glycosylation, sulfation, glycosaminoglycan modification, palmitoylation, or myristoylation also holds apparently true for the endogeneous protein. These posttranslational modifications are thereby also excluded as contributing to the formation of the high molecular mass, SDS-resistant aggregates (100-250 kDa) in SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. These aggregates were observed to a variable extent in all our experiments, and were noticed by others using other cell types or brain tissue (36Mercken M. Takahashi H. Honda T. Sato K. Muryama M. Nakazato Y. Noguchi K. Imahori K. Takashima A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 38Kovacs D.M. Fausett H. Page K.J. Kim T.W. Moir R.D. Merriam D.E.

Bonici B. Gohin M. Imperato A. Revah F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since the smears were detected with three different antibodies recognizing three different epitopes, and by a Myc-directed mAb using a Myc-tagged PS1 construct, the aggregates must contain presenilin core proteins, alone or associated with unidentified components. Denaturation of immunoprecipitates at 37°C instead of 95°C, resulted in less aggregates and increased amounts of the 45-kDa PS1 band (Fig. 3C). The aggregates therefore probably consist mainly of oligomers of presenilins. It is unclear whether this property to form SDS-resistant aggregates in vitro has any physiological significance in vivo, but immuno-electron microscope observations suggest that clustering of presenilins also occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum of untransfected cells.2 It should be envisaged that in pathological conditions exacerbated aggregation of presenilins could become a problem. In this context, it should be mentioned that antibodies against PS1 stain amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (40Wisniewski T. Palha J.A. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Lancet. 1995; 346: 1366Abstract PubMed Google Scholar).Importantly, the two point mutations causing Alzheimer's disease that were studied here, i.e. PS1 Ala-246 → Glu (FAD1 kindred) and PS1 Cys-410 → Tyr (NIH2 kindred), did not alter the biosynthesis or level of expression of the PS1 protein in COS-1 cells and CHO cells. These mutations must cause therefore more subtle effects. The possibility that they interfere with the fragmentation of PS1, as was shown recently for two other mutations (35Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), cannot be excluded from the current data. Analysis of brains of transgenic mice expressing the PS1 Ala-246 → Glu mutant indicate, however, that at least this mutation does not interfere with the proteolytic processing of PS1. 4D. Moechars, B. De Strooper, and F. Van Leuven, unpublished results. Since all PS mutations known to date act in a dominant way in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, a gain of function is most likely. Evidence that fibroblasts derived from patients with presenilin mutations produce more and longer forms of the βA4 amyloid peptide suggests that the mutations exert their effect on cellular metabolism or trafficking of amyloid precursor protein (21Scheuner D. Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird T.D. Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Larson E. Levy-Lahad E. Viitanen M. Peskind E. Poorkaj P. Schellenberg G. Tanzi R. Wasco W. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D. Younkin S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). The localization of PS1 in the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway makes it unlikely that the presenilin mutations directly influence α- and/or β-secretase activity, since these operate in the late-Golgi and transport vesicles, at the cell surface and in endosomes (27De Strooper B. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Van Den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 41Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol.

The possibility that PS mutants influence the balance between amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing of APP in an indirect way by changing its intracellular trafficking should now be further explored in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and neurons (16De Strooper B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4058-4065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Our study demonstrates furthermore that the presenilins are phosphorylated on serine residues. Phosphorylation of PS1 and PS2 was evident both in COS-1 cells and CHO cells, but the phosphorylation of PS1 was less intense and more variable than of PS2. The observation that okadaic acid enhanced the PS1 phosphorylation suggests that PS1 is more prone to phosphatase activity than PS2 (Fig. 8A). Protein kinase C is not responsible for PS phosphorylation, since neither stimulation of cells by phorbol esters nor purified kinase added to immunoprecipitated PS1 or PS2 resulted in increased labeling. It is therefore unlikely that the presenilins are directly involved in the regulation of APP secretion by protein kinase C (46Buxbaum J.D. Gandy S.E. Cichetti P. Ehrlich M.E. Czernik A.J. Fracasso R.P. Ramabhadran T.V. Unterbeck A.J. Greenhard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6003-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 47Gillespie S.L. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Finally, we showed that the hydrophilic NH2-terminal and the major loop domain of PS1 are exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Digitonin at low concentrations selectively permeabilizes the cell membrane, but not the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (29Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies directed toward the amino-terminal domain of PS1 (Fig. 9) displayed similar immunofluorescent staining patterns in digitonin and saponin permeabilized cells. Control experiments with antibodies against a luminal epitope, i.e. the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (30Napier R.M. Venis M.A. Bolton M.A. Richardson L.I. Butcher G.W. Planta. 1988; 176: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar), showed that digitonin did not permeabilize the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. For the major hydrophilic loop domain, essentially identical results were obtained. The conclusion therefore is that the two major hydrophilic domains in PS1 are oriented to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum, which directs the search for candidate proteins interacting with these domains toward the cytoplasm. Consistent with this conclusion, antibodies against the second loop domain reacted with PS1 after saponin, but not after digitonin permeabilization. This not only confirms the luminal localization of the recognized epitope, but also validates the approach as it was used.While more detailed studies, including electron microscopy and enzymatic digestion protection assays, are required to settle definitively the orientation of the presenilins in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, our results clarify already two important issues. The first problem is the orientation of the first transmembrane domain in PS1, which determines in fact the topology of all the following transmembrane domains (46Buxbaum J.D. Gandy S.E. Cichetti P. Ehrlich M.E. Czernik A.J. Fracasso R.P. Ramabhadran T.V. Unterbeck A.J. Greenhard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6003-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The positive charge difference between the 15 carboxyl-terminal and the 15 amino-terminal residues flanking the first membrane spanning domain suggests a luminal orientation of its amino terminus (48Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-579049Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). However, several exceptions to this rule are known, mainly of proteins of which the amino-terminal domain contains more then 17 charged amino acid residues (48Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-579049Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In PS1, this domain contains 29 charged residues, which would explain its cytoplasmic orientation. The second issue, which has been pointed out by others before (9Rogaev E.I. Sherrington R. Rogaeva E.A. Levesque G. Ikeda M. Liang Y. Chi H. Lin C. Holamn K. Tsuda T. Mar L. Sorbi S. Nacmias B.

Sisodia S.S. Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1995; 2: 188-190Google Scholar), is whether two putative hydrophobic stretches in the PS amino acid sequence flanking the hydrophilic loop, can additionally span the membrane, which would make the presenilins nine transmembrane domain proteins. Our data are compatible with a seven-transmembrane domain model with the amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 10; see also Note Added in Proof). In conclusion, the current study has analyzed the biosynthesis and the subcellular localization of the presenilins and provides a basis for the further study of their cell biology and their possible interactions with integral membrane and cytoplasmic proteins such as APP or Tau, both implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (4Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Note Added in ProofAn eight-transmembrane model, with hydrophobic region VIII in the loop domain spanning the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, is also compatible with these data. This would result in a cytoplasmic orientation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of PS1. INTRODUCTIONAlzheimer's disease is a major health problem. Patients suffer from a progressive dementia caused by massive neuronal loss in cortical and hippocampal areas of the brain (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J.

Neuropathological signs of the disease are tangles and amyloid deposits in the brain parenchyma, and amyloid deposits in the brain vasculature. The cause of the sporadic form of the disease is still unknown, although an increased risk is associated with the presence of apolipoprotein allele E4 (6Strittmatter W.J. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

On the other hand, familial early onset Alzheimer's disease is caused by point mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (8Goate A. Chartier-Harlin M.C. Mullan M. Brown J.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I integral membrane protein and is the precursor of the amyloid peptide, the main component of the senile plaques (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 2Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 3Checler F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1431-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Point mutations in exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene cause alterations in the metabolism of APP. This results in an increased production of intracellular βA4 amyloid peptide containing carboxyl-terminal APP fragments and in an increased secretion of the potentially neurotoxic βA4 peptide (1Haass C.

Based on computer algorithms, seven membrane spanning domains have been defined (9Rogaev E.I. Sherrington R. Rogaeva E.A. Levesque G. Ikeda M. Liang Y. Chi H. Lin C. Holamn K. Tsuda T. Mar L.

Sisodia S.S. Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1995; 2: 188-190Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain and the acidic loop domain, located between transmembrane domains six and seven, are hydrophilic and can be alternatively spliced (9Rogaev E.I. Sherrington R. Rogaeva E.A. Levesque G. Ikeda M. Liang Y. Chi H. Lin C. Holamn K. Tsuda T. Mar L. Sorbi S. Nacmias B. Piacenti S. Amaducci L. Chumakov I. Cohen D. Lannfelt L. Fraser P.E. Rommens J.M. St. George-Hyslop P.H.

The mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease are found all over the protein, but the hydrophilic loop constitutes a “hot spot” with nine different mutations described to date (5Haass C. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Van Broeckhoven C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The biological function of the presenilins remains essentially unknown, but, interestingly, the 103 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of PS2 can inhibit apoptosis in a “deathtrap” assay (18Pasquale V. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Based on the homology with Caenorhabditis elegans proteins, roles in intracellular protein sorting and/or intercellular signal transmission have been proposed as well (19L'Hernault S.W. Arduengo P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Leviatan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar).A hypothetical final common pathway in the pathogenesis of the genetic and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease has been postulated, based on the invariable occurrence of the amyloid deposits, the neurofibrillar tangles and the neurodegeneration in all affected brains. The central question is thus how mutations in the presenilin genes can cause this typical neuropathology. Studies indicating an increased production of more amyloidogenic βA4-(1-42) peptide in fibroblasts obtained from patients with presenilin mutations would support the amyloid hypothesis that postulates abnormal βA4 amyloid peptide production and plaque formation as the pivotal event in the pathogenesis of the disease (2Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 21Scheuner D. Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird T.D. Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Larson E. Levy-Lahad E. Viitanen M. Peskind E. Poorkaj P. Schellenberg G. Tanzi R. Wasco W. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D. Younkin S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). However, the observed increases in βA4-(1-42) peptide production were relatively small, and the suggested relationship between presenilin mutations and APP metabolism should be further corroborated by experiments showing directly the effect of presenilin mutations on APP processing in transfected cells or in brains of transgenic animals. Moreover, other aspects of APP metabolism such as the production of carboxyl-terminal APP fragments (16De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) should be investigated in greater detail. The possibility that presenilins interact with the cytoskeleton or exert their effect via apoptotic pathways should not be disregarded at this time (18Pasquale V. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In addition to addressing these questions, basic information is needed on the subcellular localization, the posttranslational modifications, and the membrane orientation of the presenilins.We used COS-1 cells and CHO cells to express PS1 and PS2, as well as Myc-tagged PS1 and PS1-containing mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease. The biosynthesis of transfected and untransfected presenilins was studied using immunoblotting or metabolical labeling and immunoprecipitation assays. We demonstrate that transfected presenilins are phosphorylated on serine residues. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we document the association of presenilin 1 with the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway and demonstrate the cytoplasmic orientation of the two major hydrophilic domains."

We now report the isolation of a membrane domain from neuronal plasma membranes that has the biochemical characteristics of caveolae. A low density membrane (LDM) fraction with the same density as caveolae was highly enriched in tyrosine kinases such as insulin receptors, neurotrophin receptors, Eph family receptors, and Fyn. Grb2, Ras, heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, and Erk2 were also concentrated in the LDM. Incubation of the LDM fraction at 37°C stimulated the phosphorylation on tyrosine of multiple, resident proteins, whereas the bulk membrane fraction was devoid of tyrosine kinase activity. The LDM, which makes up ∼5-10% of the plasma membrane protein, appears to be organized for signal transduction.

Rat peritoneal macrophages were cultured in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and expression of the inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and liver-type arginase (arginase I) was analyzed. mRNAs for iNOS and arginase I were induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. iNOS mRNA appeared 2 h after LPS treatment and increased to a near maximum at 8-12 h.

NO is synthesized from arginine by nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), generating citrulline. Cellular NO production is absolutely dependent on the availability of arginine. This amino acid can be obtained from exogenous sources via the blood circulation, from intracellular protein degradation, or by the endogenous synthesis of arginine. Major sites of arginine synthesis in ureotelic animals are the liver, where arginine generated in the urea cycle (ornithine cycle) is rapidly converted to urea and ornithine by arginase, and the kidney, where arginine is synthesized from citrulline and released into the blood circulation (see Ref. 4Morris S.M.

Cederbaum S.D. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We isolated cDNA for arginase II and showed that it is 59% identical with arginase I on the amino acid level (29Gotoh T. Sonoki T. Nagasaki A. Terada K. Takiguchi M. Mori M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We also found that the enzyme is mitochondrial and that its mRNA is induced by LPS, dexamethasone, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate and is reduced by interferon-γ (29Gotoh T. Sonoki T. Nagasaki A. Terada K. Takiguchi M. Mori M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of arginase isoforms in NO synthesis, we examined expression of the isoforms and iNOS in cultured rat peritoneal cells and in LPS-treated rats using RNA blots, immunoblots, and immunocytochemical analyses. We report here that iNOS and arginase I mRNAs and proteins are coinduced by LPS in cultured rat peritoneal macrophages and in the lung and spleen in vivo The induction of mRNA for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), a transactivator of the arginase I gene, is also described.DISCUSSIONNO synthesis is regulated by depending on the availability of arginine, substrate of the NOS reaction, as well as by NOS activity and other factors. Arginine can be obtained via the blood circulation or by endogenous synthesis from citrulline. Arginine transport into cultured macrophages increases in response to LPS and to interferon-γ (35Bogle R.G. Baydoun A.R. Pearson J.D. Moncada S. Mann G.E. Biochem.

Furthermore, argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase, which together synthesize arginine from citrulline, are induced in stimulated murine macrophages (8Nussler A.K. Billiar T.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9405-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and intracellular arginine synthesis is enhanced.Activity of arginase that degrades arginine is also induced in activated macrophages (38Kung J.T.

Nature. 1978; 273: 758-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Arginase induced in activated RAW 264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage-like cell line, was shown to be arginase II (28Wang W.W. Jenkinson C.P. Griscavage J.M. Kern R.M. Arabolos N.S. Byrns R.E. Cederbaum S.D. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the present work, we noted that arginase I, not arginase II, is induced by LPS in primary cultured rat peritoneal macrophages and in the lung and spleen in vivo This was unexpected because arginase I has been thought to be expressed almost exclusively in the liver. Differential induction of the two arginase isoforms in the mouse macrophage-like cell line and in primary cultured rat macrophages may be due to differences in animal species or to differences between the established cell line and the primary cultured cells. Arginase I mRNA was induced more slowly than iNOS mRNA. The induced arginase I probably decreases arginine availability for the NOS reaction in activated macrophages and may down-regulate the overproduction of NO. All of these results suggest that there is a complex regulation of genes encoding enzymes and transporter proteins involved in arginine metabolism that together control NO production in cells.Arginase I mRNA was induced slowly in cultured peritoneal macrophages and also in vivo with an apparent lag time of a few hours. Therefore, the induction of arginase I appears to be mediated by a transcription factor(s) that is synthesized de novo in response to LPS stimulation. C/EBP family members bind to the promoter and enhancer regions of the arginase I gene and activate the promoter (Refs. 22Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9186-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J.

J. 1995; 312: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar for a review), C/EBPβ being the most potent. The present study also shows that C/EBPβ mRNA is induced in the LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. The induction of C/EBPβ mRNA is more rapid than that of arginase I mRNA. Thus, the induction of arginase I appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the induction of C/EBPβ.

To better understand the role of arginase isoforms in NO synthesis, we examined expression of the isoforms and iNOS in cultured rat peritoneal cells and in LPS-treated rats using RNA blots, immunoblots, and immunocytochemical analyses. We report here that iNOS and arginase I mRNAs and proteins are coinduced by LPS in cultured rat peritoneal macrophages and in the lung and spleen in vivo The induction of mRNA for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), a transactivator of the arginase I gene, is also described."

To define the function of this phosphorylation, PKCα species with mutations of this site were investigated. The alanine mutant, S657A PKCα, displayed slow phosphate accumulation in pulse-chase experiments, indicating a rate-limiting role in the initial phase of phosphorylation. Consistent with this, the aspartic acid mutant, S657D PKCα, showed an increased rate of phosphate accumulation. Both the S657D and S657A PKCα mutants were slow to accumulate as fully phosphorylated forms during a second phase of phosphorylation. This latter property is shown to correlate with an increased phosphatase sensitivity and decreased protein kinase activity for these two PKCα mutants. It is further shown that once fully phosphorylated, the S657D PKCα mutant displays WT PKCα properties with respect to thermal stability and phosphatase sensitivity in vitro and in vivo; in contrast, the S657A PKCα mutant remains sensitive. The properties of the Ser-657 site PKCα mutants define functional roles for this phosphorylation in both the accumulation of phosphate on PKCα as well as in its agonist-induced dephosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2000983378,"The human XPF-ERCC1 protein complex is one of several factors known to be required for general nucleotide excision repair. Genetic data indicate that both proteins of this complex are necessary for the repair of interstrand cross-links, perhaps via recombination. To determine whether XPF-ERCC1 completes a set of six proteins that are sufficient to carry out excision repair, the human XPF and ERCC1 cDNAs were coexpressed in Sf21 insect cells from a baculovirus vector. The purified complex contained the anticipated 5′ junction-specific endonuclease activity that is stimulated through a direct interaction between XPF and replication protein A (RPA). The recombinant complex also complemented extracts of XP-F cells and Chinese hamster ovary mutants assigned to complementation groups 1, 4, and 11. Furthermore, reconstitution of the human excision nuclease was observed with a mixture of five repair factors (XPA, XPC, XPG, TFIIH, and RPA) and the recombinant XPF-ERCC1, thus verifying that no additional protein factors are needed for the specific dual incisions characteristic of human excision repair.

Nucleotide excision repair in humans consists of dual incisions on both sides of the lesion in the damaged strand, which results in excision of 24-32-nucleotide-long oligomers followed by repair synthesis and ligation (1Huang J.C.

These reconstitutions have helped define the minimum essential set of proteins for the dual incision/excision activity. It was found that all proteins encoded by the XP genes with the exception of the XPE gene product were required for excision. Other proteins necessary for this reaction pathway are replication protein A (RPA, consisting of three subunits), transcription factor TFIIH (composed of 5-8 subunits including XPB and XPD), and ERCC1 (which together with XPF forms a distinct complex). These studies were conducted with proteins purified mostly from human cells; therefore, a requirement for additional proteins that were present in the reconstitution fractions as “contaminants” was a realistic possibility. The need for additional unknown proteins was argued using evidence that a factor (IF7) of one or more proteins that purified through several columns with XPF-ERCC1 and finally separated from this complex by a DEAE resin was essential for incision specificity by the reconstituted human excision nuclease (8Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hübscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). However, a later report with proteins purified to apparent homogeneity failed to confirm the need for an additional factor (7Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To clarify the discrepancy raised by these studies, we attempted to use proteins expressed and purified from heterologous systems because the presence of trace amounts of IF7 cannot be excluded with the most extensively purified human cellular preparations of XPF-ERCC1.

Toward this goal, we expressed the XPF-ERCC1 complex in abundance using a baculovirus vector, purified the complex to homogeneity, and verified its activity as a junction-specific endonuclease (12Matsunaga T.

Recombinant XPF-ERCC1, referred to hereafter as r(XPF-ERCC1), also complemented extracts of XP-F cells and hamster mutants in complementation groups 1, 4, and 11. The complex is fully capable of reconstituting human excision nuclease when combined with TFIIH, XPC, and recombinant XPA, RPA, and XPG proteins. Our data show that only these six factors are needed for damage-specific dual incision by human excision nuclease. The NcoI-BamHI fragment of the XPF cDNA encoding the N-terminal 260 amino acids of XPF was expressed from pET26b (Novagen) in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (10Brookman K.W. Lamerdin J.E. Thelen M.P. Hwang M. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Zhou Z.Q. Walter C.A. Parris C.N. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6553-6562Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This polypeptide antigen was used to produce mouse polyclonal antibodies. From one of the positive mice, a monoclonal cell line (6D12) was identified and subcloned by standard procedures at the University of California Berkeley Hybridoma Facility. For the overexpression of the recombinant XPF-ERCC1 complex in insect cells, both cDNAs were inserted into the p2Bac vector (Invitrogen). First, the SacI-HindIII fragment of the pMal-ERCC1 construct (13Park C.H. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5110-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) containing the ERCC1 open reading frame (ORF) was placed behind the PH promoter of p2Bac, resulting in the plasmid p2Bac-E1. The ApaI-XbaI fragment of pcER4-34 containing the human XPF ORF (10Brookman K.W. Lamerdin J.E. Thelen M.P. Hwang M. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Zhou Z.Q. Walter C.A. Parris C.N. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6553-6562Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was then inserted into p2Bac-E1, placing XPF under the control of the P10 promoter and creating the final expression construct p2Bac-FE1. Recombinant baculovirus was obtained by standard methods (14O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. A Laboratory Manual: Baculovirus Expression Vectors.Oxford University Press. 1994; Google Scholar) using the BaculoGold transfection kit (PharMingen). For in vitro transcription-translation, the ERCC1 and XPF ORFs were inserted into the pIBI24 vector (IBI). In order to create the appropriate restriction sites for subcloning of XPF, 974 bp encoding the N-terminal one-third of the ORF was amplified from the 5′-end of pcER4-34 using the following polymerase chain reaction primers: 5′-CGCGAATTCAAGGATATAGCTCTAGAGATGGAGTCAGGCAGCCGGCTCGACGGATT and 5′-AAACAGCCAACCTGAATTCTGACCAAACGCTTTTTCCGTT. The XbaI-BamHI fragment of this polymerase chain reaction product and the BamHI-ApaI fragment excised from pcER4-34 carrying the 3′ section of the XPF ORF were cloned into pIBI24, placing XPF under the control of the T7 promoter and creating pTB-F. The ERCC1 cDNA was similarly placed behind the T7 promoter by inserting the SalI-XbaI fragment of pMal-ERCC1 into pIBI24, creating pTB-E1. Sf21 cells (5 × 108) were infected with the baculovirus expression construct p2Bac-FE1 at a multiplicity of infection of 20, and cells were harvested 48 h after infection. Cell-free extract was prepared as described previously (15Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and loaded onto a 20-ml SP-Sepharose column, and the column was developed with a 200-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.0 M KCl in Buffer A (25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 12 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 15% glycerol). The r(XPF-ERCC1) complex that eluted at about 0.4 M KCl was located with polyclonal anti-XPF antibodies (10Brookman K.W. Lamerdin J.E. Thelen M.P. Hwang M. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Zhou Z.Q.

Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5017-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Fractions containing r(XPF-ERCC1) were combined, dialyzed against Buffer A + 100 mM KCl, and then loaded onto a 5-ml glutathione S-transferase-XPA affinity column (17Park C.H. Bessho T. Matsunaga T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22657-22660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The affinity column was washed with 200 ml of Buffer B (25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). r(XPF-ERCC1) complex was eluted with 1.0 M KCl in Buffer B as indicated by both silver staining and immunoblotting of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Fractions containing r(XPF-ERCC1) were collected and dialyzed against Buffer A plus 100 mM KCl. The yield was typically 150 μg of protein of high purity from 20 mg of total CFE. A 3′-end-labeled 90-bp duplex and a 90-bp DNA fragment with a 30-nucleotide unpaired sequence (“bubble”) in the middle as described previously (12Matsunaga T. Park C.-H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) were used as substrates to test for nonspecific nuclease and junction-specific nuclease activities of r(XPF-ERCC1), respectively. The reaction mixture (7.5 μl) contained 5 fmol of DNA and the indicated amount of r(XPF-ERCC1) in nuclease buffer (25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6.5% (v/v) glycerol). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and the products were analyzed on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Reaction mixtures contained 50 μg of mutant CFE, 20 ng of r(XPF-ERCC1), and 25 fmol of the 140-bp cholesterol A substrate (7Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) in 25 μl of excision buffer (6Mu D. Park C.-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out at 30°C for 60 min. For cross-complementation, 25 μg of each mutant CFE was mixed in 25 μl of excision buffer with substrate, and the reaction was carried out in an identical manner. Excised fragments were analyzed on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The mutant CFEs used in this study were XP-A (GM02345B), XP-F (GM08437), ERCC-1 (UV20), ERCC-3 (UV24), ERCC-4 (UV41), ERCC-5 (UV135), and ERCC-11 (UVS1). [35S]Methionine-labeled XPF and ERCC1 proteins were prepared by the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) using pTB-F and pTB-E1 as templates, either added separately or together in the reaction mixture following the manufacturer's instructions. 10 fmol of ERCC1, 4 fmol of XPF, and 4 fmol of XPF-ERCC1 were used for protein-protein interaction study. A 90-bp duplex was terminally labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (12Matsunaga T. Park C.-H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To obtain UV-damaged DNA, the 90-bp duplex was irradiated with 2500 J/m2 of 254 nm light from a germicidal lamp at a fluence rate of 250 milliwatts/cm2. For binding assays, 3 fmol of DNA was incubated with r(XPF-ERCC1) in Buffer A containing 100 mM KCl for 10 min on ice. The reaction mixtures were directly analyzed on 5% native polyacrylamide gels run in 1 × TBE buffer for 90 min at room temperature. The E. coli UvrA protein that binds specifically to UV-irradiated DNA (18Seeberg E. Steinum A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 988-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. Binding was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To obtain a highly purified sample of XPF-ERCC1, we constructed a baculovirus expression vector (p2Bac-FE1) containing the cDNAs from both ERCC1 and the recently cloned XPF (from pcER4-34; Ref. 10Brookman K.W. Lamerdin J.E. Thelen M.P. Hwang M. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Zhou Z.Q. Walter C.A. Parris C.N. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6553-6562Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Infection of Sf21 insect cells resulted in overexpression of both proteins, which purified as a complex through SP-Sepharose followed by XPA-affinity columns (16Park C.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5017-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Park C.H. Bessho T. Matsunaga T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22657-22660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The use of the XPA-affinity step enabled us to isolate 150 μg of r(XPF-ERCC1) from 20 mg of cellular protein with greater than 95% homogeneity. This compares favorably with the yield of <1.0 μg of protein purified from 22 g of HeLa CFE (from a 250-liter cell culture; Ref. 17Park C.H. Bessho T. Matsunaga T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22657-22660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). After separating the proteins by SDS-gel electrophoresis, analysis by silver staining verified that the preparation was free of protein contaminants (Fig. 1). Antibodies to each of the two subunits detected proteins from the purified preparation that migrated exactly as the 38-kDa (ERCC1) and 112-kDa (XPF) proteins extracted from HeLa cells. This agreement indicates that neither one of the overexpressed proteins undergoes post-translational modification in Sf21 cells, and that the insect cells are capable of carrying out the same post-translational modification as human cells. Two related enzymatic activities have been attributed to XPF-ERCC1 that help to explain its function in excision repair. The complex incises the 5′ junction of DNA bubble and loop structures four nucleotides 5′ to the junction (12Matsunaga T. Park C.-H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and makes the 5′ incision of the dual incision human excision nuclease (7Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20862-20869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Purified r(XPF-ERCC1) was tested for these properties. When a DNA bubble substrate was used, r(XPF-ERCC1) made the specific cleavage expected, and this activity was stimulated 40-50-fold by the addition of RPA (Fig. 2A). The complex did not nick double-stranded DNA (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). Incision activity was severely inhibited by the anti-XPF monoclonal antibody, demonstrating the dependence of the reaction on the XPF protein (Fig. 2B). We also tested r(XPF-ERCC1) for complementation of excision nuclease (20Reardon J.T. Thompson L.H. Sancar A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), an activity that we consider to be the most specific for the native complex (17Park C.H. Bessho T. Matsunaga T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22657-22660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). r(XPF-ERCC1) was found to complement extracts from XP-F cells and the Chinese hamster ovary mutants of complementation groups 4 (ERCC4/XPF) and 1 (ERCC1), but not extracts from XP-A cells and groups 3 (ERCC3/XPB) and 5 (ERCC5/XPG) (Fig. 3). The recombinant protein also complemented the Chinese hamster ovary complementation group 11 mutant (21Hata H. Numata M. Tohda H. Yasui A. Oikawa A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 195-198PubMed Google Scholar), which is now known to be a member of group 4 (10Brookman K.W. Lamerdin J.E. Thelen M.P. Hwang M. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Zhou Z.Q. Walter C.A.

As we have observed previously, XPF-ERCC1 complex binds tightly to XPA, e.g. during its purification on the XPA-affinity column. Moreover, XPF-ERCC1 appears to interact with the RPA protein, since the junction endonuclease activity is greatly stimulated by RPA (12Matsunaga T. Park C.-H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To study the contribution of the two members of the complex in these binding interactions, the proteins were expressed either singly or in combination in an in vitro transcription-translation system and tested for binding to XPA or RPA (Fig. 4). In agreement with earlier reports (16Park C.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5017-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22Li L. Elledge S.J. Peterson C.A. Bales E.S.

XPF by itself weakly adsorbed to the XPA-affinity resin (lane 2), suggesting that the association of the complex with XPA is mediated mostly by ERCC1. In contrast, ERCC1 did not bind to RPA (lane 5), as XPF did (lane 6), and therefore XPF must mediate the binding of the complex to RPA (lane 7). These results demonstrate that the binding observed previously (in which XPF-ERCC1 bound to RPA with particularly high affinity in the presence of the DNA bubble substrate (12Matsunaga T. Park C.-H.

We tested for binding of r(XPF-ERCC1) to UV-damaged DNA to find out if it contributed to damage recognition. However, unlike the UvrA subunit of E. coli excision nuclease that discriminates between damaged and undamaged DNA, r(XPF-ERCC1) bound nearly as well to both substrates (Fig. 5). Thus, we conclude that even though XPF-ERCC1 has an intrinsic affinity to DNA, it does not contribute to locating lesions and in this respect is comparable to the homologous Rad1-Rad10 protein complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (28Sung P. Reynolds P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26391-26399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although significant progress has been made recently in identifying and assigning functions to all of the proteins involved in human excision repair (6Mu D. Park C.-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S.

Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hübscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) reported that, in addition to these six proteins, an incision factor (IF7) was required. In the latter report, this factor appeared to be tightly bound to XPF-ERCC1 and was separated from it at the last step of a 7-column purification scheme. Therefore, the possibility remained that the nominally pure XPF-ERCC1 complex used in other studies might contain IF7, which would explain the discrepancy between the two reports. Hence, we reasoned that r(XPF-ERCC1) purified from a heterologous source would be useful for solving this problem. We combined r(XPF-ERCC1) with the other known factors: XPA, RPA, and XPG, overexpressed and purified from E. coli or insect cells, and XPC and TFIIH, purified to near-homogeneity from HeLa cells (7Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This set of highly purified proteins was able to carry out precise excision of an adducted oligonucleotide, thus giving firm evidence that XPF-ERCC1 protein is both necessary and sufficient to reconstitute human excision nuclease when added to the other five excision repair factors (Fig. 6). Indeed, studies with the highly homologous S. cerevisiae system have arrived at the same conclusion; that is, the yeast homologs of the six factors are necessary and sufficient for specific incision/excision of UV-damaged DNA (29Guzder S.N.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8903-8910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Human excision nuclease has been reconstituted from purified repair factors and characterized in considerable detail (2Sancar A. Annu. Rev.

However, the repair factors are of low cellular abundance, precluding detailed mechanistic studies with proteins purified from natural sources. Of the six repair factors, XPA, RPA, XPG, and XPC are currently available in recombinant forms that can be purified in abundant quantities. As reported here, the availability of the XPF cDNA (10Brookman K.W. Lamerdin J.E. Thelen M.P. Hwang M. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Zhou Z.Q. Walter C.A. Parris C.N. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6553-6562Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) has enabled us to demonstrate direct interaction of XPF with RPA, a finding that may help explain how RPA stimulates the nuclease function of XPF-ERCC1 and how it may target it to its proper site of action in the excision nuclease complex. The use of recombinant protein in the reconstituted system has also confirmed that no additional factors are needed for reconstituting human excision nuclease. When the recombinant form of TFIIH becomes available, it will be possible to perform mechanistic experiments with human excision nuclease such as those that have been conducted with prokaryotic excision nuclease for many years."

This is particularly important for eukaryotic microbes such as Leishmania because they must synthesize considerable amounts of extracellular and cell surface glycoconjugates that play significant roles in the infectious cycle. Here we used properly oriented sealed microsomes to characterize lumenal uptake of GDP-Man in Leishmania donovani In this system, GDP-Man uptake was saturable with an apparent Km for GDP-Man of 0.3 μM and facilitated its use as a donor substrate for lipophosphoglycan (LPG) synthesis.

In the future, the amenability of the Leishmania system to biochemical and genetic manipulation will assist in functional characterization of nucleotide-sugar transports from this and other eukaryotes.

Eukaryotic glycosylation mechanisms often require the translocation of dolichol-linked saccharides and/or transport of nucleotide-sugars synthesized in the cytoplasm into the lumen of the appropriate microsomal organelle. A broad array of nucleotide-sugar transporter (NST) 1The abbreviations used are: NSTnucleotide-sugar transporterLPGlipophosphoglycanESTexpressed sequence tagDIDS4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidTLCKNα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketoneHAhemagglutinin. activities with differing substrate specificities in the Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticulum have been reported (1Hirschberg C.B. Clapham D.E. Ehrlich B.E. Organellar Ion Channels and Transporters. Rockefeller University Press, New York1996: 105-120Google Scholar). Known NST activities include those for UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-glucuronic acid, UDP-xylose, UDP-GalNAc, GDP-fucose, GDP-Man, and CMP-sialic acid (1Hirschberg C.B. Clapham D.E. Ehrlich B.E. Organellar Ion Channels and Transporters. Rockefeller University Press, New York1996: 105-120Google Scholar). Three candidate NST genes have been reported recently: one for the UDP-GlcNAc transporter from Kluyveromyces lactis (2Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and the others for the CMP-sialic acid transporter (3Eckhardt M. Muhlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In different organisms and cell types, NSTs are involved in both housekeeping and specialized cellular functions (1Hirschberg C.B. Clapham D.E. Ehrlich B.E. Organellar Ion Channels and Transporters.

The protozoan parasite Leishmania synthesizes a variety of abundant complex glycoconjugates, whose expression permits the parasite to persevere in hostile environments throughout its life cycle in the sand fly and mammalian phagolysosome (5Turco S.J. Descoteaux A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 65-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). One of these is lipophosphoglycan (LPG), the major cell surface glycoconjugate of the promastigote (insect stage) form of the parasite. In L. donovani, LPG contains four domains: a lipid anchor (1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-phosphatidylinositol), a glycan core with the structure Gal(α1,6)Gal(α1,3)Galf(β1,3)[Glc(α1-PO4)→6]Man(α1,3)Man(α1, 4)GlcN(α1,6), a series disaccharide-phosphate repeating units, and a cap containing one of several small oligosaccharide-phosphates containing β-galactose and α-mannose (5Turco S.J. Descoteaux A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 65-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The repeats are attached to the C-6 hydroxyl of the distal Gal of the glycan core, and each of the 15-30 disaccharide-phosphate units has the structure [Gal(β1,4)Man(α1-PO4)→6] in L. donovani The repeating unit domain is the most prominent feature of LPG, and repeating units also occur on secreted proteins, most prominently an abundant secreted acid phosphatase, a molecule also implicated in parasite virulence (7Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Russell D.G. Hohenberg H. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Ilg T. Overath P. Ferguson M.A.J. Rutherford T. Campbell D.G. McConville M.J.

The [Gal(β1,4)Man(α1-PO4)→6] repeating units are synthesized by the sequential transfer of mannose 1-phosphate and galactose from their respective nucleotide donors (10Carver M.A. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10974-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Carver M.A. Turco S.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cellular compartment in which repeating unit synthesis likely occurs is the Golgi apparatus, as monensin treatment inhibits repeating unit attachment to both LPG and the secreted acid phosphatase (12Bates P.A. Hermes I. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 39: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since no evidence was obtained for the participation of lipid intermediate carriers for the two sugars in this process (10Carver M.A. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10974-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the nucleotide-sugar substrates for these reactions need to be transported from their cytosolic site of synthesis to the site of utilization in the Golgi lumen. Thus, due to the large amounts of LPG and related glycoconjugates synthesized by the parasite, considerable demands are placed upon NST activity during the infectious cycle. One of the attractive features of the LPG system is the ability to identify LPG-deficient mutants (13King D.L. Turco S.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 28: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14McNeely T.B. Tolson D.L. Pearson T.W. Turco S.J.

Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Previously we described the C3PO mutant, which shows a complete lack of repeating units on LPG and the secreted acid phosphatase (17Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Despite its lpg− phenotype, crude microsomal preparations of C3PO were able to conduct LPG synthesis, suggesting that the defect in this mutant lay in the assembly or compartmentalization of LPG biosynthesis, rather than in a specific glycosyltransferase activity. The gene LPG2 was shown to be deleted in C3PO, and the predicted LPG2 protein encoded a hydrophobic membrane protein. From these data, we proposed that LPG2 was involved in the transport of a key LPG biosynthetic precursor or activity into a new cellular compartment, presumably the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. In this paper we describe the development of an in vitro assay to demonstrate intravesicular GDP-Man transport in Leishmania membrane vesicles, and use this system to establish that the Leishmania gene LPG2 is essential for GDP-Man uptake. Sequence data base searches indicate that LPG2 is a member of a large eukaryotic gene family, which is proposed to include members affecting NST activity with different substrates and cellular compartments in distinct species and cell types. Materials were obtained as follows. GDP-[1-14C]Man (50 mCi/mmol), UDP-[6-3H]Gal (10.2 Ci/mmol), GDP-[1-14C]fucose (10 Ci/mmol), and CMP-[3H]sialic acid (20 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and M199 medium were from Life Technologies, Inc.; thin layer chromatography cellulose plates were from Eastman Kodak Corp.; and AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin were from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Promastigotes of L. donovani (1S2D strain) were grown at 25°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (13King D.L. Turco S.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 28: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The LPG-defective, L. donovani mutant C3PO (14McNeely T.B. Tolson D.L. Pearson T.W. Turco S.J. Glycobiology. 1990; 1: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was grown in the above medium supplemented with 10× fetal bovine serum. C3PO transfected with either cLHYG cosmids containing Leishmania genomic DNA bearing LPG2 or the expression vector pX63HYG-LPG2(HA) (17Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) were maintained in M199 medium supplemented with 10× fetal bovine serum and hygromycin B (50 μg/ml). Stationary phase L. donovani were harvested, pelleted at 3,000 × g for 15 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (13King D.L. Turco S.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 28: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and resuspended in the reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM TLCK, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM 2,3-dimercaptopropanol). The cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation at 1,500 p.s.i. for 25 min at 4°C. Microsomal vesicles were isolated according to the procedures of Goud et al. (18Goud B. Salminen A. Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 753-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Vesicle integrity was determined by measuring the latency of galactosyltransferase-catalyzed transfer of [3H]galactose from UDP-[3H]Gal to GlcNAc (19Fleischer B. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The transport assays were started by mixing 100 μl of vesicle protein (1 mg) with 100 μl of reaction buffer (above) containing GDP-[14C]Man (final concentration of 3 μM). After incubation at 28°C for 6 min, the samples were placed on ice and diluted with 1.5 ml of reaction buffer and applied onto a filtration apparatus (Millipore 1225 Sampling Manifold) containing HA filters (24 mm diameter; 0.45 μm pore size). The filters were washed with 25-30 ml of buffer and radioactivity on the filters was measured by scintillation counting. The amount of GDP-[14C]Man that was nonspecifically bound to the outside of the vesicles was determined by measuring the radioactivity associated with the vesicles at zero time of incubation of vesicles with solute. Two methods were used to demonstrate the presence of GDP-[14C]Man within the vesicles following transport. In one method, after a 6-min transport assay, the washed filters were placed into 1 ml of water, sonicated for 15 min at 4°C, and extracted twice with 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (3:2) in the final proportion of chloroform:methanol:water of 3:2:1. The aqueous phases were combined and desalted by gel filtration on a column of Bio-Gel P2. An aliquot of the desalted sample was applied to a thin layer cellulose plate using methanol/formic acid/water (80:15:5) as the solvent system and GDP-mannose as the chemical standard. GDP-Man was detected with silver nitrate and ethanolic NaOH (20Anet E.F.L.J. Reynolds T.M. Nature. 1954; 174: 930-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Radioactive samples were scanned by a Bioscan detector. In a second method, identification of GDP-[14C]Man by chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose was performed based on the protocol described by Rush and Waechter (21Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, another aliquot of the desalted sample was dried under a steam of nitrogen, redissolved in 0.1 ml of water, and applied to a column (4 ml) of concanavalin A-Sepharose equilibrated in 15 mM ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, containing 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM MnCl2. GDP-[14C]Man was eluted with 50 mMα-methylmannoside in the equilibration buffer. In vitro LPG biosynthesis was performed as described by Carver and Turco (10Carver M.A. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10974-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The microsomal vesicles (1 mg of protein) were incubated with 2 μM GDP-[14C]Man (0.4 μCi), 10 μM UDP-galactose in HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM TLCK, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 mM ATP, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) at 28°C for 1 h in a final volume of 250 μl. The reaction was terminated by addition of chloroform/methanol to the incubation mixture to give a final ratio of chloroform/methanol/water (4:8:3) and sonicated. By protocols described elsewhere (10Carver M.A. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10974-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the membranes were sequentially extracted and the radioactive LPG product was purified and quantitated. Immunoelectron microscopy was performed on frozen sections from transfected promastigotes fixed in 1× glutaraldehyde in Hepes saline and infiltrated in polyvinylpyrrolidine/sucrose as described previously (22Russell D.G. Xu S. Chakraborty P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 1193-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Russell, D. G., (ed) (1994) Methods in Cell Biology, pp. 277–288, Academic Press, New York.Google Scholar). Sections were probed with rabbit antibody raised against a synthetic peptide YPYDVPDYASL, corresponding to the influenza hemagglutinin tag, coupled to ovalbumin. The anti-HA antibody was affinity-purified on peptide-Sepharose and used at 1 μg/ml diluted in Hepes saline with 5× fetal bovine serum and 5× goat serum. Binding of primary antibody was visualized by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 18 nm gold (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Controls were conducted with non-transfected promastigotes and by omission of the primary antibody. Under the conditions used background labeling remained below 4× of the specific label. L. donovani parasites were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation, centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove large organelles, and sealed microsomal vesicles were obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g The integrity of the microsomal vesicles was estimated by measuring the latency of galactosyltransferase to proteolytic digestion with trypsin (19Fleischer B. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The results from this intactness assay indicated that at least 90× of the vesicles were sealed in the proper orientation (data not shown). To optimize conditions for transport of GDP-Man into Leishmania microsomal vesicles, it was important to establish that transport had characteristics of a protein carrier-mediated system. GDP-Man transport was: (i) time-dependent with linearity up to 6 min (Fig. 1A), (ii) temperature-dependent with approximately 15× of the activity at 4°C compared to that obtained at 28°C, and (iii) protein-dependent with linearity from 0.05-0.3 mg (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 2, transport was saturable with an apparent Km of 0.3 μM for GDP-Man and a Vmax of 25 pmol/mg/6 min. Under identical assay conditions, no transport of CMP-NANA was observed whereas the transport of GDP-fucose was approximately 5× the rate compared to GDP-Man. On the other hand, translocation of UDP-Gal into the microsomal vesicles was substantial (detailed below) as would be expected due to its utilization for lumenal synthesis of LPG and related glycoconjugates.Fig. 2GDP-Man uptake by Leishmania microsomes is saturable. GDP-Man transport assays contained reaction buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”), microsomes (1 mg), and the indicated concentration of GDP-[14C]Man (540 cpm/pmol) in a total volume of 200 μl. After incubation for 6 min at 28°C, the amount of GDP-Man transported into the vesicles was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inset, Eadie plot. S, substrate; V, velocity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The requirement for an intact permeability barrier for GDP-Man transport was demonstrated by showing that uptake of the nucleotide-sugar was abolished when the vesicles were incubated with 0.1× (w/v) Triton X-100 (Table I). Furthermore, in the absence of detergent, GDP-Man transport was completely abrogated by DIDS, a stilbene derivative that has been utilized as an inhibitor of nucleotide-sugar transport into mammalian Golgi vesicles (24Passow H. Habermann E. Reviews of Physiology and Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 61-203Google Scholar, 25Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Transport was also inhibited by pretreatment of the microsomal vesicles with protease XIV (Table I), suggesting the presence of an important cytoplasmically oriented domain of the transporter. GDP-Man transport was not affected significantly by the addition of 10 μM mannose, 10 μM mannose 1-phosphate, or 1 mM EDTA (data not shown).Table ITransport of GDP-[14C]Man after a 2-min incubationIncubation mixtureAmountpmol/mgComplete31+ Triton X-100 (0.1×)<1+ DIDS (4 mM)<1+ Protease XIV (6 units)<1 Open table in a new tab To provide direct evidence that GDP-[14C]Man was transported into the lumen of the membrane vesicles, the nature of [14C]mannose-labeled, vesicle-associated material was studied. Following a 6-min incubation of the vesicles with GDP-[14C]Man, the vesicles were washed by filtration and then extracted with organic solvents to isolate LPG and water-soluble solutes. [14C]LPG accounted for the majority (75×) of the vesicular radioactivity. This was as expected since the glycosyltransferases involved in the assembly of repeat units of LPG and cap structure are lumenally oriented and would have been able to utilize the transported nucleotide-sugar as a donor substrate. The remaining radioactivity (25×) was water-soluble, and an aliquot was subjected to TLC (Fig. 3). The main peak of radioactivity co-migrated with standard GDP-Man. The water-soluble 14C-labeled material was confirmed further as GDP-[14C]Man by chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose according to the method of Rush and Waechter (21Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, GDP-[14C]Man binds to the lectin and can be eluted in the presence of α-methylmannoside. Prior to chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose, pretreatment of another aliquot of the sample under mild acid conditions that cleaves the labile nucleotide-sugar resulted in quantitative recovery of radioactivity in the void volume (Fig. 4B). In a key control experiment, only negligible radioactivity (<1× compared to wild type microsomal vesicles) was extractable using microsomal vesicles prepared from LPG-deficient C3PO parasites (discussed below).Fig. 4Concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography of aqueous soluble material in microsomal vesicles. Following a 6-min incubation of vesicles with 0.16 μCi of GDP-[14C]Man (3 μM) at 28°C, an aliquot of the desalted, aqueous-soluble sample was chromatographed on a column of concanavalin A-Sepharose (4 ml) equilibrated in 15 mM ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, containing 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM MnCl2. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer for 40 fractions (0.6 ml/fraction). The arrow designates the fraction number at which the elution was switched to an equilibration buffer containing 50 mMα-methylmannoside. Panel A, no mild acid pretreatment. Panel B, the sample was pretreated with 0.02 N HCl, 5 min, 100°C, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended in equilibration buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Among the possible roles for LPG2 transporter activity, we considered transport of GDP-Man since Man-P addition to the glycan core is the first step of repeating unit biosynthesis (see Introduction). In these studies we made use of mutants lacking the LPG2 gene (C3PO) and of C3PO to which LPG2 expression had been restored by transfection of a LPG2 expression vector (pX63HYG-LPG2). First, the relative ability to transport GDP-[14C]Man was assayed in microsomal vesicles. As shown in Table II, vesicles from C3PO cells failed to transport significant amounts of GDP-[14C]Man. This defect, in turn, was responsible for the inability of sealed vesicles to synthesize sizable amounts of LPG in vitro in the absence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 5, lower panel), since without translocation the precursor would be unavailable inside vesicles. Incorporation of radioactive mannose from GDP-[14C]Man into LPG could only occur when the vesicles were unsealed with concentrations of at least 0.1× Triton X-100. In contrast, vesicles from wild type cells were able to carry out LPG synthesis using GDP-[14C]Man, in the absence or presence of the detergent (Fig. 5, upper panel), as anticipated with a functional GDP-Man transporter. The higher concentrations of detergent were found to have a partial inhibitory effect on LPG synthesis activity as reported previously (10Carver M.A. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10974-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IITransport of nucleotide-sugars in vesicles from wild type, C3PO, or LPG2-transfected C3PO cellsVesiclesGDP-ManUDP-GalLPG synthesis×××Wild type100100100C3PO3 ± 0.172 ± 9.24.4 ± 0.5C3PO(LPG2)-5013 ± 0.290 ± 6.431.6 ± 1.0C3PO(LPG2)-10041 ± 2.878 ± 12.041.6 ± 1.3C3PO(LPG2)-25052 ± 3.971 ± 5.040.0 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab An examination of GDP-[14C]Man transport using vesicles prepared from C3PO cells transfected with LPG2 resulted in restoration of approximately 13× of wild type transport levels (Table II). We reasoned that the low level of transport reflect relatively weak expression of LPG2, which was carried on a large cosmid vector. Since elevated drug pressure is known to increase episomal plasmid copy number (26Kapler G.M. Zhang K. Beverley S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6399-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the hygromycin B concentration was increased from 50 to 100 and then 250 μg/ml, and the cells grown for several passages. Microsomal vesicles were prepared from these transfectants, and assayed for GDP-[14C]Man transport. As shown in Table II, there was a proportional increase in in vitro GDP-[14C]Man transport activity using vesicles from LPG2-transfected cells selected with elevated amounts of hygromycin B. Significantly, alterations in GDP-Man uptake were specific, as no alterations in uptake of UDP-[3H]Gal were observed in sealed vesicles from wild type, C3PO, and C3PO cells transfected with the LPG2 gene and maintained in various concentrations of hygromycin B (Table II). In an earlier study (17Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), an epitope-tagged LPG2 protein was detected in a region of the parasite between the nucleus and the kinetoplast, which is where the parasite Golgi apparatus lies. We used immunoelectron microscopy to confirm whether the LPG2 protein was localized to the Golgi apparatus. The LPG2-HA construct described previously was transfected into the C3PO mutant, where it restored the LPG+ phenotype (17Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). By electron microscope-gold immunostaining techniques utilizing an antibody that recognizes the HA tag, particles were observed only in the Golgi cisternae that are located near the flagellar pocket (Fig. 6B). In all trypanosomatids the Golgi is represented as a stack of flattened membraneous vesicles that abut the flagellar pocket (Fig. 6A), which is the sole demonstrated site of secretion of proteins and carbohydrate complexes from these organisms (7Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Russell D.G. Hohenberg H. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Examination of areas where the vesicles of the Golgi are distended indicate that the majority of the label (the C terminus of the LPG2 protein bearing the HA tag in this construct) is associated with the lumenal face of the membrane, (Fig. 6C). A topological need for a transporter of GDP-Man, as well as UDP-Gal, in the Golgi apparatus of Leishmania is understandable based upon our current knowledge of repeating unit assembly of LPG and other phosphoglycan-containing glycoconjugates. Biosynthesis occurs in the Golgi, and consistent with this finding, the protein encoded by the LPG2 gene was clearly localized by immunoelectron microscopy to the Golgi apparatus with the C terminus of the protein being lumenally oriented. Other LPG biosynthetic genes have also been localized to the Golgi apparatus (28Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Evidence for the existence of a transporter for GDP-Man in Leishmania resulted from the development of an in vitro transport assay involving sealed microsomal vesicles. GDP-Man transport exhibited the normal properties of a protein-mediated system, including selectivity of solutes and sensitivity to protease. Furthermore, transport was inhibited by DIDS, a commonly used inhibitor of nucleotide-sugar transport in mammalian Golgi vesicles. Of particular importance, GDP-Man was discovered within the sealed Leishmania vesicles following a timed incubation. Once inside, the nucleotide-sugar was used as a substrate for LPG synthesis. Identically prepared vesicles from C3PO cells neither transported the substrate nor incorporated the sugar into LPG unless the vesicles were unsealed with detergent. In mammalian Golgi vesicles, nucleotide-sugar transporters are classified as antiporters since transport is always coupled to the exit of the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate (25Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The GDP-Man transporter in yeast is believed to operate via a"

Inactivation is usually greatly accelerated if Ba2+ is replaced by Ca2+ (2Eckert R. Chad J.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 215-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The channels are also designated as L-type and are multisubunit proteins composed of the pore-forming α1C subunit, which contains high affinity binding sites for DHPs (3Regulla S. Schneider T.

Analysis of the hydrophobicity profile of α1C indicates four repetitive motifs of similarity (I-IV), each composed of six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) (10Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Both, the short amino-terminal tail encoded by exons 1 and 2, and the long carboxyl-terminal tail encoded by exons 38-50 of the human α1C gene (11Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) are located in the cytoplasm.Expression of α1C is regulated through alternative splicing (12Perez-Reyes E. Wei X. Castellano A. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20430-20436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has primarily been detected in the membrane-spanning regions of the molecule. However, there is evidence that the carboxyl-terminal tail is also affected by alternative splicing. Two partial transcripts have been identified in a cDNA library of human hippocampus (11Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Soldatov N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4628-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). They show that exons 40-43 encoding the second quarter of the putative cytoplasmic tail of the α1C molecule are subject to alternative splicing and may give rise to new α1C splice variants in the brain.The functional role of the carboxyl-terminal tail attracts much attention because of its potential involvement in channel gating. Removal of approximately 70% of the tail causes an increase in the opening probability of the rabbit cardiac α1C channel (14Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar deletion mutant of the human cardiac α1C showed faster inactivation of the channel as compared to the wild-type channel (15Klöckner U. Mikala G. Varadi M. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17306-17310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has been concluded that this tail part of α1C may serve as a critical component of the gating structure that influences inactivation properties of the channel (15Klöckner U. Mikala G. Varadi M. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17306-17310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In this report we describe two recombinant plasmids, pHLCC72 and pHLCC86, which contain alternative exons encoding parts of the carboxyl-terminal tails that are found in human hippocampus transcripts. After expression in Xenopus oocytes, we have analyzed electrophysiological properties of α1C,72 and α1C,86 channels and compared them with the reference α1C,77 channel (16Soldatov N.M. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10540-10543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The results of our study show that amino acids encoded by exons 40-42 are important for the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation of the current through these channels, as well as for the kinetics and Ca2+ dependence of inactivation.DISCUSSIONAlternative splicing of the α1 subunit of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels contributes to the structural diversity of these ion channels, but only little is known about its functional importance. It has been shown that alternative splicing of the gene encoding the α1C subunit of L-type Ca2+ channels contributes to differences in the voltage dependence of the sensitivity toward DHPs (16Soldatov N.M. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10540-10543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and to the DHP tissue selectivity (31Welling A. Kwan Y.W. Bosse E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated electrophysiologically three putative splice variants of the human class C L-type Ca2+ channel.We show that a segment of 80 amino acids replaced in α1C,77 by a nonidentical sequence of 81 amino acids of α1C,86 in the second quarter of the 662-amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail (1572-1651) caused a 10-fold increase in the rate of inactivation, an 11-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation, and elimination of Ca2+-dependent inactivation, as well as an increase in the affinity of the channel to the DHP blocker (+)-isradipine. Some but not all of these effects were also partially visible in the α1C,72 channel. It is structurally identical to the reference 2138-amino acid α1C,77 channel, except for an insertion of 19 amino acids at position 1575 between sequences encoded by exons 40 and 41. There was a 5-mV hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage dependence of inactivation, the kinetics of inactivation of IBa through α1C,72 was only 20% faster than that through α1C,77 (Table TI), and the DHP sensitivity of α1C,72 was the same as that of α1C,86 but about 4 times higher than that of α1C,77 (Table TIII).Over the last few years, a multitude of studies have shed light on the molecular basis of Ca2+ channel inactivation. It has been suggested that voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivation are regulated by distinct sites on the α1C subunit (32Parent L. Gopalakrishnan M. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1801-1813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The structural determinants for voltage-dependent inactivation have been attributed to sequences near or in the S6 segments of domains I, III, and IV of the α1 subunit (33Zhang J. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 34Yatani A. Bahinski A. Wakamori M. Tang S. Mori Y. Kobayashi T. Schwartz A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Substituting as few as 9 amino acids from a rapidly inactivating class A Ca2+ channel near the transmembrane region IS6 for homologous residues in the α1C subunit was sufficient to transform α1C into a fast inactivating channel (33Zhang J. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). More recently several studies have implicated carboxyl-terminal segments as being involved in voltage-dependent inactivation (15Klöckner U. Mikala G. Varadi M. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17306-17310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Schmid R. Seydl K. Baumgartner W. Groschner K. Romanin C. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1847-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The membrane-spanning regions, and consequently the voltage sensor in the S4 segments (36Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), are structurally identical in all three splice variants of α1C studied in our work. The new amino acid sequences in the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail, encoded by alternative exons in α1C,72 and α1C,86, do not show hydrophobic stretches that would suggest their insertion into the plasma membrane. The differences in the voltage dependence of gating between α1C,77, α1C,72, and α1C,86 may, therefore, be due to an altered interaction of cytoplasmic amino acid sequences with the intramembrane voltage sensor in the S4 segments of the α1C protein. For example, a direct interaction of the amino acids encoded by exons 40-42 with the cytoplasmic ends of the charged transmembrane segments S4 may affect the mobility of the charged regions in response to a change in the transmembrane electric field (37Yang N.B. George A.L. Horn R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). This could influence the transitions between open and closed states of the channel depending on the conformational flexibility of the cytoplasmic polypeptide chains, which may be highest for the α1C,86 channel. However, we cannot rule out that the fast inactivation observed in α1C,86 may be due to some modulatory effect on the interaction with auxiliary subunits, which are known to influence Ca2+ channel inactivation properties (38Isom L.L. De-Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar).Ca2+-dependent inactivation seems to be mediated directly by binding of Ca2+ ions to the channel (39Imredy J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1301-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Elimination of the Ca2+ selectivity by the E1145Q mutation in the pore region of repeat III of rabbit cardiac α1C was associated with a loss of Ca2+-dependent inactivation (27Zong S. Zhou J. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A Ca2+ binding site has also been implicated for a carboxyl-terminal segment near the transmembrane region IVS6 that includes a putative Ca2+ binding EF-hand motif (40Babitch J. Nature. 1990; 346: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 41Tsien R.W. Ellinor P.T. Horne W.A. Trends Pharmacol.

Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This motif is essential for Ca2+-dependent inactivation, although additional residues downstream to the EF-domain are required to exhibit the full effect (42DeLeon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E.

Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17306-17310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and endogenous Ca2+ channels in ventricular myocytes (35Schmid R. Seydl K. Baumgartner W. Groschner K. Romanin C. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1847-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) had any effect on Ca2+-dependent inactivation. However, in another study, Ca2+-dependent inactivation in ventricular myocytes was abolished by trypsin digestion (46You Y.D. Pelzer D.J. Pelzer S. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1838-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), indicating that there is a limit to the extent by which the carboxyl terminus can be shortened before inactivation is impaired.Our data show that substituting a stretch of 81 amino acids of α1C,86 for a segment of 80 amino acids in α1C,77 not only affects voltage-dependent inactivation, it also eliminates Ca2+-dependent inactivation. This substitution left the four putative transmembrane domains and the EF-hand motif intact. These structural regions are identical in both α1C constructs. Thus, our study supports recent observations (43Wang Y. DeLeon M. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Olcese R. Zhou J. Qim N. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E.

Perez-Reyes E. Wei X.Y. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We could narrow down a carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain to a segment of maximally 81 amino acids.Our studies have shown an alternatively spliced segment in the carboxyl terminus of the human α1C subunit, which determines inactivation properties of the Ca2+ channel. It remains to be elucidated which parts and residues encoded by exons 40-42 are involved in voltage-dependent inactivation and whether these same sites are responsible for abolishing Ca2+-dependent inactivation of α1C,86. Furthermore, it will be of great importance to clarify whether an α1C,86-like splice variant is a functional class C Ca2+ channel in the brain.

The results of our study show that amino acids encoded by exons 40-42 are important for the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation of the current through these channels, as well as for the kinetics and Ca2+ dependence of inactivation. DISCUSSIONAlternative splicing of the α1 subunit of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels contributes to the structural diversity of these ion channels, but only little is known about its functional importance. It has been shown that alternative splicing of the gene encoding the α1C subunit of L-type Ca2+ channels contributes to differences in the voltage dependence of the sensitivity toward DHPs (16Soldatov N.M. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10540-10543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and to the DHP tissue selectivity (31Welling A. Kwan Y.W. Bosse E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated electrophysiologically three putative splice variants of the human class C L-type Ca2+ channel.We show that a segment of 80 amino acids replaced in α1C,77 by a nonidentical sequence of 81 amino acids of α1C,86 in the second quarter of the 662-amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail (1572-1651) caused a 10-fold increase in the rate of inactivation, an 11-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation, and elimination of Ca2+-dependent inactivation, as well as an increase in the affinity of the channel to the DHP blocker (+)-isradipine. Some but not all of these effects were also partially visible in the α1C,72 channel. It is structurally identical to the reference 2138-amino acid α1C,77 channel, except for an insertion of 19 amino acids at position 1575 between sequences encoded by exons 40 and 41. There was a 5-mV hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage dependence of inactivation, the kinetics of inactivation of IBa through α1C,72 was only 20% faster than that through α1C,77 (Table TI), and the DHP sensitivity of α1C,72 was the same as that of α1C,86 but about 4 times higher than that of α1C,77 (Table TIII).Over the last few years, a multitude of studies have shed light on the molecular basis of Ca2+ channel inactivation. It has been suggested that voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivation are regulated by distinct sites on the α1C subunit (32Parent L. Gopalakrishnan M. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1801-1813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The structural determinants for voltage-dependent inactivation have been attributed to sequences near or in the S6 segments of domains I, III, and IV of the α1 subunit (33Zhang J. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 34Yatani A. Bahinski A. Wakamori M. Tang S. Mori Y. Kobayashi T. Schwartz A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Substituting as few as 9 amino acids from a rapidly inactivating class A Ca2+ channel near the transmembrane region IS6 for homologous residues in the α1C subunit was sufficient to transform α1C into a fast inactivating channel (33Zhang J. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). More recently several studies have implicated carboxyl-terminal segments as being involved in voltage-dependent inactivation (15Klöckner U. Mikala G. Varadi M. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17306-17310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Schmid R. Seydl K. Baumgartner W. Groschner K. Romanin C. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1847-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The membrane-spanning regions, and consequently the voltage sensor in the S4 segments (36Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), are structurally identical in all three splice variants of α1C studied in our work. The new amino acid sequences in the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail, encoded by alternative exons in α1C,72 and α1C,86, do not show hydrophobic stretches that would suggest their insertion into the plasma membrane. The differences in the voltage dependence of gating between α1C,77, α1C,72, and α1C,86 may, therefore, be due to an altered interaction of cytoplasmic amino acid sequences with the intramembrane voltage sensor in the S4 segments of the α1C protein. For example, a direct interaction of the amino acids encoded by exons 40-42 with the cytoplasmic ends of the charged transmembrane segments S4 may affect the mobility of the charged regions in response to a change in the transmembrane electric field (37Yang N.B. George A.L. Horn R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). This could influence the transitions between open and closed states of the channel depending on the conformational flexibility of the cytoplasmic polypeptide chains, which may be highest for the α1C,86 channel. However, we cannot rule out that the fast inactivation observed in α1C,86 may be due to some modulatory effect on the interaction with auxiliary subunits, which are known to influence Ca2+ channel inactivation properties (38Isom L.L. De-Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar).Ca2+-dependent inactivation seems to be mediated directly by binding of Ca2+ ions to the channel (39Imredy J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1301-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Elimination of the Ca2+ selectivity by the E1145Q mutation in the pore region of repeat III of rabbit cardiac α1C was associated with a loss of Ca2+-dependent inactivation (27Zong S. Zhou J. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A Ca2+ binding site has also been implicated for a carboxyl-terminal segment near the transmembrane region IVS6 that includes a putative Ca2+ binding EF-hand motif (40Babitch J. Nature. 1990; 346: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 41Tsien R.W. Ellinor P.T. Horne W.A. Trends Pharmacol.

Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This motif is essential for Ca2+-dependent inactivation, although additional residues downstream to the EF-domain are required to exhibit the full effect (42DeLeon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E. Wei X.Y. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 43Wang Y. DeLeon M. Yue D.T. Biophys.

J. 1996; 70: A238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). On the other hand, neither truncation of up to 70% of the carboxyl-terminal tail of cloned α1C subunits (15Klöckner U. Mikala G. Varadi M. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17306-17310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Zong X.G. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) nor cytoplasmic modification by trypsin of cloned cardiac Ca2+ channels in HEK 293 cells (15Klöckner U. Mikala G. Varadi M. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17306-17310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and endogenous Ca2+ channels in ventricular myocytes (35Schmid R. Seydl K. Baumgartner W. Groschner K. Romanin C. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1847-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) had any effect on Ca2+-dependent inactivation. However, in another study, Ca2+-dependent inactivation in ventricular myocytes was abolished by trypsin digestion (46You Y.D. Pelzer D.J. Pelzer S. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1838-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), indicating that there is a limit to the extent by which the carboxyl terminus can be shortened before inactivation is impaired.Our data show that substituting a stretch of 81 amino acids of α1C,86 for a segment of 80 amino acids in α1C,77 not only affects voltage-dependent inactivation, it also eliminates Ca2+-dependent inactivation. This substitution left the four putative transmembrane domains and the EF-hand motif intact. These structural regions are identical in both α1C constructs. Thus, our study supports recent observations (43Wang Y. DeLeon M. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Olcese R. Zhou J. Qim N. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E.

J. 1996; 70: A238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) suggesting that the EF-hand motif is not the only determinant of Ca2+-dependent inactivation (42DeLeon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E. Wei X.Y. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We could narrow down a carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain to a segment of maximally 81 amino acids.Our studies have shown an alternatively spliced segment in the carboxyl terminus of the human α1C subunit, which determines inactivation properties of the Ca2+ channel. It remains to be elucidated which parts and residues encoded by exons 40-42 are involved in voltage-dependent inactivation and whether these same sites are responsible for abolishing Ca2+-dependent inactivation of α1C,86. Furthermore, it will be of great importance to clarify whether an α1C,86-like splice variant is a functional class C Ca2+ channel in the brain. Alternative splicing of the α1 subunit of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels contributes to the structural diversity of these ion channels, but only little is known about its functional importance. It has been shown that alternative splicing of the gene encoding the α1C subunit of L-type Ca2+ channels contributes to differences in the voltage dependence of the sensitivity toward DHPs (16Soldatov N.M.

This motif is essential for Ca2+-dependent inactivation, although additional residues downstream to the EF-domain are required to exhibit the full effect (42DeLeon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E.

However, in another study, Ca2+-dependent inactivation in ventricular myocytes was abolished by trypsin digestion (46You Y.D. Pelzer D.J. Pelzer S. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1838-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), indicating that there is a limit to the extent by which the carboxyl terminus can be shortened before inactivation is impaired. Our data show that substituting a stretch of 81 amino acids of α1C,86 for a segment of 80 amino acids in α1C,77 not only affects voltage-dependent inactivation, it also eliminates Ca2+-dependent inactivation. This substitution left the four putative transmembrane domains and the EF-hand motif intact. These structural regions are identical in both α1C constructs. Thus, our study supports recent observations (43Wang Y. DeLeon M. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Olcese R. Zhou J. Qim N. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E.

We could narrow down a carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain to a segment of maximally 81 amino acids. Our studies have shown an alternatively spliced segment in the carboxyl terminus of the human α1C subunit, which determines inactivation properties of the Ca2+ channel. It remains to be elucidated which parts and residues encoded by exons 40-42 are involved in voltage-dependent inactivation and whether these same sites are responsible for abolishing Ca2+-dependent inactivation of α1C,86. Furthermore, it will be of great importance to clarify whether an α1C,86-like splice variant is a functional class C Ca2+ channel in the brain. We thank F. Hofmann (Munich) and V.

https://openalex.org/W2090109575,"We have examined the function of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, c-Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the progression of colon cancer using an in vitro progression model. A non-tumorigenic cell line was derived from a premalignant colonic adenoma (PC/AA) from which a clonogenic variant was established (AA/C1). Following sequential treatment with sodium butyrate and the carcinogen N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine an anchorage-independent line was isolated which, with time in culture, became tumorigenic when injected into athymic nude mice (AA/C1/SB10). We have shown that both EGF receptor and FAK protein levels were elevated in the carcinoma cells as compared to the adenoma cells, while the expression and activity of c-Src were unaltered during the adenoma to carcinoma transition. EGF induced the movement of the carcinoma cells into a reconstituted basement membrane which was not seen with the premalignant adenoma cells. This increased motility was accompanied by an EGF-induced increase in c-Src kinase activity, relocalisation of c-Src to the cell periphery and phosphorylation of FAK in the carcinoma cells but not in the adenoma cells. This suggests that c-Src plays a role in the biological behaviour of colonic carcinoma cells induced by migratory factors such as EGF, perhaps acting in conjunction with FAK to regulate focal adhesion turnover and tumour cell motility. Furthermore, although c-Src has been implicated in colonic tumour progression, we demonstrate here that in the adenoma to carcinoma in vitro model c-Src is not the driving force for this progression but co-operates with other molecules in carcinoma development."

In vitro analysis reveals two major sites of PKC phosphorylation within the C-terminal 26 amino acids of GRK5. GRK5 phosphorylation by PKC dramatically reduces its ability to phosphorylate both receptor (light-activated rhodopsin) and non-receptor (casein and phosvitin) substrates. Kinetic analysis reveals an ∼5-fold increased Km and ∼3-fold decreased Vmax for rhodopsin, with no change in the Km for ATP. The reduced affinity of PKC-phosphorylated GRK5 for rhodopsin was also evident in a decreased ability to bind to rhodopsin-containing membranes, while direct binding of GRK5 to phospholipids appeared unaltered.

Protein phosphorylation is known to be a very important means of cellular regulation, and in recent years much information about protein kinases and phosphatases, especially those involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, has been obtained (for review, see Refs. 1Guan K.L. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 2Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar, 3Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J.

CK2 is a multifunctional, second messenger-independent eukaryotic protein serine/threonine kinase present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. The holoenzyme form is generally composed of catalytic subunits α, α′, and a regulatory subunit β combined so as to form α2β2, αα′β2, or α′2β2 heterotetramers. The α and α′ subunits are catalytically active, whereas the β subunit is inactive but can stimulate the catalytic activity of α and α′ under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the β subunit stabilizes the α and α′ subunits and can facilitate substrate recognition (4Issinger O.-G. Pharmacol &. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). CK2 is widely expressed, and its sequence is highly conserved throughout evolution, indicating that the enzyme may have a critical role in cell function. In fact, it has been shown in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that the simultaneous disruption of genes encoding CK2 α and α′ subunits is lethal (5Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). CK2 phosphorylates a large number of proteins including enzymes involved in nucleic acid synthesis, transcription and protein synthesis factors, structural proteins, and signal transduction proteins, suggesting a global role in the regulation of cellular processes (6Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Several recent studies demonstrate that CK2 is important for cell growth and division. First, it has been shown that CK2 activity is required for progression of the cell cycle (7Pepperkok R. Lorenz P. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6986-6991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol.

Pharmacol &. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Second, CK2 reportedly associates with several growth-related proteins including p53 (9Filhol O. Baudier J. Delphin C. Loue-Mackenbach P. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20577-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), c-Raf (10Janosch P. Schellerer M. Seitz T. Reim P. Eulitz M.

G. Krebs, and J. A. Cooper, submitted for publication. Most strikingly, overexpression of CK2α in transgenic mice caused a high predisposition for lymphoma development, and coexpression of the CK2α transgene with c-myc resulted in the rapid development of murine perinatal leukemia associated with disruption of lymphoid cell functions (12Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In spite of the above mentioned studies, it is still not entirely clear exactly what physiological roles CK2 may have and how the activity of this enzyme is regulated in vivo CK2 has a vast number of the potential substrates. It is generally considered constitutively active (13Litchfield D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 373-381PubMed Google Scholar) and is not known to respond to any second messenger molecules. These features makes it difficult to study the function and regulation of this enzyme (for review, see Refs. 4Issinger O.-G. Pharmacol &. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 6Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 14Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv.

Therefore, efforts have been made to search for proteins that interact with CK2 for a greater understanding of its role. For example, the nucleolar protein nucleolin was identified as a CK2-associating protein in previous work (16Caizergues-Ferrer M. Belenguer P. Lapeyre B. Amalric F. Wallace M.O. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar–18Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence that CK2 and the nucleolar protein Nopp140 associate as a molecular complex in vitro and probably in vivo These studies were performed using immobilized GST fusion proteins of CK2 subunits and a 32P-radiolabeled CK2 overlay technique and by coimmunoprecipitation of the two proteins from cell extracts. The region of the β subunit of CK2 which binds to Nopp140 was also mapped. The possible roles of CK2 in the regulation of Nopp140 as well as in rRNA synthesis and ribosomal protein transport are supported by the results of this study. Nucleotide oligomers used as polymerase chain reaction primers were synthesized by Drs. Y. F. Lee and P. S. H. Chou (Biopolymer Facility, Department of Immunology, University of Washington) and by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. BL-21 (DE3) pLysS competent cells were purchased from Novogen. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham. The PD-10 gel filtration column and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant CK2 subunits α and α′ and holoenzymes α2β2 and α′2β2 were expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells as described elsewhere. 3G. Dobrowolska, F. Lozeman, D. Li, and E. G. Krebs, manuscript in preparation. Recombinant Nopp140 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) cells transformed with pET8c/Nopp140 (Nopp140 bacterial expression vector). Since the overexpressed Nopp140 protein was predominantly insoluble and segregated into inclusion bodies, it was denatured and renatured by solubilization in 6 M urea followed by extensive dilution and then purified using a hydroxylapatite column (19Meier U.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19376-19384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies of Nopp140 were raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide of Nopp140 (20Meier U.T. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 70: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against CK2 subunits α, α′, and β were prepared in this laboratory (21Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Cicirelli M.F. Harrylock M. Ericsson L.H. Piening C.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20380-20389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3 L1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum until confluence. The cells were washed by phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaF, 0.25 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25 M sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated twice for 10 s. After centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 rpm, the supernatants were used as cell lysates. Deletion mutants of GST-CK2β were constructed by truncating the NH2-terminal (Δ1-20, Δ1-40, Δ1-80, Δ1-120, Δ1-141) and COOH-terminal (Δ161-215) amino acids of CK2β to give mutants GST-β21-215, GST-β41-215, GST-β81-215, GST-β121-215, GST-β142-215, and GST-β1-160. The cDNA for each deletion mutant was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of human CK2β in Bluescript KS plasmid (22Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For NH2-terminal deletion mutations, the sense polymerase chain reaction primers were: 5′-GCGGATCCTTCTTCTGTGAAGTGGATG-3′ (GST-β21-215); 5′-GCGGATCCGAGCAGGTCCCTCACTATC-3′ (GST-β41-215); 5′-GCGGATCCGGATTGATCCACGCCCGCT-3′ (GST-β81-215); 5′-GCGGATCCCCCATTGGCCTTTCAGACA-3′ (GST-β121-215); and 5′-GCGGATCCGATGTGTACACACCCAAGT-3′ (GST-β142-215). The T7 24-mer primer was used as the antisense primers for all of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants of CK2β. For the COOH-terminal deletion mutant, GST-β1-160, the sense primer was 5′-GCGGATCCAGCAGCTCAGAGGAGGTGT-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-GCGGATCCTCAGCCGAAGTAGGCGCCATCC-3′. After polymerase chain reaction, the DNA fragments were purified, digested with BamHI, and ligated into pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia). GST-CK2α, GST-CK2α′, and GST-CK2β and its deletion mutants were expressed in and purified from E. coli and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose resin (18Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The immobilized protein were eluted using an elution buffer containing 10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. To remove the GST tag from GST-CK2β, a thrombin cleavage procedure developed by Pharmacia was employed. GST fusion proteins of CK2 holoenzyme α2β2 and α′2β2 were generated by mixing an equal amount of the immobilized GST-CK2α with CK2β, or GST-CK2α′ with CK2β. 3T3 L1 cell lysates (200 μl) were incubated at 4°C either with 35 μl (50%; v/v) of glutathione beads immobilized with GST-CK2 fusion proteins (approximately 2 μg) for 4 h or with protein A-Sepharose conjugated with a mixture of antiserum against each CK2 subunit (18Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for 2 h. The beads were then washed four times with an immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.025% Triton X-100) by centrifugation. Bound proteins were extracted using Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies. Alternatively, the proteins bound to the immobilized CK2 were phosphorylated by GST-CK2 fusion proteins using a procedure described previously (18Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Approximately 10,000,000 BRL cells were washed twice and scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After pelleting, the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4; 1% Triton X-100; 0.2% SDS; 150 mM NaCl; 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin A) by tip sonication (five times for 30 s on ice). The cell lysate was clarified for 10 min in a microcentrifuge and incubated with 5 μg of anti-Nopp140 peptide IgGs in the absence and presence of 5 μM free competing peptide for 1 h at room temperature. The antibody-antigen complexes were adsorbed to 5 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for an additional 1-h incubation at room temperature. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS, 150 mM NaCl), and the antibody-antigen complexes were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (19Meier U.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19376-19384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant CK2 holoenzyme α2β2 (obtained from Sf-9 cells) was radiolabeled by autophosphorylation and then subjected to a PD-10 column (Pharmacia) to remove [γ-32P]ATP and other inorganic chemicals (18Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed pure Nopp140 was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was preincubated in Blotto blocking buffer (5% milk in 20 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 mM NaCl) overnight and then overlaid with 32P-labeled CK2 probe (in fresh Blotto) for 4 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the associated CK2 band was detected by autoradiography. Bovine serum albumin (1-2 μg) was also loaded on the same SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a negative control. Each of the recombinant CK2s: CK2α, CK2α′, α2β2, and α′2β2 (30-120 ng), was incubated at 30°C with 0.5 μg of recombinant Nopp140 in 25 μl of phosphorylation buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (2,000 cpm/pmol ATP)). After 30 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 8 μl of 4 × sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The protein phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. To test whether CK2-Nopp140 association would affect the catalytic activity of CK2, CK2 activity was assayed by a routine as well as a modified procedure. In the routine procedure, the assay was carried out in the same way as described previously (23Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Piening C. Sommercorn J. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

In the modified procedure, CK2 holoenzyme was preincubated with [γ-32P]ATP in a reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (2,000 cpm/pmol)), with and without Nopp140 protein (0.075 mg/ml), for 20 min at 30°C. Then, CK2 substrate peptide RRRDDDSDDD (DSD; final concentration 0.1 mM) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for another 10 min. Aliquots of reaction mixture was spotted onto P81 paper, washed, and assayed as described previously (23Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

To examine the activation of CK2α by deletion mutants of CK2β, CK2 assays were conducted using baculovirus-expressed CK2α (approximately 5 ng for each reaction) and bacterially expressed and purified GST-CK2β mutants. CK2α was premixed with GST-CK2β mutants for 10 min at room temperature prior to the assay to allow proper folding of the holoenzyme. An excess amount of CK2β compared with CK2α was used in this experiment to give maximal stimulation (23Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Piening C. Sommercorn J. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7638-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-CK2 holoenzymes were reconstituted in vitro by incubating bacterially expressed, immobilized GST-CK2α or GST-CK2α′ with CK2β (obtained by thrombin cleavage of GST tag from GST-CK2β) and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose resin. These forms were then incubated with 3T3 L1 cell lysates for 4 h at 4°C. After extensive washing, phosphorylation reactions were initiated by adding a buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP and MgCl2 to the beads (18Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and stopped using Laemmli sample buffer. The phosphorylated CK2-interacting proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1). Several CK2-associated phosphoproteins were detected from the GST-CK2 resin, which had been incubated with cell lysates (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2) compared with the control experiment (lane 3), which shows only the autophosphorylation of the CK2 holoenzyme. Among them, one protein of 140 kDa was the most highly phosphorylated and bound to both forms of the CK2 holoenzyme. One possible candidate for the highly phosphorylated protein p140 was a nucleolar protein, Nopp140, known to be a very good CK2 substrate and known to migrate on SDS gels with a similar molecular weight (20Meier U.T. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 70: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against protein Nopp140 was used to test this possibility. A binding experiment using GST-CK2 fusion proteins as described above was conducted, except that the phosphorylation step was omitted, and the CK2 interacting proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and examined by Nopp140 immunoblotting. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, anti-Nopp140 antiserum recognized a protein of 140 kDa which bound to both GST-CK2 holoenzymes, GSTα+ CK2β and GSTα′+ CK2β (Fig. 2A, left and center lanes), but not to GST (right lane), suggesting a specific interaction between CK2 and Nopp140. To investigate which subunits of CK2 bind to Nopp140, immobilized GST fusion proteins of each CK2 subunit, GST-CK2α, GST-CK2α′, and GST-CK2β, were used for the type of binding experiment described above. A strong CK2β-Nopp140 interaction was detected when less than 2 μg of GST-CK2β was used (Fig. 2B, left lane), whereas no interaction was observed between Nopp140 and 2 μg of GST-CK2α, or Nopp140 and 2 μg of GST-CK2α′ (center and right lanes), suggesting that the CK2 holoenzyme-Nopp140 association most probably occurred through the β subunit of CK2. However, with a higher amount (between 5 and 10 μg) of GST-CK2α, detectable affinity toward Nopp140 was seen; GST-CK2α′ was associated very weakly with Nopp140 (data not shown). To clarify further whether the CK2-Nopp140 interaction is a direct association, a radioactive CK2 overlay experiment was carried out using 32P-labeled purified CK2 protein as a probe (18Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed pure Nopp140 protein was immobilized on the membrane as described (see “Experimental Procedures”). As demonstrated in Fig. 3, lane 1, Nopp140 did bind to the radiolabeled CK2 probe, whereas a control protein, bovine serum albumin (lane 2, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin), did not bind. This indicates that the CK2-Nopp140 interaction is specific and direct. It is noteworthy that in this experiment, a dephosphorylated form of Nopp140 was used because the purified Nopp140 was expressed in bacteria, giving a band of 100 kDa on the gel, whereas in intact cells, most of the Nopp140 is in a highly phosphorylated form (20Meier U.T. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 70: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Taken together, the experiments of Fig. 2, Fig. 3 make it seem very likely that the CK2-Nopp140 association is not dependent on the phosphorylation state of Nopp140. The association of CK2 and Nopp140 was also studied by coimmunoprecipitation of the two proteins from cell lysates. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Nopp140 was performed in 3T3 L1 cell lysates (data not shown) and BRL cell lysates (Fig. 4A), and in both cases CK2 was detected in the immunoprecipitates of Nopp140 when anti-CK2α antiserum was used for immunoblotting analysis. In addition to CK2, NAP57, a Nopp140-binding protein (25Meier U.T. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1505-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), was also coprecipitated with Nopp140 (Fig. 4A). The specific precipitation of Nopp140 and coprecipitation of NAP57 and CK2α are present only in the absence of competing peptide (−lanes). It was found that a significant amount of CK2 was complexed with Nopp140 in the coprecipitation experiment; as determined by immunoblotting, it was estimated that more than half of the total cellular CK2 was removed from the supernatants by precipitation with anti-Nopp140 antibodies (data not shown). In a parallel experiment, immunoprecipitation of endogenous CK2 from 3T3 L1 cell lysates was performed using a mixture of anti-CK2α, anti-CK2α′, and anti-CK2β antiserum. The presence of protein Nopp140 was examined by immunoblotting of the CK2 immunoprecipitate with a polyclonal anti-Nopp140 antiserum (20Meier U.T. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 70: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, Nopp140 was detected in the immunoprecipitate of CK2 (lane 2) but was not detected in the preimmune sera immunoprecipitate (lane 1), indicating a specific interaction of these two proteins. Together, coimmunoprecipitation of CK2 and Nopp140 suggested an in vivo association of these two proteins. GST-CK2β deletion mutants were prepared for mapping the region of CK2β subunit which associates with Nopp140. The constructs used are shown in Fig. 5A Expression of these deletion constructs produced NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal truncated GST-CK2β proteins. To characterize whether these deletion mutants could stimulate the activity of CK2α as the wild type β does, the enzymatic activity of the recombinant α subunit (from Sf-9 cells) was measured in the presence of an excess amount (five times more) of either wild type β subunit or the deletion mutants of β. As illustrated in Fig. 5B, at 30°C under our assay condition (with 0.1 M NaCl in final reaction mixture), CK2α showed very low activity because of the inhibition of NaCl (Fig. 5B, far left lane). Addition of the wild type GST-β protein greatly stimulated the catalytic activity of the α subunit (second lane). However, among all of the deletion mutants of β, only the mutant with deletion of the 20 NH2-terminal amino acids, GST-β21-215, could stimulate the activity of CK2α to the same extent as the wild type β (third lane). Deletion of amino acids 1-40 (GST-β41-215) greatly decreased the ability of β to activate CK2α (fourth lane), and further deletion up to first 80 amino acids (GST-β81-215) almost totally abolished the stimulation to α (fifth lane). This suggests that deletion of amino acids 21-80 causes a major structural change in the subunit. According to Kusk et al. (26Kusk M. Bendixen C. Duno M. Westergarrd O. Thomsen B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), from their study in the yeast two-hybrid system, amino acids 20-60 are needed for strong β-β interaction; so it is very possible that a tetrameric structure is needed to obtain full CK2 activity. Consistent with the data reported previously (27Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Pinna L. Issinger O.-G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 391-399PubMed Google Scholar, 28Marin O. Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Issinger O. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the COOH terminus of the β subunit was important for activating the α subunit because it is responsible for the α-β interaction; deletion of the COOH-terminal amino acids 160-215 caused a big decrease in the activation of the α subunit by β. Further investigation is under way to make a more thorough analysis of structure-function relationships in CK2β. The deletion mutants of CK2β were used in the in vitro CK2-Nopp140 binding studies. After incubating the immobilized GST-CK2β deletion mutants with 3T3 L1 cell lysates, the bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Nopp140 immunoblotting. Nopp140 was not detected in any of the eluates of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants (Fig. 5C, lanes 2-6) but was detected in the eluate from the COOH-terminal deletion mutant GST-CK2β1-160 (Fig. 5C, lane 7). Since GST-CK2β21-215 is the smallest NH2-terminal deletion, the lack of its binding ability to Nopp140 indicated that the first 20 NH2-terminal amino acids are most probably involved in the CK2-Nopp140 interaction. To understand how the CK2β subunit might affect the specificity of CK2 toward Nopp140 as a substrate, bacterially expressed Nopp140 was subjected to phosphorylation by baculovirus-expressed CK2 catalytic subunits α and α′ and by holoenzymes α2β2 and α′2β2. The phosphorylation reactions were carried out in a buffer without NaCl in order to have maximal α or α′ catalytic activity (α and α′ are inhibited by NaCl). When a high concentration of CK2 (120 ng) was used, Nopp140 was found to be phosphorylated efficiently by all of the forms of CK2 after incubation in a phosphorylation buffer for 10 min at 30°C; phosphorylation caused a gel mobility shift from 100 to 140 kDa (data not shown). However, when a lower amount of CK2 was used (approximately 30 ng), each form of holoenzyme, α2β2 and α′2β2, showed much higher specific activity toward Nopp140 than the monomeric active subunits, α and α′, although their relative activities toward a CK2 substrate peptide, DSD, had already been deliberately adjusted to the same level by dilution. Phosphorylation of Nopp140 by α′2β2 and α2β2 for 20 min at 30°C resulted in a massive incorporation of 32P and a significant gel mobility shift (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2), whereas phosphorylation by α and α′ under the same condition was much weaker and did not shift the band significantly (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4). From the densitometric reading, phosphorylation of Nopp140 by the holoenzymes CK2 was 4-fold higher than by the monomeric enzymes (Fig. 6B), indicating that Nopp140 is a much better substrate for the holoenzyme CK2 than for the monomeric α and α′ subunit. To examine the impact of the CK2-Nopp140 association on the enzymatic activity of CK2, CK2 was assayed in the presence or absence of Nopp140 using purified Sf-9 cell-expressed CK2 and bacterially expressed Nopp140. CK2 peptide substrate DSD was used for the assay. Besides the routine assay method (23Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Piening C. Sommercorn J. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7638-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a modified method in which Nopp140 was first phosphorylated for 20 min by CK2 followed by adding the DSD peptide to start the reaction, was also used to decrease the competition that might be caused by Nopp140 as an alternative substrate. In each case, no significant change of CK2 activity was detected when Nopp140 was present in the reaction mixture. This occurred even though it was possible that in the experiment using the alternative method Nopp140 phosphorylation may not have been absolutely complete at the point at which DSD was added. Also, a slightly lower [32P]ATP concentration would be present due to its utilization for Nopp140 phosphorylation. These factors would have been expected to decrease activity in the DSD phosphorylation reaction. In this study we have identified a nucleolar protein, Nopp140, as a CK2-associated protein. The interaction of the two proteins was shown to be direct and not dependent on the phosphorylation state of Nopp140. Furthermore, a possible in vivo interaction of CK2 and Nopp140 was suggested by the coimmunoprecipitation of the two proteins from cell lysates. Nopp140 was first isolated as a nuclear localization sequence-binding protein (29Meier U.T. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2235-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Immunostaining and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that Nopp140 is a nucleolar protein that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. A possible role of Nopp140 as a chaperone for import into or export from the nucleolus was suggested (20Meier U.T. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 70: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Having 49 phosphorylation consensus sites for CK2, and upon their phosphorylation an additional 33, Nopp140 can be highly phosphorylated by CK2 in intact cells (20Meier U.T. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 70: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), giving an apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Only phosphorylated Nopp140 binds to the nuclear localization sequence-containing peptide (20Meier U.T. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 70: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, a precise understanding of the function of Nopp140 and its phosphorylation by CK2 is not available. Our data showed that CK2 most probably interacts with Nopp140 through its β subunit, although some binding of the protein with the α subunit of CK2 was seen. One conceivable role of the CK2-Nopp140 interaction could be increasing the substrate specificity for Nopp140 phosphorylation. To address this point, monomeric forms of the enzyme, α and α′, and the holoenzymes, α2β2 and α′2β2, were used for the phosphorylation of Nopp140. It was found that Nopp140 was a much better substrate for the holoenzyme form of CK2. Until now, with nearly all substrates including the routinely used CK2 substrate peptide DSD, the holoenzyme form of CK2 always exhibits a higher activity than the monomeric α or α′ subunit. An approximately 3-5-fold stimulation of CK2α activity by CK2β has normally been observed when DSD peptide is used in the assay (18Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Sarno S. Boldyreff B. Marin O. Guerra B. Meggio F. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In our experiment in which we compare the ability of the α and α′ subunits to phosphorylate Nopp140 with that of the holoenzyme forms, we deliberately used a lower amount of the holoenzyme CK2 so as to give it the same catalytic activity as CK2α and CK2α′ toward the DSD peptide substrate. Under this condition, the holoenzymes still phosphorylated Nopp140 at four times the rate of either free α or α′. If normalized to the molarity level, an approximately 20-fold difference in phosphorylation could be estimated for the free catalytic subunit (α or α′) compared with holoenzyme CK2. This large difference could be partly due to the association between CK2β and Nopp140, thus favoring substrate recognition. However, because CK2 can also associate with the phosphorylated form of Nopp140, this specific CK2-Nopp140 interaction may also be correlated with other cellular functions of CK2 and Nopp140. CK2 has been shown to be a major nuclear protein (31Krek W. Maridor E. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Its growth-related accumulation in the nucleolus has also been observed (32Belenguer P. Baldin V. Mathieu C. Bensaid M. Bouche G. Amalric F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6626-6638Google Scholar, 33Pfaff M. Anderer F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The finding of the association of CK2 with Nopp140 suggests that CK2 may play an important role in the nucleolus. It has been shown that many nuclear localization sequence-interacting nucleolar proteins, including nucleolin, B23, Nopp140, and its associated protein NAP57 (25Meier U.T. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1505-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), are good substrates of CK2 and can migrate back and forth between the nucleus and cytoplasm (for review, see Ref. 34Shaw P.J. Jordan E.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 93-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These nucleolar proteins all have NH2-terminal domains containing stretches of acidic and serine residues with numerous CK2 phosphorylation sites, and the nuclear localization sequence binding ability of the protein seems to be dependent on their phosphorylation (for review, see Ref. 35Xue Z. Melese T. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 414-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, a major nucleolar protein, nucleolin, was also shown to be able to associate with CK2 in vitro and probably in vivo (16Caizergues-Ferrer M. Belenguer P. Lapeyre B. Amalric F. Wallace M.O. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar–18Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is possible that in addition to the phosphorylation, the association between CK2 and nucleolar proteins may represent another way of regulating the latter. The association of Nopp140 with CK2, together with phosphorylation, could affect its function in ribosomal protein transport. Interestingly, it was found recently that Nopp140 appears to be a growth-inhibiting protein, e.g. when rat Nopp140 was overexpressed in yeast, growth impairment was observed (19Meier U.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19376-19384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, SRP40, a yeast homolog of Nopp140, was identified by a genetic screen for genes that cause growth arrest when overexpressed (36Espinet C. De La Torre M.A. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1995; 11: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Indeed, when deletion and overexpression of SRP40 were conducted in yeast, deletion caused only minor growth impairment, but its overexpression resulted in a severe growth defect (19Meier U.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19376-19384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It would be of interest to know if the growth inhibitory function of Nopp140 is mediated both by phosphorylation and its association with CK2. Using deletion mutants of CK2β, the region at which CK2β binds to Nopp140 was mapped to the first 20 NH2-terminal amino acids, a domain containing the autophosphorylation sites of CK2 Ser-2 or Ser-3 (21Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Cicirelli M.F. Harrylock M. Ericsson L.H. Piening C.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20380-20389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since bacterially expressed GST-CK2β was used in the binding assay of these studies, the subunit should have been in its dephosphorylated form. On the other hand, in the overlay experiments, CK2 was radiolabeled by the autophosphorylation reaction in which Ser-2 and/or Ser-3 of the CK2β subunit would be phosphorylated. The CK2 bound to the membrane which was detected would have been phosphorylated. This indicates that both the dephosphorylated and the phosphorylated forms of CK2β can interact with Nopp140. From CK2 activity data (Fig. 5B), deletion of the 20 NH2-terminal amino acids gives a mutant that will still activate CK2α as well as the wild type β does. It is reasonable to assume that CK2 is still in its active form even when it is complexed with Nopp140, and this was indeed what we observed when CK2 activity toward the peptide substrate was measured in the presence of Nopp140. One interesting observation is that when higher amounts of GST fusion proteins of CK2α and CK2α′ were used in the binding assay, CK2α did exhibit affinity for Nopp140. By contrast, CK2α′ bound very weakly to Nopp140. This CK2α-Nopp140 interaction may have occurred indirectly through a separate protein, since the association was not detected with a lower amount of GSTα. If CK2α and CK2α′ have a different affinity for the hypothetical protein, this could cause the observed difference in their binding to Nopp140. One question that could be raised is whether α and α′ subunits exhibit redundancy in vertebrates as they do in yeast (5Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It is known that CK2α and CK2α′ are encoded by different genes (22Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and that they are structurally very homologous (85% homology) with major differences only in the COOH terminus (4Issinger O.-G. Pharmacol &. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the α subunit can act as a transcription factor to control β gene expression, whereas α′ cannot (37Pyerin W. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1994; 34: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Also, the α subunit phosphorylates the β subunit more efficiently than α′.3 It would be interesting to know whether the two catalytic subunits are associated with different proteins in the cell and have different functions. So far, a number of proteins have been found which interact with CK2, some with the catalytic α or α′ subunit, and some with the β subunit. For example, proteins that are reported to be able to interact with CK2α are the transcription factor ATF1 (38Wada T. Kakagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Kawase H. Hiramoto M. Ferdous A. Takayama M. Lee K.A.W. Hurst H.C. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 876-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), nucleolin (16Caizergues-Ferrer M. Belenguer P. Lapeyre B. Amalric F. Wallace M.O. Olson M.O.J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8123-8129Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Proteins that are shown to interact with CK2β are p53 (9Filhol O. Baudier J. Delphin C. Loue-Mackenbach P. Chambaz E.M.

https://openalex.org/W2019012996,"Tissue-type transglutaminases (TGases) were recently shown to exert dual enzymatic activities; they catalyze the posttranslational modification of proteins by transamidation, and they also act as guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase). Here we show that a tissue-type TGase is expressed in rat brain astrocytes in vitro, and is induced by the inflammation-associated cytokines interleukin-1beta and to a lesser extent by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Induction is accompanied by overexpression and appearance of an additional shorter clone, which does not contain the long 3'-untranslated region and encodes for a novel TGase enzyme whose C terminus lacks a site that affects the enzyme's interaction with guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Expression of two clones revealed that the long form is inhibited noncompetitively by GTP, but the short form significantly less so. The different affinities for GTP may account for the difference in physiological function between these two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1974069634,"Recent evidence indicates that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is up-regulated following brain injury and in neurodegenerative disorders such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. TNF-α elicits its biological effects through two distinct TNF receptor (TNFR) subtypes: p55 TNFR (TNFR1) and p75 TNFR (TNFR2). Studies have demonstrated that the p55 TNFR contributes to cell death, whereas the role of the p75 TNFR in neuronal viability is unclear. To better understand the role of p75 TNFR, we treated human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells with phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) for p75 TNFR and established that ASO inhibited p75 TNFR expression. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with ASO alone did not affect cell viability, whereas treatment with both ASO and human TNF-α significantly increased cell death relative to treatment with TNF-α alone. Moreover, addition of ASO significantly increased the level of cell injury observed following hypoxic conditions or exposure of β-amyloid peptide. These results indicate that inhibition of p75 TNFR using ASO increases the vulnerability of neurotypic cells to insults and suggest that the p75 TNFR may not be required for normal neuronal cell viability but rather plays a protective role following injury.

For example, TNF-α is toxic to human oligodendrocytes (9Louis J.-C. Magal E. Takayama S. Varon S. Science. 1993; 259: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and neuronal cells (10Chao C.C. Hu S. Dev.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Since TNF-α elicits its biological effects through activation of two distinct receptors, p55 TNFR and p75 TNFR, both of which have been cloned (13Loetscher H. Pan Y.-C.E. Lahm H-W. Gentz R.

Cell. 1990; 61: 361-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the distinct TNF receptor subtypes might contribute to the multiple biological functions of TNF-α. Reports indicate that the p55 TNFR may contribute to cell death (16Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar), whereas the role of the p75 TNFR in neuronal cell function is not clear. Here we show that inhibition of p75 TNFR by antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) increased the magnitude of neuronal cell death induced by TNF-α, hypoxic injury or β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. This novel finding provides evidence that the p75 TNFR might play a protective role following neuronal insult. tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor antisense oligonucleotide lactate dehydrogenase retinoic acid polymerase chain reaction human TNF β-amyloid peptide sense oligonucleotide reverse transcriptase. Human neuronal-like cells, SH-SY5Y, were cultured in a 1:1 ratio of minimum Eagle's medium/F-12 medium, 15% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 μM retinoic acid (RA, Sigma). The cells were seeded at 25,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate for cytotoxicity assays or 3 × 106 cells in Petri dishes for radioimmunoprecipitation study. The medium was replaced every 3 days. Treatments were given to the cells in serum-free medium with 1:100 N2-supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.) 50% minimum Eagle's medium and 50% F-12. The PCR technique was used to amplify cDNA derived from RNA extracted from RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells as described previously (17Shen Y. Halperin J.A. Lee C.-M. Brain Res. 1995; 671: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The PCR-forward oligonucleotide primer for p75 TNFR was 5′-GGTCACGCAACCTGTCTT-3′, and backward oligonucleotide primer for p75 TNFR was 5′-GGCTTCATCCCAGCATCA-3′. PCR-forward oligonucleotides primer for p55 TNFR was 5′-TCGATTTGCTGTACCAAGTG-3′, and backward oligonucleotides primer for p55 TNFR was 5′-GAAAATGACCAGGGGCAACAG-3′. After an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 5 min, the cycle was initiated, which consisted of denaturing for 1 min at 94°C, annealing for 2 min at 53°C, and extending for 2 min at 72°C. The cycle was repeated 35 times. Control reactions in the absence of RT with RNA template yielded no detectable product. A proportion (25%) of the reaction mixture was run in an agarose gel (1.2%). Both sense and antisense p75 TNFR oligonucleotide phosphorothioates were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 392 DNA synthesizer using phosphoramidite chemistry. Oligonucleotides were purified by reverse-phase chromatography using Oligo-Pak oligonucleotide purification columns (Milligen) as reported (18Agrawal S. Temsamani J. Tang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7595-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The p75 TNFR antisense oligonucleotide sequence was 5′-AGCACATCTGAGCTGTCT-3′ overlapping to the code for the initiation site of methionine on the human p75 TNFR gene (19Smith C.A. Davis T.

The p55 TNFR antisense oligonucleotide sequence was 5′-CCACCTCTCCGGGTACGG-3′ overlapping to the code for the initiation site of methionine on the human p55 TNFR gene (20Himmer A. Maurer-Fogy I.

The sense oligonucleotides for each receptor subtype were the exact inverse complement of the antisense oligonucleotides. Lyophilized oligonucleotides were dissolved in sterile water to prepare stock solutions, which were stored at −70°C until use. The cells were first transferred into a serum-free medium and then placed in a modular incubator containing 5% carbon dioxide and 95% nitrogen at 37°C. Following desired exposure (6 h), cultures were returned to a normoxic atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide and 95% room air at 37°C. Human tumor necrosis factor-α (R & D Systems) was aliquoted into 1 μg/ml of medium and then diluted into 20 ng/ml with serum-free N2 medium. Aβ-(1-42) was dissolved in dry Me2SO at 6.5 mM and then diluted with serum-free N2 medium. RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells (3 × 106) were cultured with the medium without methionine and cysteine for 2 h followed by incubation with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (50 μCi/ml, DuPont NEN) in methionine- and cysteine-free medium at 37°C. Fifteen hours later, cells were washed twice for 15 min each. Cell lysates were harvested and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min, incubated with p75 TNFR antibody (polyclonal detection antibody, R & D Systems, 1:500) for 16 h at 4°C, and precipitated with Staphylococcus protein A (Boehringer Mannheim). The immunoprecipitates were resolved in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 50% methanol solution and then incubated in Enlightning (DuPont) for 30 min with rocking. Bands in dried gels were detected by autoradiography. RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were cultured without fetal calf serum for 24 h. Cells were then lysed with deoxycholate (5 mg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.175 mg/ml), and aprotinin (100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml). The lysate was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Enprotech) 10-20% Tris/glycine gradient gel and then electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P (Millipore). Blots were saturated in a 5% nonfat dry milk phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 for 60 min at room temperature and then incubated with p55 TNFR antibody 1:1000 (polyclonal detection antibody, R & D Systems) for 60 min. After 3 washings with 0.1% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody 1:1000 (Amersham) was added to the blots for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the blots were washed with Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline and developed with the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham). For quantitative assessment of neuronal cell damage, the release of LDH from degenerating neurons was measured using a CytoTox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega) as described previously (17Shen Y. Halperin J.A. Lee C.-M. Brain Res. 1995; 671: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This biochemical index correlated with the morphological estimate. The percentage of LDH release was calculated as the portion of LDH in supernatant over total LDH from both supernatant and cell lysate. We used RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, considered to represent human neuronal-type cells, as our in vitro model. Results from RT-PCR demonstrated that both the p55 and p75 TNFRs were detected at the message level (Fig. 1) in RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. The sequences of two excised DNA bands of both TNFRs are identical to published ones (data not shown). Western blotting or immunoprecipitation studies have shown that these receptors were expressed at the protein level (Fig. 2a, p75 TNFR; Fig. 2b, p55 TNFR). These results are consistent with a report that another human neuronal-like cell line (SKNBE) expresses endogenous TNFRs (21Bradley J.R. Sathia T. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 27-32PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate a potential role of p75 TNFR in neuronal cell survival, we synthesized phosphorothioate-modified ASO for p75 TNFR in which the nucleotide sequence overlaps the code for the methionine initiation site on the human p75 TNFR gene (14Heller R.A. Song K. Fan N. Chang D.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We confirmed by immunoprecipitation that treatment of RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells with ASO (5-10 μM) directed at the p75 TNFR blocked expression of p75 TNFR (Fig. 2a, ASO-1 and ASO-2). Expression of p75 TNFR was almost completely inhibited by ASO at 10 μM (Fig. 2a, ASO-2) compared with that at 5 μM (Fig. 2a, ASO-1). Moreover, a number of studies were conducted to establish the specificity of the ASO treatment (22Sarin A. Conan-Cibotti M. Henkart P.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3716-3718PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chambaut-Guerin A.M. Matinez M.C. Hamimi C. Gauthereau X. Nunez J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Control experiments in RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells showed that expression of p75 TNFR protein was not affected in cells treated with hypoxia or Aβ-(1-42) alone, sense oligonucleotides (SO) alone, or co-treated with SO and hypoxia or Aβ-(1-42) (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, protein expression of the p55 TNFR was not affected in RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells following treatment with the p75-directed ASO (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2a, radioimmunoprecipitation of p75 TNFR and decreased p75 TNFR protein levels in RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y by antisense oligonucleotides for p75 TNFR.

No significant differences in LDH levels were detected following either ASO or SO for p75 TNFR treatment (10 μM) compared with the no treatment control (Fig. 3). Furthermore, no significant differences in LDH levels were observed in the cells treated with either ASO or SO for p55 TNFR treatment (10 μM) compared with the no treatment control (data not shown). Moreover, co-treatment of RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells with ASO for p75 TNFR (10 μM) and hTNF-α (20 ng/ml) produced significantly higher levels of LDH release compared to hTNF-α treatment alone (Fig. 3). Co-treatment with SO and hTNF-α did not affect the level of LDH release relative to hTNF-α treatment alone (Fig. 3). To support the findings that inhibition of p75 TNFR expression increases vulnerability of the cell to hTNF-α, we added anti-human p75 TNFR monoclonal neutralizing antibody into the cells to neutralize the biological activity of human p75 TNFR but not p55 TNFR (21Bradley J.R. Sathia T. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 27-32PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sarin A. Conan-Cibotti M. Henkart P.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3716-3718PubMed Google Scholar) and then treated the cells with hTNF-α (20 ng/ml). We found a similar increase in LDH release relative to that observed following treatment with ASO for p75 TNFR (Fig. 3). RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exposed to oxygen deprivation for 6 h displayed morphological changes, e.g. swollen cell bodies (data not shown), and produced increased levels of LDH release relative to controls (Fig. 3). Treatment of ASO for p75 TNFR during the 6 h of hypoxic exposure resulted in a significant increase in LDH release compared with hypoxia alone or treatment with SO under the identical hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3). We found a similar increase in LDH release from hypoxic cells treated with anti-human p75 TNFR antibody (Fig. 3). We also extended our studies by using Aβ-(1-42). Co-treatment of RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells with the ASO (10 μM) and Aβ (5 μM) produced significantly higher levels of LDH release compared with Aβ treatment alone (Fig. 4). Treatment of RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells with a combination of SO and Aβ did not affect the level of LDH release relative to Aβ treatment alone (Fig. 4). The observation that ASO directed for p75 TNFR does not alter cell viability despite inhibition of p75 TNFR protein expression suggested that p75 TNFR may not be required for normal neuronal functioning under basal conditions. Our data also demonstrated that inhibition of p75 TNFR using ASO increased vulnerability of neurotypic cells toward injury induced by hTNF-α, hypoxia, or Aβ. These results were further supported by similar results obtained using anti-human p75 TNFR-neutralizing antibody, suggesting that p75 TNFR may play a critical role in the ability of neurons to respond to insults. In addition, treating human neurotypic cells with ASO in vitro has proven to be a useful technique to suppress specific gene expression and to enable study of the functional significance of the corresponding protein (24Wagner R. Nature. 1994; 373: 333-335Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 25Retaux S. McNeill L. Harris W.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Neurons, akin to a number of other cell types, can express both p55 and p75 TNFRs (19Smith C.A. Davis T. Anderson D. Solam L. Beckmann M.P. Jerzy R. Dower S.K. Cosman D. Goodwin R.G.

Cytokine Netw. 1993; 4: 377-381PubMed Google Scholar); the genes for these receptors are located on human chromosomes 12 and 1, respectively. Based on amino acid sequencing, there is a 28% overall homology between p55 and p75 TNFRs. The amino acid sequences in the extracellular domains, transmembrane region, and intracellular domains between these two TNFR subtypes share 22, 28, and 10% homologies, respectively. The low level of homology suggests that distinct functions may be associated with each of these two receptors. Thus, TNF-α can elicit either a trophic or toxic response in neurons, which could be dependent on which TNF receptor subtype is activated. Recent studies indicate that the p55 TNFR is responsible for cell death signaling through activation of phospholipase A2 and NF-κB (28Miura M. Friedlander R.M. Yuan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8318-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Recent studies reported that knocking out both p55 and p75 TNF receptors increased neurodegeneration induced by ischemia in mouse brain (29Bruce A.J. Boling W. Kindy M.S. Peschon J. Kraemer P.J. Carpenter M.K. Holtsberg F.W. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1-7Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Our results are the first to indicate that the p75 TNFR may protect human neurons against insults, e.g. exposure to hypoxia or β-amyloid. Thus when a neuron is insulted, TNF-α may be released to activate the p75 TNFR (30Wieslander A.P. Nordin M.K. Martinson E. Kjellstrand P.T. Boberg U.C. Clin. Nephrol. 1993; 39: 343-348PubMed Google Scholar, 31Vesanen M. Wessman M. Salminen M. Vaheri A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1753-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which in turn may trigger a series of cellular events, e.g. secretion of trophic factors (32Scheil S. Ludecke G. Unsicker K. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 12: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), attenuation of calcium disruption, or free radical formation (12Cheng B. Christakos S. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), that enables the cell to defend itself against the insult. Therefore, p75 TNFR may be necessary for neuronal cell survival under pathological conditions following injury, and conditions that attenuate levels or functioning of the p75 TNFR may render cells more vulnerable to insult and disease. We thank Tom Kavanaugh for providing phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides and Richard Perner for providing Aβ-(1-42). We also appreciate very much Drs. Mike Williams, James Kerwin, and Art Hancock for their helpful discussion, critical comments, and support."

Liver-type arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) is an enzyme catalyzing the last step of the ornithine cycle (urea cycle), through which toxic ammonia is converted into less toxic urea. The mammalian arginase gene is expressed almost exclusively in the liver (1Herzfeld A. Raper S.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 2Kawamoto S. Amaya Y.

O'Brien W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After birth, arginase gene expression is also activated by high protein intake or starvation that imposes ammonia production (4Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 459-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1921-1924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These developmental and nutritional activations of the arginase gene are presumably mediated, at least in part, by glucocorticoids and/or glucagon. In fact, these hormones induce arginase mRNA in rat primary cultured hepatocytes (6Nebes V.L. Morris Jr., S.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and a rat hepatoma cell line H4IIE (7Dizikes G.J. Spector E.B. Cederbaum S.D. Somat. Cell Mol.

One is the primary response, in which the glucocorticoid-receptor complex directly activates transcription of target genes and which does not require ongoing protein synthesis. The other is the secondary response that follows a delayed time course, compared with the primary response, and is blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors. Genes showing the secondary response are exemplified by those of hepatic α2u-globulin (8Chen C.-L.C. Feigelson P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 349: 28-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), its isoform (9Addison W.R. Kurtz D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2334-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Hess P.

This induction in hepatocytes is caused by transcriptional activation of the C/EBPβ gene in a primary manner (30Matsuno F. Chowdhury S. Gotoh T. Iwase K. Matsuzaki H. Takatsuki K. Mori M.

CCAAT/enhancer binding protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase thymidine kinase gene maltose-binding protein. Here, we asked whether the C/EBP sites in the arginase enhancer mediate the glucocorticoid response. We also examined changes in profiles of protein binding to these sites in response to glucocorticoids. Our findings suggest that C/EBPβ is involved in the secondary glucocorticoid response of the arginase gene. The basal chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid pBLCAT5-ABA was constructed starting from the plasmid pBLCAT5 (31Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schütz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) that harbors the CAT gene under the control of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (tk) promoter. pBLCAT5 was cut with BglII, blunt-ended with Klenow fragment, and self-ligated. The resulting plasmid was cut with SacI, and the linker 5′-CGGGCCCAGATCTGGGCCCGAGCT-3′ bearing the ApaI-BglII-ApaI sites was inserted into the SacI site, yielding the plasmid pBLCAT5-ABA. Oligonucleotides each containing C/EBP binding sites A and B (previously designated protein-binding sites I and III (12Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem.

The direction and sequence integrity of the inserts were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Rat hepatoma H4IIE cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection was carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar), with a total of 15 μg of DNA mixture containing 10 μg of the CAT gene recombinant plasmid and 5 μg of an internal standard plasmid pAc-lacZ (33Miyazaki J. Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) bearing the β-galactosidase gene. Cells were cultured with or without 1 μM dexamethasone for 48 h prior to harvesting. During this period, 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP was also added into the medium to increase the basal CAT activity (12Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem.

IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar), quantified using a bio-image analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo), and normalized for β-galactosidase activity. Relative CAT activities were shown by mean values plus standard errors of at least three independent experiments. Nuclear extracts from rat liver (35Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. The probe used was the 32P-labeled DNA fragment corresponding to the lower strand of the XbaI-HincII enhancer segment (12Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The binding reaction, DNase I digestion, and electrophoresis were done as described previously (12Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the recombinant C/EBPβ protein fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) was as described (13Chowdhury S. Gotoh T. Mori M. Takiguchi M. Eur. J.

The binding reaction for 30 min on ice was carried out as described previously (12Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem.

The antibodies used in supershift/inhibition analysis (1 μg of IgG in 1 μl) against C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Isolation of total RNA (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar), electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization (30Matsuno F. Chowdhury S. Gotoh T. Iwase K. Matsuzaki H. Takatsuki K. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were performed as described. The following 32P-labeled DNA probes were used: the mouse C/EBPβ gene, about a 1.6-kilobase BstXI fragment of pEF-C/EBPβ (22Nishiyori A. Tashiro H. Kimura A. Akagi K. Yamamura K. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1323-1331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); rat arginase cDNA, about a 850-base pair EcoRI-EcoRV fragment of pARGr-2 (38Kawamoto S. Amaya Y. Murakami K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Kobayashi K. Saheki T. Kimura S. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6280-6283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and rat β actin, a polymerase chain reaction product, nucleotide positions 417-1223 (39Nudel U. Zakut R. Shani M. Neuman S. Levy Z. Yaffe D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Relative mRNA levels quantified with a bio-image analyzer were shown by mean values with standard errors of at least three independent experiments. The arginase enhancer, which shows glucocorticoid responsiveness in a delayed secondary manner, contains four protein binding sites (12Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two sites (sites A and B) bind C/EBP family members (Fig. 1). To examine the contribution of the two C/EBP binding sites to glucocorticoid responsiveness, we inserted each C/EBP binding site just in front of the herpes simplex virus tk promoter that drives the Escherichia coli CAT gene, and transient transfection assay was done using rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. The cells were treated with 1 μM dexamethasone for 48 h, and cell extracts were subjected to CAT enzyme assay (Fig. 1). CAT activity derived from the native tk promoter was increased slightly (1.8-fold) by the dexamethasone treatment. When site A was inserted in the same direction of the tk promoter, CAT activity was enhanced 13.6-fold in the absence of dexamethasone and was not further augmented by dexamethasone. On the other hand, when inserted in the opposite direction, site A enhanced basal CAT activity 4.4-fold, and this enhanced activity was further stimulated 7.8-fold by dexamethasone. Therefore, site A can respond to dexamethasone if appropriately arranged with the tk promoter. The reason why site A does not respond to dexamethasone in the forward direction is not known. A possible explanation is that in this promoter construct an unidentified transcriptional activator(s) occupies site A and is insensitive to dexamethasone. Another C/EBP binding site B had little effect on basal CAT activity when a single copy of this site was inserted in forward or reverse direction. On the other hand, CAT activities derived from these constructs increased 5.3- and 3.9-fold, respectively, in response to dexamethasone. Two copies of site B inserted in the forward direction led to a 5.3-fold increase in the basal tk promoter activity, which was further augmented 4.2-fold by dexamethasone. Therefore, site B exhibits glucocorticoid responsiveness in the context of the tk promoter. Thus, both C/EBP binding sites A and B have potency to mediate the glucocorticoid response. To examine whether dexamethasone affects protein-binding profiles of the C/EBP sites, DNase I footprint analysis was carried out (Fig. 2). Using nuclear extracts from H4IIE cells, protection against DNase I digestion was observed at C/EBP sites A and B corresponding to footprint areas previously detected with rat liver nuclear extracts (12Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Treatment of H4IIE cells with 1 μM dexamethasone for 12 h changed the footprint profiles of both sites A and B. In both sites, the footprint profiles obtained with extracts from dexamethasone-treated cells resembled those seen with liver extracts. Therefore, binding activity (or activities) to C/EBP sites A and B similar to that in the liver seems to be induced in H4IIE cells by dexamethasone. We further characterized dexamethasone-induced changes in a factor(s) binding to sites A and B with gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 3A). We previously showed that C/EBPα and C/EBPβ bind with these sites and that C/EBPα dominates in the rat liver, whereas C/EBPβ dominates in the dexamethasone-treated H4IIE cells (12Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When H4IIE cells were treated with 1 μM dexamethasone for 12 h, binding of nuclear extracts to sites A and B was dramatically enhanced (compare lanes 5 to lanes 1). To examine whether C/EBPβ is involved in dexamethasone-induced binding activities, antibody supershift/inhibition analysis was performed. The antibody specific to C/EBPβ diminished the complexes induced by dexamethasone (lanes 7), while the C/EBPα-specific antibody and the control serum caused little change (lanes 6 and 8). Therefore, C/EBPβ accounts for a major portion of site A- and B-binding activities induced by dexamethasone in H4IIE cells. Similar results were obtained by using as a probe the authentic C/EBP site (40Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (data not shown). To confirm recognition of sites A and B by C/EBPβ, we examined binding of the recombinant C/EBPβ protein fused to MBP (Fig. 3B). When sites A and B, as well as the authentic Rous sarcoma virus C/EBP site, were used as probes, the MBP-C/EBPβ fusion protein but not MBP gave a shifted band. On the other hand, no shifted band was detected when an unrelated probe (site IV (12Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) of the arginase enhancer) was used. Thus, sites A and B specifically bind with the recombinant C/EBPβ protein. All these results taken together lead to the proposal that binding activity for C/EBP sites A and B of the arginase enhancer is induced in H4IIE cells by dexamethasone administration and that this binding can be attributable to C/EBPβ. Based on the observations described above and the primary glucocorticoid response of the C/EBPβ gene (30Matsuno F. Chowdhury S. Gotoh T. Iwase K. Matsuzaki H. Takatsuki K. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the secondary response of the arginase gene (6Nebes V.L. Morris Jr., S.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that C/EBPβ induced primarily by dexamethasone is responsible for the secondary induction of the arginase gene. We then examined whether time courses for increases in C/EBPβ mRNA level, C/EBP site-binding activity, and arginase mRNA level by dexamethasone are concordant with this hypothesis. In Fig. 4A, RNA blot analysis was carried out after exposure of H4IIE cells to dexamethasone for various periods. Arginase mRNA began to increase with a lag of 6 h following the hormone addition and increased markedly at 24 h. On the other hand, C/EBPβ mRNA began to increase as early as 0.5 h and reached a plateau at 2 h. β actin mRNA, measured as a standard, was practically unchanged. Time courses of changes in binding activities for C/EBP sites A and B were also monitored (Fig. 4B). For both sites A and B, binding activities were increased markedly 6 h after the addition of dexamethasone and were sustained by 24 h. No obvious change was observed for NF-I site-binding activity monitored as a standard. These results were quantified in Fig. 4C Concordant with our hypothesis, the increase in arginase mRNA was preceded by the increases in C/EBP site-binding activities, which were further preceded by the increase in C/EBPβ mRNA. In this report, we presented evidence supporting the notion that C/EBPβ mediates the secondary glucocorticoid response of the arginase gene. First, C/EBP sites of the arginase enhancer, when linked to the heterologous tk promoter, exhibited glucocorticoid responsiveness in reporter transfection assay. Second, protein binding profiles of these C/EBP sites were changed by dexamethasone, and C/EBPβ occupied the major portion of newly induced binding activities. Third, induction of arginase mRNA by dexamethasone followed an increase in C/EBP site-binding activity that was preceded by C/EBPβ mRNA induction. We previously showed that C/EBPβ mRNA is induced by dexamethasone through transcriptional activation without requiring de novo protein synthesis (30Matsuno F. Chowdhury S. Gotoh T. Iwase K. Matsuzaki H. Takatsuki K. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the induction of arginase mRNA follows a delayed time course and requires ongoing protein synthesis (6Nebes V.L. Morris Jr., S.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Matsuno F. Chowdhury S. Gotoh T. Iwase K. Matsuzaki H. Takatsuki K. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we propose the following: glucocorticoids primarily activate the C/EBPβ gene and the induced C/EBPβ secondarily activates the arginase gene by binding to the enhancer region. In cotransfection assay using non-hepatic Chinese hamster ovary cells, CAT activity derived from the reporter construct containing one copy of site B in the forward direction was activated weakly (1.7-fold) by a C/EBPβ expression plasmid. 2T. Gotoh, S. Chowdhury, M. Takiguchi, and M. Mori, unpublished results. It remains to be clarified whether an additional factor(s) is required for the maximal action of dexamethasone. In general, gene cascades controlled by steroid hormones underlie various biological processes. A well documented example is effects of ecdysone in metamorphosis of Drosophila Ecdysone triggers induction of a relatively small number of primary response genes, some of which encode transcription factors. These induced factors in turn activate more than 100 secondary response genes (reviewed in Ref. 41Thummel C.S. Cell. 1995; 83: 871-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In mammals, several transcription factors, as well as C/EBPβ, were shown to be primarily induced by glucocorticoids in various tissues: C/EBPδ in adipocytes (42MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Lin F.-T.

https://openalex.org/W2050428089,"Integrin-mediated cell adhesion triggers intracellular signaling cascades, including tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. We show in this report that p120cbl (Cbl), the 120-kDa c-cbl proto-oncogene product, becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during integrin-mediated macrophage cell adhesion to extracellular matrix substrata and anti-integrin antibodies. This tyrosine phosphorylation does not occur when cells attach to polylysine, to which cells adhere in a nonspecific fashion. It also does not take place when adhesion-induced reorganization of the cytoskeleton is inhibited with cytochalasin D. In contrast to the rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl by CSF-1 stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl by cell attachment was gradual and persistent. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl was found to form complexes with the SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins Src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that these kinases were active in the Cbl complexes following integrin ligand binding. Furthermore, Cbl was found to translocate to the plasma membrane in response to cell adhesion to fibronectin. These observations suggest that Cbl serves as a docking protein and may transduce signals to downstream signaling pathways following integrin-mediated cell adhesion in macrophages. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion triggers intracellular signaling cascades, including tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. We show in this report that p120cbl (Cbl), the 120-kDa c-cbl proto-oncogene product, becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during integrin-mediated macrophage cell adhesion to extracellular matrix substrata and anti-integrin antibodies. This tyrosine phosphorylation does not occur when cells attach to polylysine, to which cells adhere in a nonspecific fashion. It also does not take place when adhesion-induced reorganization of the cytoskeleton is inhibited with cytochalasin D. In contrast to the rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl by CSF-1 stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl by cell attachment was gradual and persistent. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl was found to form complexes with the SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins Src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that these kinases were active in the Cbl complexes following integrin ligand binding. Furthermore, Cbl was found to translocate to the plasma membrane in response to cell adhesion to fibronectin. These observations suggest that Cbl serves as a docking protein and may transduce signals to downstream signaling pathways following integrin-mediated cell adhesion in macrophages.

Integrins compose the major class of receptors used by cells to interact with ECM proteins (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). The integrin family currently consists of over 20 distinct α/β heterodimeric transmembrane receptors, with the combination of a particular α and β subunit determining the ligand specificity (3Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, integrins form clusters on the cell surface; this clustering takes place at cellular sites termed focal adhesions and leads to the assembly of intracellular multiprotein complexes associated with the actin cytoskeleton (4Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions are thought to act not only as structural links between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton, but also as sites of signal transduction from the ECM; engagement of cell-surface integrins is associated with a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several focal adhesion proteins. In fibroblasts, these proteins include the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (for a review, see Ref. 5Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar), paxillin (6Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J.

In this report, we have studied the tyrosine phosphorylation events taking place during integrin-mediated cell adhesion in macrophages. In myeloid cells, adherence to ECM components or ligation of integrins with antibodies results in a rapid induction of multiple inflammatory mediator genes, cytokines, and collagenases and in a modulation of the proliferative capacity and the phagocytic activity of these cells (for reviews, see Refs. 26Mondal K.

Today. 1991; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In parallel to these events, monocyte/macrophage cell adhesion to ECM proteins is accompanied by a rapid increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation (29Lin T.H. Yurochko A. Kornberg L. Morris J. Walker J.J. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1585-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); the protein-tyrosine kinase Syk (30Lin T.H. Rosales C. Mondal K. Bolen J.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11016-11022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have recently been identified to be among these proteins. FAK, although important in integrin signaling in many other cell types, including fibroblasts, may not play a crucial role in macrophages, as it is absent or expressed at low levels in these cells (29Lin T.H. Yurochko A. Kornberg L. Morris J. Walker J.J. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1585-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31De Nichilo M.O. Yamada K.M. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 5747-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, we found in this study that integrin ligand binding does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in mouse macrophages. A profound increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with apparent molecular masses of 120-130 kDa, however, accompanied integrin-mediated cell adhesion. We sought to determine whether p120cbl (Cbl) might be among the 120-130-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Cbl, which was originally identified as the cellular homolog of the Cas NS-1 murine leukemia retroviral oncogene v-cbl, is a novel signaling molecule primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells. Cbl lacks any obvious catalytic domains, but it possesses multiple potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites and proline-rich motifs, which could mediate concurrent association with SH2 and SH3 domain-containing polypeptides, respectively. Cbl also has a carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper, a motif known to promote homo- and heterodimerization of other proteins (for a review, see Ref. 33Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, Cbl is well suited for a potential role in assembling intracellular signaling complexes. More important, Cbl has been shown to be abundant in macrophages (34Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Tanaka S. Neff L. Baron R. Levy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14347-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and was recently identified as a major tyrosine kinase substrate following CSF-1 stimulation or engagement of Fcγ receptors in these cells (35Tanaka S. Neff L. Baron R. Levy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14347-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar–37Marcilla A. Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Agarwal A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9115-9120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We report here that Cbl is a predominant phosphorylated component in macrophages upon cell adhesion and forms complexes with SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules, such as Src and PI 3-kinase. Thus, protein-protein interactions mediated by Cbl may connect integrin signaling to downstream signaling pathways in macrophages.

All other reagents were acquired from Sigma. The mouse macrophage cell lines IC-21, P388D1, and RAW 264.7 were from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For the experiments, cells were grown to 90% confluency as monolayers and scraped off the dish with a cell scraper. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and cell suspensions were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium and 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 20 min on a rotator. Cells were then plated onto dishes coated with various substrates and incubated at 37°C for the indicated × cells referred to as suspended cells under “Results” were held in suspension for an additional 20 min. In some experiments, the indicated amounts of cytochalasin D were added 10 min prior to plating the cells, and cells were allowed to adhere to fibronectin for 40 min. Dishes were coated with fibronectin (20 μg/ml), vitronectin (20 μg/ml), affinity-purified anti-α5β1 antibody (10 μg/ml), affinity-purified anti-αvβ3 antibody (10 μg/ml), monoclonal anti-major histocompatibility complex antibody (10 μg/ml), or polylysine (20 μg/ml) overnight and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h prior to plating the cells. Cell stimulation with 25 nM CSF-1 for the indicated times was carried out as described (36Wang Y. Yeung Y.-G. Langdon W.Y. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 unit/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml pepstatin A). Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM EDTA, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described above) was used in experiments where in vitro kinase assays were carried out, and Nonidet P-40/Triton X-100 buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 145 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors) was used for PI 3-kinase assays. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblot analysis were carried out as described earlier (10Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 40Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In vitro association experiments were done with GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domains of Crk, PI 3-kinase (this construct contains the amino-terminal SH2 domain of PI 3-kinase) (41Jhun B.H. Rose D.W. Seely B.L. Rameh L. Cantley L. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7466-7475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Shc (42Sasaoka T. Rose D.W. Jhun B.H. Saltiel A.R. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13689-13694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Src and the SH3 domains of Crk, PI 3-kinase, and Src. The GST-SH2 domain of Crk was from Dr. Michiyuki Matsuda, and the GST-SH2 domain of Src was from Dr. Hisamaru Hirai (University of Tokyo, Tokyo). The GST-SH3 domains of Crk, PI 3-kinase, and Src were from Dr. Stephen Taylor (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The binding and blotting experiments were carried out as described (11Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro tyrosine kinase assays, Cbl was immunoprecipitated from suspended or adherent cells in Nonidet P-40 buffer as described above. Immunoprecipitates were incubated at 25°C for 30 min in kinase assay buffer (50 mM Pipes, pH 7.0, 10 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN). Where indicated, reactions were carried out in the presence of 5 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Sigma). The precipitates were then boiled in sample buffer and electrophoresed on 4-12% precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex, Encinitas, CA). Following electrophoresis, gels were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis in 1 M KOH, after which tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. Relative amounts of Cbl were determined by immunoblot analysis with the anti-Cbl antibodies of equal aliquots of the unlabeled immunoprecipitates. In some of the experiments, the immunocomplex proteins were released after the kinase assay by boiling in 0.5% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, and 10 mM dithiothreitol. The supernatant was then diluted 10-fold in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with the anti-Cbl and anti-Src antibodies; the reprecipitates were analyzed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. Quantitation was performed with an AMBIS radioanalytic imaging system. For PI 3-kinase activity assays, IC-21 cells were either kept in suspension or plated on fibronectin or on anti-integrin antibodies for 20 or 40 min or onto polylysine for 40 min. Where indicated, cells cultured as a monolayer were stimulated with CSF-1 (25 nM) for the indicated times prior the lysis. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40/Triton X-100 buffer, and immunoprecipitations with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, anti-Cbl antibody, and a control unrelated antibody were carried out as described above. The PI 3-kinase activity of the immunocomplexes was assayed according to Whitman et al. (43Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Hypotonic lysis and fractionation were performed as described (44Hartley D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21939-21943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, IC-21 cells adhering either to polylysine or to fibronectin for 40 min were incubated on ice in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described above) for 10 min and then scraped off and homogenized in a glass homogenizer. 0.25 volume of buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 600 mM NaCl was added to the homogenate, after which the nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min. EDTA was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 5 mM before spinning at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The resulting supernatant constituted the “cytosolic fraction.” The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant from this step was termed the “membrane fraction.” To investigate tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in response to cell adhesion, the mouse macrophage cell lines IC-21, P388D1, and RAW 264.7 were either kept in suspension or plated onto dishes coated with fibronectin for 45 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel, lanes 1 and 2), cell adhesion to fibronectin resulted in elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 150-170, 115-135, and 70-85 kDa. The three macrophage cell lines were used throughout the study, and similar results were obtained. Unless otherwise indicated, the results shown in the figures are those obtained with IC-21 cells. We tested the possibility that one of the phosphorylated proteins in the 115-135-kDa range would be FAK. FAK was only barely detectable in anti-FAK immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates and anti-FAK immunoprecipitates prepared from P388D1 cells and appeared to be completely absent in RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). FAK protein was expressed in IC-21 cells at an estimated level of 10% of that in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts; no tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK could be detected in either suspended or adherent IC-21 cells (lanes 10 and 11). FAK immunoprecipitated from suspended or adherent cells did not exhibit any kinase activity in an in vitro kinase assay (data not shown). One of the phosphorylated 75-85-kDa proteins in all cell lines was identified as paxillin, as demonstrated previously (data not shown and Ref. 31De Nichilo M.O. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11016-11022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that Cbl, the product of the c-cbl proto-oncogene (33Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), would be among the unidentified phosphoproteins in the 115-135-kDa range, samples from suspended and adherent IC-21 cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Cbl and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1). When immunoprecipitated from suspended cells, Cbl exhibited a very low level of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1, upper panel, lane 3). An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl was seen in cells plated on fibronectin, vitronectin, or anti-α5β1 or anti-αvβ3 antibodies (lanes 4-7). Cell adhesion to polylysine, to which cells can adhere in a nonspecific fashion, had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl (lane 8). Similarly, no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed when cells were allowed to adhere to dishes coated with anti-major histocompatibility complex antibodies (lane 9). The amount of Cbl was essentially the same in all samples, as shown when the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-Cbl antibody (Fig. 1, lower panel). The phosphorylation of FAK, p130cas, paxillin, and tensin in fibroblasts has been shown to coincide with cell adhesion, with maximal phosphorylation occurring around the time of cell spreading and actin filament reorganization (6Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 7Bockholt S.M. Burridge K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To study the connection of Cbl phosphorylation with actin filament reorganization, IC-21 cells were allowed to adhere to fibronectin-coated dishes, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl was assessed as a function of time (Fig. 2A). At time 0, Cbl contained little phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl was detectable after 10 min of adhesion. After 20 min, a clear increase in Cbl phosphorylation was observed in cells plated on fibronectin; at this time point, most of the cells had adhered to fibronectin, but had not yet fully obtained a flat, spread morphology. Maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl occurred at 40 min after plating, when macrophages appeared maximally spread on fibronectin. After 90 min, phosphorylation slowly declined and remained unchanged after 5 h (300 min) of plating under serum-free conditions. To determine whether reorganization of the cytoskeleton is necessary for cell adherence to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl, the spreading of cells plated onto a fibronectin substratum was inhibited with cytochalasin D; cytochalasin D treatment has been shown to prevent integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas, FAK, and tensin (7Bockholt S.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14565-14567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Cytochalasin D prevented cell spreading and tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in a dose-dependent manner. At a cytochalasin D concentration of 0.05 μM, no effect was observed on cell spreading or on tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl (Fig. 2A, right panels). Cytochalasin D at a concentration of 0.25 μM clearly decreased the integrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl; this decrease correlated with the inhibition of cell spreading. A complete inhibition of both cell spreading and adhesion-induced Cbl phosphorylation was observed when cells were treated with 1.0 μM cytochalasin D. In contrast to the gradual and persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl observed above during cell adhesion to fibronectin, CSF-1 stimulation has earlier been shown to result in a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in macrophages (36Wang Y.

Indeed, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates from cell lysates prepared at various times after CSF-1 stimulation of IC-21 cells showed that Cbl is rapidly and transiently (peak at 1-3 min) tyrosine-phosphorylated. Cytochalasin D treatment did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl following CSF-1 stimulation (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that both integrin- and growth factor-mediated signaling pathways stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in macrophages and that these pathways appear to be mechanistically different. The tyrosine-phosphorylated sites in Cbl may function as binding sites for proteins containing SH2 domains, as is the case with the other integrin-regulated proteins, p130cas, FAK, and paxillin (see the Introduction). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl has been described in response to receptor occupancy of a limited number of receptors in hematopoietic cells; in these systems, phosphorylated Cbl has been shown to interact with signaling molecules by binding their SH2 domains (see “Discussion”). To test whether SH2-containing proteins would bind to Cbl in an adhesion-dependent manner, binding experiments with various GST-SH2 fusion proteins were conducted. As shown in Fig. 3A, the SH2 domains of several signaling proteins bound to Cbl in lysates of IC-21 cells that had been plated on fibronectin for 40 min. No SH2 domain binding to Cbl was seen in cell lysates prepared from suspended cells or from cells plated on polylysine. Among the signaling molecules found to interact with Cbl in a manner dependent on integrin ligand binding were Crk, PI 3-kinase, and Src. No interaction was detected between Cbl and the SH2 domain of Shc. It has been demonstrated previously that the SH3 domains of a limited number of signaling molecules can bind proline-rich regions of Cbl; these proteins include members of the Src family kinases (37Marcilla A.

COX-2 is known to be induced by cytokines and the skin tumor promoter 12-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-myristate (TPA). In the present study, we investigated the effects of several non-TPA-type tumor promoters on COX-2 expression in immortalized mouse liver cells. Specifically, we tested peroxisome proliferators (PPs), which are rodent liver tumor promoters that cause gross alterations in cellular lipid metabolism, the rodent liver tumor promoter phenobarbital, and the skin tumor promoters okadaic acid and thapsigargin. The PPs Wy-14643, mono-ethylhexyl phthalate, clofibrate, ciprofibrate ethyl ester, and eicosatetraynoic acid each caused large increases in COX-2 mRNA and protein, with maximal expression seen approximately 10 h after treatment of quiescent cells. COX-2 expression was also induced by thapsigargin, okadaic acid, and calcium ionophore A23187, but not by phenobarbital or the steroid PP dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Induction of COX-2 expression generally resulted in increased synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). However, the PPs caused little or no increase in PGE2 levels, and they inhibited serum-induced PGE2 synthesis. Unlike non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the PPs do not directly inhibit cyclooxygenase enzyme activity in vitro Thus, PPs regulate prostaglandin metabolism via both positive (COX-2 induction) and inhibitory mechanisms. In summary, the strong induction of COX-2 expression by PPs, thapsigargin, and okadaic acid suggests a possible role for COX-2 in the growth regulatory activity of these non-TPA-type tumor promoters.

NEM, however, induces Ca2+ release with a slower onset than the heavy metals, a finding that has been interpreted to mean that the sulfhydryls responsible for the observed effects on Ca2+ release are in a hydrophilic environment (9Abramson J.J.

The reaction occurs only when the channel is in the open state. These compounds reduce the conductance in multiple steps until complete closure of the channel is obtained, suggesting a reactive sulfhydryl in the ion conducting pathway. The multiple effects of sulfhydryl reagents on the activity of the Ca2+ release channel raise the question of whether all of these reagents are reacting with the same sulfhydryls or whether alteration of multiple classes of sulfhydryls can alter the function of the channel.

Additional information about the location of the cross-links is obtained using a membrane preparation that has both the full-length 565-kDa subunit and the 400-kDa fragment generated by the action of endogenous calpain. [3H]Ryanodine (61.5 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Ryanodine was obtained from Calbiochem. Diamide (15Reid M.B. Haack K.E. Franchek K.M. Valberg P.A. Kobzik L. West M.S. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 73: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), NEM, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were obtained from Sigma. Phosphatidylethanolamine (bovine heart) and phosphatidylcholine (bovine brain) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc (Alabaster, AL). Ultima Gold scintillant was purchased from Packard (Meriden, CT). SR membranes were prepared from rabbit backstrap and hindleg skeletal muscle and were purified by using sucrose gradient centrifugation as described elsewhere (30Hamilton S.L. Tate C.H. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 313-343Google Scholar, 31Rosemblatt M. Hidalgo C. Vergara C. Ikemoto N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using BSA as standard. For binding experiments, membranes in buffer I (300 mM NaCl, 100 μM CaCl2, 50 mM MOPS (pH7.4)) were incubated with 100 to 500 μM diamide for 30 min at 4°C or for 10 min at room temperature. Diamide was removed either by dilution (10-fold) or by pelleting and washing the membranes in a Beckman Airfuge by centrifuging 4 min at 30 p.s.i. For bilayer experiments the sample was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 500 μM diamide in buffer II (225 mM CsSO3CH3, 10 μM CaCl2, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4). Membranes cross-linked in buffer I or II were washed and assayed for [3H]ryanodine binding and for changes in gel patterns by SDS-PAGE. All [3H]ryanodine binding assays were done in buffer I. SR membranes (20-40 μg) were cross-linked with diamide for 10 min at room temperature (23°C) or 30 min on ice. The samples were treated with 5 mM NEM for 20 min at room temperature before solubilization in sample buffer. Electrophoresis on 5% SDS-PAGE was performed for the first dimension. Electrophoresis was continued for 15 min after the dye front ran off gel. The lanes were excised and used for second dimension electrophoresis. The excised gel strips were treated with 50 mM DTT in sample buffer without SDS and bromphenol blue for 60 min at room temperature (23°C). The gel strips were loaded on the second dimension gel (5% SDS-PAGE). The gap was sealed with melted agarose (1% agarose, 2% SDS, 50 mM DTT). After electrophoresis, the second dimension gel was silver-stained. Membranes (6 mg/ml) were incubated with 1 mM [14C]NEM (lot 3120256, 40 mCi/mmol, 2.5 mM) for the times indicated in Fig. 9. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mM DTT and the samples were electrophoresed on 5% SDS gels. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the 565-kDa band was excised, dried, and rehydrated in 100 μl of H2O, digested with 7.5% TS-2 tissue solubilizer (Beckman) in 4 ml of nonaqueous scintillant (2.8 g/liter diphenyloxazole, 0.28 g/liter p-bis-[2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)]benzene in toluene). Samples were shaken for 8 h and counted after 48 h. [3H]Ryanodine was incubated overnight (15-17 h) at room temperature (23°C) with 5-75 μg of SR membranes in 100-250 μl of buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl, 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.40), 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.1% CHAPS, 100 μM CaCl2, 100 μM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 200 μM aminobenzamidine, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of either 10 μM or 100 μM ryanodine. Bound [3H]ryanodine was separated from free by rapid filtration of the sample through Whatman GF/F glass fiber filters followed by five 3-ml washes with ice-cold wash buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl, 100 μM CaCl2, and 10 mM MOPS (pH 7.4). The radioactivity bound to the filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting of the filters in 5 ml of Ultima Gold scintillant. Planar bilayers consisting of 8:2 L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine and L-α-phosphatidylcholine were formed following the Mueller-Rudin procedure across a 100-μm diameter aperture in Teflon cups as described previously (34Hamilton S.L. Mejia Alvarez R. Fill M. Hawkes J. Brush K.L. Schilling W.P. Stefani E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mixture of phospholipids was dissolved in n-decane (Sigma) at a concentration of 50 mg/ml. Both chambers were filled with buffer solution (20 mM CsSO3CH3, 10 μM CaCl2, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4). After bilayer formation, 5 μl of SR membranes were added to the cis chamber to give a final protein concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. The other side of the bilayer was defined as trans and is the ground. An osmotic gradient was formed between the cis and trans chambers by adding a concentrated salt solution (4 M CsSO3CH3, 10 μM CaCl2, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4) to the cis chamber. Recording solutions contained 225 mM CsSO3CH3 in both the cis and trans chambers. All additions were made to the cis chamber. Agar/KCl bridges were used to connect the chambers to Ag/AgCl electrodes immersed in 2 M KCl. The holding potential was +40 mV. The data were filtered at 2.5 KHz and digitized at 10 KHz. [3H]Ryanodine binding data were analyzed with nonlinear curve fitting using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Nonspecific binding was subtracted prior to analysis. Single-channel recordings were analyzed using FETCHAN and pSTAT software (Axon Instruments, Inc). Steady-state open probabilities (Po) were determined by measuring the fraction of time that the channel is open in at least 2 min of recording. Instantaneous open probabilities were determined as the fraction that the channel was open in 10 s of recording. NEM is an alkylating reagent, which reacts primarily with cysteine residues (35Gregory J.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77Google Scholar). The effect of NEM alkylation on the activity of the Ca2+ release channel reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers is shown in Fig. 1A Immediately after the addition of NEM, the channel was inhibited (phase 1). Continued exposure to the alkylating agent (3-10 min) produced a substantial activation (phase 2), but longer incubations led again to inhibition of channel activity (phase 3). This stepwise effect of NEM is shown in Fig. 1B in the plot of Po values as a function of time after the addition of 5 mM NEM. To investigate the phase 1 inhibition, we examined the effect of 200 μM NEM on the activity of the channel in the bilayer (Fig. 1C). Only the phase 1 inhibition was seen with 200 μM NEM, but the subsequent addition of 5 mM NEM led to channel activation. These effects of stepwise addition of NEM on Po values are summarized in Fig. 1D NEM also has time-dependent effects on [3H]ryanodine binding. The effect of reaction of the membranes with 5 mM NEM is shown in Fig. 2A For binding experiments, NEM was reacted in binding buffer at 4°C and the alkylation was stopped by the addition of 10 mM DTT. Similar to the effects on channel activity, there were three distinct phases of the alkylation that altered [3H]ryanodine binding. The three phases are an initial and rapid inhibition (phase 1), a recovery or enhancement of binding (phase 2), and a second inhibitory step (phase 3). The phase 1 decrease with 5 mM NEM reaches 49.1 ± 4.4% (n = 3) inhibition prior to the onset of phase 2. The time course of these three phases was dependent on the concentration of NEM (Fig. 2B). Lower concentrations of NEM (500 μM) slow the onset of phases 2 and 3, allowing phase 1 to plateau at 54.6 ± 5.7% (n = 4) inhibition. If the sulfhydryls that have reacted at 500 μM NEM are primarily phase 1 sulfhydryls, it should be possible to add 5 mM NEM to membranes at the plateau stage and recover the phase 2 enhancement of [3H]ryanodine binding. This experiment is shown in Fig. 2C The addition of 5 mM NEM 25 min after the 500 μM NEM addition gave rise to the recovery of binding (phase 2) followed by phase 3 inhibition. The reaction with NEM under bilayer conditions was faster than that obtained using the protocol employed for Fig. 2 (A-C). For comparison, the effect on [3H]ryanodine binding of the reaction of membranes with 500 μM and 5 mM NEM in bilayer buffer and at room temperature is shown in Fig. 2D The three phases were still seen, and the time of onset of each phase corresponded to those observed in the bilayer; however, the extent of inhibition was always less under bilayer conditions, possibly reflecting the difference in the redox state of the channel under these conditions. All membrane preparations that we tested showed the three-phase effect of NEM. Some variation in the magnitude of the three phases was, however, observed. Some air oxidation of sulfhydryls did occur, and the difference in the three phases may reflect differences in the oxidation state of the membranes. The sulfhydryl oxidizing agent, diamide, can also activate the channel reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers (Fig. 3). This activation was reversed by the addition of 5 mM DTT. The Po of the channel was increased from 0.035 ± 0.007 (n = 3) to 0.132 ± 0.030 (n = 3) in the presence of 250 μM diamide. Subsequent treatment with DTT decreases the Po to 0.022 ± 0.006 (n = 3). Treatment of membranes with diamide caused an alteration in the electrophoretic mobility of the 565-kDa subunit of the Ca2+ release channel. In diamide cross-linking experiments with either membranes (Fig. 4A) or purified Ca2+ release channel, 3Y. Wu, B. Aghdasi, S. J. Dou, and S. L. Hamilton, submitted for publication. the 565-kDa band disappeared and a new band was seen with an electrophoretic mobility consistent with dimer formation. Approximate molecular mass values of the oligomers were determined using a 200-kDa myosin standard and the full-length ryanodine-binding protein as a 565-kDa standard. Higher concentrations of diamide produced higher oligomers of the 565-kDa standard, which did not enter the gel. To demonstrate that the high molecular weight bands generated by diamide treatment are indeed dimers formed by intersubunit cross-linking and not by the cross-linking of the Ca2+ release channel to other proteins, we performed two-dimensional electrophoresis, reducing the disulfides between the first and second dimensions (37Wang K. Richards F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 8005-8018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two-dimensional SDS-PAGE is shown in Fig. 4B The membranes used in the experiment shown in Fig. 4B had a significant amount of a 400-kDa fragment of the Ca2+ release channel, which is derived from the 565-kDa band by calpain digestion (38Rardon D.P. Cefali D.C. Mitchell R.D. Seiler S.M. Hathaway D.R. Jones L.R. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 39Gilchirst J.S.C. Wang K.K.W. Katz S. Belcastro A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20857-20865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both bands underwent cross-linking to form higher molecular weight complexes. Upon reduction prior to the second dimension (Fig. 4B), the high molecular weight bands decreased to 565-kDa and 400-kDa bands. Surprisingly, very little cross-linking was detected between the 400-kDa and the 565-kDa proteins. Instead both the 565-kDa and the 400-kDa proteins appeared to form only homodimers, suggesting that, when the 565-kDa is digested to the 400-kDa, the other subunits within the tetramer are also digested. Although only high molecular weight bands are shown in this gel, we have extensively searched for lower molecular weight bands such as triadin and have found no evidence that any other protein is involved in the diamide-induced cross-linking to the Ca2+ release channel (data not shown). To determine if the formation of intersubunit cross-links correlates with channel activation, membranes were treated with increasing concentrations of diamide. The effect of these treatments on [3H]ryanodine binding is shown in Fig. 5A Diamide treatment enhanced [3H]ryanodine binding. To quantitate the formation of dimers, the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel was scanned with a densitometer and the optical densities of the dimer and monomer were plotted as a function of diamide concentration (Fig. 5B). The disappearance of the 565-kDa band correlated with the appearance of the dimer and with enhanced [3H]ryanodine binding. At higher concentrations of diamide (1 mM and higher), the intensity of the dimer also decreased and higher oligomers appeared to accumulate at the top of the gel. Formation of higher oligomers was accompanied by a decrease in [3H]ryanodine binding. Channels pretreated with diamide and washed prior to incorporation into planar lipid bilayers showed a substantial activation compared to controls (Fig. 5C). In the experiment shown, the Po increased from 0.02 to 0.22 with 500 μM diamide. To determine whether diamide and NEM react with the same sulfhydryls, we examined the effect of NEM on the diamide-activated channel. The single-channel records are shown in Fig. 6. The first tracing is the control (Po = 0.03 ± 0.01, n = 3). Addition of 250 μM diamide activated the channel (Po = 0.12 ± 0.03, n = 3). The addition of 5 mM NEM to the diamide-modified channel stimulated channel activity further. The Po with NEM was 0.53 ± 0.04 (n = 3) within the first 5 min. This activation is not reversed by DTT (data not shown). NEM does not cause phase 1 inhibition in the diamide-pretreated membranes. Sulfhydryls involved in channel activation by diamide, therefore, appear to be different than those involved in activation by NEM. Continued incubation with NEM leads to channel inhibition. Additional activation by NEM is also seen with channels pretreated with higher concentrations (500 μM to 1 mM) of diamide (data not shown). To examine further the relationship between sulfhydryls altered by diamide and those that react with NEM, we examined the effect of pretreatment of membranes with diamide on the ability of NEM to alter [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 7A). In these experiments the membranes were reacted first with 250 μM diamide for 30 min and then with 5 mM NEM. At various times after NEM addition, aliquots were removed and the reaction stopped by the addition of DTT. The samples were then assayed for [3H]ryanodine binding. As can be seen in Fig. 7A, diamide pretreatment prevented"

MEN 2 mutations have been shown to result in RET oncogenic activation. The RET gene encodes several isoforms whose biological properties, when altered by MEN 2 mutations, have not been thoroughly addressed yet. In this study, we have introduced a MEN 2A mutation (Cys634-->Arg) and the unique MEN 2B mutation (Met918-->Thr) in two RET isoforms of 1114 and 1072 amino acids which differ in the carboxy-terminus part. Herein, we report that each RET isoform activated by MEN 2A or MEN 2B mutation was transforming in fibroblasts and induced neuronal differentiation of pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. However, among the different RET-MEN 2 mutants, the long RET isoform activated by the MEN 2B mutation stimulated the most prominent neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, while the short RET isoform counterpart elicited a very weak differentiation effect in PC12 cells. We further demonstrate that the morphological changes of PC12 cells caused by constitutively activated RET oncoproteins involved the engagement of a Ras-dependent pathway. These findings provide evidence that the biological properties of RET-MEN 2 mutants depend on the interplay between the RET isoforms and the nature of the activating MEN 2 mutation."

The enzymes act at the lipid-water interface with a preference for organized lipids (micelles and vesicles) that is often orders of magnitudes greater than that shown for dispersed substrate. Calcium-mediated catalysis appears to involve two kinetically and structurally distinct steps (5Jain M.K. Berg O.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 6Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Hanel A.M. Berg O.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Adsorption of PLA2 to the interface precedes and is independent of substrate binding to the active site. Secretory PLA2s are small proteins (14 kDa) that can be classified into at least four groups based on structural differences (7Heinrikson R.L. Krueger E.T. Keim P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4913-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 31: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Class I (exocrine pancreas and elapidae and hydrophodiae snake venoms) and Class II (mammalian nonpancreatic and crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms) enzymes are highly homologous (see Fig. 1) and have been extensively studied. Crystallographic and NMR analyses of multiple secretory PLA2s have implicated a common interfacial adsorption surface that is structurally distinct from the active site (2Scott D.L. Sigler P.B. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1994; 45: 53-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The proposed interfacial adsorption site is located on a flat external surface which incorporates a ring of hydrophobic and cationic residues. Recent genetic studies have shown that the adsorption of the Class I bovine pancreatic PLA2 to anionic interfaces is driven primarily by a few cationic residues, particularly Lys-56 and Lys-116 (10Dua R. Wu S.-K. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 263-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These residues are not conserved among PLA2s, indicating that many of the key determinants of interfacial adsorption differ among enzyme species.The venom of eastern cottonmouth, Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus, contains two cationic monomeric PLA2s, Asp-49 PLA2 (App-D49) and Lys-49 PLA2, and a dimeric PLA2. Among these PLA2s, App-D49 has served as the prototype for a Class II PLA2 (11Maraganore J.M. Merutka G. Cho W. Welches W. Kézdy F.J. Heinrikson R.L. J. Biol.

Lysines 7 and 10 lie near the carboxyl end of the amino-terminal helix within a cationic patch that also includes Lys-11 and Lys-16 (see Fig. 2). This patch lies at the periphery of the proposed interfacial adsorption surface. At least two other lysines (Lys-54 and Lys-69), which lie on the other side of the enzyme in close proximity to the substrate binding site, also appear to play influential roles in interfacial catalysis. In particular, Lys-69, which is highly conserved among Class II secretory PLA2s, has been shown to interact with the sn-3 phosphate oxygen of transition state analogs (17Scott D.L. White S.P.

In an effort to further characterize the structural determinants underlying interfacial kinetics, we have determined the crystal structure of App-D49 and analyzed the impact of selected mutations within the interfacial adsorption surface (i.e, E6R, K7E, K10E, K11E, and K16E). The side chains at sequence positions 54 and 69 were also altered to determine the effect of these substitutions on both interfacial adsorption and head group selectivity (K54E and K69Y). From the results it is clear that although the adsorption of both the bovine enzyme and App-D49 to anionic interfaces is largely dependent on lysine residues, the locations of these critical residues are quite different. This variability in the topography of the adsorption surface may have an important role in determining the specific orientation of the enzyme at the substrate interface.Fig. 2A stereoview of the α-carbon trace of the crystalline App-D49 indicating the positions of mutated residues. The view of the enzyme shown here is similar to that used in previous publications to illustrate the location of a co-crystallized transition-state analog (9Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z.

The active site lies at the base of the central cavity formed from the amino-terminal helix, residues 19-23, portions of the calcium-binding loop, and the side chain of Lys-69 and is indicated by the side chain of His-48 (in black). The plane of the putative interfacial adsorption surface lies perpendicular to the hydrophobic channel and incorporates residues surrounding the external opening of the channel. In the present study, specific lysine residues (Lys-7, Lys-10, Lys-11, Lys-16, Lys-54, and Lys-69) were changed into glutamates and tyrosine (Lys-69) in an effort to characterize the structural determinants of interfacial adsorption.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) INTRODUCTIONPhospholipases A2 (PLA2; EC 3.1.1.4) 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2phospholipase A2App-D49Asp-49 PLA2 from A. p. piscivorusBLPC1,2-bis[12-(lipoyloxy)dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineBLPG1,2-bis[12-(lipoyloxy)dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglyceroldiC8PC1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholinediC8PE1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolaminePCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePGphosphatidylglycerolpyrene-PC1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholinepyrene-PE1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolaminepyrene-PG1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol. catalyze the hydrolysis of the fatty acid ester in the 2-position of 3-sn-phospholipids and are found both in intracellular and secreted forms (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Dennis E.A.

The proposed interfacial adsorption site is located on a flat external surface which incorporates a ring of hydrophobic and cationic residues.

The mutations βK155Q, βD242N, and βE181Q were each combined with the βY331W mutation; the fluorescence signal of β-Trp-331 was used to determine MgATP, MgADP, ATP, and ADP binding parameters for the three catalytic sites of the enzyme. The quantitative contribution of side chains to binding energy at all three catalytic sites was calculated. The following conclusions were made. The major functional interaction of β-Lys-155 is with the γ-phosphate of MgATP and is of primary importance at site 1 (the site of highest affinity) and site 2. Release of MgATP during oxidative phosphorylation requires conformational re-positioning of this residue. The major functional interaction of β-Asp-242 is with the magnesium of the magnesium nucleotide at site 1; it has little or no influence at site 2 or 3.

INTRODUCTIONThe final step in oxidative phosphorylation, the synthesis of ATP driven by a proton gradient, is carried out by the enzyme ATP synthase. It is abundant in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria; in bacteria, it is also used to build a transmembrane proton gradient, using ATP hydrolysis as the energy source. The enzyme consists of the membrane-embedded F0-sector, containing the proton-conducting pathway, and the membrane-extrinsic F1-sector, containing the nucleotide-binding sites. Purified, soluble F1 retains ATPase activity and is extensively used as an experimental model. It shows the subunit composition α3β3γδε (for reviews, see Refs. 1Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 2Fillingame R.H. Krulwich T.A. The Bacteria. Academic Press, New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar, 3Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography of bovine mitochondrial F1 demonstrated that the three α- and three β-subunits are alternately arranged in a hexagon, with γ in the center. The three catalytic sites are made up predominantly by β-subunit residues, with two side chains from α-subunits also in close proximity to the bound nucleotide (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar).F1 shows strong positive catalytic cooperativity. If just one of the three catalytic sites becomes occupied by MgATP (“unisite catalysis”), hydrolysis proceeds slowly, and the products MgADP and Pi are released very slowly (5Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar, 6Senior A.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In a molecule in which two sites have bound MgATP (“bisite catalysis”), hydrolysis proceeds, but release of products is slow, so that net turnover remains slow (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Only when all three catalytic sites in each molecule bind MgATP does rapid, physiological ATPase turnover ensue (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions of rapid turnover, the vast majority of molecules in the solution exist at any given point in time in a state in which all three catalytic sites are occupied, two by MgADP and one by MgATP (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Deduction of the catalytic properties of F1 has relied heavily on development of a true equilibrium binding technique for analysis of MgATP binding. It had been shown that in active, soluble, purified F1, all three catalytic sites bind the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analogs MgAMP-PNP 1The abbreviations used are: MgAMP-PNPMg-5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphateMg-TNP-ATPMg-2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate. and Mg-lin-benzo-ADP (9Wise J.G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these reports demonstrated pronounced binding cooperativity among the three sites. For analysis of MgAMP-PNP binding, it was possible to use radioactive nucleotide in conjunction with the centrifuge column technique because significant loss did not occur during centrifugation. For analysis of Mg-lin-benzo-ADP binding, the intrinsic fluorescence signal of the analog itself could be used. Neither of these approaches was viable for measurement of MgATP binding. For MgATP binding, the method of choice has proved to be tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy using specifically engineered tryptophan residues placed strategically in the catalytic sites as reporter probes. This technique has demonstrated that all three sites bind MgATP, with marked binding cooperativity being evident (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel results were obtained with the slowly hydrolyzed analog Mg-TNP-ATP (12Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3474-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Magnesium is critical for catalytic site binding cooperativity, and in its absence, all three sites bound ATP with the same affinity (Kd(ATP) = 71 μM) (11Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That is to say, the catalytic sites behave symmetrically toward nucleotides in the absence of magnesium.Site-directed mutagenesis is a valuable approach for studies of enzyme mechanism and has already been applied advantageously to studies of F1 catalytic sites (1Senior A.E.

Several laboratories have studied β-Glu-181, and there is general agreement that a carboxyl group at this position is critical (13Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol.

Our laboratory reported that the mutation βE181Q had a dramatic effect on the reaction equilibrium and rate constants in unisite catalysis by destabilizing the reaction transition state (13Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21471-21478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, β-Glu-181 has been considered to be involved in the catalytic reaction step.The x-ray structure of bovine mitochondrial F1 (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) revealed that previous proposals regarding the locations of β-Lys-155, β-Asp-242, and β-Glu-181 were correct and that previous deductions about the roles of these residues in catalysis were well founded. Fig. 1A shows the position of each in the catalytic site. In addition, it may be noted that the discovery of a water molecule situated between β-Glu-181 and the γ-phosphate of MgATP (see Fig. 1A) led to the suggestion (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) that β-Glu-181 might act as a catalytic base, activating the water for nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate.In previous mutagenesis studies of β-Lys-155, β-Asp-242, and β-Glu-181, the catalytic and nucleotide binding parameters reported were restricted to catalytic site 1 (the site of highest affinity) because only “unisite” techniques could be used. The tryptophan fluorescence technique had not yet been developed, and so nucleotide binding parameters for catalytic sites 2 and 3 were not accessible. Therefore, to further investigate the molecular role of these three critical residues, we combined each of the inhibitory mutations, βK155Q, βD242N, and βE181Q, with the βY331W mutation and determined nucleotide binding parameters at all three catalytic sites. As shown in Fig. 1B, in wild-type enzyme, β-Tyr-331 makes van der Waals contact with the adenine ring of bound nucleotide in the catalytic sites. When Trp is substituted at residue β331, it shows a large fluorescence signal that is completely quenched on binding of nucleotide (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified F1 was obtained from each of the mutants βK155Q/βY331W, βD242N/βY331W, and βE181Q/βY331W, and binding parameters for MgATP, MgADP, ATP, and ADP at each of the three catalytic sites were determined using the β-Trp-331 fluorescence signal. INTRODUCTIONThe final step in oxidative phosphorylation, the synthesis of ATP driven by a proton gradient, is carried out by the enzyme ATP synthase. It is abundant in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria; in bacteria, it is also used to build a transmembrane proton gradient, using ATP hydrolysis as the energy source. The enzyme consists of the membrane-embedded F0-sector, containing the proton-conducting pathway, and the membrane-extrinsic F1-sector, containing the nucleotide-binding sites. Purified, soluble F1 retains ATPase activity and is extensively used as an experimental model. It shows the subunit composition α3β3γδε (for reviews, see Refs. 1Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 2Fillingame R.H. Krulwich T.A. The Bacteria. Academic Press, New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar, 3Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography of bovine mitochondrial F1 demonstrated that the three α- and three β-subunits are alternately arranged in a hexagon, with γ in the center. The three catalytic sites are made up predominantly by β-subunit residues, with two side chains from α-subunits also in close proximity to the bound nucleotide (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar).F1 shows strong positive catalytic cooperativity. If just one of the three catalytic sites becomes occupied by MgATP (“unisite catalysis”), hydrolysis proceeds slowly, and the products MgADP and Pi are released very slowly (5Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar, 6Senior A.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In a molecule in which two sites have bound MgATP (“bisite catalysis”), hydrolysis proceeds, but release of products is slow, so that net turnover remains slow (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Only when all three catalytic sites in each molecule bind MgATP does rapid, physiological ATPase turnover ensue (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions of rapid turnover, the vast majority of molecules in the solution exist at any given point in time in a state in which all three catalytic sites are occupied, two by MgADP and one by MgATP (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Deduction of the catalytic properties of F1 has relied heavily on development of a true equilibrium binding technique for analysis of MgATP binding. It had been shown that in active, soluble, purified F1, all three catalytic sites bind the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analogs MgAMP-PNP 1The abbreviations used are: MgAMP-PNPMg-5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphateMg-TNP-ATPMg-2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate. and Mg-lin-benzo-ADP (9Wise J.G. Duncan T.M. Latchney L.R. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Weber J. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Wise J.G. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these reports demonstrated pronounced binding cooperativity among the three sites. For analysis of MgAMP-PNP binding, it was possible to use radioactive nucleotide in conjunction with the centrifuge column technique because significant loss did not occur during centrifugation. For analysis of Mg-lin-benzo-ADP binding, the intrinsic fluorescence signal of the analog itself could be used. Neither of these approaches was viable for measurement of MgATP binding. For MgATP binding, the method of choice has proved to be tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy using specifically engineered tryptophan residues placed strategically in the catalytic sites as reporter probes. This technique has demonstrated that all three sites bind MgATP, with marked binding cooperativity being evident (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel results were obtained with the slowly hydrolyzed analog Mg-TNP-ATP (12Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3474-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Magnesium is critical for catalytic site binding cooperativity, and in its absence, all three sites bound ATP with the same affinity (Kd(ATP) = 71 μM) (11Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That is to say, the catalytic sites behave symmetrically toward nucleotides in the absence of magnesium.Site-directed mutagenesis is a valuable approach for studies of enzyme mechanism and has already been applied advantageously to studies of F1 catalytic sites (1Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 2Fillingame R.H. Krulwich T.A. The Bacteria.

In this report, we investigate the expression patterns and the specificity of the FGF-8 isoforms for known fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors. RNAs for seven of the eight potential isoforms are present at multiple sites of embryonic Fgf8 expression. None of the FGF-8 isoforms exhibited activity when assayed with BaF3 cells expressing the “b” splice forms of FGF receptors 1-3, which are mostly expressed in epithelial tissues. Mesenchymally expressed “c” splice forms of FGF receptors 2 and 3 and FGF receptor 4 were activated by several FGF-8 isoforms.

The murine Fgf8 gene is unusual in the FGF family in that there are four exons (exons 1A-1D) equivalent to the usual exon 1 in other FGF genes (22MacArthur C.A. Shankar D.B. Shackleford G.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2501-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Crossley P.H. Martin G.R. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 439-451PubMed Google Scholar, 32MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J.S. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3603-3613PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the four alternatively spliced exons results in potentially eight protein isoforms that differ at their amino termini and share a common carboxyl terminus encoded by exons 1D, 2, and 3 (22MacArthur C.A. Shankar D.B. Shackleford G.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2501-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Crossley P.H. Martin G.R. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 439-451PubMed Google Scholar, 32MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J.S. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3603-3613PubMed Google Scholar). Human FGF8 is similar to murine Fgf8 in structure; however, only four of the protein isoforms are encoded by FGF8 due to a blocked reading frame in the longer form of exon 1B (33Gemel J. Gorry M. Ehrlich G.D. MacArthur C.A. Genomics. 1996; 35: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).The significance of the multiple FGF-8 protein isoforms is not clear. RNAs encoding several of these isoforms, or the protein isoforms, have been detected in the mouse embryo by ribonuclease protection and in situ hybridization assays (23Heikinheimo M. Lawshé A. Shackleford G.M. Wilson D.B. MacArthur C.A. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 32MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J.S. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3603-3613PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating no significant difference in the expression patterns of the RNAs encoding the different FGF-8 isoforms. One exception is that RNA encoding FGF-8a was not seen in E10.5 tail bud (27Mahmood R. Bresnick J. Hornbruch A. Mahony C. Morton N. Colquhoun K. Martin P. Lumsden A. Dickson C. Mason I. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Also, multiple Fgf8 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the tail bud, limb bud, forebrain, and midbrain-hindbrain junction of E9.5 embryos, but RNA for FGF-8b was thought to be predominant (25Crossley P.H. Martin G.R. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 439-451PubMed Google Scholar). While there are discrepancies in the temporal and spatial expression of the various isoforms during development, there are some differences in their biological activity. FGF-8b potently transforms NIH 3T3 cells, while FGF-8a and FGF-8c do so weakly (34Kouhara H. Koga M. Kasayama S. Tanaka A. Kishimoto T. Sato B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 455-462PubMed Google Scholar, 35MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Shankar D.B. Heikinheimo M. Shackleford G.M. Cell Growth & Diff. 1995; 6: 817-825PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-8b binds to and stimulates mitogenesis in cells containing FGFR3c > FGFR4 > FGFR2c, while FGF-8c interacts with FGFR3c > FGFR4 and does not interact with FGFR2c (32MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J.S. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3603-3613PubMed Google Scholar). Although FGF-8a had some activity in a limb bud assay (27Mahmood R. Bresnick J. Hornbruch A. Mahony C. Morton N. Colquhoun K. Martin P. Lumsden A. Dickson C. Mason I. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), no activity for FGF-8a with any of the known FGFRs was demonstrated in vitro (32MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J.S. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3603-3613PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-8a, FGF-8b, and FGF-8c did not interact appreciably with FGFR1b, FGFR1c, FGFR2b, or FGFR3b, suggesting that epithelially produced FGF-8 isoforms interact with mesenchymally located receptors (32MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J.S. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3603-3613PubMed Google Scholar).We now show that at multiple sites of Fgf8 expression during murine embryogenesis, RNAs encoding seven of the eight potential FGF-8 protein isoforms are present, suggesting that there is little, if any, temporal or spatial regulation of FGF-8 isoforms during development. We further demonstrate that there are three classes of FGF-8 isoforms with respect to their interactions with FGFRs: FGF-8b, and FGF-8f, which interact with FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4; FGF-8c, FGF-8d, FGF-8e, and FGF-8g, which interact with FGFR3c and FGFR4; and FGF-8a, which does not interact with any of the known FGFRs (32MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J.S. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3603-3613PubMed Google Scholar), These results suggest that the different FGF-8 isoforms are redundant.DISCUSSIONThe alternative splicing of Fgf8, resulting in multiple protein isoforms, is unique in the FGF family, and the role of the different isoforms is unclear. One possibility is that the different FGF-8 isoforms are expressed in different temporal and/or spatial contexts. A second possibility is that different FGF-8 isoforms bind to and activate different FGFRs. A third possibility is that the different FGF-8 isoforms are redundant and serve no unique roles. If this latter possibility is true, any regulation of FGF-8 signaling would be at the level of receptor expression. Our results (Fig. 2) and those in the literature (25Crossley P.H. Martin G.R. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 439-451PubMed Google Scholar, 32MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J.S. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3603-3613PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that at multiple sites of Fgf8 expression, RNAs encoding all known FGF-8 isoforms are present. It is possible that subtle quantitative differences in the steady-state levels of RNA encoding FGF-8 isoforms exist (25Crossley P.H. Martin G.R. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 439-451PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mahmood R. Bresnick J. Hornbruch A. Mahony C. Morton N. Colquhoun K. Martin P. Lumsden A. Dickson C. Mason I. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), but the significance of potential differences remains to be determined. Although some regulation of alternative splicing may exist, the regulation is not absolute, and there is no discernible temporal or spatial regulation of FGF-8 isoform expression.Given the apparent lack of temporal or spatial differences in FGF-8 isoform location, we examined the different FGF-8 isoforms for mitogenic activity in cells expressing defined FGFRs. FGF-8b and FGF-8f are similar in their activation of FGFRs, stimulating mitogenesis with FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4 (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). FGF-8c, FGF-8e, and FGF-8g activate FGFR3c and FGFR4, but not FGFR2c (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). FGF-8d is similar to FGF-8b and FGF-8f, but it only weakly activates FGFR2c (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). These results indicate that rather than activating distinct receptors, the FGF-8 isoforms are very similar in activity. None of the isoforms activate the “b” splice forms of FGFR1-3 (Fig. 4, Fig. 5), demonstrating that one role of Fgf8 in development is to signal in a paracrine fashion from epithelial (site of Fgf8 expression) to mesenchymal (location of “c” splice forms of FGFR2 and FGFR3) regions (32MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J.S. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3603-3613PubMed Google Scholar).From a structure-function view, it appears that the 11 amino acids encoded by the 5′-region of the longer form of exon 1D (Fig. 1) are responsible for the ability of FGF-8 isoforms to activate FGFR2c. The isoforms that contain these 11 amino acids (FGF-8b, FGF-8d, and FGF-8f) (Fig. 1) are the only isoforms that activate FGFR2c (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). We hypothesize that if FGF-8h exists, it would also have some activity for FGFR2c.These assays were performed at nanomolar concentrations of FGF-8 (Fig. 4). It is not clear what the physiologically relevant concentration of FGF-8 isoforms is during development. However, we (32MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J.S. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3603-3613PubMed Google Scholar) and others (34Kouhara H. Koga M. Kasayama S. Tanaka A. Kishimoto T. Sato B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 455-462PubMed Google Scholar) have shown some activity of FGF-8 isoforms on FGFR1c when the concentration of FGF-8 is in the micromolar range. The importance of this weaker interaction for normal development remains to be determined.FGF-8b has recently been shown to induce, initiate, and maintain the development of the chick limb (28Crossley P.H. Minowada G. MacArthur C.A. Martin G.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and has been shown to induce an ectopic midbrain when placed in the caudal forebrain of the chick embryo (29Crossley P.H. Martinez S. Martin G.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). As Fgf8 is expressed normally at these locations in the chick (28Crossley P.H. Minowada G. MacArthur C.A.

Biol. 1995; 5: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), it is likely that one or more of the FGF-8 isoforms normally perform these functions during vertebrate development. Given that FGF-8b can perform these functions (28Crossley P.H. Minowada G. MacArthur C.A. Martin G.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 29Crossley P.H. Martinez S. Martin G.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) and that it is highly conserved evolutionarily (mouse and human, 100% identical; chicken, 82% identical) (28Crossley P.H. Minowada G. MacArthur C.A. Martin G.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 33Gemel J. Gorry M. Ehrlich G.D. MacArthur C.A. Genomics. 1996; 35: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it seems likely that it is an important FGF-8 isoform. FGF-8f has very similar activity to FGF-8b in our mitogenic assays and is nearly as well conserved evolutionarily as FGF-8b (mouse and human, 97% identical) (33Gemel J. Gorry M. Ehrlich G.D. MacArthur C.A. Genomics. 1996; 35: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The role of the other FGF-8 isoforms is less clear. FGF-8c, FGF-8d, FGF-8g, and FGF-8h are not encoded by human FGF8 (33Gemel J. Gorry M. Ehrlich G.D. MacArthur C.A. Genomics. 1996; 35: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). FGF-8a and FGF-8e are the least potent isoforms in our assays, but they may have roles in non-mitogenic contexts or with as yet undiscovered FGFRs. The possibility of heterodimerization of FGF-8 ligands and their effects on FGFR signaling remain to be determined.

To identify binding partners that regulate the function of these ubiquitous transcription factors, we screened for proteins that interacted with the C terminus of E12 by the yeast interaction trap. UbcE2A, a rat enzyme that is highly homologous to and functionally complements the yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9, was identified and cloned. UbcE2A appears to be an E2A-selective ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme because it interacts specifically with a 54-amino acid region in E47-(477-530) distinct from the helix-loop-helix domain. In contrast, most of the UbcE2A protein is required for interaction with an E2A protein. The E2A proteins appear to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway because the E12 half-life of 60 min is extended by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and E12 is multi-ubiquitinated <i>in vivo</i> Finally, antisense UbcE2A reduces E12 degradation.

T., Adams, C. C., Vettese-Dadey, M., and Workman, J. L. (1994) EMBO J. 13, 6031-6040). We have tested whether this inhibition resulted from H1-mediated changes in nucleosome positioning (Ura, K., Hayes, J. J., and Wolffe, A. P. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 3752-3765) forcing the USF recognition sequence into less accessible locations within the nucleosome. Nucleosome boundaries were determined by assays combining micrococcal nuclease and restriction endonuclease digestion. A unique pair of boundaries were observed, indicating a single nucleosome translational position. This nucleosome position did not change on H1 or USF binding. Thus, H1 repression of USF binding was independent of nucleosome mobility, indicating an alternative mechanism of H1 repression. H1 repressed USF binding at a site 35 base pairs into the nucleosome core more effectively than at a site near the “linker” DNA, suggesting that inhibition by H1 was not simply due to steric occlusion. Instead, these data are consistent with a model by which H1 binding reduces transient dynamic exposure of the DNA from the histone octamer surface (Polach, K. L., and Widom, J. (1995) J. Mol. Biol. 254, 130-149). Previously, we reported that histone H1 binding to nucleosome cores results in the repression of binding of the basic helix-loop-helix upstream stimulatory factor (USF) (Juan, L.-J., Utley, R. T., Adams, C. C., Vettese-Dadey, M., and Workman, J. L. (1994) EMBO J. 13, 6031-6040).

Biol. 254, 130-149). Biochemical studies have implicated both nucleosome core assembly and/or the subsequent binding of the linker histone H1 in transcriptional repression (4Workman J.L. Abmayr S.M.

Because the affinities of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins for nucleosomal DNA are often dramatically reduced compared with free DNA (reviewed in Ref. 10Owen-Hughes T.A. Workman J.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 403-441PubMed Google Scholar), nucleosomes repress the transcriptional process, at least in part, by inhibiting access of activator proteins to their cognate binding sites in chromatin. Factor occupancy of binding sites in nucleosomal arrays is most likely achieved through multiple mechanisms involving nucleosome disruption, nucleosome displacement in trans, or histone octamer sliding in cis (reviewed in Ref. 11Steger D.J. Workman J.L. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The idea of mobile nucleosomes (i.e. nucleosome sliding) is attractive in that it has the potential to create transient accessibility of factors to their binding sites. Its potential importance is further implicated in studies that illustrate the differential affinity of factors for sites at different translational and rotational positions within nucleosomes (12Li Q. Wrange O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Li B. Adams C.C. Workman J.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 220: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have previously reported that nucleosomes adopt a dominant position surrounded by minor positions 10 base pairs apart (i.e. in the same rotational frame). These data indicate that the cluster of octamer positions is in dynamic equilibrium in low ionic strength conditions. In the presence of the linker histone H1, this mobility is inhibited (19Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10275-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The same group found that this short range sliding behavior also applies to bulk mononucleosomes and nucleosomes reconstituted onto sequences of the Alu family of ubiquitous repeats. Thus, they proposed that nucleosome mobility is a general behavior (20Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Moreover, H1-mediated reduction in nucleosome mobility has been implicated in repression of transcription of a dinucleosome reconstituted onto a dimerized Xenopus somatic 5 S rRNA gene (2Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we reported for the first time direct inhibition of factor binding by the association of H1 with nucleosome cores.

In this report, we extend these studies to explore the underlying mechanisms by which H1 repressed USF binding. The results illustrate H1-mediated repression of USF binding to a stably positioned nucleosome. Thus, H1 repression in this instance occurred in the absence of nucleosome mobility. In addition, H1 repressed USF binding to a site on the opposite side of the histone octamer from the entry and exit points of the linker DNA. These data are consistent with a mechanism by which H1 stabilizes histone octamer-DNA interactions, thus reducing transient exposure of factor binding sites. upstream stimulatory factor base pair(s) Tris borate/EDTA globular domain of histone H1 micrococcal nuclease. The 183-bp probe DNAs, referred to as GU or UG probes, were either directly generated by BamHI digestion of plasmids pGALUSFBEND or pUSFGALBEND, followed by Klenow incorporation of [α-32P]dATP, or prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification from plasmid pGALUSFBEND and body-labeled by the incorporation of [α-32P]dATP. The primers used for amplification were GUB-5′ (5′-GATCCTCTAGACGGAGGACA-3′) and GUB-3′ (5′-GATCCCTCGATTCCATGG-3′). These plasmids were constructed by inserting the 46-base pair oligonucleotide (5′-ctagacGGAGGACAGTCCTCCggt-taccttcgaacCACGTGgccgt-3′), containing consensus GAL4 and USF binding sites (capitalized) separated by 14 bp, into the XbaI site of the pBEND-derived vector pTK401 (21Kerppola T.K.

The probes were purified from 8% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 29:1)/1× Tris borate/EDTA (TBE) gels. Nucleosome cores were purified from HeLa nuclei as described (1Juan L.-J. Utley R.T.

A 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel of the digestion products is shown. Digestion of the 183-bp nucleosome core without bound H1 (lanes 6-9) demonstrated a primary digestion intermediate of ∼146 bp.

Utley R.T. Adams C.C. Vettese-Dadey M. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6031-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The final nucleosome dilutions in the absence or presence of H1 in 0.1 M NaCl were divided for USF binding reactions such that each binding reaction contained 0.3 mg of nucleosomal DNA. At this point, the transcription factors were added at the amounts indicated in the figure legends. Binding reactions contained 100 mM NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mM ZnCl2, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 4 mM dithiothreitol. The binding reactions were carried out at 30°C for 30 min with a final volume of 27-40 μl, loaded onto 4% acrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 29:1)/0.5 × TBE gels, and run at 150 V (constant voltage) for 3 h at room temperature. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. In addition, each gel was quantitated using a Betascope blot analyzer (Betagen Corp.). To determine the nucleosome boundaries, we adapted the method of Meersseman et al. (18Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This method uses a combination of micrococcal nuclease and restriction enzyme digestion. The exact protocol is outlined in Fig. 2B and described in detail as follows. Nucleosome cores and chromatosomes were reconstituted onto a polymerase chain reaction-generated, 32P body-labeled probe, GUB183-USF45, as described above, except that: 1) 1 mM EDTA was omitted from all the dilution buffers; and 2) 20% glycerol was also omitted and replaced by 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the final dilution buffer (step 0.2 to 0.1 M NaCl). To monitor the successful reconstitution, a 13-μl aliquot from the 96-μl final dilutions in 0.1 M NaCl containing 8.75 μg of nucleosomes in the absence of H1 or in the presence of one or two molecules of H1 (relative to one molecule of nucleosome) was removed and mixed with 1.3 μl of 10 × tracking dye (0.42% bromphenol blue, 0.42% xylene cyanol FF, and 50% glycerol), followed by loading the mixtures onto a 6% acrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 29:1)/0.5 × TBE gel and running in 0.5 × TBE at 150 V (constant voltage) for 5-6 h. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films as described above. The rest of the samples were digested with micrococcal nuclease (0.05 unit, Sigma) after 3 mM CaCl2 was included in each reaction mixture (digestion of mock-reconstituted DNA requires 10-fold less nuclease, whereas digestion of nucleosome in the presence of two molecules of H1 requires 3-fold more nuclease). Digestion was performed at room temperature. Aliquots (14 μl, approximately 30,000 cpm) were removed after 0, 1, 5, 15, and 30 min, stopped, and deproteinized with 25 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml Proteinase K, and 0.13 mg/ml tRNA. After 4-5 h of incubation at 37°C, DNA was precipitated, pelleted, and washed once with 80% ethanol. Pellets were air dried for 5 min and resuspended in 5 μl of 1 × tracking dye (0.042% bromphenol blue, 0.042% xylene cyanol FF, and 5% glycerol). Samples were then loaded onto a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 29:1)/1 × TBE gel and run in 1 × TBE at 300 V (constant voltage) for 5 h at room temperature. The native gel (27 cm in length) was poured with 0.4-mm spacers. After completion of gel electrophoresis, the wet gel was exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at 4°C for 4-5 h. The exposed film was used as a guide for removal of DNA fragments of interest from the wet gel. In these experiments, the 146-bp core particle length bands were excised and eluted in a volume of 0.5 ml (0.6 M NaCl and 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0) at 37°C overnight. DNA was then precipitated, pelleted, and washed once with 80% ethanol. Pellets were air dried for 5 min and resuspended in 10 μl of 1 × Tris/EDTA (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). To map the positions occupied by the core particles on the DNA sequence, aliquots (3 μl) were incubated with SalI at 37°C for 5-6 h, followed by a second cleavage of BstEII at 65°C for another 5-6 h. DNA was then precipitated, pelleted, and washed once with 80% ethanol. Pellets were air dried for 5 min and resuspended in 4 μl of 80% formamide/1 mg/ml xylene cyanol/1 mg/ml bromphenol blue/10 mM EDTA, heated to 100°C for 5 min, and resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea sequencing gel. To determine the core particle positions in the presence of USF, the final nucleosome dilution was mixed with USF in a 120-μl binding reaction containing 0.36 μM nucleosome, 0.4 or 1.2 μM USF, 100 mM NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). The binding reaction was carried out at 30°C for 30 min. Samples were then digested with micrococcal nuclease and subsequent restriction enzymes as described above. Nucleosome mobility on both sea urchin and Xenopus 5 S rRNA genes has been nicely characterized (2Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 18Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol.

It is possible that short range sliding has an impact on factor binding to nucleosomes, either by making the binding sites more accessible or by burying the sites more deeply into a nucleosome. It has been shown that H1 is capable of reducing nucleosome mobility (19Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10275-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and locking the nucleosomes into a unique position concurrent with inhibition of transcription from a Xenopus 5 S rRNA gene (2Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that USF binding is repressed by H1 binding to a 183-bp nucleosome core bearing a USF site (E-box) (1Juan L.-J. Utley R.T. Adams C.C. Vettese-Dadey M. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6031-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In principle, this inhibition of USF binding could also be explained by an H1-mediated restriction of nucleosome positions. H1 binding could lock the core particle into a position where the USF site is less accessible, i.e. deeper into the nucleosome (27Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, efficient USF binding may require movement of the nucleosome to an accessible location, which might be inhibited by H1 binding. To test these possibilities, we have analyzed the position of the histone octamers on the 183-bp USF site containing probe (GU) alone and after binding of histone H1 or USF. The 183-bp, polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA template is derived from plasmid pGALUSFBEND (see “Materials and Methods”). This DNA is long enough to contain one nucleosome and may allow limited mobility of the nucleosome core, since nucleosome cores have been shown to occupy 146 bp of DNA (28Kornberg R. Science. 1974; 184: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar, 29Noll M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1974; 1: 1573-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 30Lutter L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). USF binding to nucleosome cores reconstituted with this DNA probe was inhibited by the association of intact histone H1 (Fig. 1, lanes 9-14). Concurrent with inhibition of USF binding, H1 association resulted in a decrease in the electrophoretic migration of the nucleosome (chromatosome shift; Ref. 31Juan L.-J. Walter P. Taylor I.C.A. Kingston R.E. Workman J.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), illustrating the relationship between H1 binding and reduced USF binding (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 9-14). Repression of USF binding was also observed with only the globular domain of histone H1 (G-H1) (Fig. 1, lanes 2-7), although in this instance repression was never complete. Interestingly, the binding of G-H1 increased the migration of the nucleosome particles (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 2-7). The differences in electrophoretic migration of chromatosomes containing G-H1 versus intact H1 are attributed to the tail domains of H1, which are absent in G-H1. The increased migration suggests that G-H1 binding restricted the “linker” DNA at the edge of the core particles, thereby reducing its apparent size despite the increase of molecular weight. G-H1 binding has previously been shown to provide nuclease protection of linker DNA adjacent to the nucleosome core (32Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X. Nature. 1980; 288: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 33Allan J. Mitchell T. Harbourne N. Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To investigate whether H1 repression of USF binding by intact H1 and/or G-H1 resulted from an alteration in nucleosome positioning, we mapped the location of the histone octamer in each instance. The nucleosome mapping protocol used here was derived from that of Meersseman et al. (18Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and is illustrated in Fig. 2. Control nucleosome cores reconstituted by salt dilution transfer onto the 183-bp probe (Fig. 2A) were digested to core particle length DNA with micrococcal nuclease and separated on a nondenaturing acrylamide gel (Fig. 2B). 32P body-labeled core particle DNAs were purified by excision and elution of the 146-bp bands from the gel. The core particle DNAs were then digested with two restriction enzymes to determine the locations of the micrococcal nuclease (MNase) cuts and, thus, the boundaries of the nucleosome cores. Subsequent analysis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels enabled a determination of the core particle boundaries relative to the unique restriction sites in the DNA sequence. A diagram of the relative positions of the USF binding site (45 bp from the 5′-end) and restriction enzyme sites is shown in Fig. 2A MNase-generated 146-bp core particle DNAs purified from the nondenaturing gel were first cut with SalI (70 bp from the 5′-end), followed by a second digestion with BstEII (28 bp from the 5′-end). Cutting with the first enzyme yields two fragments of different sizes for each nucleosome position, and cleavage by the second enzyme subsequently reveals which fragment specifies the 5′-end boundary. MNase digestion of the reconstituted nucleosome cores was analyzed by 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). With incubation times increasing from 0 to 15 min, a digestion product of an approximately 146-bp-length DNA was observed (Fig. 3, lanes 6-9). Importantly, this digestion intermediate was not apparent in the digestion pattern for mock-reconstituted DNA (Fig. 3, lanes 1-4). We similarly analyzed the MNase digestion products from chromatosomes reconstituted with intact H1 (Fig. 3, lanes 11-14 and 16-19) and G-H1 (Fig. 3, lanes 21-24 and 26-29). In each case a 146-bp nucleosome core digestion product was observed. These 146-bp digestion products were excised from the gel and used to establish the position of the histone octamer in each instance. As is evident from Fig. 4A, lane 3, only one major pair of bands appeared after digestion of the 146-bp MNase product derived from the nucleosome cores with SalI (lane 3). These products were 86- and 60-bp fragments adding up to 146 bp. Cleavage with the second enzyme, BstEII, did not change the intensity of the 86-bp band; however, the 60-bp fragment was cut into two smaller pieces of 42 and 18 bp, indicating that the 60-bp fragment is located on the 5′-end (Fig. 4A, lane 4). The observed doublet of each band is due to the difference in mobility of the two DNA strands on the denaturing gel, which differ in length by 2 bases. We conclude from these data that the nucleosome cores reconstituted onto this particular DNA sequence adopt a unique position, which extends 60 bp 5′ of the SalI site and 86 bp to 3′ of this location (Fig. 4B). To determine whether H1 altered the position of the histone octamer, we similarly mapped the 146-bp MNase digestion products (Fig. 3) generated from chromatosomes reconstituted with either intact H1 or G-H1. To investigate the exact location of the histone octamer in the presence of H1, the 146-bp core particle DNAs were excised from gels after digestion with MNase, followed by restriction enzyme mapping. This approach allows the determination of the octamer position without bias from the controversial issue of whether H1 binds symmetrically or asymmetrically to nucleosomes (reviewed in Ref. 34Pruss D. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The 146-bp core particle length DNAs, generated from the reconstituted chromatosomes, were excised from the nondenaturing gel, eluted, purified, and digested with SalI and BstEII, as in the case of the nucleosome core samples. Interestingly, we detected no difference between the restriction enzyme digestion pattern of chromatosome-derived nucleosome core DNA and that of nucleosome cores without H1 (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 5-16 with 2-4). In the presence of either one or two molecules of intact H1 or G-H1 per nucleosome core, the nucleosome cores were still positioned precisely at the unique site. Thus, H1-mediated nucleosome repositioning did not occur on this probe under conditions in which H1 effectively repressed USF binding. An alternative possible mechanism by which H1 might repress binding to this nucleosome is if USF binding induces a change in the position of the nucleosome core, which is prevented by the association of histone H1. To investigate this possibility the same approach was used to test whether USF binding moved the nucleosome core when interacting with its binding site. The nucleosome cores were incubated with high concentrations of USF in which more than 50% of the nucleosomes were bound (Fig. 5A, lane 2). These reactions were then digested with MNase, and 146-bp core particle DNAs were obtained (Fig. 5B). Subsequent analysis of these DNAs by restriction endonuclease digestion revealed that no novel nucleosome core positions arose as a consequence of USF binding (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 5-10 with 2-4). These experiments indicate that the histone octamer present on this particular DNA sequence was tightly positioned. This position was not altered with H1 or USF binding. Thus, in this instance, H1-mediated repression of USF binding was independent of nucleosome mobility, indicating an alternative mechanism of H1 repression. There are at least two alternative mechanisms by which H1 might repress USF binding to this nucleosome: 1) the binding of H1 to the nucleosome core may sterically hinder the interaction of USF with its recognition sequence; and 2) the binding of H1 may stabilize interactions between the histone octamer and DNA, thus indirectly inhibiting the ability of USF to access its binding site. In this regard, it is interesting that the USF site within the positioned nucleosome is 35 bp into the nucleosome core (Fig. 4B). This places the USF site almost on the opposite side of the histone octamer from the nucleosome dyad and linker DNA, where H1 is thought to bind (reviewed in Ref. 35Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 217-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further examine how the position of the USF site might affect its repression by H1, we compared USF binding with a nearly identical nucleosome core but with the USF site nearer the edge of the nucleosome. Fig. 6A illustrates the position of the USF site on the nucleosome core used in all of the experiments above (GU probe) and the related probe, which has only 46 bp inverted (UG probe). Fig. 6, B and C, illustrates USF binding to nucleosome cores reconstituted on the UG and GU probes, respectively, in the absence (lanes 1-5) or presence (lanes 6-10) of H1. The affinity of USF for the UG probe nucleosome core was greater than for the GU probe nucleosome core because of translational position effects, as shown previously (27Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the binding of USF to the UG nucleosome was less inhibited by H1 than was binding to the GU nucleosome. H1 binding resulted in a 7-fold reduction of USF binding to the GU nucleosome but only a 1.2-fold reduction of USF binding to the UG nucleosome. Thus, H1 had a greater inhibitory effect on factor binding to a position that is more distal from the edge of the nucleosome, consistent with an indirect mode of H1 repression. The fact that histone octamers are able to move in cis on a DNA fragment was reported 18 years ago (36Beard P. Cell. 1978; 15: 955-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). More recently, studies by Bradbury and co-workers (17Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) have illustrated an inherent localized mobility of histone octamers on DNA over short distances of 10s of base pairs. Furthermore, the linker histone H1 was reported to reduce the mobility of positioned nucleosomes (19Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10275-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ura and colleagues (2Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) detected a correlation between the ability of H1 to reduce nucleosome mobility and transcriptional repression of a dimerized 5 S rRNA gene nucleosome, leading to the suggestion that H1 could inhibit factor access by reducing nucleosome mobility. The experiments presented here indicate a different mechanism of H1 repression. We have previously reported that H1 mediated repression of USF binding to a reconstituted nucleosome core. In this study, we have shown that the histone octamer takes up a precise location on this particular 183-bp DNA fragment from 10 to 156 base pairs relative to the 5′-end. This position of the histone octamer was unchanged after the binding of either H1 or USF. Thus, H1-mediated repression of USF binding in this instance involved neither changes in nucleosome position nor a reduction of nucleosome mobility. This example, therefore, clearly illustrates a mechanism of H1 repression, which is independent of movement of the histone octamer. Histone H1 is thought to bind to linker DNA at the point at which DNA enters and exits the nucleosome core particle and may also interact with DNA at the nucleosome dyad (reviewed in Ref. 35Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 217-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This results in the protection of DNA at the edge of the nucleosome core particle from nuclease cleavage. By contrast, we have observed that the inhibition of USF binding by histone H1 was more pronounced at a site 35 bp into the nucleosome core than at a site near the nucleosome edge (i.e. 9 bp into the nucleosome core). Thus, the more highly repressed USF site was located on the opposite side of the histone octamer from the entry point of the linker DNA and from the nucleosome dyad. In addition, Pruss and colleagues (37Pruss D. Bartholomew B. Persinger J. Hayes J. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 274: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have recently proposed a model of asymmetric H1 binding to nucleosome cores reconstituted on 5 S rRNA genes. Even if such asymmetric binding occurred on the reconstituted USF site nucleosome cores used here, the highly repressed USF site 35 bp into the nucleosome core would be well beyond the proposed site of H1 binding, whereas the less repressed site 9 bp into the nucleosome core would be located directly at the proposed site of H1 binding. Thus, H1-mediated repression of USF binding is unlikely to have occurred by a simple process of steric occlusion of the transcription factor from its binding site. Instead, this observation suggests an indirect pathway of H1 repression. Polach and Widom (3Polach K.L. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) have proposed a dynamic equilibrium model for transcription factor access to recognition elements within nucleosomes, which is consistent with several in vitro experiments. Their model suggests that DNA on the surface of the histone octamer is dynamic, transiently exposing stretches of DNA to transcription factors. Importantly, site exposure decreases as the site is moved further into the nucleosome core, consistent with an “unpeeling” mechanism and numerous reports of translational position effects (reviewed in Ref. 10Owen-Hughes T.A. Workman J.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 403-441PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, sites deeper into the nucleosome core are more sensitive to the extent of DNA unpeeling. Histone H1 has been shown by physical studies to stabilize the interactions of linker DNA and additional DNA within the nucleosome core with the histone octamer (38Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 39Cowman M.K. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 532-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Houssier C. Lasters I. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5763-5784Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, microscopic studies and topological analysis further support a role of histone H1 in preventing the “peeling” of DNA from the surface of the histone octamer (reviewed in Ref. 35Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 217-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that H1 represses factor binding to a site 35 bp into the nucleosome core (a position not thought to interact with H1 directly) is consistent with a model whereby H1 indirectly represses factor binding by reducing transient unpeeling of DNA from the histone octamer surface, thus sealing the nucleosomal DNA. By such a mechanism, H1 binding could lead to repression of factor access over a broader region of DNA beyond its specific sites of direct interaction. The function of H1 in repressing factor binding to distal sites on a nucleosome may result from the binding of H1 generating a more compact nucleosome structure. This could result from additional charge shielding of nucleosomal DNA by H1 and/or by stabilization of the wraps of nucleosomal DNA by the binding of histone H1 to both the entering and exiting DNA helices. A contribution from the basic amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails of H1 is consistent with the observation that intact H1 provided a slightly greater level of repression than the central globular domain of H1 alone (Fig. 1). However, the fact that the globular domain of H1 alone provided the majority of the observed repression (Fig. 1) indicates that repression is largely mediated by the binding of the globular “winged helix” structure (41Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Indeed, the observation that H1 binding to reconstituted nucleosome cores is dependent on the presence of linker DNA (i.e. DNA beyond the 146 bp contained in the nucleosome core; Ref. 31Juan L.-J. Walter P. Taylor I.C.A. Kingston R.E. Workman J.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) indicates that correct binding of the central globular domain is crucial to mediating the repressive actions of H1. We thank Dr. David Steger for useful advice and critical reading of the manuscript, Dr. Colyn Crane-Robinson for helpful suggestions regarding the implementation of this study, and members of the Workman Laboratory for their advice and suggestions during the course of these experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2079565796,"The methyl ester of pyruvic acid (methyl pyruvate) stimulated a dose-dependent increase in insulin secretion from isolated perifused rat islets. The threshold level for release was about 10 mM, and at 20 mM the addition of MP to perifused islets resulted in a large first phase of secretion followed by an insulin-secretory response that was sustained for at least 40 min. When compared to the effects of 20 mM glucose, peak first-phase release rates in response to 20 mM methyl pyruvate were comparable, but the second phase of release was only about 10-15% of that observed with an equimolar level of the hexose. The stimulatory effects of 20 mM methyl pyruvate on secretion were abolished by the K1+-ATP channel blocker diazoxide (200 μM) and by the calcium channel antagonist nitrendipine (500 nM). The glucokinase inhibitor mannoheptulose (20 mM) had no adverse effect on the secretory response to 20 mM methyl pyruvate, whereas 10 μM forskolin amplified the insulinotropic action of MP. Sodium pyruvate alone or in combination with 10 μM forskolin had no insulinotropic effect. In additional experiments islet phosphoinositide pools were labeled with myo-2-[3H]inositol, and the subsequent accumulation of labeled inositol phosphates was used to monitor the activation of phospholipase C. Methyl pyruvate stimulated a dose-dependent increase in inositol phosphate levels when measured after a 30-min incubation period with a maximal increase of about 300% at 20 mM methyl pyruvate. The increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis caused by methyl pyruvate (20 mM) was, like insulin secretion, reduced by both diazoxide and nitrendipine but was immune to inhibition by mannoheptulose. Pyruvate (20 mM) had no effect on inositol phosphate accumulation. Prior short-term exposure to methyl pyruvate sensitized islets to subsequent stimulation with 15 mM glucose. Sodium pyruvate did not sensitize islets. These findings support the concept that the mitochondrial metabolism of nutrient molecules is an event sufficient to acutely augment insulin release from the beta cell, to increase phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and to induce time-dependent potentiation of insulin secretion.

INTRODUCTIONThe regulation of fuel-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells depends upon the intermediary metabolism of these compounds via several established metabolic pathways (1Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Hutton J.C. Metabolism. 1979; 28: 373-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In addition to glucose, mannose, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone, which are metabolized initially by cytosolic glycolytic enzymes (2Ashcroft S.J. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 3Hellman B. Idahl L.A. Lernmark A. Sehlin J. Taljedal I.B. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1977; 252: 8519-8523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a variety of insulinotropic nutrient molecules are metabolized solely within the mitochondria. These include among others leucine, monomethylsuccinate, and α-ketoisocaproate (6Malaisse W.J. Hutton J.C. Carpinelli A.R. Herchuelz A. Sener A. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Mertz R.J. Rana R.S. Arch. Biochem.

Because these latter stimulants for insulin secretion share in common many of the same stimulatory features of glucose on the beta cell, the concept that mitochondrial-derived signals mediate, at least in part, the stimulatory actions of the hexose has been proposed (11MacDonald M.J. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Malaisse W.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For example, both glucose and α-ketoisocaproate stimulate similar changes in insulin secretion and the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of islet phosphoinositide (PI) 1The abbreviations used are:PIphosphoinositideMPmethyl pyruvateKRBKrebs-Ringer bicarbonatePLCphospholipase CIPinositol phosphateTDPtime-dependent potentiation. pools and sensitize the beta cells to subsequent restimulation, a phenomenon also referred to as priming or time-dependent potentiation (TDP) (13Zawalich W.S. Diabetologia. 1988; 31: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Best L. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Zawalich W.S. Diaz V.A. Zawalich K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254PubMed Google Scholar).Standing at odds with this unifying concept, implicating the importance of mitochondrial signals in the regulation of secretion regardless of the nutrient molecule used, are studies with pyruvate. Although it seems to be well metabolized, pyruvate alone has no insulinotropic effect, although in combination with stimulatory glucose, a small stimulatory action has been described (16Sener A. Kawazu S. Hutton J.C. Boschev A.C. Devis G. Somers G. Herchuelz A. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Most recently, the methylated derivative of pyruvate has been reported to augment the release of insulin from the beta cells of cultured mouse islets (17Mertz R.J. Worley J.F. Spencer B. Johnson J.H. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4838-4845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, methylation seems to confer upon pyruvate stimulatory actions not inherent in the unaltered pyruvate molecule. This situation is similar to the effects of methylation on the succinate molecule, which alone has no insulinotropic effect but when methylated now exhibits many of the same stimulatory characteristics as glucose (7MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Mertz R.J. Rana R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C.

Presumably methylation renders succinate, and perhaps pyruvate as well, more membrane-permeable and allows higher levels of the compound to be achieved and acted upon by mitochondrial enzymes. In the present series of studies we explored in more detail the effects of methyl pyruvate (MP) on the beta cell. The dose dependence and calcium dependence of the insulinotropic effects of MP, the kinetics of insulin secretion from freshly isolated and perifused rat islets, as well as the ability of MP to influence PI hydrolysis in [3H]inositol-prelabeled islets were determined. The findings support the view that mitochondrial metabolism of methyl pyruvate is an event sufficient to generate the necessary metabolic and second messenger molecules to activate the beta cell insulin-secretory apparatus in a manner comparable in some regards to that seen with glucose. From a quantitative perspective, however, the maximal effects of MP on second-phase release from rat islets are significantly less than those observed with equimolar glucose.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe detailed methodologies used to assess insulin output from collagenase-isolated islets have been described previously (19Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Rasmussen H. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2400-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Rasmussen H. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in all studies. All animals were treated in a manner that complied with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animals were fed ad libitum and weighed 300-450 g. After Nembutal (pentobarbital sodium, 50 mg/kg; Abbott)-induced anesthesia islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and handpicked using a glass loop pipette under a stereo microscope. They were free of exocrine contamination. After isolation some groups of islets were directly perifused in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Perifusate solutions were gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and maintained at 37°C. Perifusate samples were collected at appropriate times and analyzed for insulin content. To label PI pools, other groups of 18-22 freshly isolated islets were placed in small glass vials and incubated for 3 h in a myo-[2-3H]inositol-containing KRB solution made up as follows. 10 μCi of myo-[2-3H]inositol (specific activity, 16-23 Ci/mmol) were placed in a 10 mm × 75-mm culture tube. To this aliquot of label 250 μl of warmed (to 37°C) and oxygenated KRB medium supplemented with 5 mM glucose were added. After mixing, 240 μl of this were gently added to the vial with islets. The vial was capped with a rubber stopper, gassed for 10 s with 95% O2, 5% CO2, and incubated at 37°C. After 90 min the vials were again gently oxygenated. After the labeling period, the islets were washed with 5 ml of fresh KRB.Inositol Phosphate (IP) MeasurementsAfter washing, the islets on nylon filters were placed in small glass vials. Added gently to the vial were 400 μl of KRB supplemented with 10 mM LiCl to prevent IP degradation and the appropriate agonists as indicated. The vials were capped and gently gassed for 5 s with 95% O2, 5% CO2. After 30 min the generation of IPs was stopped by adding 400 μl of 20% perchloric acid. Total IPs formed were then measured using Dowex columns as described previously (21Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.P. Biochem.

The perifusion medium consisted of 115 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2.2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 24 mM NaHCO3, and 0.17 g/dl bovine serum albumin. Other compounds were added as indicated, and the solution was gassed with a mixture of 95% O2, 5% CO2. The 125I-labeled insulin used for the insulin assay was purchased from DuPont NEN. The myo-[2-3H]inositol was purchased from Amersham Corp. Bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay grade), glucose, mannoheptulose, diazoxide, the sodium salt of pyruvate, and pyruvic acid methyl ester as well as the salts used to make the Hanks' solution and perifusion medium were purchased from Sigma. Forskolin was purchased from Calbiochem. Nitrendipine was a gift from Dr. A. Scriabine (Miles Institute for Preclinical Pharmacology, West Haven, CT). Rat insulin standard (lot 615-ZS-157) was the generous gift of Dr. Gerald Gold (Lilly). Collagenase (type P) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals.StatisticsStatistical significance was determined using Student's t test for unpaired data or analysis of variance in conjunction with the Newman-Keuls test for unpaired data. A p < 0.05 was taken as significant. Values presented in the figures and under “Results” represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three observations.DISCUSSIONNutrient-stimulated insulin secretion depends on the metabolic transformation of fuel and the generation of appropriate intracellular signals. Recent studies have supported an important role for the ATP level or the ADP/ATP ratio as being an indispensable component of the signaling apparatus (31Detimary P. Jonas J.-C. Henquin J.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this view, increasing levels of ATP, a result of substrate intermediary metabolism via well-defined pathways, result in the closure of ATP-dependent K1+ channels and membrane depolarization. This event is quickly followed by opening of voltage-regulated Ca2+ channels. At least in freshly isolated rat islets, the increase in intracellular Ca2+ activates, along with yet to be defined mitochondrial signals, beta cell PLC (14Best L. Biochem.

This enzyme hydrolyzes islet PI pools, a process that generates inositol phosphates and stoichiometric amounts of diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol and Ca2+ activate protein kinase C (33Hug H.

The findings reported here with MP are compatible with these concepts of beta cell activation, and further comment on them is appropriate.Methylation of potential metabolic substrates renders them more effective insulin secretagogues. For example, whereas succinate alone is an ineffective agonist for secretion, the methylated derivative of succinate, monomethylsuccinate, is effective in this regard (7MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Mertz R.J. Rana R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 649-654PubMed Google Scholar). Monomethylsuccinate not only stimulates insulin secretion in a glucose-independent fashion, but prior exposure to it sensitizes the islet to subsequent stimulation with glucose (18Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Cline G. Shulman G. Rasmussen H. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 843-850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies and in agreement with a previous report using cultured mouse islets (17Mertz R.J. Worley J.F. Spencer B. Johnson J.H. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4838-4845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), MP but not pyruvate evoked a significant insulin-secretory response from freshly isolated rat islets. Like glucose-induced insulin secretion, the stimulatory effects of MP were reduced by diazoxide and nitrendipine. In this regard, MP is similar not only to glucose but to glyceraldehyde, monomethylsuccinate, and α-ketoisocaproate, and the assumption that it acts via a pathway(s) that converges upon a common metabolic pathway or generates a common signal seems reasonable. Thus, MP via its metabolism generates ATP, which closes ATP-dependent K1+ channels. Membrane depolarization results in the subsequent opening of voltage-regulated Ca2+ channels, influx of the divalent cation, activation of PLC, and insulin secretion. The susceptibility of the insulinotropic actions of MP to diazoxide and nitrendipine and the immunity of MP to mannoheptulose are consistent with this proposed mechanism of action. At a higher level (40 mM), MP addition reduced the secretory response of the islet. The basis for this inhibitory effect was not explored further, but the results suggest caution when exposing islets to high levels of MP.Similar to the actions of other nutrient molecules, MP activated beta cell PLC in a dose-dependent manner. The stimulatory effect of MP on IP accumulation was, like insulin release, immune to inhibition by mannoheptulose. Inositol phosphate accumulation in response to MP was reduced but not abolished by either diazoxide or nitrendipine. From a quantitative perspective the stimulatory effect of 20 mM MP on PLC activation was greater than that observed with depolarizing levels of potassium, an agonist whose stimulatory actions are dependent on calcium influx via voltage-regulated Ca2+ channels (26Henquin J.C. Charles S. Nenquin M. Mathot F. Tamagawa T. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These results suggest that more than just Ca2+ influx is involved the activation of PLC by nutrient agonists. Moreover, nitrendipine totally abolished the stimulatory action of potassium on IP accumulation, whereas it only partially reduced the effect of MP or glucose (36Zawalich W.S. Diaz V.A. Zawalich K.C. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results lead to the conclusion that both calcium and a metabolic signal participate in the regulation of nutrient-activated, PLC-mediated PI hydrolysis and that these agonists (glucose and MP) but not high potassium alone are capable of generating both of these stimulatory signals.We also performed a series of limited studies with the sodium salt of pyruvate. In agreement with previous reports (16Sener A. Kawazu S. Hutton J.C. Boschev A.C. Devis G. Somers G. Herchuelz A. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Mertz R.J. Worley J.F. Spencer B. Johnson J.H. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4838-4845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) it was without any insulinotropic effect on the beta cell even at a level of 20 mM. Inclusion of forskolin together with pyruvate, which theoretically at least should amplify even a weak pyruvate-generated stimulatory signal for secretion, was also without any positive effect. Furthermore, pyruvate had no effect on IP accumulation in islets.Prior short-term exposure to 20 mM MP enhanced the sensitivity of the islet to glucose stimulation. This amplified response, referred to TDP or priming (37Grill V. Adamson V. Cerasi E. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1034-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), is reproduced by a large number of compounds that share in common the ability to activate one of the several isozymes of PLC identified in islets (13Zawalich W.S. Diabetologia. 1988; 31: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Zawalich W.S. Diaz V.A. Zawalich K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Rasmussen H. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2400-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 38Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 16-22Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, MP shares this property with such diverse agonists as carbachol, acetylcholine, cholecystokinin, leucine, monomethylsuccinate, glucose, α-ketoisocaproate, and tolbutamide. As a working hypothesis we have proposed that the induction of TDP is a result of an increase in information flow in the PLC/protein kinase C signaling cascade (29Zawalich W.S. Diabetes Res. 1990; 13: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar, 30Zawalich W.S. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 160-176Google Scholar, 39Zawalich W.S. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because TDP is also produced by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (40Sorensen R.L.C. Horm. Metab. Res. 1986; 18: 353-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 41Niki I. Tamagawa J. Niki H. Niki A. Koide T. Sakamoto N. Acta Endocrinol. 1988; 118: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a unifying concept incorporates the activation of this enzyme and/or processes distal to it in its generation and maintenance. Not surprisingly, sodium pyruvate was impotent with regard to the induction of time-dependent potentiation of insulin release.From a quantitative perspective, these results differ from a previous study examining the insulinotropic effects of MP on the islet. For example, Mertz et al. (17Mertz R.J. Worley J.F. Spencer B. Johnson J.H. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4838-4845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reported that 20 mM MP was a 6-fold greater stimulus for insulin secretion than was 12 mM glucose. With rat islets, although the first-phase secretory responses to 20 mM MP were comparable to 20 mM glucose, sustained second-phase release rates to MP were only 10-20% of those seen with 20 mM glucose. Several obvious points of departure exist between this and the previous report, however. We used freshly isolated rat islets, and insulin secretion was monitored during a dynamic perifusion. The report by Mertz et al. (17Mertz R.J. Worley J.F. Spencer B. Johnson J.H. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4838-4845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) used cultured mouse islets, and release was measured during static incubations. It is not known which of these or other methodological differences contribute to the quantitative disparity between the actions of MP and glucose on the beta cell. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the insulin-secretory responses and biochemical findings made with one rodent species may not necessarily be extrapolated to other rodent species or human beta cells (22Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Kelley G.G. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4903-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 42Berglund O.

Physiol. 1996; 271PubMed Google Scholar).The precise nature of the metabolic signal or signals generated by MP that seem to interact with Ca2+ in the regulation of beta cell secretion and PLC activation is not known. For heuristic purposes at least, a common metabolic signal generated by all nutrient secretagogues seems to be a reasonable possibility. Based on our studies with nutrients metabolized exclusively within the mitochondria, we initially proposed that the signal was generated within this organelle. However, if the mitochondrial metabolism of glucose-derived pyruvate is exclusively responsible for the generation of this metabolic signal, then the results with sodium pyruvate remain problematic and difficult to interpret. This has to do with the inability of exogenously added pyruvate to activate either PLC or insulin secretion under conditions in which any small insulinotropic action of this compound should be manifest. A more global view might incorporate the concept that the metabolic signal may be generated by either cytosolic or mitochondrial pathways. For example, a recent report consistent with many other studies has suggested that ATP of either glycolytic or mitochondrial origin may be, along with Ca2+, the common signal involved in nutrient activation of the beta cell (31Detimary P. Jonas J.-C. Henquin J.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating membrane polarization, ATP may serve as an important signaling molecule in other transduction systems as well, and the regulation of information flow in the PLC pathway may be one of them. This action of ATP may be exerted at multiple sites in the PLC/protein kinase C signaling cascade, including, but not confined to, the effect of ATP as a cofactor in protein kinase C phosphorylation events, the production of the variably phosphorylated phosphoinositides, or the transfer of phospholipids to the cell membrane (48Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Other ATP-dependent steps have to be considered as well.In conclusion, the findings presented demonstrate that the methylated and presumably more mitochondrial-permeable derivative of pyruvate stimulates the calcium-dependent activation of islet PLC and insulin release. Whereas the stimulatory actions of 20 mM MP on first-phase insulin secretion were comparable to 20 mM glucose, the effects of MP on sustained secretion were significantly less. MP induces TDP of release, a characteristic it shares in common with a variety of structurally distinct molecules linked by their ability to activate PLC directly or the enzyme protein kinase C (13Zawalich W.S. Diabetologia. 1988; 31: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Zawalich W.S. Diaz V.A. Zawalich K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C.

The judicious use of MP may prove to be a valuable tool in defining the nature of the biochemical factors and transduction pathways that interact so elegantly to regulate insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell. INTRODUCTIONThe regulation of fuel-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells depends upon the intermediary metabolism of these compounds via several established metabolic pathways (1Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Hutton J.C. Metabolism. 1979; 28: 373-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In addition to glucose, mannose, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone, which are metabolized initially by cytosolic glycolytic enzymes (2Ashcroft S.J. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 3Hellman B. Idahl L.A. Lernmark A. Sehlin J. Taljedal I.B. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1977; 252: 8519-8523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a variety of insulinotropic nutrient molecules are metabolized solely within the mitochondria. These include among others leucine, monomethylsuccinate, and α-ketoisocaproate (6Malaisse W.J. Hutton J.C. Carpinelli A.R. Herchuelz A. Sener A. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Mertz R.J. Rana R.S. Arch. Biochem.

Because these latter stimulants for insulin secretion share in common many of the same stimulatory features of glucose on the beta cell, the concept that mitochondrial-derived signals mediate, at least in part, the stimulatory actions of the hexose has been proposed (11MacDonald M.J. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Malaisse W.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For example, both glucose and α-ketoisocaproate stimulate similar changes in insulin secretion and the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of islet phosphoinositide (PI) 1The abbreviations used are:PIphosphoinositideMPmethyl pyruvateKRBKrebs-Ringer bicarbonatePLCphospholipase CIPinositol phosphateTDPtime-dependent potentiation. pools and sensitize the beta cells to subsequent restimulation, a phenomenon also referred to as priming or time-dependent potentiation (TDP) (13Zawalich W.S. Diabetologia. 1988; 31: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Best L. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Zawalich W.S. Diaz V.A. Zawalich K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254PubMed Google Scholar).Standing at odds with this unifying concept, implicating the importance of mitochondrial signals in the regulation of secretion regardless of the nutrient molecule used, are studies with pyruvate. Although it seems to be well metabolized, pyruvate alone has no insulinotropic effect, although in combination with stimulatory glucose, a small stimulatory action has been described (16Sener A. Kawazu S. Hutton J.C. Boschev A.C. Devis G. Somers G. Herchuelz A. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Most recently, the methylated derivative of pyruvate has been reported to augment the release of insulin from the beta cells of cultured mouse islets (17Mertz R.J. Worley J.F. Spencer B. Johnson J.H. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4838-4845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, methylation seems to confer upon pyruvate stimulatory actions not inherent in the unaltered pyruvate molecule. This situation is similar to the effects of methylation on the succinate molecule, which alone has no insulinotropic effect but when methylated now exhibits many of the same stimulatory characteristics as glucose (7MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Mertz R.J. Rana R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 649-654PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Cline G. Shulman G. Rasmussen H. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 843-850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably methylation renders succinate, and perhaps pyruvate as well, more membrane-permeable and allows higher levels of the compound to be achieved and acted upon by mitochondrial enzymes. In the present series of studies we explored in more detail the effects of methyl pyruvate (MP) on the beta cell. The dose dependence and calcium dependence of the insulinotropic effects of MP, the kinetics of insulin secretion from freshly isolated and perifused rat islets, as well as the ability of MP to influence PI hydrolysis in [3H]inositol-prelabeled islets were determined. The findings support the view that mitochondrial metabolism of methyl pyruvate is an event sufficient to generate the necessary metabolic and second messenger molecules to activate the beta cell insulin-secretory apparatus in a manner comparable in some regards to that seen with glucose. From a quantitative perspective, however, the maximal effects of MP on second-phase release from rat islets are significantly less than those observed with equimolar glucose."

The amount of class II molecules located in these intracellular compartments can differ to a considerable extent, depending on the cell type (20Humbert M. Raposo G. Cosson P. Reggio H. Davoust J.

Recycling of class II molecules, from the plasma membrane through endosomes, has also been observed in B cells (27Harding C.V. Roof R.W. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 375: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). MHC class II molecules can therefore gain access to the antigen-processing compartments by at least two different routes, a direct targeting of newly synthesized αβ-Ii complexes and an indirect targeting of resident αβ heterodimers. These two pathways of antigen presentation coexist in B cells. One is sensitive to protein synthesis and membrane transport inhibitors (31Adorini L. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Fuchs S.

In B lymphocytes, the most efficient pathway of antigen uptake is mediated by the BCR (reviewed in Ref. 35Lanzavecchia A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 773-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Upon BCR ligation, antigens are internalized independently of a phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motives present on the cytoplasmic tail of the coreceptors Igα and Igβ molecules (36Patel K.J. Neuberger M.S. Cell. 1993; 74: 939-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ligation of the BCR transduces activation signals, through the Igα and Igβ coreceptors, leading to a cascade of protein tyrosine kinase activation (reviewed in Refs. 37DeFranco A.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 377-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and 38Pleiman C.M. D'Ambrosio D. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 393-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and to the production of second messengers, such as inositol triphosphate, and PKC activators, such as diacylglycerol (39Chen Z.Z. Coggeshall K.M. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2300-2304PubMed Google Scholar). Several routes dependent on protein tyrosine kinase and PKC are then converging at the level of the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (40Kawauchi K. Lazarus A.H. Sanghera J.S. Man G.L.P. Pelech S.L. Delovitch T.L. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Since the BCR delivers signals leading to PKC activation (37DeFranco A.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 377-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 41Scholl P.R. Geha R.S. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it was of interest to analyze the effects of BCR cross-linking and of direct PKC activation, through phorbol ester, on the biosynthetic transport and the function of MHC class II molecules. Our results show that different mechanisms of PKC activation decreased the endosomal degradation of MHC class II associated Ii chains and induced an intracellular accumulation of p12 Ii protein fragments previously identified in MHC class II-Ii transfectants (20Humbert M. Raposo G. Cosson P. Reggio H. Davoust J. Salamero J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3158-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and equivalent to the p10 Ii protein fragment SLIP (23Amigorena S.

Immunol. 1989; 24: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is correlated with a selective modulation of antigen presentation, and a regulation of vesicular traffic as shown for the uptake of transferrin (43Schonhorn J.E. Akompong T. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3698-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Anti-Ii rabbit polyclonal Abs were raised against synthetic peptides of the cytoplasmic and CLIP domain of the mouse Ii (αCyt.Ii and αCLIP). Anti-MHC class II rabbit polyclonal Ab was raised against cytoplasmic domains of the mouse I-Aβ molecule (αCyt.IAβ). The corresponding amino acid sequences of the peptides used for immunization were: M1DDQRDLISNHEQLPILGNRPREPESRCSRY31, YR77MKLPKSAKPVSQMRMATPLLMRPMSMDNMLLG109, and YH222RSQKGPRGPPPAGLLQ238 for the αCyt.Ii, αCLIP, and αCyt.IAβ respectively. Peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a protein carrier with the cross-linker bisdiazobenzidine. The biochemical characterization of αCLIP and αCyt.IAβ Abs was previously performed (44Miyazaki T. Wolf P. Tourne S. Waltzinger C. Dierich A. Barois N. Ploegh H. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1996; 84: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The rabbit antiserum αCyt.Ii was conjugated to the NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for double staining with other rabbit antiserum. The mouse hybridoma 10.2.16 producing an I-Ak-specific mAb was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The rabbit antiserum against luminal domain of human Ii (αLum.Ii), the mouse anti-lgp110-B mAb GL2A7 (45Granger B.L. Green S.A. Gabel C.A. Howe C.L. Mellman I. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12036-12043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the mouse anti-Golgi apparatus mAb CTR433 (46Jasmin B.J. Cartaud J. Bornens M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7218-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Drs. Salamero, Amigorena, and Bornens (Curie Institute, Paris) respectively. The secondary reagents (donkey anti-mouse Igs, anti-rabbit Igs, and streptavidin) coupled to FITC, Texas Red, or Cyanine 5 suitable for multiple labeling experiments and unlabeled donkey anti-mouse Igs to cross-link the BCR were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Human transferrin (Sigma) was conjugated to FITC and purified on G25 column. PMA and leupeptin were from Sigma and ICN respectively. The F6 B cell lymphoma was derived from the M12C3 B cell line, I-A negative, transfected for expression of I-Ak molecules (47Wade W.F. Chen Z.Z. Maki R. McKercher S. Palmer E. Cambier J.C. Freed J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the B lymphoma, the CH27 cell line used in antigen presentation experiments expressed H-2k molecules (48Pennell C.A. Arnold L.W.

J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 1077-1079PubMed Google Scholar) and the TS12 T cell hybridoma (50Lorenz R.G. Tyler A.N. Allen P.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 4124-4128PubMed Google Scholar) are both I-Ak-restricted and specific for HEL 46-61 and RNase A 43-56 peptides, respectively. Cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco' modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 20 μMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1 mM glutamine. F6 cells cultured to 75% confluence on glass coverslips were treated or untreated with 50 ng/ml PMA or with 100 μM leupeptin. Cells were fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing, cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.05% saponin, then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with primary Abs diluted in PBS containing 0.05% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin. Unbound Abs were removed by washing in the same medium, then cells were incubated for 30 min with secondary labeled Abs. After washing in PBS and distilled water, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Mowiol plus 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma). For double immunofluorescence using two rabbit antisera, the first staining was performed with the first primary Ab followed by the secondary labeled Ab as described above. The cells were then incubated with rabbit preimmune serum, washed, and post-fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde before being incubated for 30 min with the second primary antibody coupled to biotin. The cells were then rinsed and labeled with FITC or Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin. To label the endosomal compartments, FITC-coupled transferrin was endocytosed for 20 min, or surface Igs were cross-linked with anti-Ig Ab for 30 min at 37°C, just before fixation and multiple labeling of other internal molecules. Confocal microscopy was performed using the Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy TCS 4D (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg Germany) interfaced with an argon/krypton ion laser and with fluorescence filters and detectors allowing to record simultaneously FITC, Texas Red, and Cyanine 5 markers. For the visualization of triple labeling, we have avoided the combination of red, green, and blue that produces too many hues leading to color interpretation problems. Instead, we defined a fluorescence threshold of 10% with an image processing program that automatically draws a black line around FITC-positive structures; the black contours are then superimposed to the conventional red-green pseudocolor look-up table representing the Texas Red and Cyanine 5 fluorescent markers (from D. Demandolx, CIML, Marseille). F6 cells were either untreated or treated with 100 μM leupeptin, with 50 ng/ml PMA, or with 10 μg/ml donkey anti-Ig Ab to cross-link the BCR for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM iodoacetamide, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). Half of the lysate was directly charged on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Separated proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Ii and Ii fragments containing intact cytoplasmic tail were detected with the αCyt.Ii Ab. The second half of the lysate was incubated for 2 h with 10.2.16 mAb bound to the protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Then immunoprecipitates were washed, and pellets were suspended in reducing sample buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 33% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol). Immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS and run on 15% SDS-PAGE. After transferring onto membrane, proteins were blotted with αLum.Ii, αCyt.Ii, or αCLIP Abs. After washing, membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit Ab conjugated to horseradish peroxydase (Jackson Immunoresearch). Labeled proteins were detected using the ECL immunodetection kit (Amersham Corp.). F6 cells were washed twice and incubated for 45 min at 37°C in cysteine/methionine-free RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). In 3 ml of this medium containing 5% dialyzed FCS, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 0.6 mCi of [35S]cysteine/methionine in the presence or in the absence of 50 ng/ml PMA. When indicated, pulse-labeled cells were chased for different periods at 37°C in RPMI medium containing cold cysteine and methionine with or without PMA. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer previously described. Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads, and the supernatants were mixed with αCyt.Ii Ab or 10.2.16 mAb previously bound to protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed and pellets were resuspended in reducing sample buffer. To detect SDS-stable αβ dimers, immunoprecipitates were left at room temperature 1 h before being resolved on 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were intensified and revealed by autoradiography. F6 and CH27 antigen-presenting cells (APC) were untreated or treated with 50 ng/ml PMA for 1 h then washed. Cells were pulsed with various doses of HEL and RNase A for 2 h. After extensive washing, 5·104 APCs were cocultured for 24 h at 37°C with 105 3A9 or 105 TS12 T cell hybridomas. Interleukin-2 production in culture supernatants was measured using thiazolyl blue 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-xy)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (Sigma) to evaluate the growth of the interleukin-2-dependent CTLL-2 cell line. To determine whether B cell activation influenced the accumulation of Ii and of class II molecules into specialized intracellular compartments, we used confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence labeling of I-Ak and Ii molecules in F6 B lymphoma cells. In untreated cells, MHC class II molecules labeled with αCyt.IAβ polyclonal Ab were localized mainly at the cell surface (Fig. 1A). Ii chain visualized with αCyt.Ii polyclonal Ab gave mostly a reticulated intracellular staining consistent with the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1B). After cross-linking of the surface Igs, MHC class II molecules appeared in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 1C, arrows) colocalized with Ii (Fig. 1D, arrows). A similar colocalization of MHC class II and Ii was found in PMA-treated cells (Fig. 1, E and F, arrows). The presence in class II-rich compartments of Ii proteins and Ii degradation fragments was reported in human B cell lines (22Peters P.J. Raposo G. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Leijendekker R.L. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and in murine B lymphoma cells treated with the leupeptin protease inhibitor (23Amigorena S. Webster P. Drake J. Newcomb J. Cresswell P. Mellman I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1729-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To visualize the subcellular distribution and the processing of Ii molecules in PMA (Fig. 2B)- and in leupeptin (Fig. 2A)-treated cells, we double labeled the cells with rabbit αCyt.Ii and αLum.Ii Abs. A set of vesicles was found to contain colocalized luminal and cytoplasmic Ii epitopes, likely from full length Ii proteins (Fig. 2, A and B, yellow vesicles), while many peripheral vesicles were labeled with the αCyt.Ii Ab only (Fig. 2, A and B, red vesicles). These vesicles contain only short Ii fragments lacking their luminal domains. Since distinct vesicular compartments contained different forms of Ii, it was of importance to localize Ii fragments with respect to Golgi, lysosomal, and endosomal markers in PMA-treated cells. The mouse Golgi CTR433 mAb which recognizes a marker present in the Golgi complex (46Jasmin B.J. Cartaud J. Bornens M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7218-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), was partially colocalized with the αLum.Ii (Fig. 2C, yellow vesicles) and weakly colocalized with αCyt.Ii labeling (Fig. 2D). Some vesicles positive for the αLum.Ii Ab and many peripheral vesicles, containing Ii degradation products recognized by the αCyt.Ii Ab, were not coincident with this Golgi marker (Fig. 2, C and D, red vesicles). Next, to identify the lysosomal compartments, we used a mAb directed against the lgp110-B marker (45Granger B.L. Green S.A. Gabel C.A. Howe C.L. Mellman I. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12036-12043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and found no superimposition of the αCyt.Ii Ab after PMA treatment (Fig. 2E), suggesting that Ii fragments do not reach or do not persist in the lysosomes (51Xu X.X. Song W.X. Cho H. Qiu Y. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2984-2992PubMed Google Scholar). Since antigens bound to the BCR are transported to peptide-loading compartments for processing and presentation by the MHC class II molecules (35Lanzavecchia A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 773-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), it was of importance to determine whether the BCR could reach vesicles containing the different forms of Ii. Internalization of the BCR was triggered by cross-linking with anti-Ig Ab in PMA-treated cells. The anti-Ig Ab internalized for 0.5 h were highly colocalized with peripheral vesicles containing cytoplasmic Ii fragments (Fig. 2F). To further define the intracellular localization of Ii degradation products with respect to the early endosomes in activated cells, FITC-coupled transferrin was internalized through its receptor during PMA treatment. The cells were then fixed and processed for double immunofluorescence staining with the αLum.Ii and αCyt.Ii Abs. We found a limited level of colocalization between the early endosomes loaded with FITC-transferrin and the Ii positive vesicles labeled with the αCyt.Ii Ab (Fig. 2G, yellow vesicles). To determine whether the Ii-positive early endosomes contained also the luminal Ii epitope, we used an image processing program to surround FITC-transferrin-positive structures above a fluorescence value of 10% with black contours. These contours were then superimposed on the double fluorescence image obtained with αLum.Ii and αCyt.Ii Abs (Fig. 2H). This representation shows triple positive vesicles as double labeled objects surrounded with black contours. Some early endosomes contain the two Ii epitopes (Fig. 2H, yellow vesicles with black contours), while only a few contain short Ii cytoplasmic fragments (Fig. 2H, red vesicles with black contours). We think that newly synthesized MHC class II-Ii complexes bearing unprocessed Ii chains gain access to early endosomal compartments. PKC activation also generates Ii fragments that are colocalized with internalized surface Igs in later elements of the endosomal pathway (Fig. 2F). The cytoplasmic Ii fragments identified in endosomal compartments after PKC activation are probably equivalent to cytoplasmic derived SLIP Ii protein fragment associated with intracellular class II molecules (23Amigorena S. Webster P. Drake J. Newcomb J. Cresswell P. Mellman I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1729-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 42Nguyen Q.V. Knapp W. Humphreys R.E. Hum. Immunol. 1989; 24: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and to the p12 Ii fragments identified in αβ-Ii-transfected fibroblasts (20Humbert M. Raposo G. Cosson P. Reggio H. Davoust J. Salamero J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3158-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we performed Western blotting with αCyt.Ii, αLum.Ii, and αCLIP antisera in total cell lysates from leupeptin (100 μM)- and PMA (50 ng/ml)-treated cells (Fig. 3A, lanes L and P, respectively). The αCyt.Ii polyclonal Ab recognized the p10, p12, p31, and to a lesser extent the p41 forms of Ii in the total cell lysate. After leupeptin or PMA treatment, there was no change in the amount of p10 and p31 Ii forms; however, a slight increase in the p12 Ii form was detected in PMA treated cells (Fig. 3A). Since Ii is produced in excess compared to class II molecules, we identified also I-Ak-associated Ii proteins on Western blots after immunoprecipitation with the nonconformational 10.2.16 anti-I-Ak mAb (Fig. 3B). Compared to the controls, no change occurred for p31 and p41 Ii forms associated with class II molecules; however, PMA and leupeptin treatments increased the class II-associated p12 Ii fragments, revealed with rabbit αCyt.Ii and αCLIP Abs (Fig. 3B, lanes L and P). The cytoplasmic derived p10 Ii fragments identified in the total cell lysates do not bind to class II molecules (Fig. 3, A and B). In another set of experiments, we compared the effect of PMA treatment and BCR ligation (Fig. 4, lanes P and B) on the pattern of MHC class II-associated Ii fragments revealed with the αCyt.Ii Ab (Fig. 4A) and the αCLIP Ab (Fig. 4B). Both PKC activation pathways increased the level of association of p12 Ii fragments with class II molecules (Fig. 4, A and B).Fig. 4Induction of MHC class II molecule-associated Ii fragments in response to PKC activation. The F6 cells were untreated (lanes C), treated with PMA (lanes P) or with anti BCR Ab for 1 h (lanes B). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-I-Ak mAb before being resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred and blotted with αCyt.Ii (panel A) or with αCLIP (panel B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether PKC activation modified Ii turnover, we performed a 35S pulse-chase labeling followed by SDS-PAGE analysis of Ii products immunoprecipitated with the αCyt.Ii Ab. In untreated cells, Ii was rapidly degraded and a p12 Ii fragment appeared after 30 min of 35S pulse (Fig. 5A) analog to SLIP. Faint p10 Ii fragments were detected after 2 h of chase, and most of the p31 and p41 Ii forms were degraded within 3 h. In cells treated with PMA, degradation of Ii was consistently reduced with more p12 fragment at 2 h and more p31 form at 3 h of chase compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 5A).

The four rRNA genes of the rodent malaria parasite, P. berghei, form two classes of 2 units that are genetically unlinked and termed A-type and S-type. Through Northern analysis and in situ hybridization, expression of the units was demonstrated in synchronized parasite preparations covering the developmental pathway from the initiation of the blood-stage asexual cycle to the production of mature ookinetes. A-type units were transcribed in direct response to cell growth in bloodstage asexual parasites yet were differentially regulated during male (inactive) and female (active) gametocytogenesis. S-type expression was not confined solely to the mosquito stages and exhibited a finite period of expression in a subset of bloodstage trophozoites that was significantly elevated in gametocyte-producing parasites. Unlike in the human parasite, P. falciparum, there was no evidence for accumulation of precursor forms of the S-type transcripts in gametocytes. No significant rRNA transcription was observed in cultured, fertilized ookinetes until ∼20 h of development when S-type transcription was initiated. The results further demonstrate that in Plasmodium the expression of the different rRNA units is linked to developmental progression but in a species-specific manner.

The exceptional pattern of transcription of these genes was initially discovered in the rodent parasite, Plasmodium berghei, where it was broadly demonstrated that the asexual blood stages transcribe the A-type units, whereas the S-type units are transcribed in the mosquito stages of the parasite, including the sporozoite (2Gunderson J.H. Sogin M.L. Wollett G. Hollingdale M. de la Cruz V.F. Waters A.P. McCutchan T.F. Science. 1987; 238: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A similar pattern of rRNA unit transcription has been confirmed for every species of Plasmodium investigated (3McCutchan T.F. de la Cruz V.F. Lal A.A. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.L. Sogin M.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 28: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 4Waters A.P. Higgins D.G. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 914-923PubMed Google Scholar, 5Li J. Wirtz R.A. McConkey G.A. Sattabongkot J. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Subsequent work in different parasite species demonstrated that the switches in rRNA unit transcription were linked to parasite development associated with transitions between the vector and host. Thus, it was shown in the human parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, that the switch from A- to S-type transcription occurred during gametocytogenesis and zygote formation and involved accumulation of S-type rRNA precursor forms (6Waters A.P. Syin C. McCutchan T.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 438-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In P. berghei, the switch back to A-type transcription occurred early in the liver stages following invasion of cultured hepatocytes by sporozoites (7Zhu J. Waters A.P. Appiah A. McCutchan T.F. Lal A.A. Hollingdale M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12740-12744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work in Plasmodium vivax has shown that the transition to S-type rRNA occurred much later in the period of development within the mosquito, at the point in oocyst development when sporozoites were being formed and contrasting with the observations in P. falciparum (5Li J. Wirtz R.A. McConkey G.A. Sattabongkot J. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Lately, a third type of developmentally regulated nuclear rRNA gene has been demonstrated in P. vivax, a finding that may prompt a re-evaluation of all previous data. Termed O-type, their transcription was first detectable in ookinetes, and their period of maximum transcription was in oocysts separating those of the A- and S-types. O-type genes are structurally significantly different from both the A- and S-type. Transcripts of the O-type appeared to be confined to the oocyst structure and were not detected in salivary gland sporozoites. 1J. Li and T. F. McCutchan, unpublished observations cited in Ref. 1McCutchan T.F. Li J. McConkey G.A. Rogers M.J. Waters A.P. Parasitol. Today. 1995; 11: 134-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar. These observations and the fact that the O-type has not yet been demonstrated in P. berghei indicated that there may be species-specific features of the switch and the types of genes involved. The four rRNA units in the nuclear genome of P. berghei are currently divided into two pairs representing the A-type (A and B units) and S-type (C and D units)(8, 9), which somewhat simplifies analysis. We present here a description of the steady-state transcriptional activity of these stage-specific units through the use of probes directed against the relatively rapidly evolving A and C unit external transcribed spacer (ETS) 2The abbreviations used are: ETSexternal transcribed spacerSSUsmall subunit; LSU large subunitPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s)ntnucleotide(s)hpihours post invasion. regions. We found that transcription of the P. berghei nuclear rRNA genes was also developmentally regulated. Specific and unexpected periods of rDNA unit transcription were observed, demonstrating a complex pattern of transcriptional regulation that could be linked to the various differentiation pathways of the parasite. external transcribed spacer small subunit; LSU large subunit polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s) nucleotide(s) hours post invasion. The following cloned lines of the ANKA strain of P. berghei were used in this study: 8417 (gametocyte producer); clone 2.34 (producer); 8458 (low producer); and clone 2.33 (nonproducer). In addition, the nonproducer clone 1 of the K173 strain was used (10Paton M.G. Barker G.C. Matsuoka H. Ramesar J. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Sinden R.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Synchronous asexual blood stages were obtained from infections in rats that were synchronized as has been described (11Janse C.J. Mons B. Croon J.J.A.B. van der Kaay H.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 1984; 14: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Janse C.J. Boorsma E.G. Ramesar J. Grobbee M.J. Mons B. Int. J.

Parasites synchronized in this way typically have a window of development no greater than 3 h. Blood containing ring forms was collected from the rats, and leukocytes were removed as described and incubated under standard in vitro culture conditions (11Janse C.J. Mons B. Croon J.J.A.B. van der Kaay H.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 1984; 14: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) for 21-24 h to allow the development of the rings into mature schizonts. From these cultures, samples were taken at the appropriate time points for RNA extraction (see below). Immature gametocytes were purified from blood collected from rats with synchronous infections as described (14Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Parasitol. Today. 1995; 11: 138-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These immature gametocytes were incubated for a period of 6 h under standard culture conditions (11Janse C.J. Mons B. Croon J.J.A.B. van der Kaay H.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 1984; 14: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) for complete maturation. The purified gametocyte preparation consisted of 95% male and female gametocytes in a 1:1 ratio mixed with 5% mature schizonts and ring forms. Zygotes and ookinetes were obtained from in vitro cultures as described (15Janse C.J. Mons B. Rouwenhorst R.J. van der Klooster P.F.J. Overdulve J.P. van der Kaay H.J. Parasitology. 1985; 91: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study, we used two different sources of gametocytes to start the cultures: 1) purified gametocytes, which were collected as described above (in these cultures, normally 50-70% of the females were fertilized, and there was a 5% schizont contamination (10Paton M.G. Barker G.C. Matsuoka H. Ramesar J. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Sinden R.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)); and 2) infected blood obtained from mice with a high proportion of gametocytes (16Janse C.J. Rouwenhorst R.J. van der Klooster P.F.J. van der Kaay H.J. Overdulve J.P. Parasitology. 1985; 91: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). From this material, ookinete smears were prepared for in situ hybridization or were purified from unfertilized gametes, young gametocytes, and trophozoites by density gradient centrifugation, resulting in ookinete preparations consisting of mature ookinetes, uninfected cells, and ring forms. RNA was prepared from purified parasites as reported previously (10Paton M.G. Barker G.C. Matsuoka H. Ramesar J. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Sinden R.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). RNA was fractionated in formaldehyde containing agarose gels and blotted to nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Corp.) according to standard protocols (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1989; Google Scholar). The four rRNA gene units of P. berghei were originally defined as A-D according to their size upon digestion of genomic DNA with EcoRI (8Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6984-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This definition has survived the discovery of the specific developmental transcription of the different units, which are now defined as A (sexual vertebrate host), S (porozoite), and more recently, O (ocyst). This work confirms what was evident from the early restriction mapping that the four units form two groups of two units, currently termed A and S, and the individual units will continue to be referred to as A, B, C, and D. As discussed, it is not yet possible to distinguish between the C and D units, although restriction analysis (8Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6984-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 8: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and preliminary sequence data 3R. M. L. v. Spaendonk, unpublished data. indicate that this should be possible. The S units may yet have to be further redefined into an O and S type. New probes generated during the course of this study are referred by numerical designation according to use in the laboratory with lettering A or S according to the type of unit they were derived from and detect. The probes were derived by subcloning or PCR amplification from the following two genomic DNA clones that have been described previously (8Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6984-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dame J.B. Sullivan M. McCutchan T.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A-unit probes were derived from clone pPbS5.6 (8Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6984-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a 5.6-kilobase pair EcoRI/HindIII fragment of P. berghei genomic DNA, which contains the A-unit SSU gene and 3.0-kb of upstream sequence. S-unit probes were derived from clone pPbSL8.8 (19Dame J.B. Sullivan M. McCutchan T.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), an 8.8-kb EcoRI/HindIII fragment of the C P. berghei genomic DNA that contains part of the C-unit LSU gene, the 5.8S gene, the SSU, and ∼1 kb of sequence upstream of the SSU. These clones and the regions used in this study as probes are illustrated in Fig. 1. Oligonucleotides used in the PCR amplification reactions were: 365R, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GAG ATC AAC CAG GTT-3′, which corresponds in an antisense fashion to the 5′ end of the mature 18 S unit of the A and C rDNA units but also includes the T7 RNA promoter for the optional generation of antisense RNA probes (this was used for the amplification of ETS probes from both the A and C units); 38A, 5′-TAT GCA TCA TAA TAA AGA-3′, which corresponds in a sense fashion to position −395 with respect to the 18 S gene of the A unit 4A. P. Waters, R. M. L. v. Spaendonk, J. Ramesar, R. A. W. Vervenne, R. W. Dirks, J. Thompson, and C. J. Janse, unpublished data. and when used with 365R, generated the 101A probe of 438 nt; and PUC R reverse sequencing primer, 5′-AGC GGA TAA CAA TTT CAC ACA GGA-3′, was used with 365R to amplify 99S, an ∼1-kb probe containing sequences homologous to the C unit ETS region. PCR conditions were 4 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 40°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 25 similar cycles but with an elevated annealing temperature of 54°C. The Taq polymerase used in these studies was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The antisense oligonucleotides TM4 and TM3 are specific for the A- and S-type SSU rRNA, genes, respectively and have been described before (2Gunderson J.H. Sogin M.L. Wollett G. Hollingdale M. de la Cruz V.F. Waters A.P. McCutchan T.F. Science. 1987; 238: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Final wash conditions for these probes was at Tm (melting temperature) −5°C in 3 × SSC, 0.5% SDS (1 × SSC is 0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M sodium citrate). Clone 315A is an EcoRI/NsiI subclone from pPbs5.6 (18Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 8: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) encompassing 2.6 kilobase pairs of the region upstream of the mature SSU A unit (Fig. 1). The clone of the P. falciparum A-type SSU rRNA gene has been described before (3McCutchan T.F. de la Cruz V.F. Lal A.A. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.L. Sogin M.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 28: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Probes 104S and 105A are PCR-generated probes specific for the internal transcribed spacer region 1 of the C and A units, respectively, and are shown in Fig. 1. Final wash conditions for all complex probes was 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65°C. Templates containing a 3′ T7 RNA polymerase initiation site for the synthesis of antisense RNA probes by in vitro transcription were generated by two rounds of PCR amplification as follows. A template for the transcription of a P. berghei rRNA-specific probe was generated by amplification of a 190-nucleotide fragment of clone pPbS5.6, containing P. berghei A SSU rRNA, using the 5′ primer CTTAACCTGCTAATTAGC in conjunction with the 3′ primer GACTCACTATAGGGCCACCGTTCCTCTAAG, which includes 15 nucleotides corresponding to the T7 RNA polymerase initiation site. PCR amplification was carried out in the presence of the 3′ primer alone for 5 cycles at 94°C for 1 min; 36°C for 1 min; and 72°C for 1 min; then, in the presence of both primers, for 30 cycles at an annealing temperature of 48°C. To complete the T7 RNA polymerase initiation site and add 10 bp of protecting sequence, a second round of amplification was carried out under the same conditions, using 0.5 μl of the first amplification reaction mix in the presence of the same 5′ primer and the 3′ primer ACAAGCTTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC. A template for the transcription of a P. berghei rRNA S-ETS-specific probe was generated in the same way by amplification of a 246-bp fragment of the C-unit ETS region within clone pPbSL8.8 in the presence of the 5′ primer ATTCACTTCCGTAATTTG and, during the first round of amplification, the 3′ primer GACTCACTATAGGGCTCATTTACCGTGATC. The annealing temperatures during the first round of amplification were 5 cycles at 32°C and 30 cycles at 42°C, and during the second round were 5 cycles at 36°C and 30 cycles at 46°C. A template for the transcription of a P. berghei rRNA A-ETS-specific probe was generated by amplification of a 438-bp fragment of the A-ETS region within clone pPbS5.6 in the presence of primers 365R and 38R as described above. Chromosomes of the different strains and clones of P. berghei were fractionated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon, and hybridized using conditions described previously (20Ponzi M. Janse C.J. Dore E. Scotti R. Pace T. Reterink T.J.F. van der Berg F.M. Mons B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 41: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The methodologies describing the preparation of P. berghei parasites and suitable RNA and DNA probes for in situ RNA hybridization and their application have been described thoroughly elsewhere (21Thompson J. Sinden R.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Vervenne R. Dirks R. Ramesar J. Waters A.P. Janse C.J. Mol. Biochem.

Genet. 1995; 4: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled either through the direct incorporation of fluorescein-UTP or the incorporation of digoxigenin-UTP/dUTP as appropriate and detection with fluorochrome-linked specific antibodies. All chemicals and reagents for these processes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. The method of visualization used to generate the data shown is indicated in the text and figure legends. The reader is referred to “Materials and Methods” for the definition of the RNA units. The ETS regions of the A and C rRNA units were isolated from the genomic clones described previously (18Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 8: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by a combination of PCR and subcloning procedures. These and other probes used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1, which is a schematic representation of the A and C units showing the gene units and the ETS and internal transcribed spacer regions (adapted from Ref. 19Dame J.B. Sullivan M. McCutchan T.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These probes were used to establish the chromosomal location and sequence type of the units and their patterns of transcription in the various stages of the life cycle reported here. A probe for the small subunit rRNA gene hybridized to chromosomes 5, 6, 7, and 12, showing that the four rRNA units are unlinked in the genome. The A-type ETS probes (101A and 315) hybridized only to chromosomes 7 and 12, whereas the S-type ETS probe (99S) hybridized to chromosomes 5 and 6 (Fig. 2). This demonstrated that probes directed against the ETS regions of the A and C units were type specific, consistent with the observed similarity of respective restriction maps of the four units (8Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6984-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 11: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The sequence of these regions will be the subject of another report that identifies and characterizes the transcription start site of the rRNA gene units. 5R. M. L. van Spaendonk, G. A. McConkey, T. F. McCutchan, C. J. Janse, and A. P. Waters, manuscript in preparation. The internal transcribed spacer region 1 probes (Fig. 1) have the same A- or S-type specificity (data not shown). The typical rDNA unit is transcribed as a single large primary transcript, which is then processed through a series of characteristic steps to generate the three mature rRNA species of SSU rRNA (∼2050 nt for Plasmodium), 5.8S (∼155 nt), and the (naturally nicked in P. berghei) LSU rRNA (∼800 and 3000 nt)(8, 18). The ETS probes used in this study will, therefore, detect the primary transcript, and any secondary processed precursor species that contain the ETS but will not hybridize directly to the mature rRNA species. The Northern and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated that the ETS probes hybridized only to precursor rRNA species and that these were confined to the nucleus (Fig. 3). The processing of rRNA precursor transcripts is a rapid process, and the RNA species have extremely short half-lives. Nuclear run-on analyses using blood-stage parasites confirmed that the A-type units are actively transcribed in these cell types (data not shown). Probes detecting these intermediates could, therefore, be used to measure steady-state rRNA unit transcription. This was performed using synchronous populations of distinct clones of P. berghei, which either could or could not produce gametocytes. Four time points were investigated representing each of the morphologically distinct phases of the asexual blood-stage cycle (5 hpi, consisting of ring stages/young trophozoites; 16 hpi, old trophozoites; 25 hpi, mature schizonts/young gametocytes; and 28hpi, mature schizonts/mature gametocytes). RNA from equivalent numbers of parasites were loaded in each lane, which was quantitated by hybridization of an oligonucleotide (TM4) to the mature SSU rRNA species. In the gametocyte-producing clone (8417), the A-type units were transcribed throughout the asexual cycle, and the production of two major precursor species of 2700 and 2900 nt was observed hybridizing to probe 101A (Fig. 3A). A faint band of ∼7.0 kb also hybridized to 101A and is interpreted as the size of the primary rRNA transcript of the complete unit or an early processing intermediate (data not shown). The 2900-nt precursor was only observed in the first 16 h after erythrocyte invasion, and both major precursors were equimolar during this period. However, the 2900-nt precursor was not observed during schizogony or in mature gametocytes. In the gametocyte nonproducing clone, the 2900-nt precursor is in the same parasite forms and to the same extent as in the producer clone (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1, 2, 6, and 7). However, A-type transcription was barely observable in mature schizonts (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 3, 4, 8, and 9). We conclude that the 2700-nt precursor is produced by gametocytes, and these forms are responsible for the signal observed in the schizont samples taken from the gametocyte-producing parasite clone. Mature schizonts do not, therefore, transcribe rRNA genes. This pattern of transcription was observed using both 101A or TM4 (data not shown). Preliminary data indicated that the observed precursors consisted solely of the mature SSU and ETS regions. 6R. M. L. v. Spaendonk and A. P. Waters, unpublished observations. These conclusions were confirmed and clarified by in situ hybridization of 101A to blood-stage parasites, which demonstrated that transcripts containing the ETS region were confined to the nucleus, consistent with the exclusive nuclear processing of eukaryotic rRNA primary transcripts (Fig. 3B). A-type transcription was not observed in newly invaded rings (data not shown) but was observed in all asexual mononuclear stages from 5 hpi. Furthermore, A-type transcription decreased with increasing schizont maturity and was barely detectable in fully mature schizonts (16n) and released merozoites (1n). A-type transcription in gametocytes was shown to be sex-specific. Female gametocytes continued to transcribe the A-type units, whereas the males were silent (Fig. 3B). The S-type units were transcribed in a phased manner in blood-stage parasites (Fig. 3C). S-type precursors of an estimated size of 3000 and 2650 nt, respectively were observed with a peak in production at 16 hpi, when all cells are maturing trophozoites. The same pattern of S-type precursors was observed in both gametocyte producer and nonproducer clones, although the level of transcription in the former was significantly higher (Fig. 3C). The level of S-type transcription appeared to vary between clones between 2- and 10-fold, as estimated by densitometry (Fig. 3C) and appeared to be consistently greater in producer clones. The larger precursor was more abundant than the smaller (ratio, 5:1). A third band of >10 kb was also visible, which is interpreted as being the full-length primary rRNA transcript of the complete unit comparable to the smaller >7.0kb transcript of the A-type unit. The transitory appearance of the S-type precursors indicated that they did not accumulate as steady-state precursor forms that had been observed in gametocytes of P. falciparum (4Waters A.P. Higgins D.G. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 914-923PubMed Google Scholar), nor was accumulation of the mature transcripts observed through hybridization to the S-type-specific oligonucleotide, TM3 (data not shown). Neither transcription of the S-type units nor accumulation of S-type transcripts in mature gametocytes was evident (Fig. 3C) in clone 8417 illustrated nor in rings, mature trophozoites, nor schizonts from independent nonproducer parasite clones, LK173 and 233 (see “Materials and Methods”; data not shown). ETS probe to synchronous blood-stage parasites confirmed that the peak of S-type transcription occurred at 16 hpi during trophozoite development. The peak appeared to be restricted to a subset of mononuclear cells (<1%). As in Northern analysis, neither S-type transcription nor accumulation was observed in mature gametocytes (Fig. 3D). It is not yet possible to distinguish between 16-hpi trophozoites, which will form schizonts, and those committed to sexual differentiation. Using the ETS-specific probes, A-type and S-type transcription was examined in mature gametocytes, zygotes, and developing ookinetes (Fig. 4). A-type precursors were still abundant in mature female gametocytes (Fig. 4A, right panel). After fertilization, it appeared that transcription of the A-type units rapidly decreased. In the ookinete preparations, which were derived from purified gametocytes, A-type precursors were hardly visible at 2 and 14 h after fertilization. The strong hybridization at 22 h is due to the presence in this particular preparation of ookinetes of large numbers of asexual ring forms that produce significant amounts of A-type precursors (Fig. 2B). In situ hybridization analysis confirmed that A-type transcription was down-regulated in zygotes and ookinetes during this period and that the nuclear A-type signal resulted solely from asexual parasites present in the culture (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the rapid decrease in A-type transcription, S-type transcription was up-regulated during ookinete development (Fig. 4A, left and center panels). In mature gametocytes, little if any S-type transcription was seen. S-type transcription could be detected 2 h after fertilization and dramatically increased between 14 and 24 h in the maturing ookinete. Four S-type rRNA precursor bands were observed in ookinetes, the two observed in asexual parasites (3000 and 2650 nt) and two larger forms (3900 and 3400 nt). The 2650-nt precursor was more abundant than the 3000-nt transcript in contrast to the transcription of the S-type units in the blood-stages, where the relative abundance of these two precursors was reversed (Fig. 2C). In situ hybridization analysis confirmed that the S-type transcription could be detected in the nucleus of about 10% of 20-h ookinetes and in >70% of mature (>24-h) ookinetes. S-type transcription was not detected with this method in 2-h zygotes or in 4-, 6-, 12-, and 16-h ookinetes (Fig. 4B and data not shown). The pattern of rRNA gene transcription in Plasmodium parasites is complex. This is due not only to the presence of different types of rRNA gene units (A- and S-type) that are transcribed in a stage-specific manner (2Gunderson J.H. Sogin M.L. Wollett G. Hollingdale M. de la Cruz V.F. Waters A.P. McCutchan T.F. Science. 1987; 238: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 3McCutchan T.F. de la Cruz V.F. Lal A.A. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.L.

Parasitol. 1994; 65: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) but also the presence of multiple and unlinked copies of each type. Each individual unit may be differentially transcribed during the progression of the life cycle, complicating the analysis. The pattern of transcription of the rRNA genes can be established relatively easily in the rodent model malaria parasite, P. berghei, because there are only two copies each of the A-type (the A and B units) and the S-type (the C and D units)(8), and the types can be defined by the ETS probes described here. These probes also further define the extent of pairwise homogeneity between the units. The mechanism that underlies the maintenance of this pairwise homogeneity of units on separate chromosomes involves some level of gene conversion (25Enea V. Corredor V. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 32: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), yet it must also discriminate between and maintain the different types. In Plasmodium, rapid growth periods result in the formation of relatively stable parasite forms (mature schizonts/merozoites, gametocytes, and sporozoites) that only undergo further differentiation after a specific transition, e.g. erythrocyte invasion or passage between the host and vector. The work presented here demonstrates that rRNA transcription in two of these stable forms, schizonts and male gametocytes, is down-regulated and that only the female gametocyte continued to transcribe the rRNA genes. The female gametocyte can accumulate maternal mRNA that is not translated until after fertilization (e.g. Pbs21 ookinete antigen gene (10Paton M.G. Barker G.C. Matsuoka H. Ramesar J. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Sinden R.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Thompson J. Sinden R.E. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1994; 68: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) and may, therefore, require protracted ribosome biogenesis during its development and may also accumulate ribosomes for use in the zygote, given the absence of appreciable rRNA transcription in P. berghei at that stage. Electron microscopic examination of mature male gametocytes suggested that ribosomes were undergoing visible degradation, which would be consistent with their cessation of rRNA gene transcription (26Sinden R.E. Adv. Parasitol. 1983; 22: 153-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 27Shaw M.K. Thompson J. Sinden R.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 270-276PubMed Google Scholar). The steady state pattern of A-type rRNA precursors was complex and probably cell type-specific, implying that the female gametocyte uses a different rRNA processing pathway compared to asexual blood-stage forms, even if the difference only reflects the kinetic stability of the intermediates. Alternatively, the range of rRNA precursors may reflect two specific forms of A-type transcript, one each produced by the A and B units. The currently available probes cannot discriminate between the units, which appear to be highly similar (8Dame J.B. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6984-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In most organisms, transcription of rRNA genes occurs during the growth phase of the cell (28Warner J. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 256-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This work has shown that transcription of the A-type rRNA genes of P. berghei is maximal in the rapidly growing blood-stage forms and, therefore, under a similar type of control. In addition, we have shown that at least one of the S-type units, normally mainly transcribed during oocyst growth (2Gunderson J.H. Sogin M.L. Wollett G. Hollingdale M. de la Cruz V.F. Waters A.P. McCutchan T.F. Science. 1987; 238: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), is also transcribed during the blood-stage development in a small subset of P. berghei trophozoites and to a greater extent in parasite clones that produce gametocytes. Bloodstage transcription of the S-type units may indicate a temporary requirement for S-type ribosomes during blood-stage development, implying the existence of a specific mRNA population or cell type. This subset of cells may be committed to sexual development, but in the absence of additional early markers of gametocyte development, this cannot be confirmed. Unlike the observations made in P. falciparum (4Waters A.P. Higgins D.G. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 914-923PubMed Google Scholar), however, the P. berghei blood-stage S-type transcription did not result in the accumulation of precursor forms in gametocytes; in addition, there was no evidence of mature S-type SSU rRNA in any blood-stage form. This species-specific S-type rRNA gene transcription may well reflect the marked difference in the kinetics of development and morphology of P. falciparum gametocytes (26Sinden R.E. Adv. Parasitol. 1983; 22: 153-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which take a minimum of 8 days to mature, whereas in other malaria species, gametocytogenesis is of a similar length to asexual blood-stage development. Alternatively, it is possible we observed a general transcriptional event that is so transient that at any time point of analysis, transcription appears to be limited to a subset of the synchronized populations that have a developmental window of about 4 h. The developmental timing of the switch between A- and S-type transcription in the mosquito also differs in P. vivax, where there is a lag phase between days 2 and 6 after infection where neither class of rRNA is detectable (5Li J. Wirtz R.A. McConkey G.A. Sattabongkot J. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The recent report of a third type of developmentally regulated nuclear rRNA gene transcribed during this lag phase in oocysts of P. vivax1 raises the question of whether a similar type exists in P. berghei This could only result from a subdivision of the very similar but distinguishable S-type C and D units because we have demonstrated that the A types are barely transcribed throughout the mosquito stages and are almost identical (2Gunderson J.H. Sogin M.L. Wollett G. Hollingdale M. de la Cruz V.F. Waters A.P. McCutchan T.F. Science. 1987; 238: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Characterization of the differences between the C and D units will allow this question to be addressed. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that transcription of the stage-specific rRNA genes of P. berghei is highly regulated and involves different periods of activation demonstrably linked, in the case of the A-type, to periods of cell growth. In addition to this general conventional pattern, it was observed that switching of transcriptional activity between the two different rRNA gene types was linked to the various differentiation pathways of the parasites. Superimposed upon this general pattern of transcription were transient bursts of rRNA transcription, which may yet prove to play a role in parasite differentiation (see Fig. 5 for summary of known transcription patterns of rRNA throughout the life cycle of P. berghei). The general pattern is directly analogous to the transcriptional activity of rRNA genes found in the well studied eukaryotic models. Typically, transcriptional regulation or rRNA units in these models results from different types of competitive associations of both transcriptional promoter (e.g. SL1, UBF, TBP, and REB1) and repressor proteins (e.g. Rb) with both enhancer and promoter DNA elements (29Kuhn A. Stefanovsky V. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Paule M.R. Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). These associations can be affected by the phosphorylation status of protein factors (31Liao S.-M. Zhang J. Jeffery D.A. Koleske A.J. Thompson C.M. Chao D.M. Viljoen M. van Vuuren H.J.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Additionally, the status of the chromatin and the phasing of nucleosomes in the region of the rDNA units can influence transcription (32Conconi A. Widmer R.M. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 33Dammann R. Lucchini R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All of these mechanisms may play a role in the regulation of the individual rDNA units of Plasmodium, and their interplay may then control the relative expression of each unit. The work described here implies that the general transcription of the rDNA units of Plasmodium will, however, be regulated in a similar conserved fashion to those of other eukaryotes, and the particular interest will lie in examining the supplementary mechanisms that effect the observed stage-specific control of rDNA transcription.

In this study we have used a molecular modeling-guided site-directed mutagenesis to predict the active sites in substrate binding pocket and heme environment of PGIS. A three-dimensional model of PGIS was constructed using P450BM-3 crystal structure as the template. Our results indicate that residues Ile67, Val76, Leu384, Pro355, Glu360, and Asp364, which were suggested to be located at one side of lining of the substrate binding pocket, are essential for catalytic activity. This region containing β1-1, β1-2, β1-3, and β1-4 strands is predicted well by the model. At the heme region, Cys441 was confirmed to be the proximal axial ligand of heme iron. The conserved Phe and Arg in P450BM-3 were substituted by Leu112 and Asp439, respectively in PGIS. Alteration of Leu112 to Phe retained the activity, indicating that Leu112 is a functional substitution for Phe. In contrast, mutant Asp439→ Ala exhibited a slight increase in activity. This result implies a difference in the heme region between P450BM-3 and PGIS. Our results also indicate that stability of PGIS expression is not affected by heme site or active site mutations.

It is considered to be an important vasoprotective molecule. Its biosynthesis in vascular endothelial cells is catalyzed by a series of enzymes of which PGI2 synthase (PGIS) catalyzes the final conversion of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to PGI2. PGIS was purified from bovine aortic tissues to homogeneity and the purified enzyme was characterized as a cytochrome P450 (3DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1728-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The bovine vascular PGIS cDNA is highly homologous to the human vascular enzyme. The cDNA from both species contains an open reading frame of 1500 nucleotides coding for a 500-amino acid peptide with a calculated molecular mass of about 57 kDa. Sequence comparison with known P450s shows less than 30% sequence identity between PGIS and other cytochrome P450s. Interestingly, despite similarities in enzymatic reactions, PGIS has only about a 16% sequence identity to thromboxane A2 synthase (TXAS). Thus, PGIS has been classified as a member of a new family of P450, CYP8. The active site structure of PGIS has not been delineated. On sequence comparison with P450s, we observed the conservation of several P450 structural elements in PGIS, including a putative membrane-anchoring segment, a helix I which forms an α-helix backbone through the center of the enzyme, and a heme binding pocket. This raised the possibility of mapping the active site amino acid residues by molecular modeling-guided site-directed mutagenesis. Cytochrome P450BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium catalyzes the monooxygenation of fatty acids, including arachidonic acid (AA). Its catalytic function and primary structure resemble mammalian microsomal cytochrome P450s. The heme domain of P450BM-3 shows about 25-30% sequence identity to several microsomal P450 enzymes (9Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Since AA is a functional substrate of P450BM-3, and the substrate is closely related to the substrate of TXAS and PGIS, we reasoned that the crystal structure of the hemoprotein domain could serve as a useful template for constructing a three-dimensional model of these two enzymes. The three-dimensional model of TXAS has been reported by our group (10Ruan K.-H. Milfeld K. Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and proves to be useful in identifying TXAS active site residues (11Wang L.-H. Matyevic-Aleksic N. Hsu P.-H. Ruan K.-H.

In the present study, we constructed a PGIS three-dimensional model based on the crystallographic structure of P450BM-3. From this model, we identified several amino residues potentially involved in substrate access and binding and in heme binding. To test the functional role of these residues in catalysis, we have altered these residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Results from these experiments have allowed for identifying amino acid residues in the substrate channel that are important in substrate access and binding and in interaction with heme. prostacyclin thromboxane A2 synthase prostacyclin synthase prostaglandin H2 prostaglandin F1α arachidonic acid phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase high performance liquid chromatography. COS-1 cells (ATCC CRL-1650) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. pBluescript (SK+) plasmid DNA and eukaryotic expression vector pSG5 were from Stratagene. Human lung cDNA was from CloneTech. Cell culture media and antibiotics were from either Life Technologies, Inc. or HyClone Laboratories. DEAE-dextran and pGEX-2T plasmid DNA were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, dimethyl sulfoxide, and chloroquine were from Sigma.

Linear-K preadsorbent TLC plates with silica gel (60 Å) and 250-μm thickness were from Whatman (LK6D). The strategy used for constructing the PGIS three-dimensional model followed that developed for TXAS (10Ruan K.-H. Milfeld K. Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and other mammalian P450s (12Zvelebil M.J.J.M. Wolf C.R. Sternberg M.J.E. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The strategy took into consideration six procedures: (i) sequence alignment, (ii) framework construction, (iii) loop structural determination, (iv) site-chain placement, (v) molecular docking, and (vi) energy minimization, which are briefly described below. A sequence similarity alignment was made for PGIS and the hemoprotein domain of the P450BM-3 (Fig. 1), and the main-chain conformation of PGIS was built with the Quanta-Charmm protein modeling package by transferring the crystal coordinates of P450BM-3 to the aligned components of PGIS. Thus, the conserved helices and strand framework in P450BM-3 provided the backbone section coordinates of PGIS. The backbone segments were linked to each other using a fragment searching approach (13Jones T.A. Thirup S. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 14Blundell T.L.

Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several three-dimensional structural candidates were obtained from the data base and one was chosen based on the best similarity of primary structure and the best fit of Cα distance, with a cutoff value of 0.5 Å root mean square deviation (10Ruan K.-H. Milfeld K. Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Zvelebil M.J.J.M. Wolf C.R. Sternberg M.J.E.

Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structural coordinates of the heme in PGIS was adopted directly from the x-ray structure of P450BM-3 and then fixed into the backbone structure of PGIS. The substrate, PGH2, structure was constructed, energy-minimized, and subjected to conformation search. One of the 200 conformations of the PGH2 three-dimensional structure with the best score was docked into the proposed PGIS substrate binding pocket of the constructed three-dimensional model of PGIS, which corresponded to the P450BM-3 substrate binding cavity. An energy minimization with 500 steps of steepest descent was performed for the PGIS three-dimensional structural model containing heme and PGH2 structures. After the energy minimization, some steric clashes between atoms of the model were removed, and a reasonable protein folding and the substrate in coordinate position were obtained. The full-length cDNA of PGIS was amplified by a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with two pairs of primers (I34 (CAGCCCCGCGATGGCTTG) and I37 (TGTGCACACAGAAAGCTG), outer primer set; and I35 (CATGGATCCGCGATGGCTT GGGCC) and I36 (CGAGCACGTGGATCCATC), inner primer set). Outer primer set was used for first PCR in a 60-μl reaction mixture under the cycle schedule of 95°C for 35 s, 53°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min 10 s with 2-s extension for each additional cycle for a total of 30 cycles on a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler. 0.4 μg of human lung cDNA, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega or Perkin-Elmer), 0.1 unit of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 100 nM of each primer, and buffer for Pfu DNA polymerase were used. 1 μl of the first PCR product (using outer primers) was used as template for second PCR amplification using inner primers in a 60-μl reaction mixture under the cycle schedule of 95°C for 35 s, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min 10 s with 2-s extension for each additional cycle for a total of 30 cycles. The final PCR products, which contained the full-length PGIS cDNA, were gel-purified and subcloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript. The subcloned PGIS cDNA was verified by DNA sequencing. The PGIS cDNA was subcloned into pSG5 plasmid at either BamHI or BamHI-BglII sites for transient expression in COS-1 cells. Orientations of insert were verified by both AccI and EcoRI restriction enzyme digestions. The final construct containing the full-length PGIS cDNA (pSG5-PGIS, wild-type) was verified by DNA sequencing. The following single mutants of PGIS, Ile67→ Lys, Arg72→ Glu, Arg72→ Gln, Val76→ Asp, Thr206→ Val, Leu210→ Asp, Leu213→ Glu, Pro355→ Val, Glu360→ Gly, Asp364→ Val, Leu384→ Asp, Phe476→ Val, Cys231→ Ser and Cys441→ Ser, Leu112→ Asp, Leu112→ Gly, Leu112→ Phe, Pro113→ Ala, and Asn439→ Ala, were produced according to the method described previously (17Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, a primer bearing the mutated sequence and its paired primer were used in PCR to amplify a 400-500-base pair product using pSG5-PGIS DNA as the template. The PCR products were purified with Wizard PCR prep (Promega) to get rid of primers. Purified DNA of the first PCR product was used as a mega-primer for the second PCR with a primer on the other side of the mutation. The PCR product (about 5 ng), which contained the full-length cDNA and a portion of the vector, was used as the template for the second PCR. The final products were gel-purified, restriction enzyme-digested, and subcloned into pSG5-PGIS to replace the target segment. DNA sequencing was used to verify the sequence at mutation and its surrounding region. The plasmids for transfection were prepared using Qiagen plasmid purification kits (Qiagen). To generate the expression vector for glutathione S-transferase (GST) and PGIS (GST-PGIS) fusion protein, PGIS cDNA (wild-type) was subcloned into pGEX-2T vector (pGEX-PGIS). Transformed JM105 cells containing pGEX-PGIS DNA were cultured at 37°C in 2 × YT medium to A600 = 0.8. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mM) was then added to induce protein expression, and cells were further incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Harvested cells were sonicated for 35 s and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The pellet which contained the fused GST-PGIS protein was washed with lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA) and centrifuged before being applied on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. The ∼68-kDa GST-PGIS protein was dissected out from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and electroeluted. The antibody against purified GST-PGIS was prepared in rabbits by H.T.I. Bio-products (Ramona, CA). COS-1 cells were grown to near-confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 8% bovine calf serum at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfection procedure was performed as described by Wang et al. (11Wang L.-H. Matyevic-Aleksic N. Hsu P.-H. Ruan K.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19970-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, cells were activated in fresh medium for 2 h before transfection. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), COS-1 cells were incubated in 1 ml of PBS containing DEAE-dextran (0.5 mg/ml) and DNA (5 μg/ml) for 30 min in a lamina hood. 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and chloroquine (60 μg/ml) was then added, and the cells were incubated for additional 3 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. After incubation, the cells were shocked with dimethyl sulfoxide (10%) for 2 min, and the medium was replaced with 12 ml of complete growth medium. The transfected cells were then incubated for 42-60 h. To harvest cells, COS-1 cells were scraped from the plate, pelleted by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 350 μl of PBS. The protein concentration of each sample was determined using BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Immunoblotting was performed by a procedure described previously (18Ruan K.-H. Wang L.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19483-19490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 15-20 μg of whole cells were boiled in an electrophoresis sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar) for 8-10 min before being applied to a 10% polyacrylamide minigel for electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were electrotransferred at 300-450 mA for 1 h to nitrocellulose membrane. Subsequently, the membrane was blocked with 3% non-fat milk in PBS and probed with a 1 to 1000 dilution of rabbit serum containing antibody against GST-PGIS fusion protein at 25°C for 1 h or 4°C overnight. A second antibody of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as recommended. The protein bands were visualized by incubation with either the peroxidase substrate 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Bio-Rad) or Supersignal CL-HRP substrate system (Pierce). The levels of wild-type and mutant proteins on the Western blots were scanned by densitometer as described below. The assay was performed by mixing whole cell homogenates (60-80 μg in PBS) with 5.5 μg of purified sheep PGH2 synthase (20Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided by Dr. A.-L. Tsai, and [14C]AA (10 μM) was added to the mixture in a total volume of 100 μl. After addition of [14C]AA, the tube was vortexed for the initial 30 s and incubated for 3 min. The reaction was terminated with 40 μl of methanol and 1 M citric acid (4:1, v/v). Organic products generated were extracted with 300 μl of diethyl ether twice. The organic extract which contained 92%± 2% (n = 10) of the radioactivity was concentrated under nitrogen to less than 60 μl and applied to a TLC plate. The TLC plate was chilled on ice before placing in a developing tank (on ice) in the organic phase of ethyl acetate/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/acetic acid/water (110:50:20:100, v/v/v/v; upper phase) (21Salmon J.A. Flower R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 86: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After development, the radioactive signals on the TLC plate were detected by autoradiography. PGI2 was hydrolyzed to 6-keto-PGF1α during extraction, therefore the amount of [14C]6-keto-PGF1α produced reflects the amount of PGI2 converted from PGH2. The position of 6-keto-PGF1α on TLC plate was determined by co-migration of enzymatic products of a wild-type sample and nonlabeled 6-keto-PGF1α which was visualized by iodine vapor. The radioactive signal of [14C]6-keto-PGF1α on the autoradiography was detected by using a densitometer (UMAX Vista-T630 or Epson ES-800C scanners with the Adobe Photoshop program), and the intensity of each signal was analyzed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program. Radioimmunoassay was also used to determine the catalytic activity of PGIS. Whole cell homogenate (60 μg of protein) was incubated with PGH2 (5 μM) at room temperature for 3 min, the reaction was terminated, and the organic products were extracted by the procedure described above. The organic extract was dried under nitrogen and resuspened in methanol. The extract was applied to reverse-phase HPLC as described previously (22Sanduja S.K. Mehta K. Xu X.-M. Hsu S.-M. Sanduja R.

The fractions containing 6-keto-PGF1α were collected, dried, and resuspended in methanol. 6-Keto-PGF1α contents in these extracts were measured by radioimmunoassay as described previously (23Wu K.K.

A three-dimensional model based on the crystal structure of the hemoprotein domain of P450BM-3 was constructed. Details of the PGIS model will be published elsewhere. The backbone structure of the PGIS model matched well with that of P450BM-3, especially the helical regions (data not shown). The crystal structure of P450BM-3 reveals a long binding pocket lined with mostly nonaromatic hydrophobic residues (9Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). We compared the substrate access channel of the PGIS model with that of P450BM-3 by superimposing the substrate binding pocket structure of PGIS model on that of P450BM-3 crystal structure. Residues which were predicted from the three-dimensional model to be important in substrate binding pocket and heme site are shown in Fig. 2. Along the substrate access channel of PGIS were hydrophobic residues, Ile67, Val76, Thr206, Leu210, Leu213, and Phe476, which correspond to Phe42, Tyr51, Leu181, Met185, Leu188, and Leu437 of P450BM-3 channel, respectively. To test the hypothesis that these hydrophobic residues were important in PGIS catalytic activity, the cDNA sequences at these six positions were altered individually to code for recombinant PGIS mutants: Ile67→ Lys (on β1-1), 2The designation for β strands of PGIS was according to that for P450BM-3 crystal structure (9Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) and is depicted in Fig. 1. Val76→ Asp (on β1-2), Thr206→ Val, Leu210→ Asp, Leu213→ Glu (on αF), and Phe476→ Val (between β4-1 and β4-2). Transient expression of each of these mutants in COS-1 cells generated a level of PGIS protein comparable with that of the wild-type (Fig. 3, A and B). 6-Keto-PGF1α levels produced by recombinant mutants Ile67→ Lys, Val76→ Asp, and Leu210→ Asp were markedly reduced to the level of the mock-transfected control as analyzed by TLC (Fig. 4). The TLC results were confirmed by radioimmunoassay of 6-keto-PGF1α fractions separated by reverse-phase HPLC (data not shown). The catalytic activities of PGIS mutants from multiple experiments expressed as percent of the wild-type PGIS activity are summarized in Table I. The activities of Ile67→ Lys, Val76→ Asp, and Leu210→ Asp were 5.1, 8.3, and 6.8% of the wild-type enzyme, respectively. By contrast, catalytic activity of mutants Thr206→ Val, Leu213→ Glu, or Phe476→ Val was not significantly different from that of the wild-type (100, 97, and 83%, respectively; Table I and Fig. 4). These results indicate that, as predicted by the three-dimensional model, Ile67, Val76, and Leu210 of PGIS are important in substrate access to the active site, while contrary to prediction from the model, Thr206, Leu213, and Phe476 are not critically involved in substrate access.Fig. 3Western blot analysis of PGIS expressed by wild-type and mutants in COS-1 cells. 15 μg of transfected COS-1 proteins separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel were transferred onto nitrocellulose and probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-human PGIS antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On both A and B, the position of PGIS is indicated on the right side, and the protein size in kilodaltons derived from molecular mass markers is indicated on the left side Vector denotes pSG5 without PGIS insert.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Autoradiogram of thin layer chromatography of mutants and wild-type PGIS.

Open table in a new tab Arg47, corresponding to Arg72 in PGIS model, is considered to be a “gate-keeper” for P450BM-3 enzyme. To determine whether this charged residue plays a similar role in PGIS, we altered it to Glu or Gln by site-directed mutagenesis. These two mutants expressed a similar quantity of proteins on Western blots as the wild-type (Fig. 3A) and had comparable catalytic activities as the wild-type enzyme (Table I and Fig. 4). Ravichandran et al. (9Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) predicted from the crystal structure of P450BM-3 that β1-4 strand was part of the substrate binding sites and residues Ala328, Ala330, and Met354 (on β1-3) were involved in the substrate binding. In this region, according to sequence alignment and PGIS modeling, three corresponding amino acid residues, Pro355, Glu360, and Leu384, respectively, were suggested to be involved in substrate binding (Fig. 2). A nearby residue in TXAS, Arg413 (on β1-4) corresponding to Asp364 in PGIS, was suggested to have interaction with substrate (11Wang L.-H. Matyevic-Aleksic N. Hsu P.-H. Ruan K.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19970-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Each of these four amino acid residues in the full-length PGIS cDNA was individually altered to Pro355→ Val, Glu360→ Gly, Asp364→ Val, and Leu384→ Asp. The level of each mutant protein expressed in transient transfected COS-1 cells was comparable with that of the wild-type (Fig. 3, A and B). PGIS activity was significantly diminished in Asp364→ Val and Leu384→ Asp mutants (6.8 and 6.9%, respectively; Table I and Fig. 4), whereas Pro355→ Val and Glu360→ Gly mutants retained a fraction of the wild-type enzymatic activity (34 and 44%, respectively). These results indicate that Pro355, Glu360, Leu384, and Asp364 are important in substrate binding as predicted by molecular modeling. A cysteine residue which serves as the proximal axial ligand for the heme iron through a thiolate bond is conserved among all P450s. There are only two Cys residues in PGIS, Cys231 (on αG) and Cys441, of which Cys441 corresponds to the consensus P450 cysteine (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Mutation of Cys441 to Ser by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a diminished enzyme activity (13%; Table I and Fig. 4), without alteration in the expressed protein level (Fig. 3B). Mutation of Cys231 to Ser did not alter the catalytic activity (98%) (Table I and Fig. 4). In the heme binding region of cytochrome P450, an Arg or a His residue is conserved which forms a hydrogen bond with the D-ring propionate group of the heme moiety. Alignment of amino acid sequence of the three-dimensional model of PGIS with that of P450BM-3 did not reveal a corresponding Arg or His. Instead, it suggested that Asn439 of PGIS was the corresponding residue (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). This raised the possibility that the heme binding environment of PGIS may differ from that of other P450s and Asn439 may be functionally important in heme binding. To test this hypothesis, Asn439 was altered to Ala. The protein level of mutant Asn439→ Ala in transient transfected COS-1 cells is similar to that of the wild-type. Contrary to the hypothesis, mutation of Asn439 to Ala resulted in a slight increase in the PGIS activity. Crystallographic structure of P450BM-3 suggests that Phe87 of P450BM-3 is involved in heme interaction (9Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). However, neither sequence alignment nor molecular modeling disclosed a corresponding Phe residue around this region in PGIS. The corresponding residue derived from molecular modeling was Leu112 (Fig. 2). To test if this Leu residue can provide hydrophobic interactions with heme and substrate as the Phe residue in other P450s does, Leu112 was mutated to Asp, Phe, or Gly by site-directed mutagenesis. The catalytic activity of mutant Leu112→ Phe was only slightly lower (89%) than that of the wild-type, while the activity of mutants Leu112→ Asp and Leu112→ Gly was reduced to 11 and 15% of the wild-type enzyme, respectively (Table I). Pro113 was mutated as a control. Although situated next to Leu112, this residue was not located at the vicinity of heme or substrate pocket on the PGIS model. Pro113→ Ala mutant as predicted from the model retained most of the catalytic activity (Table I). Molecular modeling coupled with site-directed mutagenesis is a powerful tool in studying the structure-activity relationship of cytochrome P450 enzymes. PGIS is a new family of P450 which shares several enzymatic and spectral characteristics with TXAS. Based on our previous observations that the crystallographic structure of P450BM-3 serves as a suitable template for constructing the three-dimensional model of TXAS (10Ruan K.-H. Milfeld K. Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we have taken a similar approach in constructing the three-dimensional model of PGIS, and the results indicate that the generated model is valuable for identifying the amino acid residues involved in substrate binding and heme environment. The PGIS model suggests that the substrate access channel of PGIS is similar to that of P450BM-3 in that it is very long and lined with hydrophobic residues. This result is not surprising since the substrate (PGH2) for PGIS is a 20-carbon metabolite of arachidonate, a substrate for P450BM-3. Our site-directed mutagenesis results indicate that Ile67, Val76, and Leu384, which are situated along the lower portion of the channel according to the PGIS model (Fig. 2), are critically important in PGIS catalytic activity. Mutations of these hydrophobic residues to charged residues reduced the catalytic activity to the background value. Hence, this portion of the binding pocket in PGIS is comparable with that of P450BM-3. Two residues (Pro355 and Glu360) are located inside the lower portion of the binding pocket adjacent to heme (Fig. 2). Mutations of these two residues, Glu360→ Gly and Pro355→ Val retained 44 and 34% activity, respectively, suggesting that these two charged residues are involved in catalytic activity. We have shown previously that TXAS Arg413, which is not predicted to be located at the binding pocket based on P450BM-3 structure, is important in TXAS catalytic activity (11Wang L.-H. Matyevic-Aleksic N. Hsu P.-H. Ruan K.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19970-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This residue corresponds to PGIS Asp364. Mutation of Asp364 to Val reduced the catalytic activity to the background value, indicating that these two corresponding residues are similarly important in PGIS and TXAS activities. According to the PGIS model, this charged residue was located near the lining of the substrate binding pocket but not in the vicinity of PGH2 or heme (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results indicate that, with minor exceptions, the lower part of the substrate binding pocket containing β1-1, β1-2, β1-3, and β1-4 strands in PGIS model (Fig. 2) is comparable with that of P450BM-3. By contrast, the upper portion of the substrate binding pocket of PGIS was not as well predicted from the P450BM-3 structure. Only one of the four predicted residues is important in substrate binding and catalytic activity: Leu210→ Asp lost the activity, whereas Thr206→ Val, Leu213→ Glu, and Phe476→ Val retained the activity completely. It has been indicated that Met185 and Leu437 in P450BM-3 form strong van der Waals interactions (9Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). These two residues correspond to Leu210 and Phe476 in PGIS by modeling. As mentioned above, the mutant Leu210→ Asp completely lost the catalytic activity as predicted from the P450BM-3 structure, whereas mutation of Phe476 to Val surprisingly had no effect on the activity. The discrepancy between the predicted and experimental data by site-directed mutagenesis indicates that the molecular model around the upper portion of the channel of PGIS (Fig. 2) containing most of αF helix (Thr206, Leu210, and Leu213) is different from that of P450BM-3. Since the polarity and size of AA are different form PGH2, it is expected to find disagreement between the structure of P450BM-3 (using AA as substrate) and PGIS (using PGH2 as substrate) around the substrate access channel. Arg72 in PGIS model is corresponding to Arg47 in P450BM-3 structure. This P450BM-3 Arg residue is located at the mouth of its access channel in strand β1-2 close to the molecular surface and is not well defined in the crystal structure (9Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Mutation of Arg to Glu in P450BM-3 blocks the enzymatic reaction, and this residue was suggested to be important in substrate recognition and binding (9Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 24Graham-Lorence S. Peterson J.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mutation of the conserved Arg in PGIS to charged residue, Glu or Gln, of comparable size did not significantly change the catalytic activity (101 and 80%, respectively). These results imply that the charge group of this Arg is not important in substrate access and binding in PGIS. Unlike the P450BM-3, which is a soluble enzyme, the PGIS has a trans-membrane domain at its N-terminal, which is close to the entrance of the substrate binding pocket. We speculated that the entrance of substrate channel of PGIS differs from that of P450BM-3 because of the influence of membrane topology of PGIS on substrate channel orientation. The three-dimensional model of PGIS predicts Cys441 to be the proximal axial ligand for heme iron. This prediction was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Hatae et al. (25Hatae T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Yabuki T. Inoue H. Ullich V. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have recently obtained a similar result. This cysteine provides the thiol moiety to coordinate the heme. It has been shown that P450s exhibit a conserved sequence motif (F-G/S-X-G-X-R/H-X-C-hy-G, where hy denotes any hydrophobic residue) at the cysteine region near the C terminus of P450 proteins (26Haermann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Baddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 2: 41-62Google Scholar). This motif in PGIS, WGAGHNHCLG, differs from the conserved motif by two residues: substitutions of Trp (W) for Phe (F) and Asn (N) for Arg/His (R/H). Since Phe to Trp substitution also occurs in nitric oxide synthase, we altered the second substitution from Asn439 to Ala. This mutant surprisingly exhibited a slight increase in the catalytic activity. Asn439 is unlikely to be the corresponding conserved Arg or His. This result implies that structure around the heme environment of PGIS is different from that of other P450s. The crystal structure of P450BM-3 predicted that Phe87 forms close van der Waals interactions with the heme on the distal side and the corresponding residue in P450cam provides hydrophobic interactions with the substrate camphor (27Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). The corresponding residue in PGIS is Leu112. It is interesting to note that alteration of Leu112 to Phe retained the catalytic activity whereas change of it to a charged residue (Asp) or a smaller residue (Gly) reduced the activity markedly. This result indicates that Leu can substitute Phe in this region to provide hydrophobic interaction with heme and probably also with PGH2. Despite a marked loss of catalytic activity, mutants, Cys441→ Ser and Leu112→ Asp or Leu112→ Gly, in which the heme environment is severely perturbed still expressed intact proteins as detected by Western blots. By contrast, TXAS in which the heme ligation or environment is perturbed by site-directed mutation expresses a very low level of proteins in cells (11Wang L.-H. Matyevic-Aleksic N. Hsu P.-H. Ruan K.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19970-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The stability of TXAS protein expression requires heme in a correct orientation. On the other hand, stability of PGIS protein appears to be less dependent on heme. These results epitomize major structural differences between PGIS and TXAS despite a similar substrate binding pocket. Guided by the three-dimensional model, we have identified nine amino acid residues which are near or line the substrate binding pocket and are important in catalytic activity, especially the residues in β1-1, β1-2, β1-3, and β1-4 strands region. We have also confirmed Cys441 as the proximal axial ligand of heme iron. However, the model is imperfect and fails to predict amino acid residues in other regions of the active site pocket especially in the αF helix region, heme environment and the substrate entrance gate-keeper. These inconsistencies between the model and the experimental data offer an interesting opportunity for further experiments to elucidate the different and potential new structural characteristics of PGIS. One approach is to refine the model based on the site-directed mutagenesis data from which additional functionally important residues can be identified. It is hoped that, through these experiments, the PGIS active site pocket and heme site can be more precisely mapped. Eventually, these structures will have to be confirmed by three-dimensional structure derived from x-ray crystallography and/or NMR spectroscopy."

Guarente L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 283-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). XP is characterized by sensitivity to UV irradiation and by an increased frequency of skin cancers, whereas Cockayne's syndrome is characterized by neurological disorders and retarded growth. Recently, it has also been demonstrated that mutations in the human gene product homologous to the E. coli ReqQ helicases are responsible for Bloom's syndrome, an inheritable human genetic disease characterized by small physical size, photosensitivity, and immunodeficiency (10Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.-Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in another putative DNA helicase have been shown recently to be responsible for Werner's syndrome in humans, an inherited disease characterized by premature aging (11Yu C.-E. Oshima J. Fu Y.-H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D.

Helicase proteins are defined by several conserved protein motifs, all of which appear to be necessary for their function (12Pause A. Methot N. Sonenburg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6789-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 13Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 14Zhu L. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 469-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide triphosphate binding domains, encoded by the A and B boxes, are present in every helicase (15Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gray N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). The B box has been used to define subfamilies of helicases, such as the DEAD and DEAH families of helicases. Of the known helicases, the canonical RNA helicase eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-4A has been studied most extensively by mutational analysis (12Pause A. Methot N. Sonenburg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6789-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 13Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). These molecular studies have allowed functions, such as ATP hydrolysis, RNA unwinding, and RNA binding, to be assigned to specific conserved domains. Even so, there are motifs for which function(s) remain unknown. At least three members of the helicase family may take part in the process of chromosome segregation and transmission. The Drosophila melanogaster gene lodestar has been shown to be involved in the early divisions of the blastocyst (16Girdham C.H. Glover D.M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1786-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Deletion of this gene leads to the death of the D. melanogaster embryo by the 13th division and the presence of tangled and broken chromosomes. Several yeast genes involved in chromosome transmission, with strong similarities to helicases, have also been isolated. The yeast gene SGS1 was isolated as a suppressor of a type I topoisomerase mutant, top3 (17Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). SGS1 has since been shown to be necessary for maintaining the fidelity of chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis (18Watt P.M. Louis E.J. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Deletion of this gene results in altered chromosome segregation, presumably due to nondysjunction of sister chromatids. The yeast CHL1 gene product is structurally related to DNA helicases as well (19Gerring S.L. Spencer F. Hieter P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4347-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It was cloned by complementation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant, chl1, which is also defective in the fidelity of chromosome transmission. Yeast chl1 null mutants remain viable, but there is a substantial increase in the rate of missegregation (>200-fold) of specific chromosomes, with chromosome loss and nondysjunction contributing equally to this phenotype (19Gerring S.L. Spencer F. Hieter P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4347-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The frequency of mitotic recombination in chl1 null mutants is near that of the wild-type, suggesting that it is not involved in replication or recombination. Furthermore, genetic studies in yeast indicate that the CHL1 protein does not function in the RAD9-dependent DNA repair pathway. The chl1 mutation also appears to activate a cell cycle checkpoint leading to a G2-M phase delay, suggesting that this protein acts prior to the completion of mitosis. Here we report the cloning of two human cDNAs with high homology to the product of the S. cerevisiae gene CHL1 Characterization of the corresponding cDNA clones revealed that they are encoded by a gene highly related to CHL1 Translation of the corresponding open reading frame (ORF) of this gene predicts a 102-kDa protein (actual mobility of the IVTT protein by SDS-PAGE is ∼112 kDa) containing all of the conserved motifs of a helicase. Based on genomic studies, two distinct human CHL1-related cDNAs (hCHLR1 and hCHLR2) are generated by unique, but highly homologous (>98%), genes (20Amann J. Valentine M. Kidd V.J. Lahti J.M. Genomics. 1996; 32: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 2While under review, a separate study was published by Frank and Werner (S. Frank and S. Werner, J. Biol. Chem. 271, 24337-24340, 1996) reporting the hCHLR1 sequence as the human homologue of the yeast CHL1 gene. These authors report that this gene product is responsive to keratinocyte growth factor, consistent with our growth studies of the same gene. We also demonstrate that hCHLR1 mRNA and protein are expressed in dividing cells but not in cells signaled to terminally differentiate or cease their growth due to serum withdrawal. The timing of hCHLR protein expression indicates that these proteins are not required during G1, but that they could function during S, G2, or M phase. An IVTT hCHLR1 protein binds to single- and double-stranded DNA under salt conditions that are similar to other DNA-binding proteins, suggesting that this protein is also a DNA-binding protein. Finally, cellular fractionation studies and indirect immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of HeLa cells with an affinity-purified hCHLR antisera demonstrates that the protein(s) are present in the nucleolus. In a screen of human genomic DNA for cell cycle-related protein kinase genes, we fortuitously isolated a human cosmid containing a gene with motifs characteristic of a helicase. Single-copy DNA sequence from this cosmid clone, CDC2R-10, isolated by hybridization with a full-length human p34cdc2 cDNA, was used to screen a lambda cDNA library corresponding to human K562 cells (Stratagene). It is presumed that the genomic cosmid clone containing the human CHL1-related gene was isolated by cross-hybridization with a low-copy repeat element contained within the 3′ untranslated region of the human p34cdc2 cDNA, because this region of the p34cdc2 cDNA, but not the region containing the ORF, strongly hybridized with the CDC2R-10 cosmid. It may also be possible that a CDC2-like family member could be closely linked to the human CHL1-related gene. Five of the hCHLR-positive clones identified from the K562 cDNA library were fully or partially sequenced as described previously (21Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for DNA sequencing were produced on an Applied Biosystems 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer by the Molecular Resources Facility of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. It was determined that a full-length hCHLR cDNA clone had not been obtained, and subsequent screens were performed using both HeLa and human fetal liver lambda cDNA libraries. Sequence analysis also revealed that a majority of the cDNA clones were derived from heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) and contained intronic sequences. For this reason, HeLa cytoplasmic RNA was isolated (22Ball L.A. Amann J.M. Garrett B.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2326-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used for both RACE and PCR cloning of the full-length cDNA. The RACE protocol was used to isolate the 5′ end of the cDNA as determined by the presence of motif I and upstream stop codons in all three possible ORFs. Although overlapping cDNA clones and 5′ RACE products did allow us to determine the sequence of the entire coding region and regions of the 5′ and 3′ UTR, the full-length clone was assembled as described below from cDNA clones and reverse transcription-PCR fragments (which were generated by using hCHLR1-specific primers). One hCHLR1 cDNA clone isolated from the K562 library, clone 19a, which contained the C-terminal third of the predicted hChlR1 peptide sequence, and a portion of the 3′ UTR was subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene). Restriction analysis of the full-length sequence revealed a StuI site in clone 19a and a unique SacII site at nucleotide 1321 of the full-length cDNA. Primers were designed on either side of these two restriction sites, and reverse transcription-PCR, using HeLa cytoplasmic RNA, was used to generate a fragment corresponding to this region. The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned and sequenced to insure that there were no PCR artifacts. The fragment from this reverse transcription-PCR product was cut with SacII and StuI and subcloned into the SacII and StuI sites of pKS and clone 19a, respectively, creating pCHL. A second PCR fragment was generated spanning a unique SacI site in the 5′ UTR 96 base pairs upstream of the translational start site and the unique SacII site. This PCR product was subcloned and sequenced, and a SacI and SacII fragment from this PCR reaction was subcloned into the corresponding sites of pCHL, creating pFLCHL, a full-length hCHLR1 cDNA. Total RNA was isolated from cells according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi and run on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63019) Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred to a Duralose (Stratagene) membrane and hybridized as described previously (21Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double- and single-stranded DNA binding assays were performed as described by others (24Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 25Delmas V. Stokes D.G. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2414-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The human E2A-HLF and CBFβ cDNA clones for IVTT, used as controls for these experiments, were kindly provided by Drs. A. T. Look and S. Hiebert, respectively (26Inaba T. Shapiro L.H. Funabiki T. Sinclair A.E. Jones B.G. Ashmun R.A. Look A.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3403-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the hChlR1 protein were made to amino acids 2-130 (Hel1) and 427-542 (Hel3) of the predicted ORF of pFLCHL. PCR products, generated using primers containing BamHI and HindIII sites, were subcloned into KS-PCR for sequencing. Clones for each region, having the correct sequence, were subcloned into the pQE9 expression vector (Qiagen), which places a six-histidine tag at the 5′ end of the sequence. Protein was induced by the addition of 2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thio-galactopyranoside, followed by growth at 37°C for 3-4 h. Bacterial lysates for Hel1 were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocols, and the Hel1 fusion protein was purified by nickel-agarose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography. The Hel3 fusion protein was completely insoluble. Therefore, bacterial lysates containing the Hel3 protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, followed by excision of the gel slice containing the antigen which was then used, with Freund's adjuvant, as described previously (21Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)(Rockland, Inc.). The purified, and soluble, Hel1 protein was used to generate antibodies in an identical manner. The soluble, affinity-purified Hel1 fusion protein was linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Sigma), which was then used to affinity-purify the Hel1 antibody. The affinity-purified Hel1 antiserum was eluted from the matrix by using Actisep elution medium (Sterogen) and passed over a PD-10 desalting column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to remove the Actisep medium. It was not possible to affinity-purify the Hel3 antibody because of its insoluble nature. However, we were able to use this antibody to effectively immunoprecipitate the IVTT hCHLR1 protein. Immunoprecipitations and Western blots were used to determine the specificity of the Hel1 and Hel3 antisera as described previously (21Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitations, the pFLCHL cDNA was in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine, and a portion of the reaction was incubated at 4°C with each purified antibody in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5) for 2-4 h. Immunoprecipitation and competition experiments utilizing the 6-His-Hel1 antigen were performed as described previously (21Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gels. Western blots of the purified Hel1 protein, as well as in vitro transcribed and translated protein and tissue culture cell lysates (prepared as described previously)(21), were used to determine the effectiveness of the antisera in detection of the protein on membranes using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.) to visualize the protein. Western blot analysis was also performed using the purified human RNA polymerase II protein complex corresponding to a MonoS column purified fraction from HeLa cells containing a subset of the basal transcription factors and human homologues of yeast proteins that are suppressors of RNA polymerase B (SRB), transcriptional coactivators which increase the activation of transcription, as well as essential components that complement XPF-, XPG-, and XPC-DNA repair-deficient extracts (28Maldonado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P. Lees E. Anderson C.W. Linn S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This complex was kindly provided by Drs. Danny Reinberg and Helen Cho. K562 cells, a human myeloid cell line, were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine. HeLa cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. WI-38 cells, normal human lung fibroblasts, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in basal medium (Eagle) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For the differentiation experiment, K562 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml. Twenty-four h after seeding, the cells were induced to differentiate using 40 μM hemin or 60 nM 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-Acetate (TPA)(29Rutherford T.R. Weatherall D.J. Cell. 1979; 16: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A Me2SO control was also included. Three days after addition of the hemin and TPA, cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated. For the growth cessation experiments, WI-38 cells (normal human diploid fibroblasts, passage 8) were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/ml. Twenty-four h after seeding, a portion of the cells were harvested for RNA or protein analysis, and the medium on the remaining dishes was replaced with medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. After 3 days in the low-serum medium, another sample was taken, and the medium was replaced with medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. At staged-intervals following the addition of serum, cells were collected for isolation of protein and/or RNA as well as FACS analysis of their cell cycle. CEM-C7 cells were fractionated as described by Dickinson and Kohwi-Shigematsu (30Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and concentrated using Centriprep-3 and Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon). Each was made in 1 × RIPA prior to Western blot analysis. As localization controls, monoclonal antibodies to PCNA (Pharmingen) and/or NuMA (CalBiochem)(31) were used on these same Western blots. The DNA sequences of the two largest cDNA clones that hybridized to the single-copy DNA sequences from cosmid CDCR-10, 3a (2.2 kb) and 19a (1.0 kb), were determined. Analysis of the predicted ORFs of these cDNA clones using the SWISS-PROT and PIR protein data banks indicated that they encoded nonoverlapping sequences of a human protein most closely related to the CHL1 gene product of S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1, Fig. 2A). This analysis also revealed that clone 3a was an in-frame fusion of two unrelated cDNAs. The region corresponding to the yeast CHL1 comprised the last 1 kb of this cDNA. CHL1 is a 99-kDa protein with the conserved domains of a DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase that is involved in the maintenance of high fidelity chromosome segregation (19Gerring S.L. Spencer F. Hieter P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4347-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Translation of the CHL1-related region of clone 3a revealed an ORF with 22% identity to the N-terminal portion of CHL1, most notably in the two conserved helicase motifs, domains Ia and II (Fig. 2). This clone lacked conserved domain I (32Hodgman T.C. Nature. 1988; 333: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 33Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 34Sher A. Pearce E.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 478Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition of domain II places this protein in the DEAD/DEAH subfamily of RNA and DNA helicases (33Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Clone 19a contains an ORF that is 40% identical to the C-terminal portion of the CHL1 protein. This ORF contains conserved helicase domains IV, V (a helix-turn-helix domain), and VI, where the sequence identity is greatest.Fig. 2Protein sequence comparison of Human CHLR1 and S. cerevisiae CHL1. A, comparison of hCHLR and yeast CHL1 proteins yields a sequence identity of 33% and a homology of 50%.

B, schematic comparing the location of the conserved domains in hCHLR1, S. cerevisiae CHL1, and S. cerevisiae Rad3. Rad3 is included because this protein had the highest homology to CHL1 prior to the cloning of the hCHLR1 cDNA, and it is indicative of how the location of the conserved motifs varies between these proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The lack of several conserved helicase domains and upstream stop codons indicated that we had not isolated a full-length clone. In addition, Northern blot analysis with the hCHLR1 cDNAs demonstrated a 4.7-kb mRNA species in proliferating cell lines (data not shown) and in human tissues that contained dividing cells (Fig. 3). Therefore, we decided to screen additional cDNA libraries in an attempt to isolate full-length clones. Two additional cDNA libraries were screened in an attempt to isolate overlapping cDNAs. Analysis of the two largest clones from this group of overlapping clones revealed homologous sequences encoding an ORF containing conserved helicase domain III, as well as additional 5′ sequences. However, domain I was not contained in any of these clones. One of the cDNA isolates also contained a conserved proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine sequence located downstream of helicase domain I, identical to the location of a similar proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine sequence in the yeast Chl1 protein (19Gerring S.L. Spencer F. Hieter P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4347-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of additional cDNAs revealed that these clones could be divided into two distinct groups based on 31 nucleotide differences dispersed throughout the coding sequences. Seventeen of these nucleotide differences resulted in amino acid changes (Fig. 1). The significance of these amino acid differences is unknown at this time; however, four of these changes are conservative substitutions, and none of the altered amino acids are located in the conserved helicase domains or putative nuclear localization signal sequences. These two related cDNA clones are most likely encoded by distinct, but homologous, genes located on human chromosome 12p11 and 12p13 (20Amann J. Valentine M. Kidd V.J. Lahti J.M. Genomics. 1996; 32: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Using a PCR-based strategy, RACE, we isolated sequences encoding the N-terminal region of one of the two human CHL1-related proteins (35Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4323) Google Scholar). The major 1200-base pair product produced by this method was subcloned, sequenced, and found to contain helicase conserved motif I, as well as additional 5′ sequences (Fig. 1). In-frame termination codons were located near the 5′ end of the PCR product, suggesting that this fragment encoded the entire 5′ portion of the hCHLR1 mRNA, including the 5′ UTR. Several other RACE products were also isolated as well as DNA sequence from this reaction and a second independent reaction using oligonucleotide primers located 3′ of motif I. A number of these RACE products appear to result from alternative splicing in the 5′ UTR and coding region, whereas others may represent cDNA products from the other locus. These points are still under investigation. The two distinct cDNA classes isolated in these studies have been named hCHLR1 and hCHLR2, respectively, for uman-1 elated (Fig. 1, Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2132954462,"Cancer predisposition in approximately 60% of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) families is associated with germline mutation of the TP53 gene. The p53 protein has been shown to mediate G1 arrest following DNA damage. We have investigated gamma-irradiation-induced transient and permanent G1 arrest in normal and LFS fibroblasts. The duration of transient G1 arrest varied between strains, but there was no difference in the range between normal (2-12 h) and LFS (1-13 h) cells. However, the extent of permanent G1 arrest was greatly reduced in LFS fibroblasts (mean 33+/-8% of the cell population) compared with normals (mean 67+/-9%) and correlated with their increased radiation survival (r=0.97, P<0.001). This phenotype was observed in LFS fibroblasts both with (seven cases) and without (two cases) TP53 mutation. Parallel studies with fibroblasts derived from cancer-prone, p53-deficient mice revealed no radiation-induced G1 cell cycle arrest in p53 null (-/-) cells. The p53 +/- cells were comparable to the wt p53 cells in transient G1 arrest capacity, but showed a diminished permanent G1 arrest. These data clearly implicate p53 function in permanent G1 arrest. The reduced capacity for DNA damage-induced, permanent G1 arrest in LFS may contribute significantly to cancer predisposition in this familial syndrome."

Substitution of alanine 714 with cysteine did not alter glycine sensitivity, although this mutant was rapidly inhibited by dithionitrobenzoate. Glycine protected the A714C mutant from modification by dithionitrobenzoate, whereas the co-agonist L-glutamate was ineffective.

The receptor possesses a unique Ca2+ permeability and a voltage-dependent Mg2+ block (1Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 394: 501-527Crossref Scopus (726) Google Scholar). These two features define the NMDA receptor's role in several important physiologic phenomena, including long term potentiation, neuronal development, and excitotoxicity (2Nakanishi S. Masayuki Y. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 319-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). However, the functional characteristic that may most differentiate the NMDA receptor from other glutamate receptors is a requirement for the co-agonist glycine (3Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar, 4Kleckner N. Dingledine R. Science. 1988; 241: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Occupancy of both glutamate and glycine binding sites is necessary for receptor activation, and the two sites are allosterically coupled (5Lester R.A.J. Tong G. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Priestly T. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1191-1196PubMed Google Scholar). The distinct glycine binding site has been suggested to play a role in regulation of NMDA receptor desensitization (7Mayer M.L. Vyklicky Jr., L. Clements J. Nature. 1989; 338: 425-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). While several residues in the amino terminus of NR1 have been demonstrated to greatly influence glycine affinity, binding is also modulated by the contributing NR2 subunits (8Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Indeed, the glycine binding site is a current experimental target for therapeutic intervention in the hours immediately following ischemic stroke (9Koroshetz W.J. Moskowitz M.A. Trends Pharmacol.

Despite functional differences among the glutamate receptors, several recent studies have converged upon a single topology model for the ionotropic glutamate receptor family (10Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E.

Several subsequent systematic studies concluded that non-NMDA glutamate receptor subunits possessed a three-transmembrane domain architecture (11Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 12Bennett J.A. Dingledine R.

By generating functional N-linked glycosylation mutants of the NMDA NR1 subunit, we tested the hypothesized existence of a conserved hairpin pore structure similar to that found in voltage-gated K+ channels (13Wood M.W.

An important consequence of the new three-transmembrane domain configuration is an extracellular location of the M3-M4 linker. Inconsistent with the conclusion from these topology studies, however, were findings from several groups that residues in the M3-M4 linker of non-NMDA glutamate receptors could be phosphorylated (21Raymond L.A.

Most notably, two separate laboratories had determined that a serine residue (Ser-684) in the M3-M4 linker of GluR6 acted as a substrate for protein kinase A (PKA) (21Raymond L.A. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Wang L.-Y. Taverna F.A. Huang X.-P. MacDonald J.F. Hampson D.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1173-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The topology studies and the GluR6 phosphorylation data may be reconciled if two short transmembrane regions flanking the phosphorylation site are invoked (Fig. 1; see also Ref. 13Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We have investigated this possibility utilizing the NR1 subunit through the introduction of both a novel PKA site and an N-linked glycosylation site in a region analogous to Ser-684 of GluR6. Subsequently, we have identified an alanine residue present in the glycine binding pocket of the NMDA receptor. Mutagenesis was performed using the mega-primer method as described previously (13Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mutations were subcloned into the pCR vector (Invitrogen) prior to insertion into a modified pN60 NR1 clone (26Moriyoshi K. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 354: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar) containing an altered 5′-untranslated region (27Wood M.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8115-8120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) using the restriction enzymes SacI (nucleotide 2058) and SphI (nucleotide 2237) (New England Biolabs). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Quantitative cRNA injections were performed as described (27Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8115-8120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The construct ∊-68 (mouse NR2A with the 5′-untranslated region truncated at nucleotide −68) was used with the coinjection experiments (28Meguro H. Mori H. Araki K. Kushiya E. Kutsuwada T. Yamazaki M. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Sakimura K. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 357: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Two separate transcription reactions of each cRNA were performed, and four batches of oocytes were injected (two of each transcription). In each case, five oocytes of each combination were tested 3 days after injection. Otherwise, cRNA was in vitro synthesized as described previously (13Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). All measurements were made from oocytes coinjected with robustly expressing ∊ constructs 2-5 days after injection (27Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8115-8120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Whole cell responses to agonist applications were obtained as described previously (13Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Oocytes were held at −50 mV and perfused continuously with a Mg2+- and Ca2+-free solution containing (in mM) 100 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.5 BaCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, 24°C. Responses to submaximal agonist concentrations were preceded and followed by measurements at maximal concentrations to correct for any drift caused by gradual run-up of oocyte responses. Peak current responses to agonist application and accompanying voltage measurements were determined using PCLAMP hardware and software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Dose-response curves for L-glutamate and glycine were fitted with the Hill equation with the Hill coefficient fixed at unity. Half-maximal concentrations (EC50) were calculated by minimizing the sum of squared residuals calculated from the averaged responses at each concentration. Glycine-apparent affinities were measured in the presence of 100 μML-glutamate and L-glutamate affinities in the presence of 100 μM glycine. Membranes from 30 Xenopus oocytes were prepared as described previously (13Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Western analysis was also performed as described previously (13Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), except that a polyclonal antibody generated against the carboxyl terminus of NR1a (Chemicon) was employed as primary antibody because the signal produced using the monoclonal antibody generated against the M3-M4 linker of NR1 (monoclonal antibody 54.1, Pharmingen) produced a weaker signal of the G3 mutation. This may be due to disruption of the antigenic epitope by the artificial N-glycosylation site. A canonical PKA consensus sequence was designed around an existing serine in the M3-M4 linker of the NR1 subunit at a position analogous to Ser-684 of GluR6 (Fig. 1). When this mutation (NR1-PKA = 710:S) was expressed in Xenopus oocytes in combination with the NR2A subunit, it was discovered that application of high concentrations of the co-agonist glycine were necessary to activate the receptor (Fig. 2). The apparent affinity for glycine was shifted over two orders of magnitude from that of the wild-type combination (0.5 mM versus 1.5 μM). The shift in apparent affinity could have arisen from phosphorylation of the novel PKA site via basal kinase activity. To test this possibility, we reconstructed the canonical PKA sequence additionally mutating the targeted serine to alanine (Fig. 3). The mutation (NR1 710:) did not restore the apparent affinity for the co-agonist glycine, and, in fact, produced a further rightward shift (EC50 = 990 μM). This finding excluded the possibility that the phenotype arose from phosphorylation of the artificial site, thereby suggesting that the mutated residues were interfering with glycine binding. To identify which of the four mutated residues comprising the artificial PKA site were responsible for the shift in affinity, we generated the individual point mutants of each residue. Fig. 4A demonstrates that mutation of the alanine at position 714 to leucine (A714L) produced the dominant shift in glycine affinity. Furthermore, another reconstructed PKA mutation including an alanine reversion at position 714 (NR1 710:SA) restored most of the glycine sensitivity (EC50 = 17 μM, see Fig. 4B). Therefore, position 714 is the most influential residue within the artificial PKA site affecting apparent glycine affinity. This effect may be interpreted to indicate that the presence of a leucine at position 714 interferes with ligand binding and that Ala-714 therefore is part of the glycine binding site. However, there are two problems that complicate the localization of a mutated residue to an agonist binding site: transduction and propagation. A mutation that affects the apparent affinity of a receptor can do so by either altering ligand binding or by interfering with transduction. The transduction process encompasses all the conformational changes that follow ligand binding and that result in an increased probability for the ion channel to be open. Examples of transduction mutants are pore mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that affected the apparent affinities for acetylcholine by (de)stabilizing the open state of the channel (29Akabas M.H. Staufer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). A shift in apparent affinity alone can therefore not be used to infer localization of the mutated residue to a binding site (30Colquhoun D. Farrant M. Nature. 1993; 366: 510-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The prospect that A714L is a transduction mutant seems less likely given the fact that the apparent affinity for the co-agonist, L-glutamate, was not concomitantly decreased in this mutant (Table I). In contrast, the mild apparent glycine and L-glutamate affinity shifts of the other three point mutants of the residues comprising the PKA consensus sequence are roughly equivalent (Table I). These mutants may disturb transduction or the allosteric coupling of the two co-agonists (5Lester R.A.J. Tong G. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Priestly T.

VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8115-8120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A transduction mutant that causes a rightward shift in the apparent agonist affinity would spend less time in the open state, even at maximal agonist concentrations. Such a mutant would be expected to exhibit a lower whole cell response given an equivalent receptor density. Therefore, expression levels of both heteromeric and homomeric channels measured at maximal agonist concentrations were compared (mean ± S.E., n = 20): NR1+NR2A 20 ± 2 μA; NR1-A714L+NR2A 26 ± 2 μA; NR1 homomer 21 ± 3 nA; NR1-A714L homomer 42 ± 8 nA. Two-tailed Student's t tests could not detect a significance difference (p > 0.2 for both heteromeric and homomeric comparisons). A second long-standing challenge to interpreting mutagenesis data has been to exclude the possibility that a mutation exerts its effect by introducing a structural defect which propagates to induce a conformational change in a remote part of the protein structure. It is possible that the change in apparent affinity ensuing from mutation of Ala-714 was the result of altered protein structure. In this case, modification of a distant residue could have induced a change in binding site affinity. The remaining experiments were designed to address this question. We generated a mutation complementary to NR1-PKA, in which the targeted serine residue was incorporated into an N-linked glycosylation consensus site (13Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Western analysis indicated that this mutant, NR1-G3, produced an increase in apparent molecular weight consistent with extracellular localization (Fig. 5). Its disruption of glycine affinity is approximately equal to a combination of point mutations at the individual residues that comprise it (Y711N,E712A versus Y711R and E712A, respectively, Table I). It is surprising that the attachment of a large carbohydrate moiety three amino acids upstream from position 714 does not impart a greater disturbance. This outcome suggests that position 711 already exists at the surface of the protein and that the attachment of a carbohydrate does not greatly distort the local protein structure. Given that an alanine side chain is an unlikely candidate for direct participation in binding glycine, we generated another series of mutations at position 714. Ten additional mutations were examined for correlation between the resulting affinities and the properties of the substituted amino acids. Of the parameters investigated (including alpha-helix and beta-strand propensity, hydrophobicity, and frequency of occurrence in defined protein structures), the only positive correlate to glycine affinity identified was side chain volume. A linear regression was performed, and the final regression model is shown in Fig. 6. The correlation between side chain volume and affinity implies that the natural alanine residue at this position plays the architectural role of generating space for the ligand glycine. It furthermore infers that voluminous substitutions at this position create a steric hindrance that inhibits binding. Amino acids not well fit by the volume regression model may offer additional clues. Notably, the threonine mutation is the least well fit by this model. The increase in glycine affinity of the A714T mutation could be explained if the hydroxyl group of the threonine was capable of substituting for a water molecule otherwise neighboring the glycine molecule. Along these lines, it is interesting to note that the volume correlation neatly divides the hydrophilic amino acids from the more hydrophobic. The two aromatic residues also impart less disturbance than their volumes would predict. This may be a product of their unique geometry or the particular affinity that glycine possesses for aromatics (8Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). An alternate explanation of volume correlation would propose that larger amino acids exhibit greater disruption of proper protein folding and that the consequence of this disruption is decreased glycine affinity. The A714C mutation presented an opportunity to test this alternate interpretation. Cysteine is similar in size to alanine, and the A714C mutation exhibits a glycine affinity similar to that of the wild type receptor (Table I). Therefore, it can be assumed that little disruption of protein folding is generated by the A714C mutation. We utilized the unique reactivity of the cysteine residue to demonstrate the importance of position 714 in NMDA receptor function (Fig. 7). Application of the thiol selective reagent dithionitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) to the A714C mutation greatly inhibited the function of the receptor (95% inhibition in 1 min). This oxidizing agent forms a mixed disulfide with free thiols. The mixed disulfide may remain or proceed to formation of a cysteine-cysteine bond in some instances (31Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 32Faulstich H. Heintz D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because of a slow reversibility of the inhibition incurred by A714C upon DTNB exposure, we were not able to accurately assess the glycine affinity of the DTNB-labeled mutant. The reversibility may be a result of thiol-disulfide interchange (33Kanarek L. Bradshaw R.A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2755-2757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Webster A. Hay R. Kemp G. Cell. 1993; 72: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). DTNB was therefore applied in the presence of either L-glutamate or glycine. Protection from DTNB inhibition was afforded by glycine in a time-dependent manner. Co-application of L-glutamate, however, did not protect from DTNB inhibition. Selective protection by glycine but not L-glutamate argues against the possibility that the changes in glycine affinity arise from global changes in protein folding. Rather, it suggests that the presence of glycine protects A714C from reaction with DTNB by limiting the access of DTNB to the glycine binding pocket of the NMDA receptor. Probing of a ligand binding site with cysteine substitutions has been performed previously (35Javitch J. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 36McLaughlin J.T. Hawrot E. Yellen G. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Limited protection from a cysteine labeling reaction has also been demonstrated (35Javitch J. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, this experiment offers a unique view of the time course of protection by the endogenous agonist from the reaction of a residue in a ligand binding site. Our previous results indicated that both extremes of the M3-M4 linker of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit exist in the extracellular space. This supported the hypothesized existence of a conserved hairpin pore structure similar to that found in voltage-gated K+ channels (13Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 37Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Subsequent evidence suggests that four other sites of the M3-M4 linker of NR1 are extracellular (14Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In our current study, three separate measures provide further support to the three-transmembrane domain model. The shifts in glycine affinity, the increase in apparent molecular weight of an N-linked glycosylation site, and the unique susceptibility of a cysteine residue, each arising from mutations in the central portion of the M3-M4 linker, are all consistent with extracellular localization. The significance of the M3-M4 linker in ionotropic glutamate receptor function has been recognized in a number of previous investigations (38Sommer B. Keinänen K. Verdoorn T.A. Wisden W. Burnashev N.

In fact, a segment of the M3-M4 linker has been assigned as the second of two lobes (S1 and S2) required for agonist binding, based on the homology between glutamate receptors and bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (8Kuryatov A.

An important consequence of our findings is that the designation of position 714 as part of the glycine binding pocket is not predicted by the recognized homology between glutamate receptors and the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (Fig. 1). This homology was used as a framework for the mutagenesis study that first revealed a contribution of the M3-M4 linker of the NMDA receptor to apparent glycine affinity (8Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The authors superimposed the NR1 sequence onto the known three-dimensional structure of a member of the class of bacterial proteins (the lysine/arginine/ornithine binding protein or LAOBP) to generate a structural model of the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor. The model was recently refined when several other residues in the M3-M4 linker were identified that affect apparent glycine affinity (14Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A detailed three-dimensional prediction of the structure of the glutamate binding site of non-NMDA receptors was recently produced (44Sutcliffe M. Wo Z.G. Oswald R. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1575-1589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This model was also based upon the known LAOBP structure. Hence, the same bacterial periplasmic binding protein homology has been used to make structural predictions about L-glutamate binding in non-NMDA receptors (15O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H.

A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, the binding site of the LAOBP protein accommodates only a single amino acid (46Oh B.-H. Pandit J. Kang C.-H. Nikaido K.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11348-11355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the NMDA receptor requires binding of two different amino acids for activation. Mutations in analogous amino-terminal S1 residues affected GluR1 L-glutamate affinity and NR1 glycine affinity similarly (8Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Several of the NMDA receptor S1 mutations producing large changes in glycine affinity also affected L-glutamate affinity. Thus, it has been argued that this homologous binding site is conserved among all ionotropic glutamate receptors (43Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that a lack of amino acid selectivity from the homologous binding region would be expected due to the nonselective nature of the bacterial proteins (43Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence argue that L-glutamate and glycine do not possess the same binding domain within the NMDA receptor. Both molecules are necessary to activate the receptor (3Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar, 4Kleckner N. Dingledine R. Science. 1988; 241: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Second, selective agonists and antagonists exist for each site (48Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar). Finally, although the sites are allosterically coupled (5Lester R.A.J. Tong G. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Priestly T. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1191-1196PubMed Google Scholar), our own results and those of others (8Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) demonstrate that it is possible to affect the apparent affinity of one of the co-agonists without affecting the other. There is evidence that two glycine molecules are necessary for activation of the native NMDA receptor complex (49Clements J.D. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1991; 7: 605-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Whether these ligands interact at two distinct molecular sites remains unknown. Dramatic shifts in the apparent affinity for glycine have been produced by mutations in the S1 segment of the NMDA receptor (8Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 50Wafford K.A. Kathoria M. Bain C.J. Marshall G. Le Bourdelles B. Kemp J.A. Whiting P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 374-380PubMed Google Scholar). The influence that position 714 exerts on glycine affinity may involve a second binding site or it may arise from interactions between the S1 and S2 segments. It is curious to note the lack of influence on glycine affinity imparted by amino acid charge at this position (see Fig. 6). Therefore, it is likely that position 714 does not directly contribute a contact point for glycine binding. Rather, the volume correlation suggests that large amino acids at position 714 obstruct the access of the ligand to its binding site through steric hindrance. Alternatively, Ala-714 could reside in a region that undergoes a conformational change following glycine binding. If the NMDA receptor undergoes a hinge-bending motion upon ligand binding similar to that proposed for the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (46Oh B.-H. Pandit J. Kang C.-H. Nikaido K. Gokcen S. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11348-11355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), then a large portion of the protein could become protected when the two lobes close. Such a mechanism could possibly explain ligand-induced protection from DTNB modification. However, it seems unlikely that such large-scale conformational changes are associated with binding of glycine, in the absence of L-glutamate, since this fails to activate the receptor. Because DTNB modification of A714C is protected by glycine but not L-glutamate, the alternative model would infer separate conformational alterations upon the binding of each agonist. Position 714 occurs in a region that does not possess homology with the bacterial proteins. The failure to consistently align this region of the glutamate receptor subunits with LAOBP is evidence for the lack of homology (Fig. 1). Furthermore, neither of the structural models of the NMDA receptor predicts any proximity of position 714 to the glycine binding site (8Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 14Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recently, mutation of another amino acid in the M3-M4 of the NR1 subunit has been found to impart large shifts in gycine affinity (51Williams K. Chao J. Kashiwagi K. Masuko T. Igarashi K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 701-708PubMed Google Scholar). This residue is not predicted to contribute to glycine binding by the structural models either. These structural models offer insufficient detail to identify the precise location of Ala-714. Inspection of the diagram in Fig. 4 of Hirai et al. (14Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) suggests, however, that position 714 is located in a beta-sheet domain quite removed from the predicted glycine contact points. Our results define position 714 as part of the glycine binding pocket. Since the region of the NMDA receptor that comprises the glycine binding pocket is distinct from the L-glutamate binding site, models based on bacterial protein homology cannot be expected to simultaneously predict both sites. Thus, although the recognized homology between ionotropic glutamate receptors and bacterial periplasmic binding proteins has contributed significantly to the current model of glutamate receptor structure, it may not serve to fully predict the complex nature of the NMDA receptor.

The enzyme hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP, an oxidized form of dGTP, to 8-oxo-dGMP, thereby preventing the occurrence of A:T to C:G transversion, caused by misincorporation. We isolated the mouse genomic sequence encoding the enzyme and elucidated its structure. The gene, named MTH1 for mutT homologue 1, is composed of at least five exons and spans approximately 9 kilobase pairs. A genomic region containing the pseudogene was also isolated. The promoter region for the gene is GC-rich, contains many AP-1 and AP-2 recognition sequences, and lacks a typical TATA box. Primer extension and S1 mapping analyses revealed the existence of multiple transcription initiation sites, among which a major site was defined as +1. The putative promoter region was placed upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, and control of expression of the gene was examined by introducing the construct into mouse NIH 3T3 cells. Deletion analysis indicated that a sequence from −321 to +9 carries the basic promoter activity while an adjacent region, spanning from +352 to +525 stimulates the frequency of transcription."

We have isolated and characterized a full-length p62 cDNA of 3374 base pairs which encodes an extremely acidic polypeptide of 411 amino acids having a calculated Mr of 46,388 and a pI of 4.01; p62 is a unique protein with no significant identity to any known proteins.

Currently, truncated clones of p62 are being used to identify the tubulin and chromatin binding domains. Controlled microtubule disassembly occurs during anaphase A, the stage of mitosis characterized by the movement of the chromosomes toward the poles, an event thought to be powered by molecular motors that reside at the kinetochores. The kinetochore microtubules selectively disassemble during anaphase A, and if the microtubules are prevented from disassembling, e.g. by treatment with the microtubule stabilizing, anti-tumor drug Taxol, then mitosis ceases. Microtubule depolymerization can be induced by calcium, and calcium has been shown to result in the shortening of the distance separating the poles and movement of the chromosomes toward the poles (1Salmon E.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 25: 69-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microtubule disassembly is necessary for the reactivation of chromosome movement in lysed cells (2Spurck T.P. Pickett-Heaps J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and isolated mitotic chromosomes can be translocated in association with a single microtubule in vitro as the result of microtubule depolymerization (3Koshland D.E. Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1988; 331: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4Coue M. Lambillo V.A. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, a critical step in anaphase is the controlled disassembly of the kinetochore microtubules. We have previously demonstrated that a protein of 62 kDa (p62), a substrate of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, is associated with the mitotic apparatus (5Dinsmore J.H. Sloboda R.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Dinsmore J.H. Sloboda R.D. Cell. 1989; 57: 127-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both p62 and the kinase responsible for its phosphorylation copurify with mitotic apparatuses isolated from first cell cycle sea urchin embryos (5Dinsmore J.H. Sloboda R.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Dinsmore J.H. Sloboda R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 582: 301-303Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Importantly, the phosphorylation of p62 has been shown to correlate directly with the disassembly of microtubules in isolated mitotic apparatuses (5Dinsmore J.H. Sloboda R.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microinjection of sea urchin embryos with affinity-purified antibodies to p62 inhibits progression through the cell cycle, specifically at the metaphase to anaphase transition (6Dinsmore J.H. Sloboda R.D. Cell. 1989; 57: 127-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because p62 is present at constant levels through at least two cell cycles (8Johnston J.A. Sloboda R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), p62 dephosphorylation must be due to the action of a specific phosphatase and not to the degradation of the protein, as occurs, for example, with the cyclins. In fact, the existence of protein phosphatase 1 in the mitotic apparatus isolated from sea urchin embryos that dephosphorylates p62 has been demonstrated by pharmacological studies with phosphatase inhibitors (9Johnston J.A. Sloboda R.D. Silver R.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 29: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Finally, the subcellular localization of p62 varies with the cell cycle. During mitosis, p62 is associated with the mitotic apparatus, particularly with the microtubules (6Dinsmore J.H. Sloboda R.D. Cell. 1989; 57: 127-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Johnston J.A. Sloboda R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 10Ye X. Sloboda R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), while during interphase, p62 resides in the nucleus (8Johnston J.A. Sloboda R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 10Ye X. Sloboda R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Based on this background, our working hypothesis is that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of p62 play key roles in controlling cell division, particularly during anaphase A, by permitting kinetochore microtubule disassembly at the appropriate time during mitosis. As the logical next step in elucidating the mode of action of p62 in mitosis, we present here a characterization of the polypeptide based on its deduced amino acid sequence obtained from cloned cDNA. The p62 polypeptide is highly acidic, yet contains distinct subdomains of alternating clusters of basic and acidic residues. Furthermore, confocal microscopy reveals that during interphase the protein binds to chromatin in the nuclei of sea urchin eggs; in the germinal vesicles of clam oocytes at prophase of meiosis I, p62 binds to the condensed chromosomes. Electroelution was used to purify p62, as described previously (10Ye X. Sloboda R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The purified, denatured protein was concentrated using a single Centricon-10 ultrafiltration device according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). Purified p62 (100 μl) was dialyzed against 0.5 M NH4HCO3 at 4°C overnight, lyophilized, and resuspended in 150 μl of 50 mg/ml CNBr (Eastman Kodak Co.) in 70% (v/v) formic acid and incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature.

Thirty microliters of reducing buffer (31.25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% pyronin Y) were added, and the sample was boiled for 4 min and resolved by electrophoresis on a 5-15% gradient polyacrylamide SDS-gel (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar).

Trypsin digestion of p62 blotted to Trans-Blot membrane (Bio-Rad) was used in a parallel approach to obtain sequence data from internal regions of p62. After electrophoresis and electroblotting, the membrane was rinsed with Milli-Q water three times for 5 min each, then immersed for 1 min in a solution containing 0.1% Amido Black in 10% acetic acid and destained for 1 min in 5% acetic acid. The band corresponding to p62 was excised, rinsed with Milli-Q water, air-dried, and sent to the Wistar Protein Microchemistry Laboratory at the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA) where in situ proteolytic digestion of p62 with trypsin was performed. Three peptides identified by HPLC from the tryptic digest were chosen, isolated, and sequenced in a gas phase sequenator. A sea urchin λZAP cDNA library provided courtesy of Dr. Jonathan Scholey (University of California, Davis) was screened (12Young R.A. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) with affinity-purified p62 polyclonal antibodies (see Ye and Sloboda (10Ye X. Sloboda R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) for antibody characterization) that had been preabsorbed with an Escherichia coli/phage lysate. One positive clone, λZAP h1, was identified using this procedure. The pBluescript SK− containing the h1 clone was removed from the λZAP vector by in vivo excision, and the resulting clone was named SKh1. As an initial step in clone verification, the fusion protein produced by λZAP h1 was used to affinity purify antibodies from a crude antiserum obtained from a second rabbit, different than the one that produced the antibodies used for library screening. Two regions with minimal codon degeneracy of the longest tryptic peptide of p62, Trp-3, were chosen to design degenerate sense and antisense primers for use in PCR. The sequence of the Trp-3 peptide is NH2-DDDRNVIEVETINFDGDTVIQPLLSLR-COOH. The sense primer, referred to as 3Aup (5′-GAYGAYGAYMGIAAYGTIAT-3′, where I = inosine, M = A + C, and Y = C + T), was designed from the first seven residues of the Trp-3 peptide. The antisense primer, referred to as 3Adown (5′-ARIGGYTGDATIACIGTRTC-3′, where D = A + G + T and R = A + G), was designed from residues 17-23 of the Trp-3 peptide. Finally, a pool of 26-mer degenerate oligonucleotides, referred to as 3A (5′GARGTIGARACIATIAAYTTYGAYGG-3′), was designed from residues 8-16 in the internal sequence of Trp-3. The 3A oligos were used to screen sequences generated by the PCR reaction using the 3Aup and 3Adown primers. cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)-rich RNA of unfertilized sea urchin eggs using an oligo(dT)16 primer in a reverse transcription reaction and was then subjected to two rounds of PCR amplification using primer pair 3Aup and 3Adown. Analysis of the amplified PCR products showed a diffuse band in the expected size range of 68 base pairs. The 68-base pair PCR product was subcloned into the pCR™ vector (Invitrogen), and the resulting colonies were screened by hybridization for a specific PCR product using γ-32P-end-labeled 3A oligonucleotides; positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. One such colony, named TA 8, was shown by sequence analysis to contain a specific DNA that could be translated into 23 amino acids identical in sequence to the Trp-3 peptide. Clone TA 8 was then used to screen the cDNA library by plaque hybridization. Plasmid DNA was isolated from recombinant clones using the plasmid mini kit from Qiagen and sequenced via the dideoxy chain termination method on an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated sequencer. Either vector-specific or custom oligonucleotide primers were used to sequence the cDNA clones in primer-directed sequencing using the Taq Dye Primer cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). All clones were sequenced at least twice on each strand. Sequence analysis was performed using the programs of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UW GCG) software package (13Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). The FASTA (14Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequence comparison was performed using BESTFIT of the GCG software. Coupled in vitro transcription and translation was performed with 1 μg of cloned DNA in the reticulocyte lysate-based TNT system (Promega, Madison WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine essentially as described by the manufacturer except as follows. The luciferase-directed reaction was driven by the T3 promoter at 30°C for 120 min. The SKh11-directed reactions were incubated with either T3 or T7 polymerase in reticulocyte lysate at 37°C for 30 min and then at 30°C for 90 min. The products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, the gel dried, and the translation products detected by PhosphorImaging (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Sea urchins of the genus Strongylocentrotus purpuratus were purchased from Marinus, Inc. (Westchester, CA). Spawning, fertilization, and embryo culture were carried out in 0.45 μm Millipore-filtered sea water at 15°C. Embryos were collected at various stages, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Total RNA kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen). About 15 μg of total RNA from each sample were denatured at 65°C for 20 min and then subjected to electrophoresis on a formaldehyde/agarose gel. The resolved RNA was blotted onto nitrocellulose by capillary transfer and prehybridized at 42°C for 4 h in 2.5 × prehybridization mix (1 × mix is 25 mM PIPES, 2 M NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) each of Sarkosyl, polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, bovine serum albumin, and Ficoll 400), 50% formamide, and 0.2 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. RNA on the membrane was hybridized with probe at a specific activity of 2.0 × 106 cpm/ml in the above-described buffer containing 10% dextran sulfate for 48 h at 42°C. The probe corresponded to the entire p62 cDNA that had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using Ready-To-Go™ DNA labeling beads from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and dCTP. After hybridization, the membrane was washed once for 30 min in 2 × SSC, 750 μM sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.05% (w/v) Sarkosyl at room temperature and four times, for 30 min each, in 0.1 X SSC, 375 μM sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.05% (w/v) Sarkosyl at 50°C, and then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 2 h at room temperature. Genomic DNA was isolated from unfertilized sea urchin eggs by the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) DNA extraction protocol provided by Dr. Kathy Foltz, University of California, Santa Barbara, as follows: 100 μl of packed eggs were resuspended in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with 700 μl of prewarmed (60°C) CTAB lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2% CTAB [w/v], 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, Mr 360,000 (polyvinylpyrrolidone-360 (w/v), and 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol (the latter added just before use). The tube was incubated at 60°C for 30 to 60 min. The lysate was extracted with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), followed by chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). After extraction, the aqueous layer was transferred to a new tube and mixed with two-thirds volume of ice cold isopropanol to precipitate genomic DNA, which was sedimented by centrifugation for 5 min at room temperature. The pellet was washed in 500 μl of wash buffer (76% ethanol, 10 mM ammonium acetate) at room temperature for 5 min. After a brief centrifugation, the DNA pellet was dried using a Speed Vac® (Savant Instruments, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) and resuspended in 30 μl of TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Twenty micrograms of genomic DNA were digested to completion with EcoRI, KpnI, or HindIII and electrophoresed on an 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was treated with 0.25 N HCl for 15 min, denatured for 30 min in 1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH, and neutralized for 30 min in 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After rinsing the gel in 2 × SSC, the DNA was transferred to nitrocellulose by capillary transfer in 20 × SSC. The membrane was prehybridized at 65°C in prehybridization solution (see previous section), then hybridized with 32P-labeled p62 cDNA in the same solution at 65°C for 12 h. After hybridization, the membrane was washed at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, four times, for 30 min each, then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen at room temperature overnight. Sea urchin nuclei were isolated with membranes intact from Lytechinus pictus eggs (8Johnston J.A. Sloboda R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Germinal vesicles were isolated from oocytes of the surf clam Spisula solidissima as follows. Oocytes were washed three to four times in seawater. One milliliter of packed oocytes was collected by centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge at maximum speed, washed for 30 s in 1 M glycerol, then washed for 60-90 s in 1 M glycerol, 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0. Oocytes were resuspended in 20 volumes of Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 50 mM PIPES, pH 6.9, 0.75 mM MgSO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 160 μM Pefabloc, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), applied over a 0.4 M sucrose in 50 mM PIPES, pH 6.9, cushion, and centrifuged for 10 min in a clinical centrifuge at three-fourths speed. The germinal vesicles in the pellet were washed several times by resuspension and sedimentation through sucrose. Isolated nuclei or germinal vesicles were fixed in 90% methanol, 50 mM EGTA at −20°C, and processed for indirect double label immunofluorescence (10Ye X. Sloboda R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) using a mixture of affinity purified antibodies to p62 and DNA antibodies, the latter kindly provided by Dr. Robert Goldman (Northwest University Medical School). Secondary antibodies were a mixture of fluorescein-labeled goat anti-human antibodies and rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies. Slides were viewed using an LSM-410 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope from Carl Zeiss, Inc. Purified p62 was cleaved with CNBr to yield two cleavage products, pL and pS, with estimated molecular masses of 36 and 20 kDa, respectively. These peptides were specific to CNBr cleavage as they were absent from control samples which revealed slight degradation of p62 due to formic acid alone. Digestion with CNBr also generated several other peptides that were detectable on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-gels, but these were not efficiently transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. When a duplicate gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with affinity purified p62 antibodies, both pL and pS as well as several smaller peptides were recognized by the antibodies. When phosphorylated p62 was cleaved with CNBr, peptides pL and pS were radioactive, indicating they contained one or more residues that could be phosphorylated under the conditions employed in the in vitro phosphorylation reaction of p62 (5Dinsmore J.H. Sloboda R.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This observation also indicates that p62 is phosphorylated in vitro at more than one site, assuming that the CNBr cleavage reaction went to completion. Peptides pL and pS were sequenced, and five sequential residues from each peptide were obtained with confidence. These sequences were named CNBr-1 (NH2-AKEYF-COOH) and CNBr-2 (NH2-KGKGD-COOH). Tryptic peptides were generated and purified by HPLC. Three peptides were selected, sequenced, and the resulting peptide sequences were called Trp-1 (NH2-LGLNESTNLDIGLQPPVT-COOH), Trp-2 (NH2-NVIEVETINFDGETVIQPLLSLR-COOH), and Trp-3 (NH2-DDDRNVIEVETINFDGETVIQPLLSLR-COOH). Note that Trp-2 is a fragment of Trp-3 formed by cleavage after an Arg residue found at position number four of Trp-3. Two approaches, an antibody screen and a PCR-based screen, were used simultaneously to identify p62 clones from a sea urchin cDNA library. Both approaches identified the same clone, SKh1, which encodes tryptic peptides Trp-1 and Trp-3, as well as the CNBr-derived peptides, CNBr-1 and CNBr-2, and contains an open reading frame of 225 residues (25 kDa). However, the 225-residue open reading frame extends to the 3′ end of the clone, there is no in frame stop codon, poly(A) addition signal, or poly(A) tail. Thus, SKh1 is a partial cDNA clone of p62, and thus could be used to rescreen the cDNA library to identify a full-length clone. Using this partial cDNA as a probe, an additional 24 positive clones were obtained by hybridization screening. Clone SKh11, with the largest insert, was sequenced completely, and the sequence and deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1. SKh11 is composed of 3374 bases, and contains a single open reading frame encoding 411 amino acid residues which is preceded by 173 bases of 5′-untranslated region. The open reading frame is followed by a 3′-untranslated region of 1968 bases that terminates in a short poly(A) sequence. The correct reading frame of p62 was specified both by this single, long, open translation unit and by the presence of all four microsequenced peptide sequences in this reading frame (Fig. 1). The first ATG in the open reading frame, at nucleotide position 174 of SKh11, is in the proper context for eukaryotic initiation. The ATG is preceded by an A at the −3 position, where a purine residue has been shown to be important for the initiation of translation (16Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 266: 8125-8148Crossref Scopus (4168) Google Scholar), and a G at the +4 position (17Cavener D.R. Ray S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Upstream of this ATG there exist five, in-frame stop codons (at nucleotide positions 6, 96, 111, 126, and 132). Although five additional in-frame ATGs (at nucleotide positions 702, 1038, 1102, 1227, and 1260) are also present, these ATGs either lack the consensus sequence for optimal translational initiation, a feature that becomes important in the analysis of eukaryotic translation, or encode small peptides that do not contain p62 tryptic and CNBr peptide sequences. Therefore, none of these codons represent translational initiation sites for intact p62. The coding region is terminated by a stop codon (TGA) at nucleotide position 1407; a series of TGAs follow throughout the entire extended 3′-untranslated region. The 3′-untranslated region includes three putative poly(A) addition signals (ATTAAA) at nucleotide positions 2337, 2385, and 3336, and a short poly(A) tail of nine bases. The ATTAAA at nucleotide position 3336 is located 24-base pairs upstream of the poly(A) tail, and thus has a high potential to be the polyadenylation signal. The other two polyadenylation signals are most likely not used, at least by the transcript that generated clone SKh11, as they are >35 bases upstream of the poly(A) tail. Furthermore, no correspondingly smaller species of mRNA were detected by Northern blot analysis (see Fig. 3). Thus, it is doubtful that those signals are functional in vivo, at least in early embryos. All of the above demonstrate that SKh11 represents a full-length cDNA clone of p62.Fig. 3Northern blot analysis of p62 transcripts in eggs and embryos of the sea urchin. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA from unfertilized sea urchin eggs and embryos at various stages of development were resolved by electrophoresis in a formaldehyde/agarose gel. The RNAs were transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized in 50% formamide at 42°C with a DNA probe obtained from the full-length cDNA clone SKh11, prepared by random primer labeling of the insert from SKh11.

On SDS-gels, p62 has been estimated to have a Mr of 62,000 (5Dinsmore J.H. Sloboda R.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular mass predicted from the sequence of SKh11 is 16 kDa less than the apparent molecular mass estimated from SDS-gels. Although phosphorylation may contribute to the anomalous migration of a given protein on SDS-gels (18Gates R.F. King L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), this 16-kDa discrepancy in molecular mass of p62 most likely results from the regions in the primary sequence that are extraordinarily rich in acidic residues. Indeed, highly acidic amino acid sequences can cause large anomalous migrations of proteins on SDS-gels. This has been inferred intuitively, as such proteins bind SDS with relatively low efficiency, and demonstrated directly by fusion studies using cloned CENP-B cDNAs (19Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1479-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To confirm directly that the acidic character of p62 is responsible for this migration anomaly, the insert from clone SKh11 was transcribed and translated. When the T7 promoter in SKh11 is used to drive a coupled transcription-translation reaction with reticulocyte lysate, a T7 dependent polypeptide is produced that migrates on SDS gels at Mr 62,000 (Fig. 2, lane B). No similar product is produced when T3 polymerase, whose promoter lies downstream of the insert, is used as the negative control (Fig. 2, lane A). The positive translation control for this experiment is luciferase, having a Mr of 61,000 (Fig. 2, lane C). Thus, these data show that the large molecular weight of p62 estimated from SDS-gels is most likely due to anomalous SDS binding, and support the conclusion that SKh11 is a full-length cDNA clone of p62. Northern blot analysis was performed to determine the size and expression of p62 mRNA during early development in the sea urchin embryo. High stringency hybridization between the insert of SKh11 and total RNA identified a 3.5-kilobase message in unfertilized eggs and in embryos at all stages of development investigated (Fig. 3). It is clear that the p62 message is present maternally in unfertilized eggs and throughout development up to the gastrula stage. Only one mRNA transcript was detected during early development in the sea urchin. The size of the message corresponds to that of the insert of clone SKh11, indicating that the cloned cDNA corresponds to a full-length transcript. To determine the copy number of the gene encoding p62 in the sea urchin genome, as well as to identify related genes, high molecular mass DNA from unfertilized sea urchin eggs was digested with EcoRI, KpnI, or HindIII, and probed with the insert from SKh11. The resultant autoradiogram is shown in Fig. 4. The hybridization pattern was the same under all stringency conditions tested suggesting that there are no other sequences in the sea urchin genome related to p62. Note that the recognition sites for EcoRI and KpnI are not found within clone SKh11, whereas HindIII is present once in SKh11 (nucleotides 831-836). These data show that the gene encoding p62 is presence once in the sea urchin genome. Analysis of the amino acid composition reveals that the p62 polypeptide is rich in glutamy"

When placed upstream of the TATA box, the nTPE has very little effect on transcription. However, it inhibits transcription when placed at several positions downstream of the TATA box. Mechanistic studies with the TBP promoter suggest that binding of TPBF to the nTPE not only prevents TBP from binding to the TATA box but also displaces bound TBP, thereby inhibiting further assembly of the preinitiation complex.

Modulation of gene expression at the level of transcription initiation is a major regulatory strategy for eukaryotic cells to control their responses to intra- or extracellular stimuli. Similarly, the level of production of housekeeping genes is also tightly regulated at the level of promoter efficiency. Transcription initiation on eukaryotic promoters involves the sequential addition of individual transcription factors through protein-DNA and/or protein-protein interactions (1Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). While accurate initiation of transcription from most eukaryotic class II promoters requires RNA polymerase II as well as a set of general transcription factors that includes TFIID, 1The abbreviations used are: TFtranscription factorTBPTATA-binding proteinTPETBP promoter elementnTPEnegative TPETPBFTBP promoter-binding factorPCRpolymerase chain reactionDTTdithiothreitol. TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH (2Buratowski S. Cell. 1994; 77: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), the level of transcription is mainly regulated by DNA-binding, sequence-specific transcription factors, also known as activators or repressors. Sequence-specific transcription factors bind to promoter elements via DNA-binding motifs and modulate transcription positively or negatively through direct or indirect (via coactivators) communication with the general transcription machinery (3Struhl K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 651-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Most promoter elements are recognized by one single transcription factor. However, there are several examples in which one promoter element can be recognized by multiple factors or seemingly unrelated DNA elements can be recognized by a single factor (4Qasba P. Lin E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the cDNA encoding TPBF was subsequently isolated (23Huang W. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28839-28847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). TPBF is a novel tetrameric DNA-binding protein. It contains a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which drives tetramerization. The pattern of protein-DNA contacts between tetrameric TPBF and TPE, which resembles the proposed model for the interaction between the p53 tetramer and its target DNA (24Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), is distinct from that produced by other coiled-coil transcription factors (22Liu F. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our domain mapping studies also suggest that TPBF, like p53, has an apparently large central region involved in specific DNA binding. TPBF is likely to bind to other Acanthamoeba promoter elements such as that of the polyubiquitin gene, which contains a near perfect TPE (25Hu Q. Henney Jr., R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; Google Scholar). Several previous observations suggested, but did not prove, that TBP gene expression is subject to negative control by a TPBF-binding element between positions −5 and −19 of the TBP gene promoter. First, in vitro transcription of the TBP gene is surprisingly efficient given the low abundance of TBP mRNA in vivo (17Wong J. Liu F. Bateman E. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Second, analyses of 3′ deletions showed that removal of sequences between positions −5 and −19 of the TBP gene promoter results in a 10-fold increase in transcription efficiency (26Wong J. Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4817-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 2W. Huang and E. Bateman, unpublished results. Third, DNase I footprinting showed that at high concentrations TPBF can bind to several sites within the TBP gene promoter including the region between the TATA box and the start site (22Liu F. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the addition of recombinant TPBF to extracts partly depleted of TPBF failed to show the expected stimulation of transcription in vitro Here we report the identification and characterization of another major cis-element, the nTPE, which is located between the TATA box and the transcription initiation site. The nTPE exerts a strong negative effect on TBP gene transcription in vitro The nTPE is structurally similar to the TPE and is also specifically bound by TPBF. Comparison of TPBF binding affinities suggests that TPBF can sequentially bind to these two elements and thereby modulate TBP gene expression. By adding TPBF back into TPBF-free nuclear extracts, we show that the TPBF concentration determines the level of TBP gene transcription. Finally, we suggest a mechanism of TPBF-induced repression by showing that TPBF, when bound to the nTPE, actively displaces TBP from the TATA box. A working model of how TPBF regulates TBP gene expression is presented. The oligonucleotides used in this research were as follows: TPEu, 5′-AACAAGCTGAGAAAAAACCAGGATCGG-3′; TPEb, 5′-CCGATCCTGGTTTTTTCTCAGCTTGTT-3′; mTPEu, 5′-AACCAGCTGAGAAACAACCAGGATAGG-3′; mTPEb, 5′-CCTATCCTGGTTGTTTCTCAGCTGGTT-3′; nTPEu, 5′-AAGGGGCCAATTTTTTTGTTGATTTGTTG-3′; nTPEb, 5′-CAACAAATCAACAAAAAAATTGGCCCCTT-3′; nTPEm, 5′-CAACAAATCAACGCTCGCGTTGGCCCCTT-3′; RTA3, 5′-CAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′; RTA4, 5′-GCGATTAAGTTGGGTAACGCCAGGGTTT-3′; TBP, 5′-CGCCATGCCCGCGCTCTGAAGGACATTCGT-3′; Rev, 5′-AACAGCTATGACCATG-3′, T7 5′-AATACGACTCACTATAG-3′; KS, 5′-CGAGGTCGACGGTATCG-3′. The DNA fragment for making the nTPE linker-scanning mutant was generated by PCR amplification of a wild type TBP promoter using primers TPEu and nTPEm. A linker-scanning mutant was then constructed by inserting the fragment into the EcoRV site of the pSK(−) vector. Similarly, a wild type control construct was generated by using primers TPEu and nTPEb. Plasmid TATA1 was made by inserting a synthetic TATA box (-TATATAAG-) into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pSK(−) vector. Plasmids TATA1-TPEa, TATA1-TPEb, and TATA1-TPEc were derived from plasmid TATA1 by insertion of double-stranded TPE DNA into the HincII, EcoRV, and KpnI sites, respectively. The same approach was used to generate plasmids TATA1-nTPEa, TATA1-nTPEb, and TATA1-nTPEc. 1 mg of purified, recombinant TPBF was fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was quickly stained with 0.2% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid. The TPBF band was cut out, and the remaining stain was removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. The 1 × 5-cm strip containing TPBF was blocked in 20 ml of 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min with gentle agitation and then washed three times, each for 5 min, using 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The strip was placed in a 15-ml centrifuge tube and incubated with 3 ml of crude rabbit anti-TPBF serum at 4°C overnight (23Huang W. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28839-28847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After the serum was removed, the strip was washed three times using 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Antibodies were eluted by incubation with 1 ml of 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.5), 100 mM NaCl at 4°C for 30 min. Purified antibodies were quickly neutralized to pH 7.0 by adding 6 M NaOH. Affinity-purified TPBF antibodies were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) under the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. Immunodepletion was carried out in a minicolumn containing 1 ml of antibody-coupled Sepharose 4B resin at 4°C. The column was equilibrated with CB100 (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM DTT, and 100 mM KCl). 1 ml of Acanthamoeba nuclear extract (∼5 mg in CB100) was loaded, and the flow-through was collected and subjected to another cycle of affinity chromatography. TPBF was quantitatively removed as confirmed by immunoblotting (23Huang W. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28839-28847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Transcription and primer extension assays were performed essentially as described (21Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Huang W. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28839-28847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 ng of supercoiled plasmid templates were incubated with 50 μg of Acanthamoeba nuclear extracts in 50-μl reactions containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 75 mM potassium acetate, 0.02 mM EDTA, 2% glycerol, 1 unit of RNasin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.4 mM each NTP. Reactions were carried out at 30°C for 1 h. Transcripts were extracted with phenol-chloroform twice, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 10 μl of annealing buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 400 mM KCl, and 50,000-100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled primer. Annealing was performed by slowly cooling from 65°C to room temperature. Primer extensions were started by adding 4 μl of 10 × RT buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 60 mM MgCl2, 25 mM DTT), 4 μl of dNTPs (2.5 mM each), 1 unit of RNasin, and 20 units of Superscript II into a total volume of 40 μl, followed by incubation for 1 h at 45°C. Primer extension products were precipitated and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel in TBE buffer (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). Purifications of recombinant TPBF and TBP proteins were performed essentially as described elsewhere (23Huang W. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28839-28847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 28Wong J. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pET3a vector containing the TPBF or TBP cDNA was freshly transformed into Escherichia coli strain LE392. The E. coli cells were grown to an A600 of 0.8 and infected with λCE6 (Novagen). Cells were harvested after 3.5 h of infection, and the cells were lysed by sonication. For TPBF purification, the cell lysate was subjected to nickel affinity chromatography. TPBF was eluted with 300 mM imidazole (pH 7.5). Fractions containing TPBF were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon 10 spin column (Amicon). Purified proteins were stored at −70°C in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For the production of recombinant Acanthamoeba TBP, the cell lysate was applied to DEAE-cellulose (Whatman) equilibrated with column buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM benzamidine, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 200 mM KCl. The flow-through was collected and applied to an Affi-gel heparin column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with column buffer containing 200 mM KCl. TBP was eluted with column buffer containing 500 mM KCl. Active fractions, as judged by mobility shift assay, were pooled together and dialyzed against column buffer containing 100 mM KCl. TBP was purified to ∼80% homogeneity. Approximately 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled probe was mixed with the indicated amount of protein in each reaction. The binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 15 μl containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mM DTT at 30°C for 20 min. In the experiments shown in Fig. 6, HindIII treatment was done by adding 10 units of enzyme and incubating for an additional 10 min. Probes containing single TPE or nTPE elements were produced by annealing appropriate complementary oligonucleotides and end-labeling using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Full-length TBP promoter was made by PCR amplification from the plasmid template TBP-97 (21Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) using primers TPEu and nTPEb. TPE-nTPE probe containing a HindIII site was made by inserting TPE and nTPE elements into the EcoRV and HincII sites of the pSK(−) vector, respectively, and then amplified using primers TPEu and nTPEu. All PCR products were gel-purified and labeled with 32P. Probe TPE-nTPE labeled with 32P at either the TPE side or the nTPE side was generated by PCR using an appropriate 32P-labeled primer and its corresponding pair. Probe TATA-nTPE was generated by PCR amplification of TBP-35 template (21Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) using primers KS and nTPEb. Inspection of the DNA sequence between the TATA box and the transcription initiation site of the TBP gene promoter identifies a sequence that is similar to the upstream TPBF recognition site, the TPE, but inverted (Fig. 1A). In order to consolidate earlier results (see the Introduction) and to establish that this sequence functions as a negative element in the context of the native TBP gene promoter, we made a linker-scanning mutant in which the run of T nucleotides between nucleotides −14 and −8 of the TBP promoter are replaced with 5′-CGCGAGC-3′ (Fig. 1B, top). The promoter activity of the linker-scanning mutant was tested by in vitro transcription and was found to be 4-fold higher than that of a wild type promoter (Fig. 1B, bottom). This result clearly demonstrates that the sequence is a negative element in the context of the TBP promoter. The 4-fold effect of the linker-scanning mutagenesis is less than the 10-fold effect found with a simple deletion to −19 (26Wong J. Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4817-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This could be because the TPE-related sequence is not completely disrupted by linker scanning. However, as shown below, the nTPE is both necessary and sufficient for negative regulation of the TBP gene. Alignment of the TPE, as defined by chemical interference (22Liu F. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the inhibitory sequence between the TATA box and the transcription start site, shows that 13 out of 23 base pairs are identical between these two sequences (Fig. 2A). The inhibitory sequence contains half of the bases that form contacts with TPBF as suggested by chemical interference assays on the TPE sequence (22Liu F. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since this sequence can inhibit transcription, we refer to it as the nTPE. The possibility that the nTPE is specifically recognized by TPBF was suggested by its striking sequence similarity to the TPE. In order to directly demonstrate that TPBF can bind to the nTPE, a pair of complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides −24 to +2 of the TBP promoter were synthesized. Mobility shift assays using purified recombinant TPBF clearly show an interaction between the nTPE and TPBF (Fig. 2B, lane 3). The interaction was specific, as suggested by both antibody supershift and competition experiments in which the TPE, but not a mutant TPE, prevent binding to the nTPE (Fig. 2B). A TPBF deletion mutant, in which the tetramerization region is removed, totally abolished the interaction, indicating that TPBF tetramerization is also necessary for nTPE binding. Moreover, the complex between TPBF and the nTPE has the same mobility as the complex between TPBF and the TPE. We infer that TPBF binds to the nTPE as a tetramer as well. In order to further characterize the nTPE and understand its function in TBP gene expression, we compared the affinities of TPBF binding to the TPE and to the nTPE. A TPBF titration experiment was done with identical amounts of either the TPE or the nTPE in mobility shift assays (Fig. 3). Quantitative analyses of the intensity of the shifted bands indicated that 10-fold more TPBF was needed for the nTPE probe to achieve the same level of occupancy as the TPE probe. The affinity between TPBF and the TPE is therefore approximately 10-fold higher than that between TPBF and the nTPE. The difference in binding affinities between TPBF and these two binding sites provides a hypothetical basis for regulation of TBP gene expression by TPBF. At low concentration, TPBF predominantly occupies the high affinity site that leads to transcription activation. At higher concentrations, it occupies both binding sites and inhibits transcription. To directly test this hypothesis, we synthesized a probe containing both the TPE and the nTPE with a HindIII site between them (Fig. 4, top). When the probe was tested for TPBF binding using a mobility shift assay, we observed one single complex at low TPBF concentration (Fig. 4). With increasing amounts of TPBF, a second higher molecular weight complex appeared. A smooth transition from the lower molecular weight complex to the higher molecular weight complex was observed as the TPBF concentration increased. When the TPBF amount reached 100 ng, only the higher molecular weight complex, corresponding to occupancy of both sites, was present. In order to determine the order of TPBF binding to the TPE and nTPE sites, we labeled the probe at either the TPE end or the nTPE end and incubated it with TPBF at a concentration that only generated the lower molecular weight complex (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 9). When the binding reactions were treated with HindIII, the band between TPBF and the nTPE end-labeled probe completely disappeared (Fig. 4, lane 8), suggesting that the band was not due to binding to the nTPE. This was confirmed by the result that the band between TPBF and the TPE end-labeled probe was retained after HindIII digestion (Fig. 4, lane 1). A minor molecular weight change occurred because of trimming of the probe (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 2). These data demonstrate that at low concentration TPBF only binds to the TPE site and that binding to both sites occurs only when the TPBF concentration reaches a certain threshold. We have failed to observe any evidence for cooperative binding by TPBF to the TPE and nTPE in any context (data not shown). To further investigate how the nTPE inhibits transcription and to demonstrate that the nTPE is sufficient for repression, we analyzed the effect of the nTPE on transcription when it is positioned at various sites within a heterologous promoter. The promoter that we used contains a synthetic TATA box, which is able to direct RNA polymerase II transcription in both orientations. In previous studies we showed that the positive element, the TPE, is able to stimulate downstream transcription and inhibit transcription toward it in this promoter context (29Huang W. Wong J. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we tested whether the nTPE has similar effects on bidirectional transcription as those of the TPE. We subcloned the nTPE DNA fragment into three different sites (Fig. 5, top), which are 15, 36, and 55 base pairs downstream of the TATA box, respectively, and analyzed the effect of the nTPE on transcription. We employed a primer derived from the pSK(−) vector sequence and assayed the transcription activity of the constructs by primer extension. As shown in Fig. 5, the nTPE was able to repress transcription toward it in any of these three positions as efficiently as the TPE (Fig. 5, compare lanes 12-14 with lanes 9-11). However, unlike the TPE, which is able to stimulate downstream transcription severalfold (Fig. 5, compare lane 1 with lanes 2-4), the nTPE was not able to either activate or repress downstream transcription in any of these positions (Fig. 5, compare lane 1 with lanes 5-7). These data demonstrate that 1) the nTPE alone is a potent inhibitory element; 2) TPBF-induced repression occurs only when its binding site is located downstream of the TATA box, while activation requires the binding site located upstream of the TATA box; and 3) TPBF-induced activation depends on high affinity binding, whereas repression does not. Thus, binding of TPBF to its proximal target sequences is necessary but not sufficient to activate transcription. This was also suggested by the fact that another sequence located between the TPE and the TATA box, although bound by TPBF, does not exert any evident effect on transcription (21Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The role of this nonfunctional TPBF binding element in the TBP promoter is unclear. Although TPBF can bind to both the TPE and the nTPE, it was possible that other proteins were also responsible for their effects on transcription. To directly examine the effect of TPBF on activation and repression, we established a TPBF-free Acanthamoeba nuclear extract. As shown in Fig. 6A, we depleted TPBF from a nuclear extract using an affinity-purified anti-TPBF column. Immunodepletion completely removed TPBF (Fig. 6A, left) while not affecting the level of TBP or basal transcription (Fig. 6A, middle and right). We then compared levels of activated transcription supported by the TPBF-depleted nuclear extract with levels supported by normal nuclear extract from promoters containing a TPE. For both the natural TBP promoter and the TATA1-TPEa promoter, depletion of TPBF from the nuclear extract completely abolished the elevated transcription level that was observed with the control nuclear extract (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 5 and 6). The direct involvement of TPBF in transcription repression was also investigated by assaying transcription toward the TPE in the TATA1-TPEa promoter (Fig. 6B, lanes 9-12). We detected at least a 5-fold transcription recovery after TPBF was removed from nuclear extract (Fig. 6B, compare lanes 9 and 10). To further establish that TPBF is directly responsible for activation and repression, we added purified recombinant TPBF to the TPBF-depleted nuclear extract. We were able to successfully recover both activation and repression with the TATA1-TPEa promoter by adding 100 or 200 ng of recombinant TPBF (Fig. 6B, lanes 7, 8, 11, and 12). However, we were unable to recover activation from a wild type TBP promoter by adding the same amounts of recombinant TPBF (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 4). These contradictory results prompted us to analyze the role of TPBF in a minimal TBP promoter (TBP-35) that retains the nTPE (Fig. 6C). Transcription of TBP-35 increased when TPBF was removed from nuclear extracts by immunodepletion (Fig. 6C, lanes 1 and 2). The increase was eliminated by adding back 50 ng of recombinant TPBF (Fig. 6C, lanes 3-5). The activity of TBP-35 was further repressed by adding 100 or 200 ng of TPBF (Fig. 6C, lanes 6 and 7). Overall, the above data demonstrate the presence of both positive and negative TPBF response elements in the TBP gene promoter and show that adding back TPBF has different effects on activation and repression, depe"

We have already demonstrated the precursor-product relationship between sulfated SgII and four N-terminal derived peptides in GH3B6 prolactin cells. In this study, we have investigated the subcellular compartment in which the cleavage of SgII is initiated by taking advantage of its tyrosine sulfation in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In order to prevent export of radiosulfated SgII from the TGN, we used brefeldin A (BFA) as well as incubation at 20°C. BFA completely inhibited the cleavage of SgII when added immediately post-pulse. BFA added a few minutes post-pulse or after a 20°C incubation, however, permitted the cleavage of SgII in the presence of the drug. These SgII-derived peptides generated in the presence of BFA could not be released upon stimulation of the cells by either thyroliberin, a physiological secretagogue, or KCl. These results demonstrate that SgII can be cleaved in the TGN. They also evidence that the cleavage occurs in a distal compartment of the TGN different from the sulfation site.

Bioactive peptides and hormones secreted by neurons and neuroendocrine cells are synthesized as precursors that must undergo post-translational processing before their release. The different steps of this processing occur during the vectorial transport of the proteins from the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where they are synthesized, to the secretory granules, in which they are stored. Proteolytic processing of the precursors is one of the last of these post-translational modifications. Although it occurs mainly in the secretory granules, it can be initiated in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkSgIIsecretogranin IITRHthyroliberinPCprohormone convertaseBFAbrefeldin APAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

The terminal sulfated fragment is a 21-kDa protein that is accumulated in the secretory granules and released upon stimulation by thyroliberin (TRH), a prolactin secretagogue, or KCl. The processing of SgII is fast, and more than 70% of mature SgII is cleaved 30 min after a 5-min pulse with [35S]sulfate (19Muller L. Tougard C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the tyrosine sulfation of SgII to study the intracellular site of its proteolytic processing. Indeed, sulfation is a post-translational modification specific to the TGN (20Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Spiro R.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pulse-labeling PC12 cells with [35S]sulfate has already allowed the use of sulfated SgII as a marker of intracellular transport between the TGN and the plasma membrane via the dense core secretory granules (23Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Cell. 1990; 60: 837-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 24Miller S.G. Moore H.P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Grimes M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PC12 cells, however, lack the prohormone convertases PC1 and PC2, which are involved in the processing of SgII (26Dittié A.S. Tooze S.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Hoflehner J. Eder U. Laslop A. Seidah N.G. Fischer-Colbrie R. Winkler H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our experiments were performed in GH3B6 cells, a subclone of GH3 cells, which express PC2 but not PC1 (28Seidah N.G. Gaspar L. Mion P. Marcinkiewicz M. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cultivating these cells in the presence of insulin, 17β-estradiol, and epidermal growth factor increases the number of secretory granules (29Scammel J.G. Burrage T.G. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the expression of PC2 (28Seidah N.G. Gaspar L. Mion P. Marcinkiewicz M. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and the storage of SgII-derived peptides in the granules (19Muller L. Tougard C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). GH3B6 cells therefore provide an ideal model for studying the proteolytic processing of SgII in the TGN and secretory granules. We used brefeldin A (BFA) and 20°C incubation to block anterograde transport of sulfated proteins in the TGN. We have already described the effect of these treatments on the distribution and secretion of prolactin in GH3B6 cells (30Nasciutti L.E. Picart R. Rosenbaum E. Tixier-Vidal A. Tougard C. Biol. Cell. 1992; 75: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). BFA is a fungal metabolite that blocks anterograde transport of proteins at different steps of the secretory pathway (reviewed in Ref. 31Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). It inhibits the formation of secretory vesicles and granules from the TGN, without preventing the exocytosis of the secretory granules stored in the cytoplasm (8Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20838-20844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Miller S.G. Carnell L. Moore H.P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 33Rosa P. Barr F.A. Stinchcombe J.C. Binacchi C. Huttner W.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 265-274PubMed Google Scholar). Incubating the cells at 20°C accumulates secretory products in the TGN (34Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Cell. 1984; 38: 535-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 35Griffiths G. Pfeiffer S. Simons K. Matlin K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and thus permits the study of post-translational modifications at the exit of the Golgi apparatus (7Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20838-20844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhou A. Mains R.E.

The combination of the sulfate labeling with the BFA and 20°C transport blocks allowed an accurate study of the steps of transport of SgII in the TGN. Our results indicate that the cleavage of SgII may occur in the TGN in a compartment distal from the sulfation site but before the packaging of SgII in the secretory granules. GH3B6 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 15% horse serum (PAA Labor) and 2.5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C in 5% CO2. For experiments, they were grown in 35-mm dishes for 6 days in the presence of 180 nM insulin (Sigma), 10 nM epidermal growth factor (Becton Dickinson Labware), and 1 nM 17β-estradiol (Sigma). Before metabolic labeling, cells were incubated in sulfate-free Ham's F-12 medium for 30 min. They were then pulse-labeled for 5 or 10 min at 37°C in the presence of 200-250 μCi/dish carrier free [35S]sulfate (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Cells were washed three times with Ham's F-12 on ice before further chase. The 20°C incubations were performed by transferring the cells from ice to a 19-20°C water bath. BFA (Epicentre Technologies) was always used at 10 μg/ml. When added after a 20°C incubation, BFA was always added at 20°C, 3-5 min before the temperature shift to a 37°C water bath. Chloroquine (Sigma) was always used at 40 μM. In some experiments, the release of SgII was stimulated with either 30 nM TRH (Calbiochem) or 30 mM KCl. All the experiments were performed with duplicate culture dishes and reproduced three times. Cells were scraped on ice in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.3% Tween 20 containing 200 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μM leupeptin, and 1 μM pepstatin. Lysates were boiled for 3 min, cooled on ice, and centrifuged 10 min at 23,000 × g Supernatants were collected and acetone precipitated overnight at −20°C. Media were collected and centrifuged to pellet any detached cell before trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the proteins overnight at 4°C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on acrylamide gradients (5-20%) mini-gels (Hoeffer). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 either before direct autoradiography or treatment for fluorography with Amplify (Amersham Corp.). Gels were exposed to either Bio-Max films (Kodak) or β-Max films (Amersham Corp.). Quantitation of autoradiograms was performed by densitometric analysis with Agfa Arcus Plus and NIH Image. To investigate the intracellular site of sulfation, we pulse-labeled GH3B6 cells with [35S]sulfate for 5 min in both the presence and the absence of 10 μg/ml BFA. In control cells, [35S]sulfate was incorporated in heparan sulfate proteoglycans, chromogranin B, and SgII (see Fig. 2A). Sulfation was completely abolished after a 30-min pretreatment of the cells with BFA (see Fig. 2A). Longer pretreatment of 120 min provided the same results (not shown). If BFA was added at the beginning of the pulse without pretreatment, sulfation was strongly inhibited and could not be increased by extending the pulse up to 15 min in the presence of the drug (see Fig. 2A). We also investigated the effect of BFA on the cleavage of sulfated SgII by adding the drug immediately post-pulse. In control cells, sulfated SgII is sequentially cleaved from the C terminus to the N terminus (Fig. 1). The cleavage products are accumulated in the cells as 27- and 21-kDa fragments (Fig. 2B) (19Muller L. Tougard C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). BFA completely prevented this proteolytic processing. It also inhibited the secretion of sulfated SgII (not shown), as already described in PC12 cells (32Miller S.G. Carnell L. Moore H.P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 33Rosa P. Barr F.A. Stinchcombe J.C. Binacchi C. Huttner W.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 265-274PubMed Google Scholar). BFA blocks anterograde transport by inhibiting the association of the ADP-ribosylation factor and the coat proteins with the membranes of the organelles involved in the secretory process (38Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 39Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The coat proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus (β-COP) and the TGN (γ-adaptin) are dispersed in the cytoplasm within 1 min in the presence of BFA (40Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwarz J. Bloom G.S. Kreis T.E. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 41Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of the rapidity of the dispersion to study the kinetics of the inhibition of SgII proteolytic processing by BFA. Chase media were replaced by BFA containing media either 10, 20, or 30 min after a 5-min pulse (Fig. 3). Whereas BFA completely inhibited the processing of SgII when added immediately post-pulse (Fig. 3, lane 5), it had no effect 20 min or more after the pulse (Fig. 3, lane 7 and 8). If BFA was added 10 min after the pulse (Fig. 3, lane 6), two pools of sulfated SgII were present in the cell extracts: one was BFA-sensitive and not cleaved, the other was BFA-resistant and cleaved. 10 min after the pulse, the processing of SgII had not begun (Fig. 3, lane 1), and the fragments of SgII present when BFA was added at 10 min chase time were thus generated in the presence of the drug. It is worth noting that this cleaved SgII was not accumulated as 80- or 40-kDa intermediate fragments but rather as 27- and 21-kDa terminal fragments. This demonstrated that BFA inhibited the cleavage of SgII through a block of transport from the sulfation site to the cleavage compartment and not through the inhibition of the proteolytic activity itself. The transport step inhibited by BFA could correspond to the formation of secretory granules as evidenced by several groups (32Miller S.G. Carnell L. Moore H.P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 33Rosa P. Barr F.A. Stinchcombe J.C. Binacchi C. Huttner W.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 265-274PubMed Google Scholar) or could occur within the TGN itself. In order to distinguish between these two possibilities, we studied the release of the proteolytic products generated in the presence of BFA by stimulating the cells with 30 nM TRH. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]sulfate for 5 min and chased in control medium for 5 min before the addition of BFA for 55 min. This provided the same pattern of cleavage as on Fig. 3 (lane 6): one pool of BFA-sensitive uncleaved SgII and another of BFA-resistant SgII, which was present as 27- and 21-kDa fragments. Cells were then stimulated with TRH for 30 min (Fig. 4). This secretagogue released the SgII maturation products from control cells. BFA did not inhibit this release if it was present only during the second chase with TRH. When cells were incubated in the presence of BFA during both chases, the maturation products that had been generated in the presence of BFA could not be released by TRH (Fig. 4). Experiments performed with 30 mM KCl provided the same results (not shown). Some SgII fragments could therefore be generated in the presence of BFA but not released. Incubating cells at 20°C accumulates proteins in the TGN and blocks the formation of secretory vesicles (34Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Cell. 1984; 38: 535-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 35Griffiths G. Pfeiffer S. Simons K. Matlin K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). SgII was sulfated in GH3B6 cells incubated at 20°C (not shown). When the cells were pulse-labeled at 37°C and chased at 20°C, SgII could be processed to the same peptides, but the kinetics of the cleavage was dramatically slowed down: the first fragments appeared between 30 and 60 min (Fig. 5). In order to determine if this inhibition resulted from the transport block or from the inhibition of the proteolytic activity, we took advantage of the results obtained with BFA, i.e. the absence of effect of the transport block on the cleavage of SgII 20 min after the pulse. Cells were first chased at 37°C for 30 min in order to allow transport of SgII to the cleavage compartment. They were then incubated at 20°C for 30 min (Fig. 5). The cleavage pattern observed at the end of this second chase was similar to that observed after the first 30 min chase at 37°C. This demonstrated that SgII was not further processed during the second chase at 20°C. The inhibition of proteolytic processing at 20°C was thus caused by the inhibition of the proteolytic activity rather than by the transport block alone. This could possibly be related to the inhibition of PC2 at 20°C already evidenced in vitro (42Xu H. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22875-22881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of BFA after an incubation at 20°C. Cells were thus chased at 20°C for 30 min, after a 5-min pulse with [35S]sulfate and prior to a 60-min incubation at 37°C in the presence of BFA. This protocol provided the same proteolytic pattern of SgII as that already observed when BFA was added 10 min after the pulse: one pool of sulfated SgII was BFA-sensitive and uncleaved, whereas the other was BFA-resistant and accumulated as 27- and 21-kDa fragments (Fig. 6A). We also investigated the release of the fragments generated in the presence of BFA by stimulating the cells with 30 nM TRH (Fig. 6B). TRH could release the fragments generated under control conditions, even if it was added together with BFA. The fragments generated in the presence of BFA could, however, not be released upon stimulation of the cells. The same results were obtained after stimulation of secretion with 30 mM KCl (not shown). These experiments demonstrate that the transport block induced by BFA, which results in the inhibition of the cleavage of SgII, was upstream from the 20°C accumulation site, unlike the other block, which results in the inhibition of the release of the fragments of SgII. The acidification of luminal pH in the TGN and the secretory granules is necessary for the proteolytic processing of some peptide precursors and pro-hormones (reviewed in Refs. 1Halban P.A. Irminger J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar and 43Anderson R.G.W. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We investigated the involvement of the acidification of luminal pH in the processing of SgII with 40 μM chloroquine, a lysosomotropic agent that blocks intra-organelle acidification. Chloroquine had no effect on the sulfation of SgII, but it completely inhibited the proteolytic processing of sulfated SgII (Fig. 7A). We also investigated the secretion of sulfated SgII in the presence of chloroquine. Uncleaved sulfated SgII could be released in the medium, and this release could be stimulated by TRH (Fig. 7B). This indicates that the inhibition of SgII cleavage induced by chloroquine was not due to the derouting of SgII from its regulated secretory pathway. In this study we investigated the proteolytic processing of endogenous SgII in GH3B6 prolactin cells. Recent biochemical studies have provided evidences for the cleavage of precursors in the TGN as well as in the secretory granules (7Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20838-20844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhou A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using BFA and 20°C incubations, we were able to demonstrate that sulfated SgII is cleaved in the TGN of GH3B6 cells. Sulfation is a post-translational modification specific to the TGN (20Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Spiro R.C. Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Garcia J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sulfated SgII has been used as a marker for the transport between the TGN and the plasma membrane in PC12 cells (23Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Cell. 1990; 60: 837-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 24Miller S.G. Moore H.P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Grimes M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Unlike GH3B6 cells, this cell line does not process SgII to smaller peptides. Sulfated SgII in GH3B6 cells therefore provides a unique model for studying in detail the proteolytic processing in the TGN. Our experiments indeed permitted to evidence two BFA-sensitive steps in the delivery of SgII from its sulfation site in the TGN to the secretory granules: sulfated SgII is first transported to a distal compartment of the TGN where its cleavage is initiated and then packaged in the secretory granules. Biochemical studies and subcellular fractionation have demonstrated that sulfation is a post-translational modification specific to the TGN (20Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Cell. 1990; 60: 837-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). BFA has also been used to demonstrate that sulfation occurred in the TGN of epithelial (21Spiro R.C. Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Garcia J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and neuroendocrine cells (22Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rosa P. Barr F.A. Stinchcombe J.C. Binacchi C. Huttner W.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 265-274PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments are in agreement with these studies: pretreatment of the cells with BFA completely abolished sulfation, and treatment at the beginning of the pulse also strongly inhibited sulfation. These results are relevant of the absence of redistribution of the sulfotransferase to the rough endoplasmic reticulum together with the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi (reviewed in Ref. 31Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). In such a hypothesis, the inhibition of sulfation observed results from the lack of delivery of substrate to the TGN, as already proposed by others (21Spiro R.C. Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Garcia J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), even though we cannot exclude that the sulfotransferase activity itself is inhibited by the BFA treatment. We used BFA to study the site of the initiation of the proteolytic processing of SgII. BFA completely abolished the cleavage of SgII in GH3B6 cells when it was added immediately post-pulse. This demonstrates that the cleavage compartment of SgII is different from the sulfation compartment. This observation is in agreement with the lack of direct sulfation of any SgII proteolytic fragment that we have already described (19Muller L. Tougard C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When BFA was added a few minutes after the pulse, the fragments of 27 and 21 kDa were, however, generated. This demonstrates that the cleavage of SgII may occur in the presence of BFA and that BFA blocks the delivery of sulfated SgII to the cleavage site without inhibiting the proteolytic activity itself. Two lines of evidence indicate that this transport block occurs before the formation of the secretory granules. First, incubating the cells at 20°C as briefly as 30 min permitted the cleavage of sulfated SgII in the presence of BFA. Second, the 27- and 21-kDa sulfated fragments generated in the presence of BFA could not be released in the medium when the cells were stimulated by 30 nM TRH or 30 mM KCl, even though BFA had no effect on the release of the stored granules. This indicates that the SgII fragments generated in the presence of BFA were not present in secretory granules, not even in immature secretory granules, which have the same exocytotic potency as the mature granules (44Arvan P. Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Zavacki A.-M. Elahi D. Wang S. Pilkey D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14171-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Tooze S.A. Flatmark T. Tooze J. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1491-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to results obtained in β-cells in which BFA inhibited the cleavage of proinsulin accumulated in the TGN at 20°C (8Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20838-20844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference could be relevant of the cell types. Indeed, immunocytochemical studies have also demonstrated that the cleavage of proinsulin occurred only in the secretory granules of β-cells (2Orci L. Ravazzola M. Storch M.J. Anderson R.W.G. Vassali J.D. Perrelet A. Cell. 1987; 49: 865-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), whereas that of pro-opiomelanocortin took place in the TGN of pituitary corticotropes (4Schnabel E. Mains R.E. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The use of sulfate labeling in the TGN together with the BFA and 20°C transport blocks has therefore permitted demonstration of the cleavage of endogenous SgII in the TGN and definition of the two steps in the transport of SgII from its sulfation site to the secretory granules (Fig. 8). The first step occurs in the TGN itself and corresponds to the delivery of sulfated SgII to the cleavage site, which is a distal compartment of the TGN. The second step corresponds to the packaging of SgII in the secretory granules. The distinction between these two steps was only possible under conditions that accumulate the proteins at the exit of the TGN, i.e. in the presence of BFA or at 20°C. The cleavage of SgII in the TGN may therefore result from an increase in the residence time of SgII in this organelle. Such a hypothesis is in agreement with the increased sialylation of chromogranin B in the TGN of PC12 cells in the presence of BFA (33Rosa P. Barr F.A. Stinchcombe J.C. Binacchi C. Huttner W.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 265-274PubMed Google Scholar). Our results do not exclude that under normal conditions of transport, SgII is mainly cleaved in secretory granules, as suggested by the stimulation of the secretion of uncleaved SgII (19Muller L. Tougard C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). They demonstrate that the conditions necessary for the cleavage of SgII are present in the TGN. The cleavage site that we have defined as a distal compartment of the TGN could possibly correspond to the dilated zones of the TGN where regulated secretory products aggregate in neuroendocrine cells. The acidification of luminal pH in the TGN to 6-6.5 triggers the aggregation of SgII (46Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and prolactin (47Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Such a pH was also necessary for the cleavage of prosomatostatin in infected GH3 cells (42Xu H. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22875-22881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our own experiments with chloroquine demonstrate that the pH acidification is also necessary for the cleavage of SgII. The acidification of pH may thus be responsible for both the aggregation and the cleavage of SgII in the TGN. Ultrastructural studies have evidenced the aggregation of proteins in specific regions of the more distal part of the TGN in endocrine cells (48Farquhar M.G. Palade G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 77-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including prolactin cells (49Tougard C. Picart R. Tixier-Vidal A. Am. J.

The TGN is a very dynamic structure whose size and shape vary greatly according to the cell type and activity (51Griffiths G. Fuller S.D. Back R. Hollinshead M. Pfeiffer S. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 277-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 52Rambourg A. Clermont Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar). Three-dimensional morphological studies of prolactin cells lead to the hypothesis that secretory granules were formed concomittantly with the network and that this process itself consumed the membrane by fragmentation of the network (50Rambourg A. Clermont Y. Chrétien M. Olivier L. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The same was described concerning the formation of secretory vesicles in NRK cells (53Ladinsky M.S. Kremer J.R. Furcinitti P.S. McIntosh J.R. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Such a dynamic model could well be conciliated with our results (Fig. 8). The first step of transport of sulfated SgII in the TGN might correspond to the formation of the network concomittantly with the combination of the factors necessary for the cleavage. The second step might correspond to the fragmentation of the network during the formation of the secretory granules. We gratefully acknowledge Eric Etienne for the photographic work.

In order to understand the regulation of its expression, the mouse 90K gene was isolated and analyzed. The gene spans about 8.8-kilobase pairs and consists of 6 exons and was localized on chromosome 11, region E. RNase protection identified one major transcription start site (+1) and three minor ones (-3, +32, +34). The mouse 90K gene was found to have a TATA-less promoter of unusual structure. The 2. 3-kilobase pair 5'-flanking region exhibited strong promoter activity in NIH 3T3 cells; however, it contained neither a TATA-box nor a SP1 site and was not GC-rich. No known initiator motif was found around the transcription start site. 5'- and 3'-deletions defined a minimal promoter of 51 base pairs (-66 --> -16), not including the start site, essential and sufficient for promoter activity. This minimal promoter showed increased activity after stimulation with interferon-gamma or poly(I.C), a substance mimicking viral infection. Essential for both inductions was the integrity of an interferon regulatory factor element within this sequence, a potential binding site for the anti-oncogenic transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1."

We and others have previously shown that the SP family of mammalian transcription factors regulates the transcription of a number of genes whose activities are governed by the product of the retinoblastoma (Rb) susceptibility gene, including c-FOS, c-MYC, TGFβ-1, IGF-II, and c-JUN To determine whether a similar pathway of transcriptional regulation may function in yeast, we explored the possibility that transcription factors with nucleotide-binding specificities akin to those of the SP family are expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Here we report the detection of novel yeast proteins (S. cerevisiae, p180; S. pombe, p200) that specifically bind Rb-regulated promoter elements in vitro dependent on nucleotides that are also required for binding and trans-activation by SP family members in vivo Our results indicate that the S. cerevisiae retinoblastoma control element-binding activity 1) requires zinc for association with DNA; 2) does not bind to SCB, MCB, or E2F sites in vitro; 3) is cell cycle-regulated in a SWI6-independent fashion; and 4) maximally stimulates retinoblastoma control element-mediated transcription in early- to mid-S phase.

The Rb protein is believed to control cell proliferation at least in part via the transcriptional regulation of a wide variety of growth-related genes. Although capable of associating with DNA in a sequence-nonspecific fashion, Rb regulates transcription indirectly via its physical or functional interaction with trans-acting factors that specifically bind to DNA (3Horowitz J.M. Udvadia A.J. Mol. Cell. Diff. 1995; 3: 275-314Google Scholar).

At least three ubiquitously expressed nuclear proteins (retinoblastoma control proteins, RCPs), including SP1 and SP3, bind to RCEs in vitro, and the interaction of one or more of these proteins with RCEs in vivo is required for RCE-mediated transcription (7Kim S.-J.

A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Co-expression of Rb and SP1 or SP3 in transient transfection assays leads to a marked stimulation of RCE transcription, a phenomenon we have termed “superactivation” (10Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D.R. Murata Y. Martin K.H. Humphrey P.A. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J.

Regions of Rb that are targets of mutation in human tumors are required for Rb-mediated superactivation, suggesting that the functional interaction of Rb with SP1/SP3 plays a significant role in the regulation of cell cycle progression (11Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which Rb stimulates SP-mediated transcription has yet to be clearly defined. Physical interactions between Rb and members of the SP family of transcription factors have not as yet been detected in vitro or in vivo perhaps suggesting that Rb interacts with these transcription factors in the context of a large macromolecular complex. Consistent with this supposition, Rb has been proposed to modulate the transcriptional activity of SP family members via their liberation from negative regulators or by indirectly “bridging” their trans-activation domains to components of the basal transcription machinery (8Chen L.I.

Trans-activation mediated by transcription factors such as ATF-2, NF-IL6, MYOD, and myogenin is also stimulated and/or facilitated by Rb in vivo (14Kim S.-J. Wagner S. Liu F.

Unlike SP family members, Rb forms physical complexes with these latter factors although the mechanism by which Rb augments their transcriptional activity has not as yet been determined. In contrast to these functional effects, interactions of Rb with transcription factors such as E2F, ELF-1, and UBF lead to the suppression of transcriptional activity (18Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 19Wang C.-Y. Petryniak B. Thompson C.B. Kaelin W.G.J. Leiden J.M.

Nature. 1995; 374: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Rb forms cell cycle-regulated complexes with factors such as E2F and ELF-1 in vivo, sequestering their trans-activation domains from components of the basal transcription complex (18Nevins J.R.

Hence, Rb is believed to control the transcription of at least some cell cycle-regulated genes via periodic interactions with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. The Rb protein is phosphorylated in concert with the progression of the mammalian cell cycle. Quiescent cells, post-mitotic cells, and cells in early G1 carry un- or underphosphorylated Rb protein (22Buchkovich K. Duffy L.A. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 58: 1097-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 23Chen P.-L. Scully P. Shew J.-Y. Wang J.Y.J. Lee W.-H.

Science. 1989; 246: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In cycling cells, Rb becomes increasingly phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues beginning in late G1 (the “restriction point”) and extending through G2 and then is abruptly de-phosphorylated in anaphase (26Ludlow J.W. Glendening C.L. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Rb is a substrate of a number of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), including cyclin D/CDK4 and cyclin E/CDK2 (27Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel cell cycle-regulated Rb and histone H1 kinase has recently been described that associates with the Rb amino terminus in G2/M phases (28Sterner J.M. Murata Y. Kim H.G. Kennett S.B. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9281-9288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Sterner J.M. Tao Y. Kennett S.B. Kim H.G. Horowitz J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar). Given that the initiation of DNA synthesis occurs subsequent to Rb phosphorylation, it is widely suspected that phosphorylation of Rb is a necessary step for normal cells to transit through the G1/S boundary. This view is consistent with the observations that 1) transcription factors that control gene expression at the G1/S boundary, such as E2F, are bound exclusively by un- or underphosphorylated Rb; and 2) phosphorylation of Rb by cdks in vitro inactivates Rb as an inhibitor of E2F-mediated transcription (18Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 21Chellappan S.P. Mol. Cell. Diff. 1994; 2: 201-220Google Scholar, 30Dynlacht B.D. Flores O. Lees J.A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1772-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The recent identification of homologues of E2F and Rb in Drosophila and suggestions of an Rb-like protein in plants serves to support the contention that a conserved pathway of transcriptional regulation may operate in many, if not all, eukaryotic cells (31Dynlacht B.D.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1206-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To date, a structural homologue of Rb has not been identified in yeast, but proteins that are similar to mammalian targets of Rb function have been noted. For example, a 47-kDa factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that specifically binds E2F sites in a cell cycle-dependent fashion has been reported, and a similar factor has been detected in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (36Vemu S. Reichel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20724-20729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 37Malhorta P. Manohar C.F. Swaminathan S. Toyama R. Dhar R. Reichel R. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20392-20401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In concert with these findings, when expressed in S. cerevisiae Rb is phosphorylated by yeast cdks at sites that are targets of phosphorylation in mammalian cells (38Hatakeyama M. Brill J.A. Fink G.R. Weinberg R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rb phosphorylation in yeast appears to be temporally controlled in a manner that is similar to that which occurs in mammalian cells; Rb is phosphorylated prior to the initiation of DNA synthesis in yeast coincident with the cell cycle checkpoint termed “Start” (27Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). Given these observations, it is tempting to speculate that yeast may harbor proteins functionally analogous to Rb that integrate progression of the cell cycle with transcriptional regulation. Yet, exogenous expression of human Rb in yeast does not appreciably alter cell cycle progression, suggesting that should yeast carry Rb-like proteins their targets of function may not be closely related to their mammalian counterparts (37Malhorta P. Manohar C.F. Swaminathan S. Toyama R. Dhar R. Reichel R. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20392-20401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, cell cycle-regulated transcription of a number of critical genes has been shown to be at least partly dependent on two heterodimeric transcription factors, SBF and MBF, and their interaction with SCB (SWI4-SWI6 cell cycle box) and MCB (MluI cell cycle box) promoter elements, respectively (39Koch C. Moll T. Neuberg M. Ahorn H. Nasmyth K. Science. 1993; 261: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 40Andrews B. Mason S.W. Science. 1993; 261: 1543-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). SCB promoter elements (5′-CACGAAA-3′) govern the periodic transcription of genes such as the HO endonuclease and cyclins (CLN1 and CLN2). MCB elements (5′-ACGCGTNA-3′) direct the transcription of a variety of genes including many required at the G1/S boundary for entry into S phase, such as thymidylate synthase (TMP1) and B-type cyclins (CLB5 and CLB6). SBF is composed of the SWI4 and SWI6 proteins, whereas active MBF complexes result from the heterodimerization of MBP1 and SWI6 proteins. Transcription factors that are structurally and functionally similar to SWI4, SWI6, and MBP1 have also been isolated from S. pombe (40Andrews B. Mason S.W. Science. 1993; 261: 1543-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Given that RCEs share limited sequence homology (5′-GCGCCACC-3′) with yeast SCB and MCB elements, we hypothesized that RCEs might represent a related family of cell cycle-regulated yeast promoter elements. Furthermore, we speculated that yeast RCE-binding proteins might be functionally, and perhaps structurally, homologous with mammalian RCPs. In this report we characterize the biochemical and functional properties of a novel cell cycle-regulated RCE-binding protein, p180, that is synthesized in S. cerevisiae and whose DNA-binding domain is functionally homologous to that of SP1, SP3, and perhaps other members of the SP family of mammalian transcription factors. Table I lists the yeast strains used in this study. Cells were grown in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) at 30°C or in selective SDmin media for strains transformed with URA3-based plasmids. For cell cycle studies, temperature-sensitive cdc mutants were grown in YEPD at 23°C to an A600 nm of 0.4, pelleted, resuspended in prewarmed YEPD, and incubated at 37°C for 5 h. Arrest was confirmed by documenting terminal arrest phenotypes under light microscopy. Cdc17 cells arrest heterogeneously at S phase (38°C) or G2 (34°C) and were treated at 38°C in this study (41Burke D.J. Church D. Mol. Cell.

A synthetic oligonucleotide and its complement carrying three tandem copies of an octameric p180-binding site (pNUT; 5′-TCGAGCGCCACCGCGCCACCGCGCCACC-3′) or a mutated derivative and its complement lacking a p180-binding site (pWEE; 5′-TCGAGCTTCACCGCTTCACCGCTTCACC-3′) were cloned upstream of the CYC1 promoter at a unique XhoI site. Plasmids containing one or two copies of pNUT or one to three copies of pWEE upstream of LACZ were identified by double-stranded DNA sequencing (43Zhang H. Scholl R. Browse J. Somerville C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and named pNUT1, pNUT2, pWEE1, pWEE2, and pWEE3, respectively. To further differentiate between independent clones that were examined for β-galactosidase activity, a lowercase letter was appended to each plasmid name (e.g. pNUT2b is a second clone with two copies of a wild-type trimer). Cell transformations and β-galactosidase assays were performed using previously described protocols (44Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold SPring Harbor Course Manual.Cold SPring Harbor Laboratory. 1989; Google Scholar). To quantify p180-mediated transcription as a function of cell cycle progression, a mutated derivative of the CLN2 gene (Cln2x/s; a kind gift of David Stuart, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) encoding a nonfunctional protein was cloned downstream of a p180-dependent promoter by linking together a 1.5-kb DNA fragment containing the pNUT2b promoter, a 1.5-kb DNA fragment of pUC19CLN2x/s, 2D. Stuart, unpublished data. and plasmid pRS306, a single copy URA3-containing vector (45Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid dependent on a promoter lacking a p180-binding site, pWEE3a, was prepared in a similar manner. The resulting plasmids, pNUT2bCLN2x/s and pWEE3aCln2x/s, carry the defective CLN2 gene in the same transcriptional orientation as URA3 High copy plasmids carrying these CLN2 reporter genes were prepared by transferring pNUT- or pWEE-dependent genes to plasmid pRS202, a URA3-containing vector, 3P. Hieter, personal communication. producing plasmids P5Cln202 and W1Cln202, respectively. Yeast extracts were prepared by bead-beating 1 × 109 cells for 30 min at 4°C following their suspension in 1.0 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 90 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A and leupeptin (Sigma). This suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred to tubes containing an equal volume of 0.5 M HEPES (pH 7.4), 30 mM KCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin; protein concentrations were determined by a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad), and aliquots were stored at −80°C. Radiolabeled probes were prepared and employed in protein-DNA binding assays as described previously (9Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Horowitz J.M.

Oligonucleotides used as radiolabeled probes or competitor DNAs are listed in Table II. Radiolabeled probes had a specific activity of 105 cpm/ng DNA, and 1-2 × 105 cpm of probe was typically combined with 5 μg of yeast proteins. Competition experiments with unlabeled oligonucleotides typically employed a 50-200-fold molar excess of DNA relative to radiolabeled probes. Following resolution on polyacrylamide gels and transfer to paper, protein-DNA binding assays were exposed to film (Kodak XAR-5) for 2 days at −80°C or directly analyzed in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).Table IIWildtype and mutated oligonucleotidesNameSequenceReferenceFos5′-CCCGCCCTCTGGTG-3′9Udvadia A.J.

Primer extension was carried out using a synthetic primer (5′-CGAGCTCGCCC-3′), bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR, Sigma), dTTP, dATP, radiolabeled dGTP and dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA), and Klenow enzyme (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) as described elsewhere (9Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Horowitz J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 597-608PubMed Google Scholar). A BUdR-substituted probe (12 × 106 cpm) with a specific activity of 109 cpm/ng was employed in a protein-DNA binding assay with 35 μg of yeast proteins. Following resolution on a polyacrylamide gel, protein-DNA complexes were irradiated by UV light in situ and visualized by exposure of the gel to film, and excised complexes were applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, dried gels were exposed to film for 2 days at −80°C. Apparent molecular weights of resulting protein-DNA complexes were determined by comparison with molecular weight markers resolved in parallel. Yeast cultures were grown in YEPD to approximately A600 nm = 0.5 at 30°C, and α factor pheromone (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. After 2.5 h of incubation, cell cycle arrest was confirmed by microscopic examination. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 3 ml of sterile deionized water, sonicated, and added to fresh, prewarmed YEPD media. Subsequently, 50 ml of cells were collected by centrifugation at 15-min intervals for the preparation of protein extracts or RNA. Small aliquots of cells were also fixed in 4 volumes of 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.15 M NaCl to establish a budding index by microscopic inspection. Fresh, prewarmed YEPD was added every 45 min during synchronous growth to maintain a stable concentration of cells. Cultures of cells containing high copy reporter plasmids were grown in YEPD because synchrony was not optimal in selective minimal media. No more than 7% of cells (as determined by replica plating onto YEPD and selective minimal media plates) lost their respective plasmids during synchronous growth in YEPD. RNA extracts were obtained using a modification of a previously described procedure (47Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in a sodium acetate buffer and treated with 1% SDS. Phenol equilibrated in sodium acetate buffer was added to disrupted cells and incubated at 70°C for 4 min with periodic agitation. The mixture was cooled rapidly for 10-15 s in an ethanol/dry ice bath and subsequently clarified by centrifugation. The aqueous phase was re-extracted with phenol and finally with chloroform, and RNA was precipitated and resuspended in distilled H2O. Following quantification by UV spectroscopy, 10 μg of RNA was resolved in a 1.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel as described previously (48Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1989; : 7.43-7.45Google Scholar) and then transferred to BioTrans+ filters (ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Irvine, CA). Blots were baked, prehybridized, and hybridized with 2 × 106 cpm/ml (specific activity of 0.8-1.0 × 109 cpm/μg DNA) of radiolabeled probe. Radiolabeled probes used for these studies were prepared from a 1.5-kb BamHI fragment of pUC19Cln2x/s, a BamHI-BglII fragment of pSKACT1 (ACT1 probe), and a HindIII fragment of pMS202 (copy II of the yeast histone H4 gene; Ref. 49Smith M.M. Andresson O.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 663-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Probes were prepared using a random primer kit following instructions of the manufacturer (Promega, Inc., Madison, W"
