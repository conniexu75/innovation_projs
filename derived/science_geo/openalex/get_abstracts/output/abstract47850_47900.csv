https://openalex.org/W2010526455,A new conceptual framework and a minimization principle together provide an understanding of computation in model neural circuits. The circuits consist of nonlinear graded-response model neurons organized into networks with effectively symmetric synaptic connections. The neurons represent an approximation to biological neurons in which a simplified set of important computational properties is retained. Complex circuits solving problems similar to those essential in biology can be analyzed and understood without the need to follow the circuit dynamics in detail. Implementation of the model with electronic devices will provide a class of electronic circuits of novel form and function.
https://openalex.org/W1986992784,"Cachectin (tumor necrosis factor) is a macrophage hormone strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of endotoxin-induced shock. The availability of a DNA probe complementary to the cachectin messenger RNA (mRNA), as well as a specific antibody capable of recognizing the cachectin gene product, has made it possible to analyze the regulation of cachectin gene expression under a variety of conditions. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages obtained from mice contain a pool of cachectin mRNA that is not expressed as protein. When the cells are stimulated with endotoxin, large quantity of additional cachectin mRNA is produced, and immunoreactive cachectin is secreted. Macrophages from mice of the C3H/HeJ strain do not produce cachectin in response to endotoxin. A dual defect appears to prevent cachectin expression. First, a diminished quantity of cachectin mRNA is expressed in response to low concentrations of endotoxin. Second, a post-transcriptional defect prevents the production of cachectin protein. Macrophages from endotoxin-sensitive mice do not produce cachectin if they are first treated with dexamethasone, apparently for similar reasons. These findings give new insight into the nature of the C3H/HeJ mutation and suggest an important mechanism by which glucocorticoids may act to suppress inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2054800842,"A new family of protein kinase C-related genes has been identified in bovine, human, and rat genomes. The alpha-, beta-, and gamma-type protein kinase sequences are highly homologous, include a kinase domain, and potential calcium-binding sites, and they contain interspersed variable regions. The corresponding genes are located on distinct human chromosomes; the possibility of even greater genetic complexity of this gene family is suggested by Northern and Southern hybridization analyses."

https://openalex.org/W1989526931,The hemagglutinin of influenza virus is synthesized as a monomeric subunit that is cotranslationally translocated across the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. We show that folding and assembly of hemagglutinin monomers into trimeric structures takes approximately 7-10 min and is completed before the protein leaves the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutants of hemagglutinin that fail to be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum are blocked at different stages of the folding pathway. Unfolded molecules of hemagglutinin are associated with a cellular protein of 77 kd that has been shown previously to bind to IgG heavy chain in the endoplasmic reticulum of certain myelomas. We discuss why assembly of native structures is required for transport of proteins through the exocytotic pathway.
https://openalex.org/W2009856702,"Protein kinase C, the major phorbol ester receptor, was purified from bovine brain and through the use of oligonucleotide probes based on partial amino acid sequence, complementary DNA clones were derived from bovine brain complementary DNA libraries. Thus, the complete amino acid sequence of bovine protein kinase C was determined, revealing a domain structure. At the amino terminal is a cysteine-rich domain with an internal duplication; a putative calcium-binding domain follows, and there is at the carboxyl terminal a domain that shows substantial homology, but not identity, to sequences of other protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2024588724,"Indirect evidence suggests that the 5' end of U1 snRNA recognizes the 5' splice site in mRNA precursors by complementary base pairing. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether point mutations in the alternative 12S and 13S 5' splice sites of the adenovirus E1A gene can be suppressed by compensatory base changes in human U1 snRNA. When the mutant E1A and U1 genes are contransfected into HeLa cells, we observe efficient suppression of one mutation at position +5 in the 12S splice site, but exceedingly weak suppression of another mutation at position +3 in the 13S splice site. These and other results suggest that base pairing between U1 and the 5' splice site is necessary but not sufficient for the splicing of mRNA precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2077993951,"We isolated and sequenced 6.3 kb of cDNA encoding that rat glucocorticoid receptor, a protein that binds and activates a class of hormone-dependent transcriptional enhancers. Receptor-containing cells produce receptor mRNAs of approximately equal to 6.5 kb and approximately equal to 4.8 kb that differ only in their 3' nontranslated regions; an open reading frame of 795 amino acids resides within the 5' portion of the transcripts. The coding region was expressed in vitro, in transient transfections, and in stable transfectants of a receptor-deficient cell line. The protein products are indistinguishable from bona fide receptor with respect to sedimentation and electrophoretic mobility, antibody reactivity, and hormone and DNA binding. Moreover, the cloned receptor protein activates its corresponding enhancers, restoring to the receptor-deficient cells the full capacity for regulated enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W2082364885,"Direct evidence on age patterns of infecundity and sterility cannot be obtained from contemporary populations because such large fractions of couples use contraception or have been sterilized. Instead, historical data are exploited to yield upper bounds applicable to contemporary populations on the proportions sterile at each age. Examination of recent changes in sexual behavior that may increase infecundity indicates that sexually transmitted infections, the prime candidate for hypothesized rises in infertility, are unlikely to have added to infecundity to any great extent. These results imply that a woman in a monogamous union faces only moderate increases in the probability of becoming sterile (or infecund) until her late thirties. Nevertheless, it appears that recent changes in reproductive behavior were guaranteed to result in the perception that infecundity is on the rise."
https://openalex.org/W2088233139,"Continuous measurement and imaging of the intracellular free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) of mitotic and interphase PtK1 cells was accomplished with the new fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2. No statistically significant difference between basal [Ca2+]i of interphase and mitotic cells was detected. However, mitotic cells showed a rapid elevation of [Ca2+]i from basal levels of 130 nM to 500 to 800 nM at the metaphase-anaphase transition. The [Ca2+]i transient was brief, lasting approximately 20 seconds and the elevated [Ca2+]i appeared uniformly distributed over the entire spindle and central region of the cell. The close temporal association of the [Ca2+]i transient with the onset of anaphase suggests that calcium may have a signaling role in this event."

https://openalex.org/W2057892928,"Platelets initially adhere to collagen via a divalent cation-dependent process supported by Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, or Co2+ more rapidly and to a greater extent than by previously studied divalent cation-independent mechanisms. Ca2+ not only fails to support adhesion, it is inhibitory. Platelet activation and secretion are not required for adhesion by this mechanism. Monomeric and fibrillar collagens, but not denatured collagen, effectively support divalent cation-dependent adhesion. Types I, III, and IV collagen, but not type V collagen, support adhesion. A platelet surface protein of Mr 160,000, possibly identical with platelet membrane glycoprotein la, that binds to collagen with the appropriate divalent cation specificity has been identified and is the likely mediator of the initial divalent cation-dependent adhesion of platelets to collagen."
https://openalex.org/W2087662072,"An esterase gene from the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus that is responsible for resistance to a variety of organophosphorus (OP) insecticides was cloned in Î»gt11 phage. This gene was used to investigate the genetic mechanism of the high production of the esterase B1 it encodes in OP-resistant Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Tem-R strain) from California. Adults of the Tem-R strain were found to possess at least 250 times more copies of the gene than adults of a susceptible strain (S-Lab). The finding that selection by pesticides may result in the amplification of genes encoding detoxifying enzymes in whole, normally developed, reproducing insects emphasizes the biological importance of this mechanism and opens new areas of investigation in pesticide resistance management."
https://openalex.org/W1966551225,"The complete primary structure (1827 amino acids) of rabbit intestinal pro-sucrase-isomaltase (pro-SI) was deduced from the sequence of a nearly full-length cDNA. Pro-SI is anchored in the membrane by a single 20 amino acid segment spanning the bilayer only once. The amino-terminal, cytoplasmic domain consists of 12 amino acids and is not preceded by a cleaved leader sequence. This suggests a dual role for the membrane-spanning segment as an uncleaved signal for membrane insertion. This is followed by a 22 residue serine/threonine-rich, probably glycosylated, stretch, presumably forming the stalk on which the globular, catalytic domains are directed into the intestinal lumen. Following this is a high degree of homology between the isomaltase and sucrase portions (41% amino acid identity), indicating that pro-SI evolved by partial gene duplication."

https://openalex.org/W135343356,"We have identified a cDNA whose sequence is preferentially expressed when quiescent fibroblasts are stimulated to proliferate. The steady-state levels of the mRNA corresponding to this clone, called 2A9, are increased by serum, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor, but not by insulin or platelet-poor plasma. mRNA levels of 2A9 are also increased in human acute myeloid leukemia. The 2A9 cDNA has been molecularly cloned from an Okayama-Berg library, and its complete nucleotide sequence has been determined. It has an open reading frame of 270 nucleotides, which has a 55% homology with the coding sequence of the beta-subunit of the S-100 protein, a calcium-binding protein that belongs (like calmodulin and the vitamin D-dependent intestinal calcium-binding protein) to the family of calcium-modulated proteins and is found in abundance in several human tumors, including melanoma. The S-100 protein and the deduced aminoacid sequence of 2A9 are also partially homologous to the small subunit of a protein complex that serves as a cellular substrate to tyrosine kinase. The partial homology of 2A9 (whose RNA is inducible by growth factors and is overexpressed in human acute myeloid leukemias) to the S-100 protein, other calcium-modulated proteins, and the subunit of a substrate for tyrosine kinase, is particularly interesting in view of the role attributed to calcium and tyrosine kinases in the regulation of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1980712067,"The pair-rule genes of Drosophila are required for the subdivision of the developing embryo into a repeating series of homologous body segments. One of the pair-rule genes, even-skipped (eve), appears to be particularly important for the overall segmentation pattern since eve- embryos lack all segmental subdivisions in the middle body region. On the basis of homeo box cross-homology we have isolated a gene, S72, which probably corresponds to eve. In embryo tissue sections S72 transcripts show a periodic distribution pattern. The eve- phenotype appears to involve altered patterns of fushi tarazu and engrailed expression. These and other findings suggest that pair-rule gene expression might involve hierarchical cross-regulatory interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1586315850,"A group of 35,000-dalton sialoglycoproteins is the major non-serum protein component of pulmonary surfactant. Tryptic fragments of these proteins were sequenced, and oligonucleotide probes were synthesized based on the amino acid sequences. A human lung cDNA library was then screened using the oligonucleotide probes, and clones coding for these proteins were identified and characterized. By in vitro transcription-translation experiments we have associated individual clones with particular proteins. The data suggest that co-translational modifications of two primary translation products account for many of the isoforms observed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in the precursors of 35,000-dalton sialoglycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1589296898,"Two low molecular weight pea seed albumins (Mr approximately 6000 and approximately 4000) have been characterized by protein, cDNA, and gene sequencing. Both proteins are encoded by separate regions of the same mRNA species. The initial translation product is a preproprotein from which a signal sequence is removed co-translationally. The resultant proprotein (PA1) is then cleaved post-translationally to yield the mature form of the two albumins (PA1a and PA1b). Comparison of cDNA and protein sequences suggests that at least four different PA1 genes are expressed in the pea genome. Both PA1a and PA1b have an unusually high cysteine content (7.5 and 16.2%, respectively). Pea seeds developing under suboptimal levels of sulfur nutrient supply contain reduced levels of PA1 mRNA and accumulate greatly reduced levels of PA1a and PA1b in the mature seed. In vitro transcription studies showed that this reduced level of PA1 mRNA resulted from reduced post-transcriptional stability rather than an altered rate of transcription of the PA1 gene. In contrast, during normal seed development, the level of PA1 mRNA seems to be under transcriptional control. Sequence comparisons reveal some homology between PA1 and a number of low molecular weight proteins from seeds of a wide range of mono- and dicotyledonous plants."
https://openalex.org/W2019669549,"We describe an in vitro transcription system in which the polyadenylated 3â² ends of vaccinia virus mRNAs are formed by termination downstream of a regulatory signal. When linear DNA templates containing vaccinia early genes were incubated with soluble enzymes extracted from vaccinia virions, mature-size mRNAs were synthesized within 1 min, whereas longer run-off transcripts were not detected until later. Deleting a series of thymidylate residues located downstream of the coding region abolished termination. The 3â² ends of the transcripts formed heterogeneously, between 50 and 70 nucleotides past the T-rich termination signal, in either viral- or vector-derived sequences. Poly-adenylation of the transcripts occurred without regard to the terminal sequence and was inhibited by adding exogenous RNA. Although exogenous RNAs were also polyadenylated, processing of 3â² ends was not observed."
https://openalex.org/W1533844361,"The activation of bovine prothrombin by prothrombinase (Factor Xa, Factor Va, synthetic phospholipid vesicles, and calcium ion) was studied in the presence of the fluorescent, reversible thrombin inhibitor dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl) amide (DAPA). Recordings of fluorescence intensity during prothrombin activation exhibited maxima that decreased to stable limiting values. These data suggested the transient appearance of the meizothrombin-DAPA complex, which exhibits fluorescence with 1.5-fold greater intensity than the thrombin-DAPA complex. At substrate concentrations well below Km, progress curves could be fitted by equations describing an ordered, sequential conversion of prothrombin to thrombin through the intermediate meizothrombin via two pseudo-first order steps. The pseudo-first order rate constants for both steps varied linearly with enzyme concentration, indicating that both steps are catalyzed by prothrombinase. The progress of the reaction was also monitored by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and densitometry analyses of aliquots removed at intervals spanning the reaction. These analyses confirmed both the existence of meizothrombin and its time course as predicted from the equations used to analyze fluorescence intensity profiles. Meizothrombin levels peaked at about 0.3 mol/mol initial prothrombin under the conditions typically studied. In addition, prethrombin 2, which is the intermediate expected from cleavages occurring in the order opposite that required to form meizothrombin, was not observed under any of the conditions examined. These data indicate that prothrombin activation catalyzed by the fully assembled prothrombinase complex proceeds via an ordered, sequential reaction with meizothrombin as the sole intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1508442047,"By a combination of protein chemistry and recombinant DNA methods a glycine-rich region was found to be located near the carboxyl terminus of the nucleolar specific phosphoprotein, nucleolin, from Novikoff hepatoma (protein C23) and Chinese hamster ovary cells (100-kDa nucleolar protein). A sequence of 192 amino acid residues was derived from partial sequences of cyanogen bromide and N-bromosuccinimide fragments of protein C23 and deduced protein sequence from Chinese hamster ovary cell 100-kDa cDNA sequences. The 66 residues sequenced by protein methods were identical to the corresponding residues deduced by DNA sequencing. The multiple residues of NG,NG-dimethylarginine (DMA) contained in the nucleolin polypeptide were found to be limited to a segment of less than 10 kDa near the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. This segment also contained internally repeated sequences (e.g. 7 copies of the sequence Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Gly were found) which were unrelated to sequences closer to the amino-terminal end. Most arginine residues in this region were surrounded by 2 or 3 glycine residues and were relatively close in sequence to phenylalanine residues."
https://openalex.org/W2008386019,"Tay-Sachs disease patients of Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish French Canadian origin are affected with a clinically identical form of this inherited disease. Both have a similar gene frequency for the disorder, which is tenfold higher than that found in the general population. Unlike other patients with the disease, who often display variation at the clinical or biochemical level, the absence of such differences between these two groups has prompted the idea that they may harbor the same mutation. In this report, a complementary DNA clone coding for the alpha chain of human beta-hexosaminidase has been used to analyze the genetic lesions in the alpha-chain locus of two patients with Tay-Sachs disease from each of these groups. On the basis of DNA hybridization analyses, the alpha-chain gene of the Ashkenazi patients appears intact while the alpha-chain gene of French Canadian patients has a 5' deletion of approximately 5 to 8 kilobases."
https://openalex.org/W1487565172,"The equilibrium properties of the NADP+ binding site of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR, or Fd-NADP+ reductase) were examined with regard to specificity in binding, and with regard to the oxidation-reduction properties of the FNR.NADP+ complex. With the exception of 3'-NADP+, only adenosine nucleotides with a 2'-adenosyl phosphate bound to Fd-NADP+ reductase. Kd values increased in the order: 2',5'-ADP greater than 2',5'-ATP ribose greater than NADP+ greater than 2'-AMP greater than 3'-NADP+. No evidence was found for binding of NAD, NMN, or 5'-ADP. Thus the 2'-adenosylphosphate controls specificity in substrate binding, as well as specificity in enzyme activity. The low affinity of Fd-NADP+ reductase for 2'-AMP suggests that the phosphate(s) of the pyrophosphate bridge of NADP+ may also contribute significantly to binding energy. Fd-NADP+ reductase was found to form a high-affinity two-electron reduced complex (FNR.NADPH) with a NADPH; complex formation was associated with appearance of long-wavelength charge-transfer bands. Kd of FNR.NADPH complex was about 6% the Kd of oxidized FNR.NADP+ complex. As predicted by the lower Kd, the Em for reduction of FNR.NADP+ complex to the charge-transfer complex was about 40 mV more positive than the potential of the NADP+/NADPH couple. Rapid kinetic studies supported description of the charge-transfer complex as primarily oxidized FNR.NADPH. Thus, complex formation helps drive electron transfer from the flavoprotein to NADP+."
https://openalex.org/W1520211983,"The mid- to late-term rat placenta produces several moderately abundant proteins in a specific temporal manner, one of which we have identified as rat placental lactogen II (rPLII) (Duckworth, M. L., Kirk, K. L., and Friesen, H. G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10871-10878). In this paper, we describe the isolation and characterization of cDNA clones of another of these proteins, called rat prolactin-like protein A (rPLP-A) because of its homology with the prolactins. The single mRNA transcript corresponding to rPLP-A is 1 kilo-base in length and first appears at Day 14 of pregnancy, 2 days later than rPLII mRNA, and then increases and remains at high levels until term. The mRNA hybridizing to rPLP-A cDNA clones translates in vitro to a protein of 25,000 daltons which is processed by dog pancreatic microsomes to 27,000 daltons. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the rPLP-A clones suggests that rPLP-A is a secreted protein of 196 amino acids with two potential glycosylation signals. The sequence is more than 40% homologous at the amino acid level to rat and human prolactins and rPLII. This study provides clear evidence for the existence of considerable amounts of undescribed prolactin-like proteins in late term rat placenta."
https://openalex.org/W1575913198,"The activation of human neutrophils by chemotactic peptides evokes a rapid change in membrane potential and an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels. These events are followed up to a minute later by detectable levels of microbicidal agents formed by the oxidative burst. Except for the latter, the sequence of events has remained unclear. We report here that a new fluorescent Ca2+ indicator developed by R. Tsien, Indo-1, has allowed us to resolve the temporal relationship between the rapid and transient cytoplasmic Ca2+ rise and the membrane potential change and to do so on very small samples by using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. We have adapted a FACS 440 for simultaneous single cell membrane depolarization and cytoplasmic [Ca2+] detection in human neutrophils upon stimulation with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). A membrane potential probe, dipentyloxacarbocyanine, allows us to determine that the membrane potential change is fMLP dose-dependent and apparently biphasic. The depolarization is maximal 40 s after stimulation. In contrast, cytosolic [Ca2+], while fMLP-dose dependent, is maximal at 10 s and already decreasing rapidly when the cell has reached its lowest potential. It can be measured with Indo-1 which has a fluorescence emission (lambda ex = 357 nm) maximum at 485 nm when Ca2+-free and 405 nm when Ca2+-liganded. The ratio of these fluorescences may then be calibrated in terms of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels. Thus, Ca2+ release into the cytoplasm becomes the earliest evidence of neutrophil stimulation by fMLP and occurs in close association with an apparent membrane hyperpolarization."
https://openalex.org/W1582323028,"We have examined the exchange of recA protein between stable complexes formed with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and (a) other complexes and (b) a pool of free recA protein. We have also examined the relationship of ATP hydrolysis to these exchange reactions. Exchange was observed between two different recA X ssDNA complexes in the presence of ATP. Complete equilibration between two sets of complexes occurred with a t1/2 of 3-7 min under a set of conditions previously found to be optimal for recA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange. Approximately 200 ATPs were hydrolyzed for every detected migration of a recA monomer from one complex to another. This exchange occurred primarily between adjacent complexes, however. Little or no exchange was observed between recA X ssDNA complexes and the free recA protein pool, even after several hundred molecules of ATP had been hydrolyzed for every recA monomer present. ATP hydrolysis is not coupled to complete dissociation or association of recA protein from or with recA X ssDNA complexes under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1635973539,"Activated protein C has been derivatized with the active site-directed fluorophore 2-(dimethylamino)-6-naphthalenesulfonylglutamylglycylarginyl chloromethyl ketone (2,6-DEGR-APC). Covalently modified activated protein C has been used to investigate the binding interactions of the protein to factors V and Va in the presence of phospholipid vesicles. The fluorescence polarization of the 6-dimethylaminonaphthalene-2-sulfonyl moiety increased saturably with increasing phospholipid concentrations in the presence or absence of factor V or Va. Differences in the limiting polarization values indicated distinguishable differences in the interactions between 2,6-DEGR-APC and phospholipid in the presence of factor V or Va. The dissociation constant calculated for the 2,6-DEGR-APC/phospholipid interaction (7.3 X 10(-8) M) was not significantly altered by factor V but was decreased to 7 X 10(-9) M in the presence of factor Va. The interaction between 2,6-DEGR-APC and factor V or Va was characterized by a 1:1 stoichiometry. The binding of 2,6-DEGR-APC to factor V or Va in the presence of phospholipid could be reduced in a competitive manner by diisopropylphosphofluoridate-treated activated protein C. An analysis of the displacement curves indicated that the binding of 2,6-DEGR-APC was indistinguishable from the binding of diisopropylphosphofluoridate-treated activated protein C. The interaction between 2,6-DEGR-APC and phospholipid-bound factor Va was further examined using the isolated subunits of factor Va. Fluorescence polarization changes observed with component E of Va (light chain) closely corresponded with the changes observed with factor Va, whereas isolated component D (heavy chain) had little influence on the binding of 2,6-DEGR-APC to phospholipid vesicles. The data presented are consistent with the interpretation that component E of factor Va contains a binding site for activated protein C."

The infected cells rapidly produced both cellular and secreted Met-enkephalin immunoreactivity. Although each cell line could secrete intact proenkephalin, only a mouse pituitary line was capable of processing proenkephalin to mature enkephalin peptides. The quantity of intact proenkephalin secreted from BSC-40 cells (derived from African Green monkey kidney) was sufficient to establish the value of vaccinia virus as a mammalian cell expression vector."
https://openalex.org/W168063230,"Heparin cofactor II (HCII) inhibits thrombin rapidly in human plasma in the presence of heparin or dermatan sulfate. To determine the minimum structure of dermatan sulfate required to activate HCII, the glycosaminoglycan was partially degraded by sequential treatment with periodate, [3H]borohydride, and sulfuric acid. Labeled oligosaccharide fragments were separated by gel filtration chromatography. Purified fragments were then applied to a column of HCII bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose, and bound oligosaccharides were eluted with a gradient of sodium chloride. Di-, tetra-, and hexasaccharide fragments did not bind to HCII, while 15% of the octasaccharides and up to 45% of larger fragments bound. Octasaccharides that bound to the HCII column had a greater negative charge than the run-through material based on anion-exchange chromatography, suggesting that they contained a greater number of sulfate groups per molecule. Fragments of dermatan sulfate containing a minimum of 12-14 sugar residues accelerated inhibition of thrombin by HCII. Fragments of this length that bound to the column of immobilized HCII had molar specific activities greater than those of the fragments that did not bind. These studies suggest that HCII is activated by dermatan sulfate fragments greater than or equal to 12 residues in length that contain a specific octasaccharide sequence required for binding to the inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2063062586,"The Xenopus hsp70 gene is transiently heat-inducible in somatic cells; in injected oocytes, it is efficiently expressed without heat shock. I show here that this cell-type-specific and gene-specific activation is dependent on the presence of a heat shock regulatory element (HSE) and a CCAAT box in the hsp70 promoter; neither element by itself is sufficient for full activation. The same promoter elements are also required for heat inducibility in somatic cells. I propose that CAAT-binding transcription factor (CTF) interacts with heat shock transcription factor (HSTF), thereby enhancing the affinity of HSTF for the promoter; cell-type specificity could be explained by assuming either oocyte-specific forms or oocyte-specific high levels of CTF and/or HSTF."
https://openalex.org/W1525892012,"S-protein, the inhibitor in plasma of the membrane attack complex of complement, appears to have a second function in coagulation. S-protein during clotting enters into a trimolecular complex with thrombin and antithrombin III (ATIII). Functionally, S-protein in the presence of low concentrations of heparin, protects thrombin from inactivation by ATIII. Complex formation between S-protein and thrombin, and between S-protein, thrombin, and ATIII, was demonstrated by agarose gel electrophoresis and by two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis of purified proteins and in recalcified, clotted plasma. Formation of the trimolecular S-thrombin-ATIII complex was strictly dependent on the presence of thrombin. No association was detectable between S-protein and ATIII or between S-protein and prothrombin. Heparin was not required for the formation of the bimolecular S-protein-thrombin complex or the trimolecular S-protein-ATIII complex. The protective effect of S-protein on inactivation of thrombin by ATIII was demonstrated in functional assays with purified proteins and in plasma only in the presence of low concentrations of heparin. Thus, S-protein may mediate its effect by scavenging heparin required for ATIII activation. It is suggested that the protection of thrombin by S-protein from inactivation by ATIII may be of physiological importance."

The method is applied to the reconstruction at a resolution of 2.2 nanometers of the neck of bacteriophage Ï29, obtained from transmission electron micrographs processed by the direct Fourier method. The combined use of directed illumination, reflectance models, color, and different levels of transparency provides a powerful tool for a better interpretation of the three-dimensional structure, allowing improved correlation with genetic, structural, and biochemical data."
https://openalex.org/W2120119770,"The expression of previously dormant human muscle genes encoding two major components of the contractile apparatus was activated in multinucleated heterokaryons formed by the fusion of mouse muscle cells and human fibroblasts. The accumulation of human and mouse alpha-cardiac and alpha-skeletal actin transcripts was compared by Northern blot, slot blot, and S1 nuclease assays. The pattern of human transcript accumulation in heterokaryons was quite distinct from that in the mouse muscle cells that induced it, and strikingly similar in time course and relative amounts to that in human primary muscle cultures. In addition, the usual decline in the level of mouse alpha-cardiac actin transcripts was not observed; instead, after fusion with human fibroblasts the levels increased. Our findings suggest that the activated human nuclei in heterokaryons produce their own muscle regulatory factors that alter the expression of mouse muscle genes and direct the expression of the human muscle phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1500470286,"We have isolated from a BALB/c genomic library a 17.5-kilobase (kb) DNA fragment containing the entire mouse sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glycerol-P dehydrogenase) gene, and a substantial portion of the flanking regions. The DNA sequence of 10.8 kb of this fragment was determined. Using this information, together with the DNA sequence of several partial glycerol-P dehydrogenase cDNA clones and the rabbit glycerol-P dehydrogenase amino acid sequence, we determined the structural organization of the mouse glycerol-P dehydrogenase gene. The gene is 7.3 kb long and contains 8 exons. Transcription starts 19 base pairs 5' of the ATG initiation codon. Sequence analysis and S1 nuclease mapping indicated that the 8th exon contains coding sequences for the last 31 amino acids of glycerol-P-dehydrogenase, followed by 1.7 kb of 3' untranslated mRNA sequence. The mouse glycerol-P dehydrogenase amino acid sequence determined from the DNA sequence is 90% homologous with the rabbit enzyme. An examination of the exon/intron organization of the mouse glycerol-P dehydrogenase gene shows that intron 3 precisely separates the NAD-binding and the catalytic domains and intron 2 separates the adenine- and nicotinamide-binding regions."
https://openalex.org/W1586712563,"Antibodies elicited against chromosomal protein HMG-17, purified from calf, were used to screen a human lambda gt11 cDNA expression library and isolate the full length cDNA coding for this protein. Sequence analysis reveals that the nucleotide distribution along this cDNA is highly asymmetric. The amino acid sequence, deduced from the reading frame, reveals that the human HMG-17 is, respectively, 96 and 92% homologous with the calf and chicken protein. The amino acid substitution are conservative suggesting evolutionary constraints on the conformation of the protein. The human genome contains 35-50 HMG-17 gene copies which, as revealed by Southern analysis, are distributed at several loci. Northern analysis of total RNA isolated from 3 human cell lines, indicates that each cell contains a single-size mRNA coding for this protein. Nucleotide sequences which cross-hybridize, under stringent conditions, with the human HMG-17 cDNA are present in the genome of rodents and absent from the genomes of sea urchin, Drosophila, and yeast. The availability of a probe for the HMG-17 gene may help elucidate the cellular role of this protein which may confer specific conformations to transcribable regions in the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1597229455,"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase commits tetrahydrofolate-bound one carbon units to use in the regeneration of the methyl group of adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in eucaryotes and its activity is allosterically inhibited by AdoMet. Limited proteolysis and scanning transmission electron microscopy have been employed to show that the enzyme is a dimer of identical subunits and that each subunit is composed of spatially distinct domains with molecular masses of approximately 40 and 37 kDa (Matthews, R. G., Vanoni, M. A., Hainfeld, J. F., and Wall, J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11647-11650). We now report the use of the photoaffinity label 8-azido-S-adenosylmethionine (8-N3AdoMet) to locate the binding site for the allosteric inhibitor on the 37-kDa domain. In the absence of light, 8-N3AdoMet is itself an inhibitor of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase activity, with a Ki value 4.8-fold higher than AdoMet, and like AdoMet it induces slow transitions between active and inactive forms. Photoaffinity labeling is dependent on irradiation with ultraviolet light and is prevented by AdoMet but not by ATP. Limited proteolysis of the photolabeled enzyme results in the formation of a labeled 37-kDa fragment which is further processed to a labeled 34-kDa fragment. On conversion of the 34-kDa fragment to a 31-kDa polypeptide, all label is lost, suggesting that the labeling is restricted to an approximately 3-kDa region near one end of the 37-kDa polypeptide. Limited proteolysis of the native enzyme, while completely desensitizing the enzyme to inhibition by AdoMet or 8-N3AdoMet, does not prevent subsequent photolabeling of the 37-kDa peptide fragment. This photolabeling does not occur in the presence of excess AdoMet. These latter experiments suggest that the desensitization of the enzyme eliminates the ability of allosteric effectors to stabilize an inactive form of the enzyme, but does not abolish specific binding of 8-N3AdoMet or AdoMet."
https://openalex.org/W1525893964,"Human glycophorin A belongs to a family of structurally related cell surface glycoproteins which are expressed in erythroid cells. We have recently isolated several human glycophorin A-specific cDNA clones and have determined their nucleotide sequence (Siebert, P. D., and Fukuda, M. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 1665-1669). In this report by using cDNA and exact sequence synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides as hybridization probes, we provide evidence that human glycophorin A and B are encoded by separate and distinct genes present as single copies in the human genome. Furthermore, we show that the expression of the glycophorin A and B genes are coordinately regulated by tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate."
https://openalex.org/W131679324,"The principal products derived from in vivo processing of anglerfish preproglucagon II were isolated and their structures determined. The structures were confirmed by a combination of automated Edman degradation, amino acid analysis, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The peptide corresponding to anglerfish preproglucagon II-(22-49) (numbering from the amino terminus of preproglucagon) was isolated intact and defines the site of signal cleavage to be between Gln-21 and Met-22. Glucagon from the anglerfish preproglucagon gene II was found to correspond to preproglucagon II-(52-80) (numbering from the amino terminus). Three forms of a glucagon-like peptide derived from preproglucagon II were also isolated. The structure of the longest form was consistent with the sequence of preproglucagon II-(89-122) deduced from the cDNA, His-Ala-Asp-Gly-Thr-Tyr-Thr-Ser-Asp-Val-Ser-Ser-Tyr-Leu-Gln-Asp-Gln-Ala- Ala-Lys-Asp-Phe-Val-Ser-Trp-Leu-Lys-Ala-Gly-Arg-Gly-Arg-Arg-Glu. The carboxyl-terminal portion deduced from the cDNA remains intact in this form. A second form, preproglucagon II-(89-119) appears to result from proteolytic processing of the major form at the two adjacent arginine residues occurring at the carboxyl terminus. This second form has a glycine residue at its carboxyl terminus and is processed to the third form (preproglucagon II-(89-118)) which contains a carboxyl-terminal arginineamide. Radiolabeling studies in primary tissue culture support the observation that glucagon (preproglucagon II-(52-80], preproglucagon II-(89-122), and preproglucagon II-(89-119) are products of proglucagon processing in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4434835,"Filaggrin is the histidine-rich basic protein that aggregates keratin filaments in fully differentiated cells of the epidermis. Filaggrin is synthesized in the granular cell layer as a high molecular weight precursor protein (profilaggrin) that consists of multiple repeated copies of filaggrin. cDNA clones for rat and mouse epidermal profilaggrin have been constructed from sucrose gradient-enriched RNA in order to study the repetitive structure of profilaggrin. These clones hybridize to high molecular weight epidermal mRNA (23 kilobase pairs, rat and 19 kilobase pairs, mouse) and exhibit limited cross-hybridization between species. Several rat clones direct the synthesis of a portion of rat profilaggrin in bacteria. One of these, rat profilaggrin cDNA clone R4D6, is 2400 base pairs in length. The R4D6 cDNA is shown to contain repetitive sequence by restriction mapping and southern hybridization analysis of restriction digests of this plasmid, using subfragments of the plasmid as hybridization probes. Southern hybridization analysis of rat genomic DNA, digested to completion with several restriction enzymes, reveals a simple hybridization pattern of fragments equal in size to those of the cDNA. Partial digestion of rat genomic DNA results in a ladder of bands based on a 1200-base pair repeat, equal to the size of the repeating unit of the cDNA clone, and consistent with the expected repeating size of profilaggrin. Together, these results show that the profilaggrin mRNA and gene have repetitive structure and that the gene apparently lacks introns in the coding region."
https://openalex.org/W1528306046,"Abstract We have examined the effects of the transcriptional inhibitor alpha-amanitin and the translational inhibitor cycloheximide on levels of calbindin-D28K (28-kDa calcium binding protein, CaBP) and CaBP-mRNA in the vitamin D-replete chick intestine. Chicks were raised on one of four diets: normal (1% calcium, 0.6% phosphorus); high calcium (3.3% calcium, 0.5% phosphorus); low calcium (0.3% calcium, 0.6% phosphorus); or low phosphorus (1% calcium, 0.09% phosphorus). Chicks were then treated either with alpha-amanitin (20 micrograms/chick) or cycloheximide (600 micrograms/chick) 2 h prior to a dose of 6.5 nmol of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Duodenal mucosa was collected from 0 to 120 min afterward and assayed for CaBP-mRNA by dot blot hybridization and for CaBP using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the absence of inhibitor, CaBP levels were depressed by high calcium and elevated by low calcium or low phosphorus, as expected. These changes occurred, however, without a change in CaBP-mRNA levels. alpha-Amanitin had no effect on CaBP or on CaBP-mRNA levels in chicks raised on any of the diets. Cycloheximide inhibited CaBP levels, and surprisingly also inhibited CaBP-mRNA levels in all four dietary groups. These results indicate that continual protein synthesis is necessary for the expression of CaBP-mRNA, suggesting the existence of a rapidly turned over protein that may be required for stabilization or for processing of the chick intestinal CaBP messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1514904832,"In contrast to the rapid response of mRNA-S14 which occurs within 20 min after L-triiodothyronine (T3) administration, the induction of other rat hepatic mRNA sequences exhibits a lag time of several hours. We have studied the induction of mRNA-S11 which codes for a protein of pI 6.1 and an Mr of 22,500 as a model of such a slowly responsive gene. In addition to T3, both glucocorticoids and growth hormone regulate the expression of this gene. For each of these stimuli, the response exhibits a lag time of approximately 6 h. Following this lag time, there is a linear increase in the level of mRNA-S11 induced by a single maximal dose of T3, dexamethasone, and growth hormone to levels of 15-, 6-, and 3-fold, respectively, in excess of the hypothyroid base-line levels. The similarity in the lag time and the differences in maximal responses effectively argues against the possibility that the effect of one hormone is mediated exclusively by a change in the secretion or metabolism of another. Support for a direct action of T3 and glucocorticoids on the hepatic cell comes from the observation that these hormones stimulate mRNA-S11 in rat hepatocytes under primary culture. The increases in in vitro nuclear transcription measured following T3 and dexamethasone administration were clearly insufficient to account for the observed increases in mRNA. Furthermore, the hormonal induction of mRNA-S11 was promptly abrogated by cycloheximide (10 mg/kg) injected 6 h after the administration of T3 or dexamethasone at the time of the expected mRNA increase. The post-transcriptional control of the mRNA-S11 and its sensitivity to cycloheximide are similar to previously documented responses of the rapidly induced mRNA-S14 and suggest for both sequences a requirement for ongoing synthesis of rapidly turning over proteins. We speculate that the lag time of response of a given gene to T3 or glucocorticoid may be an intrinsic characteristic of the gene and may represent a common set of molecular events involved in the activation of that gene by diverse stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1597929041,"The present studies were performed to further characterize a mouse yolk sac protein which is similar or identical to the vitamin D-dependent intestinal calcium-binding protein (CaBP). Yolk sac protein and purified rat intestinal CaBP displayed full identity upon immunodiffusion (Ouchterlony) using antiserum to the rat intestinal CaBP. Immunoreactive CaBP in yolk sac homogenates eluted from gel permeation columns with the low molecular weight peak of 45Ca2+ binding (Chelex assay), and the electrophoretic mobility of the protein was markedly increased by EDTA. On days 11-13 of gestation, the concentrations of immunoreactive CaBP in yolk sac were 4-5-fold higher than in placenta; by days 16-17, the concentrations in yolk sac and placenta were similar. Incubation of yolk sac with [3H]leucine demonstrated synthesis of immunoprecipitable [3H]CaBP. A single band of 3H-labeled protein was seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitate. This protein co-migrated with radioactive placental CaBP with an apparent Mr of 10,050. Addition of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) to organ culture media with or without serum increased the amount and concentration of CaBP in yolk sac (p less than 0.001) at 48 h. CaBP synthesis in yolk sac appeared to be independent of calcitriol concentrations in the maternal circulation since injection of the hormone into the maternal compartment produced no change in yolk sac CaBP despite increases of maternal intestinal and renal CaBP. These studies demonstrate that yolk sac immunoreactive CaBP is synthesized in yolk sac and has an apparent molecular size and calcium-binding properties characteristic of mammalian vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding proteins. The in vitro response of yolk sac CaBP to calcitriol is the first evidence of a vitamin D effect on the fetal membranes and suggests one function for calcitriol receptors in these tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1590901851,"We have combined amino acid sequence data with x-ray diffraction results to determine differences in structure of wheat germ agglutinin isolectin 1 (WGA1) relative to the known structure of wheat germ agglutinin isolectin 2 (WGA2). Electron density difference maps computed at 2.2 A resolution with coefficients [2F(WGA1) - F(WGA2)] and [F(WGA1) - F(WGA2)] and based on refined model phases of the WGA2 structure have revealed that the largest differences in the two isolectin structures are localized in the B-domain of the molecule. Amino acid sequence studies of tryptic and thermolytic peptides of WGA1 confirm the strong homology between the two isolectins and suggest variability at only four sequence positions. Three of these are closely spaced in domain B. The two histidines in WGA2, His59 and His66, are substituted by Gln and Tyr, respectively, and Pro56, by Thr in WGA1. The fourth difference at position 93 in domain C was identified as a change from Ser (WGA2) to Ala (WGA1). With these substitutions WGA1 exhibits a slightly higher degree of internal homology than does WGA2. In addition, we have carried out fluorescence studies on tryptic peptide T-3 to confirm the presence of a second Trp residue in the wheat germ agglutinin molecule, recently predicted at position 41 during the course of high resolution crystal structure refinement of WGA2."
https://openalex.org/W1482260509,"The partition of cholesterol analogues between dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles was examined. Cholesterol, trans- and cis-22-dehydrocholesterols, and 24 alpha-ethyl,trans-22-dehydrocholesterol (stigmasterol) showed a preference from gel phase dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine over fluid phase egg phosphatidylcholine at 37 degrees C. Within this group, the sterol concentration in DPPC relative to that in egg PC ranged from about 1.5 to 2.0. Cholesterol analogues with a 24 alpha-methyl or ethyl substituent (campesterol and beta-sitosterol, respectively) and cholestanol (dihydrocholesterol) distributed about equally between the two types of phospholipid. Thus, in this study involving two kinds of phospholipid and a small number of cholesterol analogues, there was no simple correlation between the sterol structure and its partition behavior. The combined results from studies on sterol partition behavior and on sterol interaction with individual phospholipids (Rujanavech, C., Henderson, P.A., and Silbert, D.F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7204-7214) provide an adequate basis to explain the different patterns of membrane lipid adaptation which accompany growth of LM cells on various cholesterol analogues (Rujanavech, C., and Silbert, D.F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7196-7203)."
https://openalex.org/W1680277545,A genomic clone containing Drosophila sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sequences has been isolated using a mixture of synthetic tridecanucleotides as a hybridization probe. The clone as well as the synthetic probe mixture was found to hybridize to an abundant poly(A)+ RNA of 1700 bases. A partial DNA sequence obtained for a 40-amino acid region containing the oligonucleotide hybridization site was found to agree with the known Drosophila protein sequence data for this region of the protein. In situ hybridization of this clone to the polytene chromosomes of wild type flies and flies bearing chromosomal aberrations that delimit the Gpdh+ locus have allowed us to decisively place the gene in the distal region of 26A on the left arm of the second chromosome.
https://openalex.org/W1577931165,"The formaldehyde-morpholine method for the conversion of gamma-carboxyglutamyl (Gla) residues to gamma-methyleneglutamyl (gamma-MGlu) residues has been applied to the modification of bovine prothrombin fragment 1. In the absence of Tb3+ ions or at Tb3+ ion concentrations of 2 Km app and 25 Km app the action of 10,000-fold molar excess of formaldehyde and morpholine, pH 5.0, converts the 10 Gla residues of the protein into 10 gamma-MGlu residues. Modification of the protein using the same conditions but increasing the Tb3+ concentration to 100 Km app provided a homogeneous protein containing 3 gamma-MGlu and 7 Gla residues, bovine 3 gamma-MGlu-fragment 1. The modified protein binds the same number of Ca2+ ions (6-7) as bovine fragment 1. However, the positive cooperatively associated with Ca2+ binding is abolished and the overall affinity for Ca2+ ions is reduced. Fluorescence titrations of 3 gamma-MGlu-fragment 1 using either Ca2+ or Mg2+ ions indicate that the modified protein retains a fluorescence quenching behavior similar to that of the native protein. The modified protein does not bind to phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine vesicles in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Thus the metal ion-induced fluorescence transition exhibited by the bovine protein appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for phospholipid binding."
