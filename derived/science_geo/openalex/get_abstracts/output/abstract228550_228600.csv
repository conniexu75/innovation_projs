https://openalex.org/W2009967312,"Six members of the mammalian transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels respond to varied temperature thresholds. The natural compounds capsaicin and menthol activate noxious heat-sensitive TRPV1 and cold-sensitive TRPM8, respectively. The burning and cooling perception of capsaicin and menthol demonstrate that these ion channels mediate thermosensation. We show that, in addition to noxious cold, pungent natural compounds present in cinnamon oil, wintergreen oil, clove oil, mustard oil, and ginger all activate TRPA1 (ANKTM1). Bradykinin, an inflammatory peptide acting through its G protein-coupled receptor, also activates TRPA1. We further show that phospholipase C is an important signaling component for TRPA1 activation. Cinnamaldehyde, the most specific TRPA1 activator, excites a subset of sensory neurons highly enriched in cold-sensitive neurons and elicits nociceptive behavior in mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TRPA1 activation elicits a painful sensation and provide a potential molecular model for why noxious cold can paradoxically be perceived as burning pain."

We report the complete genome sequence of C. parvum , type II isolate. Genome analysis identifies extremely streamlined metabolic pathways and a reliance on the host for nutrients. In contrast to Plasmodium and Toxoplasma , the parasite lacks an apicoplast and its genome, and possesses a degenerate mitochondrion that has lost its genome. Several novel classes of cell-surface and secreted proteins with a potential role in host interactions and pathogenesis were also detected. Elucidation of the core metabolism, including enzymes with high similarities to bacterial and plant counterparts, opens new avenues for drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2113404473,"In the nervous system of vertebrates, myelination is essential for rapid and accurate impulse conduction. Myelin thickness depends on axon fiber size. We use mutant and transgenic mouse lines to show that axonal Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) signals information about axon size to Schwann cells. Reduced Nrg1 expression causes hypomyelination and reduced nerve conduction velocity. Neuronal overexpression of Nrg1 induces hypermyelination and demonstrates that Nrg1 type III is the responsible isoform. We suggest a model by which myelin-forming Schwann cells integrate axonal Nrg1 signals as a biochemical measure of axon size."
https://openalex.org/W2132164731,"Radial glial cells function during CNS development as neural progenitors, although their precise contribution to neurogenesis remains controversial. Recent work has argued that regional differences may exist regarding the neurogenic potential of radial glia. Here, we show that the vast majority of neurons in all brain regions derive from radial glia. Cre/loxP fate mapping and clonal analysis demonstrate that radial glia throughout the CNS serve as neuronal progenitors and that radial glia within different regions of the CNS pass through their neurogenic stage of development at distinct time points. Thus, radial glial populations within different CNS regions are not heterogeneous with regard to their potential to generate neurons versus glia."
https://openalex.org/W2099277573,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are prototypes for the pharmaceutically important family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Here we present atomic resolution structures of nicotine and carbamylcholine binding to AChBP, a water-soluble homolog of the ligand binding domain of nicotinic receptors and their family members, GABAA, GABAC, 5HT3 serotonin, and glycine receptors. Ligand binding is driven by enthalpy and is accompanied by conformational changes in the ligand binding site. Residues in the binding site contract around the ligand, with the largest movement in the C loop. As expected, the binding is characterized by substantial aromatic and hydrophobic contributions, but additionally there are close contacts between protein oxygens and positively charged groups in the ligands. The higher affinity of nicotine is due to a main chain hydrogen bond with the B loop and a closer packing of the aromatic groups. These structures will be useful tools for the development of new drugs involving nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2061350749,"Dopamine neurons play a key role in reward-related behaviors. Reward coding theories predict that dopamine neurons will be inhibited by or will not respond to aversive stimuli. Paradoxically, between 3 and 49% of presumed dopamine neurons are excited by aversive stimuli. We found that, in the ventral tegmental area of anesthetized rats, the population of presumed dopamine neurons that are excited by aversive stimuli is actually not dopaminergic. The identified dopamine neurons were inhibited by the aversive stimulus. These findings suggest that dopamine neurons are specifically excited by reward and that a population of nondopamine neurons is excited by aversive stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2135691292,"Heterosexual transmission accounts for the majority of human immunodeficiency virus–1 (HIV-1) infections worldwide, yet the viral properties that determine transmission fitness or outgrowth have not been elucidated. Here we show, for eight heterosexual transmission pairs, that recipient viruses were monophyletic, encoding compact, glycan-restricted envelope glycoproteins. These viruses were also uniquely sensitive to neutralization by antibody from the transmitting partner. Thus, the exposure of neutralizing epitopes, which are lost in chronic infection because of immune escape, appears to be favored in the newly infected host. This reveals characteristics of the envelope glycoprotein that influence HIV-1 transmission and may have implications for vaccine design."

https://openalex.org/W2130955385,"The mammalian cerebral cortex is characterized by complex patterns of anatomical and functional areas that differ markedly between species, but the molecular basis for this functional subdivision is largely unknown. Here, we show that mutations in GPR56 , which encodes an orphan G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) with a large extracellular domain, cause a human brain cortical malformation called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). BFPP is characterized by disorganized cortical lamination that is most severe in frontal cortex. Our data suggest that GPCR signaling plays an essential role in regional development of human cerebral cortex."

In this study, we detected misfolded and aggregated α-synuclein in a Triton X-100 insoluble fraction as well as a high molecular weight product by gel electrophoresis of temporal neocortex from DLB patients but not from controls. We also found similar Triton X-100 insoluble forms of α-synuclein in an α-synuclein transgenic mouse model and in an in vitro model of α-synuclein aggregation. Introducing the molecular chaperone Hsp70 into the in vivo model by breeding α-synuclein transgenic mice with Hsp70-overexpressing mice led to a significant reduction in both the high molecular weight and detergent-insoluble α-synuclein species. Concomitantly, we found that Hsp70 overexpression in vitro similarly reduced detergent-insoluble α-synuclein species and protected cells from α-synuclein-induced cellular toxicity. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the molecular chaperone Hsp70 can reduce the amount of misfolded, aggregated α-synuclein species in vivo and in vitro and protect it from α-synuclein-dependent toxicity.

For the most part, these α-synuclein aggregates are densely compact and can be immunostained for multiple additional components including ubiquitin, synphilin-1, and heat shock proteins (HSPs), which suggests that protein misfolding or degradation is altered in cells that develop LBs. Mouse models of α-synuclein aggregation exist that mimic the findings in human brains and show intracellular α-synuclein aggregates (15Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Song D. Shults C.W.

Although it is known that the conformation of α-synuclein in LBs is significantly different from that in the neuropil (22Sharma N. McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Irizarry M.C. Hyman B.T. Acta Neuropathol. 2001; 102: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it is unclear which conformation of α-synuclein contributes to inclusion formation. In addition to the formation of intracellular aggregates, α-synuclein is also cytotoxic. It has been postulated that α-synuclein oligomers found in Parkinson's disease tissue by Western blot analysis represent the toxic species (5Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). HSPs belong to the family of chaperone proteins and are important in both refolding misfolded proteins and directing proteins toward proteasomal degradation (23Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C.

In fact, several HSPs and co-chaperones are associated with LBs (26Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M.

Neurochem. 2002; 83: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and we previously reported that overexpression of Hsp70 and related molecules can prevent the formation of α-synuclein aggregates in vitro (31McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Shariff S. Hewett J. Sharma N. Ueda K. Breakefield X.O. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 32McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In this study, we establish biochemical assays to assess aggregated α-synuclein and investigate the influence of Hsp70 on these α-synuclein species. We demonstrate that Hsp70 reduces α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity via its refolding and degradation activities. Human and Mouse Tissue—α-Synuclein transgenic animals (line D) have been described previously (16Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Hsp70-overexpressing mice were a kind gift of W. H. Dillmann (University of California, San Diego, CA) (33Marber M.S. Mestril R. Chi S.H. Sayen M.R. Yellon D.M. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 1446-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Fresh-frozen brain tissues (temporal cortex) from 12 subjects (10 men and 2 women) with a pathological diagnosis of DLB and 8 subjects (4 men and 4 women) without a neurodegenerative disease that served as control were obtained from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, The Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease Research Center, and the Massachusetts General Hospital-Massachusetts Institutes of Technology Udall Center Brain Bank. The mean age of death for the DLB cases was 80.5 years (±6.4 S.D.) and 73 years (±12.1 S.D.) for controls. The mean post-mortem interval was 14.3 h (±9.9 S.D.) for DLB and 13.2 h (±1.6 S.D.) for control cases. Brain tissue was homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 175 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and sonicated for 10 s (total cell lysates). Plasmid Construction—The constructs for human wild type untagged α-synuclein and its C-terminal tagged version (93 amino acid long tag referred to as Syn-T) and synphilin-1 have been described previously (31McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Shariff S. Hewett J. Sharma N. Ueda K. Breakefield X.O. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 32McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tagged α-synuclein is a truncated α-synuclein-enhanced GFP fusion protein that has 93 amino acids of enhanced GFP fused to the C terminus of α-synuclein. This fusion protein is no longer fluorescent but has a propensity to aggregate when overexpressed in H4 cells. Co-transfection with synphilin 1 further enhances this aggregation (32McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and thus, co-transfection of Syn-T plus synphilin 1 functions as our α-synuclein inclusion model. cDNA-encoding genes were cloned into pcDNA3.1 or pSI (Promega, Madison, WI) expression vectors. Human Hsp70 cDNA was kindly provided by J.-C. Plumier (Massachusetts General Hospital) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human H4 neuroglioma cells (HTB-148, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. H4 cells were passaged 24 h prior to transfection and plated in four-well chamber slides for immunocytochemistry (Labtek, Nalgen-Nunc, Naperville, IL) or 100-mm cell culture dishes for analysis of cell lysates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Cells were transfected with equimolar ratios of plasmids using Superfect (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-transfection with an empty pcDNA3.1 vector was used as control. After 48 h, cells were washed with cold PBS, harvested by scraping in cold lysis buffer without detergents (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 175 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitor mixture), and sheared once through a 30.5-G needle followed by sonication for 10 s (total cell lysates). Detergent-solubility Fractionation and Gel Electrophoresis—Detergent solubility was performed by adding Triton X-100 to total cell lysates (final concentration 1%) and incubating for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was designated Triton X-100 soluble fraction, and the pellet was redissolved in 2% SDS-containing lysis buffer and sonicated for 10 s (Triton X-100 insoluble fraction). Additional washing of the Triton X-100 insoluble pellet was found to not alter the α-synuclein expression in this fraction (data not shown) and was omitted from the experiments. Protein concentration was determined using a Lowry protein assay. 20–40 μg of each cell lysate was loaded onto 4–20 or 10–20% Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen) for Western blot analysis. SDS-PAGE was performed with SDS containing running and sample loading buffer, whereas native-PAGE (not containing any detergent) was performed with native (SDS-free) running and sample loading buffer (Invitrogen). Protein was transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked in blocking buffer (Lycor, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h prior to the addition of primary antibody, anti-α-synuclein (Syn-1, 1:1000, BD Transduction Laboratories) or anti-ubiquitin (SPA200, 1:1000, Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), at room temperature for 1–2 h or overnight at 4 °C. Following three Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 washes, infrared fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies (IRDye 800 anti-rabbit or anti-mouse, Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, at 1:3000 or Alexa-680 anti-rabbit or anti-mouse, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR at 1:3000) were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and immunoblots were processed and quantified using the Odyssey infrared-imaging system (Lycor). Blots were also probed for actin (antiactin, AC40, Sigma), or proteins on the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (quantified using Odyssey infrared-imaging system as loading controls). A mock-untransfected cell lysate was included in all of the cell culture experiments to control for nonspecific and endogenous signal. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were plated into 4-well chamber slides (Nunc) and transfected as described above. 48 h later, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. After blocking in 1.5% normal goat serum containing Tris-buffered saline for 1 h, cells were incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C followed by washing with PBS and secondary antibody incubation for 1 h. As a control for antibody specificity, 1 μl of antibody solution was preabsorbed with 20 μg of recombinant protein (α-synuclein, Alpha-Diagnostics Inc., San Antonio, TX; Hsp70, Stressgen) in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C followed by 16 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 4 °C (15,000 rpm) for 15 min, the immune complex-free supernatant was diluted in blocking solution and applied to the cells for 2 h followed by washing with PBS and secondary antibody incubation for 1 h. After a final wash, slides were coverslipped with aqueous mounting solution (GVA, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and subjected to fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. Toxicity Assay—Toxicology was analyzed 24 h after transfection by measuring the release of adenylate kinase from damaged cells into the culture medium using the ToxiLight™ (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantification of Cells Containing Inclusions—The number of cells containing α-synuclein-immunopositive inclusions was assessed by immunocytochemistry using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope with a ×20 objective as follows. Cells were assessed by an observer blind to the transfection conditions (i.e. the co-transfected plasmid). Approximately 300–400 cells from two wells were assessed for each experiment. A total of four experiments were performed with each condition. A positively transfected cell was scored based on the presence of significant α-synuclein immunostaining compared with background (which in all cases was negligible). A transfected cell containing inclusions was scored based on the presence of a detectable aggregate of α-synuclein immunostaining. A cell was considered positive for inclusions independent of the size or number of inclusions. The percentage of cells containing inclusions compared with the total number of transfected cells was recorded. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis for comparison of groups was performed by ANOVA with Fisher's probability of least significant differences post hoc test for significance. Triton X-100 Insoluble Monomeric and High Molecular Weight Species (HMW) of α-Synuclein in DLB—The current understanding of the pathophysiology of α-synuclein is that α-synuclein can form oligomers that then further aggregate into protofibrils and fibrils and result in tightly packed α-synuclein in Lewy bodies. To assess this process in human brains, we performed biochemical assays using protein extracts from temporal neocortex of DLB cases and control brains. This brain area has only modest numbers of LBs and Lewy neurites in DLB (34Gomez-Tortosa E. Newell K. Irizarry M.C. Albert M. Growdon J.H. Hyman B.T. Neurology. 1999; 53: 1284-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detergent-solubility testing revealed a Triton X-100 insoluble fraction containing α-synuclein species that formed a HMW product with a molecular mass ranging from 60 to 250 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). In addition to HMW-aggregated α-synuclein, we also detected SDS-soluble α-synuclein species in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction that ran at its expected monomeric mass on SDS-PAGE (∼16 kDa) (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, quantification of these species from 12 DLB cases and 8 control brains on SDS-PAGE showed a significant increase in both the HMW and the monomeric Triton X-100 insoluble fraction of α-synuclein in DLB brain compared with control brain. The HMW species and the monomeric α-synuclein found in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction was ∼2.5- or ∼2.0-fold higher in DLB, respectively (Fig. 1C). Analysis of α-synuclein levels in total protein fractions on SDS-PAGE showed no significant difference in total (SDS-soluble) or Triton X-100 soluble monomeric α-synuclein between DLB and control brain (Fig. 1C). Thus, DLB differs from control brain because of the presence of increased α-synuclein in Triton X-100 insoluble fractions, rather than a change in the total amount of α-synuclein. Triton X-100 Insoluble and HMW α-Synuclein Species in α-Synuclein Transgenic Animals—We next asked whether similar α-synuclein species were present in a mouse model of α-synuclein pathology. As reported by Masliah et al. (16Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar), α-synuclein transgenic mice (line D) have a substantial number of α-synuclein inclusions in the cortex that resemble some of the features of LBs found in human brain (16Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). To determine whether different aggregation states of α-synuclein led to the same biochemical features we observed in human DLB cortex, we examined total cell lysates from the cortex of 6-month-old α-synuclein transgenic and non-transgenic animals. Cell lysates were subjected to native PAGE and immunoblotted for α-synuclein. Interestingly, the HMW α-synuclein species of molecular masses between 90 and 150 kDa were detected in α-synuclein transgenic animals to a greater extent than in control animals (Fig. 2A). We next examined whether α-synuclein in the transgenic animals also displayed abnormal detergent insolubility. Indeed, ∼2-fold more Triton X-100 insoluble α-synuclein species were present on SDS-PAGE in α-synuclein transgenic animals than in control animals (Fig. 2B). Under SDS-denaturing conditions, the Triton X-100 insoluble α-synuclein was resolved into only monomeric 16-kDa species, suggesting that aggregated α-synuclein species are not as tightly packed and detergent-resistant in transgenic animals as in DLB cases. Prevention of HMW and Triton X-100 Insoluble α-Synuclein Species by Hsp70 in Mice—Recent data in the fly model suggest that overexpression of the molecular chaperone Hsp70 protects against α-synuclein-induced neuronal degeneration (26Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 30Bonini N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16407-16411Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition, data from our laboratory demonstrate that overexpression of Hsp70 and related molecules can prevent α-synuclein aggregates from forming in vitro (31McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Shariff S. Hewett J. Sharma N. Ueda K. Breakefield X.O. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and that LBs immunostain robustly for heat shock proteins (26Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 31McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Shariff S. Hewett J. Sharma N. Ueda K. Breakefield X.O. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Here we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of Hsp70 can reduce abnormal Triton X-100 insoluble α-synuclein species observed in the α-synuclein transgenic mice. We bred α-synuclein transgenic mice with mice overexpressing rat Hsp70 (33Marber M.S. Mestril R. Chi S.H. Sayen M.R. Yellon D.M. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 1446-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Performing the same biochemical assays from five Hsp70 crossed with α-synuclein mice and three α-synuclein-only expressing mice (5-month-old), we found a significant ∼5-fold (5.27 ± 1.51) reduction in the amount of HMW species of α-synuclein (Fig. 3A). In addition, the amount of α-synuclein in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction was also decreased in the Hsp70 crossed with α-synuclein animals by ∼2-fold (35.74 ± 3.40% compared with 17.40 ± 6.36% in Fig. 3C). The total amount of SDS-soluble monomeric α-synuclein did not differ between these mice (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Hsp70 specifically reduced abnormal conformations without changing total amount of α-synuclein. Effect of Hsp70 on α-Synuclein Aggregation in Vitro—We previously reported that overexpression of C-terminally modified α-synuclein (Syn-T) as well as the naturally occurring rat syn-2 isoform (which has a different C terminus) led to the formation of intracellular α-synuclein-positive aggregates in H4 cells and that this phenomenon was increased by proteasome inhibition (31McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Shariff S. Hewett J. Sharma N. Ueda K. Breakefield X.O. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 32McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). By contrast, transient expression of untagged wild type α-synuclein did not produce intracellular inclusions. Co-expression of Syn-T with synphilin-1 facilitates the formation of intracellular aggregates (32McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), but synphilin-1 fails to induce aggregation when co-transfected with wild type α-synuclein. We used co-expression of Syn-T and synphilin-1 as an in vitro α-synuclein inclusion model (Fig. 4) to study the protective function of Hsp70 on α-synuclein aggregation. Interestingly, we observed α-synuclein species that were similar to the species detected in DLB cases and transgenic mice models in protein lysates of H4 cells transfected with Syn-T and synphilin-1. Native PAGE of total protein lysates revealed an α-synuclein-positive HMW product of molecular mass between 80 and 200 kDa (Fig. 5A, lane 1) that was not detected in cells transfected with the untagged (non-aggregating) wild type α-synuclein (lane 3) or mock-transfected cells (lane 5). In addition, we detected an ∼55-kDa α-synuclein-positive band under native PAGE condition in Syn-T and wild type α-synuclein-transfected cells but no monomeric (16 kDa) form of α-synuclein (Fig. 5A). Triton X-100 solubility testing revealed Triton X-100 insoluble α-synuclein only if cells were transfected with both Syn-T and synphilin-1 (Fig. 5C). Wild type α-synuclein was found in Triton X-100 soluble fractions exclusively (Fig. 5C). Co-transfection of synphilin-1 did not alter this pattern compared with omitting synphilin-1 (data not shown). We next asked whether Hsp70 can reduce the HMW and the Triton X-100 insoluble α-synuclein species in this model. Cotransfection of Hsp70 with Syn-T/synphilin-1 significantly reduced the HMW α-synuclein species (Fig. 5A, lane 2), consistent with the effect of crossing α-synuclein transgenic mice with Hsp70-overexpressing animals (Fig. 3). It also reduced the 55-kDa α-synuclein-positive band in Syn-T and wild type α-synuclein-transfected cells (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 4). Furthermore, quantification of the 16-kDa monomeric α-synuclein on SDS-PAGE in seven different experiments demonstrated that total α-synuclein expression levels were reduced by 45% by Hsp70 (Fig. 5B). Co-transfection with Hsp70 not only decreased total α-synuclein levels, it also reduced the Triton X-100 insoluble α-synuclein species in Syn-T-transfected H4 cells (Fig. 5C). To assess the refolding activities of Hsp70 on misfolded α-synuclein, we determined the ratio of Triton X-100 insoluble α-synuclein compared with the soluble fraction in six independent experiments. This enabled us to measure changes in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction independent of the total protein levels. A comparison of the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction in Hsp70 versus empty vector (control) co-transfected cells revealed that Hsp70 significantly reduced the percentage of α-synuclein in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction by ∼50% (Fig. 5D). Thus, Hsp70 leads to a decrease in the total amount of (misfolded) Syn-T as well as to a specific decrease in the percentage of Syn-T found in detergent-insoluble fraction, suggesting either chaperone-related “refolding” and/or specific degradation of the misfolded detergent-insoluble fraction. Influence of Hsp70 on Cellular Toxicity of α-Synuclein Overexpression—Because Hsp70 has been shown to be protective in α-synuclein-dependent toxicity in Drosophila, we examined the effect of Hsp70 on the toxicity of Syn-T, which forms macroscopic aggregates, and wild type α-synuclein, which does not form aggregates, in our cell culture model. Transfection with wild type α-synuclein alone increased the cellular toxicity by ∼2-fold (1.75 ± 0.16) compared with mock-transfected cells. Transfection with an irrelevant protein had no effect on toxicity (e.g. GFP, data not shown). Similarly, a ∼1.5-fold (1.56 ± 0.13-fold) increase in toxicity was observed by transfection with Syn-T. Interestingly, co-transfection with Hsp70 significantly reduced the toxicity of both wild type α-synuclein and Syn-T by ∼20% (Fig. 6). Thus, α-synuclein appears to be cytotoxic regardless of whether it might form aggregates. Hsp70 can protect in either case. Our data suggest two major conclusions. First, we describe abnormal detergent-insoluble forms of α-synuclein in human DLB cortex, α-synuclein transgenic mice, and tissue culture models of α-synuclein aggregation.

Sexual development of the parasite in the midgut is initiated in the lumen immediately after the mosquito ingests infected blood, and the resulting ookinetes must traverse the surrounding epithelial layer before transforming into oocysts. The innate immune system of the mosquito is activated during midgut invasion, but to date, no evidence has been published identifying mosquito immune genes that affect parasite development. Here, we show by gene silencing that an Anopheles gambiae leucine rich-repeat protein acts as an antagonist and two C-type lectines act as protective agonists on the development of Plasmodium ookinetes to oocysts."
https://openalex.org/W2089530258,"A large number of experimental studies and simulations show that it is surprisingly easy to find excellent quality control over broad classes of quantum systems. We now prove that for controllable quantum systems with no constraints placed on the controls, the only allowed extrema of the transition probability landscape correspond to perfect control or no control. Under these conditions, no suboptimal local extrema exist as traps that would impede the search for an optimal control. The identified landscape structure is universal for all controllable quantum systems of the same dimension when seeking to maximize the same transition probability, regardless of the detailed nature of the system Hamiltonian. The presence of weak control field noise or environmental decoherence is shown to preserve the general structure of the control landscape, but at lower resolution."

https://openalex.org/W2129430733,"We investigated the effect of synaptotagmin I on membrane fusion mediated by neuronal SNARE proteins, SNAP-25, syntaxin, and synaptobrevin, which were reconstituted into vesicles. In the presence of Ca 2+ , the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin I (syt) strongly stimulated membrane fusion when synaptobrevin densities were similar to those found in native synaptic vesicles. The Ca 2+ dependence of syt-stimulated fusion was modulated by changes in lipid composition of the vesicles and by a truncation that mimics cleavage of SNAP-25 by botulinum neurotoxin A. Stimulation of fusion was abolished by disrupting the Ca 2+ -binding activity, or by severing the tandem C2 domains, of syt. Thus, syt and SNAREs are likely to represent the minimal protein complement for Ca 2+ -triggered exocytosis."

We demonstrate nonlocal spin control by suppressing and splitting Kondo resonances in one quantum dot by changing the electron number and coupling of the other dot. The results suggest an approach to nonlocal spin control that may be relevant to quantum information processing."

To test whether the APP intracellular domain (AICD) functions analogously, we investigated how APP and Fe65 transactivate a Gal4 fusion protein of Tip60. Consistent with the Notch paradigm, we observe that γ-cleavage of APP and nuclear translocation of Fe65 are required for transactivation.

Membrane-tethered AICD recruits Fe65 and mediates the activation of bound Fe65 that is then released for nuclear translocation by γ-cleavage together with the AICD.

https://openalex.org/W2031722646,"The defining morphological feature of chemical synapses is the vesicle cluster in the presynaptic nerve terminal. It has generally been assumed that vesicles closest to release sites are recruited first during nerve activity. We tested this by selectively labeling the “readily releasable” pool, those vesicles released first during physiological stimulation. The readily releasable vesicles were not clustered close to the presynaptic membrane but instead were dispersed almost randomly throughout the vesicle cluster. Thus, vesicles are not recruited according to proximity to release sites but are mobilized differently, perhaps by being peeled from the surface of the cluster."

https://openalex.org/W2005735676,"Highwire (Hiw), a putative RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates synaptic growth at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in Drosophila. hiw mutants have dramatically larger synaptic size and increased numbers of synaptic boutons. Here we show that Hiw binds to the Smad protein Medea (Med). Med is part of a presynaptic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling cascade consisting of three receptor subunits, Wit, Tkv, and Sax, in addition to the Smad transcription factor Mad. When compared to wild-type, mutants of BMP signaling components have smaller NMJ size, reduced neurotransmitter release, and aberrant synaptic ultrastructure. BMP signaling mutants suppress the excessive synaptic growth in hiw mutants. Activation of BMP signaling, which in wild-type does not cause additional growth, in hiw mutants does lead to further synaptic expansion. These results reveal a balance between positive BMP signaling and negative regulation by Highwire, governing the growth of neuromuscular synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2038212389,"During sustained action potential (AP) firing at nerve terminals, the rates of endocytosis compared to exocytosis determine how quickly the available synaptic vesicle pool is depleted, in turn influencing presynaptic efficacy. Mechanisms, including rapid kiss-and-run endocytosis as well as local, preferential recycling of docked vesicles, have been proposed as a means to allow endocytosis and recycling to keep up with stimulation. We show here that, for CNS nerve terminals at physiological temperatures, endocytosis is sufficiently fast to avoid vesicle pool depletion during continuous AP firing at 10 Hz. This endocytosis-exocytosis balance persists for turnover of the entire releasable pool of vesicles and allows for efficient escape of FM 4-64, indicating that it is a non-kiss-and-run endocytic event. Thus, under physiological conditions, the sustained speed of vesicle membrane retrieval for the entire releasable pool appears to be sufficiently fast to compensate for exocytosis, avoiding significant vesicle pool depletion during robust synaptic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2086890785,"Exocytosis involves the formation of a fusion pore that connects the lumen of secretory vesicles with the extracellular space. Exocytosis from neurons and neuroendocrine cells is tightly regulated by intracellular [Ca2+] and occurs rapidly, but the molecular events that mediate the opening and subsequent dilation of fusion pores remain to be determined. A putative Ca2+ sensor for release, synaptotagmin I (syt), binds directly to syntaxin and SNAP-25, which are components of a conserved membrane fusion complex. Here, we show that Ca2+-triggered syt•SNAP-25 interactions occur rapidly. The tandem C2 domains of syt cooperate to mediate binding to syntaxin/SNAP-25; lengthening the linker that connects C2A and C2B selectively disrupts this interaction. Expression of the linker mutants in PC12 cells results in graded reductions in the stability of fusion pores. Thus, the final step of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis is regulated, at least in part, by direct contacts between syt and SNAP-25/syntaxin."

Cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61), from the CCN gene family, is a secreted and matrix-associated protein, which is involved in many cellular activities such as growth and differentiation. Here we established a cell model system to examine whether stable expression of Cyr61 in MCF-7 cells can confer resistance to apoptosis and identify possible participating mechanisms. We showed that stable cell lines overexpressing Cyr61 had acquired a remarkable resistance to apoptosis induced by paclitaxel, adriamycin, and β-lapachone. Most interesting, gel shift and reporter assays showed that the Cyr61-overexpressing cells had significantly increased NF-κB activity compared with neo control cells. Blockage of NF-κB activity in Cyr61-expressing cells by transfecting with a dominant negative (DN)-IκB or with an NF-κB decoy rendered them more susceptible to anti-cancer drugs-induced apoptosis. In addition, several NF-κB-regulated anti-apoptotic genes were examined, and we found that only XIAP showed a significant 3–4-fold increase in mRNA and protein in Cyr61-overexpressing cells but not in neo control cells. Treatment with inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)-specific antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides abolished the apoptosis resistance of the Cyr61-overexpressing cells.

A. 1982; 79: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The third protein, protective antigen (PA83, 83 kDa), binds to cellular receptors and transports LF and EF to the cytosol. The initial step in the action of the toxin is the binding of PA to a cell surface receptor. Receptor-bound PA is cleaved into two fragments by a furin family protease (4Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation of the smaller fragment allows the larger fragment, which remains receptor-bound, to self-associate into ring-shaped heptamers ((PA63)7, also referred to as prepore (5Milne J.C. Furlong D. Hanna P.C. Wall J.S. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Prepore may then bind up to three molecules of LF and/or EF with nanomolar affinity (6Elliott J.L. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The resulting complexes are endocytosed to an acidic compartment (8Friedlander A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7123-7126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Abrami L. Liu S. Cosson P. Leppla S.H. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), where the heptamers are converted from the prepore state to an integral membrane, ion-conductive pore (10Blaustein R.O. Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2209-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The process of translocating LF and EF into the cytosol is linked to the formation of pore, but the nature of this linkage is poorly understood. Within the cytosol these enzymatically active moieties may then disrupt normal cellular physiology. Two anthrax toxin receptors, CMG2 (11Scobie H.M. Rainey G.J.A. Bradley K.A. Young J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and anthrax toxin receptor (ATR)/tumor endothelial marker 8 (12Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), are known. Each is a single peptide chain consisting of an extracellular domain, a membrane-spanning region, and a cytoplasmic tail. In their extracellular domains, there is an ∼200-amino acid von Willebrand type A (VWA) domain that shows 60% amino acid identity between the two proteins (11Scobie H.M. Rainey G.J.A. Bradley K.A. Young J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). This domain adopts a dinucleotide binding or Rossmann fold that is composed of a sandwich of six eight amphipathic α-helices that surround a hydrophobic β-sheet (see Fig. 1B). 2D. B. Lacy, D. J. Wigelsworth, H. M. Scobie, J. A. T. Young, and R. J. Collier, submitted for publication.2D. B. Lacy, D. J. Wigelsworth, H. M. Scobie, J. A. T. Young, and R. J. Collier, submitted for publication. The VWA domain fold is found in many cell adhesion proteins and generally promotes protein-protein interactions (13Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Many VWA domains contain a highly conserved metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) that is often involved in ligand interactions (14Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The metal ion adopts an octahedral geometry and is coordinated by residues from three of its loops as well as two to three ordered water molecules. Usually, a glutamic or aspartic acid side chain from the ligand completes this metal ion coordination sphere; therefore, the metal ion acts as a bridge between the ligand and VWA domain. Consistent with a metal ion-mediated interaction, both CMG2 and ATR have been shown to bind PA more tightly in the presence of divalent cations (11Scobie H.M. Rainey G.J.A. Bradley K.A. Young J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 12Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Here, we quantify the binding interaction of soluble CMG2 VWA domain with PA83 monomer and PA63 heptamer. Monomeric PA bound a stoichiometric equivalent of CMG2, whereas the heptameric prepore form bound 7 eq. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for CMG2 VWA domain interaction with monomeric PA83 is very tight (170 pm), and the dissociation rate constant is extremely slow (∼10-5 s-1). We show that the tight binding affinity relies on the presence and identity of the divalent MIDAS metal ion. Knowledge of the affinity and slow dissociation rate of CMG2·PA complexes supports the notion that CMG2 VWA domain may be used clinically as an inhibitor of anthrax toxin. Plasmid Construction—A DNA sequence encoding residues 35–225 of the CMG2 VWA domain (referred to as CMG235–225) was cloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) using 5′ BamHI and 3′ NotI restriction sites. pGEX4T-1 includes a thrombin-cleavable glutathione S-transferase tag onto the amino terminus of the expressed protein. Two truncated versions of CMG2 were then generated using PCR and the same 5′ BamHI and 3′ NotI sites, (i) residues 38–218 (CMG2S38) and (ii) residues 40–217 (CMG2R40). The latter version eliminated the natural disulfide bond. To generate a version of CMG2 with a single, unique cysteine point mutation on the amino terminus, two successive rounds of site-directed mutagenesis were performed on CMG2R40. The C175A mutation was introduced to eliminate the remaining buried cysteine, and the R40C mutation created a unique cysteine residue on the more accessible amino terminus, making CMG2C40. Preparation of Proteins—Recombinant lethal factor amino-terminal domain (residues 1–263; LFN) was purified as described previously (15Croney J.C. Cunningham K.M. Collier R.J. Jameson D.M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Recombinant PA was expressed in BL21(DE3) using pET22b-PA (Novagen), which directs expression to the periplasm. Growth and expression of PA was carried out in a 10-liter Bioflo 110 fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific). Using ECPM1 growth media (16Barnard A. Payton M. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Plough H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. 5.3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1995: 1-18Google Scholar), cells were grown at 37 °C to ∼5 A600 nm units, sparged by a 60% air, O2 mixture, and induced at 30 °C using 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. PA was extracted from the periplasm and further purified using Q-Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (Buffer A), and Buffer A + 1 m NaCl (Buffer B). The protein was further purified using an S-200 Superdex gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in Buffer A. For fluorescence studies PA83 with either the K563C or E733C point mutation was purified as described previously (15Croney J.C. Cunningham K.M. Collier R.J. Jameson D.M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C in 10 mg/ml aliquots in 10 mm dithiothreitol. CMG2 VWA domain variants were grown in a similar way, except induction was carried out at 37 °C. Harvested bacteria were lysed by French press and sonication. GST-CMG2 was loaded onto a ∼50-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences), the column was washed in Buffer A, and bound fusion was cleaved from the immobilized GST using bovine α-thrombin (Sigma) overnight at room temperature. Thrombin was removed from the eluate with benzamidine-Sepharose, and CMG2 was further purified using an S-200 Superdex column (Amersham Biosciences). The purified stock protein solution was concentrated to 10 mg/ml, 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to protect the free thiol, and the solution was frozen at -80 °C. Fluorescence Labeling and Modification of PA and CMG2—Buffers A and B were purged by sparging with N2 for 5 min, and 0.5 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was added to each buffer. An S-200 gel filtration column was preequilibrated with 15% Buffer B. Approximately 20 mg of either PA83 K563C, PA83 E733C, or CMG2C40 was purified using gel filtration to remove excess dithiothreitol, which would react with the maleimide-activated fluorophores. One mg of either maleimide thiol reactive fluorophore, Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) or Alexa Fluor 546 (AF546), was added to each protein eluate in approximately a 10-ml volume (2 mg/ml final protein concentration) for 2 h at room temperature. Two separate preparations of PA83 K563C were labeled with AF488 donor and AF546 acceptor; PA83 E733C was labeled with the donor AF488, making PA83 E733C-AF488, and CMG2C40 was labeled with the acceptor AF546, making CMG2C40-AF546. After the completion of the reaction, unreacted dye reagent was blocked with 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and labeled protein was subsequently purified from free dye by a second round of S-200 gel filtration using 15% Buffer B in the absence of tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Protein solutions were assessed for labeling efficiency using predetermined extinction coefficients for the fluorophores at their respective absorbance maxima and 280 nm. Labeling efficiency was 95% or greater. Uniformly labeled PA heptamer, (PA63)7 E733C-AF488, was generated as previously described (17Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7049-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Using an identical procedure, CMG2C40 was blocked at the reactive cysteine by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), creating CMG2C40-NEM. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Experiments were carried out using a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal) at 30 °C. PA83 monomer (5 μm) and CMG235–225 (70 μm) were degassed at 30 °C under vacuum. Multiple injections of CMG235–225 were made into the PA83-containing measurement cell under continuous stirring. Data were analyzed using Microcal Origin software. Fluorescence Equilibrium Stoichiometry Titration—PA83 E733C-AF488 was diluted to 1 μm in 2 ml of universal buffer, 10 mm each Tris, MES, HEPES, and acetic acid, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0, that was supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2. 100-μl aliquots were iteratively removed after the addition of sub-stoichiometric quantities of CMG2C40-AF546, thereby continually increasing the molar ratio of CMG2·PA83 during the titration from 0.1 to 5.2. Each 100-μl aliquot was separately incubated for about 1–2 h at room temperature to ensure complete binding. Similarly, (PA63)7 E733C-AF488 was diluted to 16 nm; however, 0.5 μm LFN was added to the reaction mixture to minimize nonspecific interactions with the PA-LF binding face. The molar ratio was varied as described for PA83 except the range spanned 0.3–25. Each aliquot was then analyzed in an ISS fluorimeter interfaced to an Ar+ laser. The 488-nm line was used for excitation of the donor fluorophore (AF488). Donor and acceptor emission were acquired at 520 and 570 (±10) nm, respectively. The apparent fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal was defined by the ratio of the acceptor to donor fluorescence emission. Aliquots were diluted to 2 ml in universal buffer. Fluorescence counts were recorded for 10 s, and all aliquots in a given titration were measured in triplicate. Multiangle Laser Light Scattering—Approximately 200–400 μg of protein was loaded in specific mixtures onto a Shodex KW-803 column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1 in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.5. The column was connected to a DAWN EOS 18-angle light scattering detector and an OPTILAB DSP interferometric refractometer (Wyatt Technology). Detectors 6–15 were used. A refractive index increment value (dn/dc) of 0.185 ml/g was used. Detectors were normalized to compensate for slight differences in electronic gain using bovine serum albumin as an isotropic scatterer. Data were analyzed using ASTRA software. Kinetics of PA63 Heptamerization—The FRET-based kinetics assay was used to monitor the rate of heptamerization for PA63. A reaction mixture of fluorescently labeled nicked PA83 (50 nm each donor, AF488, and acceptor, AF546) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Ca2+, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 8.5, was either preincubated with no CMG235–225 or 1 μm CMG235–225 at 20 °C for 15 min. At time 0 each heptamerization reaction was initiated by the addition of 100 nm LFN. Control experiments were performed in the absence of LFN. Kinetic profiles were recorded using the ISS fluorimeter (excitation, 488 nm), where the emission at 520 and 570 (±10) nm reflected the increase in apparent FRET upon heptamerization. Time points were taken automatically every 15 s for 7 × 103 s. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—All experiments were performed using the Biacore 2000 system sensor chips. For CM5 chips, the system was maintained at a constant flow rate of 5 μl min-1 of HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) at 25 °C. Monomeric PA83 was covalently linked to the carboxylated dextran matrix. Monomeric PA83 was diluted to 2 μm in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. The protein was injected onto the activated surface at a flow rate of 5 μl min-1 until the desired base-line level of 2000–4000 response units was obtained (∼5 min) and then blocked with ethanolamine. CMG2 VWA domain variants were diluted into HBS running buffer with either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm CaCl2 plus 0.5 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH 7.4, and serial injections were made at 10 μl min-1. Concentrations of protein ranged from 47 nm to 4.8 μm. CM5 base lines were regenerated with a 30-μl pulse of 0.5 m NaCO3, pH 10.5, resulting in <1% loss of base line per injection. Binding Kinetics Using FRET—All kinetics experiments were conducted at 20 °C. Rates of association between CMG2 and PA were assessed using stopped-flow FRET. A Biologic SFM-400 stopped-flow was fitted to a custom two channel filter fluorimeter. An Ar+ laser was used for excitation at 488 nm via a fiber optic cable. Two H5784-20 photosensor modules (Hamamatsu) were controlled via the manufacturer's recommended resistance programming circuit; the photosensors collected a fluorescent emission signal after optical filtering (Omega) by a notch, bandpass filter (520–540 nm) in channel 1 and a longpass filter (>560 nm) in channel 2. These emission signals were then electronically filtered by an 11-pole elliptical function filter (TTE, Inc.) before collection by the computer A/D card. During acquisition, the computer divided the signal in channel 1 by the signal in channel 2 to obtain an apparent FRET ratio. For association kinetics experiments, all four syringes of the stopped-flow were used. Buffer solutions contained universal buffer, which was supplemented by either 2 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, or 2 mm each EDTA and EGTA. All protein solutions were diluted into modified universal buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. In all experiments, at least a 5-fold excess of CMG2 to PA83 was delivered to maintain pseudo-first order reaction conditions. Total shot volumes were 300 μl. Flow rates ranged from 7 to 15 ml s-1, and the dead time was estimated at 1–2 ms. Three to four kinetic transients were averaged per rate determination. For ultraslow dissociation kinetics experiments (104–105 s) the ISS fluorimeter was used instead of the stopped-flow. Here a 1.6-ml sample was made in universal buffer containing 50 nm PA83 E733C-AF488 and 100 nm CMG2C40-AF546. At time 0, 2 μm CMG2C40-NEM was manually added. FRET was monitored as stated above. Dissociation was reported by the loss of FRET signal due to the presence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled CMG2C40-NEM. Time points were taken automatically every 10 s over 3 × 104 s for Ca2+-liganded complex. For Mg2+-liganded complex multiple time spacing was measured over several days, first every 100 s for 5 × 104 s and then multiple time courses of 2000 s with points spaced out to 2 × 105 s. Kinetic and Equilibrium Data Analysis—Binding association and dissociation rate constants, ka and kd, respectively, were obtained by fitting to a monoexponential model (Equation 1), whereas PA heptamerization kinetics were fit to a second order model (Equation 2),A(t)=A exp(−kobs×t)+C(Eq. 1) A(t)=A/(1+kobs×t)+C(Eq. 2) where the amplitude at time 0, A, decays with respect to time, t. The offset, C, is the final value reached when the system achieves equilibrium. For binding association kinetics, pseudo-first-order conditions are maintained, i.e. CMG2 concentrations are >5-fold above the concentration of PA83. Observed kinetic rate constants (kobs) were separately fit or averaged to obtain association and dissociation rate constants. Equilibrium dissociation constants are calculated from kinetic measurements of the association and dissociation rate constants according to KD = kd/ka. Expression and Purification of CMG2 VWA Domain—Recombinant CMG2 VWA domain (CMG235–225) was fused to the carboxyl terminus of GST, and the resulting GST-CMG2 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was affinity-purified from bacterial extract on a glutathione-Sepharose column. The protein was cleaved on the column with thrombin, releasing the CMG2 VWA domain into the fluid phase in almost pure form. After an additional size-exclusion chromatography step, the CMG2 VWA domain was obtained in high purity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). PA83 Binds 1 Stoichiometric Equivalent of CMG2 VWA Domain—We measured the stoichiometry of CMG2 VWA domain binding to PA83 by three independent methods, isothermal titration calorimetry, FRET-based titration, and size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle laser light scattering. For isothermal titration calorimetry measurements, PA83 was loaded into the measurement cell, and CMG235–225 was added in small increments under continuous stirring. The concentration of PA83 used was 5 μm, orders of magnitude above the Kd (see Table I), allowing incremental substoichiometric amounts of CMG235–225 to bind PA83 quantitatively up to the point of saturation. As shown in Fig. 2, saturation by CMG235–225 was achieved at approximately a one-to-one molar ratio (1.03 ± 5 ×10-3).Table IKinetic and thermodynamic parameters for binding of CMG2 to PA83ProteinMetal ion bufferMethodkakdKdΔΔGm2+m-1 s-1s-1maThe equilibrium dissociation constant is calculated from kinetic measurements of the association and dissociation rate constants according to Kd = kd/kakcal mol-1CMG235–2251 mm Ca2+SPR1.7 × 105 ± 7 × 1047 × 10-5 ± 5 × 10-54 × 10-10 ± 2 × 10-10NDbND, not determinedCMG2s381 mm Ca2+SPR9.0 × 104 ± 7 × 103NDNDNDReduced S-ScNatural disulfide (Cys-39–Cys-218) is reduced by 0.5 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphineCMG2r401 mm Ca2+SPR8.1 × 104 ± 2 × 1034 × 10-5 ± 2 × 10-55 × 10-10 ± 2 × 10-10NDCMG2c40-AF5461 mm Ca2+FRET1.1 × 105 ± 5 × 1038.4 × 10-5 ± 5 × 10-77.8 × 10-10 ± 3 × 10-11-4.2 ± 0.05CMG2c40-AF5462 mm Mg2+FRET5.3 × 104 ± 9 × 1029.2 × 10-6 ± 1 × 10-71.7 × 10-10 ± 9 × 10-13-5.1 ± 0.051 mm EGTACMG2c40-AF5462 mm EDTAFRET9.3 × 104 ± 7 × 1038.6 × 10-2 ± 4 × 10-39.6 × 10-7 ± 8 × 10-8ND2 mm EGTAa The equilibrium dissociation constant is calculated from kinetic measurements of the association and dissociation rate constants according to Kd = kd/kab ND, not determinedc Natural disulfide (Cys-39–Cys-218) is reduced by 0.5 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine Open table in a new tab In a second approach we used FRET to report on the binding of CMG2 VWA domain and PA83 under equilibrium conditions. A donor fluorophore (AF488) was attached to PA83 via a unique, introduced cysteine (E733C), creating PA83 E733C-AF488. A truncated version of CMG2, CMG2R40, was modified on its amino terminus to have a single cysteine (CMG2C40), which served as a unique site for fluorescent dye attachment. CMG2C40 was labeled by the acceptor fluorophore, AF546. The donor was excited by the 488-nm Ar+ laser line, and binding was reported by sensitized emission from the acceptor. The Förster distance, Ro, for these two fluorophores is ∼60 Å; distances up to ∼100 Å generate enough signal to report binding. The degree of donor quenching indicated that the donor and acceptor in the PA·CMG2C40 complex are ∼60–70 Å apart (Fig. 3A). The concentration of PA used (1 μm), far above the Kd, yielded a titration style plot (Fig. 3B). Successive additions of the acceptor CMG2 increased the FRET signal until all PA83 acceptor was bound, and no additional FRET was observed upon further additions. The intersection of two lines from separate linear fits to the sub-stoichiometric and saturation data defines a binding stoichiometry of 1.0 ± 0.1. Using size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle laser light scattering, the measured molecular mass of the PA83·CMG235–225 complex, isolated as a discrete peak, was 98 kDa and agrees with the theoretical value, 104 kDa, for a one-to-one complex. Molecular mass values were constant across the peak, indicating homogeneity of the complex. PA63 Heptamer Binds 7 Eq of CMG235–225—We performed a FRET binding titration assay similar to that carried out on monomeric PA83 to determine the number of CMG2 VWA domains that bind uniformly labeled (PA63)7. Fluorescently labeled PA83 was treated with trypsin, and the PA63 fraction was isolated by anion-exchange chromatography. This fraction was shown earlier to be heptameric by light scattering (7Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (18Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). For fluorescence titrations, successive substoichiometric additions of the acceptor CMG2 increased the FRET signal until all (PA63)7 binding sites were saturated. Subsequent additions revealed no additional FRET (Fig. 3C). The solution of the intersecting linear fits of data compiled from three separate titrations defines a binding stoichiometry of 7.1 ± 0.3 CMG2 VWA domains per heptamer. Mass estimates from size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle laser light scattering showed that (PA63)7 binds at least 5 molecules of CMG235–225 but values of the masses were not sufficiently accurate to confirm the 7-fold stoichiometry offered by FRET. This approach suffered from the fact that the mass of each molecule of CMG235–225 (21 kDa) that bound to (PA63)7 (441 kDa) is equivalent to the measurement error for this method when working in the half-million dalton range (±5%). Does CMG235–225 Affect the Rate of PA63 Heptamerization?—We developed a second novel FRET method to monitor (PA63)7 prepore formation in solution to test whether CMG235–225 affected the assembly process. In this assay donor (AF488)- and acceptor (AF546)-labeled PA83 were made by modifying a unique, solvent-accessible cysteine engineered at residue 563. Fluorescently labeled PA83 proteins were then nicked with trypsin. The heptamerization reaction mixture contained equimolar amounts of nicked donor and acceptor PA83 (50 nm each). At time 0, LFN (the LF amino-terminal domain) was added (100 nm) to initiate the reaction. Control experiments verified that LFN accelerated the heptamerization reaction. The rate of heptamerization was reported by the increase in FRET due to the incorporation of donor and acceptor PA63 into the (PA63)7·LFN complex (Fig. 4). The kinetics fit to a second order"
https://openalex.org/W2091314916,"We compared behavioral and neural effects of cholinergic enhancement between spatial attention, spatial working memory (WM), and visual control tasks, using fMRI and the anticholinesterase physostigmine. Physostigmine speeded responses nonselectively but increased accuracy selectively for attention. Physostigmine also decreased activations to visual stimulation across all tasks within primary visual cortex, increased extrastriate occipital cortex activation selectively during maintained attention and WM encoding, and decreased parietal activation selectively during maintained attention. Finally, lateralization of occipital activation as a function of the visual hemifield toward which attention or memory was directed was decreased under physostigmine. In the case of attention, this effect correlated strongly with a decrease in a behavioral measure of selective spatial processing. Our results suggest that, while cholinergic enhancement facilitates visual attention by increasing activity in extrastriate cortex generally, it accomplishes this in a manner that reduces expectation-driven selective biasing of extrastriate cortex."

Our results suggest that ET-1 induces a program of matrix synthesis in lung fibroblasts and that ET-1 may play a key role in connective tissue deposition during wound repair and in pulmonary fibrosis. As a response to environmental insults or a consequence of local inflammatory processes, structural damage to tissue can occur, triggering a wound-healing response. This response consists of an integrated series of biochemical, immunological, and structural changes that result in the de novo synthesis of a new epithelium, blood vessels, and connective tissue (1Werner S. Grose R. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 835-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar). The proper repair of connective tissue requires the synthesis and organization of new ECM 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ET, endothelium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; SEAP, secreted enhanced alkaline phosphatase; TGF, transforming growth factor; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase.1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ET, endothelium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; SEAP, secreted enhanced alkaline phosphatase; TGF, transforming growth factor; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase. components, such as collagen and fibronectin (2Badylak S.F. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence implicates the vasoconstrictive peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) as a key mediator of tissue repair (3Bull H.A. Dowd P.M. Dermatology. 1993; 187: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Each of the three known endothelin isoforms (-1, -2, and -3) arise by proteolytic processing of large precursors (∼200 amino acid residues). Intermediates, termed big ET-1, -2, and -3 (38-41 amino acids), are excised from pre-propeptides at sites containing paired basic amino acids. Big endothelins, which have little or no biological activity (4Yanagisawa M. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1320-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), are cleaved at Trp-21-Val/Ile-22 to produce mature, 21-residue, biologically active peptides (5Anggard E.E. Botting R.M. Vane J.R. Blood Vessels. 1990; 27: 269-281PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rubanyi G.M. Botelho L.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for the specific cleavage at Trp-21 has been termed the endothelin-converting enzyme (7Ohnaka K. Takayanagi R. Nishikawa M. Haji M. Nawata H. J. Biol.

Elevated levels of ET-1 have been shown in patients with fibrotic disease, suggesting that ET-1 may play a key role not only in normal wound repair but also in the pathogenesis of fibrosis (10Vancheeswaran R.

ET-1 demonstrates a wide range of biological properties, including significant mitogenic activity toward a number of cell types such as smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (15Levin E.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). ET-1 also promotes the contractile ability of normal fibroblasts (16Guidry C. Hook M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which is essential for wound closure and reconstitution of the dermis (17Grinnell F. J.

For example, ET-1 enhances collagen types I and III and decreases matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) mRNA and protein expression in dermal fibroblasts (18Xu S. Denton C.P. Holmes A. Dashwood M.R.

However, the signal transduction mechanism and transcription factors through which ET-1 affects gene expression is largely unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent ET-1 might contribute to wound repair or fibrogenic responses. In this report, we investigate the functional and mechanistic contribution of ET-1 to matrix synthesis in primary human lung fibroblasts. Our results provide new insights into ET-1 biology and suggest a role for ET-1 in enhancing matrix expression and organization during tissue repair and fibrogenesis. Cell Culture—Primary human lung fibroblasts were grown from macroscopically and histologically normal lung resection specimens by explant culture as described previously (21Shi-Wen X. Denton C.P. McWhirter A. Bou-Gharious G. Abraham D.J. du Bois R.M. Black C.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were used between passages 2 and 5. Gene Array Analysis—Lung fibroblasts were serum starved for 18 h and treated with 100 nm ET-1 for 4 h. At the end of the treatment period, total RNA was harvested (Trizol; Invitrogen) and quantified, and integrity was verified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Equal amounts of identically treated RNA were pooled and reverse transcribed (Invitrogen) into cDNA, which was then in vitro transcribed into biotinylated cRNA. The target cRNA was then fragmented and hybridized to the Affymetrix human U133A array following Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) protocol. Hybridization of cRNA to Affymetrix human U133A chips, signal amplification, and data collection were performed using an Affymetrix fluidics station and chip reader. Chip files were scaled to an average intensity of 100 per gene and analyzed using the Affymetrix version 5.0 (MAS5) comparison analysis software. Experiments were performed twice, and the fold changes presented in Table I are an average of these independent studies. Criteria indicated by Affymetrix were used to determine robust changes in gene expression. Briefly, transcripts were defined as up-regulated by ET-1 only when identified as “present” (ET-1-treated chips) by the Affymetrix detection algorithm and “significantly increased,” as determined by the Affymetrix change algorithm, with a change p value of <0.01. The fold change between treated and untreated samples had to be at least 1.5-fold to identify a transcript as being altered. These criteria had to be met in both sets of experiments. We have entered one experiment (ET-1 untreated/treated) in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) as samples GSM15500 and GSM15501, and the other experiment has been entered as GSM17262 and GSM17263. The GEO series, including all samples, has been entered as GSE1081 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo).Table ITranscripts induced in human lung fibroblasts after treatment with 100 nm endothelin-1 for 4 hGenBank™ no.Affymetrix no.Fold increaseaMean of two pairs of array experiments; gene selection criteria included a 1.5-fold increase and an “increased” call by Affymetrix algorithm (p < 0.01) in both setsGene nameNM_003474202952_s_at3.1A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 12NM_003474213790_at4.4A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 12NM_023038209765_at3.2A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 19NM_000095205713_s_at11.9Cartilage oligomeric matrix proteinNM_004385204619_s_at1.8Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 2 (versican)NM_001845211980_at1.6Collagen, type IV, α1NM_000093212488_at1.6collagen, type V, α1NM_000094204136_at3.9collagen, type VII, α1NM_001901209101_at4.8CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor)NM_002006204421_s_at5.0Fibroblast growth factor 2 (basic)NM_002006204422_s_at4.5Fibroblast growth factor 2 (basic)NM_002203205032_at2.3Integrin, α2NM_002205201389_at1.8Integrin, α5NM_000212204627_s_at4.4Integrin, β3NM_002421204475_at2.5Matrix metalloproteinase 1NM_002422205828_at4.1Matrix metalloproteinase 3NM_000935202619_s_at2.4Procollagen-lysine (lysine hydroxylase) 2NM_002997201287_s_at1.5Syndecan 1NM_003246201109_s_at2.5Thrombospondin 1NM_000362201148_s_at2.1Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3NM_000362201150_s_at2.1Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3a Mean of two pairs of array experiments; gene selection criteria included a 1.5-fold increase and an “increased” call by Affymetrix algorithm (p < 0.01) in both sets Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis—Lung fibroblasts were grown to confluence in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured in DMEM and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 24 h. To ascertain the effect of ET-1 on CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, or CTGF) expression, cells were stimulated with 100 nm ET-1 for 48 h with 0.5% bovine serum albumin treatment. To assess the effect of ET-1 on the stimulation of signaling pathways, ET-1 was added to cells for up to 16 h. When appropriate, cells were incubated with an inhibitor for 45 min prior to the addition of ET-1. The activities of inhibitors were verified by examining their ability to block phosphorylation of Akt or by assessing their ability to block induction of promoters responsive to particular signaling cascades (Clontech). Cell layer lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. CCN2 protein was detected using an anti-CCN2 (CTGF) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAPDH) protein was detected using an anti-GAPDH antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Akt, phospho-Akt, p38, phospho-p38, p42/44 MAPK, and phospho-p42/44 MAPK were detected using antibodies as described by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Blots were then hybridized with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and protein was detected using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Promoter Assays—CCN2 promoter/secreted enhanced alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter constructs were as described previously (25Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 26Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol.

Promoter/reporter constructs were transfected into lung fibroblasts using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Promoter/reporter plasmids were cotransfected with pCMV-βGal (Clontech), which was used to adjust for differences in transfection efficiencies between samples. Following transfection, cells were incubated in DMEM with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 18 h. Media were changed, and cells were incubated in the presence or absence of inhibitors for 45 min and cultured for an additional 24 h in the presence or absence of ET-1 (100 nm). Media were taken for SEAP assays. Fibroblasts were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and cellular protein was extracted using 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp, Madison, WI). Reporter gene activity was measured by luminometry (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) using SEAP and β-galactosidase assays (Tropix Inc. Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Values given are mean ± S.E. of triplicate assays from three individual experiments. Reverse Transcription PCR—Lung fibroblasts were serum-starved for 18 h and treated with 100 nm ET-1 for 2, 4, or 12 h. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and the integrity of the RNA was verified by gel electrophoresis. Total RNA (10 μg) was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl reaction volume containing an oligonucleotide (dT18) and random decamers (dN10) using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cDNA was diluted to 100 μl with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water, and the target was measured by real time PCR FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Triplicate samples were run, transcripts were measured in picograms, and expression values were standardized to values obtained with control 28 S RNA primers. Primers (Sigma Genosys) were as follows: COL4A1, 5′-ATAGGTTTCCCAGGGCAGC3-′ (forward) and 5′-CCACGCTCTCCTTCAATCC-3′ (reverse); TSP1, 5′-CAGCTGGAAATGTGGTGCTTGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGTGGCATGTTCGACACCCT-3′ (reverse); TIMP3, 5′-GGCAGCAAGCAGATAGACTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGCTTGCTCCAGACTCAG-3′ (reverse); CCN2, 5′-CTCGCGGCTTACCGACTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCACTTGAACTCCACCGG-3′ (reverse); MMP-1, 5′-TCACCAAGGTCTCTGAGGGTCAAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATGCCATCAATGTCATCCTGAGC-3′ (reverse); and 28 S, 5′-TTGAAAATCCGGGGGAGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACATTGTTCCAACATGCCAG-3′ (reverse). Global Expression Profiling in Response to ET-1—To identify transcripts induced by ET-1, we treated primary lung fibroblasts for 4 h in the presence or absence of 100 nm ET-1. After this period of incubation, we harvested total RNA. Affymetrix U133A gene arrays were hybridized to these labeled cRNAs derived from the total RNA. Gene array analysis revealed that a 4-h treatment of primary lung fibroblasts with ET-1-modified expression of a cluster of transcripts encoding proteins that would be expected to promote matrix deposition and remodeling (Table I). ET-1 treatment induced expression of the matrix protein collagen types IV, V, and VII (27Handford P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ET-1 treatment also induced expression of the collagen-modifying enzyme lysyl oxidase (28Reiser K. McCormick R.J. Rucker R.B. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2439-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and the pro-adhesive and pro-fibrotic gene CCN2 (CTGF) (29Leask A. Denton C.P. Abraham D.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). ET-1 also induced thrombospondin-1, a multifunctional matricellular protein that promotes the function of many molecules involved with the wound-healing response, including transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) (30Crawford S.E. Stellmach V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Ribeiro S.M. Lawler J. Hynes R.O. Boivin G.P. Bouck N. Cell. 1998; 93: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), matrix metalloproteinases (31Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar), and focal adhesions (32Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In addition, ET-1 induced expression of the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotenases-3 (TIMP-3) and MMP-1 and -3, which adjust and control levels of matrix deposition (33Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other than MMP-1, all genes revealed by our transcriptional profiling are novel targets of ET-1 in fibroblasts (Table I). ET-1 Enhances CCN2 Expression through a MEK/ERK-dependent Mechanism—CCN2 (CTGF) is an important profibrotic protein that induces collagen and acts with TGFβ to promote sustained fibrosis in vivo (29Leask A. Denton C.P. Abraham D.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34Mori T. Kawara S. Shinozaki M. Hayashi N. Kakinuma T. Igarashi A. Takigawa M. Nakanishi T. Takehara K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Because our array analysis showed that CCN2 mRNA was induced by ET-1 treatment, we sought to explore the notion that ET-1 might contribute to fibrotic responses in vivo through the induction of CCN2. Thus, we treated normal lung fibroblasts for 24 h with 100 nm ET-1. Cell layers were harvested, and equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-CCN2 antibody. Confirming our microarray data, we found that 100 nm ET-1 induced expression of CCN2 protein (Fig. 1). To begin to probe the signaling mechanism through which ET-1 induced CCN2, we performed Western blot analysis of protein extracts prepared from lung fibroblasts that had been treated with ET-1 for different lengths of time. Using anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-p38, and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies, we showed that ET-1 activated ERK (p42/p44), p38, and PI3-kinase/Akt pathways in lung fibroblasts (Fig. 2). To address the contribution of these pathways to the ET-1 induction of CCN2, we used Western blot analysis with an anti-CCN2 antibody to show that a 45-min pre-incubation with the MEK/ERK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 (35Dudley D.T.

Conversely, the addition of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (37Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) or the Akt/PI-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 (38Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 39Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had no discernible effect on the ability of ET-1 to modulate CCN2 production. In addition, a 45-min preincubation of lung fibroblasts with the dual specificity ETA/B receptor antagonist bosentan (40Teerlink J.R. Loffler B.M. Hess P. Maire J.P. Clozel M. Clozel J.P. Circulation. 1994; 90: 2510-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) blocked the ability of ET-1 to induce CCN2 (Fig. 1). Thus, ET-1 stimulated CCN2 protein expression in normal human lung fibroblasts through a MEK/ERK-dependent mechanism that required either the ETA or the ETB receptor. ET-1 Modifies Expression of Fibrogenic Genes in a MEK/ERK-dependent Mechanism—After determining that ET-1 induced CCN2 protein through a MEK/ERK-dependent mechanism, we decided to investigate further the contribution of MEK/ERK to ET-1 induced gene expression. Using real time polymerase chain reaction analysis, we confirmed that ET-1 induced MMP-1, CCN2, collagen IV, TSP-1, and TIMP-3 mRNAs (Fig. 3). Induction of MMP-1, CCN2, TSP-1, and TIMP-3 seemed to be direct, showing potent induction 2 h after the application of ET-1. To determine whether ET-1 induced these transcripts via a MEK/ERK-dependent mechanism, cells were pre-incubated for 45 min with or without the MEK/ERK MAP kinase inhibitor U0126 (10 μm) prior to the addition of ET-1. We found that pre-incubation of cells with U0126 potently inhibited the ability of ET-1 to induce MMP-1, CCN2, collagen IV, TSP-1, and TIMP-3 mRNA expression. Thus, ET-1 is a potent fibrogenic peptide, able to induce mRNA expression of matrix genes in lung fibroblasts via MEK/ERK. ET-1 Activates the CCN2 Promoter through the BCE-1 Element—After establishing that ET-1 induced the appearance of CCN2 protein and mRNA in lung fibroblasts, we sought to investigate further the mechanism through which ET-1 performs this function. For these experiments, we assessed whether an ET-1 response element existed in the CCN2 promoter. To perform this experiment, we transfected a full-length CCN2 promoter/SEAP reporter construct, spanning nucleotides -805 to +17 of the CCN2 promoter (Fig. 4, -805; Ref. 26Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15220-15225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), into lung fibroblasts. After an 18-h serum starvation step, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 nm ET-1 for an additional 24 h. Consistent with our data showing that ET-1 induced CCN2 protein and mRNA expression, we found that ET-1 induced CCN2 promoter activity (Fig. 4). To further delineate the ET-1 response element in the CCN2 promoter, we transfected two additional CCN2 promoter/SEAP reporter constructs into fibroblasts. These new constructs contained segments of the CCN2 promoter spanning nucleotides -244 to +17 (Fig. 4, -244) or -86 to +17 (Fig. 4, -86; Ref. 26Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15220-15225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We found that, although the fragment of the CCN2 promoter between -244 to +17 could respond to ET-1, the removal of nucleotides -244 to -86 abolished the ability of the CCN2 promoter to respond to ET-1 (Fig. 4). Thus, the ET-1 response element in the CCN2 promoter lay between nucleotides -244 and -86. Previously, we had analyzed the transcription factor binding sites lying between nucleotides -244 and -86 of the CCN2 promoter and identified a Smad binding element, which is required for the TGFβ-induction of CCN2, and a basal control element-1 (BCE-1) site, which is required for basal CCN2 expression but is not involved with the TGFβ-induction of CCN2 (25Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To assess the roles of Smad and BCE-1 elements in the ET-1 induction of the CCN2 promoter, we transfected into lung fibroblasts constructs that contained mutations in the Smad and BCE-1 elements of the CCN2 promoter (Smad and BCE-1, respectively, Fig. 4) but were otherwise identical to the full-length (-805 to +17) CCN2 promoter construct. We found that removal of the Smad element had no significant impact on the ability of the CCN2 reporter to respond to ET-1 (Fig. 4, -805 Smad). Conversely, removal of the BCE-1 element abolished the response of the CCN2 promoter to ET-1 (Fig. 4, -805 BCE-1). Thus, ET-1 promotes CCN2 expression in a fashion that is independent of Smad/TGFβ signaling but dependent on BCE-1. These results suggest that ET-1 promotes gene expression in a manner that is independent of TGFβ. In this study, we used primary human lung fibroblasts as an in vitro model with which to probe the role of ET-1 in ECM production. Previously, we have shown that ET-1 enhances collagen types I and III and decreases MMP-1 mRNA and protein expression in dermal fibroblasts (18Xu S. Denton C.P. Holmes A. Dashwood M.R. Abraham D.J.

In this report, we extend these results by showing that ET-1 in itself is capable of inducing the expression of ECM or ECM-associated genes. ET-1 induced collagen type IV, a key basement membrane component (41Neubauer K. Saile B. Ramadori G. Can. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 15: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ET-1 induced collagen type VII, the major component of anchoring fibrils that attach epidermis and dermis; mutations in the COL7A1 gene encoding type VII collagen cause a severe blistering disease, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (42Ryynanen M. Ryynanen J. Sollberg S. Iozzo R.V. Knowlton R.G. Uitto J. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 89: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, ET-1 induces collagen type V, which interacts with collagen type I to regulate the diameters of type I collagen fibrils (43Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, by the ability of ET-1 to induce collagens IV, V, and VII, ET-1 promotes the wound-healing response by enhancing reconstitution of the basement membrane and wound closure. ET-1 induces CCN2, a member of the CCN family of proteins (44Leask A. Abraham D.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 81: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 45Brigstock D.R. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 178: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). CCN2 is a cysteine-rich, pro-adhesive, matricellular protein that plays an essential role in the formation of blood vessels, bone, and connective tissue (46Ivkovic S. Yoon B.S. Popoff S.N. Safadi F.F. Libuda D.E. Stephenson R.C. Daluiski A. Lyons K.M. Development. 2003; 130: 2779-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Because the expression of this protein is potently induced by TGFβ in a Smad-dependent fashion (22Hakonarson H. Halapi E. Whelan R. Gulcher J. Stefansson K. Grunstein M.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it has been hypothesized that CCN2 mediates several of the downstream actions of TGFβ (26Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15220-15225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Ours is the first report to show that ET-1 induces CCN2 and, thus, that CCN2 could also be a downstream mediator of ET-1 activity. The ET-1 response element of the CCN2 promoter is independent of its Smad element, which is required for the TGFβ-induction of CCN2 (22Hakonarson H. Halapi E. Whelan R. Gulcher J. Stefansson K. Grunstein M.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 47Leask A. Holmes A. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13008-13015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Instead, the ET-1 induction of CCN2 occurs through the BCE-1 element of the CCN2 promoter, which is not required for the TGFβ-induction of CCN2 (22Hakonarson H. Halapi E. Whelan R. Gulcher J. Stefansson K. Grunstein M.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results suggest that TGFβ and ET-1 might work independently on the CCN2 promoter to elevate CCN2 expression in vivo and, thus, that TGFβ and ET-1 might cooperate to produce fibrogenic responses in vivo thorough the coordinate induction of CCN2 (Fig. 5). The identity of the factor(s) binding to the BCE-1 site of the CCN2 promoter is not known but is currently under investigation. It is interesting to note that we have shown previously that a 48-h treatment of normal dermal fibroblasts with ET-1 caused the induction of collagen type I mRNA (20Shi-Wen X. Denton C.P. Dashwood M.R. Holmes A.M. Bou-Gharios G. Pearson J.D. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. J. Invest Dermatol. 2001; 116: 417-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In this report, using normal lung fibroblasts, our transcriptional profiling using the Affymetrix system showed that ET-1 did not induce collagen type I mRNA after 4 h. Using real time PCR, we confirmed that ET-1 induced type I collagen mRNA commencing 6 h after ET-1 treatment (not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that the ability of ET-1 to induce type I collagen might be indirect. However, in this report we showed appreciable induction of CCN2 and thrombospondin-1 mRNA 2 h after ET-1 treatment. CCN2 induces type I collagen (29Leask A. Denton C.P. Abraham D.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 48Grotendorst G.R.

Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and thrombospondin-1 activates latent TGFβ (30Crawford S.E. Stellmach V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Ribeiro S.M. Lawler J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26775-26782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of ET-1 to induce collagen type I expression may be indirect, possibly via the induction of CCN2 or by the activation of latent TGFβ (Fig. 5). It is interesting to note that, in endothelial cells, TGFβ induces ET-1 expression via Smad and Ap-1 sites in the ET-1 promoter (51Rodriguez-Pascual F. Redondo-Horcajo M. Lamas S. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although TGFβ has been shown to be a key pro-fibrotic cytokine, its action can be amplified or suppressed by several other cytokines (52Leask A. Abraham D.J. FASEB J. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the interactions among these profibrotic and anti-fibrotic cytokines is likely to have a major impact in understanding wound-healing and fibrotic responses in vivo. Thus, further research elucidating the mechanism by which ET-1, TGFβ and CTGF might interact to promote pro-fibrotic responses is of major importance. Because ET-1 is markedly up-regulated during tissue repair (9Shao R. Shi Z. Gotwals P.J. Koteliansky V.E. George J. Rockey D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and in patients with fibrotic disease, these results suggest that ET-1 may play a key role not only in normal wound repair but also in the pathogenesis of fibrosis (10Vancheeswaran R. Magoulas T. Efrat G. Wheeler-Jones C. Olsen I. Penny R. Black C.M. J. Rheumatol. 1994; 21: 1838-1844PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kohan D.E. Am. J.

Rheumatol. 2002; 14: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of circulating ET-1 occurred in patients with skin and lung fibrosis, a finding that correlated with the severity of the fibrotic phenotype (53Yamani K. Miyauchi T. Suzuki N. Yuhara T. Akama T. Suzuki H. Kashiwagi H. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 1566-1571PubMed Google Scholar, 54Kawaguchi Y. Suzuki K. Hara M. Hidaka T. Ishizuka T. Kawagoe M. Nakamura H. Ann. Rheum.

Pathol. 1997; 151: 831-841PubMed Google Scholar). This increase in circulating ET-1 was paralleled by an increase in ET-1 synthesis in vivo (53Yamani K. Miyauchi T. Suzuki N. Yuhara T. Akama T. Suzuki H. Kashiwagi H. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 1566-1571PubMed Google Scholar, 54Kawaguchi Y. Suzuki K. Hara M. Hidaka T. Ishizuka T. Kawagoe M. Nakamura H. Ann. Rheum.

Pathol. 1997; 151: 831-841PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, ET-1 may be an important therapeutic target in the modulation of fibrogenesis. Indeed, our data suggest that ET-1 is a potent fibrogenic peptide for lung fibroblasts, able to induce matrix production by lung fibroblasts via a MEK/ERK-dependent mechanism requiring either the ETA or the ETB receptors (Fig. 5). The results presented in this report are consistent with several studies published recently that have linked the p42/p44 (MEK/ERK) MAP kinase signaling cascade and fibrosis. For example, the TGFβ induction of CCN2 requires the ras/MEK/ERK signaling cascade (47Leask A. Holmes A. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13008-13015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 56Chen Y. Blom I.E. Sa S. Goldschmeding R. Abraham D.J. Leask A.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1949-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the synthetic prostacyclin iloprost, which alleviates symptoms of fibrosis in patients with the fibrotic disease systemic sclerosis (49Stratton R. Shiwen X. Martini G. Holmes A. Leask A. Haberberger T. Martin G.R. Black C.M. Abraham D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), works, at least in part, through the antagonism of the MEK/ERK pathway (57Stratton R. Rajkumar V. Ponticos M. Nichols B. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Leask A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1949-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Collectively, our results suggest that the antagonism of MEK/ERK might be an effective anti-fibrotic approach. In summary, the results presented in our current report emphasize that ET-1 is an important regulator of extracellular matrix biosynthesis by lung fibroblasts and further emphasize the key role of the MEK/ERK cascade in tissue injury and wound healing. Our results further suggest that there may be a potential therapeutic advantage in using MEK/ERK kinase inhibitors or endothelin antagonists to ameliorate the pathological scarring observed in pulmonary fibrosis.

LPS from L. interrogans cells is unusual in that it activates TLR2 rather than TLR4. The structure of L. interrogans lipid A has now been determined by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and biochemical studies. Lipid A was released from LPS of L. interrogans serovar Pomona by 100 °C hydrolysis at pH 4.5 in the presence of SDS. Following purification by anion exchange and thin layer chromatography, the major component was shown to have a molecular weight of 1727. Mild hydrolysis with dilute NaOH reduced this to 1338, consistent with the presence of four N-linked and two O-linked acyl chains. The lipid A molecules of both the virulent and nonvirulent forms of L. interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae (strain Verdun) were identical to those of L. interrogans Pomona by the above criteria. Given the selectivity of L. interrogans LpxA for 3-hydroxylaurate, we propose that L. interrogans lipid A is acylated with R-3-hydroxylaurate at positions 3 and 3′ and with R-3-hydroxypalmitate at positions 2 and 2′. The hydroxyacyl chain composition was validated by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of fatty acid methyl esters.

The 1-position of the disaccharide is derivatized with an axial phosphate moiety, but the 4′-OH is unsubstituted. 1H and 31P NMR analyses revealed that the 1-phosphate group is methylated.

However, numerous studies have shown that leptospiral LPS possesses much lower endotoxic activity than typical Gram-negative LPS (21Adler B. Faine S. Dworkin M. The Prokaryotes.

The latter is the classical signaling receptor of the innate immune system that detects the lipid A moiety of most other Gram-negative LPSs (23Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X.

The recently completed sequencing of the L. interrogans serovar Lai genome strongly supports the idea that these spirochetes synthesize lipid A and LPS, because the genome encodes a complete set of Lpx orthologs and LPS-related glycosyl transferases (13Ren S.X.

L. interrogans lipid A is inactive in the limulus lysate assay and against human THP-1 cells, but it does stimulate mouse macrophage tumor cells with about one-tenth the potency of E. coli lipid A. Our purification and proposed structure for L. interrogans lipid A should facilitate further pharmacological studies. A preliminary communication of our structure has appeared in abstract form (34Que N.L.S. Ramirez S. Werts C. Ribeiro A.A. Bulach D.M. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J.

L. interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae (strain Verdun) was from the Centre de Reference des Leptospires (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Both the virulent and the avirulent variants of the Verdun strain were cultured as described previously (22Werts C. Tapping R.I. Mathison J.C. Chuang T.H. Kravchenko V. Saint Girons I. Haake D.A.

The bacteria were grown in EMJH medium at 30 °C under aerobic conditions to a density of ∼5 × 108 cells/ml (36Ellinghausen H.C. McCulloch W.G. Am. J. Vet.

The preliminary sequence data for T. denticola were obtained from the Baylor College of Medicine (www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu). Purification of LPS—The method described by Westphal and Jann (38Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar) was used to extract LPS from lyophilized cells of L. interrogans serovar Pomona (5 g dry weight) (19Adler B. Ballard S.A. Miller S.J. Faine S. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 1: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). LPS from L. interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae (strain Verdun) was extracted using a modification of the hot phenol-water method (22Werts C. Tapping R.I. Mathison J.C. Chuang T.H. Kravchenko V.

Typically, 1 mg of LPS was recovered from 1012 bacteria. The LPS in the phenol phase was subjected to extensive dialysis against hot water (70 °C). The dialyzed material was clarified twice by low speed centrifugation (3000 × g for 15 min at 10 °C), and the LPS was collected by ultracentrifugation (3 h at 100,000 × g at 10 °C). The pellet was resuspended in endotoxin-free water. The ultracentrifugation step was repeated two or three times until the resuspended LPS showed no absorbance at 260 and 280 nm, after which it was lyophilized and weighed. Because phenol-extracted LPS may retain some impurities that result in TLR2-dependent activation of cells, LPS preparations intended for biological studies are further purified using a procedure that removes LPS-associated proteins (39Manthey C.L.

The purified preparations were stored dry at -20 °C. O-Deacylation of L. interrogans Lipid A by Mild Alkaline Hydrolysis—Complete hydrolysis of all ester-linked fatty acids was achieved by resuspending ∼0.1 mg of pure lipid A in a 1-ml glass vial equipped with a Teflon-lined cap in 120 μl of CHCl3, MeOH, 0.6 m NaOH (2:3:1, v/v/v) and allowing the hydrolysis to proceed at room temperature for 30–60 min. The final mild alkaline hydrolysis mixture was converted into an acidic two-phase Bligh-Dyer system by the addition of 220 μl of CHCl3, 210 μl of MeOH, and 206 μl of 0.1 m HCl. The lower phase was dried with a stream of N2, and the sample was stored at -20 °C. The deacylated lipid A was further purified using a 0.25-ml DEAE-cellulose column, equilibrated, and eluted as above. The O-deacylated lipid A was eluted with CHCl3, MeOH, 30 mm NH4Ac (2:3:1, v/v/v), was recovered by acidic two-phase Bligh-Dyer partitioning, and was stored dry at -20 °C prior. To obtain lipid A that is partially O-deacylated, purified lipid A (∼0.2 mg) was dissolved in 600 μl of CHCl3, MeOH, 0.6 m NaOH (2:3:1, v/v/v). After incubation for only 5 min at room temperature, the solution was converted into an acidic two-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture by the addition of 300 μl of CHCl3, 200 μl of MeOH, and 350 μl of 0.1 m HCl. After mixing, the lower phase was dried with a stream of N2 and stored at -20 °C. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry of L. interrogans Lipid A—Spectra were acquired in the negative ion and the positive ion linear modes using a Kratos Analytical (Manchester, UK) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser, a 20-kV extraction voltage, and time-delayed extraction (42Que N.L.S.

The lipid A samples were prepared for MALDI-TOF analysis by depositing 0.3 μl of the sample dissolved in chloroform, methanol (4:1, v/v), followed by 0.3 μl of the matrix, which was a mixture of saturated 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 50% acetonitrile and 10% tribasic ammonium citrate (9:1, v/v). The sample mixtures were allowed to dry at room temperature. Hexa-acylated lipid A 1,4′-bisphosphate from E. coli (Sigma) set at m/z 1797 was used as an external standard for calibration. Fatty Acid Analysis by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry— Briefly, ∼1 mg of purified L. interrogans lipid A was dissolved in 200 μl of toluene and 400 μl of fresh 1% sulfuric acid in methanol. The sample was then hydrolyzed for 2 h at 100 °C, after which 1 ml of hexane was added. The mixture was mixed for 30 s, followed by centrifugation for ∼10 min at room temperature. The upper phase containing the methyl esters was removed and dried down under a stream of nitrogen. Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed at the University of Minnesota Mass Spectrometry Facility Department of Chemistry using a Finnigan MAT 95 mass spectrometer coupled to a Hewlett-Packard Series II model 5890 gas chromatograph.

Tom1 and its relative Tom1L1 have an N-terminal VHS (Vps27p/Hrs/Stam) domain followed by a GAT (GGA and Tom1) domain, both of which are also found in the GGA (Golgi-localizing, γ-adaptin ear domain homology, ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein) family of proteins. Although the VHS and GAT domains of GGA proteins bind to transmembrane cargo proteins and the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor, respectively, the VHS and GAT domains of Tom1 are unable to interact with these proteins. In this study, we show that the GAT domains of Tom1 and Tom1L1 interact with ubiquitin and Tollip (Toll-interacting protein). Ubiquitin bound the GAT domains of Tom1, Tom1L1, and GGA proteins, whereas Tollip interacted specifically with Tom1 and Tom1L1. Ubiquitin and Tollip bound to an overlapping region of the Tom1-GAT domain in a mutually exclusive manner. Tom1 was predominantly cytosolic when expressed in cells. On the other hand, Tollip was localized on early endosomes and recruited Tom1 and ubiquitinated proteins. These observations suggest that Tollip and Tom1 form a complex and regulate endosomal trafficking of ubiquitinated proteins. Tom1 (target of Myb1) is a protein of unknown function.

Ubiquitin moieties appended to proteins have been implicated in selective protein degradation by the proteasome. However, accumulating lines of evidence have shown more recently that ubiquitination, especially monoubiquitination, is a key signal in the regulation of membrane trafficking and protein degradation in lysosomes (1Hicke L.

In yeast and mammalian cells, ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins such as Ste2p and the epidermal growth factor receptor are endocytosed and sorted into luminal vesicles of the multivesicular body (MVB) 1The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular body; CUE, coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation; Tom1, target of Myb1; VHS, Vps27p/Hrs/Stam; GAT, GGA and Tom1; GGA, Golgi-localizing, γ-adaptin ear domain homology, ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein; ACLL, acidic amino acid cluster-LL (dileucine); ARF, ADP-ribosylation factor; Tollip, Toll-interacting protein; IL-1, interleukin-1; TLR, Toll-like receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Hrs, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate; HA, hemagglutinin; EEA1, early endosomal autoantigen-1; Ub, ubiquitin; TBD, Tom1-binding domain; IRAK-1, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1. for degradation. In yeast, some of the biosynthetic transmembrane cargo proteins have also been shown to be delivered from the Golgi apparatus to the MVB and/or vacuole in a ubiquitination-dependent manner. The ubiquitin signal is recognized by a wide variety of cytosolic adaptor proteins that contain conserved ubiquitin-binding modules such as the UBA (ubiquitin-associated) domain, the CUE (coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation) domain, the ubiquitininteracting motif, the UEV (ubiquitin E2 variant) domain, and the NZF (Npl4 zinc finger) domain (Ref. 4Schnell J.D. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35857-35860Google Scholar and references therein). These adaptor proteins often possess combinations of these modules. Tom1 (target of Myb1) was identified as a protein whose expression is induced by v-Myb (6Burk O. Worpenberg S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1371-1380Google Scholar). Tom1 and its relative Tom1L1 (also referred to as Srcasm) (7Seykora J.T. Mei L. Dotto G.P. Stein P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2812-2822Google Scholar) have an N-terminal VHS (Vps27p/Hrs/Stam) domain followed by a GAT (GGA and Tom1) domain. The C-terminal half is not conserved in Tom1 and Tom1L1. The VHS domain is found in various proteins responsible for endocytic processes and signal transduction and in the GGA (Golgi-localizing, γ-adaptin ear domain homology, ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein) family of proteins (8Lohi O. Poussu A. Mao Y. Quiocho F. Lehto V.-P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 19-23Google Scholar). In the case of GGA proteins, the VHS domain interacts with the ACLL (acidic amino acid cluster-LL (dileucine)) motif found in cargo receptors that cycle between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. The GAT domain is found in GGA proteins, Tom1, and Tom1L1 (9Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguliar R.C. Vargas J.D. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 81-93Google Scholar). The GGA-GAT domain interacts with an active form of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and is responsible for membrane association of GGA proteins (reviewed in Refs. 10Hinners I. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 763-771Google Scholar and 11Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 431-442Google Scholar). In contrast to GGA proteins, the VHS domain of Tom1 or Tom1L1 does not bind to the ACLL motif, and the GAT domain of Tom1 or Tom1L1 does not bind to ARF. To obtain a clue to the functions of Tom1 and Tom1L1, we have carried out a two-hybrid screening with their VHS and GAT domains as baits and found that the GAT domains of both Tom1 and Tom1L1 interact with ubiquitin and Tollip (Toll-interacting protein), which was originally identified by its interaction with the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (12Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Google Scholar) and has a CUE domain (13Ponting C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 527-535Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that Tollip is localized on early endosomes, to which it recruits Tom1 and ubiquitinated proteins. While this manuscript was in preparation, Yamakami et al. (14Yamakami M. Yoshimori T. Yokosawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52865-52872Google Scholar) independently reported that Tom1 can interact with ubiquitinated proteins, Tollip, and clathrin. Our data, together with those of Yamakami et al., suggest that Tollip and Tom1 form a complex and regulate endosomal trafficking of ubiquitinated proteins, which might involve clathrin. Plasmid Construction—The entire coding sequences of human Tom1 and Tom1L1 cDNAs were obtained by PCR amplification of a human liver cDNA library (Invitrogen). cDNA fragments for Tom1 (the VHS+GAT (residues 1-316), VHS (residues 1-152), and GAT (residues 141-316) domains and the C-terminal region (residues 311-492)) and for Tom1L1 (the VHS+GAT (residues 1-303) and GAT (residues 143-303) domains) and for deletions of the Tom1-GAT domain and of human Tollip were obtained by a PCR-based strategy. Mutations of the Tom1-GAT domain resulting in defective ubiquitin binding were introduced into its cDNA using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For expression in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)- or His6/T7-tagged protein, the cDNA fragment was subcloned into pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) or pET-28 (Novagen), respectively. For expression in mammalian cells, the human Tom1, Tollip, or Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) cDNA fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA), His6/FLAG-, or Myc tag sequence (15Shin H.-W. Shinotsuka C. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 525-530Google Scholar). Construction of vectors for GGA-GAT domains was as described previously (16Shiba Y. Katoh Y.

Antibodies—An antiserum was raised in a rabbit against the C-terminal 19-amino acid peptide of human Tom1 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and affinity-purified on a peptide column. The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse monoclonal antibody FK2 (raised against ubiquitin-conjugated proteins; Affiniti Research Products), mouse anti-early endosomal autoantigen-1 (EEA1) monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Diagnostics), rabbit anti-GST polyclonal antibody and mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma), mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen), Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and Cy3-conjugated and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories, Inc.). Two-hybrid Screening—A human brain cDNA library (∼1.1 × 106 clones) was screened using the VHS+GAT domain of Tom1 or Tom1L1 as bait as described previously (16Shiba Y. Katoh Y. Shiba T. Yoshino K. Takatsu H. Kobayashi H. Shin H.-W. Wakatsuki S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7105-7111Google Scholar, 17Takatsu H. Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28541-28545Google Scholar). Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins (∼50 pmol) of the Tom1 domains were purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and incubated with ubiquitin (Ub)-agarose (15 μl) or protein A-agarose (30 μl) beads (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature in buffer A (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 125 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm MgOAc, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100. The beads were then pelleted and washed three times with buffer A. Proteins associated with the beads were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody. The blot was detected with Renaissance Plus chemiluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To examine the GAT interaction with His6/T7-tagged Ub or four tandem ubiquitin units ((Ub)4), the Ub protein was prebound to a Pro-bond nickel chelating resin (Invitrogen) and incubated with GST-GAT (∼50 pmol) for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™ EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics). The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins associated with the beads were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody. To examine the GAT interaction with ubiquitinated proteins, rat liver cytosol (containing 2.5 mg of protein) was incubated with GST fusion proteins (∼20 μg) of the GAT domain pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing Complete™ EDTA-free mixture. Proteins associated with the beads were subjected to immunoblotting with antibody FK2. To examine the Tollip interaction with Tom1-GAT, GST-Tom1-GAT (∼20 μg) prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with lysate from E. coli cells expressing a His6/T7-tagged Tollip fragment (containing ∼250 μg of protein) in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) containing Complete™ for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed five times with buffer B. The materials bound to the beads were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-T7 antibody. In competition experiments, lysates from E. coli cells expressing His6/T7-tagged Tollip-(1-118) and from those expressing His6/T7-tagged (Ub)4 were premixed and incubated with purified GST-Tom1-GAT prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The materials bound to the beads were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-T7 antibody. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—HeLa cells grown on a 6-cm dish were transfected with the FLAG-Tom1 vector alone or in combination with the HA-tagged Tollip construct using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and cultured for 24 h. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing Complete™, and centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant (containing ∼200 μg of protein) was incubated with anti-HA antibody affinity beads (30 μl; Roche Diagnostics) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted and washed three times with lysis buffer. The materials bound to the beads were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody. Immunofluorescence Analysis—DNA transfection and immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells were performed as described previously (16Shiba Y. Katoh Y. Shiba T. Yoshino K. Takatsu H. Kobayashi H. Shin H.-W. Wakatsuki S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7105-7111Google Scholar, 17Takatsu H. Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28541-28545Google Scholar, 18Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Toda K. Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 369-378Google Scholar). Tom1 Interaction with Ubiquitin through the GAT Domain—As described previously (16Shiba Y. Katoh Y. Shiba T. Yoshino K. Takatsu H. Kobayashi H. Shin H.-W. Wakatsuki S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7105-7111Google Scholar), our two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library with the VHS+GAT domain of Tom1 as bait identified six ubiquitin clones. In addition, the same screening identified six Tollip clones (data not shown). Subsequent screening of the same library with the VHS+GAT domain of Tom1L1 identified five clones encoding Tollip, although no ubiquitin clone was obtained (data not shown). When the VHS and GAT domains were separately examined, the latter was found to be responsible for the interactions with both ubiquitin and Tollip (data not shown). The two-hybrid interaction between Tom1 and ubiquitin was at first validated by in vitro pull-down assays. The GAT domain, but not the VHS domain or the remaining C-terminal region, of Tom1 fused to GST was specifically pulled down with Ub-agarose beads (data not shown). We also examined the GAT-ubiquitin interaction using His6/T7-tagged Ub or (Ub)4. In this experiment, the GST-GAT fusion protein was pulled down with His6/T7-tagged Ub or (Ub)4 immobilized on Pro-bond nickel chelating beads. As shown in Fig. 1A, the Tom1-GAT domain was pulled down with both His6/T7-tagged Ub and (Ub)4 with comparable efficiencies. In addition, the GAT domain of Tom1L1 was also pulled down with the His6/T7-tagged Ub constructs. However, this was somewhat surprising for us because no ubiquitin clone was isolated by two-hybrid screening with Tom1L1 as bait and because the GAT domain of Tom1L1 was not pulled down with Ub-agarose beads (data not shown). Conformation or the conjugation state of ubiquitin might affect the interaction. To address this issue, we examined the ability of the GAT domains of Tom1 and Tom1L1 to bind to endogenous ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. To this end, rat liver cytosol was incubated with GST-GAT prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the bound materials were subjected to immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibody FK2, which is able to react with the ubiquitin moiety of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, but not with free ubiquitin (19Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Google Scholar, 20Takada K. Nasu H. Tsukada Y. Ohkawa K. Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 42-47Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B (lane 3), the GAT domain of Tom1 efficiently pulled down ubiquitin-conjugated proteins detectable by antibody FK2, compatible with the data presented by Yamakami et al. (14Yamakami M. Yoshimori T. Yokosawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52865-52872Google Scholar). The Tom1L1-GAT domain also pulled down ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, albeit much less efficiently compared with the Tom1-GAT domain (Fig. 1B, lane 7). X-ray crystallographic studies carried out by us (21Shiba T. Kawasaki M. Takatsu H. Nogi T. Matsugaki N. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Kato R. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 386-393Google Scholar) and by others (22Collins B.M. Watson P.J. Owen D.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 321-332Google Scholar, 23Suer S. Misra S. Saidi L.F. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4451-4456Google Scholar, 24Zhu G. Zhai P. He X. Terzyan S. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6392-6399Google Scholar) have revealed that the GAT domain of GGA1 has an α-helical fold composed of two subdomains. The N-terminal GAT (referred to as N-GAT) subdomain forms a helix-loop-helix structure composed of helix α0 (helix numbering is according to Ref. 21Shiba T. Kawasaki M. Takatsu H. Nogi T. Matsugaki N. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Kato R. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 386-393Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) and an N-terminal half of the long helix (helix α1) and is responsible for binding to the GTP-bound form of ARF (reviewed in Ref. 11Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 431-442Google Scholar). On the other hand, the C-terminal GAT (referred to as C-GAT) subdomain forms a helix bundle composed of the remainder of helix α1 and all of helices α2 and α3 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, our recent study (16Shiba Y. Katoh Y. Shiba T. Yoshino K. Takatsu H. Kobayashi H. Shin H.-W. Wakatsuki S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7105-7111Google Scholar) has shown that, in the case of the GGA3-GAT domain, the C-GAT subdomain, especially Leu276, Leu280, and Asp284 (indicated by red arrowheads in Fig. 2) exposed on one side of helix α3, makes a major contribution to the interaction with the so-called Ile44 patch of ubiquitin. The GAT domains of GGA proteins resemble those of Tom1 and Tom1L1 within the C-GAT subdomain, but not significantly within the N-GAT subdomain (Fig. 2), suggesting that the C-GAT subdomains of Tom1 and Tom1L1 are also responsible for ubiquitin binding. Our mutational experiment supported this expectation; deletion of helix α3 (GATΔC1) (Fig. 1B, lane 4), but not of the N-terminal region (data not shown), of the Tom1-GAT domain abrogated the binding to ubiquitinated proteins. Furthermore, mutations of Leu285 (Fig. 1B, lane 5) and Asp289 (lane 6), which correspond to Leu280 and Asp284, respectively, in GGA3, also abrogated the binding. Interaction between the Tom1-GAT Domain and Tollip—We then focused upon the GAT-Tollip interaction. Tollip interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of the IL-1 receptor and TLRs and regulates their downstream signaling (12Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Google Scholar, 25Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7059-7065Google Scholar, 26Bulut Y. Faure E. Thomas L. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2002; 167: 987-994Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has a CUE domain (see Fig. 8) that can interact with ubiquitin (13Ponting C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 527-535Google Scholar, 27Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Google Scholar). 2Y. Katoh and K. Nakayama, unpublished data. The CUE domain is found in proteins involved in endosomal functions, such as yeast Vps9p (13Ponting C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 527-535Google Scholar, 27Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Google Scholar). We first validated the two-hybrid interaction between the Tom1-GAT domain and Tollip by a pull-down assay. Because a GST fusion protein of full-length Tollip was insoluble in E. coli cells, we divided it into two pieces. The N-terminal half (residues 1-118), but not the C-terminal half containing the CUE domain (residues 117-274), of Tollip pulled down the Tom1-GAT domain (data not shown). Further analysis using a series of deletions indicated that an N-terminal region covering a Gln-rich stretch of Tollip (residues 16-45) (see Fig. 8) was minimally required for the interaction with the Tom1-GAT domain (data not shown), in good agreement with the region determined by Yamakami et al. (14Yamakami M. Yoshimori T. Yokosawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52865-52872Google Scholar). We then examined whether the GAT domain derived from other proteins could also interact with Tollip. As shown in Fig. 3A, Tollip-(1-118) was efficiently pulled down with the GAT domain derived from Tom1L1, but much less efficiently with the GGA-GAT domains.Fig. 3Assays for interaction between Tom1 and Tollip. A: upper panel, a GST fusion protein of the GAT domain from Tom1, Tom1L1, or GGA as indicated was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with lysates from E. coli cells expressing His6/T7-tagged Tollip-(1-118) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The bound materials were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-T7 tag antibody. 10% of the input sample was loaded in the input lane. Lower panel, ∼1 μg of the GST-GAT fusion protein used for the pull-down assay was electrophoresed and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). B: upper panel, a GST fusion protein of wild-type (WT) Tom1-GAT or its mutants as indicated was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with lysates from E. coli cells expressing His6/T7-tagged Tollip-(1-118) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The bound materials were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-T7 tag antibody. 10% of the input sample was loaded in the input lane. Lower panel, ∼1 μg of the GST-GAT fusion protein used for the pull-down assay was electrophoresed and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. C: HeLa cells were transfected with the expression vector for FLAG-tagged Tom1 alone or in combination with HA-tagged Tollip or its deletion mutant lacking the Tom1-binding domain (TollipΔTBD, residues 45-274). Lysates were prepared from these cells and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA antibody-agarose beads. The bound materials were subjected to Western blot (WB) analysis using anti-FLAG (upper panel) or anti-HA (lower panel) antibody. In the lower panel, the asterisk indicates a nonspecific band of an unknown origin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we attempted to delimit the Tollip-interacting region of the Tom1-GAT domain. As shown in Fig. 3B (lane 7), a GAT construct lacking the entire N-GAT subdomain (GATΔN2) (see Fig. 2) retained the ability to interact with Tollip. In contrast, deletion of helix α3 (GATΔC1) (Fig. 3B, lane 4) (see Fig. 2) resulted in an extremely feeble Tollip interaction. These results suggested that the region of the C-GAT subdomain responsible for the interaction with Tollip overlapped with the ubiquitin-binding region (see Fig. 8). However, our data indicated that the interface of the C-GAT subdomain responsible for the Tollip interaction differed from that for ubiquitin binding: the GAT mutants defective in ubiquitin binding, L285R and D289G (Fig. 3B, lanes 8 and 9, respectively), could interact with Tollip with efficiencies comparable with that of the wild-type GAT domain (lane 3). We then examined whether the interactions of the GAT domain with ubiquitin and with Tollip occur simultaneously or in a mutually exclusive manner. To this end, a mixture of a constant amount of Tollip and varying amounts of (Ub)4 or vice versa was incubated with a limited amount of GST-Tom1-GAT immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the proteins bound to the beads were examined. As shown in Fig. 4, as the amount of (Ub)4 added to the mixture was increased, the amount of Tollip bound to the GAT domain decreased (lanes 3-6), and as the amount of Tollip was increased, the amount of (Ub)4 bound to the GAT domain decreased (lanes 7-10). The data indicate that the interactions of Tollip and ubiquitin with the Tom1-GAT domain are mutually exclusive. To examine whether the Tom1-Tollip interaction indeed takes place in the cell, we performed the following experiment. First, FLAG-tagged Tom1 was coexpressed with HA-tagged Tollip or its deletion mutant lacking the Tom1-binding domain (TollipΔTBD, residues 45-274) in HeLa cells. The cell lysates were then precipitated with anti-HA antibody-agarose beads and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 3C, FLAG-Tom1 was coprecipitated with HA-tagged wild-type Tollip, but not with TollipΔTBD, indicating that Tollip specifically interacts with Tom1 through its TBD in the cell. In support of our data, Yamakami et al. (14Yamakami M. Yoshimori T. Yokosawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52865-52872Google Scholar) reported that Tom1 and Tollip form a complex of ∼350 kDa in cell extracts. Tollip Recruits Tom1 onto Endosomes—In an attempt to examine the subcellular localization of Tom1 and Tollip and to further examine the Tom1-Tollip interaction in the cell, we performed immunofluorescence analyses. Although Tollip has been shown to be a negative regulator of signaling downstream of the IL-1 receptor and TLRs (12Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Google Scholar, 25Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7059-7065Google Scholar, 26Bulut Y. Faure E. Thomas L. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2002; 167: 987-994Google Scholar) and to interact with ubiquitin through its CUE domain (27Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Google Scholar), its subcellular localization has not been explored. When expressed in HeLa cells, HA-Tollip was localized on punctate structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). The punctate staining for Tollip significantly, albeit partially overlapped with that for an early endosomal marker, EEA1 (Fig. 6, A, A′, and A″), but not significantly with that for the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (data not shown), which cycles between the trans-Golgi network and late endosomes. These observations suggest that Tollip localizes on part of the population of early endosomes. Because the partial co-localization of EEA1 with Tollip was reminiscent of the partial co-localization of EEA1 with Hrs (28Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Google Scholar, 29Raiborg C. Bache G.K. Mehlum A. Stang E. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5008-5021Google Scholar), which is known to sort ubiquitinated proteins to the MVB/lysosomes by virtue of its ubiquitin-interacting motif (30Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus J.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 394-398Google Scholar), we coexpressed HA-Hrs and Myc-Tollip in HeLa cells and examined their localization. As shown in Fig. 6 (B, B′, and B″), the Tollip-positive structures partially overlapped with the Hrs-positive structures. Thus, a significant portion of Tollip appears to be associated with early endosomes and MVBs.Fig. 6Localization of Tom1 and Tollip on Hrs-positive early endosomal structures. HeLa cells were transfected with the HA-Tollip vector (A, A′, and A″) or cotransfected with the expression vectors for HA-Hrs and Myc-Tollip (B, B′, and B″) and double-stained with anti-HA (A) and anti-EEA1 (A′) antibodies or with anti-Myc (B) and anti-HA (B′) antibodies. Merged images are shown in A″ and B″. In A″, green indicates EEA1, and red indicates HA-Tollip. In B″, green indicates Myc-Tollip, and red indicates HA-Hrs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Tollip mutants lacking the TBD (TollipΔTBD) (Fig. 7D), the CUE domain (TollipΔCUE) (Fig. 7E), and both domains (TollipΔTBD/ΔCUE) (Fig. 7F) all retained the ability to associate with the endosomal structures. These observations indicate that the association of Tollip with endosomes does not depend on its binding to Tom1 or ubiquitin. The C2 domain or another region may determine the endosomal localization, although we did not further explore this issue in this study. On the other hand, Tom1 was predominantly cytoplasmic when expressed alone (Fig. 5B). In striking contrast, Tom1 was completely co-localized with Tollip on the endosome-like structures when these two proteins were coexpressed (Fig. 5, C, C′, and C″). We then raised a polyclonal antiserum against Tom1 to examine the localization of endogenous Tom1. The affinity-purified antiserum could detect a specific, albeit weak band for Tom1 in immunoblot analysis (data not shown). In immunofluorescence analysis, however, the antiserum did not stain distinctive subcellular structures, although faint punctate structures were often observ"
https://openalex.org/W2153200502,"Neurotransmitter receptors are central to communication at synapses. Many components of the machinery for neurotransmission are present prior to synapse formation, suggesting a developmental role. Here, evidence is presented that signaling through glycine receptor alpha2 (GlyRalpha2) and GABA(A) receptors plays a role in photoreceptor development in the vertebrate retina. The signaling is likely mediated by taurine, which is present at high levels throughout the developing central nervous system (CNS). Taurine potentiates the production of rod photoreceptors, and this induction is inhibited by strychnine, an antagonist of glycine receptors, and bicuculline, an antagonist of GABA receptors. Gain-of-function experiments showed that signaling through GlyRalpha2 induced exit from mitosis and an increase in rod photoreceptors. Furthermore, targeted knockdown of GlyRalpha2 decreased the number of photoreceptors while increasing the number of other retinal cell types. These data support a previously undescribed role for these ligand-gated ion channels during the early stages of CNS development."
https://openalex.org/W1976255701,"Voltage-gated sodium channels are members of a large family with similar pore structures. The mechanism of opening and closing is unknown, but structural studies suggest gating via bending of the inner pore helix at a glycine hinge. Here we provide functional evidence for this gating model for the bacterial sodium channel NaChBac. Mutation of glycine 219 to proline, which would strongly favor bending of the α helix, greatly enhances activation by shifting its voltage dependence −51 mV and slowing deactivation by 2000-fold. The mutation also slows voltage-dependent inactivation by 1200-fold. The effects are specific because substitutions of proline at neighboring positions and substitutions of other amino acids at position 219 have much smaller functional effects. Our results fit a model in which concerted bending at glycine 219 in the S6 segments of NaChBac serves as a gating hinge. This gating motion may be conserved in most members of this large ion channel protein family."
https://openalex.org/W2154332704,"Oxygen isotopes in marine sulfate (δ 18 O SO4 ) measured in marine barite show variability over the past 10 million years, including a 5per mil decrease during the Plio-Pleistocene, with near-constant values during the Miocene that are slightly enriched over the modern ocean. A numerical model suggests that sea level fluctuations during Plio-Pleistocene glacial cycles affected the sulfur cycle by reducing the area of continental shelves and increasing the oxidative weathering of pyrite. The data also require that sulfate concentrations were 10 to 20% lower in the late Miocene than today."
https://openalex.org/W1964240133,"Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) is a ubiquitous protein that binds with high affinity to thioredoxin and inhibits its ability to reduce sulfhydryl groups via NADPH oxidation. HcB-19 mice contain a nonsense mutation in Txnip that eliminates its expression. Unlike normal animals, HcB-19 mice have ∼3-fold increase in insulin levels when fasted. The C-peptide/insulin ratio is normal, suggesting that the hyperinsulinemia is due to increased insulin secretion. Fasted HcB-19 mice are hypoglycemic, hypertriglyceridemic, and have higher than normal levels of ketone bodies. Ablation of pancreatic β-cells with streptozotocin completely blocks the fasting-induced hypoglycemia/hypertriglyceridemia, suggesting that these abnormalities are due to excess insulin secretion. This is supported by increased hepatic mRNA levels of the insulin-inducible, lipogenic transcription factor sterol-responsive element-binding protein-1c and two of its targets, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. During a prolonged fast, the hyperinsulinemia up-regulates lipogenesis but fails to down-regulate hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA expression. Hepatic ratios of reduced:oxidized glutathione, established regulators of gluconeogenic/glycolytic/lipogenic enzymes, were elevated 30% in HcB-19 mice, suggesting a loss of Txnip-enhanced sulfhydryl reduction. The altered hepatic enzymatic profiles of HcB-19 mice divert phosphoenolpyruvate to glyceroneogenesis and lipogenesis rather than gluconeogenesis. Our findings implicate Txnip-modulated sulfhydryl redox as a central regulator of insulin secretion in β-cells and regulation of many of the branch-points of gluconeogenesis/glycolysis/lipogenesis. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) is a ubiquitous protein that binds with high affinity to thioredoxin and inhibits its ability to reduce sulfhydryl groups via NADPH oxidation. HcB-19 mice contain a nonsense mutation in Txnip that eliminates its expression. Unlike normal animals, HcB-19 mice have ∼3-fold increase in insulin levels when fasted. The C-peptide/insulin ratio is normal, suggesting that the hyperinsulinemia is due to increased insulin secretion. Fasted HcB-19 mice are hypoglycemic, hypertriglyceridemic, and have higher than normal levels of ketone bodies. Ablation of pancreatic β-cells with streptozotocin completely blocks the fasting-induced hypoglycemia/hypertriglyceridemia, suggesting that these abnormalities are due to excess insulin secretion. This is supported by increased hepatic mRNA levels of the insulin-inducible, lipogenic transcription factor sterol-responsive element-binding protein-1c and two of its targets, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. During a prolonged fast, the hyperinsulinemia up-regulates lipogenesis but fails to down-regulate hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA expression. Hepatic ratios of reduced:oxidized glutathione, established regulators of gluconeogenic/glycolytic/lipogenic enzymes, were elevated 30% in HcB-19 mice, suggesting a loss of Txnip-enhanced sulfhydryl reduction. The altered hepatic enzymatic profiles of HcB-19 mice divert phosphoenolpyruvate to glyceroneogenesis and lipogenesis rather than gluconeogenesis. Our findings implicate Txnip-modulated sulfhydryl redox as a central regulator of insulin secretion in β-cells and regulation of many of the branch-points of gluconeogenesis/glycolysis/lipogenesis. The liver plays a central role in controlling the flow of nutrients to and from peripheral tissues. The flux of carbon units through hepatic pathways of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism are rapidly changed in response to nutrition. In the transition from the fed to the fasted state, hepatocytes switch from being primarily glycolytic and lipogenic to being gluconeogenic and ketogenic. This occurs in response to a drop in blood insulin and to a lesser degree, an increase in glucagon levels. Lipids are exported by the liver in the form of triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) 1The abbreviations used are: VLDL, very low density lipoproteins; SREBP, sterol-responsive element-binding protein; FAS, fatty acid synthase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; FBPase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; Txnip, thioredoxin-interacting protein; STZ, streptozotocin; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate. particles. Depending on the metabolic state, there are two major sources of free fatty acids that are channeled into hepatic triglyceride production. In the fed state, hepatocytes up-regulate the expression of glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes, primarily by increasing the expression and activation of a master regulator, the transcription factor SREBP-1c (1Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Google Scholar). This process converts carbohydrate into fatty acids, which are then esterified to form triglycerides, the major core lipid secreted by the liver as VLDL. In the fasted state, adipose tissue releases free fatty acids from triglyceride stores because insulin levels drop below a threshold required to repress lipolysis and also because of glucagon action. Although the liver does not actively synthesize fatty acids under fasting conditions, it retains the ability to esterify adipose tissue-derived free fatty acids and to export VLDL particles. As much as 50% of fatty acids taken up by the liver during fasting are eventually released as VLDL triglycerides (2Reshef L. Olswang Y. Cassuto H. Blum B. Croniger C.M. Kalhan S.C. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30413-30416Google Scholar). Indeed, in some animal species (e.g. ponies), prolonged fasting leads to hypertriglyceridemia (3Morris M.D. Zilversmit D.B. Hintz H.F. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 383-389Google Scholar). Fasting leads to enhanced gluconeogenesis by the liver. This is largely due to an increase in the expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (4Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Google Scholar), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) (5Pilkis S.J. Claus T.H. Kurland I.J. Lange A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 799-835Google Scholar), and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) (6Chou J.Y. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 25-44Google Scholar). Thus, there is usually an inverse relationship between gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis in the liver (2Reshef L. Olswang Y. Cassuto H. Blum B. Croniger C.M. Kalhan S.C. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30413-30416Google Scholar, 6Chou J.Y. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 25-44Google Scholar, 7Wu C. Okar D.A. Newgard C.B. Lange A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 91-98Google Scholar). Hypertriglyceridemia is one of the most common lipid disorders in the human population. It is usually associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes (8Kissebah A.H. Alfarsi S. Adams P.W. Metabolism. 1981; 30: 856-868Google Scholar, 9Siri P. Candela N. Zhang Y.L. Ko C. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Google Scholar) but is also observed in people without these metabolic disorders (10Brunzell J.D. Albers J.J. Chait A. Grundy S.M. Groszek E. McDonald G.B. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 147-155Google Scholar, 11Ito Y. Azrolan N. O'Connell A. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Science. 1990; 249: 790-793Google Scholar). There is still a dearth of knowledge about the key genes that contribute to hypertriglyceridemia. However, in the majority of cases, excess triglycerides are derived from overproduction rather than defective catabolism of VLDL (8Kissebah A.H. Alfarsi S. Adams P.W. Metabolism. 1981; 30: 856-868Google Scholar, 9Siri P. Candela N. Zhang Y.L. Ko C. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Google Scholar). The HcB-19 mouse is a variant of the C3H strain that was first described as a model of human familial combined hyperlipidemia (12Castellani L.W. Weinreb A. Bodnar J. Goto A.M. Doolittle M. Mehrabian M. Demant P. Lusis A.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 374-377Google Scholar). The gene responsible for the HcB-19 phenotype is thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) (13Bodnar J.S. Chatterjee A. Castellani L.W. Ross D.A. Ohmen J. Cavalcoli J. Wu C. Dains K.M. Catanese J. Chu M. Sheth S.S. Charugundla K. Demant P. West D.B. de Jong P. Lusis A.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 110-116Google Scholar). A nonsense mutation renders the mice Txnip-null, which may enhance the activity of thioredoxin. Thioredoxin plays a role in buffering the redox state of proteins in which the standard redox potential (E°) of their disulfide bonds is within the physiological range (14Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Google Scholar, 15Follmann H. Haberlein I. Biofactors. 1995; 5: 147-156Google Scholar, 16Arrigo A.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 936-944Google Scholar). The HcB-19 mice, therefore, provide a new window into processes that are regulated by a redox rheostat. Animals and Streptozotocin Treatment—HcB-19 and C3H/DiSnA mice derived from the colony at the University of California, Los Angeles (12Castellani L.W. Weinreb A. Bodnar J. Goto A.M. Doolittle M.

Moen C.J. Dietrich W. Stoye J.P. Lander E.S. Demant P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2826-2835Google Scholar) were maintained under standardized conditions and fed with rodent chow 5015 and water ad libitum. The light-cycle hours were between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Streptozotocin (STZ) was injected intraperitoneally (50 mg/kg in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.50) daily for 5 consecutive days. Control animals received the same volume of citrate buffer. Plasma glucose and triglyceride were assessed 21 days after the initial treatment. Plasma Metabolites and Insulin Assays—Blood samples were collected from mice under isofluorane anesthesia in heparinized capillary tubes. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Glucose and triglycerides in plasma were assayed with commercial kits from Sigma. Insulin and C-peptide were assayed using the ultra sensitive rat/mouse insulin RIA kit (Linco) and C-peptide RIA kit (Linco), respectively. Glucose and Galactose Tolerance Tests—Glucose or galactose (3 g/kg of body weight in 0.9% saline) was injected (intraperitoneal) into fasting C3H and HcB-19 mice. Blood samples were collected by retro-orbital bleeding at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min after injection and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Glucose levels in the plasma were assayed with a commercial glucose diagnostic kit from Sigma. Glucose 6-Phosphate (G6P) Phosphohydrolase Assays—Microsomes from overnight-fasted mice were thawed on ice and diluted with ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose solution to 30 ml/g of wet liver weight. The microsomal membrane was disrupted by the addition of 0.2% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. Enzyme assays were carried out in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 20 mm G6P containing 100 μg of microsome protein per 0.75-ml reaction mixture. Incubations were at 30 °C for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Denatured protein was sedimented by centrifugation. Aliquots of the 200-μl supernatant fraction were assayed for inorganic phosphate by a colorimetric kit from Sigma. Measurement of Gluconeogenic Intermediates in the Liver—Animals were starved for 18 h before sacrifice. The livers were immediately removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissue was ground in a porcelain mortar pre-cooled with liquid nitrogen. About 1 g of tissue powder was mixed with 5 ml of 0.6 m perchloric acid and centrifuged. The deproteinized supernatant fraction was removed and adjusted to pH 3.50 with 5 m potassium carbonate. Metabolites were estimated by standard spectrophotometric enzymatic assays as previously described (19Gaja G. Ragnotti G. Cajone F. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Biochem. J. 1968; 109: 867-875Google Scholar, 20Clark M.G. Bloxham D.P. Holland P.C. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 279-290Google Scholar). G6P and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) assays were carried out in 0.2 m triethanolamine buffer containing 0.2 mm NADP-Na2 and 5 mm MgCl2. Glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase was then added, and the production of NADPH was monitored by following the absorbance at 339 nm. The amount of G6P in the samples was calculated from the amount of NADPH generated. After all G6P in the sample has been consumed, phosphoglucose mutase was added to convert F6P to G6P. The amount of F6P in the samples was estimated by the additional production of NADPH. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate were assayed were sequentially in 0.2 m triethanolamine buffer containing 20 mm EDTA and 17 μm NADH. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was then added, and the conversion of NADH to NAD was followed by the change in absorbance at 339 nm. The amount of DHAP in the samples was calculated from the amount of NADH consumed. After the reaction has been completed, triose-phosphate isomerase was added to convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into DHAP. The amount of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the samples was estimated by the additional consumption of NADH. Finally, for the estimation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, aldolase was added to convert fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to DHAP and the change in NADH was measured. Measurement of Glutathione Levels in the Liver—Glutathione levels in the liver were determined spectrophotometrically as described by Anderson (21Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were sacrificed and perfused with ice-cold PBS. Livers were excised and deproteinized with 10 volumes of 5% 5-sulfosalicylic acid. Total glutathione was determined using the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-GSSG reductase recycling assay. The production of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate was followed at 412 nm and is proportional to the amount of total glutathione in the sample. Oxidized glutathione was determined by the same assay after blocking the thiol group of GSH with 2-vinylpyridine. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the livers of mice by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) from 2 μg of total RNA (DNase I-treated) and random hexamer. Real-time PCR was performed in 96-well plates using the Bio-Rad iCycler machine. Typically, the 25-μl reaction contained 12.5 μl of 2xSYBR PCR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad), 1 μl of cDNA, and 125 nm forward and reverse primers. All reactions were done in triplicate and optimized by melt curve analysis to ensure nonspecific products and primer dimers were not formed. The primer sequences used for SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, FAS, ACC, PEPCK, and apoB have been described (1Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Google Scholar, 22Yang J. Goldstein J.L. Hammer R.E. Moon Y.A. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13607-13612Google Scholar). ApoB mRNA was used as the invariant control. The relative amount of mRNA in each sample was determined by the comparative CT method. Statistical Analysis—Results are given as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Loss of Txnip Is Associated with Fasting-induced Hypertriglyceridemia, Hypoglycemia, and Ketosis—As expected, overnight fasting caused triglycerides to decrease 3-fold in control mice (Fig. 1A). In striking contrast, plasma triglycerides increased 4-fold in HcB-19 mice in response to fasting (Fig. 1A). The fasting-induced hypertriglyceridemia uniquely displayed by HcB-19 mice is consistent with previous findings showing that the livers of HcB-19 mice secrete more VLDL particles (12Castellani L.W. Weinreb A. Bodnar J. Goto A.M. Doolittle M. Mehrabian M. Demant P. Lusis A.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 374-377Google Scholar, 13Bodnar J.S. Chatterjee A. Castellani L.W. Ross D.A. Ohmen J. Cavalcoli J. Wu C. Dains K.M. Catanese J. Chu M. Sheth S.S. Charugundla K. Demant P. West D.B. de Jong P. Lusis A.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 110-116Google Scholar). However, the finding that HcB-19 mice showed no hyperlipidemia in the non-fasted state (Fig. 1A) suggests their metabolic disorder is distinct from familial combined hyperlipidemia proposed by earlier reports (12Castellani L.W. Weinreb A. Bodnar J. Goto A.M. Doolittle M. Mehrabian M. Demant P. Lusis A.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 374-377Google Scholar, 13Bodnar J.S. Chatterjee A. Castellani L.W. Ross D.A. Ohmen J. Cavalcoli J. Wu C. Dains K.M. Catanese J. Chu M. Sheth S.S. Charugundla K. Demant P. West D.B. de Jong P. Lusis A.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 110-116Google Scholar). Hepatic VLDL production rapidly adapts to nutritional status (23Davis R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 1-31Google Scholar). Long term fasting is associated with decreased VLDL assembly and secretion (24Davis R.A. Boogaerts J.R. Borchardt R.A. Malone-McNeal M. Archambault-Schexnayder J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14137-14144Google Scholar, 25Leighton J.K. Joyner J. Zamarripa J. Deines M. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1663-1668Google Scholar). The anomalous response to fasting by HcB-19 mice suggests that Txnip plays a role in eliciting the appropriate metabolic response to fasting. Normal mice are able to maintain normal plasma glucose levels during fasting in part by stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis. In contrast to the plasma glucose levels in excess of 100 mg/dl in control mice, HcB-19 mice became hypoglycemic (66.7 mg/dl) after a 14-h fast (Fig. 1B). Consistent with a previous report (12Castellani L.W. Weinreb A. Bodnar J. Goto A.M. Doolittle M. Mehrabian M. Demant P. Lusis A.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 374-377Google Scholar, 13Bodnar J.S. Chatterjee A. Castellani L.W. Ross D.A. Ohmen J. Cavalcoli J. Wu C. Dains K.M. Catanese J. Chu M. Sheth S.S. Charugundla K. Demant P. West D.B. de Jong P. Lusis A.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 110-116Google Scholar), HcB-19 mice also showed a striking 6.6-fold increase in ketone bodies when fasted and a ∼2-fold increase when fed (Fig. 1C). Fasting-induced Hypertriglyceridemia and Hypoglycemia Associated with Loss of Txnip Are Not Caused by Defective Transport or Metabolism of Glucose 6-Phosphate—The fasting-induced hypoglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia phenotype of HcB-19 mice is similar to that of glycogen storage diseases caused by a deficiency in hepatic G6Pase and/or the glucose 6-phosphate transporter in the endoplasmic reticulum (26Lei K.J. Chen H. Pan C.J. Ward J.M. Mosinger Jr., B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Google Scholar, 27Annabi B. Hiraiwa H. Mansfield B.C. Lei K.J. Ubagai T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Moses S.W. Parvari R. Hershkovitz E. Mandel H. Fryman M. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 400-405Google Scholar). Our findings showing that hepatic microsomes from fasted HcB-19 mice contain higher levels of G6Pase activity than those from control mice (Fig. 2A) suggest that impaired G6Pase activity is not responsible for the fasting-induced hypertriglyceridemia, hypoglycemia, or ketosis associated with loss of Txnip. We also determined how loss of Txnip affects the ability of liver in vivo to transport G6P into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and export it as glucose. Galactose is selectively taken up by the liver for conversion to G6P, which can subsequently be used for the production of glucose for secretion into the bloodstream. This process requires an intact function of the G6Pase complex. Thus, the increase in plasma glucose after a bolus of galactose provides an estimation of the relative flux of substrate through G6Pase (28Hawkins R.A. Kamath K.R. Scott H.M. Burchell A. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1995; 18: 558-566Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, injection of a bolus of galactose (3 g/kg of body weight, intraperitoneal) resulted in a similar increment in plasma glucose in both groups of mice. These findings indicate that the fasting-induced hypertriglyceridemia, hypoglycemia, and ketosis associated with loss of Txnip are not caused by defective transport or metabolism of G6P. Fasting-induced Hypertriglyceridemia and Hypoglycemia Associated with Loss of Txnip Are Not Caused by Altered Rates of Removal of Glucose from Plasma—To examine the ability of each group of mice to remove glucose from plasma, fasted mice were challenged with a bolus of glucose (3 g/kg of body weight, intraperitoneal) (Fig. 3). Before glucose administration, HcB-19 mice exhibited lower plasma glucose levels that were ∼50 mg/dl less than those of control mice (Fig. 3). Both groups exhibited similar net increments of plasma glucose as well as similar rates of removal of glucose from plasma after the bolus injection of glucose (Fig. 3). Thus, it appears that the fasting-induced hypoglycemia associated with loss of Txnip is not caused by accelerated removal of glucose from plasma and may be the result of decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis and glucose export. Livers of Fasted HcB-19 Mice Display a Block Near the End Point of Hepatic Gluconeogenesis—To determine whether stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis is impaired in fasting HcB-19 mice, steady-state levels of glycolytic/gluconeogenic intermediates in the livers of fasted mice were measured (Fig. 4). Although the hepatic levels of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-P2) and triose phosphate intermediates (dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) were similar in both groups, levels of G6P and F6P were markedly decreased in HcB-19 mice (>70%, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4). Together with the finding that HcB-19 mice can utilize G6P from galactose for glucose production (Fig. 2B), these data suggest that hypoglycemia is due to a lack of supply of G6P and F6P in the terminal steps of gluconeogenesis. The reduction in G6P and F6P in the fasting HcB-19 livers could be due to decreased FBPase activity. The mRNA and protein levels of FBPase were similar in C3H and HcB-19 mice (Northern and Western blotting, data not shown), suggesting that the change in FBPase activity is due to post-translational modification and/or allosteric control. Loss of Txnip Is Associated with Increased Thiol Redox (GSH/GSSG) Status, an Allosteric Regulator of Gluconeogenesis/Glycolysis—FBPase enzyme activity is negatively regulated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (5Pilkis S.J. Claus T.H. Kurland I.J. Lange A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 799-835Google Scholar). This inhibition is exquisitely dependent upon the thiol (cysteine) redox state of the enzyme, the reduced form being more susceptible to the inhibition by fructose2,6-bisphosphate (29Reyes A. Burgos M.E. Hubert E. Slebe J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8451-8454Google Scholar). Thus, gluconeogenesis and glycolysis are reciprocally responsive to the ratio of reduced glutathione:oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) (30Winiarska K. Drozak J. Wegrzynowicz M. Jagielski A.K. Bryla J. Metabolism. 2003; 52: 739-746Google Scholar). A ∼50% increase in the ratio of GSH/GSSG in renal tubules is associated with an up to 20-fold increased rate of gluconeogenesis (30Winiarska K. Drozak J. Wegrzynowicz M. Jagielski A.K. Bryla J. Metabolism. 2003; 52: 739-746Google Scholar). We, therefore, measured the GSH/GSSG ratio in the livers of both groups of fasted mice. In HcB-19 mice, the hepatic GSH/GSSG ratio was increased by 30% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). The 30% increased GSH/GSSG ratio in the liver displayed by HcB-19 mice is sufficient to account for the apparent block in FBPase observed in the livers of fasted HcB-19 mice (Fig. 4). Loss of Txnip Is Associated with Increased Plasma Levels of Insulin and C-peptide—Because insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis and negatively regulates FBPase activity, we measured the plasma insulin levels in HcB-19 mice. As shown in Fig. 6A, plasma insulin concentrations were significantly elevated in both fed and fasting HcB-19 mice. In the fed state, plasma insulin levels in HcB-19 mice were about 50% higher than that of control. After an 18-h fast, the difference in plasma insulin levels between the 2 groups of mice was ∼3-fold (Fig. 6A). Plasma C-peptide levels in fasted HcB-19 mice also showed a similar ∼3-fold increase (Fig. 6B). These findings suggest that elevated plasma insulin levels in HcB-19 mice are linked to enhanced pancreatic β-cell secretion rather than reduced hepatic insulin clearance. Livers from Fasted HcB-19 Mice Display a Selective Resistance to Hyperinsulinemia—Surprisingly, the hyperinsulinemia displayed by fasted HcB-19 mice was not associated with a detectable increase in the hepatic content of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate or reduced activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (data not shown). Normally, insulin suppresses the expression of PEPCK. However, despite the 3-fold increase in insulin in fasted HcB-19 mice relative to normal mice, PEPCK expression in fasted HcB-19 mice was unchanged (i.e. not suppressed) compared with fasted controls (Table I). Interestingly, fed mice from both groups exhibited decreased expression of PEPCK mRNA and increased expression of lipogenic SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, ACC, and FAS compared with the levels displayed when fasted (Table I).Table IQuantitation of gene expression in C3H and HcB-19 mice by real-time PCR. Livers were obtained at 1000 h (lights on from 0600 to 1800 h) from 12-week-old male C3H and HcB-19 mice that had been fasted for 18 h or were non-fasted. Total RNA and cDNA were prepared from these samples as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression levels of mRNA relative to the constitutively expressed apoB mRNA are indicated and were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Results from four mice in each group are presented as -fold increase relative to that of fasted C3H controls. Statistical differences were determined by Student's t test, and the two-tailed p values are listed.Relative mRNA expression levelsFastedFedC3HHcB-19p value (C3H vs. HcB-19)C3HHcB-19p value (C3H vs. HcB-19)-Fold of increase vs. fasted C3H controlSREBP-1a1.001.620.1831.191.040.790SREBP-1c1.003.280.01211.449.460.308SREBP-21.001.920.0043.282.960.533ACC1.002.000.0054.242.860.116FAS1.002.170.0035.983.300.063PEPCK1.001.050.7110.210.470.040 Open table in a new tab A second physiological function of PEPCK is glyceroneogenesis (2Reshef L. Olswang Y. Cassuto H. Blum B. Croniger C.M. Kalhan S.C. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30413-30416Google Scholar). The hyperlipidemic phenotype of the fasted HcB-19 mice would be consistent with an abnormally increased diversion of PEP toward glycerol production (via glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and lipogenesis (31Steinberg D. Vaughan M. Margolis S. Price H. Pittman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1631-1637Google Scholar, 32Spiegelman B.M. Green H. Cell. 1981; 24: 503-510Google Scholar). Consistent with increased lipogenesis, SREBP-1c levels in the fasted HcB-19 mice were 3.3-fold higher than those of control mice (Table I). As expected, the expression of SREBP-1c target genes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase were also increased 2-fold in fasted HcB-19 mice (Table I). Because the changes in lipogenesis correlate with hyperinsulinemia, we ablated the insulin-producing β-cells of the normal and HcB-19 mice with STZ. In addition to the expected hyperglycemia associated with loss of insulin signaling, STZ treatment completely blocked the fasting-induced hypertriglyceridemia in the HcB-19 mice (Fig. 7). Thus, the fasting-induced hypertriglyceridemia of the HcB-19 mice is dependent upon insulin. Animals are able to reprogram their metabolic pathways to adapt to changes in nutrient availability, hormonal status, and energy demands. The mechanisms require sensing these stimuli and bringing about a change in the abundance or activation state of metabolic enzymes and regulators of gene expression. A recurring theme in metabolism is that cells sense their “energy charge” by responding to changes in ATP or AMP or to changes in “redox potential” as reflected in NAD(P)H/NAD+(P) and GSH/GSSG. The cysteine residues of many proteins exist in a dynamic state between the reduced free sulfhydryl and the oxidized disulfide bridge. There are many in vivo processes that allow redox potential to equilibrate NAD(P)H/NAD+(P), GSH/GSSG, and protein sulfhydryl reduction/oxidation. The ubiquitous enzyme thioredoxin is mainly responsible for equilibrating NAD(P)H/NAD+(P) redox potential with protein sulfhydryl redox state via the oxidation of NADPH (33Sen C.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 1-30Google Scholar, 34Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Google Scholar, 35Tanaka T. Nakamura H. Nishiyama A. Hosoi F. Masutani H. Wada H. Yodoi J. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 33: 851-855Google Scholar). Thioredoxin function can itself be modulated by its interaction with its inhibitory protein partner, Txnip (36Nishiyama A. Matsui M. Iwata S.

IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 29-33Google Scholar). The availability of a Txnip-null mutant mouse (13Bodnar J.S. Chatterjee A. Castellani L.W. Ross D.A. Ohmen J. Cavalcoli J. Wu C. Dains K.M. Catanese J. Chu M. Sheth S.S. Charugundla K. Demant P. West D.B. de Jong P. Lusis A.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 110-116Google Scholar) provided an opportunity to discover the metabolic pathways that are affected by the loss of Txnip. This study establishes a causal connection between loss of Txnip resulting in enhanced sulfhydryl reduction and dysregulated carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The work suggests that Txnip plays a role in at least two tissue sites, the liver and pancreatic β-cells. To maintain homeostasis the liver must balance the flux of carbon units into gluconeogenesis with metabolic needs by sensing blood glucose and integrating this information with energy stores and redox state. Glucose sensing occurs both directly and through insulin. The discovery that SREBP-1c is an insulin target explained how hepatocytes modify the expression of enzymes in glycolysis and lipogenesis appropriate to the level of blood glucose (1Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Google Scholar, 38Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Google Scholar, 39Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Google Scholar). In addition to blood glucose, cells respond to their own internal energy status. Fasting is associated with a more oxidized sulfhydryl redox state (40Isaacs J. Binkley F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 497: 192-204Google Scholar). Our results establish a connection between redox status, Txnip, and metabolic adaptation to fasting. Instead of becoming more glucogenic, the fasting liver of a Txnip-null mouse is lipogenic. The dearth of glucose leads to hypoglycemia and ketosis. The fasted HcB-19 mice are hyperinsulinemic. Yet, they fail to suppress the expression of PEPCK. Together with the induction of SREBP-1c and its regulated genes, this presents a picture of selective insulin resistance analogous to those previously reported by Shimomura and co-workers (41Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Google Scholar) in lipodystrophic mice. PEPCK catalyzes the formation of PEP, a precursor for both glucose and glycerol production. In fasted HcB-19 mice, PEP is selectively channeled into glyceroneogenesis due to the block in FBPase (Fig. 4) and the increased demand for triglyceride synthesis caused by increased plasma levels of fatty acids observed in HcB-19 mice (12Castellani L.W.

Genet. 2002; 30: 110-116Google Scholar) returning to the liver and increased hepatic synthesis due to increased expression of ACC and FAS (Table I). Sulfhydryl redox state, as reflected by the ratio of cellular GSH/GSSG, reciprocally regulates enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis (for review, see Ref. 42Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 330-351Google Scholar) such as hepatic FBPase (gluconeogenesis) (43Pontremoli S. Luppis B. Traniello S. Rippa M. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1965; 112: 7-15Google Scholar) and phosphofructokinase (glycolysis) (44Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12086-12091Google Scholar). In addition, sulfhydryl redox state also modulates the activity of enzymes involved in fatty acid and glycerolipid biosynthesis such as ATP-citrate lyase (45Cottam G.L. Srere P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 35: 895-900Google Scholar, 46Osterlund B.R. Packer M.K. Bridger W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 205: 489-498Google Scholar), FAS (47Walters D.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13135-13143Google Scholar), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (48Cho Y.W. Kim D. Park E.H. Lim C.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 13: 315-321Google Scholar), and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (49Jamdar S.C. Soo E. Cao W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 41-48Google Scholar) (summarized in Fig. 8). The findings showing that GSH in the livers of fasted HcB-19 mice is 30% more reduced (Fig. 5) may explain the decreased flux of carbon units through FBPase and increased production of fatty acids and glycerolipids. As a result, carbon units are secreted as triglycerides as a component of VLDL (12Castellani L.W. Weinreb A. Bodnar J. Goto A.M. Doolittle M. Mehrabian M. Demant P. Lusis A.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 374-377Google Scholar, 13Bodnar J.S. Chatterjee A. Castellani L.W. Ross D.A. Ohmen J. Cavalcoli J. Wu C. Dains K.M. Catanese J. Chu M. Sheth S.S. Charugundla K. Demant P. West D.B. de Jong P. Lusis A.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 110-116Google Scholar). The data showing increased hepatic content of mRNAs encoding the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1c and two of its transcriptional targets (ACC and FAS) (Table I) in fasted HcB-19 mice provides an additional mechanism through which insulin enhances the flow of carbon units from glucose export into hepatic VLDL secretion. Our findings suggest a role for Txnip in the pancreatic β-cells. The increased insulin secretion in fasted HcB-19 mice could be due to increased secretion by individual β-cells or increased β-cells mass. We suspect the latter is more likely. Txnip has been shown to block the thioredoxin-sulfhydryl reduction by NADPH (36Nishiyama A. Matsui M. Iwata S. Hirota K. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Takagi Y. Sono H. Gon Y. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21645-21650Google Scholar). This finding predicts that the absence of Txnip in HcB-19 mice would lead to increased thioredoxin reduction activity (50Junn E. Han S.H. Im J.Y. Yang Y. Cho E.W. Um H.D. Kim D.K. Lee K.W. Han P.L. Rhee S.G. Choi I. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6287-6295Google Scholar). Pancreatic β-cells contain abundant levels of thioredoxin (51Hotta M. Tashiro F. Ikegami H. Niwa H. Ogihara T. Yodoi J. Miyazaki J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1445-1451Google Scholar), which may contribute to the intracellular processing and secretion of insulin (52Taljedal I.B. Diabetologia. 1981; 21: 1-17Google Scholar). It is believed that thioredoxin facilitates the processing and maturation of insulin (36Nishiyama A. Matsui M. Iwata S. Hirota K. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Takagi Y. Sono H. Gon Y. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21645-21650Google Scholar) and, thus, may prevent unfolded protein response-induced apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells (53Ron D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 443-445Google Scholar, 54Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Google Scholar). Transgenic overexpression of thioredoxin in pancreatic β-cells protects mice from STZ-induced and autoimmune diabetes (51Hotta M. Tashiro F. Ikegami H. Niwa H. Ogihara T. Yodoi J. Miyazaki J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1445-1451Google Scholar). Txnip-thioredoxin interactions may be an effective target for promoting insulin secretion without causing pancreatic β-cell apoptosis. Glucose causes a large increase in Txnip expression in pancreatic β-cells (55Shalev A. Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Hoffmann S.C. Hirshberg B. Brady J.N. Harlan D.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3695-3698Google Scholar) and in cultured fibroblasts (56Hirota T. Okano T. Kokame K. Shirotani-Ikejima H. Miyata T. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44244-44251Google Scholar). This response links nutritional state (e.g. glucose uptake) with redox state and subsequent metabolic regulation. Our findings further suggest that the cellular redox state provides a unifying parameter linking cellular response to nutritional state. This response is tuned via Txnip-mediated changes in sulfhydryl redox potential."
https://openalex.org/W2044021223,"Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) can be sensitized to odorants by repeated exposure, suggesting that an animal's responsiveness to olfactory cues can be enhanced at the initial stage of detection. However, because OSNs undergo a regular cycle of apoptosis and replacement by ostensibly naive, precursor-derived neurons, the advantage of sensitization would be lost in the absence of a mechanism for odorant-enhanced survival of OSNs. Using recombinant adenoviruses in conjunction with surgical and electrophysiological techniques, we monitored OSN survival and function in vivo and find that odorant exposure selectively rescues populations of OSNs from apoptosis. We further demonstrate that odorant stimuli rescue OSNs in a cAMP-dependent manner by activating the MAPK/CREB-dependent transcriptional pathway, possibly as a result of expression of Bcl-2."
https://openalex.org/W2037451129,"Synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) has been involved in the correct delivery and clustering of glutamate ionotropic receptors to the postsynaptic compartment. Here we demonstrate that synaptic trafficking of SAP97 itself was modulated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in cultured hippocampal neurons. CaMKII activation led to increased targeting of SAP97 into dendritic spines, whereas CaMKII inhibition was responsible for SAP97 high colocalization in the cell soma with the endoplasmic reticulum protein disulfide-isomerase. No effect was detected for other members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family, such as SAP102 and PSD-95. Transfection of activated αCaMKII T286D dramatically increased concentration of both endogenous and transfected SAP97 at postsynaptic terminals. In vitro CaMKII phosphorylation of the SAP97 N-terminal fusion protein and metabolic labeling of transfected COS7 cells indicated SAP97-Ser-39 as a CaMKII phosphosite in the SAP97 protein sequence. Moreover, transfection in hippocampal neurons of SAP97 mutants that blocked or mimicked Ser-39 phosphorylation had effects similar to those observed upon inhibiting or constitutively activating CaMKII. Further, CaMKII-dependent SAP97-Ser-39 phosphorylation determined a redistribution of the glutamate receptor subunit (GluR1) of the AMPA receptor. In conclusion, our data show that CaMKII-dependent SAP97-Ser-39 phosphorylation regulates the association of SAP97 with the postsynaptic complex, thus providing a fine molecular mechanism responsible for the synaptic delivery of SAP97 interacting proteins, i.e. ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits.

Among molecular associations regulating subcellular targeting of iGluRs subunits, interaction with members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family has been proposed (1Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In fact, MAGUK protein family members have been addressed as organizing elements in excitatory neurons (2Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). MAGUKs are characterized by a common multimodular structure including three PDZ domains, a Src homology domain 3, and a guanylate kinase-like domain. Members of this family act as molecular scaffolds for iGluRs mainly by direct interaction with an SXV motif on the cytoplasmic termini of their binding proteins. Recently, members of this family have been proposed to be involved in iGluRs trafficking (3Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Among MAGUKs, SAP97 is the rat homologue of the Drosophila (Dlg) and human (hDlg) discs large tumor suppressor protein. In the mammalian central nervous system, SAP97 has been described as enriched both at pre- and postsynaptic compartments, where it has been implicated in the processing of the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor (4Rumbaugh G. Sia G.M. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4567-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an interaction with NR2-type NMDA subunits has been put forward (5Bassand P. Bernard A. Rafiki A. Gayet D. Khrestchatisky M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2031-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SAP97 interacts with GluR1 early in the biosynthetic pathway of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors (7Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 8Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), confirming that PDZ protein interactions at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum-cis-Golgi play an important part in the distribution and surface expression of ion channels in neurons. In contrast, few synaptic AMPA receptors associate with SAP97 (8Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that SAP97 dissociates from the receptor complex at the plasma membrane. These data imply the existence of a fine-tuning of iGluRs interactions with SAP97 mediated by a still unknown partner. Recently, different members of MAGUK have been identified as possible new targets for CaMKII (6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Koh Y.H. Popov E. Thomas U. Griffith L.C. Budnik V.

Commun. 2002; 290: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of a new mechanism regulating MAGUK function in the postsynaptic neuron. In fact, although several CaMKII substrates have been identified in the last few years (10Yoshimura Y. Shinkawa T. Taoka M. Kobayashi K. Isobe T. Yamauchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), little is known about the functional role of specific CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation processes that take place in vivo in the postsynaptic compartment. Recently, studies from our group (6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) showed that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-232 within the PDZ1 domain disrupts SAP97 interaction with NR2A, thereby regulating synaptic targeting of this NMDA receptor subunit. Here we show that CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of an additional SAP97 site, Ser-39, within the L27 domain is necessary and sufficient to drive SAP97 to the postsynaptic compartment in cultured hippocampal neurons. In addition, SAP97-Ser-39 phosphorylation represents a key step governing GluR1-containing AMPA receptor delivery to the postsynaptic complex, thus suggesting SAP97 as a multimodular element where distinct domains play differential roles in organizing the glutamatergic synapse. Neuronal Cultures, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence Labeling—Low density or high density hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from E18-E19 rat hippocampi as previously described, with minor modifications (11Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). Neurons were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method at 10 days in vitro. Mutated products were obtained by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hippocampal neurons were fixed in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 15 min. Transfected cells were used 4 days after transfection. Primary and secondary antibodies were applied in GDB buffer (30 mm phosphate buffer (pH7.4) containing 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.8 m NaCl). Fluorescence images were acquired using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope. Pharmacological agents were used at the following concentrations: 50 μm NMDA (Sigma), 10 mm caffeine (Sigma), 1 μm thapsigargin (Tocris, Bristol, UK), 10 μm Ant-AIP-2 (Calbiochem), 10 μm KN-93 (Sigma), 10 μm ryanodine (Sigma), 100 μm APV (Sigma), 10 μm H89 (Sigma), 1 μm PP2 (Calbiochem), 0.1 μm GF109203X (Calbiochem). TIF Preparation—Triton-insoluble fractions (TIF) were isolated from neurons harvested at 10-14 DIV as previously described (6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling—COS-7 cells were transfected with empty vector, GFP-SAP97wt + αCaMKII-T286D, GFP-SAP97(S39A,S232A) + αCaMKII-T286D, or GFP-SAP97(S39A) + αCaMKII-T286D. 48 h after transfection, cells were preincubated for 2 h in phosphate-free minimal essential medium. The medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh phosphate-free minimal essential medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (500 μCi/ml). After 2 h, okadaic acid 0.2 μm was added to the medium and cells were incubated for an additional hour. Cells were harvested into 0.5 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer containing a complete set of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM; Roche Diagnostics). Each solubilized sample was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-SAP97 polyclonal antibody. Protein A-Sepharose beads washed in the same buffer were added and incubation continued for 2 h. Western blots were performed on all immunoprecipitated samples to verify that equal amounts of SAP97 protein were being precipitated under all conditions. Image Acquisition and Quantification—Confocal images were obtained using a Nikon ×60 objective with sequential acquisition setting at 1024 × 1024 pixels resolution. Each image was a z series projection of ∼8-12 images taken at 0.5-1-μm depth intervals. Pharmacologically treated and transfected neurons were chosen randomly for quantification from two to five coverslips from three to five independent experiments for each construct. Quantification of confocal experiments was performed using Bio-Rad Laserpix software. Both image acquisition and quantification of the fluorescence signal were performed by investigators who were “blind” to the experimental condition. Quantification of Western blot analysis and autoradiography was performed by means of computer-assisted imaging (Quantity-OneR System; Bio-Rad), and statistical evaluations were performed according to one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni as a post hoc comparison test. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of GST Fusion Protein—SAP97 fragments were subcloned downstream of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the BaMHI and HindIII sites of the expression plasmid pGEX-KG by PCR using plaque-forming unit polymerase (Promega). The inserts were fully sequenced with the ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (ABI Prisma). SAP97·GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), and eluted as previously described (12Gardoni F. Schrama L.H. van Dalen J.J.W. Gispen W.H. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Fusion Protein Phosphorylation—GST·SAP97 purified fusion proteins were incubated with αCaMKII (1-325) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 37 °C in the presence of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 2.4 μm calmodulin, 2 mm CaCl2 with 100 μm ATP ([γ-32P]ATP, 2 μCi/tube, 3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was initiated by the addition of kinase solution to the reaction mixture. The reaction was carried out for 5 min and stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Surface Expression Assays—Chymotrypsin (Sigma) treatments and cross-linking experiments by means of BS3 (Pierce) were performed as previously described (13Hall R.A. Soderling T.R. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: mouse αCaMKII antibody and polyclonal GluR1 antibody were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc., (Temecula, CA); polyclonal SAP97 antibody, polyclonal SAP102 antibody, monoclonal PSD-95 antibody, and monoclonal protein disulfide-isomerase (DSI) antibody were purchased from Affinity BioReagents Inc. (Golden, CO); monoclonal SAP97 antibody was purchased from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada); polyclonal anti-GFP and AlexaFluor 488, 555, 568, and 633 secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Differential Distribution of MAGUK Family Members in Hippocampal Neurons—We examined by confocal labeling the distribution pattern of SAP97 and SAP102 in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1, A-J); PSD-95 was used as a marker of postsynaptic structures. SAP97 displayed a diffuse labeling in the somatic cytoplasm; immunoreactivity was also present in dendrites where both diffuse and punctate staining are present. A moderate colocalization pattern with PSD-95 was observed, indicating the presence of endogenous SAP97 at the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses (Fig. 1, A-D). SAP102 labeling revealed a more intense staining in the soma than in the dendrites (Fig. 1E). No punctate SAP102 labeling and colocalization with PSD-95 were detectable, suggesting the absence of SAP102 in dendritic spines. Neuronal activation by means of 15 min of treatment with NMDA (50 μm) led to an increased punctate staining of SAP97 in the dendritic compartment, leading to a higher colocalization degree with PSD-95 (Fig. 1, F-I). Quantification of SAP97 punctate staining revealed a significative increase of SAP97 immunoreactivity in PSD-95-positive dendritic spines (Fig. 1K; *, p <0.01, NMDA versus control). On the other hand, no modification of SAP102 immunostaining was induced by NMDA treatment (Fig. 1J). To confirm that endogenous SAP97 was expressed in the postsynaptic compartment of cultured neurons and to confirm its trafficking after NMDA treatment, a biochemical approach was also used. TIF was obtained from control and NMDA-treated neurons (see Ref. 6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and protein levels measured in the homogenate and TIF. The same amount of proteins from homogenate and TIF was loaded on the SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1L, SAP97 is barely detectable in TIF in untreated neurons; NMDA treatment, confirming confocal experiments, significantly increases SAP97 immunostaining in TIF without affecting the total SAP97 protein level in the homogenate (*, p <0.01; +57.2 ± 8.1%, NMDA versus control expressed as SAP97 ratio TIF/homogenate). No alteration of PSD-95 immunostaining in both homogenate and TIF was observed after NMDA treatment. No SAP102 signal was present in TIF. As expected, treatment of hippocampal cultures with NMDA leads to a higher staining of αCaMKII in TIF (14Shen K. Meyer T. Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). CaMKII Inhibition Affects SAP97 Distribution in Hippocampal Neurons—Previous data from our laboratory demonstrated that NMDA exposure, leading to a maximal CaMKII activation, produced an in vivo SAP97 phosphorylation in cultured hippocampal neurons; CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 reduced SAP97 phosphorylation to basal levels, indicating a key role for this kinase in SAP97 phosphorylation (6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These data and other recent evidence (10Yoshimura Y. Shinkawa T. Taoka M. Kobayashi K. Isobe T. Yamauchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) identified SAP97 as substrate for CaMKII. These observations led us to test whether CaMKII-dependent SAP97 phosphorylation is involved in SAP97 trafficking from intracellular compartments into dendritic shafts and spines. To this purpose, hippocampal cultures were exposed to NMDA in the absence or presence of specific CaMKII inhibitors. Two different strategies have been used to inhibit CaMKII: i) incubation with the competitive inhibitor KN-93, and ii) with the autoinhibitory peptide (AIP-2) fused to the antennapedia peptide (Ant). Both KN-93 (Fig. 2, D-F) and Ant-AIP-2 (Fig. 2, G-I) were able to modify SAP97 distribution, leading to a higher immunoreactivity of SAP97 within the soma and to a parallel decrease of SAP97 staining in the proximal and distal dendrites when compared with untreated neurons (Fig. 2, A-C). Quantification of the dendritic versus cell soma SAP97 immunostaining by measuring the relative fluorescence intensity revealed a significative decrease of SAP97 fluorescent signal in dendritic structures as a consequence of CaMKII inhibition (Fig. 2N; *, p <0.001 KN-93 versus control, **, p <0.0005 Ant-AIP-2 versus controls). In addition, colocalization between SAP97 and PSD-95 was lost because the SAP97 punctate signal in dendritic spines was absent. NMDA treatment was not able to counteract the effect of CaMKII inhibitors on SAP97 localization (Fig. 2, J-N, **, p <0.0005, NMDA + Ant-AIP-2 versus control). Moreover, the CaMKII-dependent effect on SAP97 localization was specific for this member of the MAGUK protein family because other members of the family such as PSD-95 (Fig. 2, B, E, H, and K) and SAP102 (Fig. 2M) were not affected. In fact, no alterations of PSD-95 punctate staining and SAP102 somatodendritic pattern were induced by CaMKII inhibitors. As described above (see Fig. 1L), a biochemical approach was again used to confirm modulation of SAP97 distribution by CaMKII inhibitors: co-treatment of Ant-AIP-2 + NMDA, confirming confocal experiments, significantly decreases SAP97 immunostaining in TIF (Fig. 2O; *, p <0.005, +97.2 ± 6.7%, NMDA versus control; *, p <0.01, -44.5 ± 4.5%, NMDA + Ant-AIP-2 versus control) without affecting PSD-95 immunostaining. To confirm that SAP97 trafficking in hippocampal neurons was specifically modulated by CaMKII, tyrosine kinases (1 μm, PP2), PKA (10 μm, H89), and PKC (0.1 μm, GF109203X) inhibitors were used. SAP97 staining in the presence of all these inhibitors was comparable with SAP97 immunoreactivity observed in control neurons (data not shown). Because in control untreated neurons a pronounced SAP97 intracellular staining in the cell soma was observed, we performed colocalization experiments with an endoplasmic reticulum-specific marker, protein disulfide-isomerase; SAP97 showed a good colocalization with DSI in untreated cultures (Fig. 3, A-C; see Ref. 4Rumbaugh G. Sia G.M. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4567-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NMDA treatment led to a decreased colocalization between SAP97 and the ER marker in the cell soma (Fig. 3, D-F). Of relevance, coincubation with CaMKII inhibitor Ant-AIP-2 determined a high colocalization degree between SAP97 and the ER marker, DSI (Fig. 3, G-I). It has been shown that calcium-induced calcium release from ER, usually associated to activation of ryanodine receptors (RyRs), is triggered by entry of calcium through NMDA receptor channels (15Emptage N. Bliss T.V. Fine A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Because it is known that CaMKII can be associated to RyRs (16Kouzu Y. Moriya T. Takeshima H. Yoshioka T. Shibata S. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 76: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Currie S. Loughrey C.M. Craig M.A. Smith G.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we tested whether CaMKII-dependent modulation of SAP97 trafficking was correlated to activation of RyRs by examining the distribution pattern of SAP97 in neurons exposed to caffeine (Fig. 4). Caffeine treatment induced SAP97 trafficking to “spine-like” structures (as confirmed by double labeling of neurons with the postsynaptic protein marker PSD-95; data not shown), both in the absence and the presence of d-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (Fig. 4A). In addition, RyRs blocking with high concentrations of ryanodine antagonized the effects of NMDA on SAP97 distribution (Fig. 4A), suggesting that calcium-induced calcium release from RyRs is necessary to trigger SAP97 trafficking. No effect on SAP102 immunostaining was observed as a consequence of the treatments indicated above acting on ER stores (data not shown). Also under these experimental conditions, coincubation of CaMKII inhibitor Ant-AIP-2 was able to block any effect of caffeine on SAP97 trafficking as tested both by confocal analysis (Fig. 4C; *, p <0.0005 caffeine versus control, **, p <0.001 caffeine + Ant-AIP-2 versus control expressed as the ratio of dendrites to cell soma average fluorescence) and by Western blotting in the TIF (Fig 4D; *, p <0.01, +67.0 ± 8.3%, caffeine versus control; *, p <0.005, -69.5 ± 4.3%, caffeine + Ant-AIP-2 versus control), confirming the central role of CaMKII in these events. CaMKII-dependent Phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-39 Affects SAP97 Trafficking into Spines—Modulation of SAP97 trafficking by CaMKII was further studied in hippocampal neurons cotransfected with GFP-SAP97wt and αCaMKIIwt or active-T286D αCaMKII (Fig. 5A). Four days after transfection, neurons were fixed and confocal analysis was performed. Cotransfection of GFP-SAP97 with αCaMKIIwt did not alter the characteristic GFP-SAP97 somatodendritic distribution (see Figs. 5A and 7A). However, cotransfection with active-T286D αCaMKII led to a GFP-SAP97 punctate staining with a concomitant reduction of immunoreactivity in the cell body and dendrites (Fig. 5A). In addition, single αCaMKIIwt or active-T286D αCaMKII transfections had similar effects on endogenous SAP97 (Fig. 5B). Several CaMKII phosphorylation consensus domains are distributed along the SAP97 sequence (6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Koh Y.H. Popov E. Thomas U. Griffith L.C. Budnik V. Cell. 1999; 98: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Previous data from our laboratory addressed Ser-232 within the PDZ1 domain as a CaMKII in vivo phosphorylation site in SAP97. CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of this site is responsible for the dynamic modulation of SAP97-NR2A complex (6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Inspection of the SAP97 sequence reveals the presence of another domain containing a serine residue (Ser-39 in the L27 N-terminal domain) that could represent a putative phosphate acceptor site for CaMKII (Fig. 6A). A fusion protein of GST with the N-terminal SAP97 (7-223) domain was obtained and incubated with recombinant αCaMKII (1-325) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as phosphate donor. Fig. 6B is a representative autoradiograph of an in vitro CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of the SAP97 (7-223) GST fusion protein; a radioactive band at about 50 kDa corresponding to the fusion protein (upper arrow) is clearly visible, confirming the presence of the CaMKII phosphosites in the N-terminal domain of SAP97 (right lane). The phosphorylation signal is specific because GST alone did not show any phosphoband (left lane). The 37-kDa phosphoband corresponding to autophosphorylated αCaMKII (1-325) was also detectable (lower arrow). We then tested whether SAP97-Ser-39 was in vivo phosphorylated by CaMKII. GFP, GFP-SAP97wt, GFP-SAP97(S39A), or GFP-SAP97(S39A,S232A) were cotransfected in COS-7 cells together with αCaMKII-T286D. 48 h after transfection, we performed metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-SAP97 antibody. Autoradiography revealed a significative reduction of 32P incorporation in SAP97(S39A)-transfected cells when compared with SAP97wt, indicating that Ser-39 represents a phosphorylation site in SAP97 under these experimental conditions (Fig. 6C, upper panel, -41.8% ± 6.3%, SAP97(S39A) versus SAP97wt, *, p <0.01). S39A,S232A mutation decreased CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation to barely detectable levels, indicating Ser-39 and Ser-232 (6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as the two major in vivo CaMKII phosphosites in SAP97. Expression levels of all SAP97 constructs were comparable in all experimental conditions as tested by Western blotting using a polyclonal SAP97 antibody (Fig. 6C, lower panel). To further investigate the molecular mechanism governing CaMKII-dependent trafficking of SAP97, we examined the spatial localization of transfected SAP97 constructs in hippocampal neurons, carrying point mutation into the previously identified CaMKII consensus sites (Fig. 7A). Single SAP97(S232D) mutation, mimicking phosphorylation, did not produce any significative effect on SAP97 localization in dendritic spines when compared with the wild type protein, suggesting that CaMKII phosphorylation of this site is not involved in SAP97 trafficking but only in the modulation of SAP97 interaction with NR2A as previously described (6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with the SAP97(S39A construct), whereas the SAP97(S39D) mutation led to an increased staining of SAP97 into “spine-like” structures (as confirmed by double labeling of neurons with the postsynaptic protein marker PSD-95; data not shown). Quantification analysis of the different SAP97 mutation constructs revealed a significative increase of spine-like clusters in SAP97(S39D)-transfected neurons compared with all other constructs (Fig. 7B). Colocalization experiments performed with synaptophysin indicated a specific postsynaptic immunoreactivity of SAP97(S39D) constructs in close opposition to the characteristic presynaptic synaptophysin staining (Fig. 7C). Moreover, double transfection of SAP97(S39A) + active-T286D αCaMKII showed that abrogation of the Ser-39 phosphosite is sufficient to block any effect of the active form of the kinase on SAP97 enrichment in punctate structures (Fig. 7D and see also Fig. 4A). Abrogation of SAP97-Ser-39 Phosphosite Impairs AMPA Receptor Subunit GluR1 Spine Delivery—SAP97 has been shown to associate to the C-terminal PDZ binding domain of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits in neurons (7Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). More recently, synaptic targeting of SAP97 has been demonstrated to lead to an increase in synaptic AMPA receptors, spine enlargement, and an increase in miniature excitatory post-synaptic current frequency (4Rumbaugh G. Sia G.M. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4567-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that SAP97 can affect the synaptic recruitment of AMPA receptors. We therefore asked whether the effect of CaMKII-dependent trafficking of endogenous and/or overexpressed SAP97 could affect synaptic targeting of endogenous GluR1-containing AMPA receptors. Toward this aim, hippocampal neurons were transfected with GFP-SAP97 constructs and labeled with GluR1 antibody to identify subcellular distribution of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors (Fig. 8). Neurons transfected with GFP-SAP97(S39D) (Fig. 8B) showed a characteristic punctate GluR1 staining in spine-like structures with an apparent increase in the size of GluR1 clusters but with a very similar distribution to those of neighboring untransfected neurons (Fig. 8A). Similar data were obtained with GFP-SAP97wt (data not shown) in agreement with previous observations indicating an increase in the size of GluR1 clusters in GFP-SAP97-expressing neurons (4Rumbaugh G. Sia G.M. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4567-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, transfection of GFP-SAP97(S39A) (Fig. 8C) resulted in a dramatic redistribution of GluR1 signal with an intense labeling in the cell soma and a diffuse dendritic staining, suggesting that CaMKII phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-39 phosphosite can also be necessary for synaptic trafficking of SAP97-interacting proteins, i.e. GluR1. Quantification of spines versus dendritic shafts GluR1 immunostaining by measuring the relative fluorescence intensity revealed a significative decrease of GluR1 fluorescent signal in spine structures (p <0.001, -48.7 ± 7.2%, GFP-SAP97(S39A) versus controls). In addition, experiments performed in untransfected neurons showed that inhibition of CaMKII by means of Ant-AIP-2 was responsible for a redistribution of endogenous GluR1 leading to a higher immunoreactivity within the soma and to a parallel decrease staining in the distal dendrites and spine-like structures (Fig. 8D). Quantification analysis revealed a significative decrease of GluR1 in spine structures as a consequence of CaMKII inhibition (p <0.0005, -65.8 ± 6.8%, Ant-AIP-2 versus controls). We next examined the effects of CaMKII inhibition by treatment with Ant-AIP-2 on GluR1 surface expression. Control and Ant-Aip-2 hippocampal cultures were treated with the cross-linker BS3 or with chymotrypsin (Fig. 8E). A significative increase in the GluR1 intracellular pool was observed with both experimental devices (BS3, p <0.01, +69.7 ± 10.3% Ant-AIP-2 versus control; chymotrypsin, p <0.01, +51.5 ± 8.9%, Ant-AIP-2 versus control). The identification of molecular events governing the correct assembly of the different components of the glutamatergic synapse has emerged as a fundamental issue in the understanding of synaptic activity, plasticity, and neurodegenerative processes. In the last few years, several lines of evidence indicated CaMKII activation as a key event in the regulation of glutamatergic synapses (18Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify an additional role for CaMKII in modulating postsynaptic trafficking of SAP97, a member of the MAGUK protein family. In fact, our data show that SAP97-Ser-39 CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation is indeed necessary and sufficient to drive SAP97 to the postsynaptic compartment in cultured hippocampal neurons. Recently, studies from our group demonstrated that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-232 within the PDZ1 domain modulates the association/dissociation of the SAP97-NR2A complex (6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of novel strategies regulating SAP97 function in hippocampal neurons. Here we confirm and expand the concept that CaMKII activation or inhibition results in a direct regulation of SAP97 function; indeed, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Ser-39 entails changes in SAP97 distribution and, consequently, in SAP97 synaptic localization. Transfection in hippocampal neurons of SAP97 mutants that blocked or mimicked Ser-39 phosphorylation has effects similar to those observed upon inhibiting or constitutively activating CaMKII, thus clearly addressing SAP97-Ser-39 as necessary and sufficient for modulation of SAP97 trafficking by CaMKII. No effect is obtained when wild type enzyme is transfected, suggesting that it is not αCaMKII per se but rather kinase activation-autophosphorylation, the key molecular event in the modulation of SAP97 distribution. In addition, double S39A,S232A mutation abolished CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97 in metabolic labeling experiments in transfected COS-7 cells. These data indicate the presence of two serine residues, in the L27 and PDZ1 domains, respectively, as major in vivo phosphosites in SAP97, supporting the idea that SAP97 acts as a multimodular element where distinct domains play differential roles for the correct delivery of excitatory glutamate receptors. Together, these results demonstrate that the translocation of SAP97 to the postsynaptic compartment is regulated by CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation and consequently suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of synaptic delivery of SAP97-interacting proteins, i.e. glutamate receptors. In fact, it is known that members of the MAGUK protein family have been implicated as major players in targeting and clustering of glutamate receptor subunits (1Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 2Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). SAP97 interacts with GluR1 early in the biosynthetic pathway of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors; therefore, it may play a role in maturation of receptor complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum-cis-Golgi and delivery of receptors to synapses, but not in anchoring AMPA receptors at synapses (7Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 8Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the last five years, several studies have been focused on understanding the multiple mechanisms by which AMPA receptor-mediated transmission is strengthened during long term potentiation, and the specific role of CaMKII in these mechanisms has been pointed out. Increased CaMKII activity, but not direct CaMKII phosphorylation of GluR1, was responsible for GluR1 delivery to the synapse (19Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Science. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 20Shi S. Hayashi Y. Esteban J.A. Malinow R. Cell. 2001; 105: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). This process requires interactions between GluR1 and PDZ domain-containing proteins. All these data suggest that some protein(s) other than GluR1 must be substrate(s) of CaMKII and participate in the regulated synaptic delivery of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors. Data presented here confirm and expand this hypothesis, identifying SAP97 phosphorylation by CaMKII as a key step in the complex and finely tuned mechanism governing SAP97 and GluR1-containing AMPA receptor delivery to the postsynaptic complex. Previous observations suggested that MAGUKs contain diverse signals within their N termini for postsynaptic targeting (21Firestein B.L. Craven S.E. Bredt D.S. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 3479-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PSD-95 and PSD-93 are highly concentrated at PSD, whereas SAP97 and SAP102, although found at synaptic densities, are abundant in the cytoplasm and associated with intracellular membranes (8Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that SAP97 immunoreactivity is primarily somatodendritic with enrichment in perinuclear and proximal dendrites regions in untreated cultures, although a moderate colocalization with PSD-95 in spine-like structures can also be found. This is in agreement with recent data on subcellular localization of SAP97 in primary hippocampal neurons (4Rumbaugh G. Sia G.M. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4567-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also with our recent biochemical studies showing an enrichment of SAP97 in the postsynaptic compartment (6Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Of relevance, we show here that both NMDA and caffeine treatments lead to a modification of SAP97 but not of PSD-95 and SAP102 distribution with a significative increase of SAP97 immunostaining in PSD-95-positive synaptic clusters. Biochemical fractionation experiments confirm confocal data showing a specific enrichment of SAP97 to a Triton-insoluble “PSD-like” fraction after NMDA activation when compared with the corresponding SAP97 level in TIF of untreated neurons. Co-treatment with different kinase inhibitors shows that SAP97 redistribution to spine-like structures is strictly dependent on CaMKII activation and specifically blocked by CaMKII inhibitors; in particular, treatment with CaMKII inhibitors leads to a strong colocalization pattern of SAP97 with the ER marker, DSI. Recent observations indicate that activation of RyRs in the hippocampus can play a role in synaptic plasticity events through the elevation of αCaMKII activity (16Kouzu Y. Moriya T. Takeshima H. Yoshioka T. Shibata S. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 76: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Currie S. Loughrey C.M. Craig M.A. Smith G.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that CaMKII might represent a potential enzymatic target of the calcium-induced calcium release from ER ryanodine stores. Our data, showing that coincubation with CaMKII inhibitor Ant-AIP-2 blocks any effect of caffeine on SAP97 trafficking, not only confirm a close relationship between calcium-induced calcium release and CaMKII function but also indicate the presence of different pools of CaMKII in hippocampal neurons activated upon different physiological stimuli. Our data show that CaMKII affects SAP97 targeting by direct phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-39. This phosphosite is located within the well described L27 N-terminal motif of SAP97 (22Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Karnak D. Lee S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46730-46735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the L27 domain of SAP97 binds to Hrs, an endosomal ATPase that regulates protein sorting and has been implicated in vesicular endocytosis and exocytosis (22Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the SAP97 (1-65) N-terminal domain, which is absent from PSD-95 and SAP102, has been shown to be responsible for subcellular membrane targeting of SAP97 in epithelial cells (24Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the N terminus of SAP97 may also be involved in neuronal targeting. Our data strengthen the role of the SAP97 N-terminal domain in the modulation of SAP97 localization, identifying inside the L27 motif a specific CaMKII phosphosite that is not conserved in PSD-95 and SAP102. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that other domains can affect subcellular targeting of SAP97 in neurons. Indeed, recent data showed that subcellular targeting of SAP97 to synaptic sites in primary dissociated hippocampal neurons is dependent on an alternatively spliced region between the SH3 and GK domains called the I3 region, a known protein 4.1 binding site (4Rumbaugh G. Sia G.M. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4567-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All these results suggest that SAP97 trafficking is a highly regulated mechanism of critical relevance for the correct delivery of excitatory glutamate receptors. Together, our results confirm that CaMKII plays a central role in excitatory neurons and confirm that activation of CaMKII and consequent kinase autophosphorylation is crucial not only in the synaptic site but also in extrasynaptic compartments to initiate the biochemical cascade that potentiates synaptic transmission. In particular, our data show that CaMKII-dependent SAP97-Ser-39 phosphorylation regulates the association of SAP97 with the postsynaptic complex, thus providing a fine molecular mechanism responsible for the synaptic delivery of SAP97-interacting proteins, i.e. ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits. We thank M. Passafaro for providing SAP97 cDNA and H. Schulman for providing αCaMKII cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2019538762,"Mechanisms governing viral replicative capacity are poorly understood at the biochemical level. Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) K65R or L74V substitutions confer viral resistance to 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine (ddI) in vivo. The two substitutions never occur together, and L74V is frequently found in patients receiving ddI, while K65R is not. Here we show that recombinant viruses carrying K65R and K65R/L74V display the same resistance level to ddI (about 9.5-fold) relative to wild type. Consistent with this result, purified HIV-1 RT carrying K65R RT or K65R/L74V substitutions exhibits an 8-fold resistance to ddATP as judged by pre-steady state kinetics of incorporation of a single nucleotide into DNA. Resistance is due to a selective decrease of the catalytic rate constant kpol: 22-fold (from 7.2 to 0.33 s-1) for K65R RT and 84-fold (from 7.2 to 0.086 s-1) for K65R/L74V RT. However, the K65R/L74V virus replication capacity is severely impaired relative to that of wild-type virus. This loss of viral fitness is correlated to a poor ability of K65R/L74V RT to use natural nucleotides relative to wild-type RT: 15% that of wild-type RT for dATP, 36% for dGTP, 50% for dTTP, and 25% for dCTP. The order of incorporation efficiency is wild-type RT > L74V RT > K65R RT > K65R/L74V RT. Processivity of DNA synthesis remains unaffected. These results explain why the two mutations do not combine in the clinic and might give a mechanism for a decreased viral fitness at the molecular level. Mechanisms governing viral replicative capacity are poorly understood at the biochemical level. Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) K65R or L74V substitutions confer viral resistance to 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine (ddI) in vivo. The two substitutions never occur together, and L74V is frequently found in patients receiving ddI, while K65R is not. Here we show that recombinant viruses carrying K65R and K65R/L74V display the same resistance level to ddI (about 9.5-fold) relative to wild type. Consistent with this result, purified HIV-1 RT carrying K65R RT or K65R/L74V substitutions exhibits an 8-fold resistance to ddATP as judged by pre-steady state kinetics of incorporation of a single nucleotide into DNA. Resistance is due to a selective decrease of the catalytic rate constant kpol: 22-fold (from 7.2 to 0.33 s-1) for K65R RT and 84-fold (from 7.2 to 0.086 s-1) for K65R/L74V RT. However, the K65R/L74V virus replication capacity is severely impaired relative to that of wild-type virus. This loss of viral fitness is correlated to a poor ability of K65R/L74V RT to use natural nucleotides relative to wild-type RT: 15% that of wild-type RT for dATP, 36% for dGTP, 50% for dTTP, and 25% for dCTP. The order of incorporation efficiency is wild-type RT > L74V RT > K65R RT > K65R/L74V RT. Processivity of DNA synthesis remains unaffected. These results explain why the two mutations do not combine in the clinic and might give a mechanism for a decreased viral fitness at the molecular level.

Because antiretroviral therapy does not completely suppress viral replication, a resulting selection pressure favors the emergence of mutant viruses that partially or completely lose sensitivity to one or several inhibitors (1Menendez-Arias L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2Miller V. Larder B.A. Antivir. Ther. 2001; 6: 25-44PubMed Google Scholar). Such an example is given by the progressive appearance of primary mutations in the viral pol gene encoding the reverse transcriptase (RT) after prolonged treatments that make use of dideoxynucleosides. K65R and L74V substitutions in RT are typically associated with a moderate resistance to ddI and ddC, and these substitutions are directly responsible for a loss of efficacy of these drugs in patients carrying the corresponding mutant viruses. We previously reported the molecular role of the K65R substitution in the multiple resistance to dideoxynucleotides (3Selmi B. Boretto J. Sarfati S.R. Guerreiro C. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48466-48472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Lysine at position 65 is located in the flexible β3-β4 loop located in the finger domain of the p66 monomer of RT. The side chain of the Arg-65 interacts with the γ-phosphate of the incoming nucleotide and alters the catalytic rate of creation of the phosphodiester bond for dideoxynucleotides specifically (3Selmi B. Boretto J. Sarfati S.R. Guerreiro C. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48466-48472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The K65R mutation is found infrequently (less than 2%) on viral isolates from patients treated with ddI and ddC and gives a moderate 2–10-fold decrease in the sensitivity to these two drugs (4Zhang D.

K65R also has been described to give in vitro RT-mediated resistance to tenofovir (6Wainberg M.A. Miller M.D. Quan Y. Salomon H. Mulato A.S. Lamy P.D. Margot N.A. Anton K.E. Cherrington J.M. Antivir. Ther. 1999; 4: 87-94PubMed Google Scholar). We recently have shown that the molecular effect of K65R mutation on tenofovir is identical to the one previously described for ddNTPs (7Deval J. White K.L. Miller M.D. Parkin N.T. Courcambeck J. Halphon P. Selmi B. Boretto J. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). L74V, unlike K65R, is the most frequently observed mutation in patients receiving ddI (8St. Clair M.H. Martin J.L. Tudor-Williams G. Bach M.C. Vavro C.L. King D.M. Kellam P. Kemp S.D. Larder B.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1557-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). It has been found in up to 48% of the patients under ddI monotherapy (9Winters M.A. Shafer R.W. Jellinger R.A. Mamtora G. Gingeras T. Merigan T.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 757-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of resistance to ddI given by L74V is similar to that given by K65R (8St. Clair M.H. Martin J.L. Tudor-Williams G. Bach M.C. Vavro C.L. King D.M. Kellam P. Kemp S.D.

However, little is known about the precise role of the amino acid at position 74, which does not make a direct contact with the incoming nucleotide. Leu-74 makes a van der Waals contact with the +1 DNA template base (15Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar) and also interacts with the side chain of Gln-151 and Arg-72 whose contribution in the catalytic reaction is better understood (16Sarafianos S.G. Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7207-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Sarafianos S.G. Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42097-42104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Many questions remain concerning the emergence, selection, preference, and persistence of one drug resistance mutation relative to another. As a matter of fact, these two substitutions, K65R and L74V, are not found associated together in the clinic (9Winters M.A. Shafer R.W. Jellinger R.A. Mamtora G. Gingeras T. Merigan T.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 757-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that their simultaneous occurrence would not be advantageous for the virus. Knowledge of the molecular role of these amino acids would yield useful information. For example, these substitutions might confer unexpected ddI sensitivity to HIV when present together in RT. Alternatively they might confer a “ddN-super-resistant” phenotype to HIV-1, suggesting their simultaneous occurrence could potentially be selected under a higher selective pressure. As a third possibility, they might not be tolerated together at the RT active site, yielding a non-functional or impaired RT. In any case, knowledge of the role of these amino acids in the RT active site might have some relevance for future drug design. Although the interplay of drug resistance and viral fitness is increasingly apparent (19Quinones-Mateu M.E. Arts E.J. Drug Resist. Updat. 2002; 5: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms describing how an impaired RT influences viral fitness are still unclear at present. To address these questions, we studied the properties of K65R/L74V double mutant both at viral and enzymatic levels. The mechanism of drug resistance by K65R/L74V was investigated using recombinant viruses and elucidated at the molecular level using purified RT and pre-steady state kinetics. We find that K65R and L74V do not combine into a ddN-super-resistant virus and that the simultaneous presence of both substitutions in RT affects viral replication capacity through alteration of the interaction of natural nucleotides with the RT active site. Recombinant HIV-1 Molecular Clone Constructions—The 1258-bp ClaI-Eco47III fragment of the p66RTB vector containing mutations K65R, L74V, or K65R/L74V was introduced in the same restriction sites as described previously into the p66RTB-AD8 vector (20Navarro J.M. Damier L. Boretto J. Priet S. Canard B. Querat G. Sire J. Virology. 2001; 290: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was then digested with MscI restriction enzyme, and the 1.9-kb MscI fragment was subsequently cloned back in the same restriction sites in the pNL4.3 HIV-1 proviral molecular clone to obtain the pNL4.3 RTB plasmids mutated in the RT gene. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Infections—293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum. C8166 and H9 T cell lines were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. To obtain wild-type (WT) and K65R, L74V, or K65R/L74V viral stocks, 293T cells were transiently transfected by the use of FuGENE 6 transfectant reagent (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Two days post-transfection, cell-free supernatants containing viruses were titrated by assaying the fusogenic properties on C8166 cells. C8166 cells (1 × 105 cells/well in triplicates) were seeded on 96-well microtiter culture plates (Costar) and infected with serial 5-fold dilutions of each viral stock. Cells were examined for cytopathic effects on day 5 of culture, and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of viral stocks was determined. To analyze the replicative properties of each viral stock, H9 T cells (1 × 106) were infected with virus calibrated to infect at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001. Two-milliliter cultures were done in duplicate using 6-well tissue culture plates (Costar). Supernatants (0.5 ml) from each culture were collected twice a week, and cultures were supplemented with fresh medium. The p24 antigen was quantitated in cell-free culture supernatants and used as a marker of replication kinetics. IC50 Measurement—The susceptibility of RTs from recombinant viruses to ddI was determined by measuring IC50 values using reverse transcriptase activity assay. C8166 cells (1 × 106 cells/well in triplicates) seeded on 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar) were treated with increasing concentrations (2, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 60 μm) of ddI and immediately infected during 24 h with each viral stock calibrated for a m.o.i. of 0.005. Cells were then washed twice in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium before being grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of increasing amounts of ddI. Day two postinfection, the cell-free supernatant was removed and monitored for the reverse transcriptase (21Selmi B. Boretto J. Navarro J.M. Sire J. Longhi S. Guerreiro C. Mulard L. Sarfati S. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13965-13974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Inhibition (IC50) was expressed as the concentration of inhibitor producing a 50% inhibition of virus growth. Determination of Viral DNA Copy Number by Real Time PCR— Viral stocks obtained from transfected 293T cells were filtered through 0.45-μm-pore-size filters and treated with 20 μg/ml DNase I (Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. H9 cells (1 × 106) were infected for 2 h by spinoculation (22O'Doherty U. Swiggard W. Malim M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10074-10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) with equal amounts of each of the RT mutant viruses, and then cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in fresh medium for 15 additional h. The total DNA was isolated from the infected cells by the QIAamp DNA minikit protocol (Qiagen) and eluted with 200 μl of elution buffer. DNA samples were quantitated by optical density at 260 nm. Viral DNA products corresponding to the different steps of reverse transcription were assessed by quantitative real time PCR as described in the literature (23Butler S. Hansen M. Bushman F. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Real time PCR was performed with an ABI PRISM 7000 apparatus (Applied Biosystems) using PCR primers and Taqman probes described previously (23Butler S. Hansen M. Bushman F. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The mixture contained 15 μl of Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 500 ng of nucleic acids (10 μl), 0.9 μl of primers, and 0.3 μl of probe. The PCR primers and Taqman probes were present at a final concentration of 200 nm. Unknown samples were compared with duplicate samples containing 107–103 copies of plasmid DNA. The cycling conditions were 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The Taqman primer sets used to monitor initiation were as follows: Forward primer, 5′-AAC TAG GGA ACC CAC TGC TTA AG-3′; Reverse primer, 5′-CTG CTAG AGA TTT TCC ACA CTG AC-3′; Taqman probe, 5′-R-ACA CTA CTT GAA GCA CTC AAG GCA AGC TTT-Q-3′, and the Taqman primer sets used to monitor elongation were as follows: Forward primer, 5′-TGT GTG CCC GTC TGT TGT GT-3′; Reverse primer, 5′-GAG TCC TGC GTC GAG AGA TC-3′; Taqman probe, 5′-R-CAG TGG CGC CCG AAC AGG GA-Q-3′ where R is the reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescin and Q is the quencher 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. HIV-RT Plasmid Constructions, Enzyme Preparations, and Reagents—The wild-type RT gene construct p66RTB was used to obtain K65R, L74V, and K65R/L74V RT as described previously (24Boretto J. Longhi S. Navarro J.M. Selmi B. Sire J. Canard B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant RTs were co-expressed with HIV-1 protease in Escherichia coli to obtain p66/p51 heterodimers, which were later purified using affinity chromatography. All enzymes were quantitated by active site titration before biochemical studies. DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). γ-32P-Labeled adenosine 5′-triphosphate was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Pre-steady State Kinetics of Single Nucleotide Incorporation into DNA—Pre-steady state kinetics were performed using dATP, dTTP, dCTP, dGTP, and ddATP in conjunction with wild-type, K65R, L74V, and K65R/L74V RT. Rapid quench experiments were performed with a Kintek Instruments Model RQF-3 using reaction times ranging from 10 ms to 30 s. All indicated concentrations are final. The primer DNA/DNA oligonucleotides used for the rapid reaction were a 5′-labeled 21-mer primer (5′-ATA CTT TAA CCA TAT GTA TCC-3′) annealed to a 31-mer template, 31T-RT (5′-TTT TTT TTT AGG ATA CAT ATG GTT AAA GTA T-3′), for the incorporation of dTTP, 31A-RT (5′-AAA AAA AAA TGG ATA CAT ATG GTT AAA GTA T-3′) for the incorporation of dATP/ddATP, 31C-RT primer (5′-TTT TTT TTT GGG ATA CAT ATG GTT AAA GTA T-3′) for the incorporation of dCTP, and 31G-RT primer (5′-TTT TTT TTT CGG ATA CAT ATG GTT AAA GTA T-3′) for the incorporation of dGTP. For natural nucleotides, the reaction was performed by mixing a solution containing 50 nm (active sites) HIV-1 RT bound to 100 nm primer/template in RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100), and a variable concentration of dNTP in 6 mm MgCl2. Reactions involving ddATP were conducted with excess concentrations of enzyme (200 nm) over primer/template duplex (100 nm). As described before (18Deval J. Selmi B. Boretto J. Egloff M.P. Guerreiro C. Sarfati S. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42097-42104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), these conditions were chosen to eliminate the influence of the enzyme turnover rate (kss) that interferes in the measurements of low incorporation rates. The products of reactions were analyzed using sequencing gel electrophoresis (14% acrylamide, 8 m urea in Tris borate-EDTA buffer) and quantified using photostimulated plates and a FujiImager. The formation of product (P) over time was fitted with a burst equation, P=A⋅(1−exp(−(kapp⋅t))+kss⋅t(Eq. 1) where A is the amplitude of the burst, kapp is the apparent kinetic constant of formation of the phosphodiester bond, and kss is the enzyme turnover rate, i.e. the kinetic constant of the steady state linear phase. The dependence of kapp on dNTP concentration is described by the hyperbolic equation, kapp=kpol⋅[dNTP]/(Kd+[dNTP])(Eq. 2) where Kd and kpol are the equilibrium constant and the catalytic rate constant of the dNTP for RT, respectively. Kd and kpol were determined from curve fitting using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). Assays of RT DNA Polymerization Rate and Processivity—The rate of polymerization was measured using a 5′-labeled oligo(dT)21 primer annealed to poly(rA) or a 5′-labeled oligo(dA)21 primer annealed to poly(rU). Extension products were analyzed using a gel assay. The primer/template (25 nm) was incubated with RT (50 nm) in RT buffer at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 500 μm dNTP (dTTP or dATP) in 6 mm MgCl2 and quenched at various times by 0.3 m EDTA. The processivity assay was performed under the same experimental conditions with poly(rA)/oligo(dT) for 2 min with 2 μg/μl heparin and an excess of unlabeled primer/template added to the dTTP/MgCl2 mixture. The control reaction was assayed by adding heparin together with the enzyme before starting the reaction. Molecular Modeling of dATP and ddATP in the RT Active Site— Molecular modeling was performed using GenMol (25Pepe G. Siri D. Stud. Phys. Theor. Chem. 1990; 71: 93-101Google Scholar, 26Pepe G. Guiliani G. Loustalet S. Halfon P. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 37: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with its all-atoms force field module from the x-ray crystal structure of wild-type RT·dNTP·DNA ternary complex (15Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Modeling was performed with a 25-Å-radius sphere centered on the catalytic DNA polymerase domain. This model of HIV-RT included the residues of both p66 and p51 domain, DNA template/primer, two magnesium ions, and dTTP. Close attention was given to both magnesium ions as they have a key role in positioning the incoming dNTP or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and in catalysis per se. To prepare the closed RT·DNA·dTTP complex (15Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar), the authors used a ddGMP primer terminus positioned at the so-called “Priming site” (P site (27Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar)). We replaced ddGMP by dGMP, and interactions of 3′-OH with Mg2+ were optimized. In the crystal structure, both magnesium ions were complexed with residues Asp-185, Asp-110, and Val-111. The complexation process of Mg2+ with the incoming nucleotide via its triphosphate chain and residues Asp-110, Val-111, and Asp-185 was optimized using a conformational analysis and found to be the same as in the crystal structure of the ternary complex made of RT·DNA·dTTP. The complexation of the second Mg2+ was also optimized. Positions of Asp-186 and Asp-110 side chains were adjusted and optimized. This second Mg2+ was complexed with Asp-186 (Oδ-1 carboxylate side chain), Asp-185 (Oδ-2 carboxylate side chain), and the 3′-OH dGMP primer terminus. All minimizations were conducted using Linux RedHat 7.3 workstations and a 2.0 GHz bi-Xeon Pentium® 4 processor. Hydrogen atoms were added to the enzyme, DNA duplex, and dTTP within the Biopolymer module of GenMol. Hydrogen positions were then optimized. The construction of the nucleotide triphosphate was based on x-ray conformation of dTTP present in the ternary complex RT·DNA·dTTP. All atom charges were computed with GenMol for RT-DNA, both Mg2+, dATP, and ddATP (25Pepe G. Siri D. Stud. Phys. Theor. Chem. 1990; 71: 93-101Google Scholar, 26Pepe G. Guiliani G. Loustalet S. Halfon P. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 37: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The substituted RT structures were obtained by changing selected amino acids (K65R and L74V). The adenine at position 5 of the template was mutated to thymine, the counterpart of the incoming nucleotide analogue dATP and ddATP. The conformation of this fifth template nucleotide and the side chain of selected amino acids 65 and 74 were minimized within the Biopolymer module of GenMol using a conformational analysis method. Finally the incoming nucleotide was docked into the DNA-polymerase active site from the positioning of dTTP present in the x-ray structure ternary complex (nucleoside binding site, N site). The resulting ternary complexes were optimized using the GenMol all-atoms force field module. Fig. 2 was done and rendered using Swiss-PdbViewer and Povray, 2See www.povray.org. respectively. K65R or L74V substitutions in RT are known to be associated with ddN resistance in nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-treated patients (4Zhang D. Caliendo A.M. Eron J.J. DeVore K.M. Kaplan J.C. Hirsch M.S. D'Aquila R.T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5Gu Z. Gao Q. Fang H. Salomon H. Parniak M.A. Goldberg E. Cameron J.

Kemp S.D. Larder B.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1557-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, viruses carrying the K65R/L74V double substitution are almost never reported in the clinic. To understand this apparent mutual exclusion, we constructed and studied a K65R/L74V recombinant virus. The corresponding K65R/L74V RT was expressed independently, purified, and biochemically characterized. Viral replication capacity and drug resistance were measured at the virus and enzyme level comparatively. Resistance of Wild-type, K65R, L74V, and K65R/L74V Recombinant Viruses to ddI—Resistance to ddI by wild-type, K65R, L74V, and K65R/L74V viruses was investigated by examining the replication of viruses in ddI-treated cells. C8166 cells were infected, in the presence of increasing amounts of ddI, with each viral stock calibrated to the same m.o.i. Two days postinfection, the reverse transcriptase activity in the cell-free supernatant was measured, and the resistance was expressed as the concentration of inhibitor inducing a 50% inhibition of virus growth. As shown in Table I, mutant viruses exhibited a significantly higher resistance to ddI compared with wild-type viruses with a 5-fold increase for L74V and a 9.5-fold increase for K65R and K65R/L74V virus. The sole K65R mutation conferred the resistance to ddI at levels similar to that of the K65R/L74V mutation (IC50 = 38 μm), indicating that the additional L74V mutation did not increase ddI resistance. The L74V mutation alone displayed a lower IC50 (20 μm) than that of the double K65R/L74V mutations. It is tempting to speculate that resistance of the double mutant is due to the K65R mutation and is not increased further with the addition of the L74V mutation.Table IGrowth inhibition of WT HIV-1 and variants carrying the K65R, L74V, or K65R/L74V mutations by ddIVirusWTK65RL74VK65R/L74VIC50 (μm)aThe concentration of drug that produced a 50% inhibition of virus growth estimated by the reverse transcriptase activity in the cell-free supernatant was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures”4 ± 0.838 ± 7.420 ± 2.538 ± 2ResistancebValues indicate drug resistance of mutants relative to wild-type HIV-19.5×5×9.5×a The concentration of drug that produced a 50% inhibition of virus growth estimated by the reverse transcriptase activity in the cell-free supernatant was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures”b Values indicate drug resistance of mutants relative to wild-type HIV-1 Open table in a new tab Resistance of K65R, L74V, and K65R/L47V RT to ddATP— Using pre-steady state kinetics with a single nucleotide incorporation, we tested the role of K65R, L74V, and K65R/L74V substitutions in RT-mediated ddI resistance. ddATP, the active metabolite of ddI, was used in conjunction with purified RT. The nucleotide affinity Kd is calculated as the nucleotide concentration that gives half of the maximum incorporation rate kpol. A nucleotide analogue 5′-triphosphate is characterized by its efficiency of incorporation (kpol/Kd) into DNA as compared with that of its natural counterpart. For a given RT, comparing kpol/Kd values between a natural dNTP and its corresponding analogue is a convenient manner to evaluate selectivity for (or discrimination of) the analogue. Comparing selectivity between RTs defines in vitro resistance (or susceptibility) at the enzymatic level. Single nucleotide incorporation constants are presented in Table II. Wild-type RT discriminated ddATP relative to dATP. The difference of incorporation efficiency between the two substrates comes exclusively from an altered incorporation rate: 50 s-1 for dATP and 7.2 s-1 for ddATP, leading to a 7.4-fold discrimination. The affinity, however, remained the same for dATP and ddATP (Kd = 7.5–8 μm). As described before, K65R RT exhibits a “kpol-dependent resistance” to ddATP (3Selmi B. Boretto J. Sarfati S.R. Guerreiro C. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48466-48472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Note that the differences in kinetic constants for ddATP (compared with Selmi et al. (3Selmi B. Boretto J. Sarfati S.R. Guerreiro C. Canard B. J. Biol.

This high discrimination of the dideoxynucleotide over its natural counterpart was generated by a low incorporation rate of ddATP by K65R RT: kpol = 0.33 s-1, which was 22-fold lower than in the case of WT RT (illustrated in Fig. 1). It yielded an overall 8-fold resistance to ddATP by K65R RT. In the case of L74V RT,"

Achieving a high throughput of cardiogenesis from pluripotent cells is therefore a major requirement for future approaches in cardiac cell therapy. Here, we developed a novel ester of hyaluronan linked to both butyric and retinoic acid (HBR), coaxing pluripotent ES cells into a cardiogenic decision. In mouse ES cells, HBR remarkably increased the expression of GATA-4 and Nkx-2.5, acting as cardiac lineage-promoting genes in different animal species, including humans. HBR also enhanced prodynorphin gene expression and the synthesis and secretion of dynorphin B, an endorphin playing a major role in ES cell cardiogenesis. These effects occurred at the transcriptional level. HBR also primed the expression of cardiac-specific transcripts and highly enhanced the yield of spontaneously beating ES-derived cardiomyocytes. These results demonstrate the potential for chemically modifying the gene program of cardiac differentiation in ES cells without the aid of gene transfer technologies and may pave the way for novel approaches in tissue engineering and myocardial regeneration.

Nadal-Ginard B. Bodine D.M. Leri A. Anversa P. Nature. 2001; 410: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar). Because the rescuing potential of ES cells is limited by the fact that ES-derived cardiomyocytes withdraw early from the cell cycle (1Klug M.G. Soonpaa M.H. Koh G.Y. Field L.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 3Klug M.G. Soonpaa M.H. Field L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1913-H1921Google Scholar), the development of strategies affording high throughput of cardiogenesis from pluripotent cells would have obvious therapeutic potential. However, overexpression of cardiogenic genes by vector-mediated gene transfer is a cumbersome approach that may perturb normal homeostasis in both ES cells and recipient tissues and is not readily envisionable in humans. Here, we developed hyaluronan monoesters with retinoic acid alone (HR) and its mixed esters with retinoic and butyric acid (HBR) and provided evidence that these compounds act as novel differentiating agents eliciting a remarkable increase in the yield of cardiomyocytes derived from mouse ES cells. A number of interrelated observations prompt a rationale behind the synthesis of the novel glycoconjugate HBR. From the earliest observable stage of mouse heart development, the hyaluronan receptor CD44 is highly expressed by presumptive cardiogenic cells and by the fused endothelial tubes and surrounding muscular epimyocardium within the early embryonic heart (4Wheatley S.C. Isacke C.M. Crossley P.H. Development. 1993; 119: 295-306PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of hyaluronan synthase-2 abrogates normal cardiac morphogenesis and hyaluronan-mediated transformation of mouse epithelium into mesenchyme (5Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T.

Immunol. 1994; 3: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Within this context, hyaluronan can be translocated into various cell types via a receptor-mediated endocytosis because it is consistently detected in close association with nuclear heterochromatin (7Tammi R. Rilla K. Pienimaki J.P. MacCallum D.K. Hogg M. Luukkonen M. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35111-35122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 8Collis L.

Moreover, intracellular hyaluronan-binding molecules (hyaladherins) translocate to the nucleus upon mitogenic stimulation (9Majumdar M. Meenakshi J. Goswami S.K. Datta K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These findings suggest that hyaluronan that is taken up may regulate cellular events from within subcellular compartments and may also act as a carrier for internalization of hyaluronan-grafting synthetic compounds. An interference of retinoic acid (RA) signaling with cardiac differentiation resulted from the finding that inactivation of the RXRα gene and vitamin A deficiency caused embryonal death owing to cardiac hypoplasia and ventricular chamber defects (13Sucov H.M. Dyson E. Gumeringer C.L. Price J. Chien K.R. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Dramatic abnormalities in heart development were also obtained by combining mouse strains with mutant RAR and RXR subtypes (14Kastner P. Grondona J.M. Mark M. Gansmuller A. LeMeur M. Decimo D.

Moreover, in vitro studies demonstrated that all-trans RA increased the efficiency of cardiogenic differentiation in ES cells (16Wobus A.M. Kaomei G. Shan J. Wellner M.C. Rohwedel J. Ji G.

Concerning butyrate, its histone deacetylase inhibitory action alters chromatin structure, ultimately increasing transcription factor accessibility to target cis-acting regulatory sites (17Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Accordingly, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors interact with transcriptional coactivators possessing histone acetyltransferase activity (18Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V.

Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar) and histone deacetylase inhibitors have been reported to enhance RXR/RAR heterodimer action, promoting crucial developmental pathways in pluripotent cells (19Dilworth F.J.

Preparation of Tetrabutylammonium Hyaluronate (HA-TBA)—HATBA was synthesized by recycling a 5% w/w solution in Milli-Q distilled water (Millipore) of sodium hyaluronate (Bioiberica), whose weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was 85,000, through Amberlite IR-120 (plus) ion exchange resin in TBA form at room temperature for 24 h. The collected HA-TBA solution was finally freeze-dried. Amberlite IR-120 (plus) ion exchange resin in acidic form (Aldrich) was previously converted into TBA form by treating with a 40% w/w aqueous solution of TBA hydroxide (Fluka) that was recycled in a jacket column at 40 °C for 4 days. The resin in TBA form was then washed with distilled water to reduce the pH value below 10. Synthesis of Two Different HBR—HA-TBA (5 g; 8.1·10-3 eq, i.e. molar equivalents, i.e. moles of dimeric repeating units) was dissolved in 40% w/w aqueous TBA hydroxide (5.2 ml; 7.8·10-3 eq). The solution was then frozen and freeze-dried. Hereafter, all reactions were carried out at room temperature under magnetic stirring, under nitrogen flux, and by sheltering from light. The lyophilized TBA alcoholate of HA-TBA and all-trans RA (2.4 g; 8.0·10-3 eq) (BASF) were separately dissolved in dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (300 and 20 ml, respectively) (Fluka). Meanwhile, dry DMF (1 ml; 1.3·10-2 eq) and oxalyl chloride (1 ml; 1.1·10-2 eq) (Fluka) were added to dry diethylether (5 ml) (Fluka). After a few minutes, the RA solution in DMF was added dropwise onto the obtained white solid (dimethylchloroformamidinium chloride) during 20 min. After 1 h, the clear deep red solution of retinoyl chloride was added by a dropping funnel at a flow rate of 1 ml/minute to the solution of TBA alcoholate of HA-TBA. The reaction mixture was kept in the same conditions as above for 17 h. The dark brown solution was then subdivided in two exactly equal fractions, called A and B. A was concentrated to about one third of the original volume by using a rotary film evaporator under reduced pressure. The polymer was precipitated into three volumes of diethylether and recuperated by suction filtration. The dark brown amorphous precipitate was dissolved again in dry DMF (100 ml), and triethylammine (300 μl; 2.2·10-3 eq) (Aldrich) was then added to neutralize the acidic reagents. Butyrylation was carried out overnight by addition of butyric anhydride (640 μl; 3.9·10-3 eq) (Fluka) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (2 g; 1.6·10-2 eq) (Fluka) to each one of the fractions. The raw products were precipitated from both A and B into 3 volumes of diethyl ether, recovered by suction filtration, washed several times with diethylether and acetone, and, lastly, dried under vacuum. After dissolution of the dry solids in distilled water and neutralization with 0.1 m aqueous NaOH, the polymers were purified by dialysis against Milli-Q distilled water, using a cellulose membrane tubing (Visking) with a molecular weight cut-off in the range of 12,000-14,000, and then by recycling the retained solutions through Amberlite IR-120 (plus) ion exchange resin in sodium form (30 ml; 5.7·10-2 eq) (Aldrich) for 1 h. Two butyric and retinoic mixed esters of sodium hyaluronate (Fig. 1) were ultimately obtained as lyophilized solids by freeze-drying from A (0.8 g; 1.7·10-3 eq; 21% yield) and B (1.2 g; 2.7·10-3 eq; 33% yield). The products HBR were characterized by spectroscopy of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). The spectra, recorded in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO-d6) at 500 MHz on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer, showed the signals due to the protons of the polysaccharide and to all the protons of RA. From evaluation of the chemical shifts related to the signals due to RA, RA was confirmed to keep its all-trans isomeric form. The signals that confirmed the presence of butyrate residues (δ 0.90, 1.62, 2.39 ppm) were detected as well; they allowed the determination of the degree of substitution with butyric acid (DSBU), which were 0.94 and 0.45 in the cases of A and B, respectively. The DS with retinoic acid (DSRA) (0.046 for A and 0.066 for B) were determined by comparison of the UV-visible absorption spectra (Varian UV-VIS CARY 3E spectrophotometer) at the absorbance maximum (λmax = 359 nm in Me2SO) of standard RA solutions with those of HBR solutions (in the presence of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid) at known concentration. Synthesis of an HR Having DSRA = 0.12—The procedure was the same as described in the case of HBR for synthesis as far as retinoylation and for purification after butyrylation by doubling all the starting materials except HA-TBA (5 g; 8.1·10-3 eq). A retinoic ester of sodium hyaluronate (Fig. 1, formula with y = 0) was finally obtained as lyophilized solid by freeze-drying (1.7 g; 3.9·10-3 eq; 48% yield). As for HBR, the product HR was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which revealed the presence of signals attributable to residues of retinoate, and by UV-VIS spectrophotometry, which allowed the determination of the DSRA, which was 0.12. Synthesis of an HB Having DSBU = 0.062—The following reaction was carried out at room temperature, under mechanical stirring, and under nitrogen flux. HA-TBA (55 g; 8.9·10-2 eq) was completely dissolved in dry DMF (3 liters). The acylating agent was prepared by mixing butyric anhydride (4 ml; 2.45·10-2 eq) and (dimethylamino)pyridine (3 g; 2.46·10-2 eq) in dry DMF (200 ml). The latter solution was added dropwise to the former one during 25 min, and the reaction was continued for a further 65 min. The TBA salt of HB was converted into the correspondent sodium salt by addition of distilled water (∼6 liters), acidification with 0.1 m aqueous HCl, and neutralization with 1 m aqueous NaOH. The polymer was purified as described in the case of HBR by dialysis against Milli-Q distilled water (14 times with 30 liters) and then by ion exchange with Amberlite IR-120 (plus) resin (500 ml; 0.95 eq). A butyric ester of sodium hyaluronate (Fig. 1, formula with z = 0) was finally obtained as lyophilized solid by freeze-drying (34 g; 8.4·10-2 eq; 94% yield). As for HBR, the product HB was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which revealed the presence of signals attributable to residues of butyrate and which allowed the determination of the DSBU that was 0.062. Determination of the Molecular Weight of Hyaluronan Esters—Molecular weight was determined by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC). The analysis conditions were as follows. Chromatograph: HPLC Jasco PU-880 with Rheodyne 9125 injector. Columns: TSK PWXL G6000, G5000, and G3000 (TosoHaas), temperature 40 °C, mobile phase 0.15 m NaCl, flow rate 0.8 ml/minute. Detectors: low angle laser light scattering CMX-100 (Chromatix); differential refraction index 410 (Waters), sensitivity 128×, temperature 32 °C. The products were dissolved in 0.15 m NaCl at a concentration of ∼1.0 mg/ml and kept under stirring for 12 h. The solutions were filtered through 0.45-μm pore size filters (Millipore) and then injected (100 μl) into the chromatograph. The concentrations of the hyaluronan solutions were checked by the integral of the refractive index. The analysis allowed the determination of the weight-average molecular weight (Mw), the number-average molecular weight (Mn), and the distribution of molecular weight by using a broad standard calibration (based on sodium hyaluronate). The Mw of HBR and HR were determined to range between 10,000-30,000, whereas the Mw of HB was determined to range between 50,000-85,000. ES Cell Culture—GTR1, a derivative of R1 ES cells (21Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) bearing the puromycin-resistance gene driven by the cardiomyocyte-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter, were kindly provided by Dr. William L. Stanford (University of Toronto and Centre for Modeling Human Disease, Canada). Cardiac differentiation and puromycin selection of ES-derived cardiomyocytes were performed as previously described in detail (22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in the undifferentiated state by culturing onto a layer of mitotically inactivated mouse embryo fibroblasts in the presence of knockout Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum, supplemented with a final concentration of 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Before embryoid bodies (EBs) can be made, subconfluent undifferentiated ES cells are harvested from feeder layers by trypsinization, transferred onto 0.1% gelatin-coated plates, and grown to about 70-80% confluence in the presence of LIF-supplemented knockout Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum. These cells were used as undifferentiated cells in each experiment. The undifferentiated state of cells cultured with LIF on both feeder layers and gelatinized plates was inferred from the high percentage of cells positively stained for alkaline phosphatase activity and from the lack of nestin-positive cells. To induce cardiac differentiation, cells were plated onto specialty plates (Costar ultra low attachment clusters) containing the culture medium lacking supplemental LIF. After 2 days of culture, the EBs were plated onto tissue culture dishes. When spontaneous contractile activity was noticed (7 days after LIF removal), puromycin (2 μg/ml) was added to eliminate non-cardiomyocytes and puromycin-selected cells were cultured for an additional 7 days. Analysis of myosin heavy chain (MHC) immunoreactivity revealed that at this stage cardiomyocytes comprised more than 99% of selected cells. EBs, collected at several stages after plating, as well as puromycin-selected cells were processed for gene expression and immunofluorescence analyses. In selected experiments, GTR1 or parental R1 cells were also committed to neurogenesis or myogenesis as previously described (23Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the neurogenic commitment EBs were cultured for 4 days on Costar ultra low attachment clusters containing the culture medium lacking supplemental LIF in the presence of 0.5 μm RA. Then, cells were plated onto tissue culture dishes without RA and processed for the analysis of neurogenin-1 gene transcription after an additional 4 days. To elicit development into skeletal muscle cells, EBs were cultured for 4 days onto ultra low attachment clusters in the presence of the culture medium lacking supplemental LIF containing 30 nm sodium selenite, bovine serum albumin (0.19%), and 0.01 mg/ml transferrin. Afterward, cells were plated on tissue culture dishes and processed for the analysis of MyoD gene transcription after an additional 7 days. Gene Expression—Total RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and PCR conditions were previously described (22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Ventura C. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Prodynorphin, GATA-4, and Nkx-2.5 mRNAs were assessed by RNase protection assay as detailed elsewhere (22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fragments of the main exon of mouse prodynorphin gene (424 bp), GATA-4 (292 bp), or Nkx-2.5 (414 bp) genes were inserted into pCRII-TOPO. Transcription of the plasmid linearized with ApaI, BamHI, or XbaI generated sense strands of prodynorphin, GATA-4, or Nkx-2.5 mRNA, respectively, that were used to construct a standard mRNA curve. Transcription in the presence of [32P]CTP of plasmids linearized with BamHI generated antisense strands of prodynorphin and Nkx-2.5 mRNA, whereas transcription of plasmids linearized with XbaI produced an antisense strand of GATA-4 mRNA. Isolation of ES Cell Nuclei and Nuclear Run-off Transcription Assay—Isolation of nuclei and assessment of nuclear purity were performed as detailed elsewhere (22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Only freshly isolated nuclei were used in each experiment. Nuclear run-off experiments were carried out as previously described (23Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear RNA was isolated by using guanidine thiocyanate and acid phenol extraction, followed by purification on RNAMATRIX™. Equal counts of 32P-labeled RNA (about 5·106 cpm) were then subjected to a solution hybridization RNase protection assay and were hybridized for 12 h at 55 °C in the presence of unlabeled antisense GATA-4, Nkx-2.5, prodynorphin, MyoD, or neurogenin-1 mRNA. To generate these cRNA probes, fragments of the main exon of mouse prodynorphin gene (424 bp), GATA-4 (292 bp), Nkx-2.5 (414 bp), MyoD (425 bp) or neurogenin-1 (also called neuroD3) (742 bp) genes were inserted into a pCRII-TOPO vector. Transcription of plasmids linearized with BamHI generated antisense strands of prodynorphin, Nkx-2.5, and MyoD mRNA, whereas transcription of plasmids linearized with XbaI produced an antisense strand of GATA-4 and neurogenin-1 mRNA. Samples were then incubated with a combination of RNase A and T1 and exposed to proteinase K. The protected fragments were recovered after phenol chloroform extraction and electrophoretically separated in a polyacrylamide non-denaturing gel. Autoradiographic exposure was for 48 h. 32P-labeled nuclear RNA was also hybridized with unlabeled antisense cyclophilin mRNA synthesized from an NcoI-linearized pBS vector containing a 270-base pair fragment of plB15, a cDNA clone encoding for rat cyclophilin (23Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cyclophilin mRNA was utilized as a constant mRNA for control. Immunofluorescence Analysis of ES-derived Cardiomyocytes—Puromycin-selected cells were treated with trypsin, and the resulting suspension was cultured at low density to permit visualization of individual cells. The cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. MHC was assessed by the aid of the MF 20 mouse antimyosin monoclonal antibody (22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All microscopy was performed with a Bio-Rad Microradians confocal microscope. DNA was visualized with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml). Identification of Dynorphin B-like Material—Immunoreactive dynorphin B was measured, as previously detailed (22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Ventura C. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), by a radioimmunoassay procedure that utilized the 13 S antiserum raised against dynorphin B capable of recognizing the high molecular weight peptides cleaved from the prodynorphin precursor and containing dynorphin B in their sequences (22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Acetic acid extracts from undifferentiated or cardiac lineage-committed ES cells or pooled samples from their incubation media were processed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The collected fractions were radioimmunoassayed, and the immunoreactivity was attributed to authentic dynorphin B by comparison with the elution position of a synthetic standard according to a previously described procedure (24Ventura C. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—The statistical analysis of the data was performed by using a one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman Keul's test and assuming a p value <0.05 as the limit of significance. The glycoconjugates developed in the current investigation are esters between the hydroxyl groups of hyaluronan and the carboxyl group of butyric acid alone (HB), retinoic acid alone (HR), or the ones of both butyric and retinoic acids (HBR). The primary hydroxyl group in position 6 of the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in the polysaccharide backbone is the most reactive toward esterification (Fig. 1). During the study, several HB, HR, and HBR were synthesized to evaluate the relationship between degree of substitution (DS) and pharmacological effect. DS (Fig. 1) was considered as the number of the esterified OH groups for each repeating unit of hyaluronic acid (GlcNAc-GlcUA dimer). All the synthesized HBR exhibited a DSBU ranging between 0.05-1.0, whereas the DSRA was between 0.002-0.1. The DSBU/DSRA ratio was at least 6. The synthesized HR had a DSRA ranging between 0.005-0.2. The synthesized HB had a DSBU ranging between 0.004-0.8. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of these HA esters, referred to as the Mw of sodium hyaluronate, was determined by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography and ranged between 10,000-30,000 in the cases of HR and HBR or between 50,000-85,000 in HB. In the earlier procedure that illustrated the synthesis of HB (25Coradini D. Pellizzaro C. Miglierini G. Daidone M.G. Perbellini A. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 411-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we achieved solubility in DMF by preparing the symcollidinium salt of the D-glucuronic acid carboxylic functions of HA in water medium. Water was subsequently replaced with DMF but could not be totally removed; for this reason the acylating agent was partially hydrolyzed. In this novel synthetic methodology of HA esters, a TBA salt of HA-TBA was prepared; the good solubility of this salt in polar aprotic organic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (26Benedetti L.M. Joshi H.N. Goei L. Hunt J.A. Callegaro L. Stella V.J. Topp E.M. New Polymeric Mater. 1991; 3: 41-48Google Scholar) allows synthesis in an anhydrous and homogeneous reaction system. To increase their nucleophylicity toward retinoylation, the activation of the hydroxyl groups of HA-TBA was carried out by the formation of alcoholates of TBA. Furthermore, treatment with such a strong base as TBA hydroxide has provoked a convenient reduction of the hyaluronan molecular weight and dimension by hydrolysis, thus enhancing its bioavailability and solubility and decreasing the viscosity of its solutions. The esterification (acylation) reactions were accomplished by means of activated reactive forms of butyric acid, precisely the N-acylpyridinium salt (27Höfle G. Steglich W. Vorbrüggen H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1978; 17: 569-583Crossref Scopus (1313) Google Scholar) between butyric anhydride and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, and of retinoic acid, specifically its acyl (retinoyl) chloride (28Maryanoff C. ****. May 10, 1988; (U. S. Patent 4743400)Google Scholar). Retinoylation should take place before butyrylation because of the longer chemical kinetics of the former reaction. Here, HBR was administered to GTR1 cells, a derivative of R1 cells generating late-stage viable tetraploid embryos, and germ line-transmitting chimeras at a remarkable rate (21Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). GTR1 cells contain a transgene encoding the cardiomyocyte-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter driving the puromycin-resistance gene and afford genetic selection of a virtually pure population of ES-derived cardiomyocytes (22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RNase protection analysis revealed that cell treatment with HBR following removal of LIF remarkably increased GATA-4 and Nkx-2.5 mRNA expression in both EBs and puromycin-selected cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2, A and B). These mRNAs encode, respectively, for a zinc finger-containing transcription factor and a homeodomain that have been shown to be essential for cardiogenesis in different animal species (29Biben C. Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 30Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including humans (31Benson D.W. Silberbach G.M. Kavanaugh-McHugh A. Cottrill C. Zhang Y. Riggs S. Smalls O. Johnson M.C. Watson M.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Plowden J. Kugler J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1567-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). HBR also enhanced prodynorphin mRNA expression and the levels of dynorphin B, a natural κ opioid receptor agonist, in both EBs and ES-derived cardiomyocytes and in their incubation media (Fig. 2, C and D). This finding is particularly rewarding because we have recently shown that the prodynorphin gene and dynorphin B primed GATA-4 and Nkx-2.5 transcription (24Ventura C. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and triggered protein kinase C (PKC) signaling through complex subcellular redistribution patterning of targeted PKC isozymes, another major requirement for ES cell commitment to the cardiac lineage (22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Additionally, dynorphin B acted as an agonist of nuclear opioid receptors coupling nuclear PKC activation to the transcription of cardiogenic genes, indicating that intracrine signals for cardiac differentiation may also be fashioned by the prodynorphin gene and its related peptides (23Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-off transcription experiments on nuclei isolated from EBs or puromycin-selected cardiomyocytes revealed that the effects of HBR on GATA-4, Nkx-2.5, and prodynorphin mRNA expression occurred transcriptionally (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that in both GTR1 and the parental R1 cells HBR failed to affect the transcription rate of MyoD and neurogenin-1, two genes involved in skeletal myogenesis and neuronal determination, respectively (Fig. 4). Indeed, the activation of a cardiogenic program of gene transcription was associated with an increase in the expression of the cardiac-specific genes MHC and myosin light chain-2V (Fig. 4). Treatment with 5 μm chelerythrine, a selective PKC inhibitor, following LIF removal and throughout 4 days of puromycin selection abrogated the transcriptional responses elicited by HBR (Fig. 3). Expression of the cardiac-specific transcripts MHC and myosin light chain-2V was concomitantly suppressed (Fig. 4). Similar results were yielded in the presence of 1 μm calphostin C, another PKC inhibitor (not shown). These findings are in keeping with the recruitment of PKC patterning in ES cell cardiogenesis (22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and suggest that PKC-dependent mechanisms may also be involved in HBR action. Whether the differentiating effect of HBR may affect subcellular redistribution and/or gene expression profiling of targeted PKC isozymes is a subject for future investigations.Fig. 4Effect of HBR on non-myocardial and cardiac-specific transcripts. Upper panel, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” after LIF withdrawal GTR1 ES cells (A) or the parental R1 ES cells (B) were committed to myogenesis or neurogenesis in the presence of defined media and treated in the absence (-) or presence (+) of HBR (0.75 mg/ml). Nuclei were isolated from undifferentiated cells (LIF) or cells committed to the selected lineages (EBs) and processed for the nuclear run-off analysis of the indicated transcripts. Row a, transcription of MyoD or neurogenin-1 genes. Row b, cyclophilin mRNA. The right side of each panel reports the position of radiolabeled DNA markers, showing that the single protected fragments migrated with a molecular size comparable with MyoD (425 bases), neurogenin-1 (742 bases), or cyclophilin (270 bases) mRNA. Autoradiograms are representative of six separate experiments. Lower panel, RT-PCR analysis of α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) and myosin light chain-2V (MLC) in EBs and P. Cell collection and treatment without (-) or with (+) HBR or with HBR plus chelerythrine (Chel) were as described in Figs. 2 and 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) HBR did not affect the purity (percentage of MF 20-positive cells) of ES-derived cardiomyocytes (about 99% in untreated cells). MHC expression in cardiomyocytes from HBR-treated cells was further confirmed in immunofluorescence studies (Fig. 5, A-D). Interestingly, HBR exposure elicited a remarkable and dose-dependent increase in the number of spontaneously beating colonies as compared with untreated controls (Fig. 5, E and F). An ester of hyaluronan with RA alone (HR) induced a significantly lower increase in the number of beating colonies as compared with HBR (Fig. 5F). Treatment of EBs with low concentrations of RA between days 5 and 7 has been reported to increase cardiomyocyte differentiation (16Wobus A.M. Kaomei G. Shan J. Wellner M.C. Rohwedel J. Ji G. Fleischmann B. Katus H.A. Hescheler J. Franz W.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1525-1539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although under these experimental conditions 10-8 (or 10-9 not shown), M all-trans RA significantly increased cardiomyocyte yield, the number of spontaneously beating colonies was considerably lower than that detected in HBR-exposed cells (Fig. 5F). Treatment with HA or BU alone only slightly increased the yield of puromycin-selected cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5F). A combined treatment of EBs with HA and RA or with HA and BU resulted in increased cardiomyocyte yield, as compared with the effect elicited by each individual compound, and mimicked the increase in the number of beating colonies observed in the presence of the corresponding hyaluronan monoesters, HR or HB (Fig. 5F). Akin to these observations, cell treatment with an association of HB and HR led to a further increase in the yield of ES-derived cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5F). On the whole, these findings indicate that each of the hyaluronan-grafted moieties in HBR may additively act in a cardiogenic response. Nevertheless, in the presence of HB plus HR the cardiomyocyte yield was still significantly lower than in HBR-treated cells. This observation suggests that a maximal differentiating response is achieved when both BU and RA are concomitantly internalized by the mixed ester. Probably, a competition for the same uptake system of the two monoesters altered an optimal intracellular BU/RA ratio and/or their timely sequence of action. The possibility that HBR uses an HA-related uptake system for cell entry is inferred from the results of competition experiments showing that HA dose-dependently counteracted the cardiogenic action of this glycoconjugate (Fig. 6). Whether an intracellular release of RA and BU may represent a major requirement for the biological activity of HBR or whether it may also act as a bioconjugate remains to be established.Fig. 6Hyaluronan counteracts the cardiogenic action of HBR. From LIF removal throughout 4 days of puromycin selection, cells were exposed to 0.8 mg/ml HBR in the presence of the indicated concentrations of HA (gray bars). The white bar shows the effect of 0.8 mg/ml HA in the absence of HBR. Data (mean ± S.E.; n = 6) are expressed as percentage changes in the number of beating colonies (untreated controls = 100%). *, significantly different from HBR alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Thus, HBR afforded the manipulation of a gene program of cardiogenic and cardio-specific genes, ultimately producing a high throughput of cardiogenesis from mouse ES cells. The finding that specification of a cardiogenic fate was attained without the need of gene transfer technologies makes HBR a novel potential tool for future investigations in ES cell-mediated cardiac rescue. Studies are in progress to shed additional light on the molecular events underlying the differentiating response primed by HBR in ES cells."

Nonetheless, a recent court decision found that the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) must include hatchery salmon in Endangered Species Act listings, where NMFS has included those fish as components of the core evolutionarily significant units (ESUs). This undercuts efforts for restoration of wild salmon. The

 of this Policy Forum, therefore, urge that NMFS use a more legally defensible definition of an ESU; artificially propagated individuals should not be included in ESUs, even if they are indistinguishable at indicator genetic loci. Hatcheries generally reduce current fitness and inhibit future adaptation of natural populations. Hence, the legal definition of an ESU must be unambiguous and must exclude hatchery fish."
https://openalex.org/W2028426734,"The ability of cone photoreceptors to adapt to light is extraordinary. In this study we evaluated two biochemical processes, visual pigment phosphorylation and transducin translocation, for their ability to contribute to light adaptation in zebrafish cones. Since cytoplasmic Ca2+ regulates light adaptation, the sensitivities of these processes to both light and Ca2+ were examined. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ regulates the sites of light-stimulated phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, we found that Ca2+ also regulates the extent of phosphorylation of unbleached cone pigments. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed that neither light nor cytoplasmic Ca2+ influences the localization of transducin in zebrafish cones."

Certain laminin isoforms are predominant in vascular basement membranes and may be critical in maintaining the stability of the mature vessel. On the other hand, formation of new vessels during angiogenesis requires degradation of the basement membrane, exposing the endothelial cells to other laminin isoforms in the surrounding extracellular matrix. We studied the effects of laminin-1 (LN-1) in different in vitro and in vivo models for angiogenesis. LN-1 induced angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane to the same extent as fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and vascular development in embryoid bodies was stimulated in a synergistic manner by FGF-2 and LN-1. LN-1 promoted differentiation of endothelial cells in three-dimensional collagen gels, both in the absence and presence of FGF-2. Formation of tubular structures induced by LN-1 was accompanied by increased expression of Jagged-1, a marker of endothelial differentiation, and increased levels of FGF-2 and FGFR-1 transcripts. LN-1 did not regulate signal transduction pathways known to operate down stream of FGF-2. Thus, phosphorylation of ERK was detected in FGF-2- but not in LN-1-treated cells. Taken together, this suggests that laminins may play a fundamental role in angiogenesis by directly affecting gene and protein expression profiles in endothelial cells.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new vessels from preexisting capillaries, is a prerequisite for embryonic development. In the healthy adult, physiological, regulated angiogenesis is an integral part of tissue growth, wound healing, and the female menstrual cycle. A number of diseases such as cancer and inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, and ischemic heart and limb disease (for reviews, see Refs. 1Griffioen A.W.

These vessels mature by deposition of a new matrix and recruitment of pericytes. Many soluble factors are implicated in regulation of angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) (for a review, see Ref. 5Cross M.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 201-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). It has also been recognized that extracellular matrix interactions are important in angiogenesis, and accordingly, interference with αV integrin function leads to inhibition of angiogenesis (6Brooks P.C.

Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar). Laminins are trimeric molecules composed of α-, β- and γ-chains. Five distinct α-, three β-, and three γ-chains have been identified thus far, and these combine to form at least 14 different laminins (8Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 9Libby R.T. Champliaud M.F. Claudepierre T. Xu Y. Gibbons E.P. Koch M. Burgeson R.E. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6517-6528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, LN-8 (α4β1γ1) and LN-10 (α5β1γ1) are localized in vascular basement membranes (10Doi M. Thyboll J. Kortesmaa J. Jansson K.

LN-α4 -/- mice are viable and fertile but display certain vascular abnormalities, leading to mild transient hemorrhages in the skin of newborn mice (11Thyboll J. Kortesmaa J. Cao R. Soininen R.

Moreover, blood vessel walls in glioblastoma multiforme show increased expression of LN-8 as compared with normal brain (12Ljubimova J.Y. Lakhter A.J. Loksh A. Yong W.H. Riedinger M.S. Miner J.H. Sorokin L.M. Ljubimov A.V. Black K.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5601-5610PubMed Google Scholar). The murine laminin α5 chain is detected only in larger vessels in the embryo, whereas 3-4 weeks after birth, there is prominent expression also in capillaries (13Sorokin L.M. Pausch F. Durbeej M. Ekblom P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 446-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Patton B.L. Miner J.H. Chiu A.Y. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1507-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Targeted inactivation of the gene encoding the laminin α5 chain results in disturbed placental vessel formation and a severe effect on brain and limb development, leading to embryonal death at day 17 (15Miner J.H. Cunningham J. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). LN-1 (α1β1γ1) is expressed during early embryogenesis (16Sasaki T. Giltay R. Talts U. Timpl R. Talts J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in regulation of epithelial as well as EC function. The effect of gene inactivation of the α1 chain has not yet been reported. Targeted inactivation of the γ1 chain gene leads to failure of basement membrane formation and death at embryonic day 5.5 (17Smyth N. Vatansever H.S. Murray P. Meyer M. Frie C. Paulsson M. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) prior to the onset of vasculogenesis. However, because this chain is found in several laminins, the results cannot be used as evidence for a role of laminin-1 in early embryogenesis. LN-1-derived peptides have been shown by Kleinman and co-workers (18Malinda K.M. Nomizu M. Chung M. Delgado M. Kuratomi Y. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. Ponce M.L.

In human colon adenocarcinoma, overexpression of the laminin α1 chain increases vascularization of the tumor, leading to enhanced growth (21De Arcangelis A. Lefebvre O. Mechine-Neuville A. Arnold C.

We now report that LN-1 promotes differentiation of ECs in vitro and angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay. Together with FGF-2, LN-1 synergistically promotes vessel development in embryoid bodies. The molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of LN-1 appears to involve direct gene-regulatory effects, distinct from those induced by angiogenic growth factors. Reagents—LN-1, LN-10/11, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were from Invitrogen. FGF-2 was purchased from Roche Applied Science. In addition, two noncommercial sources of LN-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Rupert Timpl, Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried Munich, Germany and by Dr. Kristofer Rubin, Dept. of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Sweden) were tested. All three LN-1 preparations had the same effects on endothelial cell responses (data not shown). The commercial LN-1 preparation did not contain FGF-2, VEGF-A, or PDGF-BB as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (“Quantikine” kits, catalog no. DVE00 (VEGF-A) and DFB 50 (bFGF), R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; 5 pg detection limit) or by immunoblotting of cells exposed to LN-1 to detect activated growth factor receptors. Moreover, LN-1 did not modulate, either positively or negatively, thymidine incorporation in endothelial cells, indicating that LN-1 preparation did not contain contaminating growth-modulatory factors. The antibody reagents used were: anti-Jagged-1 (sc-11376) and anti-F-actin (sc-1616) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Akt (No. 9272, AKR mouse T-cell lymphoma or protein kinase B), anti-phospho-Akt (No. 9271, Ser 473), anti-ERK-1/-2 (No. 9102) and anti-phoshpo-ERK-1/2 (No. 9101) (Thr-202/Tyr-204, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); anti-mouse CD31 antibody (No. 01591, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit-IgG (NA 934, Amersham Biosciences); HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG (A4174, Sigma); anti-rat IgG antibody (BA 9400); and HRP-conjugated streptavidin (SA-5004, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Tissue Culture and Collagen Gel Assay—Immortomouse brain endothelial (IBE) cells (22Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungstrom M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar) were routinely cultured on gelatin-coated tissue culture plastic in Ham's F12, 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) supplemented with mouse γ-interferon, 20 units/ml. The cells were starved overnight in Ham's F12, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) prior to experiments. Acidified collagen I solution (Vitrogen, Palo Alto, CA) was mixed with 10× concentrated Ham's F12 and neutralizing buffer (260 mm NaCO3, 200 mm HEPES, and 50 mm NaOH) at an 8:1:1 ratio. The mixture was suspended into microwell plates and allowed to polymerize. The cells were trypsinized, washed, mixed with LN-1 and FGF-2 in F12, 0.1% BSA as indicated, and immediately seeded on the collagen gel. Alternatively, LN-1 was administered by mixing with collagen I and added as a thin second layer of collagen gel. The cells were seeded on top of this gel. For morphology studies, a layer of collagen gel containing FGF-2 or not, as indicated, was applied on top of the cells 1.5 h after seeding. The local initial concentration of LN-1 was 100 μg/ml when mixed into a second gel layer and 25 μg/ml when supplemented to the seeding medium, whereas the final concentration was 10 μg/ml. The FGF-2 concentration was 20 ng/ml. Chicken Choriocallanotic Membrane (CAM) Assay—The CAM assay was performed as described previously (23Sasaki T. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. Lindahl U. Hohenester E. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6240-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In brief, fertilized chicken eggs were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 days. A 1 × 1 cm window in the shell was opened over the air sac. Five-mm circular filter paper discs were drained in cortisone acetate (3 μg/ml in 70% ethanol) and dried. FGF-2 (250 ng/disc) and LN-1 (1.25 μg/disc) were added to discs pretreated with cortisone acetate. The discs were applied to the CAMs, and the eggs were incubated for 3 days at 38 °C in a humidified atmosphere. The discs then were excised together with the CAM membrane, which was microphotographed. The scoring from 1 (low) to 4 (high) was based on the number of vessel branch points according to the method of Friedlander (24Friedlander M. Brooks P.C. Shaffer R.W. Kincaid C.M. Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Embryoid Bodies—ES cells from the inner cell mass of blastocysts from the SvJ 129 mouse strain (R1) were a kind gift from Dr. A. Nagy (Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The cells were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 15% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 25 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 19 μm monothioglycerol (Sigma), and 1.0 unit/ml LIF. At day 0, 1200 cells in hanging drops were allowed to aggregate in 20 μl of medium without LIF and, from this point, in the presence or absence of 5 or 20 ng/ml FGF-2. At day 4, individual embryoid bodies (EBs) were placed in polystyrene culture-treated glass slides (BD Biosciences). From day 8 the medium was supplemented as indicated with 1 μg/ml LN-1, and the bodies were cultured until day 12. The time points for FGF-and LN-1 addition were chosen for optimal effects. All treatments were performed on four bodies/condition. For quantification, the area of CD31-positive structures was measured using the “Easy Image” software (Tekno Optik, Stockholm, Sweden). Immunohistochemical Staining—EBs were fixed in 0.5% zinc acetate, 0.5% ZnCl, 0.5% Ca acetate in 0.1 m Tris HCl, pH 7.4, over night. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min, and unspecific binding sites were blocked with blocking buffer (kit NEL 700; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h. EBs were incubated with primary rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody diluted 1:8000 in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C, with secondary, biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG antibody diluted 1:300 in blocking buffer for 1 h, and finally with HRP-conjugated streptavidin diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer for 30 min. The AEC substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) was used for staining according to the manufacturer's instructions. Slides were mounted in aqueous mounting medium (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse E1000 microscope with a Nikon Eclipse DXM 1200 camera. Immunoblotting—The differentiation assay was performed as described above but without the top layer of collagen gel, to allow efficient extraction of cells. At the indicated time points, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed quickly in TBS (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Sample buffer (150 μl 8% SDS, 0.4 m Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue) was applied and left for 1 min, and the sample was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and supplemented with 4% 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using standard procedures. Reverse Transcription PCR—IBE cells on gelatin-coated Petri dishes (800,000 cells/dish) were serum-starved overnight (Ham's F12, 0.1% BSA). Fresh serum-free medium was added with or without FGF-2, 5 ng/ml. After 24 h, RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Alternatively, 800,000 FGF-2-treated cells undergoing tubular morphogenesis in the collagen assay were used. The upper gel layer was removed, and cells were released by collagenase treatment (type IV; 750 μl, 0.1%, Sigma-Aldrich; 20 min, 37 °C), collected, and stored at 4 °C in RNAlater (450 μl, Qiagen) until RNA extraction. Reverse transcription was carried out using Superscript II (Invitrogen), poly(dT) primers, and 2 μg of RNA. The PCR reactions, using primers as indicated in Table I, were performed at 60 °C annealing temperature, except the PCR-reaction for γ3 was carried out using 5 cycles with 66 °C, 5 cycles with 63 °C, and finally 35 cycles with 59 °C.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for PCR (shown in Fig. 4A)GeneForward primer (5′-3′)Reverse primer (5′-3′)Product lengthbpα1GCGCGTAAAGATTTCCAGCCTCTGTCCAAAGCTCCTG626α2GGGTCGGATCAATCATGCTGCGTGGAACATAAGCTTCTCG589α3CGTGGAACATAAGCTTCTCGTTCGGTGGGAAGGAAAGCTG587α4CATGGGATCCTATTGGCCTGCACATAGCCGCCTTCTGTGG664α5CCTGTGCTTGGCCGTGCAAGAAGGAAGGAAGCCGTGGCCATGGAAA437β1GCTGGATCCGCTTGCAGCAGAGTGCAGCTGACGCGAATTCGCTAAGCAGGTGCTGTAAACCG702β2CTGCAGCGGGTATGACTTCCGGCTTGTGCAGCCAGAACAC550β3CAGGTAGATGATGTGGTCGGACTGCGGATCTGCTCCACAC554γ1GCGGGATCCCCAATGACATTCTCAACAACGCAGATATCGGGCTTCTCGA TAGACGGGG760γ2TATTAGCCAGAAGGTTGCGGTAGTCTCCAGCAGATGGAGG549γ3AAAGAGAATGTAGAAGGCAGCAGCAGTCAGATTGGAAAGCAG552 Open table in a new tab Quantitative Real-time PCR—Primers targeting β-actin, Jagged-1, FGF-2, FGFR-1, VEGF-A, VEGFR-2, the five LN α-chains, the LN β1- and LN γ1-chains, and the collagen α1 (IV)-chain (Table II) were designed using Primer Express 1.5a (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and synthesized by Invitrogen.Table IIOligonucleotide primers used for real-time PCR (shown in Fig. 4B)GeneForward primer (5′-3′)Reverse primer (5′-3′)β-ActinCACTATTGGCAACGAGCGGTCCATACCCAAGAAGGAAGGCJagged-1CTCACTCAGGCATGATAAACCCTAGAAGTGGGCAATCCCTGTGTFGF-2GTCACGGAAATACTCCAGTTGGTCCCGTTTTGGATCCGAGTTTFGFR-1CTCCCTACTGGACATCCCCAAACTTCACCGTCTTGGCAGCVEGF-AAAGGAGAGCAGAAGTCCCATGACTCAATTGGACGGCAGTAGCTVEGFR-2ACAGACCCGGCCAAACAATTCCCCCCTGGAAATCCTCLN α1CGGGTCTGTGACGGTAACAGTGCCATCGATTGCGTGTGATLN α2GGAAAAAGGACCCGAGATGTACTTGAGGGTTCCTCACAGGCTGLN α3TCTTGTAGGGTCTGCCCCTGAGCTCCACCATCCACAGCACLN α4CAGCTGGACGACTACAACGCATGGTCGAGGGCCTGGTTALN α5CGGATGGGACCTGTGAAGAGCTCTCCTGTGAAGTTCGGCLN β1CCACTGGCGACCTTCTCATCCTGGTTTGTGCAGTCCACATGLN γ1AAGTCCTGTCACCTGTGCGACCATAGTCTGGCTTTGCCACCACol α1 (IV)GGACCATGGCTTCCTTGTGAGAGCAGAGAGTATCCATGGTAAAGAA Open table in a new tab For RNA preparation and cDNA synthesis, IBE cells cultured on collagen I were lysed in the dish, homogenized through an 0.9-mm syringe, and run through a QIAshredder spin column (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted according to manufacturer's protocol using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Samples were DNase I-treated (Amersham Biosciences), and RNA levels were determined by spectrophotometry. One μg of RNA from each condition was used for reverse transcription (USB, Cleveland, OH) to create cDNA. Reverse transcription PCR parameters were 37 °C for 1 h and 95 °C for 5 min. For the real-time PCR, the ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems) was used with SYBR Green Master mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.25 μm primer. PCR parameters were 95 °C for 10 min (95 °C, 15 s; 60 °C, 60 s) ×45. All samples were run in triplicate, and the level of target gene expression was calculated in relation to the β-actin level in each sample. LN-1 Induces Angiogenesis in CAM—The potential effect of LN-1 on angiogenesis in the chicken embryo was investigated. The CAM of day 10 fertilized chicken eggs was exposed by removal of part of the shell. Filter paper discs soaked in LN-1, FGF-2, or both were applied to the CAM. Three days later, the filter discs were cut out and photographed. Representative CAMs are shown in Fig. 1A. The extent of vessel formation and the morphology of the vessels in the LN-1-treated chicken CAM was similar to that in the FGF-2-treated CAM. There was no appreciable additional increase in vessel formation in the CAMs receiving both FGF-2 and LN-1 (see Fig. 1B for quantification). Similar effects were seen with several different sources of laminin, either commercial or prepared in two different laboratories. The effect was independent of whether LN-1 was in complex with nidogen or not (data not shown). The LN-1 preparation did not contain contaminating growth factors such as FGF-2, VEGF-A, or PDGF-BB, as demonstrated using sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (data not shown). Furthermore, incubation of endothelial cells with high concentrations of LN-1 did not affect the incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Thus, the effects of LN-1 on CAM angiogenesis, or in the models shown below, were not due to contaminating growth modulatory factors in the LN-1 preparations. Synergistic Stimulation of CD31-positive Vessels in Mouse EBs by LN-1 and FGF-2—We next examined the effects of LN-1 on the vascular development in EBs. Mouse embryonic stem cells were aggregated in hanging drop cultures in the absence of LIF. On day 4, the EB aggregates were placed in microscopic chamber slides and further cultured until day 12, when the EBs were fixed and stained with antibodies against CD31 (platelet EC adhesion molecule; Fig. 2A). Cells were treated with or without FGF-2 from day 0 and with or without LN-1 from day 8, at which point angiogenesis was evident in the EBs. There was no effect on vessel formation by addition of 5 ng/ml FGF-2, but treatment with 20 ng/ml FGF-2 increased the number of vessels in the EBs. LN-1 alone did not affect vessel formation at either 1 or 5 μg/ml. Vessel formation in the EBs was efficiently stimulated by a combination of the suboptimal concentration of 5 ng/ml FGF-2 and 1 μg/ml LN-1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, co-stimulation of EBs with 5 ng/ml FGF-2 and 1 μg/ml LN-10/11 did not result in increased vessel formation. The vessels in the FGF-2/LN-1-treated bodies formed a tight capillary plexus-like structure (Fig. 2B). Quantification of the CD31-positive vessel structures showed a synergistic effect of treatment with 5 ng/ml FGF-2 and 1 μg/ml LN-1 (Fig. 2C). LN-1 Induces Tubular Morphogenesis of ECs in Three-dimensional Collagen I Gel—To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the vessel promoting effect of LN-1, we performed tubular morphogenesis assays in the absence and presence of LN-1. IBE cells were seeded on a gel of polymerized type I collagen, treated with LN-1, FGF-2, or both, and embedded in a second layer of collagen I in the continued presence of the different supplements. Formation of tubules was initiated by cells treated with LN-1, FGF-2, or both at 7 h after seeding (Fig. 3). These structures were absent in the cultures devoid of supplement (control). At 24 h, control cells and cells treated with LN-1 only had undergone apoptosis. FGF-2-treated cells showed a network of branching lumen-containing tubules (25Rahmanian M. Pertoft H. Kanda S. Christofferson R. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin P. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Individual cells presented several protrusions that contributed to the branching and the varying thickness of the tubules. Cells treated with both LN-1 and FGF-2 displayed elongated structures of a more uniform thickness with less branching. Individual cells appeared fully integrated in the tubular structures. It is possible that endogenous synthesis and deposition of certain laminin isoforms is critical for FGF-2-induced EC tubular morphogenesis, and we therefore analyzed laminin transcript levels. Cells were seeded on collagen gels and, for reference, on gelatin-coated dishes in the absence and presence of 20 ng/ml FGF-2 and incubated for 24 h. Transcript levels of four α-chains, three β-chains, and three γ-chains were analyzed by PCR (Fig. 4A). Of the α-chains, α1 was not detected and α3 and α5 were expressed at very low levels. FGF-2 treatment slightly increased β3 and γ2 expression, but there was no reproducible difference between the collagen gel and the gelatin-coat cultures in this respect. To further search for transcript regulation of laminin chains during tubular morphogenesis, transcripts levels for the five α-chains and the β1- and γ1-chains, as well as the collagen IV transcripts, were determined at several different early time points by real-time PCR (Fig. 4B). Cells were seeded on collagen gels and treated with or without 20 ng/ml FGF-2 for 1, 3, or 7 h. Transcripts for the α1- and α3-chains were not detected. Immunoblotting confirmed that the ECs did not express the α1 chain (data not shown). FGF-2 treatment increased α5 mRNA levels at 3 h and increased the β1-chain mRNA more than 4-fold at 7 h. This transient increase did not appear to result in increased levels of protein, however. By immunoblotting we were unable to detect increased synthesis or secretion of laminins during tubular morphogenesis (data not shown). To address the question of whether endogenous production of laminins is critical in tubular morphogenesis, human ECs were treated with neutralizing antibodies against laminin-binding integrin α3 and α6. Only marginal inhibition was detected (data not shown). Thus, analysis of laminin transcript levels, protein expression, and function suggested only a small, if any, contribution of changes in the expression levels of endogenous laminins during tubular morphogenesis. Induction of Jagged-1 Expression by LN-1—To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the angiogenic effect of exogenous LN-1, we asked whether LN-1 could modulate expression of angiogenic growth factors FGF-2 and VEGF-A and their receptors and the differentiation marker Jagged-1. Jagged-1 is a ligand for the Notch receptor family, and correct temporal activation of Notch receptors is critical for proper vascular development. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses were performed on RNA isolated from cells treated with FGF-2, LN-1, or a combination of the two for 1, 3, or 7 h (Fig. 5). Treatment with LN-1 led to increased expression levels of Jagged-1 and FGF-2/FGFR-1 at 3 and 7 h, respectively. In contrast, LN-1 did not significantly affect the expression levels of VEGF-A or VEGFR-2. FGF-2 treatment led to increased transcription levels of Jagged-1 at 3 h, to an extent similar to that seen in the LN-1-treated cells. FGF-2 treatment also led to increased expression of both VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 and FGF-2/FGFR-1. For FGF-2 transcription, the effect was dramatic, with a close to 70-fold higher expression levels in the FGF-2-treated cells, indicating a positive autocrine loop. Co-treatment of the IBE cells with FGF-2/LN-1 led to a synergistic increase in Jagged-1 transcripts at 1 and 3 h, but at 7 h the transcript levels were severalfold below that in the control cells. The dramatic effect of FGF-2 on FGF-2 transcript levels was attenuated in cells treated with FGF-2/LN-1. The increase in VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 transcript levels was slightly more pronounced in cells receiving combined treatment for 1 and 3 h compared with FGF-2 alone. Combined treatment led to a decrease at 7 h of FGFR-1, VEGF-A, and VEGFR-2 transcript levels, similar to the effect on Jagged-1 transcript levels. These data indicate fine-tuned regulation of the expression levels of angiogenic modulators in this model. We further analyzed the level of Jagged-1 expression in IBE cells undergoing tubular morphogenesis by immunoblotting. IBE cells on collagen gels were lysed after treatment with FGF-2, LN-1, or both (Fig. 6). Individual treatment with LN-1 and FGF-2 increased expression of Jagged-1 at 3 h after seeding on collagen. Treatment with the combination of LN-1 and FGF-2 further increased the level of Jagged-1 expression. At 7 h, the effect of LN-1 treatment on Jagged-1 expression was essentially lost, whereas the FGF-2 effect remained. Blotting using phosphospecific ERK-1/-2 or phospho-Akt antibodies showed that LN-1 failed to activate these signal transduction components. Treatment with FGF-2 led to induction of phospho-ERK1/2 but not phospho-Akt (Fig. 6). Thus, both real-time PCR and immunoblotting showed that LN-1 alone could promote increased expression levels of Jagged-1, which may be an important mediator of the LN-1 effect on ECs. In this paper, we show that LN-1 stimulates angiogenesis in the chicken CAM and in EBs. Remarkably, LN-1 promoted angiogenesis in the CAM assay to the same extent as FGF-2. We were not able to detect morphological or qualitative differences in the vessels formed by the two stimuli in the CAM or in EBs. This may be due to the presence of complementary endogenous angiogenic factors in these models. Tubular morphogenesis of ECs was promoted by LN-1 alone, accompanied by elevated expression of Jagged-1. We examined whether FGF-2-induced tubular morphogenesis involved endogenous production of laminin by the ECs. We did not detect endogenous production of LN-1 protein or laminin α1 mRNA. We also did not detect FGF-2- or matrix-induced changes in transcript levels at 24 h even though there were transient effects at earlier time points of α5- and β1-chains mRNAs. By immunoblotting for laminin β1- and γ1-chains, we were unable to detect increased secretion of laminins (data not shown). Moreover, blocking antibodies against laminin-binding integrins α3 and α6 did not prevent tubular morphogenesis of human ECs (data not shown). Combined, these data show that LN-1 is not synthesized by the EC model used in this study. Moreover, endogenously produced laminins are not critical in the induction of angiogenesis. We cannot rule out a contribution from endogenous α5-containing laminins or potential novel laminins for which we lack reagents. However, exogenous α5-chain-containing laminin (LN10/11) did not stimulate angiogenesis in the EB model (Fig. 2), which emphasizes the strong influence of LN-1 on in vitro angiogenesis. Jagged-1 is a transmembrane ligand for the Notch family of receptors of which Notch4 is expressed on ECs (26Uyttendaele H. Marazzi G. Wu G. Yan Q. Sassoon D. Kitajewski J. Development. 1996; 122: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both Notch ligands and receptors appear to be restricted to arterial endothelium (27Villa N. Walker L. Lindsell C.E. Gasson J. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Weinmaster G. Mech. Dev. 2001; 108: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the Notch intracellular domain is proteolytically released and translocated to the nucleus to serve as a transcriptional regulator (see Ref. 28Kadesch T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar for a review of Notch signaling). A number of data indicate that appropriate temporal activation of Notch receptors is required for proper vascular development and angiogenesis. Thus, both targeted notch gene inactivation and endothelial overexpression of constitutively activated Notch4 leads to severe vascular defects in mice (29Krebs L.T. Xue Y. Norton C.R. Shutter J.R. Maguire M. Sundberg J.P. Gallahan D. Closson V. Kitajewski J. Callahan R. Smith G.H. Stark K.L. Gridley T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1343-1352PubMed Google Scholar, 30Uyttendaele H. Ho J. Rossant J. Kitajewski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5643-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In vitro studies show that Jagged-1 transcripts are increased during tubular morphogenesis of human umbilical cord ECs (31Bell S.E. Mavila A. Salazar R. Bayless K.J. Kanagala S. Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2755-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of Notch4 and Jagged-1 promote tubular morphogenesis by rat brain EC (32Uyttendaele H. Closson V. Wu G. Roux F. Weinmaster G. Kitajewski J. Microvasc. Res. 2000; 60: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activated Notch4 inhibits in vitro angiogenesis in fibrin gels and in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay (33Leong K.G. Hu X. Li L. Noseda M. Larrivee B. Hull C. Hood L. Wong F. Karsan A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2830-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, maintaining the proper expression levels of Jagged-1 and Notch receptors appears to be vital for EC function. This is in agreement with the transient increase in Jagged-1 transcript and protein levels we observed in the LN-1-treated EC. The level of ERK and Akt phosphorylation was unaffected by LN-1 treatment, indicating that signaling induced by LN-1 does not converge with classical growth factor-induced signaling. Nevertheless, LN-1 treatment up-regulated mRNA levels of FGF-2 and FGFR-1, which may have contributed to the LN-1 activity. Interestingly, cotreatment with LN-1 and FGF-2 changed the mRNA levels of FGF-2, VEGF-A, FGFR-1, and VEGFR-2 in a temporal pattern similar to that observed for Jagged-1, with an early increase and a subsequent drop at 7 h. These data suggest that FGF-2 and VEGF-A signaling may be down-regulated as ECs become more differentiated. Accordingly, FGF-2 and genes regulating FGF-2 signaling are down-regulated in human umbilical cord ECs during differentiation (31Bell S.E. Mavila A. Salazar R. Bayless K.J. Kanagala S. Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2755-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, VEGFR-2 appears to be important primarily in the early phase in angiogenesis and to a lesser extent in the mature vessel (4Papetti M. Herman I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C947-C970Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 34Meduri G. Bausero P. Perrot-Applanat M. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the EB model (Fig. 2), LN-1 treatment alone was not sufficient to induce angiogenesis. However, treatment with a suboptimal level of FGF-2 and a low level of LN-1 together resulted in massive angiogenesis, in a synergistic manner, as strong as treatment with high concentrations of FGF-2. The extent to which exogenous LN-1 was incorporated in vascular basement membranes in the embryoid bodies has not been studied in detail. However, exogenous administration of LN-1 has previously been shown to rescue epithelial development in EBs derived from embryonic stem cells expressing dominant-negative FGFR-2 (35Li X. Chen Y. Scheele S. Arman E. Haffner-Krausz R. Ekblom P. Lonai P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or lacking expression of laminin γ1 (36Aumailley M. Pesch M. Tunggal L. Gaill F. Fassler R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 259-268PubMed Google Scholar) or integrin β1 (37Li S. Harrison D. Carbonetto S. Fassler R. Smyth N. Edgar D. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), all of which are unable to secrete or produce LN-1. Whether these LN-1-deficient EBs still allow vascular development has not been examined. The concept of an angiogenesis-promoting function of LN-1 may be difficult to reconcile with its restricted, preferentially epithelial expression pattern (38Ekblom P. Lonai P. Talts J.F. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, by using sensitive detection methods, a low but rather general tissue expression of LN-1 in the adult mouse was recently reported, in addition to high epithelially derived expression in some tissues (16Sasaki T. Giltay R. Talts U. Timpl R. Talts J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LN-1 was found in sinusoids in liver, indicating a restricted perivascular expression in vivo. Furthermore, during active angiogenesis, the invading angiogenic sprout could become exposed to extravascular LN-1. Lastly, we cannot exclude that LN-1 is mimicking a thus far unidentified pro-angiogenic laminin (containing a putative laminin-α6), which is produced by ECs but not detected by the available reagents. In accordance with a role for LN-1 in promoting angiogenesis, Kleinman and colleague (39Ponce M.L. Kleinman H.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 285: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have identified structurally related proangiogenic peptides derived from the amino termini of the α1- and γ1-chains (denoted A13 and Y16, respectively). Administration of LN-1 and A13 increases tumor growth in an ovarian cancer model in nude mice (40Yoshida Y. Hosokawa K. Dantes A. Kotsuji F. Kleinman H.K. Amsterdam A. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 913-921PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a scrambled and modified version of peptide C16 (C16Y), a potent inhibitor of EC adhesion to LN-1, blocks angiogenesis and tumor growth (41Ponce M.L. Hibino S. Lebioda A.M. Mochizuki M. Nomizu M. Kleinman H.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5060-5064PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, based on data from three angiogenesis models we suggest that: (a) LN-1 may play a more active role in angiogenesis than previously recognized possibly by stabilizing the differentiating vessel; (b) LN-1 induces expression of the differentiation marker Jagged-1 through direct effects on ECs; and (c) LN-1 signaling may converge with FGF-2-signaling to promote angiogenesis.

Pathological overproduction of extracellular matrix components may be linked to the availability of UDP-glucuronic acid; therefore UGDH is an intriguing therapeutic target. Specific inhibition of human UGDH requires detailed knowledge of its catalytic mechanism, which has not been characterized. In this report, we have cloned, expressed, and affinity-purified the human enzyme and determined its steady state kinetic parameters. The human enzyme is active as a hexamer with values for Km and Vmax that agree well with those reported for a bovine homolog. We used crystal coordinates for Streptococcus pyogenes UGDH in complex with NAD+ cofactor and UDP-glucose substrate to generate a model of the enzyme active site. Based on this model, we selected Cys-276 and Lys-279 as likely catalytic residues and converted them to serine and alanine, respectively. Enzymatic activity of C276S and K279A point mutants was not measurable under normal assay conditions. Rate constants measured over several hours demonstrated that K279A continued to turn over, although 250-fold more slowly than wild type enzyme. C276S, however, performed only a single round of oxidation, indicating that it is essential for the second oxidation. This result is consistent with the postulated role of Cys-276 as a catalytic residue and supports its position in the reaction mechanism for the human enzyme. Lys-279 is likely to have a role in positioning active site residues and in maintaining the hexameric quaternary structure.

UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) 1The abbreviations used are: UGDH, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. catalyzes the conversion of UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid, an essential precursor for synthesis of extracellular matrix polysaccharides in numerous diverse species, including humans. The normal cellular functions of UGDH have been studied extensively in various organisms by targeted gene disruptions, and these studies demonstrate its importance in developmental processes. In Drosophila melanogaster, the enzyme is encoded by the sugarless gene and is required for heparan sulfate modification of proteins that control wing formation (1Hacker U. Lin X. Perrimon N. Development. 1997; 124: 3565-3573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, UGDH fuels the production of glycosaminoglycans essential for vulval morphogenesis and embryonic development (2Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14224-14229Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, the enzyme is critical for normal cardiac development (3Walsh E.C. Stainier D.Y. Science. 2001; 293: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and the phenotype of targeted disruption is extremely similar to the murine HAS2 null (4Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T. Biesterfeldt J. Augustine M.L. Calabro Jr., A. Kubalak S. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar); both phenotypes are lethal. Human and mouse HAS2 proteins are 97% identical and are responsible for production of hyaluronan at specific developmental stages (5Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). Because UGDH provides the requisite UDP-glucuronic acid precursor for hyaluronan synthesis, it is not surprising that UGDH null and HAS2 null would exhibit similar developmental impairments. Hyaluronan is an extracellular matrix component that is involved directly in promoting normal cellular growth and migration, but its elevated production has been extensively implicated in the progression of epithelial cancers such as breast (6Auvinen P. Tammi R. Parkkinen J. Tammi M. Agren U. Johansson R. Hirvikoski P. Eskelinen M. Kosma V.M. Am. J.

Int. 2002; 69: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Such elevated synthesis of hyaluronan places increased demand on intracellular UDP-glucuronic acid concentrations, which also must be increased to compensate. Inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis recently has been shown to reduce tumor angiogenesis and thereby restrict in vivo growth of human prostate tumors (9Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M. McCarthy J.B. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 849-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Restriction of precursor availability by inhibition of UGDH may regulate the production of hyaluronan in tumors and therefore is a possible novel avenue for therapeutic intervention. Interestingly, UGDH was identified in breast cancer cells as a gene product dramatically up-regulated in response to elevated androgen (10Lapointe J. Labrie C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4486-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), so an androgen-secreting organ such as the prostate may have a mechanism for increased UGDH expression. Although a clone of human UGDH has been reported (11Spicer A.P. Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. Seldin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25117-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), kinetic properties and detailed mechanistic characterization of the purified enzyme (a necessary prelude to inhibitor design) are not available yet.

Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 407: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) enzymes have been reported. All forms of the enzyme are known to catalyze the same reaction. Two successive oxidations are performed by the enzyme to convert the 6′-hydroxyl of UDP-glucose to a carboxylate concurrent with reduction of 2 mol of NAD+ to NADH. Early experiments to determine an enzyme mechanism in the bovine system preceded the availability of sequence information, so specific catalytic residues were not identified. However, results of these studies led to the interesting mechanism proposed in Scheme 1 in which we have numbered key residues identified in our experiments. According to analysis of the bovine enzyme, in the first step the 6′-carbon of UDP-glucose is thought to be covalently attached in a Schiff base linkage with a lysine residue at the active site of the protein. There is evidence to suggest that this imine undergoes the first oxidation step yielding an aldimine intermediate that is not released from the protein. The aldimine is hydrolyzed/attacked by an active site cysteine to yield a thiohemiacetal that has been detected in both bovine and streptococcal enzyme systems. This intermediate then is oxidized a second time to produce a thioester, which is spontaneously hydrolyzed to release UDP-glucuronic acid as a product. Hydrolysis of the thioester is thought to be rate-limiting overall. Notably, the streptococcal enzyme is believed to form a covalent intermediate specifically between the product of the first oxidation and cysteine 260 within the active site, which is required for the second oxidation. This residue is uniformly conserved across all species and corresponds to cysteine 276 in the human enzyme. In this report, we have cloned, expressed, and purified recombinant human UGDH. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of the human enzyme as well as the first mammalian UGDH to be purified and characterized by site-directed mutagenesis. We have determined that the enzyme is active as a hexamer with some evidence for assembly in a trimer of dimers as has been proposed for the bovine enzyme. Steady state kinetic constants were established and found to be comparable with previously published data in the bovine system. In addition, we generated a structural model of human UGDH based on the published crystal coordinates for the streptococcal homolog. Using this model and primary sequence alignments of known UGDH family members, we selected Cys-276 and Lys-279 as likely active site catalytic residues and converted them to serine and alanine, respectively. Enzymatic activity of C276S and K279A point mutants was not measurable under normal assay conditions. Rate constants were measured over several hours and demonstrated that K279A continued to turn over, although 250-fold more slowly than wild type enzyme. C276S, however, performed only a single round of oxidation indicating that it is essential for the second oxidation. This result is consistent with the postulated role of Cys-276 as a catalytic residue as shown in Scheme 1 and supports its position in the reaction mechanism for the human enzyme. Lys-279 appears to function structurally in preserving both the active site architecture and quaternary structure of the enzyme. Construction of Expression Vectors for Wild Type UGDH and Point Mutants—Reverse-transcribed poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human prostate tumor cells was used as a template for PCR. Oligonucleotides were designed using the published sequence for human UGDH (Gen-Bank™ accession number AF061016) to incorporate an NheI restriction enzyme site immediately prior to the ATG start codon and a SalI site subsequent to the stop codon. The resultant 1.5-kb PCR product was digested with the relevant enzymes and ligated into similarly digested pET28a, a prokaryotic expression vector incorporating a cleavable N-terminal His tag (Novagen). Point mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. Point mutant coding sequences were subcloned in pET28a. All subclones were sequenced by the Genomics Core at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Expression and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant UGDH—The recombinant plasmids encoding N-terminal His6 fusions to UGDH and the point mutants C276S and K279A were used to transform Escherichia coli strain Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). Cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.6-0.8 in 2xYT media containing 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol and 30 mg/liter kanamycin at 30 °C and then were induced for 4 h by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.3m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. All three recombinant proteins were found to be expressed in the soluble fraction. The supernatant was treated with 0.35% (v/v) polyethyleneimine at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g to separate precipitated nucleic acids from the protein-containing soluble fraction. The enzyme then was purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel-chelating column (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Typical yields were 20-40 mg of purified protein per liter of bacterial culture. All preparations were >95% pure based upon SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 1). The purified protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. By comparing uncleaved and thrombin-cleaved protein in the activity assay described below, we investigated whether the N-terminal His tag affected wild type enzyme activity. The His tag was cleaved by incubating the protein with 1 unit/mg thrombin (Novagen) for 1 6 h at 4 °C followed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cleavage of the tag was verified by SDS-PAGE. Cleaved and uncleaved proteins were found to have identical enzymatic activity. Protein storage conditions also were tested, and the protein, although stable at 4 °C for up to 48 h, was only stable long-term at -80 °C following flash freezing in a dry ice/acetone bath. Subsequent characterizations were performed exclusively, therefore, on aliquots of uncleaved protein stored in this fashion. Enzymatic Activity Measurement and Kinetic Characterizations—Enzymatic activity of the wild type enzyme was determined by monitoring the change in absorbance at 340 nm that accompanies the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. For standard screening of enzymatic activity, the assay was performed for 30 s at room temperature in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm UDP-glucose (Fluka) and 10 mm NAD+ (Sigma). The Km and Vmax for UDP-glucose and NAD+ were determined independently using standard assay conditions. Constants for UDP-glucose as substrate were measured by holding NAD+ constant and varying [UDP-glucose] from 0 to 200 μm. Similarly, NAD+ kinetic measurements were made by holding UDP-glucose constant and varying NAD+ from 0 to 2 mm. Triplicate values were obtained for each measurement, and data were plotted with Prism software (GraphPad). Km and Vmax were calculated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation and assuming a single binding site each for substrate and cofactor. Kinetic measurements for the two point mutants initially were made under standard assay conditions, and activity was found to be negligible at the 30-s time point. To determine whether residual enzymatic activity remained in these mutants, assays were set up with saturating cofactor and substrate, and an absorbance scan from 290 to 400 nm was collected every 5 min for 4 h. The resulting A340 values then were replotted over the time course of the assay and analyzed in Prism by fitting to a curve with a one-and two-phase exponential rate for C276S and K279A, respectively, to model the first and second oxidations of NAD+. Determination of Cofactor Binding Constants—To quantify cofactor binding independently of enzyme activity, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured. The wild type protein was scanned to determine the wavelength that gave maximum excitation (290 nm, data not shown); excitation at this value then was used to scan for maximum emission (335 nm). Each of the point mutants was scanned to verify equivalent excitation and emission maxima. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was monitored using these excitation and emission values in the presence of increasing NAD+ from 0 to 1.5 mm. Kd values were obtained for each enzyme by fitting corrected fluorescence quenching to a curve with a single exponential decay (Prism). Molecular Mass Determination—The functional molecular mass of the active UGDH enzyme complex was determined by gel filtration chromatography. Purified recombinant UGDH wild type and point mutants were individually loaded on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) and separated by FPLC in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Size determination was made by comparison with molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences) chromatographed under the same conditions. The molecular mass standards used (see inset plot of Fig. 3) were as follows: thyroglobulin, 699 kDa; ferritin, 416 kDa; catalase, 219 kDa; aldolase, 176 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 47 kDa; chymotrypsinogen A, 20 kDa; RNase A, 15 kDa. Resolution was sufficient to calculate molecular masses unambiguously in multiples of 57 kDa (the calculated molecular mass of monomeric His-tagged UGDH). Homology Modeling and Portrayal of Active Site Residues—Human UGDH is 23% identical to the Streptococcus pyogenes enzyme for which a crystal structure has been published. We modeled human UGDH using 3D-PSSM (27Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar), which superimposed the human amino acid sequence onto the Protein Data Bank coordinates for S. pyogenes UGDH (Protein Data Bank code 1DLI). A ribbon rendering of the model was made with Chimera (28Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Pettersen E.F. Ferrin T.E. Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 1996; 1: 724Google Scholar). The active site was centered upon, and the model, in conjunction with sequence conservation, was used to select appropriate putative catalytic residues, which are depicted in Fig. 4. Protein Expression and Purification—Although the cDNA for human UGDH was expressed previously in eukaryotic cells and the functionality implied by its nomenclature verified, no kinetic data were reported for the enzyme. Our goal was to measure steady state kinetic constants for wild type human UGDH, determine the subunit structure of the active enzyme complex, identify key active site residues, and assess the role of each in the enzyme mechanism. To facilitate these characterizations, wild type UGDH and specific point mutants each were subcloned in a bacterial expression vector that encoded an N-terminal 6-histidine fusion for affinity purification. The resultant constructs expressed abundant soluble recombinant UGDH in E. coli, and each enzyme form was purified to homogeneity by nickel affinity chromatography (Fig. 1). To verify that the N-terminal histidine tag did not affect the structure or function of wild type UGDH or its mutants, the histidine tag was removed by thrombin cleavage, and the resulting protein was compared with uncleaved protein. Because cleaved and uncleaved proteins exhibited identical levels of enzyme activity (data not shown), uncleaved protein was used for subsequent characterizations. Kinetic Characterization of UGDH—UGDH catalyzes conversion of a UDP-glucose substrate to a UDP-glucuronic acid product, concomitantly reducing two molecules of NAD+ to NADH. The enzymatic activity of wild type UGDH was characterized by steady state kinetic analysis. To obtain kinetic constants (Km and Vmax) for substrate and cofactor, we measured the steady state level of NADH by its absorbance at 340 nm. Measurements to determine the dependence of the reaction on cofactor concentration were conducted using purified UGDH incubated with increasing concentrations of NAD+ in the presence of saturating UDP-glucose substrate (Fig. 2A). Similarly, dependence of reaction kinetics on substrate was measured by increasing UDP-glucose concentration in the presence of saturating NAD+ (Fig. 2B). Saturation kinetics were observed for both conditions. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain Km and Vmax for the reaction catalyzed by the wild type enzyme (Table I). Both sets of conditions yielded a similar Vmax of ≈120 nmol of NAD+/min/mg of enzyme. The Km for UDP-glucose was 11.2 μm, and the Km for NAD+ was 355 μm.Table ISteady state kinetic constants for wild type UGDHSubstrateKmVmaxμmnmol/min/mgUDP-glucose11.2 ± 0.28118 ± 1.0NAD+355 ± 12.4128 ± 1.6 Open table in a new tab Characterization of UGDH Oligomeric State—Previous studies with S. pyogenes UGDH indicate that the enzyme is a dimer, but the bovine enzyme is considered to be hexameric. To determine the oligomeric state of human UGDH, we performed size exclusion analysis by FPLC (Fig. 3). Consistent with data for the bovine ortholog, human UGDH predominantly is observed as a hexamer eluting from the gel filtration column at a molecular mass corresponding to six times the single subunit mass (peak I). Significant dimeric (II) and monomeric (III) species also are present, indicating some subunit dissociation. This elution profile was observed repeatedly over several different preparations of the enzyme with relative species ratios conserved so the distribution of subunit structures appears to be an innate property of the enzyme. The inset panel shows molecular weight determination for the peaks on the basis of size exclusion standards. The functional enzyme was analyzed independently by dynamic light scattering (data not shown), which estimated its molecular mass at 345 kDa (hydrodynamic radius of 7.2 nm) consistent with a hexameric assembly of the 57-kDa monomers. Determination of UGDH Cofactor Binding Affinity—To characterize the initial binding of NAD+ cofactor to UGDH independently of its apparent binding during 2-fold oxidation in turnover, we monitored the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of UGDH. We determined that fluorescence emission of the protein at 335 nm was quenched by the incremental addition of NAD+ (data not shown). Tryptophan quenching was plotted as a function of NAD+ concentration and fitted to an exponential decay assuming a single binding site (Prism). The resulting dissociation constant was 118 ± 3.3 μm (Table II). This value is comparable in order of magnitude to the Km for NAD+ determined by catalytic turnover.Table IINAD+ binding constants for wild type and mutant UGDHEnzymeKdμmUGDH118 ± 3.3C276S127 ± 4.0K279A103 ± 3.0 Open table in a new tab Homology Modeling of UGDH—The structure for human UGDH has not been solved yet, but the human enzyme is 23% identical to its ortholog in S. pyogenes for which a structure was recently published. Using the coordinates of the bacterial enzyme complexed with cofactor and substrate, we modeled the human enzyme as a ternary complex with NAD+ cofactor and UDP-glucose substrate and inspected the architecture of the active site (Fig. 4). The degree of structural similarity was sufficient to identify specific residues in the human enzyme likely to participate in catalysis. Cys-260 of the streptococcal UGDH was mutagenized previously and found to reduce enzyme activity. Based on the homology model of human UGDH and previously published studies of the bacterial enzyme, we identified specific residues within the active site that were likely to be important for catalytic activity. We generated point mutations at residues Cys-276 (the human analog of Cys-260) and Lys-279 to investigate their individual contributions to the enzyme mechanism. Fig. 4 illustrates the position of these two residues in the active site of the human UGDH model relative to NAD+ and UDP-glucose. Also shown are side chains of residues Lys-220 and Asp-280 (see “Discussion”). Kinetic Characterization of UGDH Point Mutants—Catalytic activity of UGDH point mutants C276S and K279A initially was measured under standard reaction conditions and found to be negligible. For C276S, this observation is consistent with results of the analogous C260S streptococcal point mutant, which lacked activity to an unquantified degree. To evaluate the role of each residue in catalysis and determine the extent of impaired catalytic function, we performed a time course over 4 h, measuring enzyme activity every 5 min by absorbance wavelength scans from 290 to 400 nm. Conversion of NAD+ to NADH by C276S (Fig. 5A) was found to saturate at a concentration equimolar to that of added protein, suggesting that a single round of oxidation can occur in the absence of this cysteine but that the cysteine is essential for the second oxidation. In contrast, cofactor reduction was not saturable in the reaction catalyzed by the K279A mutant (Fig. 5B), demonstrating its continued capacity for multiple turnover. Absorbance values at 340 nm were replotted as a function of assay time to determine kinetic constants for the reaction (Fig. 5C). As mentioned above, values for C276S were observed to plateau at an A340 of ≈0.17. This absorbance value corresponds to a 1:1 molar ratio of NADH produced relative to added protein. Under identical conditions, K279A continued to turn over without reaching an end point. Saturable C276S kinetic data were fitted to an equation with a single rate for catalysis of ≈2.7 nmol of NAD+/min/mg of enzyme (Table III). This value is ∼50-fold diminished from the overall rate of NAD+ turnover by wild type enzyme. Cys-276 therefore is not only essential for the second round of oxidation; it is also involved in efficient execution of the first round. Data replotted for K279A, which did not achieve saturation in the time course of the assay, revealed two rate constants. The first, k1, was comparable with the rate constant for C276S (≈2.5 nmol/min/mg), but was followed by a much slower rate, k2, of ≈0.4 nmol/min/mg. Hence, although not directly required for either oxidation, Lys-279 appears to have a global role in the catalytic function.Table IIIRate constants for wild type and mutant UGDHEnzymek1k2mol/min/mgnmol/min/mgUGDH110.7 ± 1.45C276S2.69 ± 0.19No activityK279A2.47 ± 0.110.396 ± 0.066 Open table in a new tab Cofactor Binding by Wild Type and Mutant UGDH—To verify that observed differences in enzyme activity among wild type and point mutants of UGDH were not attributable to a loss of cofactor binding, we compared intrinsic tryptophan quenching in the presence of increasing concentrations of NAD+. Fluorescence emission was fitted to a saturation curve assuming a single binding site. Resultant dissociation constants (Table II) demonstrate comparable cofactor affinities among wild type and mutant UGDH (118, 127, and 103 μm for wild type, C276S, and K279A, respectively), suggesting that the folded structures of the mutant proteins were unaffected by the respective point mutation. Furthermore, loss of enzymatic activity was not the result of a change in binding of NAD+ by either mutant despite the suggestive hydrogen bonding proximities illustrated by Fig. 4 that might implicate Lys-279 in cofactor binding. Subunit Association of Mutant UGDH—Because altered catalytic activity of the mutants also could result from changes in quaternary structure, the oligomeric state of the mutant enzymes was examined for perturbations by size exclusion FPLC. Whereas C276S retained a predominantly hexameric structure with a minor dimeric peak as compared by overlay of its elution profile on that of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 6A), K279A is found almost exclusively as a dimer (Fig. 6B). This observation is consistent with the UGDH quaternary structure adopting a “trimer of dimers” arrangement within the hexameric protein. Although the homology model of UGDH does not predict a surface exposed location for Lys-279, it appears to be required for maintenance of the trimer interfaces that must occur independently of dimerization. UGDH is expressed by most species from bacteria to humans. In plants and bacteria, its role is in the maintenance of structural integrity. In animals, its functional significance is developmental, and its dysregulation is linked indirectly to several pathologies, including cancer progression. Specific targeted inhibition of this enzyme may offer a therapeutic avenue but requires a detailed understanding of its mechanism. To date, most mechanistic studies have focused on the bovine or bacterial forms of the enzyme. In the study we have presented here, human UGDH was cloned, expressed, and purified to homogeneity. We report the first characterization of its mechanistic features. Kinetic properties of the hexameric enzyme are comparable with those reported previously for UGDH orthologs. Specific point mutants were generated based on homology modeling of the enzyme and used to dissect the components of the enzyme reaction sequence. Cys-276 is required for the second but not the first of the two successive oxidations. Lys-279 is not an absolute requirement for activity, but mutation of this residue impairs catalysis and disrupts the quaternary structure of the protein. Its role probably is to position the active site cysteine for maximally efficient catalysis, but it may also be an important contact at the trimeric interface. Human UGDH is closely related to the enzyme characterized from bovine liver but is only 23% identical to the S. pyogenes enzyme, both of which catalyze the same 2-fold oxidation of UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid, apparently by similar mechanisms. Not surprisingly, the kinetic activity and quaternary structure of the wild type human protein are very similar to the bovine; the kinetic constants we have measured are within 2-fold of those reported for the bovine enzyme, which also functions as a hexamer (16Schiller J.G. Bowser A.M. Feingold D.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1972; 25: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The S. pyogenes enzyme, in contrast, is dimeric and has slightly lower binding constants for substrate and cofactor relative to both mammalian proteins (23Campbell R.E. Mosimann S.C. van De Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Strynadka N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7012-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is not clear what role subunit associations may play in enzyme function. Both substrate binding assays and chemical modifications of the active site cysteines in the bovine enzyme suggest that there is half-site reactivity among the subunits in the trimer of dimers that is induced through subunit communication following the first binding event (17Franzen J.S. Ashcom J. Marchetti P. Cardamone Jr., J.J. Feingold D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 242-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Franzen J.S. Kuo I. Eichler A.J. Feingold D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 50: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This phenomenon may provide a regulatory mode for human and bovine UGDH. Although it is possible that the reduced activity of our K279A mutant is attributable to its altered subunit structure, we have additionally generated a point mutant, K339A, that also is dimeric but exhibits activity comparable with that of wild type (data not shown). Lys-279 is shown by the homology model to be located in a solvent-exposed stretch of helix adjacent to the dimerization interface. Evolutionarily speaking, the hypothesis has been put forth that the bacterial enzyme preceded the animal forms (11Spicer A.P. Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. Seldin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25117-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The dimer interface then most likely would be conserved among species, and the contacts between dimers would be elsewhere. The quaternary structures of our lysine mutants are consistent with conserved localization of the dimer interface and predict that interdimer association occurs through contacts maintained, at least in part, by the solvent-exposed helix containing Lys-279. Site-directed mutagenesis is a powerful tool with which to functionally dissect the roles of residues within an enzyme active site. To date, only one such study has been done; cysteine 260 of S. pyogenes UGDH was converted to a serine, and the mutant lost activity but no quantitative data were published (24Ge X. Campbell R.E. van De Rijn I. Tanner M.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6613-6614Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Active site residues in the bovine enzyme have been identified by chemical modifications only. We sought to acquire mechanistic details for the human enzyme by a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, activity measurements, and homology modeling. Although only 23% identical to bacterial UGDH, the sequence of the human enzyme mapped well onto the crystal coordinates determined for the bacterial enzyme. By modeling the protein in this fashion, we were able to generate an image of the putative interactions within the active site of a ternary complex composed of human UGDH, NAD+ cofactor, and UDP-glucose substrate (Fig. 4). Inspection of this model, combined with identification of conserved residues in a primary sequence alignment of UGDH across diverse species and consideration of published data for the bovine and bacterial enzymes, directed us toward the selection of two key conserved amino acid residues likely to have a role in the catalytic mechanism: Cys-276 and Lys-279. The figure illustrates a network of hydrogen bonding interactions within the active site that may serve to stabilize the ternary complex and facilitate catalysis. Lys-279 appears to bind the 3′-hydroxyl of the NAD+ ribose (though mutation of that residue had no effect on our NAD+ binding data) and forms an electrostatic interaction with Asp-280. Asp-280, in turn, positions a water molecule at the active site, thereby indirectly linking to NAD+, the 6′-OH of the substrate, and Cys-276. This water molecule may be a structural edifice or a component of the reaction mechanism. It has been suggested that the water molecule would serve as a general base for proton abstraction during the first oxidation step in the bacterial reaction scheme (23Campbell R.E. Mosimann S.C. van De Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Strynadka N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7012-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Its central location at the active site then would be important to preserve and would depend on interactions donated by Lys-279 and Cys-276, but our data do not address this directly. The cysteine thiol thus positioned is within hydrogen bonding distance of the 6′-hydroxyl of UDP-glucose and is located appropriately for catalysis. The mechanism proposed for bacterial UGDH involves the production of UDP-hexodialdose as an intermediate (21Campbell R.E. Sala R.F. van de Rijn I. Tanner M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3416-3422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Catalysis then is postulated to proceed via formation of a thiohemiacetal between Cys-276 and this intermediate, which is oxidized to a thioester before hydrolysis to yield the final carboxylate product. Our data demonstrate that Cys-276 is capable of a single NAD+ reduction, which is consistent with this hypothesis. However, the hexodialdose intermediate never has been isolated either from the bacterial or the bovine reaction system. Instead, investigators of the bovine system postulated a reaction intermediate that was covalently linked to the enzyme and not released between oxidations (14Ordman A.B. Kirkwood S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1320-1326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ordman and Kirkwood (14Ordman A.B. Kirkwood S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1320-1326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) hypothesized a Schiff base intermediate that would be linked via an active site lysine. To demonstrate this and identify the enzyme residue linkage, these authors derivatized the putative active lysine with [14C]formaldehyde and reduced with NaBH4, thereby placing a mechanism-dependent label at the active site. These studies clearly suggest that the enzyme first forms a Schiff base linkage with the 6′-carbon of UDP-glucose, allowing the C-6′-hydroxyl subsequently to undergo the first oxidation, as we have depicted in Scheme 1. Our data using C276S also are consistent with this scheme. Interestingly, although Lys-279 appeared to be important for maximally efficient catalysis, its role is probably indirect: to constrain the position of an essential catalytic residue or the active site water. Accordingly, we have mutagenized an additional lysine, K220A 22B. J. Sommer, J. J. Barycki, and M. A. Simpson, manuscript in preparation., which entirely lacks enzymatic activity, implying that Lys-220 is an essential catalyst for the first oxidation of UDP-glucose and highlighting it as a candidate for the Schiff base intermediate. The collective summary of the studies described suggests to us the reaction mechanism as outlined in Scheme 1 with key residues we have identified illustrated in their respective roles. The reaction sequence is initiated by the binding of UDP-glucose, followed by NAD+. Lys-220 forms a covalent linkage to the C-6′ of UDP-glucose, the hydroxyl is lost as water, and the secondary amine is oxidized to a Schiff base between C-6′ and Lys-220, releasing NADH. The thiol of Cys-276 simultaneously attacks C-6′ as water hydrolyzes the Schiff base, forming a thiohemiacetal that is oxidized by reduction of a second NAD+ to the thioester. Hydrolysis of the thioester releases the final UDP-glucuronic acid product. The mechanism suggests that specific inhibitors may be most effective at the level of Schiff base or thiohemiacetal formation because these would exploit the retention of covalent intermediates by the enzyme and be mechanistic inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2026592735,"AE1 facilitates Cl−/HCO3− exchange across the erythrocyte membrane. To identify residues involved in substrate selection and translocation, we prepared an array of single cysteine mutants in an otherwise cysteineless background. These mutants spanning the C-terminal portion of the AE1 membrane domain from Phe806-Cys885 were characterized for functional activity when expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells by measurement of changes of intracellular pH associated with bicarbonate transport. To identify residues involved in substrate translocation, transport activity was assessed for each mutant before and after treatment with the following sulfhydryl reagents: anionic para-chloromercuibenzenesulfonate; permeant (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate; and cationic [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET). Among the 80 mutants, only certain key residues in the Val849-Leu863 region were inhibited by the sulfhydryl reagent, consistent with direct involvement of these sites in anion transport. In the last two transmembrane segments, only mutants in the extracellular portion of the transmembrane segments could be inhibited by sulfhydryl reagent, suggesting that the outer portions line the translocation channel and the inner portions have some other role. Sensitivity to cationic MTSET and effects of Cl- identified the substrate charge filter as Ser852-Leu857. AE1 facilitates Cl−/HCO3− exchange across the erythrocyte membrane.

Removal of waste CO2 from the body is equally important as the uptake of O2. High CO2 levels cause tissue acidosis and depress central nervous system function (1Silverthorn D.U. Human Physiology, an Integral Approach. 2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ2001: 443-541Google Scholar). CO2 is transported mainly as HCO3− in the blood (∼90%). Conversion of CO2 to HCO3− benefits the body in two ways: 1) enhancement of blood capacity to carry CO2 and 2) pH buffering to stabilize the pH value of the body. The human anion exchanger 1 (AE1, 1The abbreviations used are: AE1, anion exchanger 1; AE1C-, cysteineless AE1; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-(5 and 6)-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MTSEA, (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate; pCMBS, para-chloromercuibenzenesulfonate; TM, transmembrane segment; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone. also called SLC4A1 or Band 3) plays a critical role in the CO2 transport system. In the systemic capillaries, the high CO2 partial pressure drives CO2 diffusion into the erythrocyte where it is converted to HCO3−. HCO3− is then transported out of the erythrocyte by AE1 in exchange for Cl- to prevent mass action from slowing the process. When the blood reaches the lung, the process is reversed and CO2 is exhaled from the body. With a turnover rate of 5 × 104 anions S-1, AE1 rapidly performs tightly coupled one to one electroneutral exchange of Cl- for HCO3− across the plasma membrane, placing AE1 among the fastest membrane transport proteins (2Brahm J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 283-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Transport is especially rapid because AE1 is the most abundant integral membrane protein of the erythrocyte membrane (1.2 × 106 copies/cell and 50% of integral membrane protein) (3Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6176) Google Scholar). AE1 has additional roles in erythrocyte biology. AE1 interacts with the cytoskeleton via ankyrin to maintain the flexible biconcave disc shape of the erythrocyte (4Jay D.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 853-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In aged erythrocytes, AE1 serves as the senescence antigen for clearance from circulation (5Low P.S. Waugh S.M. Drenckhahn D. Science. 1985; 227: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 6Kay M.M. Wyant T. Goodman J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 719: 419-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). AE1 also participates in the adhesion of malaria-infected erythrocytes to endothelial cells (7Crandall I. Collins W.E. Gysin J. Sherman I.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4703-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) as well as a host receptor for the Plasmodium falciparum invasion of erythrocytes (8Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H.

Mutation or deletion of the AE1 gene induces blood group antigens, variant erythrocyte morphologies, and human diseases including the Diegoa blood group antigen (9Bruce L.J. Anstee D.J. Spring F.A.

Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 1999; 12: 637-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). AE1-deficient mice display retarded growth, hemolytic anemia, and a high rate of neonatal death (12Peters L.L. Shivdasani R.A. Liu S.C. Hanspal M. John K.M. Gonzalez J.M. Brugnara C. Gwynn B.

AE1 functions in erythrocytes, and an N-terminally truncated form is in the kidney. AE2 is the housekeeping anion exchanger found in a variety of tissues. AE3 is expressed in heart, brain, and retina. The three AE isoforms have high sequence conservation in their membrane domains and lower conservation in their cytoplasmic domains. Human AE1 is a 110-kDa glycosylated integral membrane protein composed of 911 amino acids. It exists as a homodimer in the lipid bilayer, but each monomer performs anion exchange activity independently (13Jennings M.L. Passow H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 554: 498-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The 45-kDa cytoplasmic domain of AE1 whose structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography forms the anchoring sites for cytosolic proteins including hemoglobin, glycolytic enzymes, and ankyrin, which anchors AE1 to the underlying cytoskeleton (14Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane domain performs anion transport alone (15Lepke S. Passow H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 455: 353-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes from the AE1 knockout mouse showed continuous loss of the plasma membrane by forming rodlike blebs (12Peters L.L. Shivdasani R.A. Liu S.C. Hanspal M. John K.M. Gonzalez J.M. Brugnara C. Gwynn B. Mohandas N. Alper S.L. Orkin S.H. Lux S.E. Cell. 1996; 86: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Recently, AE1 was shown to be part of a large macromolecular complex in the erythrocyte membrane with Rh protein and other membrane proteins (16Bruce L.J. Beckmann R. Ribeiro M.L. Peters L.L. Chasis J.A. Delaunay J. Mohandas N. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). AE1 functions by a ping-pong mechanism to exchange Cl- and HCO3− across the plasma membrane (17Frohlich O. Gunn R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 169-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The ping-pong model proposes that AE1 has a flexible transport site that undergoes conformation change to face extracellular and intracellular surfaces alternately (17Frohlich O. Gunn R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 169-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Extensive studies of the anion transport site demonstrate that it has distinct inward and outward facing conformations (18Jennings M.L. Whitlock J. Shinde A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three-dimensional (19Wang D.N. Sarabia V.E. Reithmeier R.A. Kuhlbrandt W.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) cryoelectron microscopy structures are available for the membrane domain of AE1 at a 20-Å resolution. The C-terminal region of AE1 has been proposed to be involved in the anion translocation mechanism for many years. Two anion exchange inhibitors, pyridoxal phosphate and DIDS, both react with Lys851 in this region to inhibit the transport activity (21Kawano Y. Okubo K. Tokunaga F. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8232-8238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Okubo K. Kang D. Hamasaki N. Jennings M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1918-1926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation, P868L, causes acanthocytosis and substantially increases anion exchange activity (23Bruce L.J. Kay M.M. Lawrence C. Tanner M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Histidine 834 has been identified as undergoing conformational changes close to the anion translocation site (24Jin X.R. Abe Y. Li C.Y. Hamasaki N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12927-12932Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Carbonic anhydrase binds to the C-terminal cytoplasmic region via the LDADD motif, forming a metabolon to facilitate HCO3− transport (25Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Sterling D. Reithmeier R.A. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47886-47894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). These studies implicate the C-terminal region as the anion translocation site. We recently determined the topology of the C-terminal region of human AE1 using a panel of individual introduced cysteine mutants probed with permeant and impermeant sulfhydryl reagents (27Zhu Q. Lee D.W. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3112-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The last two TMs were shorter than a standard TM composed of only 16 amino acids each and were connected by a small extracellular loop. In this paper, we have assessed that the sensitivity of AE1-introduced cysteine mutants to functional inhibition by small hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents to identify the residues in this region that form the anion selectivity filter and that line the anion translocation pore. A preliminary version of this work has been published as an abstract previously (28Zhu Q. Casey J.R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: A465Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar).

Cloning and Expression of Introduced Cysteine Mutants—The cloning strategy for the introduced cysteine mutations has been described previously (27Zhu Q. Lee D.W. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3112-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Mutant AE1 cDNAs were expressed by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK) as described previously (29Tang X.B. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HEK cells were plated onto 60-mm dishes in 4-ml DMEM containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 5% (v/v) calf serum (Invitrogen). 6-8 h following seeding, cells were transfected with mutant plasmids using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (29Tang X.B.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were then grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and harvested 48 h post-transfection. Transfected HEK cells were washed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and allowed to deplate in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were collected, sedimented, and lysed with 200 μl of IPB buffer (1% (v/v) Igepal (Nonidet P-40 detergent), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 200 μm TPCK, 200 μm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 10 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 7500 × g for 1 min. Supernatants were mixed with 2× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Samples were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were incubated in 10 ml of TBSTM (Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk powder (Carnation)) containing 3 μl of monoclonal anti-AE1 antibody, IVF12 (31Jennings M.L. Anderson M.P. Monaghan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for 12-16 h at 4 °C. After washing, blots were probed with 10 ml of 1:3000 diluted horseradish peroxidase conjugated to sheep anti-mouse IgG in TBSTM and subsequently processed with ECL reagent and visualized using a Kodak Image Station 440CF. Anion Exchange Assays with Sulfhydryl-reactive Reagents—HEK 293 cells were grown on polylysine-coated glass coverslips in 60-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected as above. Two days post-transfection, cells were rinsed with serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen) and incubated in 4 ml of serum-free DMEM containing 2 μm BCECF-AM (37 °C, 30 min). Coverslips were mounted in a fluorescence cuvette and perfused at 3.5 ml/min alternately with Ringer's buffer (5 mm glucose, 5 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm calcium gluconate, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4,25mm NaHCO3,10mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing either 140 mm sodium chloride (chloride buffer) or 140 mm sodium gluconate (chloride-free buffer). Both buffers were bubbled continuously with air containing 5% carbon dioxide. Intracellular pH was monitored by measuring fluorescence changes at excitation wavelengths of 440 and 502 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm in a Photon Technologies International RCR/Delta Scan spectrofluorometer. Intracellular pH was calibrated using the nigericin-high potassium method (32Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar) with three pH values between 6.5 and 7.5. Transport rates were determined by linear regression of the initial linear rate of change of pH using Sigma plot software. Anion exchange activity was measured by 1) perfusion with Cl- containing Ringer's buffer until pH was stable, 2) perfusion with Cl--free Ringer's buffer until stable alkalinization was reached, 3) perfusion with Cl- containing Ringer's buffer until pH stabilized, and 4) perfusion with Cl--free Ringer's buffer until stable alkalinization was reached. Cells were then perfused with 10 ml of Cl--free Ringer's buffer containing 500 μm pCMBS, 5 mm MTSEA, or 5 mm MTSET and incubated for 10 min followed by washing with Cl--free Ringer's buffer for 10 min. A shutter was placed in the light path to prevent possible decomposition of pCMBS under high intensity light. Cells were then perfused with Cl- containing Cl--free and Cl--containing Ringer's buffer to re-assess transport rates. Inhibition of anion exchange was determined by comparison of the initial 100-s rates of alkalinization and acidification before and after incubation with sulfhydryl reagent. Statistical Analysis—Means ± S.E. were calculated with Kaleidograph 3.5 software (Synergy Software). Statistical analysis was performed using Kaleidograph 3.5 software. Student's paired t test was used to assess statistical significance with p < 0.05 considered significant. Effect of Introduced Cysteine Mutations on AE1 Transport Activity—To identify amino acids involved in the AE1 anion translocation process, we constructed 80 individual cysteine mutations consecutively introduced into a cysteineless human AE1 cDNA at all of the positions between Phe806 and Cys885 in the C-terminal region of human AE1. Cysteineless AE1 cDNA was constructed previously, and mutant protein is fully functional (33Casey J.R. Ding Y. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mutant AE1 proteins were expressed in HEK 293 cells by transient transfection. All of the proteins were well expressed to similar levels as shown on immunoblots probed with IVF12 antibody, which recognizes the extreme C-terminal tail (Fig. 1) (31Jennings M.L. Anderson M.P. Monaghan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transport activity of each mutant protein was assessed by monitoring intracellular pH changes associated with HCO3− exchange in a whole cell assay (27Zhu Q. Lee D.W. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3112-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the introduced cysteine mutations impaired transport activity to varying degrees. Among 80 introduced cysteine mutant proteins, 15 had <20% transport activity compared with the cysteineless AE1 protein and were thus defined as functionally inactive (27Zhu Q. Lee D.W. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3112-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there are five functionally inactive mutants (M833C, H834C, F836C, T837C, and Q840C) clustered at the N-terminal end of the second last transmembrane helix, which suggested that this region is critical for the proper folding of the last two transmembrane helices. Mutation of Lys851, which reacts with both pyridoxal phosphate and DIDS to inhibit anion transport, also inactivated transport function, highlighting the importance of this residue.Fig. 2Position of introduced cysteine mutations in the topology model of human AE1 and their relative anion exchange activity. A, the model was recently proposed on the basis of cysteine-scanning mutagenesis (27Zhu Q. Lee D.W. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3112-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Dashed box highlights the region shown at a larger scale in B. Transport activity of each mutant protein was assayed by measurement of pH changes associated with bicarbonate transport. Transport activity is expressed as activity relative to the human AE1C- mutant. Black, <20% AE1C- activity; dark gray, 20-60% AE1C- activity; light gray, >60% AE1C- activity (27Zhu Q. Lee D.W.

Branched structure at amino acid 642 represents the single site of N-linked glycosylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Eight AE1 Mutant Proteins Were Functionally Inhibited by the Membrane-impermeant Reagent, pCMBS—Data from many studies have implicated the C-terminal portion of AE1 membrane domain as critical for ion translocation (34Passow H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 103: 61-223PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jennings M.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 397-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To identify the residues that form the anion translocation pore in this region, we examined the sensitivity of all of the introduced cysteine mutants to small hydrophilic, covalently acting sulfhydryl-reagents (Fig. 3). If an introduced cysteine residue is in the anion translocation pore, covalent modification with any of these compounds will block the substrate pathway and thus sterically inactivate the transport activity. To determine the effect of sulfhydryl reagents, transport assays were performed before and after treatment with sulfhydryl reagents. pCMBS is a negatively charged membrane-impermeant reagent that has been widely applied to probe membrane transport protein structure (36Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3498-3503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 provides an example of the effects of pCMBS on AE1 proteins. AE1C- was insensitive to pCMBS, as expected because it does not contain any cysteine residues. In contrast, L863C transport activity was greatly reduced by pCMBS, as seen by the reduction in the rate of pH change associated with HCO3− transport, following pCMBS treatment. We note that during the 10-min incubation period with pCMBS, the cytosol acidified to some degree (Fig. 4, A and B). The basis for this effect is unclear. However, upon pCMBS washout with Ringer's buffer, pH returned to a base line very close to the starting level. The fact that pCMBS did not have any effect on AE1C- lends support to the idea that the pH drift during pCMBS incubation did not affect the ability to measure effects of pCMBS covalent modification on the activity of AE1-introduced cysteine mutants. Among the 65 functionally active introduced cysteine mutants analyzed, only eight mutants (V849C, V850C, T853C, L857C, A858C F861C, V862C, and L863C) were inhibited by pCMBS (Fig. 5). V850C and L863C achieved the maximum effect with inhibition by pCMBS >70%, suggesting that these residues line the anion translocation pore. All of the sensitive residues are hydrophobic, consistent with TM8 of AE1 in which the lining of the pore is hydrophobic (37Tang X.B. Kovacs M. Sterling D. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3557-3564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these residues lie at the extracellular ends of the last two transmembrane helices and the small extracellular connecting loop (Fig. 2). In addition to the pCMBS-inhibited mutants, some other mutants had anion exchange activity that was slightly increased by pCMBS. Small increases in activity following treatment with sulfhydryl reagents have been reported in studies of introduced cysteine mutants of both transporters and ion channels (38Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 39Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and may reflect effects on cells rather than the protein itself. The Val849 and Leu863 Region Is Sensitive to Inhibition by Both pCMBS and MTSEA—To explore further whether any of the residues close to the intracellular side of the protein may line the translocation pore, we scanned all of the functional cysteine mutants for sensitivity to the sulfhydryl reagent, MTSEA. The pKa of MTSEA is 8.5 (40Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) so that a significant fraction of the reagent is unprotonated and neutrally charged in the pH range of transport assays (pH 7.2-7.8). Unprotonated MTSEA is thus membrane-permeant (41Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As found for pCMBS, eight residues in the Val849-Leu863 region were inhibited by MTSEA (Fig. 6). Among them, six were also inhibited by pCMBS (V849C, V850C, T853C, L857C, A858C, and I863C). Two other mutants (S852C and A855C) were inhibited by MTSEA but not pCMBS. Conversely, F861C and V862C were inhibited by pCMBS but insensitive to MTSEA. Strikingly, in the entire region scanned for sensitivity to sulfhydryl reagents, Phe806-Cys885, all of the pCMBS and MTSEA-sensitive mutants clustered narrowly between Val849 and Leu863. The maximum transport inhibition by MTSEA was less than that for pCMBS by only ∼30%. This is may be explained by the covalent moiety of MTSEA, which is smaller than that of pCMBS. Alternatively, anionic pCMBS may have greater access to these sites than neutral/cationic MTSEA. Positively Charged MTSET Inhibits Mutants Only in the Extracellular Loop Region—Human AE1 will transport a wide range of anionic substrates with strong selectivity against cations (35Jennings M.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 397-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 42Jones G.S. Knauf P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 86: 721-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the ClC Cl- channel whose structure may serve as a guide for an anion transporter like AE1, the anion selectivity filter is formed by four residues at the ends of different helices (43Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). To examine whether the Val849-Leu863 region similarly forms the anion selectivity filter, we tested the effect of a cationic sulfhydryl reagent, MTSET (Fig. 3), on the transport activity of these residues. MTSET has a quaternary amine group with a fixed positive charge (40Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows that MTSET did not inhibit cysteineless AE1C-. In contrast, mutants S852C, T853C, A855C, L857C, and A858C were inhibited by MTSET to varying degrees, suggesting that this reagent can reach and react with most of the residues in the loop region. However, MTSET did not inhibit mutants at the ends of the transmembrane segments: V849C, V850C, F861C, V862C, and L863C. Notably, all four of these mutants were inhibited by pCMBS or MTSEA. Cl- Reduces the Inhibitory Effect of pCMBS on Mutants V849C and L863C—Kinetic and 35Cl- NMR studies revealed that Cl- competes with AE1 inhibitors pyridoxal phosphate, 4,4′-dinitrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate, and DIDS when binding to the anion transport site (44Salhany J.M. Rauenbuehler P.B. Sloan R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15965-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Frohlich O. J. Membr.

To examine the competition between pCMBS and Cl-, we measured the pCMBS sensitivity of mutant transport activity in the presence and absence of 140 mm NaCl in Ringer's buffer. All of the pCMBS-inhibited mutants in the Phe806-Cys885 region were examined. Some mutants (T853C, L857C, F861C, and V862C) were not significantly influenced by Cl- (Fig. 8A). However, Cl- significantly reduced the inhibitory efficacy of pCMBS for mutants V849C, V850C, A858C, and L863C. The magnitude of the Cl- effect can be quantified from the difference in pCMBS inhibition in the absence and presence of Cl- (Fig. 8B). A clear trend is evident where the ends of the Val849-Leu863 region are most affected by Cl- and the center is least affected. This pattern of Cl- sensitivity strongly suggests that the last two transmembrane segments of AE1 form the anion selectivity filter. Analysis of the inhibition data in the context of AE1 structural models provides additional insight (Fig. 9). Measurements of accessibility of introduced cysteine mutants to biotin maleimide suggested that the last two transmembrane segments are short and connected"

This transmembrane domain lies between TM1 and TM3, which have both been proposed to contain residues that contribute to the substrate binding site. Rat serotonin transporter (SERT) TM2 was investigated by cysteine scanning mutagenesis. Six mutants in which cysteine replaced an endogenous TM2 residue had low transport activity, and two were inactive.

The reactivity of A116C toward MTSEA was substantially increased in the presence of substrates but not inhibitors. This increase required Na+ and Cl–, and was likely to result from conformational changes during the transport process.

It belongs to a large family of neurotransmitter and amino acid transporters called neurotransmitter sodium symporters (NSS) (7Busch W. Saier M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 37: 287-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Other members of the family include transporters for dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GAT). SERT is thought to transport 5-HT, Na+, and Cl– into cells and to transport K+ out in the same reaction cycle (8Rudnick G. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters, Structure, Function, and Regulation. 2nd Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 25-52Google Scholar). The transmembrane topology of SERT predicted from its sequence (9Blakely R. Berson H. Fremeau R. Caron M. Peek M. Prince H. Bradely C. Nature. 1991; 354: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 10Hoffman B.J. Mezey E. Brownstein M.J. Science. 1991; 254: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) consists of 12 transmembrane domains (TM) connected by six external and five internal loops (EL and IL), with the NH2 and COOH termini cytoplasmic. Studies using site-directed chemical labeling of SERT have confirmed this topology (11Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8370-8378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the boundaries between TM and loop domains remain largely unknown. Residues in TM1 and TM3 have been proposed to determine substrate and inhibitor selectivity and to contribute to the substrate binding site and permeation pathway (13Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that SERT exists as a multimer in the membrane (20Chang A.S. Starnes D.M. Chang S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Many transporters in the NSS family contain, in TM2, a leucine repeat motif similar to that found in coiled-coil proteins (25Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 26O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford 3rd, W.F. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Experiments with DAT and GAT-1 have shown that mutations in the leucine repeat of TM2 prevent oligomerization and interfere with the cell surface expression of these transporters (18Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.D. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These results suggest the possibility that residues in TM2 control oligomerization, cell surface expression, or both. However, the role of the leucine repeat in this TM is far from certain. In the present work, we have used cysteine scanning mutagenesis to examine the role of TM2 in transport by replacing each residue, one at a time, with cysteine. Subsequent reaction of the individual cysteine mutants with methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents revealed information about the reactivity and importance of those positions (27Rudnick G. Quick M.W. Transmembrane Transporters. Wiley-Liss, Inc., Hoboken, NJ2002: 125-141Crossref Google Scholar). Our results provide information about the boundaries of the transmembrane region and provide additional evidence that TM2 is involved in cell surface expression. Furthermore, they suggest a functional interaction between the region of EL1 adjacent to TM2 and Cys-357 in IL3. Mutagenesis—Mutant transporters were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutated region was excised by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned back into the original plasmid. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression—Confluent HeLa cells were infected with recombinant vTF-7 vaccinia virus and transfected with plasmid bearing SERT cDNA under control of T7 promoter as described previously (28Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Analyt. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C and then used for the determination of transport and binding activities. Transport Assay—Transfected HeLa cells in 48-well culture plates were washed twice with 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS/CM). Transport of 5-HT was measured by adding 100 μl of PBS/CM containing 20.5 nm [3H] 5-HT (PerkinElmer) to each well and incubating for 10 min at room temperature. The substrates were then removed by washing rapidly three times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed in 250 μlof1%SDS for 20 min, transferred into scintillation vials, and counted in 3 ml of Optifluor scintillant (Packard Instrument Co.). Treatment with MTS Reagents—Mutants were tested for their sensitivity to the MTS reagents (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl)methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) and (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES); MTS reagents were from Toronto Research Chemicals (Ontario, Canada). Cells were preincubated with these reagents for 10 min at room temperature in PBS/CM and then washed three times with 250 μl of PBS/CM. The third wash was left in the wells until the transport assay was performed as described above. For the study of the effect of substrates or cocaine on the action of MTSEA, cells were coincubated with MTSEA and varying concentration of each substrate or cocaine for 10 min. The cells were washed twice with indicated buffer and incubated for 10 min. The cells were washed twice again with PBS/CM to quench residual substrates and unreacted MTSEA, then the transport assay was performed as described above. Membrane Preparation and Binding Assay—HeLa cells grown in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks were transfected with SERT cDNA as described above. The cells were rinsed once with 10 mm HEPES buffer (adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH) and scraped into 15 ml of homogenation buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing protease inhibitor mixture (1:100) (Sigma, P8340) and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1: 500)). The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in 1 ml of homogenation buffer and stored at –80 °C until used. To determine binding activity, the high affinity cocaine analog, 2-β-carbomethoxy-3-β-(4-[125I]iodophenyl)tropane (β-CIT) was used (29Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 421-426PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μl of membrane suspension was incubated with 100 μl of 20,000 cpm carrier-free [125I]β-CIT (RTI-55, PerkinElmer Life Sciences; NEX272, 2200 Ci/mmol, 82 pm final) in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, with NaOH, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation, and the reaction was terminated by washing the membranes three times with 200 μl of binding buffer. Cell Surface Expression—Cell surface expression of SERT mutants was determined using the membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) as described previously (11Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cells expressing transporters in a 12-well plate were treated twice with 500 μlof1.5 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.6, 2 mm CaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl for 20 min on ice. After labeling, the cells were rinsed with 500 μl of 100 mm glycine in PBS/CM for 20 min on ice to quench excess NHS-SS-biotin. The cells were then lysed with 120 μl of SDS-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Sigma protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min on ice with gentle shaking until the cells were completely lysed. The cell lysate was diluted to 1.2 ml with cold lysis buffer (same as SDS-lysis buffer but without SDS and protease inhibitors). The biotinylated proteins were recovered by adding 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) and incubating overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were washed once with 1.2 ml of lysis buffer and high salt lysis buffer (lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and only 0.1% Triton X-100) and twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The biotinylated proteins were eluted with 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% mercaptoethanol, 0.003% bromphenol blue) for 10 min at 85 °C. Portions of each sample (15 μl) were applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting. The transporters were detected using anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.) (1:400) against the FLAG epitope tag at the C terminus of SERT (30Tate C. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) was used to visualize the signal by Super Signal West Femto (Pierce). External Accessibility—The accessibility of introduced cysteine residues in mutant transporters was tested by determining their reactivity to the biotinylating reagent MTSEA-biotin (Toronto Research Chemicals). Cells expressing transporters in a 12-well plate were washed twice with PBS/CM. The cells were then incubated with 500 μl of 1 mm MTSEA-biotin for 10 min at room temperature. After washing the reagent away three times with PBS/CM, the cells were lysed and MTSEA-biotin-labeled proteins were recovered from the cell lysate with streptavidin-agarose as described above. Portions of each sample (15 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using the COOH-terminal FLAG tag on SERT (30Tate C. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SERT was detected by reacting with anti FLAG polyclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., 1:400) followed by anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000). The signals were visualized by chemiluminescence using Super Signal West Femto (Pierce). Transport Activity of Cysteine Mutants—To generate a suitable background construct from rSERT, five endogenous cysteine residues, which were shown to react with MTS reagents (12Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8370-8378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), were replaced with other amino acids. Among the endogenous cysteines in SERT, Cys-109 in EL1 and Cys-357 in IL3 are responsible for inactivation by cysteine-specific MTS reagents. Together with these two cysteines, we replaced reactive cysteines at positions 15, 21, and 622, all of which are located in the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions, with alanine. This X5C construct (C15A/C21A/C109A/C357I/C622A) retained significant transport activity (∼50–60% of C109A) and was used to construct 21 single cysteine mutants in TM2. The transport activity of these mutants varied widely (Fig. 1A). Two of the mutants (P131C and Y121C) were completely inactive, in six other mutants (E136C, M135C, F133C, L119C, L118C, and F117C) 5-HT uptake was measurable but severely impaired (less than 30% compared with X5C), and in three mutants (M124C, A125C, and G128C) transport activity was increased (240%, 150%, and 230% of X5C, respectively). The remaining mutants had levels of transport similar to that of X5C. Binding Activity of Cysteine Mutants—Membrane preparations from HeLa cells expressing cysteine mutants were used to determine binding of the cocaine analog β-CIT. For this analysis, we chose the cysteine mutants with activity levels significantly different from that of X5C. As shown in Table I, transport and binding activity are well correlated in most mutants. Mutant Y121C, however, was inactive for transport but retained some β-CIT binding affinity. 5-HT affinity was measured by its ability to displace β-CIT. From nonlinear regression analysis, the KD for 5-HT was found to be 1.0 ± 0.5 μm and 1.3 ± 0.1 μm for C109A and X5C, respectively. Relative to X5C, apparent KD values for mutants M124C and Y134C were slightly increased (2.5 ± 0.3 μm and 2.2 ± 0.8 μm, respectively). Other mutants showed less significant increases in KD values (1.5 ± 0.15 μm for G128C and 1.85 ± 0.26 μm for Y121C). These results suggest that a change in 5-HT affinity is unlikely to account for the change in transport activity observed for M124C, G128C, and Y121C.Table ICorrespondence between transport and binding activities of TM2 cysteine mutantsMutant% of X5C5-HT influxBinding activityF117C1.4 ± 2.02.2 ± 0.3L118C4.6 ± 1.58.6 ± 1.7L119C31.7 ± 8.921.6 ± 1.5Y121CInactive11.6 ± 2.4M124C241.8 ± 2.6110.1 ± 6.8G128C238.2 ± 3.195.3 ± 2.0P131CInactive0.6 ± 0.8F133C21.8 ± 3.86.4 ± 1.4M135C7.7 ± 0.72.6 ± 1.3E136C6.3 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab Surface Expression of TM2 Mutants—Like transport activity, cell surface expression levels varied widely for the TM2 cysteine mutants, and transport activity generally reflected surface expression. To measure cell surface expression, we labeled cell surface proteins by treating cells expressing each cysteine substitution mutant with NHS-SS-biotin. We then used Western blotting against a FLAG epitope tag to identify SERT in the mixture of solubilized biotinylated proteins recovered using streptavidin beads. The diffuse band at ∼97 kDa was previously identified as the mature glycosylated form of SERT (11Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C109A and X5C were expressed on the surface at similar levels (data not shown), but surface levels of TM2 mutants varied markedly from those of the parental X5C (Fig. 1B). Surface expression of two inactive mutants, Y121C and P131C, was dramatically decreased (17.3% and 5.5%, respectively), and two other mutants, F117C and L118C, were also expressed at low levels (11.4% and 32.9%, respectively), consistent with their poor transport ability. In contrast, expression of G128C and M124C was significantly increased when compared with X5C (129 and 108%, respectively). Other functional mutants were expressed at levels similar to or slightly less than that of X5C. These results described above suggest that the difference in transport activity observed for TM2 mutants may be attributed, at least in part, to the change in their surface expression levels. However, the transport data were from a single assay point at 20 nm 5-HT. To determine the nature of the increased activity for mutants M124C, A125C, and G128C, we measured the 5-HT concentration dependence for each of these mutants and compared them with C109A and X5C. The results presented in Table II indicate that the increased activity in these mutants is primarily in their Vmax, with very little change in Km, consistent with an increase in surface expression.Table IIKinetic characteristics of mutants with increased activityKmVmaxμmpmol min-1 mg-1X5C0.19 ± 0.031.48 ± 0.06M124C0.15 ± 0.023.32 ± 0.11aA125C0.22 ± 0.012.15 ± 0.04bG128C0.24 ± 0.057.86 ± 0.24c Open table in a new tab Mutations of Met-124 and Gly-128 —To further examine the increased activity of M124C and G128C, we substituted those positions with other amino acid residues by mutating position 124 and 128 using degenerate primers that encoded all possible amino acid substitutions. Clonal plasmids obtained from the degenerate product were used to transfect HeLa cells that were subsequently screened for 5-HT transport activity. We obtained several clones with transport activity similar to that of the corresponding cysteine mutant. Table III shows that the replacement of the endogenous methionine at 124 with valine, leucine, or isoleucine enhanced transport activity as well as cysteine. Similarly, the replacement of glycine at position 128 with isoleucine and threonine also increased activity. However, replacing both Met-124 and Gly-128 with isoleucine failed to increase activity in the X5C background and actually decreased activity in the C109A background.Table IIIAmino acid replacements at positions 124 and 128 and their effect on 5-HT influxMutant5-HT influx% of X5C% of C109AM124V-X5C262.4 ± 0.8aValues significantly different (p < 0.05) from control (X5C or C109A).M124I-X5C243.8 ± 4.6aValues significantly different (p < 0.05) from control (X5C or C109A).M124L-X5C256.8 ± 0.7aValues significantly different (p < 0.05) from control (X5C or C109A).M124C-X5C248.6 ± 18.7aValues significantly different (p < 0.05) from control (X5C or C109A).G128I-X5C217.7 ± 5.1aValues significantly different (p < 0.05) from control (X5C or C109A).G128T-X5C226.0 ± 0.7aValues significantly different (p < 0.05) from control (X5C or C109A).M124I/G128I-X5C115.6 ± 11.3G128V/C109A123.0 ± 3.9M124I/G128I/C109A56.1 ± 11.3aValues significantly different (p < 0.05) from control (X5C or C109A).a Values significantly different (p < 0.05) from control (X5C or C109A). Open table in a new tab The X5C mutant, although it is resistant to modification with MTS reagents, has only about half the activity of wild type SERT or the C109A mutant. Most of the activity decrease results from the replacement of Cys-357 (32Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Ghassemi F. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45933-45938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the M124C or G128C mutations might stimulate merely by reversing the effect of the C357I mutation, we also tested the effect of the two mutations in the C109A and C109A/C357I backgrounds. Fig. 2A shows that replacing either Met-124 or Gly-128 with cysteine increased transport activity in both backgrounds, although the stimulation (50–100%) was somewhat less than in X5C (150%, Fig. 1A). As in the X5C background, both M124C and G128C also increased surface expression (Fig. 2B). Accessibility of TM2 Cysteine Residues to MTSEA-biotin—We have previously used labeling with MTSEA-biotin to define the accessibility of internal and external loop residues (11Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8370-8378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Residues Cys-109 and Gln-111 in EL1 and Leu-137 and Ile-157 in IL1 were shown to be accessible to biotin labeling in intact and permeabilized cells, respectively. However, the residues forming the boundaries between TM2 and these loops had not been identified. We used intact cells expressing the TM2 cysteine mutants A116C through L118C, and digitoninpermeabilized cells expressing TM2 cysteine mutants Y134C through L137C to address this question. Cells expressing mutant transporters were labeled with MTSEA-biotin and lysed, and the biotinylated proteins precipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads. After elution from the beads with buffer containing reducing agents, SERT was specifically detected by SDS-PAGE followed by Western-blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. Fig. 3A shows results for those residues near the extracellular end of TM2. E493C contains a highly reactive cysteine in EL5, which reacted strongly with MTSEA-biotin 2P. C. Keller II, M. Stephan, H. Glomska, and G. Rudnick, in press. and was used here as a positive control. X5C contains no reactive cysteines and was used as a negative control. Mutants A116C reacted slightly more than X5C and F117C reacted about the same as X5C, whereas L118C and L119C (not shown) did not react at all, suggesting that the transition between EL1 and TM2 may occur in the vicinity of Ala-116. Results for the intracellular end of TM2 are shown in Fig. 3B. Cells were labeled both with and without permeabilization with digitonin. Fig. 3B also shows that E493C but not X5C reacted in the absence of digitonin. In digitonin-treated cells, L137C reacted much more strongly than in intact cells, demonstrating its intracellular location (12Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8370-8378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even with permeabilization, Y134C and M135C barely reacted and E136C reacted weakly. These results suggest that the transition between TM2 and IL1 may occur in the region between Tyr-134 and Leu-137. Sensitivity of Cysteine Mutants to MTS Derivatives—Cysteine scanning of TM1 and TM3 suggested that some of the residues in these transmembrane domains were accessible to aqueous reagents added from the cell exterior, supporting the existence of an aqueous transmembrane permeation pathway (13Chen J.G.

Cytochromes P450 (P450s) are heme-containing monooxygenases that catalyze diverse reactions in the metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous lipophilic compounds and have been isolated from species as diverse as bacteria and mammals (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). Alkanes are one of the most hydrophobic compounds among substrates of P450s. Alkanes are widespread high energy carbon resources, and many microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and fungi, have developed metabolic systems to utilize those compounds (2Klug M.J. Markovetz A.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1971; 5: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 3Spormann A.M. Widdel F. Biodegradation. 2000; 11: 85-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). P450s are employed for initial terminal hydroxylation of alkanes in some alkane-utilizing prokaryotic (4Cardini G. Jurtshuk P. J. Biol.

Because many P450s are induced by their substrates, the expression of P450s for alkane terminal hydroxylation is also induced by alkanes (4Cardini G. Jurtshuk P. J. Biol.

In contrast to the intensive study of the P450 induction mechanism in mammalian cells that has occurred, little is known about P450 induction in other organisms. The question of how very hydrophobic compounds, such as alkanes, are recognized by cells and cause P450 induction in alkane-utilizing microorganisms is of great interest. P450 induction by n-alkanes has been found in n-alkane-assimilating yeasts such as Candida tropicalis (7Sanglard D. Chen C. Loper J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Yeast. 2000; 16: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but the regulatory mechanism has not been elucidated in any yeasts. The Candida species that have been used so far for studying the alkane metabolism are mostly diploid or partially diploid, and in such species it is difficult to isolate genes by genetic means. We have chosen Y. lipolytica to study the alkane-inducible transcription mechanism because it has a stable haploid life cycle and, therefore, is advantageous for genetic and molecular analysis (15Wickerham L.J. Kurtzman C.P. Herman A.I. Science. 1970; 167: 1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Y. lipolytica utilizes n-alkanes efficiently as its sole carbon source, and this property makes the yeast potentially important in fundamental study and also in biotechnological fields (16Barth G. Gaillardin C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 19: 219-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Y. lipolytica has eight ALK genes, from ALK1 to ALK8, encoding P450ALKs, which presumably catalyze the terminal hydroxylation of alkanes to alkanols in the endoplasmic reticulum (13Iida T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1387-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Iida T. Sumita T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The ALK1 gene disruptant grew very poorly on n-decane, indicating that ALK1 plays the principal role in n-decane assimilation (13Iida T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1387-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Alkanes taken up into the cells and oxidized by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system are further oxidized by the peroxisomal β-oxidation system. Y. lipolytica has the POX1 to POX5 genes that encode acyl-CoA oxidases, catalyzing the first step of the β-oxidation (17Wang H.J. Le Dall M.T. Wach Y. Laroche C. Belin J.M. Gaillardin C. Nicaud J.M.

Both thiolases are thought to be involved in the last step of the β-oxidation. The transcription of P450 and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase genes is highly induced by n-alkanes (13Iida T. Ohta A. Takagi M.

In this study, we isolated mutants that had defects in alkane-dependent transcription induction through a promoter element, ARE1 1The abbreviations used are: ARE1, alkane responsive element 1; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HA, hemagglutinin A; ORF, open reading frame; P450, cytochrome P450; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. 1The abbreviations used are: ARE1, alkane responsive element 1; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HA, hemagglutinin A; ORF, open reading frame; P450, cytochrome P450; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. (alkane responsive element 1). By complementation of a mutant, we identified the YAS1 (yeast alkane signaling) gene, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family protein. The YAS1 gene is essential for the n-alkane-dependent transcription induction of the ALK1 gene. Yas1p binds to promoters with ARE1, which contains an E-box motif, the binding site of the bHLH transcription factor. These features suggest that Yas1p is a transcription factor for alkane signaling.

The plasmid p28-1 is from a genomic library of Y. lipolytica in the autonomously replicating Escherichia coli shuttle vector pSUT5 (19Yamagami S. Iida T. Nagata Y. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A 1.7-kbp HindIII fragment from p28-1 was inserted into the unique HindIII site of pSUT5 to obtain plasmid p28-1HH. The YAS1 deletion cassette was constructed as described below. A 1.4-kbp BglII-EcoRV fragment of p28-1 was inserted into the BamHI and NotI (filled) sites of pBluescript IISK+. The resultant plasmid was digested with SphI and XbaI to remove the YAS1 open reading frame (ORF), blunted, and ligated with the ADE1-carrying BamH I fragment (filled) of pSAT4 to obtain pBS-dyas1. A 1.4-kbp BglII-EcoRV fragment of p28-1 was inserted into the BamHI and EcoRV sites of pBluescript IISK+, and the SpeI-KpnI fragment of the plasmid was inserted between the SpeI and KpnI sites of pSUT5 to generate pSYAS1, a plasmid for producing Yas1p. For epitope tagging of Yas1p, we constructed the plasmid pSYAS1-HA as described below. A BamHI site was introduced before the stop codon of the YAS1 gene by two-step PCR. The first PCR was done with oligonucleotides pairs F3 and CBamR (5′-CCATGAAGCACTCTGACG-3′ and 5′-CTAGGATCCGACCGGAGACTCCTCTTTC-3′) and CBamF and R3.5 (5′-GTCGGATCCTAGAGAGGGCCGAATCTC-3′ and 5′-TAGTGAGTGGCCGATATCG-3′; the BamHI sites are underlined). The obtained two fragments were digested with BamHI, ligated, and used as a template for a second PCR with primers F3 and R3.5. The second PCR product was digested with BglII and EcoRV and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRV sites of pBluescript IISK+ to generate pBS-CBam. Oligonucleotides (5′-GATCCTACCCCTACGACGTCCCCGACTACGCCTATCCTTATGATGTTCCCGACTATGCTTATCCCTACGACGTGCCTGATTATGCTA-3′ and 5′-GATCTAGCATAATCAGGCACGTCGTAGGGATAAGCATAGTCGGGAACATCATAAGGATAGGCGTAGTCGGGGACGTCGTAGGGGTAG-3′) were inserted into the unique BamHI site of pBS-CBam. The SpeI-KpnI fragment of the resultant plasmid was inserted into the SpeI and KpnI sites of pSUT5 to generate pSYAS1-HA, a plasmid producing Yas1p tagged at its carboxyl terminus with three repeats of the HA epitope (Yas1p-HA). To express Yas1p-HA from the LEU2 minimal promoter, we constructed the plasmid pSL-YAS1-HA as described below. A DNA fragment was PCR-amplified using pSYAS1-HA as a template with the primers 5′-GACAGGCCTATGGATTCCCGATCAGCC-3′ and 5′-AACGGTACCTTGCGGAGTGCTACCGCTG-3′. The underlined sections indicate the StuI and KpnI sites introduced upstream of the translation initiation ATG codon and into the 3′-noncoding region, respectively. The amplified fragment was digested with StuI and KpnI and inserted between the StuI and KpnI sites of pSLZ, to generate pSL-YAS1-HA. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—pA3×LZ-UTUH, linearized by digestion with SmaI, and the ADE1-carrying BamHI fragment of pSAT4 were introduced into the CXAU1 strain (13Iida T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1387-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to obtain CXU3×LZ1 (ura3::3×ARE1s-minimal pLEU2-lacZ-ADE1, ade1) and CXAU/A1 (ura3, ade1::ADE1), respectively. Ade+ transformants were analyzed for correct integration by Southern blot analysis. Mutagenized CXU3×LZ1 cells were grown on 1/3YPD-X-gal plates (0.33% yeast extract, 0.67% peptone, 0.67% glucose, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), 0.01% X-gal, and 2% agar) and screened for white or pale blue colonies in the presence of n-decane. The yas1-1 strain was obtained by UV mutagenesis from CXU3×LZ1. The YAS1 deletion cassette was liberated by digesting pBS-dyas1 with SacII and SmaI and introduced into the CXAU1 strain to obtain the yas1Δ strain. Ade+ transformants were analyzed for correct integration by Southern blot analysis. Media and growth conditions were described previously (19Yamagami S. Iida T. Nagata Y. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An appropriate carbon source was added to YNB (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids; Difco) as follows: 2% (w/v) glucose (SD medium); 2% (w/v) glycerol (SG medium); 2% (v/v) n-decane; and 2% (v/v) oleic acid. The growth curve was obtained with an automatically recording incubator TN1506 (Advantec). β-Galactosidase Activity Assay and Northern Blot Analysis—We performed a β-galactosidase activity assay as described (21Sumita T. Iida T. Yamagami S. Horiuchi H. Takagi M. Ohta A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except that the cells were incubated with various carbon sources for 5 h. Northern blot analysis was done as described previously (19Yamagami S. Iida T. Nagata Y. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A BamHI-BamHI fragment from pSUT5lacZ (21Sumita T. Iida T. Yamagami S. Horiuchi H. Takagi M. Ohta A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a PstI-EcoRV fragment from pSAT4-ALK1 (13Iida T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1387-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and a HindIII-XbaI fragment from p28-1HH were used as probes specific for lacZ, ALK1 and YAS1, respectively. For the PAT1 probe, we used a PCR-amplified fragment with the primers 5′-ACAACACCCGCTATTCGTACC-3 and 5′-GTTCTTGATGGACTCGTTGG-3′. Immunoblot Analysis and Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells were incubated with or without n-decane for 1 h after OD600 reached 1.5 in SD medium. Cells were collected, washed, and disrupted in buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with glass beads. Total protein was separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Yas1p-HA was detected by anti-HA antibody (monoclonal antibody, HA.11 16B12 from Berkeley Antibody Co.; 1:5000) and anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:5000). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described (22Barth G. Gaillardin C. Wolf K. Non-conventional Yeasts in Biotechnology: A Handbook. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 313-388Google Scholar). Yas1p-HA was visualized by anti-HA antibody (1:100) followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma; 1:100). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was done as described (23Takahashi K. Saitoh S. Yanagida M. Science's STKE. 2000; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/56/pl1PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with n-decane for 1 h after OD600 reached 1.5 in SD medium. Immunoprecipitation of Yas1p-HA was carried out with an anti-HA antibody at a dilution of 1:100. Specific primer pairs were used to amplify the promoter region of the ALK1 (5′-CTTCTAATGTTGCGGCTC-3′ and 5′-GGTTCTGATGAGTTAACAC-3′), PAT1 (5′-CCTTCGGGCACATCACGTG-3′ and 5′-TTGTATTTGTGTCCCGAGC-3′), YAS1 (5′-TAATCATCACGGGCTGCAG-3′ and 5′-GACCCTAGTCCAAATGGCG-3′), or LEU2 (5′-CACCAACACTATAGTGGCAG-3′ and 5′-CGACAGCAACTACTCCTTTC-3′) genes from the extracted DNA. Identification of ARE1—Because both ALK1 and PAT1 are induced at the transcription level by n-alkanes (13Iida T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1387-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Yamagami S. Iida T. Nagata Y. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we analyzed their promoter regions and found a highly conserved sequence, CTTGTGNxCATGTG (Fig. 1A). We found similar sequences in the promoters of other genes, namely ALK2, POX1, POX3, and POT1, which are involved in the cytochrome P450 and β-oxidation systems (Fig. 1A). The sequences were found in the opposite direction on the promoters of ALK2, whose induction by n-alkanes was shown previously (14Iida T. Sumita T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and POX1 (Fig. 1A). The TGTG repeat (CACA in the opposite direction) is strictly conserved and seems to be important. We named the 24-bp sequence between CTTGTG and CATGTG on the ALK1 promoter the alkane responsive element 1 (designated ARE1) and further analyzed its function. The importance of ARE1 on the ALK1 promoter in alkane response was suggested by deletion analysis of the ALK1 promoter (21Sumita T. Iida T. Yamagami S. Horiuchi H. Takagi M. Ohta A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To analyze the function of ARE1 outside the ALK1 context, we inserted three copies of ARE1 (3×ARE1s) upstream of the minimal Y. lipolytica LEU2 promoter (20Madzak C. Blanchin-Roland S. Cordero Otero R.R. Gaillardin C. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) directing the expression of a reporter lacZ gene. The promoter with 3×ARE1s insertion was activated in response to n-decane (Fig. 1B) or n-hexadecane (data not shown), but not to oleic acid (Fig. 1B). Insertion of mutant ARE1 did not, however, result in n-alkane-dependent activation (Fig. 1B). These findings indicate the specific involvement of ARE1 in alkane-responsive transcription. Because PAT1 is also induced by oleic acid (19Yamagami S. Iida T. Nagata Y. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), another element that is responsive to fatty acids should be present on its promoter. The yas1-1 Mutant Cannot Induce Transcription in Response to Alkanes and Fails to Grow on Alkanes—We constructed a reporter strain, CXU3×LZ, which had lacZ on the chromosome under the control of 3×ARE1s, to isolate mutants with defects in the activation of ARE1 by n-decane on plates containing glucose as a supplementary carbon source (Fig. 2A). Glucose was chosen as a supplementary carbon source because it does not repress the expression of ALK1 (13Iida T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1387-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Of 150,000 mutagenized cells screened, we finally isolated three mutants that had lower levels of β-galactosidase activity and ALK1 mRNA in the presence of n-decane than did the parental strain. One of the mutants failed to induce the expression of lacZ under the promoter with 3×ARE1s and ALK1 in the presence of n-alkanes (Fig. 2B), whereas the induction of PAT1 by oleic acid was not affected (Fig. 2B). The mutant strain did not grow on n-decane or n-hexadecane, but it did grow on glucose and glycerol, as did the wild-type strain (Fig. 2C). This mutant was expected to have a mutation in the signaling pathway for n-alkane-dependent transcription induction, and we named it the yeast alkane signaling mutant strain, designated yas1-1. To our surprise, induction of PAT1 by n-alkanes was not impaired in this mutant (Fig. 2B). The YAS1 Gene Encodes a bHLH Family Protein and Is Essential for Alkane Response—The YAS1 gene was isolated from a Y. lipolytica genomic library (19Yamagami S. Iida T. Nagata Y. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) by functional complementation of the growth defect on n-decane of the yas1-1 mutant. Of ∼22,000 transformants screened, one showed positive growth on n-decane. Analysis and sequencing of the complementing plasmid revealed an ORF of 414 bp (Fig. 3, A and B) that did not contain Y. lipolytica splice site motif sequences (5′ donor site, branch site, and 3′-acceptor site) (16Barth G. Gaillardin C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 19: 219-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bon E. Casaregola S. Blandin G. Llorente B. Neuveglise C. Munsterkotter M. Guldener U. Mewes H.W. Van Helden J. Dujon B. Gaillardin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1121-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the ORF region of the original mutant strain yas1-1 revealed an adenine nucleotide insertion at the position 202 from the first nucleotide of the translation initiation ATG codon and the occurrence of a frameshift mutation. The potential TATA box, TATAA, was found at nucleotides -86 to -82. The deduced product of YAS1, Yas1p, is 137 amino acids in length and has a predicted molecular mass of 15,085 Da. The entire amino acid sequence of Yas1p did not show high homology to any known proteins, but a motif search (25Falquet L. Pagni M. Bucher P. Hulo N. Sigrist C.J. Hofmann K. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) revealed that Yas1p has a Myc-type helix-loop-helix domain preceded by a basic region. A PSI-BLAST search (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59753) Google Scholar) showed that the bHLH domain of Yas1p was most similar to that of Ino4p, which is a transcription factor involved in phospholipid biogenesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27Robinson K.A. Lopes J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). The bHLH family includes transcription factors that are involved in the metabolism of lipophilic compounds such as AhR, ARNT, and SREBP (28Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). We deleted the YAS1 gene from the CXAU1 wild-type strain by replacing the ORF by the ADE1 gene to obtain the yas1Δ strain. The yas1Δ strain was unable to grow on n-decane as the original mutant (Fig. 2B). The yas1Δ strain was also unable to grow in liquid medium containing n-decane as the sole carbon source, but it grew in medium with oleic acid (Fig. 2D). Although alkanes are thought to be metabolized via fatty acids, the YAS1 gene is specifically essential for alkane metabolism, but not for fatty acid utilization. ALK1 induction by n-alkanes was also lost in the yas1Δ strain, as it was in the original mutant (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate that the YAS1 gene is essential for the alkane-responsive induction of ALK1 and for alkane utilization. The Expression Induction of YAS1 by n-Alkanes—To determine whether the expression of YAS1 itself is also regulated by n-alkanes, we examined the level of YAS1 mRNA. The YAS1 mRNA was induced when cells were incubated with n-decane or n-hexadecane (Fig. 4A). We found CACA repeats in the 5′ upstream region of YAS1 (underlined in Fig. 3B). To examine the expression level of Yas1p, we introduced three repeats of a HA epitope into the carboxyl terminus of Yas1p. Expression of Yas1p-HA complemented the growth defect of the yas1-deleted mutant on n-decane (Fig. 4B), indicating that Yas1p-HA is functional. The increase of Yas1p-HA in media containing n-decane was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4C). Yas1p-HA migrated more slowly on SDS-PAGE than expected from the amino acid sequence, probably because of its high proportion of basic amino acids (predicted pI of Yas1p-HA is 9.51) (29Takano E. Maki M. Mori H. Hatanaka M. Marti T. Titani K. Kannagi R. Ooi T. Murachi T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1964-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Yas1p-HA Localizes to the Nucleus—We investigated the localization of Yas1p-HA by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody in cells cultivated in medium with or without n-decane. Accumulation of Yas1p-HA was detected in the nuclei of the cells incubated with n-decane (Fig. 5). Clear localization could not be observed in the cells incubated without n-decane because of the lower level of Yas1p-HA (Fig. 5). The Localization of Yas1p-HA Does Not Depend on n-Decane—To test whether the nuclear localization of Yas1p-HA is regulated by n-alkanes, we expressed Yas1p-HA from the LEU2 minimal promoter (Fig. 6A). To change the promoter, a restriction enzyme site was introduced upstream of the initiation codon, resulting in the addition of three amino acids to the amino terminus of Yas1p-HA. For unknown reasons, this form of Yas1p-HA migrated faster on SDS-PAGE than that expressed from the native promoter. Expression of Yas1p-HA from the LEU2 minimal promoter complemented the growth defect of the yas1-deleted mutant on n-decane (Fig. 6B), indicating that the Yas1p-HA expressed by the promoter is functional. Then, the localization of Yas1p-HA in cells incubated with or without n-decane was investigated (Fig. 6C). Yas1p-HA localized in the nuclei independently of n-decane (Fig. 6C). Yas1p-HA Binding to Promoters Containing ARE1—ARE1 contains an E-box (CANNTG) motif, the consensus sequence with which bHLH proteins interact (30Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization and the bHLH motif of Yas1p prompted us to test whether Yas1p binds to ARE1. We performed ChIP experiments and found that immunoprecipitation of Yas1p-HA yielded many PCR products of ALK1 and PAT1 but not of LEU2, indicating specific associations of Yas1p-HA with ALK1 and PAT1 promoter regions that contain ARE1 (Fig. 7). Approximately the same amounts of PCR product were obtained from whole extracts of cells with or without Yas1p-HA (Fig. 7). Because the expression of YAS1 was induced by n-alkanes and the YAS1 promoter contained CACA repeats, we also tested whether Yas1p-HA binds to its own promoter. Yas1p-HA binding to the YAS1 promoter was also detected (Fig. 7), which suggests an autoregulation of YAS1. The present findings suggest that Yas1p is a novel bHLH transcription factor that binds to ARE1 and is necessary for the transcription induction of the P450ALK1 gene in response to n-alkanes. The bHLH transcription factors are known to work as homo- or heterodimers (30Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). We speculate that Yas1p requires another bHLH protein for its DNA binding, because purified His6-tagged Yas1p expressed in bacteria by itself did not show shift bands toward ARE1 in an electrophoresis mobility shift assay (data not shown). Identification of the putative binding partner of Yas1p and elucidation of the entire alkane response pathway are our planned work. We propose that the expression of YAS1 is regulated by its product, Yas1p. This positive feedback regulation mechanism leads to a rapid increase of YAS1 transcription in the presence of alkanes and subsequently allows a quick activation of the P450 and β-oxidation systems and adaptation to exposure to alkanes. The PAT1 gene was still induced by n-alkanes in yas1 mutants. We considered two possible reasons for this phenomenon. First, some functional homologues of Yas1p might be present and function preferably in the alkane-dependent induction of PAT1. Based on the almost entire loss of the alkane-dependent induction of the ALK1 gene in yas1 mutants, this conclusion is somewhat unlikely; yet, it cannot be completely ruled out. Second, n-alkane-derived fatty acids might induce the expression of PAT1, the expression of which is induced by fatty acids as well (Ref. 19Yamagami S. Iida T. Nagata Y. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and Fig. 2B). The P450ALK1 gene was found to be expressed in slight amounts without n-alkanes or even in the yas1 mutants (Fig. 2B) unless it was repressed by glycerol (13Iida T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1387-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that Yas1p is necessary for the active induction of the ALK1 gene by n-alkanes but that the lack of Yas1p does not cause a complete loss of the expression of ALK1 (see Fig. 2B). Thus, n-alkanes might have been oxidized to fatty acids in the yas1 mutants considered here, and the metabolites may have induced the PAT1 gene expression, although such oxidation would not have sufficed to support the growth of the yas1 mutant cells. Repeats of the sequence CATGTGAA were found in the promoter regions of the alkane-inducible cytochrome P450-encoding genes CYP52A1 and CYP52A2 in the alkane-assimilating yeast Candida tropicalis (9Seghezzi W. Sanglard D. Fiechter A. Gene. 1991; 106: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, a 29-bp region, which contains the CACA motif, was identified as a sequence that responds to n-alkane and oleic acid on the promoter of the peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase gene of C. tropicalis (31Kanai T. Hara A. Kanayama N. Ueda M. Tanaka A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2492-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In another alkane-assimilating yeast, C. maltosa, ATGTG repeats were also found in promoters of the P450ALK genes and the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase gene (11Ohkuma M. Tanimoto T. Yano K. Takagi M. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Ohkuma M. Muraoka S. Tanimoto T. Fujii M. Ohta A. Takagi M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Ohkuma M. Masuda Y. Park S.M. Ohtomo R. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). From this conservation of the TGTG (or CACA) motif, we speculate that the alkane response mediated by Yas1p-like bHLH family proteins is conserved among alkane-assimilating yeasts. Cytochromes P450 are widely distributed in species as diverse as bacteria and mammals and play the central role in the metabolism of hydrophobic compounds (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). The expression of P450s, particularly those involved in the metabolism of exogenous compounds, is induced by their substrates in many cases (33Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18175-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The regulation mechanism of P450 expression has been investigated intensively in mammalian cells (34Waxman D.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) but is poorly understood in lower eukaryotes. Recently, Khan et al. (35Khan R. Tan R. Mariscal A.G. Straney D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) identified a 40-bp pisatin (a fungistatic isoflavonoid)-responsive element upstream of the pisatin demethylase, a cytochrome P450 gene in a plant-pathogenic fungus, and isolated a gene encoding a binuclear zinc (Cys6-Zn2) transcription factor that binds to the 40-bp element. However, the involvement of the DNA-binding protein to the pisatin-dependent P450 induction has not yet been clarified. In mammalian cells, the expression of P450s for xenobiotics metabolism is mediated by members of the nuclear receptor (NR) family and by the dioxin receptor AhR and Arnt, which belong to the bHLH/PAS family (34Waxman D.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptor family proteins have not been identified outside metazoans (36Escriva H. Safi R. Hanni C. Langlois M.C. Saumitou-Laprade P. Stehelin D. Capron A. Pierce R. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and it has been a long unanswered question of how yeast P450ALKs are induced by n-alkanes. We are interested in the evolutional relationship between Yas1p and AhR/Arnt, each of which has a bHLH motif. Upon ligand binding, AhR translocates from cytoplasm to nuclei and forms a heterodimer with its partner Arnt, which localizes in the nuclei (37Mimura J. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Yas1p is a small molecule and does not seem to contain a ligand-binding domain, although the possibility of such a domain cannot be ruled out. The constitutive nuclear localization of Yas1p suggests that Yas1p carries out a different function than AhR does. It will be interesting to consider in future studies whether or not Yas1p functions in a similar manner as Arnt. In addition, it will be important to determine whether a putative partner of Yas1p can bind to alkanes and function as AhR. It is also possible that some other receptors sense alkanes and transduce the signal to Yas1p and its partner. This study provides the first clue for the elucidation of P450 induction mechanisms by exogenous hydrophobic compounds in yeasts and for a comparative understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in species from yeasts to mammals. We thank Dr. H. Horiuch and members of the A.O. lab for discussion and support."
https://openalex.org/W1999388135,"Transfer of the tumor-inducing plasmid in Agrobacterium tumefaciens is controlled by a quorum-sensing system whose main components are the transcriptional regulator TraR and its autoinducer. This system allows bacteria to synchronize infection of the host plant when a “quorum” of cells has been reached. TraM is an A. tumefaciens protein involved in the regulation of this system because it binds to TraR and prevents it from binding DNA. As a first step to understanding the molecular basis for the regulation of TraR by TraM, we have determined the crystal structure of TraM at 1.65 Å resolution. This protein is packed as a dimer, with each monomer consisting mainly of two antiparallel α helices. Monomers are tightly associated, with a large hydrophobic area buried upon dimerization. Secondly, we characterized the TraR-TraM complex in vitro. TraM (11.4 kDa, monomer molecular mass) binds tightly TraR (27 kDa, monomer molecular mass) forming a stable oligomeric complex that likely accounts for two TraR and two TraM dimers. Transfer of the tumor-inducing plasmid in Agrobacterium tumefaciens is controlled by a quorum-sensing system whose main components are the transcriptional regulator TraR and its autoinducer. This system allows bacteria to synchronize infection of the host plant when a “quorum” of cells has been reached. TraM is an A. tumefaciens protein involved in the regulation of this system because it binds to TraR and prevents it from binding DNA. As a first step to understanding the molecular basis for the regulation of TraR by TraM, we have determined the crystal structure of TraM at 1.65 Å resolution. This protein is packed as a dimer, with each monomer consisting mainly of two antiparallel α helices. Monomers are tightly associated, with a large hydrophobic area buried upon dimerization. Secondly, we characterized the TraR-TraM complex in vitro. TraM (11.4 kDa, monomer molecular mass) binds tightly TraR (27 kDa, monomer molecular mass) forming a stable oligomeric complex that likely accounts for two TraR and two TraM dimers. Quorum-sensing is a term that reflects the ability of bacteria to control the expression of specific operons in a cell density-dependent manner and is based on the production, release, and “sensing” of small signal molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the environment as a function of cell density. Both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria use it to regulate several physiological functions, including bioluminescence, virulence factor expression, antibiotic production, and biofilm development (1Miller M.B. Bassler B.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 165-199Google Scholar). As the primary cause of the crown gall disease in plants, the Gram-negative bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens is responsible for substantial loss of perennial crops worldwide (2Zhu J. Oger P.M. Schrammeijer B. Hooykaas P.J. Farrand S.K. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3885-3895Google Scholar). Pathogenesis involves transfer of the tumor-inducing plasmid from the bacterium to the host cell nucleus and the subsequent transcription of opines and phythormones, which cause large tumors to form on stems (3Farrand S.K. Spaink H.P. Kondorosi A. Hooykaas P.J.J. The Rhizobiaceae, Molecular Biology of Model Plant-associated Bacteria. Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 199-233Google Scholar). The conjugal transfer of the tumor-inducing plasmid is strictly controlled by a LuxRI-type quorum-sensing circuit (1Miller M.B. Bassler B.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 165-199Google Scholar). This system is composed of the activator TraR (homologous to LuxR), a cis-acting DNA inverted repeat called trabox, and the autoinducer, N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone. The autoinducer, synthesized by the TraI protein (homologous to LuxI), diffuses freely between the cellular and external environment and, after accumulation, activates the transcriptional regulator TraR. The TraR-autoinducer complex binds to traboxes, upstream of three different tra operons to stimulate transcription of the conjugation genes in a positive feedback loop (4Fuqua C. Winans S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1199-1210Google Scholar, 5Piper K.R. Beck von Bodman S. Hwang I. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1077-1089Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of TraR bound to its autoinducer and to DNA has been reported (6Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. Cortese R. De Franceso R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Google Scholar, 7Zhang R.G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Google Scholar). TraR binds the DNA as a dimer. Each monomer is composed of an N-terminal domain that binds the ligand in an enclosed cavity and a C-terminal domain that binds DNA via a helix-turn-helix motif. Additional regulatory proteins modulate the activity of LuxR-type proteins, such as the protein TrlR, a defective LuxR homologue that forms inactive heterodimers with TraR (8Chai Y. Zhu J. Winans S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 414-421Google Scholar), and other regulators like QscR and TraM that form inhibitory complexes with LuxR-type proteins (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J. Fuqua C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49449-49458Google Scholar, 10Ledgham F. Ventre I. Soscia C. Foglino M. Sturgis J.N. Lazdunski A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 199-210Google Scholar). Among these, the tumor-inducing plasmid-encoded protein TraM from A. tumefaciens modulates TraR-dependent transcriptional activation by direct protein-protein interaction. TraM acts as an anti-activator of TraR by binding to its C-terminal domain and therefore prevents TraR from binding DNA (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J. Fuqua C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49449-49458Google Scholar, 11Hwang I. Smyth A.J. Luo Z.Q. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 282-294Google Scholar, 12Luo Z.Q. Qin Y. Farrand S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7713-7722Google Scholar). This inhibition is required for the normal operation of the quorum-sensing pathway; as a consequence, null mutations in TraM result in constitutive conjugation even at low population density (13Piper K.R. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1080-1088Google Scholar). TraM acts either to prevent TraR from initiating transcription of the tra regulon under non-inducing condition or to shut it down efficiently when the opine signal is no longer available during infection (14Luo Z.Q. Su S. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5665-5672Google Scholar). Thus, TraM plays a key role in determining the threshold level of the bacterial population required for initiating the tumor-inducing plasmid conjugal transfer (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J. Fuqua C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49449-49458Google Scholar). We have determined the crystal structure of the recombinant TraM protein. The structure reveals two molecules per asymmetric unit, arranged as a dimer. To understand the molecular basis of TraR-TraM interaction, we have reconstituted and characterized the complex in vitro. Dimeric TraM binds tightly to dimeric TraR with an equimolar ratio, forming a stable oligomeric complex of ∼150 kDa. A model of the TraR-TraM complex is proposed. Protein Production, Crystallization, and Data Collection—TraR and TraM were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (15Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. De Franceso R.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 146-148Google Scholar). Data from TraM crystals were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation at the beamline ID29, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble. Diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM (17Leslie A.G.W. Brick P. Wonacott A.T. Daresbury Lab. Inf. Quart.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—Selenium atoms were located using the program SnB (19Weeks C.M. Miller R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 492-500Google Scholar) as described previously (16Vannini A. Volpari C. Di Marco S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 146-148Google Scholar). Heavy atom refinement and density modification were carried out at 2.0 Å resolution, using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data from the peak and the remote (as the reference wavelength), in CNX (Accelrys; Pharmacopeia Inc.). 60% of the model was built using QUANTA 2000 (Accelrys; Pharmacopeia Inc.). The model was then fed into Arp/Warp (modality WarpNTrace) (20Perrakis A. Morris R.J.H. Lamzin V.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Google Scholar) to combine model building with iterative structure refinement, using REFMAC (21Murshudov G. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) between 50 and 1.8 Å resolution. This results in an improvement of the electron density maps that allowed us to build over 90% of the model after two runs (200 cycles each) of Arp/Warp, each followed by manual rebuilding. The final model was then refined against the native dataset between 50 and 1.65 Å, using REFMAC (21Murshudov G. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are listed in Table I. Figures were generated with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Electrostatic calculations and associated figures were performed with GRASP (22Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Google Scholar). Size-exclusion Chromatography—To form the TraR-TraM complex, variable amounts of purified TraR (0.5 mm) and TraM (1.6 mm) were mixed and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C in buffer A, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were loaded on a Superdex 200 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Elution was performed at 4 °C, and the flow-rate was held at 0.20 ml/min. The column was calibrated using markers of known molecular weights (catalogue number 1511901; Bio-Rad). Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) 1The abbreviations used are: DLS, dynamic light scattering; ITC, isothermal titration microcalorimetry; Ve, retention volume. and Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry (ITC)—DLS measurements were performed using a DynaPro-801 instrument with temperature control (Protein Solutions). Protein samples were in buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol. For DLS measurements, the concentrations of isolated TraR and TraM were 320 μm and 1.1 mm, respectively. The concentration of the TraR-TraM complex used for DLS measurements was 150 μm. Data analyses were performed on Dynamics analysis software (Protein Solutions). Measurements were done at 20 °C. An Omega titration calorimeter (MicroCal) was used for calorimeter measurements. Titrations were performed at 25 °C and consisted of 17 injections of 15 μl each made every 240 s into a reaction cell volume of 1.296 ml. All proteins were in dialysis equilibrium with buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol. TraR, 170 μm, was titrated into 15 μm TraM. Thermodynamics parameters for the binding reaction were derived using ORIGIN ITC software (MicroCal) by fitting the corrected binding isotherm to a single-site binding model, with stoichiometry (N), enthalpy (ΔH°), and equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) allowed to float during non-linear least-squares fit of the data. Three-dimensional Structure of TraM—Both refined x-ray structures of native TraM at 1.65 Å (Protein Data Bank number 1US6) and the seleno-methionine-labeled TraM at 1.8 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank number 1UPG) contain two TraM molecules, A and B, per asymmetric unit, packed as a dimer (Table I). The two structures are identical and superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.19 Å for Cα atoms. The final model includes 189 of 204 residues for the dimer, and the structure description will focus on the higher resolution structure. In molecule A, electron density is missing for the first 11 residues and the last one, whereas in molecule B only the last three residues are disordered. A portion of the electron density is shown in Fig. 1A. Each monomer presents a T-shaped structure of dimensions ∼45 Å × 27 Å × 12 Å and can be divided into two parts, a “globular head” and an “elongated tail” (Fig. 1, B and D). The two monomers are identical and superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.4 Å for Cα atoms. The core of the molecule is composed of two antiparallel α-helices, α2 (residues 26–53) and α4 (residues 66–94) that pack to each other with a 20° angle, consistent with a “ridge in groove” model for helical packing (23Chotia C. Levitt M. Richardson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 215-250Google Scholar) where the angle between axes of adjacent helices can be either 20° or 50°. Helices α2 and α4 and the short helix α3 (residues 55–60) form the elongated tail. The globular head is formed by the juxtaposition of the helix α1 (residues 15–22) and the N and C termini over the end portion of the long helices α2 and α4. The N and C termini interact with each other via two short antiparallel β-strands, β1 (residues 3–6) and β2 (residues 96–98), to form a small β-sheet. In monomer A, only the strand β2 is visible and stabilized by interactions with a symmetry-related molecule. Each monomer intertwines with the other in a “head-to-tail” fashion, forming a very compact dimer of dimensions ∼47 Å × 35 Å × 20 Å (Fig. 1B). Contacts between monomers involve a large part of each chain. The long helices α4 from each monomer are antiparallel and touch each other to form a 50° angle, once again consistent with a ridge in the groove model of helix packing (23Chotia C. Levitt M. Richardson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 215-250Google Scholar). Helix α1 and the N-terminal portion of helix α2 contact the C-terminal half of helix α4 on the other monomer. As a result, two distinct surfaces exist in the dimer; the front one is irregular, being formed by two adjacent globular heads flanked by two narrow elongated tails, whereas the other on the back side of the molecule is relatively flat (Fig. 1D). TraM can be classified as an α-domain structure (Fig. 1C) (24Lo Conte L. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J.P. Chothia C. Murzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 264-267Google Scholar, 25Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Google Scholar). Searching with MATRAS (26Kawabata T. Nishikawa K. Proteins. 2000; 41: 108-122Google Scholar), a program for protein structure comparison, in the non-redundant protein structure database did not highlight any significant similarity using either the monomer or the entire dimer as a search model. Only local structural similarity was found for the antiparallel helices α2 and α4. The highest structural similarity (Z score = 10, root mean square deviation of 1.1 Å for 57 aligned Cα atoms) is with the small repressor Rop from E. coli (Protein Data Bank number 1NKD; Ref. 27Vlassi M. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Kokkinidis M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1245-1253Google Scholar), which forms a typical four-helix bundle upon dimerization but with a helix packing architecture different from TraM. An extensive contact area is present between monomers, burying 1100 Å2 of surface area, representing 20% of total surface area of the monomer. The TraM interface consists of 25% polar and 75% non-polar residues (Fig. 1D). Although surface interactions between monomers are predominantly hydrophobic, polar interactions include three direct and nine water-mediated hydrogen bonds. It has been observed that obligate homodimers contain relatively few intermolecular hydrogen bonds (28Jones S. Thornton J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 31-65Google Scholar). The association in the TraM homodimer displays characteristics of other non-transient complexes (28Jones S. Thornton J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 31-65Google Scholar), and the two monomers twist together across the interface with a high complementarity. Taken together, these findings suggest that in TraM the monomer-to-monomer association is tight and specific, giving rise to an obligatory dimer. Extensive mutagenesis analyses have been carried out on TraM (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J. Fuqua C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49449-49458Google Scholar, 11Hwang I. Smyth A.J. Luo Z.Q. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 282-294Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis of the interactions of TraR with TraM, we have mapped on the TraM surface only those residues whose alanine mutants have demonstrated a reduction in TraR binding efficiency as well as a loss of activity in vivo: Leu-29, His-40, Arg-41, Leu-54, Tyr-72, Val-86, Gly-94, and Pro-97 (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J. Fuqua C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49449-49458Google Scholar, 11Hwang I. Smyth A.J. Luo Z.Q. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 282-294Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and B). Remarkably, all of these residues face exclusively the front side of the dimer on a discrete grooved surface formed by the elongated tail and an adjacent small region of the globular head in each monomer (Fig. 2, A and B). None of these residues is involved in the dimeric interface, suggesting that TraM could interact with TraR in the dimeric form seen in the crystal structure. Characterization of TraR-TraM Complex—A unique symmetrical peak eluted at a retention volume (Ve) = 12.9 ml when equimolar concentrations of TraR and TraM were applied onto the size-exclusion chromatography column (Fig. 3A, peak 1). This peak was resolved into two bands on SDS-PAGE, migrating at the position expected for each protein with no evidence of proteolytic degradation (Fig. 3A, inset). The elution profile of the complex was compared with those of the isolated proteins (Fig. 3A, peaks 2 and 3). TraR eluted as a single symmetrical peak at 15.3 ml corresponding to 55 kDa, which represents the dimeric form of TraR (7Zhang R.G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Google Scholar, 15Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. De Franceso R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1362-1364Google Scholar, 29Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Google Scholar) in agreement with DLS data (Table II). Isolated TraM, 11.4 kDa molecular mass for the monomer, eluted as a single symmetrical peak at 16.0 ml corresponding to 30 kDa, in agreement with previous biochemical studies (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J. Fuqua C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49449-49458Google Scholar) and in a concentration-independent manner in the range 0.05–2.5 mm. The same estimated value was obtained by DLS experiment (Table II). This value is slightly higher than the theoretical value for dimeric TraM but could be well explained taking into account the elongated dimeric structure of TraM. If the shape of the protein (or oligomer) is nonspherical, its molecular mass from molecular sizing (Fig. 3A, peak 3) and DLS (Table II) can be overestimated due to a higher translation frictional coefficient and hence a lower translational diffusion coefficient than for a spherical particle of the same molecular mass. The retention volume for the peak of the complex corresponds to a 155-kDa protein (Fig. 3A, peak 1), which matches an oligomer formed by two TraR dimers and two TraM dimers. In our hands, the size-exclusion chromatography behavior of the individual purified proteins and the complex was unaffected by lowering or increasing the protein concentrations (0.05–0.5 mm). The complex always resulted in an oligomer of 155 kDa, whereas TraR and TraM always elute as dimers (data not shown). These data were confirmed by DLS (Table II) and disagree with previously published data in which the molecular mass of the complex, formed by co-incubation of E. coli extracts containing TraR and His6TraM, was estimated as 60 kDa by size-exclusion chromatography (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J. Fuqua C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49449-49458Google Scholar). In the same study, E. coli extracts containing radiolabeled TraM had always a smaller degradation product. The authors also stated that isolated proteins eluted as higher molecular mass complexes when higher protein concentrations were used and that co-expression of TraR and His6TraM in E. coli from a single plasmid revealed a protein peak that eluted at high molecular mass (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J. Fuqua C. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab The binding affinity and stoichiometry of TraR-TraM interaction were determined using ITC (Fig. 3C). The fit to the integrated binding isotherm indicates a dissociation affinity constant, KD = 49 nm and essentially a 1:1 stoichiometry (calculated value for TraR-TraM of n = 0.851). The positive value of enthalpy (+6.174 Kcal/mol) indicates an endothermic reaction, where hydrophobic interactions drive the complex formation. The difference between the affinity constant calculated from the rate constants obtained by surface plasmon resonance (1–4 × 10–9m) (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J. Fuqua C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49449-49458Google Scholar) and that determined by ITC (49 × 10–9m) could largely be because of differences in the type of assay. To assess the ability of TraM to abolish the DNA binding activity of TraR upon complex formation, two excesses of trabox, a specific DNA 18-base pairs operator that binds TraR (29Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Google Scholar), were incubated with the TraR-TraM complex and then loaded onto a size-exclusion chromatography column. The elution profile of the sample was compared with that of TraR, trabox, and the TraR-trabox complex (Fig. 3B). Although isolated TraR is able to bind trabox, producing a shift of the protein peak from Ve = 15.3 ml to 14.7 ml, the TraR-TraM complex is not able to bind trabox, resulting in two separate peaks, one corresponding to the complex (Ve = 12.9 ml) and the other to the isolated trabox (Ve = 16.6 ml) (Fig. 3B). Model of TraR-TraM Complex—The crystal structure of TraM shows that all TraM mutants with an impaired ability in binding TraR (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J.

Mutagenesis analysis of TraR has shown that residues crucial for TraM binding are all located in the DNA binding domain (6Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. Cortese R. De Franceso R.

Thus, for clarity, we have considered just the DNA binding domain of TraR in the description of a possible mode of interaction. A dimer-to-dimer interaction between TraR and TraM does not seem plausible. Based on crystal structures of TraR (6Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. Cortese R. De Franceso R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Google Scholar, 7Zhang R.G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Google Scholar) and TraM (this study), not all TraM residues crucial for TraR binding would be in contact simultaneously with one dimeric DNA binding domain of TraR. Furthermore, the presence of two globular heads in the TraM dimer (Fig. 2B) provides a steric hindrance that would not allow TraR to bind into the two grooves where most of TraM mutants are located. Lastly, this hypothesis does not agree with size-exclusion chromatography and DLS results (Fig. 3A and Table II). Instead, a complex formed by two TraR dimers and two TraM dimers would account for our biochemical results and agree with previous studies that suggest that the association of TraM and TraR is more complex than a simple one-to-one binding (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J. Fuqua C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49449-49458Google Scholar). Assuming no relevant conformational changes upon complex formation, a feasible architecture would be that shown in Fig. 4, A and B, in which each TraR dimer located externally contacts two TraM dimers simultaneously, acting as a clamp. A model in which each dimer of one protein simultaneously contacts two dimers of the other protein is the only one possible for a stable two-to-two dimer complex. This model implies that the 2-fold axis of each TraR dimer is orthogonal to the 2-fold axis of each TraM dimer (Fig. 4A). Using the crystal structures of the isolated proteins, we constructed manually, imposing geometrical constraints shown in Fig. 4A, a three-dimensional arrangement of a putative complex that displays a good shape complementary (Fig. 4B). Here, each narrow groove of one TraM dimer seems to accommodate well the recognition helix of one TraR DNA binding domain, mimicking a half-site of the DNA operator. In this model, most of the TraR and TraM mutants lie on the interfaces between the two proteins. In addition, the surface charge distribution does not reveal any relevant repulsion between single components (data not shown). The N terminus of TraM lies very close to the TraR binding region, and our model suggests that an extended N-terminal TraM variant, like a His-tagged protein (9Swiderska A. Berndtson A.K. Cha M.R. Li L. Beaudoin G.M. Zhu J. Fuqua C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49449-49458Google Scholar), might interfere with the formation of a stable oligomeric complex with TraR (Fig. 4B). The present work clarifies some issues raised from previous biochemical studies of the TraR-TraM complex and suggests, based on the three-dimensional structure of the isolated proteins, a possible mode of interaction that leads to the complete inactivation of the key quorum-sensing regulator TraR in the pathogenic bacterium A. tumefaciens.

We now demonstrate that LpxA in cell extracts of Mesorhizobium loti and Leptospira interrogans, which synthesize lipid A molecules containing 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucopyranose (GlcN3N) units in place of glucosamine, do not acylate UDP-GlcNAc.

E. coli LpxA acylates UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcNAc3N at comparable rates in vitro. However, UDP-GlcNAc3N is not synthesized in vivo, because E. coli lacks gnnA and gnnB.

https://openalex.org/W2159233354,"Using yeast two-hybrid, ligand blotting, and solid phase binding assays, we have shown that microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1 (MAGP-1) interacts with the 8-cysteine motif of fibrillin-2 encoded by exon 24. Binding to this sequence was demonstrated for full-length MAGP-1 as well as for the MAGP-1 matrix-binding domain encoded by exons 7 and 8. The matrix-binding domain, but not the full-length protein, also bound to regions of fibrillin-2 defined by exons 16 and 17, exon 20, and exons 23 and 24. Interestingly, no binding was detected to sequences near the N or C terminus where MAGP-1 and MAGP-2, respectively, were shown to interact with fibrillin-1. The localization of MAGP-1 binding to the 8-Cys domain encoded by exon 24 suggests that the bead structure of microfibrils consists of exon 24 and portions of the central region of fibrillin-2. Exon 24 in fibrillin lies in the region of the molecule where mutations produce the most severe phenotypes associated with Marfan syndrome (fibrillin-1) and congenital contractural arachnodactyly (fibrillin-2). It is possible that these mutations alter the ability of fibrillin to bind MAGP-1, which may contribute to the severity of the disease.

It is possible that these mutations alter the ability of fibrillin to bind MAGP-1, which may contribute to the severity of the disease. Microfibrils are found in the extracellular matrices of most tissues where they serve several functional roles, including the binding and sequestration of growth factors, supplying informational signals through receptor signaling, and providing the basic structural elements for elastic fiber assembly. Many different proteins have been localized to microfibrils, although it is not clear whether all are structural proteins or proteins that simply associate with other components of microfibrils (1Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 747-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Sherratt M.J. Wess T.J. Baldock C. Ashworth J. Purslow P.P. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Micron. 2001; 32: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The fibrillins provide the basic functional framework of microfibrils. This multigene family consists of three related proteins (fibrillin-1, -2, and -3) that have a similar domain structure but differ in expression pattern and biological function (3Handford P.A. Downing A.K. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The fibrillins are secreted from the cell as dimers that then pack together in ways that are not completely understood to form the microfibril. Extracted microfibrils are typically visualized as a linear string of beads with multiple arms extending into the interbead region. The beads show a ∼50-nm spacing, and several models of fibrillin assembly have been proposed to account for packing a 150-nm fibrillin monomer into a structure with 50-nm periodicity (4Reinhardt D.P.

A second protein associated with microfibrils is a small molecular mass glycoprotein called microfibril-associated glyco-protein. MAGP-1 1The abbreviations used are: MAGP, microfibril-associated glycoprotein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FBN, fibrillin; MBD, matrix-binding domain; SD, selective deficient (medium); Y2H, yeast two-hybrid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. contains 183 amino acids that form two distinctive domains; the N-terminal half of the molecule is highly acidic, enriched in proline, and contains a clustering of glutamine residues, whereas the C-terminal portion contains all 13 cysteine residues and contains the matrix-binding domain that mediates the association of MAGP-1 with microfibrillar components (6Segade F.

The protein undergoes post-translational transglutamination, sulfation of specific tyrosine residues, and O-linked glycosylation (7Trask B.C. Broekelmann T.J. Mecham R.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In mouse development, MAGP-1 mRNA is widely expressed, mainly in mesenchymal and connective tissue cells where it is easily detected as early as day 8.5 of development (8Chen Y. Faraco J. Yin W. Germiller J. Francke U. Bonadio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27381-27389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAGP-1 is associated with all microfibrils with only two known exceptions: those directly adjacent to the plasma membrane of aortic endothelial cells and those at the junction of the zonule and the lens capsule of the eye (9Henderson M. Polewski R. Fanning J.C. Gibson M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kumaratilake J.S. Gibson M.A. Fanning J.C. Cleary E.G. Eur. J.

MAGP-2 is a second member of the MAGP family that has close sequence similarity to MAGP-1 in a central region of 60 amino acids, where the spacing of 7 cysteine residues is identical in both proteins. The MAGP-2 molecule is otherwise rich in serine and threonine residues and lacks the proline-, glutamine-, and tyrosine-rich sequences characteristic of the N-terminal domain of MAGP-1 (12Gibson M.A. Hughes J.L.

Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). MAGP-2 exhibits a more restricted pattern of tissue localization and developmental expression than MAGP-1 (15Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochm. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting that MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 are structurally divergent proteins sharing one functional motif (encoded by two conserved exons) rather than being functionally closely related molecules. Both MAGPs have been shown to directly bind to purified fibrillin, and for MAGP-2, a prominent binding site was localized to a C-terminal region of fibrillin-1 containing seven tandem calcium-binding EGF-like repeats (16Penner A.S. Rock M.J. Kielty C.M. Shipley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35044-35049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Preliminary mapping studies with MAGP-1 have localized putative binding sites near the N terminus (17Jensen S.A. Reinhardt D.P. Gibson M.A. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39661-39666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and in the middle portion (18Trask B.C. Trask T.M. Broekelmann T. Mecham R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1499-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) of fibrillin-2, although these sites have not been mapped in great detail. In this study, we used a biochemical and molecular approach to precisely identify a prominent MAGP-1-binding site in fibrillin-2. The binding site maps to an 8-cysteine motif, encoded by exon 24, in a region of the fibrillin-2 molecule where mutations associated with the inherited disease congenital contractural arachnodactyly cluster. This is also the region where mutations in fibrillin-1 produce the most severe form of Marfan syndrome. Because MAGP-1 has been shown to reside on the bead structure of microfibrils (9Henderson M. Polewski R. Fanning J.C. Gibson M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), defining its binding site in fibrillin is important in discerning which part of the fibrillin molecule contributes to the bead. This information is critical for understanding the molecular packing that facilitates fibrillin assembly into a microfibril. Materials—A partial FBN2 cDNA was provided by Dr. Francesco Ramirez (Hospital for Special Surgery at Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). A bovine MAGP-1 cDNA was provided by Dr. Mark Gibson (University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia), and the human MAGP-1 cDNA is described in Segade et al. (6Segade F. Trask B.C. Broekelmann T.

Cell culture media and supplies were from commercial suppliers as indicated or from the Washington University Tissue Culture Support Center. The Matchmaker GAL4 Two-hybrid System 3 was purchased from Clontech. Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes were purchased from Promega or Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma, Fisher, and Bio-Rad unless noted. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—FBN2 constructs were subcloned into the pGADT7 yeast expression vector (Clontech) encoding the GAL4 activation domain. The DNA fragment coding for the MAGP-1-MBD (exons 7–8) was amplified from the MAGP-1Ex(7–8)-GFP expression vector (6Segade F. Trask B.C. Broekelmann T. Pierce R.A. Mecham R.P. J. Biol.

To assess transformation efficiency, transformation mixtures were plated on the nutritionally selective medium SD-Leu/-Trp; and to select for GAL4-dependent growth, transformed cells were plated on the nutritionally selective medium SD-Ade/-His/-Trp/-Leu. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 4–6 days. The colonies were scanned and counted by IPLAB software, version 3.53 (Scanalytics Inc.). The colony number is expressed as the quotient between the number of colonies in the SD-Ade/-His/-Trp/-Leu medium divided by the number of colonies in SD-Leu/-Trp medium, and then expressed as a percentage of the values obtained from the positive control (co-transformation of plasmids pGADT7-T and pGBKT7-p53 encoding the interacting partners SV40 Large T antigen and human p53 proteins, respectively). Transformations with each of the expression vectors alone or in combination with the empty pGBKT7 vector (for FBN2 constructs) or empty pGADT7 vector (for the MAGP-1-MBD construct) were used as negative controls. α-Galactosidase activity (MEL1) was assayed as described by Ryan et al. (19Ryan M.P. Jones R. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1774-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In Vitro Translation Procedures—[35S]Cys-labeled FBN2 protein fragments were prepared by in vitro transcription/translation of the plasmids used in the Y2H study using TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system as described by the manufacturer (Promega). The ability of the radiolabeled peptides to bind bacterially expressed GST-MAGP-1Ex(7–8) was assessed by ligand blot followed by autoradiography. Antibodies—Antibodies to Aik (the region of FBN2 encoded by exons 10–17), MAGP-1, and NLR3 have been described (7Trask B.C. Broekelmann T.J. Mecham R.P.

Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the generation of FBN2 deletion mutants (Fig. 1), 2Sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used for the generation of the expression vectors and detailed cloning procedures are available from the authors upon request. the appropriate oligonucleotide primers were used in high fidelity PCR using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to amplify DNA fragments derived from human FBN2 (GenBank™/EBI accession number U03272) cDNA sequences. Amplified constructs were cloned into the appropriate expression vector as indicated in the main text. The integrity of the constructs was verified by sequencing. Plasmids for transfections were purified from bacterial cultures using the Qiagen Endo-Free DNA purification kit. Production of FBN2 Fragments in Bacterial Cells—For the expression of FBN2 truncation products in bacteria, the amplified coding fragments were cloned into the appropriate pQE series of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible vectors (Qiagen) to obtain a fusion product with a N-terminal 6-histidine tag. For large scale production of recombinant proteins, log phase cells cultured in 100 ml of Luria broth at 37 °C were induced to produce protein with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Five hours post-induction, the cultures were pelleted, lysed with lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, and 8 m urea, pH 8.0, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Recombinant proteins were purified from the crude lysate by binding to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose matrix (Qiagen). After two washes with urea buffer adjusted to pH 6.3, the retained FBN2 proteins were eluted from the resin with buffer containing 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, and 8 m urea, pH 5.9. Production of MAGP-1 and FBN2 Fragments in Mammalian Cells— The generation of CHOK1 stable transfectants expressing NLR3e/6, Aik, and full-length bovine MAGP-1 and the protein purification procedures are described elsewhere (18Trask B.C.

J. 1999; 340: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Production of FBN2 Fragments in Sf9 Insect Cells—To express the fragment FBN2Ex(18–25), the amplified coding sequence was cloned into the pFastBac shuttle vector (Invitrogen). After plasmid/bacmid recombination, positive clones were identified by blue/white selection. Bacmid DNA was prepared by alkaline lysis and transfected into Sf9 cells in serum-free medium using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) for 4 h at 27 °C. After cell lysis, which occurred about 5 days after transfection, the conditioned medium was removed, centrifuged to eliminate cell debris, and used to infect fresh Sf9 cultures. Positive cultures for protein expression were determined by Western blot of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose-purified conditioned medium. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in polyacrylamide gels. For reducing gels, 50 mm dithiothreitol was added to the sample buffer. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) for 1 h at 70 V in 10 mm 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid, 10% methanol (v/v). For Western blot analysis, the membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C, then incubated with specific primary antibodies (1:1000) for 1 h, and washed twice with blocking agent. The membranes were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed twice, and developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ligand Blot Analysis—FBN2 constructs were run on 10–15% SDS-PAGE gels under either reducing or nonreducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose as described above. The blots were blocked after transfer with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (blocking agent) for 1 h at room temperature. Full-length bovine MAGP-1 partially purified by QA-cellulose chromatography was added to the blocking agent, and the blots were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C under gentle shaking. The blots were washed and then incubated with MAGP-GST antibody diluted 1:1000 in blocking agent for 1 h at 37 °C. Bound protein was detected with horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:1000 in blocking agent for 1 h at 37 °C. The blots were then washed three more times with milk/phosphate-buffered saline, and the immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the ECL system. Autoradiography was used to detect bound, radiolabeled proteins generated by in vitro translation. Solid Phase Binding Assay—Fibrillin-2 constructs expressed in CHO cells were isolated from culture medium using ammonium sulfate precipitation or nickel affinity chromatography. The proteins were suspended in Tris-buffered saline and added to wells of 96-well plates. After 16 h at 4 °C, the wells were rinsed three times with wash buffer consisting of Tris-buffered saline containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, 2 mm CaCl2 (binding buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with wash buffer, the fibrillin-coated wells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with serial dilutions of MAGP-1-containing medium harvested from MAGP-1-transfected CHO cells. At the end of the incubation period, the wells were washed three times with wash buffer and incubated for 1 h with an antibody to MAGP-1 diluted 1:500 in binding buffer. After three washes, the wells were incubated 1 h with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:500 dilution) and washed, and bound antibody was detected with the ABTS Microwell Peroxidase Substrate System as described by the manufacturer (KPL Laboratories). Bioinformatics—Primary sequence input, alignment, and conceptual translation were performed with the LASERGENE package of programs (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). The Matrix-binding Domain in MAGP-1 Binds to the N-terminal Region of FBN2—To map the MAGP-1-binding site in fibrillin-2, we utilized yeast two-hybrid assays to identify associations between fragments of fibrillin-2 and the MAGP-1-MBD. The MBD of MAGP-1, a cysteine-rich region encoded by exons 7 and 8, was shown in earlier studies to be the minimal sequence in MAGP-1 capable of directing its deposition onto microfibrils in the extracellular matrix (6Segade F. Trask B.C. Broekelmann T. Pierce R.A. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11050-11057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The functional constructs consisted of the MAGP-1-MBD cloned into the pGBKT7 yeast expression vector coding for the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to generate a fusion protein GAL4 BD-MBD that served as bait. Constructs derived from the N-terminal region of FBN2 were cloned into the pGADT7 vector that codes for the GAL4 activation domain to generate FBN2-GAL4 AD chimeric proteins that were used as targets. The ability of each construct to make appropriate protein was verified by in vitro translation, as described below. Yeast competent cells were co-transformed with the MAGP-1 plasmid bait and a FBN2 target vector, and selection was performed by culture of the transformed cells in triple selective medium (see “Experimental Procedures”) that restricts growth to those cells in which interaction between bait and target takes place. To minimize the number of false positives, we measured the GAL4-dependent α-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table I, no functional interaction was detected between the MAGP-1-MBD and FBN2Ex(1–9) or FBN2Ex(58–63). GAL4-dependent cell growth (Fig. 2) and α-galactosidase activity (Table I) were obtained, however, from the interaction between the MBD and FBN2Ex(10–17) and FBN2Ex(18–25), with the 18–25 construct showing the strongest interaction. Using fragments of the 18–25 region, we found that constructs FBN2Ex(18–20), containing three EGF domains; FBN2Ex(20–23), containing a hybrid domain flanked by two EGF domains; FBN2Ex(23–25), comprised of the 8-cysteine domain flanked by two EGF domains; and FBN2Ex(23–24), the 8-cysteine domain preceded by a single EGF domain, showed similar levels of cell growth and α-galactosidase activity (Table I and Fig. 2). Interestingly, no interaction was detected when the MBD was screened against exon 24 alone (FBN2Ex24) or exon 23 alone (FBN2Ex23), suggesting that the MAGP-1-MBD does not interact with exon 24 in the Y2H assay without a flanking EGF domain.Table ISummary of yeast two-hybrid and cell-free translation ligand blotting results assessing the interactions between fragments of fibrillin-2 and the MAGP-1 matrix-binding domain Colony number (cell growth) is expressed as the percentage relative to the number of colonies in the SD-Ade/-His/-Trp/-Leu medium divided by the number of colonies in SD-Leu/-Trp medium and then normalized to the values obtained from the pGADT7-large T and pG-BKT7-p53 positive control (see Fig. 2). α-Galactosidase activity is scored as present (+) or absent (-) in nutritionally selected transformed cells. Similarly, ligand blotting results from in vitro transcribed and translated constructs of FBN2 probed with GST-MBD fusion proteins are scored as positive (+) or negative (-).FBN-2 constructsCell growthα-Galactosidase activityLigand blotEx 1-9--Ex 10-173+++Ex 16-172+++Ex 18-254+++Ex 18-204+++Ex 203+++Ex 20-234+++Ex23-254+++Ex 23-244+++Ex 23--Ex 24--Ex 37-38--Ex 58-63-- Open table in a new tab Yeast Two-hybrid Results Confirmed by Ligand Blot Analysis—To corroborate the Y2H results, we utilized a ligand blot assay in which protein from the FBN2 constructs generated by in vitro translation was probed with bacterially expressed GST-MAGP-1Ex(7–8). We took advantage of the presence of the T7 promoter in the pGADT7 vector used to clone the FBN2 fragments to generate transcripts that were in vitro translated using reticulocyte lysate containing [35S]cysteine. Integrity of the proteins and confirmation of their predicted molecular masses were done by electrophoresis in denaturing gels followed by autoradiography (not shown). For the ligand blot, the GST-MAGP-1Ex(7–8) protein was separated using 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with individual in vitro translated FBN2 fragments. After washing, bound fragment was detected by autoradiography. A summary of the results, shown in the right column of Table I, confirmed the interactions detected by Y2H. MAGP-1 Binds to the N-terminal Region of FBN2—The Y2H experiments provided information suggesting that the binding domain for MAGP-1 is located in exons 18–25 of fibrillin-2 but were not definitive in identifying the precise binding sequence in this region. To better characterize the MAGP-fibrillin-2 interaction, we used full-length MAGP-1 protein in ligand blot assays with a recombinant fragment of FBN2 encoded by exons 1–25, FBN2Ex(1–25), described in previous studies as NLR3e/6 (21Trask T.M. Crippes Trask B. Ritty T.M. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24400-24406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Both proteins were expressed in CHO cells and purified from the conditioned media as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3A shows purified FBN2Ex(1–25) protein (predicted molecular mass, ∼118,000) separated using 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and stained with Coomassie Blue to verify purity. Tropoelastin was included as a positive control for the ligand blot assay because its interaction with MAGP-1 has been previously described (22Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Mecham L. Mercer R. Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28443-28449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ovalbumin served as a control for nonspecific interactions. For ligand blot analysis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with purified full-length bovine MAGP-1. Anti-MAGP-1 antibodies were then used to detect MAGP-1 bound to the immobilized proteins. Fig. 3B shows that MAGP-1 bound to both tropoelastin and FBN2Ex(1–25), but no interaction was detected with the negative control protein, ovalbumin. Mapping of the Interaction of FBN2 and MAGP-1 to Exons 10–25 of FBN2—To better localize MAGP-1 binding within the FBN2Ex(1–25) construct, purified FBN2Ex(1–25) protein was digested with mouse macrophage elastase (MMP-12), a metalloprotease that cleaves FBN2 at a single site within the glycine-rich domain (exon 10) (23Ashworth J.L. Murphy G. Rock M.J. Sherratt M.J. Shapiro S.D. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that MMP-12 cleavage generated two fragments of ∼85 and ∼45 kDa. A small amount of undigested FBN2Ex(1–25) was also visible. Western blotting with an antibody to exon 24 confirmed that the larger fragment (∼85 kDa) contained the C-terminal portion of FBN2Ex(1–25) (not shown) and, hence, contains exons 10–25. Evidence that the higher molecular mass band is not a dimer of the 45-kDa protein was demonstrated using an antibody generated against a peptide sequence in exon 1 of fibrillin-2. Only the parent protein and lower band were positive with this antibody (not shown). After transfer to nitrocellulose, incubation with full-length MAGP-1 and detection with the MAGP-1 antibody showed an interaction between MAGP-1 and the intact, undigested FBN2Ex(1–25) protein as well as the 85-kDa cleavage product (Fig. 4B). There was no interaction of MAGP-1 with the ∼45-kDa fragment, which contains the N-terminal sequences encoded by exons 1–9. It is important to note that MAGP-1 bound efficiently to reduced FBN2Ex(1–25) (Fig. 4B), indicating that binding is independent of the oxidation state of the disulfide bonds. To confirm that the lack of interaction between MAGP-1 and the 45-kDa digestion product was not due to the proteolysis of specific determinants as a result of mouse macrophage elastase treatment, we generated a plasmid construct (NLR3c) containing exons 1–9 of FBN2. The protein product, FBN2Ex(1–9), was expressed in bacteria, affinity-purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography, and used in a ligand blot assay. Consistent with results from the MMP-12 digest and Y2H assays, we were not able to detect an interaction between FBN2Ex(1–9) and MAGP-1 (Fig. 4C), confirming the absence of a MAGP-1-binding site in the N-terminal region of fibrillin-2 protein. Mapping of the MAGP-1-binding Domain to FBN2 Exon 24 —Y2H and ligand blot analysis both confirm that MAGP-1 binds fibrillin-2 at a site between exons 10 and 25. To define the sequence required for the MAGP-1-FBN2 interaction, we developed a series of expression constructs that span the FBN2Ex(10–25) region. The first construct, expressed in CHO cells from the Aik plasmid (21Trask T.M. Crippes Trask B. Ritty T.M. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24400-24406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), produced the FBN2Ex(10–16) fragment (Fig. 1). In ligand blot assays, MAGP-1 was unable to bind the FBN2Ex(10–16) protein (Fig. 5), thus indicating that the MAGP-1-binding site is located between exons 18 and 25. This region of the molecule, FBN2Ex(18–25), was cloned into a baculovirus expression vector and expressed in Sf9 insect cells (Fig. 6A). Western blot analysis indicated that the recombinant protein was intact after purification. Ligand blotting confirmed that the MAGP-1-binding site was active in this smaller fragment of FBN2 (Fig. 6), consistent with the Y2H results."

TGF-β signaling is mediated through its interaction with three types of cell surface receptors, RI, RII, and RIII. The soluble ectodomains of RII and RIII bind to TGF-β, making them attractive candidates to sequester TGF-β and inhibit its activity. To optimize the activity of the ectodomains, we studied the effect of artificially dimerizing them upon their kinetics of binding to TGF-β using an optical biosensor and studied their antagonistic potencies using an in vitro signaling assay. We fused the RII ectodomain and the membrane-proximal ligand-binding domain of the RIII ectodomain to de novo designed heterodimerizing coil strands and demonstrated that the coil strands within the fusion proteins were capable of promoting the dimerization of the coil-tagged ectodomains. Our results indicate that coiled coil-induced dimerization of the ectodomains stabilized their interaction with TGF-β as compared with the monomeric ectodomains. Also, in contrast to the monomeric ectodomains, which did not block signaling, the coiled coil-induced dimers were characterized by antagonistic potencies in the low nanomolar range.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, both RI and RII can form homooligomers (2Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 bind simultaneously to two RII ectodomains (RIIEDs) (3Hart P.J. Deep S. Taylor A.B. Shu Z. Hinck C.S. Hinck A.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar). This binding event is thought to reorient the RIIs at the cell surface, allowing for the formation of a signaling-competent RI-RII complex (4Zhu H.J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RIII was first thought to be an “accessory” receptor whose role is to present TGF-β2to RI and RII (5Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest, however, that the role of RIII is more complex. Firstly, it was demonstrated that RIII is required for TGF-β1-promoted mesenchymal transformation during chick embryonic heart development (6Brown C.B. Boyer A.S. Runyan R.B. Barnett J.V. Science. 1999; 283: 2080-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that the RIII cytoplasmic domain is important for signaling (7Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Pepin M.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24627-24637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and that the role of RIII in signaling may be modulated by its glycosylation state (8Eickelberg O. Centrella M. Reiss M. Kashgarian M. Wells R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Two independent TGF-β-binding domains have been identified within the RIII ectodomain (9Fukushima D. Butzow R. Hildebrand A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22710-22715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pepin M.C. Beauchemin M. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14588-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), further emphasizing the complexity of this receptor. TGF-β is involved in the regulation of many physiological processes including cell growth and differentiation. TGF-β overexpression plays a key role in several human pathologies including fibrotic diseases (12Border W.A. Noble N.A. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1993; 22: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and metastasis (13Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Recently, two reports provided encouraging results showing that a TGF-β antagonist, corresponding to the RIIED artificially dimerized through the Fc portion of an antibody (RIIED-Fc), reduces metastasis in vivo without any adverse side effects (14Muraoka R.S. Dumont N. Ritter C.A. Dugger T.C. Brantley D.M. Chen J. Easterly E. Roebuck L.R. Ryan S. Gotwals P.J. Koteliansky V. Arteaga C.L. J. Clin.

Other soluble TGF-β-binding proteins, including the ectodomain of RIII, have also been evaluated for their antagonistic potency (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Montiel J.L. Mendoza V. Mendoza-Hernandez G.

We reported that their in vitro antagonistic potency inversely correlates with their rate of dissociation from TGF-β (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The best antagonist found so far is RIIED-Fc, which blocks TGF-β1 and -β3 signaling in vitro with an IC50 in the picomolar range (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Komesli S. Vivien D. Dutartre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These findings raise the interesting question of whether the antagonistic potency of the extracellular domains of other TGF-β receptors can be increased by artificially dimerizing them, as in the case of RIIED-Fc. In this report, we use a de novo designed heterodimerizing coiled-coil system (the E5/K5 coiled coil) that we have characterized (21De Crescenzo G. Litowski J. Hodges R.S. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in order to rapidly produce and evaluate the effect of receptor ectodomain homo- and heterodimerization on their ability to bind to TGF-β1 and to antagonize signaling. This coiled-coil system is an ideal dimerization domain since the coils are small (35 amino acids) and specifically heterodimerize, with the resulting non-covalent coiled-coil complex being stable. We have previously produced and characterized a chimera composed of RIIED fused to the E5 coil (RIIED-E5), which retained the same kinetics of binding to TGF-β1 as untagged RIIED (22De Crescenzo G. Pham P.L. Durocher Y. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the expression of two new fusion proteins containing the K5 coil, i.e. RIIED-K5 and the fusion of the K5 coil to the membrane-proximal ligand-binding domain of RIIIED (MP-RIIIED-K5). We investigated the binding of these fusion proteins to TGF-β1 using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor. We showed that the coil domains were able to promote the dimerization of RIIED-E5 with MP-RIIIED-K5 or with RIIED-K5. We also analyzed the effect of coiled coil-induced RIIED/RIIED and MP-RIIIED/RIIED dimerization both on binding to TGF-β1 and on the potency of the ectodomains to block TGF-β1 signaling in vitro. Our results indicate that the dimers have better antagonistic potencies than the corresponding monomers.

The yields of RIIED-K5 and MP-RIIIED-K5 from 500 ml of conditioned media were ∼570 and 600 μg, respectively. The purity of the fusion proteins was estimated by silver staining using the Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad) after resolving the proteins on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. The purified proteins were also detected by Western blot (anti-myc 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) following protein separation on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Higher order aggregates were observed by Western blot under nonreducing conditions for RIIED-K5. Monomeric RIIED-K5 was prepared as follows. RIIED-K5 (320 μg) was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to a final volume of 10 ml and spun in a Centriprep 30 (Amicon). The filtrate was then concentrated using a Centriprep 10, leading to a 500-μl fraction with a RIIED-K5 concentration of 555 nm. The efficacy of the separation of oligomers from monomer was estimated by Western blotting (non-reducing conditions), and the protein concentration was determined as described above. SPR Experiments—SPR experiments were conducted at 25 °C using HBS (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20) as running buffer and for diluting all the species injected in Biacore experiments. 3500 RU of anti-hRII antibody were coupled to a CM5 sensor chip surface using the standard amine coupling procedure and an anti-hRII antibody (20 μg/ml) in 10 mm acetic acid (pH 4.0). TGF-β1 surfaces and control surfaces were prepared as described previously (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol.

Injections of RIIED-K5 or Equimolar Mixtures of RIIED-K5 and RIIED-E5 over TGF-β1—Experiments were carried out with a flow rate of 5 μl/min in the case of RIIED-K5 injections and 50 μl/min in the case of RIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 mixture injections. Concentrations of RIIED-K5 alone or mixed with equimolar concentrations of RIIED-E5 (0–50 nm) were randomly injected in duplicate over TGF-β1 and control surface. Regeneration of the sensor chip between injections was accomplished by two pulses of HCl (20 mm, 120 s) followed by an EXTRACLEAN procedure. Injections of MP-RIIIED-K5 or Equimolar Mixtures of MP-RIIIED-K5 and RIIED-E5 over TGF-β1—Experiments were carried out at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. Concentrations of MP-RIIIED-K5 alone (0–500 nm) or mixed with equimolar concentrations of RI-IED-E5 (0–150 nm) were randomly injected in duplicate over TGF-β1 and control surfaces.

In vitro TGF-β1 (10 pm) signaling assays were performed and analyzed as described previously (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol.

We have previously produced and purified RIIED-E5 for immobilization on a biosensor surface (22De Crescenzo G. Pham P.L. Durocher Y. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study, we designed and expressed two additional fusion proteins that were tagged with the K5 coil (RIIED-K5 and MP-RIIIED-K5). Both fusion proteins were N-terminally myc-tagged for detection and C-terminally His- and K5 coil-tagged for purification and dimerization, respectively. Silver staining and Western blots of SDS-PAGE showed that the purified RIIED-K5 fusion protein contained disulfide-bridged aggregates since bands with higher than expected molecular weights were detected under non-reducing but not under reducing conditions (Fig. 1, A and B). Silver staining under reducing conditions indicated that the RIIED-K5 fusion protein was relatively pure (data not shown). The aggregate forms of RIIED-K5 were then removed from the preparation using a Centriprep 30 device (Fig. 1, C and D). In the case of MP-RIIIED-K5, SDS-PAGE silver staining and Western blotting showed that the MP-RIIIED-K5 fusion protein was relatively pure and contained no aggregates (Fig. 1, E and F). Evidence for Coiled Coil-induced Ectodomain Dimer Formation—We next tested whether the coil-tagged ectodomains were able to dimerize through E5/K5 interactions using an SPR-based biosensor (the Biacore). An antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of RII was coupled to the sensor chip surface. To demonstrate that RIIED-E5 and MP-RIIIED-K5 can heterodimerize, the following series of experiments were performed. First, to evaluate whether there was any nonspecific binding of MP-RIIIED-K5 to the anti-hRII antibody, MP-RIIIED-K5 (200 nm) was injected over the antibody surface. MP-RIIIED-K5 did not interact significantly with the antibody (Fig. 2A). RIIED-E5 was then injected over the antibody and followed by a MP-RIIIED-K5 injection. When 200 RU of RIIED-E5 were captured on the biosensor surface through the antibody/RIIED interaction, the injection of MP-RIIIED-K5 resulted in a strong increase in the SPR signal (140 RU), indicating that MP-RIIIED-K5 bound to the captured RIIED-E5. Since untagged RIIED was not able to bind significantly to MP-RIIIED-K5 (Fig. 2B), it can be concluded that the E5 and K5 domains of the RIIED-E5 and MP-RIIIED-K5 fusion proteins were responsible for the dimerization of the two fusion proteins. We then tested whether the coiled-coil interaction is able to mediate RIIED-E5/RIIED-K5 ectodomain dimerization. Increasing concentrations of RIIED-E5 (31–500 nm) were successively injected over the anti-hRII antibody surface. After this series of injections, the antibody surface was almost saturated (Fig. 2C). However, a strong increase in the SPR signal was observed when the RIIED-K5 injection (50 nm) followed the RIIED-E5 injections, indicating that the E5 and K5 coils induced RIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 dimerization. TGF-β1 Binding to RIIED-K5 and RIIED-E5 Versus RIIED-K5/RIIED-E5—The TGF-β1 binding characteristics of the monomeric RIIED-K5 preparation were tested by SPR and compared with those that we had previously determined for monomeric RIIED-E5 (22De Crescenzo G. Pham P.L. Durocher Y. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and monomeric untagged RIIED (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J.

TGF-β1 was coupled to the biosensor surface, and several concentrations of RIIED-K5 (0–50 nm) were injected. The control-corrected set of sensorgrams was globally fit using a kinetic model depicting the presence of two independent RIIED binding sites on the TGF-β1 molecule (Fig. 3A). This model was selected since we previously showed that it best depicts TGF-β1 interactions with RIIED and RIIED-E5 (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol.

Solutions containing equimolar concentrations of RIIED-K5 and RIIED-E5 (0–50 nm) were injected over the same TGF-β1 surface. The resulting sensorgrams are strikingly different from those obtained with monomeric RIIED-K5 (Fig. 3) and monomeric RIIED-E5 (22De Crescenzo G. Pham P.L. Durocher Y. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This difference confirms that dimerization of the coiled-coil domains of the RIIED fusion proteins did occur and demonstrates that the dimer has a significantly slower apparent off-rate than the monomeric RIIED. Global analysis of the RIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 sensorgrams using a simple model gave a poor fit. More complex biological models were then used to globally fit the data. Since TGF-β1 is a covalent dimer and since we artificially dimerized RIIED through coiled-coil interactions, two mechanisms of binding can be envisioned. 1) The RIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 dimer binds to two TGF-β1 molecules on the biosensor surface at the same time (avidity model), or 2) one RIIED domain within the coiled coil-induced dimer binds to one monomer of TGF-β1, followed by the interaction of the other RIIED domain with the other monomer within the same TGF-β1 dimer. This corresponds to an overall 1:1 (dimer-to-dimer) stoichiometry model with a rearrangement step after the initial binding (rearrangement model). The rearrangement model depicted the interaction best as indicated by the standard deviation of the residuals (Table II). This is in agreement with our previous results showing that this model was the best to represent the binding of TGF-β1 to the RIIED-Fc artificial dimer (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J.

The amount of active TGF-β1 was determined to be 62.5 ± 2 RU when fitting the monomeric RIIED-K5 interaction with a 2:1 stoichiometry model. In the case of the RIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 data, we found that this amount was 61.7 ± 1 RU for the rearrangement model, 40 ± 3 RU for the simple model, and 145 ± 4 RU for the avidity model. This observation further supports the validity of the 2:1 stoichiometry model for the interaction of TGF-β1 with monomeric RIIED-K5 and the validity of the rearrangement model for the interaction of TGF-β1 with the RIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 dimer. TGF-β1 Binding to MP-RIIIED-K5 Versus MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5—We next examined the binding of TGF-β1 to MP-RIIIED-K5 and evaluated the effect of dimerizing MP-RIIIED-K5 with RIIED-E5. To do so, we coupled 75 RU of TGF-β1 to the biosensor surface and injected either MP-RIIIED-K5 or MP-RIIIED-K5 preincubated with equimolar amounts of RIIED-E5 (Fig. 3). Global analysis of both sets of sensorgrams indicated that these interactions deviated from a simple binding mechanism. In the case of the MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 heterodimer, a complex mode of binding is not surprising since one TGF-β1 dimer is thought to possess two RIIED binding sites and one MP-RIIIED binding site (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is difficult to choose a complex binding mechanism that would yield meaningful constants when fitting the non-dimerized MP-RIIIED-K5/TGF-β1 data since this interaction has not been studied in any detail previously. By comparing the sensorgrams corresponding to the injections of MP-RIIIED-K5 with those corresponding to the injection of MP-RIIIED-K5 preincubated with RIIED-E5 (Fig. 3, C and D), it can be seen that 6 RU versus 60 RU were reached at the end of the injection of 125 nm MP-RIIIED-K5 versus 150 nm MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5, respectively. This marked difference in RU cannot result solely from the increase in the molecular weight of the dimer versus the monomer (an ∼2-fold difference). Instead, it must result from an increased affinity of the coiled coil-induced dimer for TGF-β1. Analysis of the Antagonistic Potency of Non-dimerized and Coiled Coil-dimerized Ectodomains—The ability of non-dimerized RIIED-E5, RIIED-K5, and MP-RIIIED-K5 versus dimerized RIIED-E5/RIIED-K5 and MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 to block TGF-β1 signaling was tested using mink lung epithelial cells stably transfected with a TGF-β-responsive luciferase reporter gene. Neither RIIED-K5 nor RIIED-E5 at concentrations up to 30 nm was able to inhibit TGF-β1-induced receptor signaling (Fig. 4A). In contrast, RIIED that was dimerized by preincubating equimolar concentrations of the two coil-tagged versions of RIIED was able to block signaling by 50% at 7.5 nm. Somewhat surprisingly, MP-RIIIED-K5 alone enhanced TGF-β1 signaling (a 2-fold increase at 270 nm, Fig. 4B). This enhancement effect was also present when MP-RIIIED-K5 was preincubated with equimolar concentrations of the E5 coil, which will mask the K5 coil hydrophobic and charged residues, indicating that the effect was not due to the unpaired coil strand. In contrast, when MP-RIIIED-K5 was preincubated with equimolar amounts of RIIED-E5, the resulting dimer was able to block signaling with an IC50 of 40 nm. When MP-RIIIED-K5, at a constant concentration of 150 nm, was preincubated with varying concentrations of RIIED-E5, we observed an IC50 of 7 nm RIIED-E5 (Fig. 4B). This shift in the IC50 suggests that the antagonistic potency of the MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 dimer may be limited by the affinity of the coiled-coil interaction (see “Discussion”). To study the effect of RIIED homodimer and RIIED/MP-RIIIED heterodimer formation, both on the kinetics of binding to TGF-β1 and on the potency to antagonize TGF-β1 signaling, we adopted the strategy of tagging both ectodomains at their C terminus with the E5 or the K5 coil to promote their dimerization through coiled-coil interactions (Fig. 1). The ability of the coils to mediate the dimerization of the extracellular domains was confirmed using SPR (Fig. 2). We then compared the kinetics of binding to TGF-β1 of coil-tagged non-dimerized RIIED-K5 and RIIED-E5 (22De Crescenzo G. Pham P.L. Durocher Y. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with those of the RIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 homodimer by SPR. This technique was chosen since it had been used successfully to determine the kinetics and stoichiometries of binding of RIIED and RIIED-Fc to TGF-β (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the case of coil-tagged non-dimerized RIIED-K5 (Fig. 3A), global analysis of the data indicated that the model best representing the data was a 2:1 stoichiometry model and that as for the E5 tag (22De Crescenzo G. Pham P.L. Durocher Y. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the presence of the K5 coil within the fusion protein did not significantly affect RIIED binding to TGF-β1 (Table I). In contrast, in the case of the RIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 homodimer, the model that best described the interaction of the coiled coil-induced dimer with TGF-β1 was a 1:1 dimer:dimer stoichiometry model including a rearrangement step (Fig. 3B and Table II). We previously determined that the apparent Kd for the interaction of RIIED-E5 with synthetic K5 coil was 0.5 nm (22De Crescenzo G. Pham P.L. Durocher Y. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Assuming that the coiled-coil interaction, when occurring between RIIED-K5 and RIIED-E5, has the same affinity, it is possible to calculate the percent of total RIIED that would be dimerized when equimolar amounts of RIIED-E5 and RIIED-K5 are preincubated. Based on this calculation, we estimate that the percent of dimer varied from 80 to 91% for the range of concentrations used in Fig. 3B, supporting the idea that RIIED is binding predominantly as a dimer to TGF-β1. This conclusion is strongly reinforced by our previous results with the covalent dimer RIIED-Fc; i.e. the same kinetic model was found to best depict the interaction of that dimer with TGF-β1 (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Even though the homodimers of RIIED, obtained either by fusion to the Fc portion of an antibody or through coiled-coil interactions, shared the same mechanism of binding, their kinetic and thermodynamic constants displayed some differences (Table II). Indeed, the TGF-β1 interaction with the noncovalent coiled-coil dimer was characterized by a significantly faster initial on-rate and a slightly faster off-rate as compared with the RIIED-Fc dimer. Small differences were also observed in the rearrangement step. From these kinetic constants, it is possible to calculate an apparent dissociation rate and affinity (kdapp and Kdapp), which globally describe the binding. This calculation yields similar apparent dissociation rates for both dimers (1.8 and 3.2 × 10–3 s–1 for the coiled coil-versus Fc-induced dimers, respectively) but apparent Kds that differ by 40-fold (1.5 and 60 nm for the coiled coil-versus Fc-induced dimers, respectively; see Table II). This difference results mainly from the difference in the initial on-rates. A comparison of non-dimerized MP-RIIIED-K5 and MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 heterodimer binding to TGF-β1 indicated that heterodimerization resulted in an increase in the apparent affinity (Fig. 3, C and D). We previously showed that RIIED and RIIIED bind to TGF-β1 at independent sites (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, within the MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 heterodimer, both RII and RIII binding sites should be able to interact with one TGF-β1 dimer, thereby increasing the affinity by a multiple contact mechanism similar to that of homodimerized RIIED. We complemented our kinetic study by testing the antagonistic potency of the non-dimerized and coiled coil-dimerized ectodomains using a luciferase reporter assay in mink lung epithelial cells (Fig. 4). The absence of any antagonistic effect with non-dimerized coil-tagged RIIED is in good agreement with previous results from our laboratory and from others, which showed that non-tagged RIIED has no effect upon signaling at concentrations as high as 500 nm (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Komesli S. Vivien D. Dutartre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that a form of RIIED artificially dimerized through the Fc portion of an antibody blocks signaling with an IC50 of ∼0.1 nm (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We show here that RIIED that was homodimerized through coiled-coil interactions was able to block TGF-β1 signaling with an IC50 of 7.5 nm (Fig. 4A). This difference can be explained by the affinity of the coiled-coil interaction. That is, the potency of the coiled-coil RIIED dimer is likely limited by the affinity of the coiled-coil interaction since the Kd for the dimerization of the coil-tagged RIIEDs (0.5 nm, see above) is higher than the IC50 of the covalent Fc dimer (0.1 nm). In other words, at concentrations below 0.5 nm, a large portion of the coil-tagged RIIED population will be acting as a monomer rather than a dimer. Non-dimerized MP-RIIIED-K5, at concentrations higher than 150 nm, strikingly enhanced TGF-β1 signaling (Fig. 4B). Similar observations were made by Fukushima et al. (9Fukushima D. Butzow R. Hildebrand A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22710-22715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a MP-RIIIED construct similar to ours in a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. This result contrasts with the antagonistic behavior of full-length RIIIED (16De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and underlines the complexity of RIII function. This agonist effect may result from the MP-RIIIED domain being able to interact with TGF-β in such a way that TGF-β is presented more effectively to RII on the cell surface. This effect also emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanisms of interaction of the ectodomains when using them as a basis to design TGF-β antagonists. In contrast to the MP-RIIIED-K5 enhancement of TGF-β1 signaling, we observed an antagonistic effect for the coiled coil-induced MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 heterodimer (Fig. 4B). As with the RIIED coiled coil-induced homodimer, the antagonistic potency of the MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 mixture appeared to be limited by the affinity of the coiled-coil interaction. That is, when the concentration of MP-RIIIED-K5 was held at a constant relatively high level with the concentration of RIIED-E5 varying, the IC50 was lower as compared with when the concentration of both MP-RIIIED-K5 and RIIED-E5 varied across the curve (Fig. 4B). This lower IC50 likely results from a larger portion of the receptor ectodomain population being in a dimeric form. The antagonistic potency of the coiled-coil MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 heterodimer can be explained by the ability of the RIIED moiety to mask the RII binding site within TGF-β1, thereby preventing binding to the cell surface RII. We propose that the MP-RIIIED-K5 moiety, within the heterodimer, acts to stabilize the TGF-β1/MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 ternary complex. This idea is supported by our SPR experiments, which showed that the MP-RIIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 interaction with TGF-β1 was characterized by a complex wash-off phase, which included a slow dissociating component, as compared with nondimerized RIIED (compare panels A and D of Fig. 3). Similarly, in the case of the coiled coil-induced RIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 homodimer, both ectodomains within the dimer simultaneously bind to the two monomers within the TGF-β1 dimer, resulting in a stable TGF-β1/RIIED-K5/RIIED-E5 ternary complex (Fig. 3B). In conclusion, we have shown that coiled coil-induced dimerization can be used as a strategy to enhance the potency of TGF-β receptor ectodomains to sequester TGF-β and inhibit signaling. The main advantage of this coiled coil-induced dimerization strategy is that well defined monomeric, homodimeric, and heterodimeric forms of the receptor ectodomains can be rapidly produced and evaluated. The disadvantage of this approach resides in the fact that the potency of the coiled coil-induced dimer is limited by the affinity of the coiled-coil interaction. However, this can be overcome by modifying the coiled-coil sequence such that a disulfide bond is formed when the coil strands interact."
https://openalex.org/W2140819186,"We have shown previously that the 134-residue endonuclease domain of the bacterial cytotoxin colicin E9 (E9 DNase) forms channels in planar lipid bilayers (Mosbahi, K., Lemaître, C., Keeble, A. H., Mobasheri, H., Morel, B., James, R., Moore, G. R., Lea, E. J., and Kleanthous, C. (2002) Nat. Struct. Biol. 9, 476-484). It was proposed that the E9 DNase mediates its own translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane and that the formation of ion channels is essential to this process. Here we describe changes to the structure and stability of the E9 DNase that accompany interaction of the protein with phospholipid vesicles. Formation of the protein-lipid complex at pH 7.5 resulted in a red-shift of the intrinsic protein fluorescence emission maximum (λmax) from 333 to 346 nm. At pH 4.0, where the E9 DNase lacks tertiary structure but retains secondary structure, DOPG induced a blue-shift in λmax, from 354 to 342 nm. Changes in λmax were specific for anionic phospholipid vesicles at both pHs, suggesting electrostatics play a role in this association. The effects of phospholipid were negated by Im9 binding, the high affinity, acidic, exosite inhibitor protein, but not by zinc, which binds at the active site. Fluorescence-quenching experiments further demonstrated that similar protein-phospholipid complexes are formed regardless of whether the E9 DNase is initially in its native conformation. Consistent with these observations, chemical and thermal denaturation data as well as proteolytic susceptibility experiments showed that association with negatively charged phospholipids destabilize the E9 DNase. We suggest that formation of a destabilizing protein-lipid complex pre-empts channel formation by the E9 DNase and constitutes the initial step in its translocation across the Escherichia coli inner membrane. We have shown previously that the 134-residue endonuclease domain of the bacterial cytotoxin colicin E9 (E9 DNase) forms channels in planar lipid bilayers (Mosbahi, K., Lemaître, C., Keeble, A. H., Mobasheri, H., Morel, B., James, R., Moore, G. R., Lea, E. J., and Kleanthous, C. (2002) Nat. Struct. Biol. 9, 476-484). It was proposed that the E9 DNase mediates its own translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane and that the formation of ion channels is essential to this process. Here we describe changes to the structure and stability of the E9 DNase that accompany interaction of the protein with phospholipid vesicles. Formation of the protein-lipid complex at pH 7.5 resulted in a red-shift of the intrinsic protein fluorescence emission maximum (λmax) from 333 to 346 nm. At pH 4.0, where the E9 DNase lacks tertiary structure but retains secondary structure, DOPG induced a blue-shift in λmax, from 354 to 342 nm. Changes in λmax were specific for anionic phospholipid vesicles at both pHs, suggesting electrostatics play a role in this association. The effects of phospholipid were negated by Im9 binding, the high affinity, acidic, exosite inhibitor protein, but not by zinc, which binds at the active site. Fluorescence-quenching experiments further demonstrated that similar protein-phospholipid complexes are formed regardless of whether the E9 DNase is initially in its native conformation. Consistent with these observations, chemical and thermal denaturation data as well as proteolytic susceptibility experiments showed that association with negatively charged phospholipids destabilize the E9 DNase. We suggest that formation of a destabilizing protein-lipid complex pre-empts channel formation by the E9 DNase and constitutes the initial step in its translocation across the Escherichia coli inner membrane. Unraveling the interactions and mechanisms that enable proteins to cross biological membranes is of considerable interest, as the ability to target specific exogenous enzymes to the cytosol is likely to facilitate the design and discovery of novel chemotherapeutic agents. Many protein toxins have evolved to deliver a cytotoxic domain or subunit to the cytoplasm of susceptible cells, and so they provide an invaluable tool for studying protein translocation from the extracellular environment to their cellular targets, often located in the cytoplasm (1Falnes P.Ø. Sandvig K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The transition from the water-soluble to membrane-bound state has perhaps been most intensely studied in the pore-forming colicins (2Stroud R.M. Reiling K. Wiener M. Freymann D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Zakharov S.D. Cramer W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This family of bacterial toxins, like all colicins, share a common three-domain structure, with receptor-binding and translocation domains that facilitate binding to the cell surface and mediate delivery of the channel-forming cytotoxic domain to the inner membrane. Cell death occurs as a consequence of ion channel formation across the cytoplasmic membrane, inducing depolarization of the membrane. Association of the cytotoxic domain with the membrane is thought to lead to destabilization and unfolding of the protein, yielding a “molten globule-like” state of loosely interacting helices (4van der Goot F.G.

Biophys. 1999; 32: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Electrostatic interactions are known to play an important role in mediating this interaction, particularly in the initial formation of the colicin-lipid complex (5Muga A.

The major phospholipid constituents of the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane are phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 1The abbreviations used are: PG, phosphatidylglycerol; DOPG, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; λmax, intrinsic protein fluorescence emission maximum; E9 DNase, the isolated 15-kDa endonuclease domain of colicin E9; Im9, the colicin E9 immunity protein; KPi, potassium phosphate; RL-P, lipid:protein molar ratio; Tm, melting temperature; ANS, 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; ECP, eosinophil cationic protein. 1The abbreviations used are: PG, phosphatidylglycerol; DOPG, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; λmax, intrinsic protein fluorescence emission maximum; E9 DNase, the isolated 15-kDa endonuclease domain of colicin E9; Im9, the colicin E9 immunity protein; KPi, potassium phosphate; RL-P, lipid:protein molar ratio; Tm, melting temperature; ANS, 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; ECP, eosinophil cationic protein. and cardiolipin. The most abundant of these, phosphatidylethanolamine, is zwitterionic and usually accounts for around 70-80% of total cytoplasmic membrane phospholipid. Both PG and cardiolipin are anionic and account for the remaining 20-30% of phospholipid in an approximate 2:1 ratio (9Kadner R.J. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, DC1996: 58-87Google Scholar). Both PG and cardiolipin are widely distributed throughout Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and are, to a large degree, responsible for the overall anionic character of bacterial membranes.Our current work focuses on the mechanism by which the cytotoxic DNase domain of the microbial toxin colicin E9 is able to translocate into the cytoplasm of susceptible cells to reach its cellular target, the bacterial chromosome. The E9 DNase domain shares no extensive sequence or structural similarities with the pore-forming colicins but does share with this group of toxins the ability to form ion channels in planar lipid bilayers (10Mosbahi K. Lemaître C. Keeble A.H. Mobasheri H. Morel B. James R. Moore G.R. Lea E.J. Kleanthous C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the pore-forming colicins, which kill cells through depolarization of the inner membrane, the channels formed by the E9 DNase domain do not in themselves cause cell death, because a mutant protein lacking DNase activity is still able to induce channel formation in planar lipid bilayers but is not cytotoxic (10Mosbahi K. Lemaître C. Keeble A.H. Mobasheri H. Morel B. James R. Moore G.R. Lea E.J. Kleanthous C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Instead, it was proposed that the observed channels are related to the ability of the E9 DNase domain to translocate across the inner membrane and must somehow reseal on entry of the domain into the cytoplasm. This possibility was inferred from the observation that the introduction of a specific disulphide bond in the E9 DNase domain had little effect upon the endonuclease activity of the DNase domain but abolished both channel activity and colicin cytotoxicity.The 134-residue colicin E9 DNase domain is monomeric in solution (11Pommer A.J. Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and, like all the enzymatic colicins, forms a high affinity complex with its cognate immunity protein, Im9 (12Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13743-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Walker D. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4161-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The immunity protein serves to protect the producing cell from the lethal effects of the toxin but must be jettisoned before translocation into the target cell. Unusually for an enzyme-inhibitor complex, the immunity protein does not bind directly to the active site of the E9 DNase, but rather to an adjacent exosite (14Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.

Sci. 2001; 10: 624-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The catalytic center of the E9 DNase domain contains the HNH motif, which is the site for both DNA and metal binding (16Walker D.C. Georgiou T. Pommer A.J. Walker D. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The HNH motif is also found in a variety of endonucleases, including the caspase-activated DNase that is responsible for degradation of the chromosome during eukaryotic apoptosis (16Walker D.C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9288-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The E9 DNase binds Zn2+ ions with nm affinity, and this interaction considerably stabilizes the protein (19Pommer A.J.

However, for the DNase domain to be enzymatically active in vivo, Mg2+ ions are required, although these do not bind directly to the protein in the absence of DNA (16Walker D.C. Georgiou T.

Intoxication of E. coli cells by colicin E9 induces the SOS response, the characteristic response to DNA damage, prior to cell death (21Walker D. Rolfe M. Thompson A. Moore G.R. James R. Hinton J.C.D. Kleanthous C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Here we describe the interaction of the E9 DNase with phospholipid vesicles. Working predominantly with anionic phospholipids, we studied the effects of the protein-lipid interaction on the structure and stability of the protein using fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with chemical and thermal denaturation experiments. We also compared the accessibility of the protein tryptophans to quenching agents with and without lipids. Our data show strong similarities to those resulting from the global changes that occur to the structure of poreforming colicins during the initial stages of their association with negatively charged phospholipid membranes, and these are discussed in the paper.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Purification—The E9 DNase domain and Im9 with a C-terminal 6-histidine tag were co-expressed from BL21 (DE3) cells containing the plasmid pRJ353 (22Garinot-Schneider C. Pommer A.J. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The E9 DNase domain was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, as described previously, with minor modifications (22Garinot-Schneider C. Pommer A.J. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To ensure that the protein was metal-free, after nickel affinity chromatography, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the protein was dialysed against 50 mm KPi, pH 7.2 and desalted by gel filtration chromatography in the same buffer (Superdex-75). The protein was then dialysed against 3 × 5 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 500 mm NaCl, 1 × 5 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 200 mm NaCl, 5 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 3 × 5 liters of dH2O. The protein was verified as being free of contamination by both metal and EDTA by its ability to bind a stoichiometric amount of zinc as determined by ANS binding, as described by Pommer et al. (19Pommer A.J. Kühlmann U.C. Cooper A. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27153-27160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The protein was then aliquoted, lyophilized, and stored at -20 °C. The concentration of the E9 DNase was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 17,550 m-1 cm-1 (19Pommer A.J. Kühlmann U.C. Cooper A. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27153-27160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For experiments in which the zinc-bound protein was used, ZnCl2 was added to give a Zn2+:E9 DNase ratio of 1.2:1.Lipid Vesicle Preparation—1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (DOPG) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) were supplied by Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. Lipid vesicles were prepared by using a film hydration method followed by extrusion through polycarbonate filters (23Olson F. Hunt C.A. Szoka F.C. Vail W.J. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 557: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 mg of phospholipid in a 1:1 chloroform:methanol solution was dried by evaporation under nitrogen, and final traces of solvent were removed under vacuum. The lipid film was then hydrated with 1 ml of buffer and stirred at room temperature to form multilamellar vesicles. To form homogenous unilamellar lipid vesicles, the phospholipid solution was extruded 12 times through 0.2 μm polycarbonate filters. The presence of unilamellar vesicles was confirmed by electron microscopy after negative staining with ammonium molybdate (23Olson F. Hunt C.A. Szoka F.C. Vail W.J. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 557: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Spex-FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon) equipped with a Neslab RTE-111 circulating water bath. Spectra were recorded in 10 mm KPi, pH 7.5 at a protein concentration of 0.2 or 1 μm using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm, with excitation and emission slits set to 3 nm. Thermal denaturation profiles were obtained by monitoring the λmax in the temperature range 15-80 °C. Tm values were obtained by fitting raw data to Eq. 1. y=y0+a/(1+exp(−(x−x0)/b))(Eq. 1) where y is the λmax, y0 is the starting value, x is the temperature, and x0 is the Tm. Fluorescence emission was used to monitor the E9 DNase denaturation with increasing concentrations of urea. Solutions of the E9 DNase (1 μm) with urea at concentrations from 0-5 m were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Phospholipids in the form of lipid vesicles (DOPG and DOPC) were included at a concentration of 30 μm where shown. Quenching experiments using acrylamide were carried out by using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm at a protein concentration of 1 μm in either 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 4.0, at a phospholipid: protein ratio of 150:1, where stated. Acrylamide, from a 5.63 m stock dissolved in water (Fluka Biochemika), was titrated into the protein or protein-lipid solution up to a final concentration of 0.2 m. All of the spectra were buffer-subtracted and corrected for dilution. The Stern-Volmer equation Fo/F=1+Ksv[Q](Eq. 2) was used to determine the Stern-Volmer quenching constant Ksv. Fo and F are the fluorescence intensity in the absence and presence of the quencher (Q). Where this equation did not represent the data well, the modified Stern-Volmer equation (Eq. 3) was used to determine the accessibility of the tryptophan residues to the quencher. Fo/(Fo−F)=1/faKa[Q]+1/fa(Eq. 3) Therefore, a plot of Fo/(Fo - F) against 1/(Q) has a slope equal to 1/faKa and an intercept equal to 1/fa. In this case, Ka is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant for the accessible fraction of the tryptophan residues, and fa is the fraction of the initial fluorescence, which is accessible to the quencher.Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the E9 DNase were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Jasco Peltier temperature controller (PFD-4255). Spectra were recorded in a 10-mm path length cuvette at a scan speed of 100 nm min-1, with a response time of 1 s and with the spectral bandwidth set to 1 nm. Measurements in the far-UV (190-300 nm) were recorded in 10 mm KPi, pH 7.5 at a protein concentration of 0.5 μm. The spectra obtained were the average of 10 scans with baseline subtraction.Proteolysis—Tryptic digests of the E9 DNase domain were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at an E9 DNase concentration of 1 mg ml-1 and a trypsin concentration of 20 μg ml-1 at 37 °C. Zn2+ was present in slight molar excess (1.2:1) with DOPC or DOPG vesicles at 330 μm where indicated. Samples were removed at the times indicated, and proteolysis was stopped by the addition of an excess of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The products of proteolysis were analyzed by SDS-16% PAGE.RESULTSE9 DNase Specifically Interacts with Negatively Charged Phospholipid Vesicles—In aqueous solution close to neutral pH, the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum of the E9 DNase shows a maximum value (λmax) of 333 nm, indicating that its two tryptophan residues are substantially buried in the interior of the protein. The intrinsic fluorescence of the E9 DNase is very sensitive to ligand-binding events, to the extent that binding at the immunity protein exosite and active site can be distinguished (12Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13743-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Pommer A.J. Kühlmann U.C. Cooper A. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27153-27160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Complex formation with immunity protein at the exosite gives rise to an enhancement in its intrinsic fluorescence, whereas binding of either transition metals or DNA at the active site of the protein quench the intrinsic fluorescence. Hence, fluorescence was used to monitor the effects of lipids on the E9 DNase.Fluorescence spectra of the E9 DNase in the presence and absence of DOPG are shown in Fig. 1A. The spectra were recorded at a protein concentration of 1 μm and a lipid:protein ratio of 150. We found that the addition of negatively charged DOPG phospholipid vesicles to the E9 DNase at pH 7.5 gave rise to a significant red-shift in the λmax of the fluorescence of the protein that was not observed with neutral DOPC vesicles (data not shown). Interestingly, in addition to the shift in λmax, a reduction in the fluorescence signal was also observed after the addition of DOPG. The change in λmax for DOPG-treated DNase to 346 nm indicated a significant change in the environment of the tryptophan residues, as observed in protein denaturation. However, DOPG-treated DNase is not the unfolded state of the protein because it differs significantly from that induced by pH or urea denaturation (Fig. 1A).The shift in λmax was found to be approximately linearly dependent upon the molar lipid:protein ratio (RL-P) with DOPG vesicles, up to an RL-P value of around 100, with the addition of further DOPG having little effect on the value of the λmax (Fig. 1B). Increasing the E9 DNase concentration 5-fold to 1 μm showed that the change in λmax is independent of the total lipid concentration and dependent only upon the lipid:protein ratio (data not shown). With neutral DOPC vesicles, no change in λmax was observed up to a lipid:protein ratio of 500, indicating a strong electrostatic contribution to the protein-lipid interaction with DOPG. Using mixed phospholipid vesicles consisting of equimolar amounts of DOPC and DOPG, we observed a similar dependence of the λmax upon the value of RL-P with DOPG alone, but with a reduced effect upon the total change of the λmax (Fig. 1B).Probing the Structure of the Protein-lipid Complex by Fluorescence Quenching—At pH 4.0, near-UV CD indicates that the E9 DNase does not possess a well defined tertiary structure, whereas far-UV CD indicates only subtle changes in secondary structure compared with the protein at neutral pH (24van den Bremer E.T.J. Jiskoot W. James R. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Heck A.J.R. Maier C.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1738-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The absence of persistent tertiary structure for the E9 DNase at pH 4.0 is confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy, where λmax is red-shifted from 333 to 354 nm, indicating complete solvent exposure of the two tryptophans (Fig. 1A). Upon the addition of DOPG phospholipids at pH 4.0 (RL-P = 150), we found that there was a significant blue-shift to ∼341 nm, but there was no shift in the λmax upon addition of DOPC (data not shown). Not only does this illustrate that complexation between the E9 DNase and phospholipids does not require defined tertiary structure, but it implies that electrostatics are the likely basis for this association. We return to this issue in “Discussion.”The λmax in the presence of DOPG at pH 4.0 is similar to that observed upon addition of DOPG to the E9 DNase at pH 7.5 (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the solvent accessibility of the tryptophans in the final protein-lipid complex is similar at both pHs. This is supported by fluorescence-quenching experiments in the presence and absence of DOPG vesicles with the water-soluble quencher acrylamide at pH 4.0 and 7.5. Fig. 2 shows Stern-Volmer plots for the E9 DNase under these conditions. In the case of E9 DNase in solution at pH 4.0, the Stern-Volmer plot displayed a downward curvature (Fig. 2A); therefore, a modified Stern-Volmer plot was used (Fig. 2B). As expected, the accessibility of the E9 DNase tryptophan residues to acrylamide at pH 4.0 (Ka = 11 m-1), where the protein is unfolded, is much greater than in the folded state at pH 7.5 (Ksv = 2.7 ± 0.1 m-1). However, in the presence of DOPG vesicles at pH 4.0, the accessibility to acrylamide decreases to a value similar to that of the folded protein (K = 2.3 ± 0.1 m-1) and is very similar to that of the E9 DNase in the presence of DOPG vesicles at pH 7.5 (Ksv = 2.1 ± 0.1 m-1). These data are consistent with the E9 DNase forming non-voltage gated channels in planar lipid bilayers both at pH 4.0 and pH 7.5 and indicates that the protein does not have to be in its native conformation to interact with membranes. 2K.

However, it has been shown previously that binding of a stoichiometric amount of Zn2+ causes a considerable increase in the conformational stability of the E9 DNase (19Pommer A.J. Kühlmann U.C.

This is manifest by an increase of 22 °C (from 37 to 59 °C) in the melting temperature of the protein at pH 7.5, a considerable decrease in the susceptibility of the protein to proteolysis, and a decrease in affinity of the protein for the hydrophobic dye ANS (19Pommer A.J.

In view of these differences, we performed a similar experiment to that described in Fig. 1B in the presence of zinc (Fig. 3A). We found no difference in the change in λmax between the zinc-bound form and the metal-free protein upon association with DOPG vesicles, showing that the ability of the E9 DNase to bind negatively charged phospholipids is not affected by the conformational stability of the protein. This result is also consistent with the observation that the presence of bound zinc has no effect upon the ability of the E9 DNase to form channels in planar lipid bilayers (10Mosbahi K. Lemaître C. Keeble A.H. Mobasheri H. Morel B. James R. Moore G.R. Lea E.J. Kleanthous C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The E9 DNase forms a high affinity complex with its cognate immunity protein Im9 (12Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13743-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The formation of this heterodimeric complex has been shown previously to prevent channel formation by the E9 DNase in planar lipid bilayers (10Mosbahi K. Lemaître C. Keeble A.H. Mobasheri H. Morel B. James R. Moore G.R. Lea E.J. Kleanthous C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we observed no change in the λmax of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex (∼330 nm) upon addition of DOPG vesicles at an RL-P = 150 (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we infer that the presence of the immunity protein prevents the formation of a protein-lipid complex.Fig. 3Effect of ligand binding on E9 DNase interactions with phospholipid vesicles.A, changes in the intrinsic fluorescence emission maxima (λmax) of the E9 DNase on lipid:protein molar ratio, in the presence and absence of zinc bound to the protein.

Enhanced cleavage of such base modifications by topoisomerase II has been demonstrated in vitro, but it is unclear what will arise from an interplay of these mechanisms in the genome of a living cell exposed to UV light. To address this question, we have subjected cells expressing biofluorescent topoisomerase IIα or IIβ to DNA base modifications inflicted by a UVA laser at 364 nm through a confocal microscope in a locally confined manner. At DNA sites thus irradiated, we observed rapid, long term (>90 min) accumulation of topoisomerase IIα and IIβ, which was accompanied by a decrease in mobility but not immobilization of the enzyme. The catalytic topoisomerase II inhibitor ICRF-187 prevented the effect when added to the cell culture before the UVA pulse but promoted it when added thereafter. Self-primed in situ extension with rhodamine-dUTP revealed massive DNA breakage at the UVA-exposed spot. Culturing the cells with ICRF-187 before UVA-exposure prevented such breaks. In conclusion, we show in a living cell nucleus that UVA-modified DNA is preferentially targeted and processed by topoisomerase IIα and IIβ. This results in increased levels of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks, but formation of immobile, stable topoisomerase II·DNA intermediates is not notably promoted. Inhibition of topoisomerase II activity by ICRF-187 greatly diminishes UVA-induced DNA breakage, implying topoisomerase IIα and IIβ as endogenous co-factors modulating and possibly aggravating the impact of UVA light on the genome.

Type II DNA topoisomerases cleave both strands of the DNA double helix, pass other double-stranded DNA segments through the transient gaps, and religate the DNA (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). These enzymes play a rather ambivalent role in the homeostasis of the mammalian genome. They are essential for chromosome condensation and the separation of sister chromatids (3DiNardo S. Voelkel K. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 4Grue P. Gräβer A. Sehested M. Jensen P.B. Uhse A. Straub T. Ness W. Boege F. J. Biol.

At the same time, they endanger genomic integrity by producing double-stranded DNA breaks, to the 5′-ends of which they are covalently attached. The half-life of such covalent catalytic intermediates determines whether type II topoisomerases act beneficial or detrimental (5Froelich-Ammon S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Certain anti-cancer agents stabilize the intermediate state, thus accumulating topoisomerase II (topo II) 1The abbreviations used are: topo, DNA topoisomerase; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: topo, DNA topoisomerase; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; GFP, green fluorescent protein.-linked, double-stranded DNA breaks in the genome (6Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Such drugs (e.g. VM 26) are termed topo II poisons, as opposed to catalytic topo II inhibitors (e.g. ICRF-187), which prevent reopening of the topo II clamp after religation, thus stabilizing a state of the enzyme non-covalently bound to intact DNA (7Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The effect of topo II poisons seems mimicked by various DNA base modifications (8Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Sabourin M. Osheroff N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46290-46296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which also enhance DNA cleavage by topo II in vitro. Solar UVA light produces a similar spectrum of DNA base modifications via photo-oxidation processes (11Ravanat J.L. Douki T. Cadet J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 2001; 63: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) and/or direct photon-absorption (12Rochette P.J. Therrien J.P. Drouin R. Perdiz D. Bastien N. Drobetsky E.A. Sage E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2786-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and, thus, could likewise modify the processing of the genome by topo II.To test this hypothesis, we irradiated small nuclear areas of living cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-linked topo IIα or IIβ (13Christensen M.O. Larsen M.K. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R. Andersen C.L. Kjeldsen E. Knudsen B.R. Westergaard O. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) with defined doses of UVA light by use of an argon ion laser of a confocal microscope. At these sites, we observed rapid, long term accumulation and reduced mobility of topo II, as well as massive DNA breakage, which could be abolished by pretreatment with the catalytic topo II inhibitor ICRF-187. Our data suggest an important role for topo II in transducing the impact of UVA light on the genome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Microscopy—Fully functional chimera of topo IIα or IIβ and GFP were stably expressed at physiological levels in HEK 293 cells (13Christensen M.O. Larsen M.K. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R. Andersen C.L. Kjeldsen E. Knudsen B.R. Westergaard O. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Cultivation of transfected cells under an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurement of GFP chimera were done as described in Ref. 13Christensen M.O. Larsen M.K. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R. Andersen C.L. Kjeldsen E. Knudsen B.R. Westergaard O. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar. For quantification, the green fluorescence signal in the irradiated area was measured and its relative fluorescence intensity Irel was calculated as described previously (14Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Nonlinear regression analysis of FRAP kinetics was done as described previously (15Christensen M. Barthelmes H. Feineis S. Knudsen B. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).UVA irradiation was inflicted through a UV-permissive oil immersion objective (40×/1.3 NA Plan-NeoFluar®; Zeiss). In a cell nucleus, a circular area of 0.5-μm diameter was defined with the aid of the bleach software of the microscope and irradiated by the 364 nm line of an argon Laser. Light dose was measured at the objective tip with a LP-0101 detector head consisting of an integrated sphere with a diode (Gigahertz-Optik, Puchheim, Germany). It accumulated to 5 × 105 kJ m–2 when 500-fold iterated bleach pulses at 80-milliwatt nominal laser power were applied to obtain a significant accumulation of topo IIα-GFP. Unless stated otherwise, experiments were carried out with this dose, which has a similar genotoxic potential as 10 kJ m–2 of UVB, and is about 100-fold higher than a minimal erythemal dose of natural solar UVA light (16Drobetsky E.A. Turcotte J. Chateauneuf A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).Self-primed in Situ Labeling of Topo II Cut Sites (Topo-SPRINS)— The assay was developed to visualize topo II-induced DNA strand breaks on spread chromosomes (17Andersen C.L. Wandall A. Kjeldsen E. Mielke C. Koch J. Chromosome Res. 2002; 10: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In principle, it is a PRINS reaction carried out in the absence of sequence-specific primers. Instead, the required, free 3′-ends formed transiently in cleavage complexes of topo II and DNA are first irreversibly fixed and then extended by DNA polymerase in the presence of rhodamine-labeled nucleotides. To apply the assay to interphase nuclei instead of chromosomes, cells were grown on cover slides and fixed with methanol. Single-stranded DNA breaks, which are generated by UVA light itself (18Douki T. Reynaud-Angelin A. Cadet J. Sage E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9221-9226Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) or the fixation procedure, were sealed with DNA ligase (Quick T4 DNA Ligase, New England Biolabs). Topo II-generated breaks are not religated, because the enzyme remains covalently attached to the 5′-end of the break. Therefore, they were the only DNA breaks to be labeled subsequently by incubating specimen for 30 min at 65 °C with 50 μl of reaction mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μgml–2 bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, 8.7% glycerol, 100 μm dATP, 100 μm dCTP, 100 μm dGTP, 65 μm dTTP, 35 μm tetramethylrhodamine-5-dUTP, 2 units of Tth DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics)). The reaction was stopped (4× SSC, 50 mm EDTA), and cells were then intensively washed (4× SSC, 0.05% Tween 20) and mounted for microscopy.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo test the impact of UVA radiation on the disposition of topo II in living cells, we irradiated cells expressing GFP-linked topo IIα or IIβ (13Christensen M.O. Larsen M.K. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R. Andersen C.L. Kjeldsen E. Knudsen B.R. Westergaard O. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) with defined doses of UVA light. The cells were cultured under a confocal microscope, and an argon ion laser (λ = 364 nm) was focused through the objective at confined areas of cell nuclei. Monitoring of GFP fluorescence after the UVA pulse showed a long term (>1.5 h) accumulation of topo II at the UVA-exposed site (Fig. 1). Accumulation started immediately after irradiation and increased gradually until a steady state was reached after 100–150 s (Fig. 2A). The extent of the process (2–3-fold above initial nucleoplasmic level) was clearly related to light dose (Fig. 2A, inset), and its gradual onset allowed ruling out UVA-induced DNA-protein cross-linking, which occurs instantaneously. To exclude the possibility that accumulation was due to the aggregation of oxidized enzyme molecules, we repeated the experiment at mitosis, focusing the UVA laser either at the chromosomal plate (Fig. 2B, left) or the cytosol (right). If accumulation was due to aggregation of oxidized enzyme molecules, it should likewise occur in chromosomes and cytosol. However, accumulation was only seen when the focus of UVA irradiation was within the chromosomal plate not when it was directed at a cytosolic area. This difference was most notable with topo IIβ-GFP (Fig. 2B, bottom), which at mitosis is evenly distributed between chromosomes and cytosol (13Christensen M.O. Larsen M.K. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R. Andersen C.L. Kjeldsen E. Knudsen B.R. Westergaard O. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, aggregation of oxidized protein clusters could be ruled out. This observation made it also unlikely that topo II was attracted to UVA lesions due to its plausible involvement in repair processes (19Hickson I.D. Davies S.L. Davies S.M. Robson C.N. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1990; 58: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Stevnsner T. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1841-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), since these are supposed to be inactive during mitosis. Therefore, the most likely interpretation of the observed DNA dependence of topo II accumulation was an enhanced processing of UVA damaged DNA by the enzyme. We tested this assumption subsequently by analyzing the mobility of the enzyme in the UV-irradiated area using photobleaching techniques.Fig. 2UVA-induced accumulation of topo II proceeds gradually, depends on light-dose and the presence of DNA, and results from a reduced mobility of the enzyme. A, cells expressing topo IIα-GFP or IIβ-GFP were UVA-irradiated at the indicated spot for 30.7 s. Top, images taken before and at the indicated time points after irradiation. Bottom, fluorescence intensity in the irradiated region was measured and plotted as relative increase over time (▵, IIα; □, IIβ). Inset, quantitative values for topo IIα-GFP accumulation in a spot irradiated for 30.7 s (▵), 21.5 s (○), or 12.3 s (⋄), corresponding to UVA doses of 5×, 3.5×, or 2 × 105 kJ m–2, respectively. B, cells in metaphase expressing topo IIα-GFP (top) or IIβ-GFP (bottom) were imaged before and 100 s after irradiation of a chromosomal (left) or a cytoplasmic area (right). Brackets mark metaphase chromosomes. C, FRAP analysis of cells expressing topo IIα-GFP. Cells were left untreated (top), UVA-irradiated (middle), or exposed to a final concentration of 100 μm ICRF-187 (bottom; note the nucleolar de-localization of topo IIα-GFP due to drug-induced trapping of the enzyme to genomic DNA cut sites in the nucleoplasm (13Christensen M.O. Larsen M.K. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R. Andersen C.L. Kjeldsen E. Knudsen B.R. Westergaard O. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)). Then, a defined area (white circles; Ø = 1 μm) in the nucleoplasm of ICRF-treated or untreated cells, or in the UV-exposed area of irradiated cells, was bleached. Top, images taken before and at selected time points after the bleach pulse; bottom, fluorescence intensities in the bleach spot plotted as relative recovery over time (▵, untreated; □, UVA-exposed spot; ○, ICRF-treated; thin solid lines, all data points; hatched lines, non-linear regression of the data).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The mobility of some biofluorescent DNA-binding proteins has been analyzed in the living cell nucleus by nonlinear regression analysis of kinetics of FRAP. These studies revealed fast and slow states of the proteins that coexist and are interconvertible (15Christensen M. Barthelmes H. Feineis S. Knudsen B. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Hoogstraten D. Nigg A.L. Heath H. Mullenders L.H. van Driel R. Hoeijmakers J.H. Vermeulen W. Houtsmuller A.B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1163-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the case of topo I, the slow state could be assigned to enzyme engaged in DNA turnover, since stabilization of the DNA-bound enzyme form by camptothecin increased both amount and half-time of the slow fraction, whereas the fast fraction was not affected (15Christensen M. Barthelmes H. Feineis S. Knudsen B. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When comparing here by a similar approach the impact of DNA damage on topo IIα-GFP (Fig. 2C), we found the enzyme less mobile in UVA-exposed areas (Fig. 2C, squares) than in corresponding areas not irradiated (Fig. 2C, triangles). Upon preincubation with ICRF-187 (Fig. 2C, circles), the enzyme became even more retarded in the nucleoplasm, confirming that the catalytic inhibitor prevents dissociation from DNA subsequent to religation (7Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Nonlinear regression analysis (hatched lines in Fig. 2C) indicated two fractions of fluorescent molecules with different mobility contributing to each set of data. In the normal situation (cells neither irradiated with UVA nor treated with ICRF; Fig. 2C, triangles), significantly (p < 0.002) best fits were achieved by assuming 86% of the enzyme in a fast (t½ = 1.3 s) and 14% in a slow state (t½ = 19 s). In UVA-irradiated areas (Fig. 2C, squares), the slow fraction increased to 35% and became further retarded (t½ = 41 s), whereas ICRF treatment (Fig. 3, circles) immobilized (t½ > 700 s) most of the enzyme molecules (73%). These and similar observations made with cells expressing topo IIβ-GFP (not shown) suggest that type II topoisomerases accumulate at UVA-irradiated DNA sites because there they are less mobile. The most likely interpretation of this finding is that the enzymes bind either directly to the damaged DNA or to other proteins recognizing the lesions.Fig. 3The catalytic topo II inhibitor ICRF-187 traps the enzyme on UVA-exposed, genomic DNA. A cell expressing topo IIα-GFP was imaged before and every 3.1 s after UVA irradiation of the indicated area. 5 min after irradiation, ICRF-187 (100 μm final concentration) was added to the culture medium and imaging continued for another 10 min. Top, images of an irradiated (left) and an untreated cell (right) before and after irradiation (the complete sequence of events can be viewed in the supplementary QuickTime movie). Bottom, increase in fluorescence intensity in the UVA-exposed spot plotted over time. Scale bar, 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interestingly, recovery kinetics in Fig. 2C show that in the UVA-irradiated area topo II is retarded but not immobilized, since the corresponding FRAP curve (squares) fully recovered to initial intensity within about 3 min (in untreated areas recovery was complete after ∼1 min). This demonstrates that UVA-induced DNA damage clearly does not promote long lasting, covalent entrapment of topo II on chromosomal DNA in the same manner, as does topo II poisoning (Fig. 2C, circles, and Ref. 13Christensen M.O. Larsen M.K. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R. Andersen C.L. Kjeldsen E. Knudsen B.R. Westergaard O. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Instead, topo II accumulation at UVA lesions obviously reflects a transient interaction, which may explain why a related assay for isolating in vivo complexes of topo II to DNA readily detects drug-induced enzyme·DNA covalent complexes (22Subramanian D. Furbee C.S. Muller M.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar) but not an UVB-induced association of topo II with irradiated, cellular DNA (23Subramanian D. Rosenstein B.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 976-984PubMed Google Scholar).To check whether topo II was catalytically active at all in the irradiated area, we added ICRF-187 after the UVA pulse, thus trapping the enzyme preferentially in those places where it has gone through the entire catalytic cycle. Fig. 3 (and the supplementary QuickTime movie) shows that ICRF-187 greatly enhanced accumulation of topo IIα-GFP and IIβ-GFP (not shown) in the UVA-irradiated area, suggesting an increased catalytic interaction of topo II with UVA-exposed, chromosomal DNA. In the absence of ICRF-187, this enhanced activity should generate an increase in topo II-generated DNA cuts at UVA-irradiated sites, even if the catalytic cycle of the enzyme is not altered by light-induced modifications of the substrate.To corroborate this deduction, we employed self-primed in situ extension of topo II cut sites with fluorescent nucleotides (17Andersen C.L. Wandall A. Kjeldsen E. Mielke C. Koch J. Chromosome Res. 2002; 10: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which was adapted to visualize those DNA sites that are actually cleaved by topo II in an interphase nucleus. A normal result is shown in Fig. 4A, row 1; topo IIα-GFP resides mostly in the nucleoli with hardly any incorporation of rhodamine-dUTP in the nucleoplasm. Row 2 shows the effect of a typical topo II poison (VM 26). When cells were cultured with VM 26 (20 μm) for 10 min before fixation, topo IIα-GFP became almost completely de-localized from nucleoli, due to the drug trapping the enzyme in covalent DNA bonds at genomic DNA cut sites in the nucleoplasm (13Christensen M.O. Larsen M.K. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R. Andersen C.L. Kjeldsen E. Knudsen B.R. Westergaard O. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Incorporation of rhodamine-dUTP was significantly enhanced at exactly those sites, where topo II had been trapped by VM 26 (row 2, compare middle left and right images), confirming that the assay visualizes topo II-linked DNA breaks. The control experiment shown in row 3, where VM 26-pretreated cells were assayed without DNA polymerase added, demonstrates that the nucleolar and cytoplasmic staining by rhodamine-dUTP is due to a nonspecific binding of the fluorescent nucleotide to these structures. In Fig. 4B (top), a confined area of the cell nucleus was irradiated with UVA before performing the reaction. As expected, the irradiated area was clearly accentuated by accumulation of green fluorescent topo IIα-GFP (middle left). However, the intense incorporation of rhodamine-dUTP (middle right) at exactly the same site of topo IIα-GFP accumulation gives a clear indication of massive DNA breakage. To ascertain that the DNA breaks were not only co-localized and coincident with topo IIα-GFP, but actually mediated by the enzyme, the cellular complement of topo II was immobilized with ICRF-187 in the non-covalently DNA-bound form prior to UVA irradiation (Fig. 4B, bottom). This prevented accumulation of topo IIα-GFP at the UVA-irradiated site (middle left image) and blocked incorporation of rhodamine-dUTP into the UVA-exposed area (middle right), indicating that rhodamine-dUTP incorporation in the absence of ICRF-187 must have been entirely due to extension of topo II-mediated DNA cuts. In other words, UVA-irradiation required active topo II as a co-factor to induce the DNA breakage detectable by the assay.Fig. 4UVA-induced DNA breaks are mediated by topo II. Cells expressing topo IIα-GFP were fixed, unspecific single strand breaks were religated, and free 3′-ends of topo II-generated DNA strand breaks were labeled by DNA polymerase-mediated incorporation of rhodamine-dUTP (middle right). Corresponding phase contrast images (left), GFP fluorescence (middle left), and a merged image of GFP and rhodamine fluorescence (right) are shown. A, cells were either left untreated (top) or were treated with the topo II inhibitor VM 26 for 15 min before fixation (middle and bottom). In the bottom row, DNA polymerase was omitted in addition to reveal unspecific staining. B, cells were grown on a microscopic grid to enable identification of individual cells after the topo-SPRINS assay. A selected cell was exposed to UVA irradiation in the indicated area (white circle in the phase contrast image). 5 min later, cells were fixed and assayed as above. Arrowheads mark the UVA-irradiated spot. The bottom row shows a cell pretreated with 100 μm ICRF-187 for 10 min before irradiation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Our findings do not allow direct deductions as to the mechanistic impact of UVA lesions on the catalytic cycle of topo II. Previous investigations using UVC irradiation to introduce mainly cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) into plasmid DNA in vitro revealed that the DNA strand passage step of the catalytic cycle of Drosophila topo II is inhibited by the alteration of the DNA substrate, whereas the cleavage/religation equilibrium is not affected (24Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Lloyd R.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While CPDs are likely to constitute a substantial part of all lesions induced by UVA (12Rochette P.J. Therrien J.P. Drouin R. Perdiz D. Bastien N. Drobetsky E.A. Sage E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2786-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), a variety of other DNA modifications are also introduced into cellular DNA by UVA light, albeit to an extent still disputed (11Ravanat J.L. Douki T. Cadet J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 2001; 63: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Of these, oxidative lesions were found to slightly enhance topo II cleavage when introduced into selected sites in oligonucleotide substrates (9Sabourin M. Osheroff N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In summary, it is clear that solar UVA irradiation leads to various DNA base modifications and that topoisomerases are major non-repair proteins that bind to modified DNA bases in vitro (8Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Cline S.D. Hanawalt P.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Here, we provide plausible evidence showing that, in the cellular environment, DNA processing by topo II is greatly enhanced at genomic sites exposed to UVA light, which leads to a net increase in topo II-mediated DNA cleavage. Actually, DNA breakage at UVA-exposed DNA sites seems to a major part mediated by topo II, since it can be more or less abolished by catalytic topo II inhibitors such as ICRF-187 (Fig. 4B). Thus, topo II is indicated as an endogenous cofactor converting DNA base modifications into DNA strand breaks. This may have far reaching implications for carcinogenesis and cell aging, biological processes believed to follow from damage of nuclear and/or mitochondrial DNA by reactive oxygen species generated in the course of solar UVA exposure and/or energy metabolism (26Berneburg M.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and cell aging (28Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3094) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is unclear why different tissues and cell types are affected differently by a similar burden of oxidative stress (29Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 854: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). If topo II was an important endogenous cofactor determining the over all effect of DNA base modifications on the genome, as implied by the data presented here, then the cellular level of topo II should determine the extent to which exposure to sunlight and oxidative stress becomes translated into genomic degeneration. Type II DNA topoisomerases cleave both strands of the DNA double helix, pass other double-stranded DNA segments through the transient gaps, and religate the DNA (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). These enzymes play a rather ambivalent role in the homeostasis of the mammalian genome. They are essential for chromosome condensation and the separation of sister chromatids (3DiNardo S. Voelkel K.
