A prototype telescope system with six movable elements has successfully corrected these phase perturbations. This use of real-time image sharpening has restored stellar images to the diffraction limit (in one dimension) for a 30-centimeter telescope. The double-star image presented indicates that the bulk of the atmospherically induced wave-front phase change occurred within 2 kilometers of the telescope. This implies that, at least for conditions similar to those of our measurement, real-time correction can be accomplished simultaneously for a region at least several arc seconds in angular size. With the present apparatus the technique should be practical for objects as dim as fifth magnitude, and with improvements the technique holds the promise of active image restoration for objects as dim as ninth magnitude."

Noyes, director of the Gates Chemical Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, to investigate the chemical and other properties of insulin in his laboratory under a grant from the Carnegie Foundation. Commercial insulin as prepared by the Lilly Research Laboratories of Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, has served as the material for our investigation. Two forms of commercial insulin have been used by us; one a dry powder evaluated at approximately 8 rabbit units per milligram; the second a highly concentrated aqueous solution (2.44 per cent. solids) containing approximately 300 rabbit units per cubic centimeter, and with 120 milligrams of hydrochloric acid per 100 cubic centimeters."

It was long past noon when I realised that the return journey would be equally long and tiring. Camp lay on the other side of a long range of hills, and there was a short cut from the main trail that would save several miles, but this trail was faint. I reached the supposed cut-off about dusk and followed it upward. Darkness came on swiftly, and my pony began to stumble. Somewhere we had missed the trail, for at intervals I could still glimpse the crest of the hills, and I knew my general direction."

https://openalex.org/W4248396151,"IN a recently published volume on ""The Origin of Submarine Canyons"" the writer inadvertently credited to A. C. Veatch an excerpt from a submarine chart actually contoured by P. A. Smith, of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. The chart in question is Chart IVB of Special Paper No. 7 of the Geological Society of America entitled ""Atlantic Submarine Valleys of the United States and the Congo Submarine Valley, by A. C. Veatch and P. A. Smith,"" and the excerpt appears as Plate III of the volume fist cited above. In view of the heavy labor involved in contouring the charts accompanying the paper by Veatch and Smith and the beauty of the finished product, it would be unfair to Mr. Smith to permit the error to go uncorrected. Excerpts from two other charts are correctly ascribed to Dr. Veatch."
