https://openalex.org/W1562263022,"Inflammation is widely distributed in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and ultimately leads to progressive deterioration of muscle function with chronic muscle damage, oxidative stress, and reduced oxidative capacity. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a critical role in defending against inflammation in different tissues via activation of phase II enzyme heme oxygenase-1 and inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway. However, the role of Nrf2 in the inflammation of dystrophic muscle remains unknown. To determine whether Nrf2 may counteract inflammation in dystrophic muscle, we treated 4-week-old male mdx mice with the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane (SFN) by gavage (2 mg/kg of body weight/day) for 4 weeks. The experimental results demonstrated that SFN treatment increased the expression of muscle phase II enzyme heme oxygenase-1 in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Inflammation in mice was reduced by SFN treatment as indicated by decreased infiltration of immune cells and expression of the inflammatory cytokine CD45 and proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 in the skeletal muscles of mdx mice. In addition, SFN treatment also decreased the expression of NF-κB(p65) and phosphorylated IκB kinase-α as well as increased inhibitor of κB-α expression in mdx mice in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Collectively, these results show that SFN-induced Nrf2 can alleviate muscle inflammation in mdx mice by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1765608416,"Cathelicidins are a family of gene-encoded peptide effectors of innate immunity found exclusively in vertebrates. They play pivotal roles in host immune defense against microbial invasions. Dozens of cathelicidins have been identified from several vertebrate species. However, no cathelicidin from marine reptiles has been characterized previously. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel cathelicidin (Hc-CATH) from the sea snake Hydrophis cyanocinctus. Hc-CATH is composed of 30 amino acids, and the sequence is KFFKRLLKSVRRAVKKFRKKPRLIGLSTLL. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and structure modeling analysis indicated that Hc-CATH mainly assumes an amphipathic α-helical conformation in bacterial membrane-mimetic solutions. It possesses potent broad-spectrum and rapid antimicrobial activity. Meanwhile, it is highly stable and shows low cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. The microbial killing activity of Hc-CATH is executed through the disruption of cell membrane and lysis of bacterial cells. In addition, Hc-CATH exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Hc-CATH directly binds with LPS to neutralize its toxicity, and it also binds to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4/MD2 complex), which therefore inhibits the binding of LPS to TLR4/MD2 complex and the subsequent activation of LPS-induced inflammatory response pathways. Taken together, our study demonstrates that Hc-CATH, the first cathelicidin from sea snake discovered to have both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, is a potent candidate for the development of peptide antibiotics.

Living in an environment surrounded by diverse microorganisms, multicellular organisms are constantly threatened by the invasion of microbial pathogens (1Zasloff M. Antimicrobial peptides of multicellular organisms.Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6743) Google Scholar). The discovery of antibiotics has been one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine, and their widespread use has saved countless patients from lethal infections (2Theuretzbacher U. Toney J.H. Nature's clarion call of antibacterial resistance: are we listening?.Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2006; 7: 158-166PubMed Google Scholar). However, the excessive use of antibiotics has simultaneously prompted the evolution of microbial pathogens, resulting in a large-scale emergence of drug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Meanwhile, rate of development for novel antimicrobial drugs have been declining (3Spellberg B. Powers J.H. Brass E.P. Miller L.G. Edwards Jr., J.E. Trends in antimicrobial drug development: implications for the future.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2004; 38: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The human immune system is composed of two branches, innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against microbial infection (4Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity.Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8720) Google Scholar, 5Tosi M.F. Innate immune responses to infection.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2005; 116: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Innate immunity recognizes invading pathogens via germ line-encoded pattern recognition receptors, activates specific signaling pathways such as TLRs 4The abbreviations used are: TLRtoll-like receptorAMPantimicrobial peptideMPMmouse peritoneal macrophageqRT-PCRquantitative real-time PCRMSTmicroscale thermophoresisMICminimal inhibitory concentrationHc-CATHcathelicidin from Hydrophis cyanocinctusTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinePE-TLR4phycoerythrin-TLR4MTT3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromideiNOSinducible nitric-oxide synthaseLALlimulus amebocyte lysate. and NOD-like receptors, and ultimately leads to the generation of local inflammation at the site of pathogenic infection (4Akira S.

Innate immune responses to infection.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2005; 116: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Local inflammation plays an important role in the early stage of invading pathogen eradication. Therefore, modulation of innate immunity is regarded as an attractive approach to anti-infective therapy for its potential broader applications and the slight possibility of inducing microbial resistance (6Scott M.G. Dullaghan E. Mookherjee N. Glavas N. Waldbrook M. Thompson A. Wang A. Lee K. Doria S. Hamill P. Yu J.J. Li Y. Donini O. Guarna M.M. Finlay B.B. North J.R. Hancock R.E.

Can innate immunity be enhanced to treat microbial infections?.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, hyperactivation of the innate immunity may lead to excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and sepsis, which cause massive damage to the host and even death (6Scott M.G. Dullaghan E. Mookherjee N. Glavas N. Waldbrook M. Thompson A. Wang A. Lee K. Doria S. Hamill P. Yu J.J. Li Y. Donini O. Guarna M.M. Finlay B.B. North J.R. Hancock R.E.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a large group of gene-encoded small peptides that have been identified in nearly all species of life and play critical roles in host innate immune response to microbial infections (1Zasloff M. Antimicrobial peptides of multicellular organisms.Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6743) Google Scholar, 9Radek K. Gallo R. Antimicrobial peptides: natural effectors of the innate immune system.Semin. Immunopathol. 2007; 29: 27-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). They are diverse in sequence and structure and can be divided broadly into several classes (10Brogden K.A. Antimicrobial peptides: pore formers or metabolic inhibitors in bacteria?.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4371) Google Scholar). However, they are generally amphipathic (containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches on the surface) and positively charged (rich in lysine and arginine residues) (10Brogden K.A. Antimicrobial peptides: pore formers or metabolic inhibitors in bacteria?.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4371) Google Scholar, 11Nakatsuji T. Gallo R.L. Antimicrobial peptides: old molecules with new ideas.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2012; 132: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). AMPs typically have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, enveloped viruses, and even parasites (10Brogden K.A. Antimicrobial peptides: pore formers or metabolic inhibitors in bacteria?.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4371) Google Scholar, 11Nakatsuji T. Gallo R.L. Antimicrobial peptides: old molecules with new ideas.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2012; 132: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Besides direct antimicrobial activity, many AMPs also exhibit a variety of other functions, such as chemoattraction of immune cells, neutralization of LPS, wound healing promotion, and induction of angiogenesis (12Zaiou M. Multifunctional antimicrobial peptides: therapeutic targets in several human diseases.J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 13Bals R. Wilson J.M. Cathelicidins: a family of multifunctional antimicrobial peptides.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Therefore, in recent years AMPs have also been referred to as cationic host defense peptides, which more specifically refers to their multifunctional activities (14Mookherjee N. Hancock R.E. Cationic host defence peptides: innate immune regulatory peptides as a novel approach for treating infections.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Two major families of AMPs exist in vertebrates, namely defensins and cathelicidins. Whereas defensins are generally characterized by a common β-sheet core structure stabilized by three well defined disulfide bonds (15Ganz T. Defensins: antimicrobial peptides of innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar), the structures of cathelicidins are highly heterogeneous (16Zanetti M. Cathelicidins, multifunctional peptides of the innate immunity.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). However, cathelicidin precursors share a highly conserved signal peptide and “cathelin” domain at the N terminus. Consistent with other AMPs, most cathelicidins have direct killing activity against a wide range of microorganisms and are actively involved in various phases of host immunity modulation and disease resistance (16Zanetti M. Cathelicidins, multifunctional peptides of the innate immunity.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 17Zaiou M. Gallo R.L. Cathelicidins, essential gene-encoded mammalian antibiotics.J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, their microbial killing and immune modulating activities are more potent than most of the other AMPs characterized thus far. Because of their small size, low toxicity, high stability, and diverse mechanisms, they are deemed attractive candidates for anti-infective agent development (18Mookherjee N. Rehaume L.M. Hancock R.E. Cathelicidins and functional analogues as antisepsis molecules.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2007; 11: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Chow J.Y. Li Z.J. Wu W.K. Cho C.H. Cathelicidin a potential therapeutic peptide for gastrointestinal inflammation and cancer.World J. Gastroenterol. 2013; 19: 2731-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). There are three cathelicidin analogs being tested in clinical trials: Iseganan, Omiganan, and MBI 594AN (20Steinstraesser L. Kraneburg U. Jacobsen F. Al-Benna S. Host defense peptides and their antimicrobial-immunomodulatory duality.Immunobiology. 2011; 216: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To date, nine cathelicidins have been identified from terrestrial snakes, most of which exhibited potent antimicrobial activities (21Falcao C.B. de La Torre B.G. Pérez-Peinado C. Barron A.E. Andreu D. Rádis-Baptista G.

Zhang Y. Identification and characterization of novel reptile cathelicidins from elapid snakes.Peptides. 2008; 29: 1685-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, no cathelicidin has been identified from sea snakes. To verify the existence of cathelicidins in sea snakes and to discover more templates for peptide antibiotic design, we report the identification and characterization of a novel cathelicidin (Hc-CATH) from the sea snake Hydrophis cyanocinctus in this study. We show that Hc-CATH possesses potent broad-spectrum and rapid antimicrobial activity, high stability, low cytotoxicity, and strong anti-inflammatory activity, all of which make it a potent candidate for the development of novel peptide antibiotics. Adult specimens of H. cyanocinctus (n = 2, female, weight range 200–350 g) were collected from Beihai, Guangxi Province, China (21.482°N, 109.119°E). After collection, the snakes were killed, and the venom glands, spleen, lung, skin, and muscle were dissected immediately and frozen in liquid nitrogen until used. No specific permissions were required for the sampling location/activity, and the present study did not involve endangered or protected species. The animal experimental protocol in the present study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Ethics Committee of Soochow University. Total RNA of the snake venom glands (n = 2, weight range 0.35 to 0.5 g) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis was carried out by a PCR-based method using an In-Fusion SMARTerTM directional cDNA library construction kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). First-strand cDNA was synthesized by SMARTScribeTM reverse transcriptase (Clontech), and the primers used were SMARTer V oligonucleotide (5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTAXXXXX-3′, where X = undisclosed base in the proprietary SMARTer oligo sequence) and 3′-IF SMARTer CDS primer (5′-CGGGGTACGATGAGACACCATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTVN-3′, where N = A, C, G, or T and V = A, G, or C) supplied by the kit. Second-strand cDNA was amplified by a long-distance PCR method using Advantage 2 polymerase mix supplied by the kit, and the primers used were 5′-PCR Primer IIA (5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT) and 3′-IF SMARTer PCR primer (5′-CGGGGTACGATGAGACACCA-3′). The synthesized second-strand cDNAs was used as templates for the PCR-based cDNA screening described below. According to the highly conserved cathelin domain of previously characterized snake cathelicidins, a 3′ antisense primer (5′-CCCCTCCTCCTGCTTCTGCT-3′) was designed and coupled with the 5′ sense primer (5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3′) designed based on the SMARTer V oligonucleotide primer to screen the 5′ fragments of cDNAs encoding the cathelicidins of H. cyanocinctus. The PCR procedure was as follows: 5 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The last cycle was followed by an extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was purified by gel electrophoresis and cloned into pMD19-T vector (Takara, Japan) for sequencing. After the 5′ fragments of cDNAs were obtained, a sense primer (5′-GAGGATGCAAGGGTTCTTCTGG-3′) was designed according to the 5′ coding region and coupled with the 3′ antisense primer (5′-TACGCGACGCGATACGCGAAT-3′), designed based on the sequence of 3′-IF SMARTer CDS primer to screen the full-length cDNAs. The PCR procedure was as follows: 5 min at 94 °C and 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C. The last cycle was followed by an extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was also purified by gel electrophoresis and cloned into pMD19-T vector (Takara, Japan) for sequencing. The cathelicidin sequences used for multi-sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis were obtained from the protein database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Multi-sequence alignment was carried out using Clustal 2.1 and GeneDoc software. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the Neighbor-joining algorithm using the MEGA program (version 5.0). To avoid the mistakes caused by the diversity of mature peptides, we used the conserved signal peptide and cathelin domain to construct the phylogenetic tree. A total of 1000 bootstrap replicates were used to test the reliability of each branch. The numbers on the branches indicate the percentage of 1000 bootstrap samples supporting the branch (Fig. 3). The physical and chemical parameters of Hc-CATH were analyzed by using the ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal. The secondary structure of Hc-CATH was predicted by The PSIPRED (Protein Structure Prediction) server provided by the Bioinformatics Group of the Department of Computer Science, University College London. The helix-wheel plot was constructed using the software package provided by the Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) proteomics server. Structure modeling of Hc-CATH was conducted using a de novo design modeling method. Hc-CATH was searched and aligned in BLAST. The Rosetta ab initio protocol was used to predict the three-dimensional structure of Hc-CATH. 5000 decoys were obtained from the Rosetta ab initio prediction result. After clustering, the lowest energy structure of Hc-CATH was verified by PROCHECK. The three-dimensional structure generated was visualized by using PyMOL software without any refinement. Hc-CATH and its derivatives, isotype control sHc-CATH and FITC-labeled peptides (FITC conjugates to the N terminus of Hc-CATH and sHc-CATH), were synthesized by the peptide synthesizer GL Biochem Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Their physicochemical parameters are shown in Table 1. The synthetic peptides were purified and then analyzed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS to confirm that the purity was higher than 98%.TABLE 1Physicochemical parameters of Hc-CATH and its derivativesPeptideSequenceNet chargeTheoretical pIMrHc-CATHKFFKRLLKSVRRAVKKFRKKPRLIGLSTLL+1212.613628.5Hc-CATH1KFFARLLASVRAAVKKFRKKPRLIGLSTLL+912.493429.2Hc-CATH2AFFARLLASVRAAVKAFAKKPRLIGLSTLL+612.313229.9sHc-CATHLKKLKGRVSRSFLFFVKLRPAKRTLKKRIL+1212.613628.5 Open table in a new tab The synthetic Hc-CATH was used as the antigen to immunize C57 mice. The mouse serum was collected, and the polyclonal antibody of Hc-CATH was purified using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Several tissues including venom gland, spleen, lung, skin, and muscle were randomly selected, total proteins from which were extracted and separated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Western blot was performed using the prepared mouse Hc-CATH polyclonal antibody. A primary monoclonal antibody of mouse β-actin (Good-Science Biotech Co., Shanghai, China) was used as a control. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to evaluate the secondary structure of Hc-CATH in solvent environments. The CD spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer (Jasco). Samples were prepared by dissolving Hc-CATH to an ultimate concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in SDS/H2O solutions of different concentrations (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 mm). Spectra at 190–260 nm were measured; the instrument parameters were: 0.1 cm path-length cell, 1 nm bandwidth, 1 s response time, and a scan speed of 100 nm/min. For each sample, three consecutive scans were performed and averaged followed by subtraction of the solvent signal. To investigate the effect of salt and temperature on the structure of Hc-CATH, the secondary structures of Hc-CATH in NaCl solutions and at high temperatures were determined by CD spectroscopy. For the salt assay, Hc-CATH was dissolved in 60 mm SDS/H2O solution with serial concentrations of NaCl (0, 100, 200, and 400 mm) to an ultimate concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, and the CD spectra of these samples were measured. For the temperature assay, Hc-CATH was dissolved in 60 mm SDS/H2O solution to an ultimate concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The samples were incubated at different temperatures (20, 50, 70, and 90 °C) for 1 h, and then the CD spectra were recorded. To determine the antimicrobial potency of Hc-CATH, a 2-fold broth microdilution method was used as described in our previous work (24Wang Y. Zhang Z. Chen L. Guang H. Li Z. Yang H. Li J. You D. Yu H. Lai R. Cathelicidin-BF, a snake cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptide, could be an excellent therapeutic agent for acne vulgaris.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e22120Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 48 human pathogenic microbial strains (26 Gram-negative bacteria, 12 Gram-positive bacteria, and 10 fungi) were used in the present assay, in which the standard strains were stored in our laboratory and the clinical strains were collected from local hospitals. Briefly, microbes were incubated in Mueller-Hinton broth (MH broth) at 37 °C to exponential phase and diluted to 106 cfu/ml. A serial dilution of Hc-CATH was prepared in 96-well microtiter plates (50 μl) and mixed with equal volume of microbial inoculums (50 μl). The plates were put into a microbial incubator and shaken slowly (100 rpm) at 37 °C for 18 h. At the terminal point of incubation, the plates were put into an ELISA plate reader, and the growth of the microbe was determined by measuring the absorbance values (A) at 600 nm. The minimal concentrations at which no microbial growth occurred were recorded as MIC values. Two traditional antibiotics (ampicillin and meropenem) were used as positive controls. To determine the antimicrobial activity of Hc-CATH toward pathogens of sea snakes, 11 marine aquatic pathogenic bacteria were collected, and their sensitivity to Hc-CATH was determined. The bacteria were cultured in nutrient broth (Thermo Scientific), and the above described 2-fold broth microdilution method was used to determine the MIC values. The bacterial killing kinetic assay was carried out according to the method described previously with minor modifications (22Wang Y. Hong J. Liu X. Yang H. Liu R. Wu J. Wang A. Lin D. Lai R. Snake cathelicidin from Bungarus fasciatus is a potent peptide antibiotics.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli ATCC25922 was incubated in MH broth to exponential phase and diluted to 106 cfu/ml with fresh MH broth. Hc-CATH was added to the bacterial suspension to a final concentration of 5 × MIC (11.7 μg/ml), and the bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min. At each time point, 50-μl aliquots were extracted and diluted with fresh MH broth for 1000 times, and 50 μl of the dilution was coated on MH agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h, and the viable colonies were counted. Meropenem and sterile deionized water were used as the positive and blank control, respectively. Salt tolerance of Hc-CATH was examined as described previously (25Ling G. Gao J. Zhang S. Xie Z. Wei L. Yu H. Wang Y. Cathelicidins from the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana provides novel template for peptide antibiotic design.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e93216Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli ATCC25922 was incubated in MH broth to exponential phase and diluted to 106 cfu/ml in fresh MH broth with sodium chloride at final concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 400 mm, respectively. Serial dilutions of Hc-CATH prepared with the same MH broth were added to the E. coli ATCC25922 suspension. The bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h, and the MIC values of Hc-CATH against E. coli ATCC25922 in the presence of different concentrations of sodium chloride were determined. Thermal tolerance of Hc-CATH was determined by measuring MIC values of Hc-CATH against E. coli ATCC25922 after incubated at different temperatures. The experiment was carried out as previously described (25Ling G. Gao J. Zhang S. Xie Z. Wei L. Yu H. Wang Y. Cathelicidins from the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana provides novel template for peptide antibiotic design.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e93216Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, Hc-CATH was dissolved in sterile deionized water to an ultimate concentration of 2 mg/ml and incubated at different temperatures (4, 20, 37, 50, 70, and 90 °C) for 1 h. After that, the MICs of the peptide solutions against E. coli ATCC25922 were determined. The thermal stability of Hc-CATH was examined according to the method described in our previous work (25Ling G. Gao J. Zhang S. Xie Z. Wei L. Yu H. Wang Y. Cathelicidins from the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana provides novel template for peptide antibiotic design.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e93216Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hc-CATH was dissolved in sterile deionized water to an ultimate concentration of 2 mg/ml. The peptide solution was incubated at 37 °C for 0–96 h. At each time point, the MICs of Hc-CATH against E. coli ATCC25922 were determined. The serum stability assay was carried out to evaluate the effect of serum on the antimicrobial activity of Hc-CATH. Briefly, Hc-CATH was dissolved in sterile deionized water to an ultimate concentration of 10 mg/ml. Human serum was mixed with Hc-CATH solution in a volume ratio of 4:1 to confirm that the volume percentage of human serum accounted for 80% of the mixture; the ultimate concentration of Hc-CATH was 2 mg/ml. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 0 −6 h, and at each time point, aliquots were taken and the MICs against E. coli ATCC25922 were determined. The cytotoxic activity of Hc-CATH was determined using the MTT (Sigma) method. Two mammalian tumor cell lines (human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and human prostate cancer cell line PC3), one normal mammalian cell line (mice fibroblast cell line L929), and mouse peritoneal macrophages were used for the assay, and the experiment was carried out as described in our previous work (25Ling G. Gao J. Zhang S. Xie Z. Wei L. Yu H. Wang Y. Cathelicidins from the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana provides novel template for peptide antibiotic design.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e93216Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After digestion with trypsin, the cells were diluted with serum-free DMEM to an ultimate concentration of ∼2 × 105 cells/ml. The cells was seeded in 96-well plates (100 μl/well) and cultured overnight until adhesion. Hc-CATH dissolved in serum-free DMEM was added to wells, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The subsequent procedure was performed according to the standard MTT method. Cell death induced by Hc-CATH was expressed as the percentage of the negative control group, which was regarded as 100%. To evaluate the cytotoxic activity of Hc-CATH toward human erythrocytes, hemolytic assay was performed according to the method described in our previous work (25Ling G. Gao J. Zhang S. Xie Z. Wei L. Yu H. Wang Y. Cathelicidins from the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana provides novel template for peptide antibiotic design.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e93216Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) was used to determine 100% hemolysis, and 0.9% saline was used as negative control. The hemolytic rates of Hc-CATH at different concentrations were recorded. To examine the cellular morphology alteration induced by Hc-CATH, an SEM experiment was performed as described previously (26Lu Z. Wang Y. Zhai L. Che Q. Wang H. Du S. Wang D. Feng F. Liu J. Lai R. Yu H. Novel cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptides from Equus asinus.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, S. aureus ATCC25923 and E. coli ATCC25922 were cultured in MH broth to exponential phase, washed with 0.15 m sodium chloride solution three times, and resuspended. Hc-CATH was added to the bacterial suspension to an ultimate concentration of 5× MIC and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min.

Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is highly expressed in the glial cells of the central nervous system and facilitates the osmotically driven pathological brain swelling associated with stroke and traumatic brain injury. Here we show that AQP4 cell surface expression can be rapidly and reversibly regulated in response to changes of tonicity in primary cortical rat astrocytes and in transfected HEK293 cells. The translocation mechanism involves PKA activation, influx of extracellular calcium, and activation of calmodulin. We identify five putative PKA phosphorylation sites and use site-directed mutagenesis to show that only phosphorylation at one of these sites, serine 276, is necessary for the translocation response. We discuss our findings in the context of the identification of new therapeutic approaches to treating brain edema."
https://openalex.org/W1829463977,"The toxicity of zearalenone (ZEA) was evaluated in swine spleen, a key organ for the innate and adaptative immune response. Weaned pigs were fed for 18 days with a control or a ZEA contaminated diet. The effect of ZEA was assessed on wide genome expression, pro- (TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10, IL-4) cytokines, other molecules involved in inflammatory processes (MMPs/TIMPs), as well as signaling molecules, (p38/JNK1/JNK2-MAPKs) and nuclear receptors (PPARγ/NFkB/AP-1/STAT3/c-JUN). Microarray analysis showed that 46% of total number of differentially expressed genes was involved in cellular signaling pathway, 13% in cytokine network and 10% in the inflammatory response. ZEA increased expression and synthesis of pro- inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β) and had no effect on IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines in spleen. The inflammatory stimulation might be a consequence of JNK pathway activation rather than of p-38MAPK and NF-kB involvement whose gene and protein expression were suppressed by ZEA action. In summary, our findings indicated the role of ZEA as an immune disruptor at spleen level."

These particles are known to cause respiratory toxicity and epithelial inflammation. They are eventually released to aquatic environment necessitating toxicity studies in cells from respiratory organs of aquatic organisms. Hence, we have developed and characterized a new cell line, WAG, from gill tissue of Wallago attu for toxicity assessment of TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles. The efficacy of the cell line as an in vitro system for nanoparticles toxicity studies was established using electron microscopy, cytotoxicity assays, genotoxicity assays and oxidative stress biomarkers. Results obtained with MTT assay, neutral red uptake assay and lactate dehydrogenase assay showed acute toxicity to WAG cells with IC50 values of 25.29 ± 0.12, 34.99 ± 0.09 and 35.06 ± 0.09 mg/l for TiO2 and 5.716 ± 0.1, 3.160 ± 0.1 and 5.57 ± 0.12 mg/l for ZnO treatment respectively. The physicochemical properties and size distribution of nanoparticles were characterized using electron microscopy with integrated energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Zetasizer. Dose dependent increase in DNA damage, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation along with a significant decrease in activity of Superoxide Dismutase, Catalase, total Glutathione levels and total antioxidant capacity with increasing concentration of exposed nanoparticles indicated that the cells were under oxidative stress. The study established WAG cell line as an in vitro system to study toxicity mechanisms of nanoparticles on aquatic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1487680918,"We sought to identify cells and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids that distinguish asthma from healthy control subjects and those that distinguish controlled asthma from uncontrolled asthma. Following informed consent, 36 human subjects were recruited for this study. These included 11 healthy control subjects, 15 subjects with controlled asthma with FEV1≥80% predicted and 10 subjects with uncontrolled asthma with FEV1 <80% predicted. BAL fluid was obtained from all subjects. The numbers of different cell types and the levels of 48 cytokines were measured in these fluids. Compared to healthy control subjects, patients with asthma had significantly more percentages of eosinophils and neutrophils, IL-1RA, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2Rα, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, G-CSF, GROα (CXCL1), MIP-1β (CCL4), MIG (CXCL9), RANTES (CCL5) and TRAIL in their BAL fluids. The only inflammatory markers that distinguished controlled asthma from uncontrolled asthma were neutrophil percentage and IL-8 levels, and both were inversely correlated with FEV1. We examined whether grouping asthma subjects on the basis of BAL eosinophil % or neutrophil % could identify specific cytokine profiles. The only differences between neutrophil-normal asthma (neutrophil≤2.4%) and neutrophil-high asthma (neutrophils%>2.4%) were a higher BAL fluid IL-8 levels, and a lower FEV1 in the latter group. By contrast, compared to eosinophil-normal asthma (eosinophils≤0.3%), eosinophil-high asthma (eosinophils>0.3%) had higher levels of IL-5, IL-13, IL-16, and PDGF-bb, but same neutrophil percentage, IL-8, and FEV1. Our results identify neutrophils and IL-8 are the only inflammatory components in BAL fluids that distinguish controlled asthma from uncontrolled asthma, and both correlate inversely with FEV1."
https://openalex.org/W406368810,"Medicinal plants are used as a popular alternative to synthetic drugs, both in developed and developing countries. The economic importance of the herbal and natural supplement industry is increasing every year. As the herbal industry grows, consumer safety is one issue that cannot be overlooked. Herbal products in Thai local markets are commonly sold without packaging or labels. Plant powders are stored in large bags or boxes, and therefore buying local herbal products poses a high risk of acquiring counterfeited, substituted and/or adulterated products. Due to these issues, a reliable method to authenticate products is needed. Here DNA barcoding was used in combination with High Resolution Melting analysis (Bar-HRM) to authenticate three medicinal Acanthaceae species (Acanthus ebracteatus, Andrographis paniculata and Rhinacanthus nasutus) commonly used in Thailand. The rbcL barcode was selected for use in primers design for HRM analysis to produce standard melting profiles of the selected species. Melting data from the HRM assay using the designed rbcL primers showed that the three chosen species could be distinguished from each other. HRM curves of all fifteen test samples indicated that three of tested products did not contain the indicated species. Two closely related species (A. paniculata and R. nasutus), which have a high level of morphological similarity, were interchanged with one another in three tested products. Incorrect information on packaging and labels of the tested herbal products was the cause of the results shown here. Morphological similarity among the species of interest also hindered the collection process. The Bar-HRM method developed here proved useful in aiding in the identification and authentication of herbal species in processed samples. In the future, species authentication through Bar-HRM could be used to promote consumer trust, as well as raising the quality of herbal products."
https://openalex.org/W1653978839,"Purpose To describe trends, patterns, and determinants of prescription drug use during pregnancy and postpartum. Methods This is a retrospective, population-based study of all women who gave birth between January 2002 and 31 December 2011 in British Columbia, Canada. Study population consisted of 225,973 women who had 322,219 pregnancies. We examined administrative datasets containing person-specific information on filled prescriptions, hospitalizations, and medical services. Main outcome measures were filled prescriptions during pregnancy and postpartum. We used logistic regressions to examine associations between prescription drug use and maternal characteristics. Results Approximately two thirds of women filled a prescription during pregnancy, increasing from 60% in 2002 to 66% in 2011. The proportion of pregnant women using medicines in all three trimesters of pregnancy increased from 20% in 2002 to 27% in 2011. Use of four or more different types of prescription drug during at least one trimester increased from 8.4% in 2002 to 11.7% in 2011. Higher BMI, smoking during pregnancy, age under 25, carrying multiples, and being diagnosed with a chronic condition all significantly increased the odds of prescription drug use during pregnancy. Conclusions The observed increase in the number of prescriptions and number of different drugs being dispensed suggests a trend in prescribing practices with potentially important implications for mothers, their neonates, and caregivers. Monitoring of prescribing practices and further research into the safety of most commonly prescribed medications is crucial in better understanding risks and benefits to the fetus and the mother."
https://openalex.org/W1508906948,"Coxsackieviruses A6 (CV-A6) and A16 (CV-A16) and Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) have caused periodic epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) among children in Singapore. We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the seroprevalence of these enteroviruses among Singapore children and adolescents. The study was conducted between August 2008 and July 2010. It involved 700 Singapore residents aged 1–17 years whose residual sera were obtained following the completion of routine biochemical investigations in two public acute-care hospitals. The levels of neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) against CV-A6, CV-A16 and EV-A71 were analyzed by the microneutralization test. The age-specific geometric mean titer (GMT) of antibodies against each of the three enteroviruses and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The seroprevalence of CV-A6 and CV-A16 was high at 62.7% (95% CI: 59.1–66.2%) and 60.6% (95% CI: 56.9–64.1%), respectively. However, the seroprevalence of EV-A71 was significantly lower at 29.3% (95% CI: 26.0–32.8%). About 89.7% of the children and adolescents had been infected by at least one of the three enteroviruses by 13–17 years of age. About half (52.3%) were seropositive for two or all three enteroviruses, while only 16.1% had no NtAb against any of the three enteroviruses. High NtAb levels were observed in the younger age groups. CV-A6 and CV-A16 infections are very common among Singapore children and adolescents, while EV-A71 infections are less common. Infection is continually acquired from early childhood to adolescent age."
https://openalex.org/W1486622215,"Background Evidence shows a high incidence of insulin resistance, inflammation and dyslipidemia in adult obesity. The aim of this study was to assess the relevance of inflammatory markers, circulating lipids, and insulin sensitivity in overweight/obese children. Methods We enrolled 45 male children (aged 6 to 13 years, lean control = 16, obese = 19, overweight = 10) in this study. The plasma total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose and insulin levels, the circulating levels of inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1, and the high-sensitive CRP level were determined using quantitative colorimetric sandwich ELISA kits. Results Compared with the lean control subjects, the obese subjects had obvious insulin resistance, abnormal lipid profiles, and low-grade inflammation. The overweight subjects only exhibited significant insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation. Both TNF-α and leptin levels were higher in the overweight/obese subjects. A concurrent correlation analysis showed that body mass index (BMI) percentile and fasting insulin were positively correlated with insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and inflammatory markers but negatively correlated with adiponectin. A factor analysis identified three domains that explained 74.08% of the total variance among the obese children (factor 1: lipid, 46.05%; factor 2: obesity-inflammation, 15.38%; factor 3: insulin sensitivity domains, 12.65%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that lipid, obesity-inflammation, and insulin sensitivity domains predominantly exist among obese children. These factors might be applied to predict the outcomes of cardiovascular diseases in the future."

https://openalex.org/W1914166031,"Body size and development time are important life history traits because they are often highly correlated with fitness. Although the developmental mechanisms that control growth have been well studied, the mechanisms that control how a species-characteristic body size is achieved remain poorly understood. In insects adult body size is determined by the number of larval molts, the size increment at each molt, and the mechanism that determines during which instar larval growth will stop. Adult insects do not grow, so the size at which a larva stops growing determines adult body size. Here we develop a quantitative understanding of the kinetics of growth throughout larval life of Manduca sexta, under different conditions of nutrition and temperature, and for genetic strains with different adult body sizes. We show that the generally accepted view that the size increment at each molt is constant (Dyar's Rule) is systematically violated: there is actually a progressive increase in the size increment from instar to instar that is independent of temperature. In addition, the mass-specific growth rate declines throughout the growth phase in a temperature-dependent manner. We show that growth within an instar follows a truncated Gompertz trajectory. The critical weight, which determines when in an instar a molt will occur, and the threshold size, which determines which instar is the last, are different in genetic strains with different adult body sizes. Under nutrient and temperature stress Manduca has a variable number of larval instars and we show that this is due to the fact that more molts at smaller increments are taken before threshold size is reached. We test whether the new insight into the kinetics of growth and size determination are sufficient to explain body size and development time through a mathematical model that incorporates our quantitative findings."
https://openalex.org/W1523848206,"Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), an uncommon co-morbidity in patients treated with bisphosphonates (BP), occurs in the segment of jawbone interfacing oral mucosa. This study aimed to investigate a role of oral mucosal barrier γδ T cells in the pathogenesis of ONJ. Female C57Bl/6J (B6) mice received a bolus zoledronate intravenous injection (ZOL, 540 μg/kg), and their maxillary left first molars were extracted 1 week later. ZOL-treated mice (WT ZOL) delayed oral wound healing with patent open wounds 4 weeks after tooth extraction with characteristic oral epithelial hyperplasia. γδ T cells appeared within the tooth extraction site and hyperplastic epithelium in WT ZOL mice. In ZOL-treated γδ T cell null (Tcrd−/− ZOL) mice, the tooth extraction open wound progressively closed; however, histological ONJ-like lesions were identified in 75 and 60% of WT ZOL and Tcrd−/− ZOL mice, respectively. Although the bone exposure phenotype of ONJ was predominantly observed in WT ZOL mice, Tcrd−/− ZOL mice developed the pustule/fistula disease phenotype. We further addressed the role of γδ T cells from human peripheral blood (h-γδ T cells). When co-cultured with ZOL-pretreated human osteoclasts in vitro, h-γδ T cells exhibited rapid expansion and robust IFN-γ secretion. When h-γδ T cells were injected into ZOL-treated immunodeficient (Rag2−/− ZOL) mice, the oral epithelial hyperplasia developed. However, Rag2−/− ZOL mice did not develop osteonecrosis. The results indicate that γδ T cells are unlikely to influence the core osteonecrosis mechanism; however, they may serve as a critical modifier contributing to the different oral mucosal disease variations of ONJ. Background: The pathological mechanism of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is unknown. Results: Mouse ONJ-like lesions exhibited epithelial hyperplasia associated with γδ T cells of mouse or human origin. Conclusion: γδ T cells may modify the oral disease phenotypes of ONJ. Significance: ONJ pathogenesis may involve multiple mechanisms separately leading to the development of osteonecrosis or oral epithelial abnormality."

Genetic studies focusing on common nuclear genome variants associated with these disorders have produced genome wide significant results but those studies have not directly studied mtDNA variants. The purpose of this study is to investigate, using next generation sequencing, the involvement of mtDNA variation in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and methamphetamine use. MtDNA extracted from multiple brain regions and blood were sequenced (121 mtDNA samples with an average of 8,800x coverage) and compared to an electronic database containing 26,850 mtDNA genomes. We confirmed novel and rare variants, and confirmed next generation sequencing error hotspots by traditional sequencing and genotyping methods. We observed a significant increase of non-synonymous mutations found in individuals with schizophrenia. Novel and rare non-synonymous mutations were found in psychiatric cases in mtDNA genes: ND6, ATP6, CYTB, and ND2. We also observed mtDNA heteroplasmy in brain at a locus previously associated with schizophrenia (T16519C). Large differences in heteroplasmy levels across brain regions within subjects suggest that somatic mutations accumulate differentially in brain regions. Finally, multiplasmy, a heteroplasmic measure of repeat length, was observed in brain from selective cases at a higher frequency than controls. These results offer support for increased rates of mtDNA substitutions in schizophrenia shown in our prior results. The variable levels of heteroplasmic/multiplasmic somatic mutations that occur in brain may be indicators of genetic instability in mtDNA."
https://openalex.org/W358290377,"The freshwater pearl mussel family Margaritiferidae includes 13 extant species, which are all listed by IUCN as endangered or vulnerable taxa. In this study, an extensive spatial sampling of Margaritifera spp. across the Russian Far East (Amur Basin, Kamchatka Peninsula, Kurile Archipelago and Sakhalin Island) was conducted for a revision of their taxonomy and distribution ranges. Based on their DNA sequences, shell and soft tissue morphology, three valid species were identified: Margaritifera dahurica (Middendorff, 1850), M. laevis (Haas, 1910) and M. middendorffi (Rosén, 1926). M. dahurica ranges across the Amur basin and some of the nearest river systems. M. laevis is distributed in Japan, Sakhalin Island and the Kurile Archipelago. M. middendorffi was previously considered an endemic species of the Kamchatka. However, it is widespread in the rivers of Kamchatka, Sakhalin Island, the Kurile Islands (across the Bussol Strait, which is the most significant biogeographical boundary within the archipelago), and, likely, in Japan. The Japanese species M. togakushiensis Kondo & Kobayashi, 2005 seems to be conspecific with M. middendorffi because of similar morphological patterns, small shell size (<100 mm long) and overlapped ranges, but it is in need of a separate revision. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that two NW Pacific margaritiferid species, M. laevis and M. middendorffi, formed a monophyletic 18S rDNA clade together with the North American species M. marrianae and M. falcata. The patterns that were found in these Margaritifera spp. are similar to those of freshwater fishes, indicating multiple colonizations of Eastern Asia by different mitochondrial lineages, including an ancient Beringian exchange between freshwater faunas across the Pacific."

All patients received limb-salvage surgery and reconstruction with modular hemipelvic endoprosthesis.Patients were followed for an average of 54 months. At the most recent follow-up, 32 patients were alive with an estimated three-year and five-year survival rate of 66.3% and 57.5% according to the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Eighteen patients died from the tumor, with a mean survival of 28 months, and 9 patients experienced local recurrence at an average of 19.6 months after surgery. Patients with marginal or intracapsular surgical margins had a significantly higher recurrence rate than those with wide margins (p=0.02). Metastasis occurred in 12 cases at an average of 16 months after surgery. The perioperative complication rate was 48.0%, and the most common complications were wound healing disturbance (28.0%) and deep infection (14.0%). The endoprosthetic complication rate was 16.0%, and breakage of the pubic connection plate was the most common complication. The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 61.4%.Reconstruction with a modular hemipelvic endoprosthesis after pelvic tumor resection can improve function, with an acceptable complication rate."
https://openalex.org/W1577542492,"The homeostatic maintenance of stem cells that carry out continuous organogenesis at the shoot meristem is crucial for plant development. Key known factors act to signal between the stem cells and an underlying group of cells thought to act as the stem cell niche. In Arabidopsis thaliana the homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) is essential for stem cell initiation and maintenance at shoot and flower meristems. Recent data suggest that the WUS protein may move from the niche cells directly into the stem cells to maintain stem cell identity. Here we provide evidence for a second, previously unknown, pathway for stem cell specification at shoot and flower meristems that bypasses the requirement for WUS. We demonstrate that this novel stem cell specification pathway is normally repressed by the activity of the HD-zip III transcription factors PHABULOSA (PHB), PHAVOLUTA (PHV) and CORONA (CNA). When de-repressed, this second stem cell pathway leads to an accumulation of stem cells and an enlargement of the stem cell niche. When de-repressed in a wus mutant background, this second stem cell pathway leads to functional meristems with largely normal cell layering and meristem morphology, activation of WUS cis regulatory elements, and extensive, but not indeterminate, organogenesis. Thus, WUS is largely dispensable for stem cell specification and meristem function, suggesting a set of key stem cell specification factors, competitively regulated by WUS and PHB/PHV/CNA, remain unidentified."

This syndrome is emerging as an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially among people of Asian descent. Trigger for the production of this autoantibody remains unknown, but genetic factors are strongly suspected to be involved. We compared HLA genotyping between 32 patients with this clinical syndrome, and 38 controls. We found that this clinical syndrome was associated with very limited allele polymorphism, with HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 alleles, especially HLA-DRB1*15:01, DRB1*16:02, DQB1*05:01 and DQB1*05:02.

https://openalex.org/W375881316,"According to the dual-process theory, coping flexibility is defined as the ability to produce and implement a new coping strategy in place of an ineffective coping strategy. Specifically, coping flexibility includes two processes: evaluation coping and adaptive coping. Evaluation coping refers to sensitivity to feedback about the efficacy of a coping strategy, and adaptive coping involves the willingness to implement alternative coping strategies. The coping flexibility hypothesis (CFH) postulates that more flexible coping will be associated with more adaptive outcomes; importantly, there are numerous theories and studies that support the CFH. The main purpose of this study was to test the CFH based on dual-process theory.A total of 1,770 Japanese college students participated and, completed a set of questionnaires that measured coping flexibility (evaluation coping and adaptive coping) and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were measured via the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.The proportions of women and men who reported depressive symptoms were 58.69% (95% CIs [55.74, 61.66]) and 54.17% (95% CIs [50.37, 57.95]), respectively when a cut-off score of 16 on the CES-D was used. A multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that evaluation coping (OR = 0.86, 95% CIs [0.83, 0.0.89]) and adaptive coping (OR = 0.91, 95% CIs [0.88, 0.93]) were significantly associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms.The results of the present study indicated that the CFH based on dual-process theory was supported in a Japanese sample."
https://openalex.org/W411732000,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of hormonal status and bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the glycosidases present and glycosylation changes as assessed by lectin binding to cervicovaginal lavage constituents. Frozen cervicovaginal lavage samples from a completed study examining the impact of reproductive hormones on the physicochemical properties of vaginal fluid were utilized for the present study. In the parent study, 165 women were characterized as having BV, intermediate or normal microflora using the Nugent criteria. The presence of glycosidases in the samples was determined using quantitative 4-methyl-umbelliferone based assays, and glycosylation was assessed using enzyme linked lectin assays (ELLA). Women with BV had elevated sialidase, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase and α-glucosidase activities compared to intermediate or normal women (P<0.001, 0.003, 0.006 and 0.042 respectively). The amount of sialic acid (Sambucus nigra, P = 0.003) and high mannose (griffithsin, P<0.001) were reduced, as evaluated by lectin binding, in women with BV. When the data were stratified according to hormonal status, α-glucosidase and griffithsin binding were decreased among postmenopausal women (P<0.02) when compared to premenopausal groups. These data suggest that both hormonal status and BV impact the glycosidases and lectin binding sites present in vaginal fluid. The sialidases present at increased levels in women with BV likely reduce the number of sialic acid binding sites. Other enzymes likely reduce griffithsin binding. The alterations in the glycosidase content, high mannose and sialic acid binding sites in the cervicovaginal fluid associated with bacterial vaginosis may impact susceptibility to viruses, such as HIV, that utilize glycans as a portal of entry."
https://openalex.org/W412918832,"Dysregulation of signaling pathways and energy metabolism in cancer cells enhances production of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide that supports tumorigenesis through multiple mechanisms. To counteract the adverse effects of mitochondrial peroxide many solid tumor types up-regulate the mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase 2 - thioredoxin 2 (TRX2) - peroxiredoxin 3 (PRX3) antioxidant network. Using malignant mesothelioma cells as a model, we show that thiostrepton (TS) irreversibly disables PRX3 via covalent crosslinking of peroxidatic and resolving cysteine residues in homodimers, and that targeting the oxidoreductase TRX2 with the triphenylmethane gentian violet (GV) potentiates adduction by increasing levels of disulfide-bonded PRX3 dimers. Due to the fact that activity of the PRX3 catalytic cycle dictates the rate of adduction by TS, immortalized and primary human mesothelial cells are significantly less sensitive to both compounds. Moreover, stable knockdown of PRX3 reduces mesothelioma cell proliferation and sensitivity to TS. Expression of catalase in shPRX3 mesothelioma cells restores defects in cell proliferation but not sensitivity to TS. In a SCID mouse xenograft model of human mesothelioma, administration of TS and GV together reduced tumor burden more effectively than either agent alone. Because increased production of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide is a common phenotype of malignant cells, and TS and GV are well tolerated in mammals, we propose that targeting PRX3 is a feasible redox-dependent strategy for managing mesothelioma and other intractable human malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1604923955,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family and plays important roles in a number of physiological and pathological processes. Expression of LRP1 requires the receptor-associated protein (RAP), a molecular chaperone that binds LRP1 and other low density lipoprotein receptor family members in the endoplasmic reticulum and traffics with them to the Golgi where the acidic environment causes its dissociation. Exogenously added RAP is a potent LRP1 antagonist and binds to LRP1 on the cell surface, preventing ligands from binding. Following endocytosis, RAP dissociates in the acidic endosome, allowing LRP1 to recycle back to the cell surface. The acid-induced dissociation of RAP is mediated by its D3 domain, a relatively unstable three-helical bundle that denatures at pH <6.2 due to protonation of key histidine residues on helices 2 and 3. To develop an LRP1 inhibitor that does not dissociate at low pH, we introduced a disulfide bond between the second and third helices in the RAP D3 domain. By combining this disulfide bond with elimination of key histidine residues, we generated a stable RAP molecule that is resistant to both pH- and heat-induced denaturation. This molecule bound to LRP1 with high affinity at both neutral and acidic pH and proved to be a potent inhibitor of LRP1 function both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that our stable RAP molecule may be useful in multiple pathological settings where LRP1 blockade has been shown to be effective."

The influence of the novel ventilator mode Chest Compression Synchronized Ventilation (CCSV) on gas exchange and arterial blood pressure compared with IPPV was investigated in a pig model.In 12 pigs (general anaesthesia/intubation) ventricular fibrillation was induced and continuous chest compressions were started after 3 min. Pigs were mechanically ventilated in a cross-over setting with 5 ventilation periods of 4 min each: Ventilation modes were during the first and last period IPPV (100% O2, tidal volumes = 7 ml/kgKG, respiratory rate = 10/min), during the 2nd, 3rd and 4th period CCSV (100% O2), a pressure-controlled and with each chest compression synchronized breathing pattern with three different presets in randomized order. Presets: CCSVA: P insp = 60 mbar, inspiratory time = 205 ms; CCSVB: P insp = 60 mbar, inspiratory time = 265 ms; CCSVC: P insp = 45 mbar, inspiratory time = 265 ms. Blood gas samples were drawn for each period, mean arterial (MAP) and central venous (CVP) blood pressures were continuously recorded. Results as median (25%/75%percentiles).Ventilation with each CCSV mode resulted in higher PaO2 than IPPV: PaO2: IPPV first: 19.6(13.9/36.2)kPa, IPPV last: 22.7(5.4/36.9)kPa (p = 0.77 vs IPPV first), CCSVA: 48.9(29.0/58.2)kPa (p = 0.028 vs IPPV first, p = 0.0001 vs IPPV last), CCSVB: 54.0 (43.8/64.1) (p = 0.001 vs IPPV first, p = 0.0001 vs IPPV last), CCSVC: 46.0 (20.2/58.4) (p = 0.006 vs IPPV first, p = 0.0001 vs IPPV last). Both the MAP and the difference MAP-CVP did not decrease during twelve minutes CPR with all three presets of CCSV and were higher than the pressures of the last IPPV period.All patterns of CCSV lead to a higher PaO2 and avoid an arterial blood pressure drop during resuscitation compared to IPPV in this pig model of cardiac arrest."
https://openalex.org/W366275365,"Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) regulate cellular calcium influx, one of the earliest responses to mechanical stimulation in osteoblasts. Here, we postulate that T-type VSCCs play an essential role in bone mechanical response to load and participate in events leading to the pathology of load-induced OA. Repetitive mechanical insult was used to induce OA in Cav3.2 T-VSCC null and wild-type control mouse knees. Osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) and chondrocytes were treated with a selective T-VSCC inhibitor and subjected to fluid shear stress to determine how blocking of T-VSCCs alters the expression profile of each cell type upon mechanical stimulation. Conditioned-media (CM) obtained from static and sheared MC3T3-E1 was used to assess the effect of osteoblast-derived factors on the chondrocyte phenotype. T-VSCC null knees exhibited significantly lower focal articular cartilage damage than age-matched controls. In vitro inhibition of T-VSCC significantly reduced the expression of both early and late mechanoresponsive genes in osteoblasts but had no effect on gene expression in chondrocytes. Furthermore, treatment of chondrocytes with CM obtained from sheared osteoblasts induced expression of markers of hypertrophy in chondrocytes and this was nearly abolished when osteoblasts were pre-treated with the T-VSCC-specific inhibitor. These results indicate that T-VSCC plays a role in signaling events associated with induction of OA and is essential to the release of osteoblast-derived factors that promote an early OA phenotype in chondrocytes. Further, these findings suggest that local inhibition of T-VSCC may serve as a therapy for blocking load-induced bone formation that results in cartilage degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W431326737,"Human awareness is highly limited, which is vividly demonstrated by the phenomenon that unexpected objects go unnoticed when attention is focused elsewhere (inattentional blindness). Typically, some people fail to notice unexpected objects while others detect them instantaneously. Whether this pattern reflects stable individual differences is unclear to date. In particular, hardly anything is known about the influence of personality on the likelihood of inattentional blindness. To fill this empirical gap, we examined the role of multiple personality factors, namely the Big Five, BIS/BAS, absorption, achievement motivation, and schizotypy, in these failures of awareness. In a large-scale sample (N = 554), susceptibility to inattentional blindness was associated with a low level of openness to experience and marginally with a low level of achievement motivation. However, in a multiple regression analysis, only openness emerged as an independent, negative predictor. This suggests that the general tendency to be open to experience extends to the domain of perception. Our results complement earlier work on the possible link between inattentional blindness and personality by demonstrating, for the first time, that failures to consciously perceive unexpected objects reflect individual differences on a fundamental dimension of personality."

Loss-of-function mutations in CTRC increase the risk for chronic pancreatitis. Here we describe functional analysis of eight previously uncharacterized natural CTRC variants tested for potential defects in secretion, proteolytic stability, and catalytic activity. We found that all variants were secreted from transfected cells normally, and none suffered proteolytic degradation by trypsin. Five variants had normal enzymatic activity, whereas variant p.R29Q was catalytically inactive due to loss of activation by trypsin and variant p.S239C exhibited impaired activity possibly caused by disulfide mispairing.

In the intestinal milieu, cleavage of the calcium binding loop is blocked by high calcium concentrations and trypsinogen degradation is minimal. However, in the presence of submillimolar calcium concentrations prevailing in pancreatic secretions, the dominant effect of CTRC is trypsinogen degradation, which is responsible for protecting the pancreas against premature, intra-pancreatic activation of trypsinogen.

These zymogens possess 94–96-amino acid-long propeptides, which act as tethered, tight-binding inhibitors of the active enzymes. Trypsin initiates procarboxypeptidase activation by cleaving the propeptide at its C terminus.

Several studies attempted to clarify the determinants of this specificity. Phage display-selected variants of the locust-derived chymotrypsin inhibitor Schistocerca gregaria proteinase inhibitor-2 (SGPI-2) indicated that negatively charged amino acids on the primed side of the scissile peptide bond are important for CTRC recognition (16Szabó A.

In our recent comprehensive study, we analyzed 32 natural CTRC variants and identified three different but mutually non-exclusive loss-of-function mechanisms associated with pancreatitis: diminished secretion, loss of catalytic activity, and degradation by trypsin (18Beer S. Zhou J. Szabó A. Keiles S. Chandak G.R. Witt H. Sahin-Tóth M. Comprehensive functional analysis of chymotrypsin C (CTRC) variants reveals distinct loss-of-function mechanisms associated with pancreatitis risk.Gut. 2013; 62: 1616-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). CTRC variants with reduced secretion also elicited endoplasmic reticulum stress in pancreatic acinar cells, but the significance of this mechanism remains indeterminate (18Beer S. Zhou J. Szabó A. Keiles S. Chandak G.R. Witt H. Sahin-Tóth M.

In the present study, we extended these findings by functionally analyzing eight previously uncharacterized CTRC variants, including two novel variants reported here for the first time. Surprisingly, one of these variants, p.G214R, turned out to be the functional paralog of human mesotrypsin, a fascinating trypsin isoform with unique inhibitor resistance and inhibitor-degrading properties. Nucleotide numbering of the coding DNA for CTRC starts with the first nucleotide of the ATG translation initiation codon. Amino acid residues in human CTRC are numbered starting with the initiator methionine of the primary translation product (chymotrypsinogen C precursor or pre-chymotrypsinogen C). By convention, eglin C and ecotin amino acid residues are numbered according to the sequence of the native, secreted protein (20Knecht R. Seemüller U. Liersch M. Fritz H. Braun D.G. Chang J.Y.

A heterozygous CTRC variant c.239G>A(p.R80Q) was found in a human pancreatic cDNA sample from a de-identified subject of unknown origin and clinical status. Heterozygous variant c.640G>A (p.G214R) was identified in exon 7 of the CTRC gene in an 18-year-old male referred for genetic testing because of recurrent acute pancreatitis in Slovakia. No other variants were detected in exons 2 and 3 of CTRC or in the PRSS1 and SPINK1 genes commonly associated with chronic pancreatitis. The pcDNA3.1(−) expression plasmids harboring the coding DNA for human CTRC with or without a His10 affinity tag were constructed previously (6Szmola R. Sahin-Tóth M.

CTRC mutants were generated by overlap extension PCR and ligated into the pcDNA3.1(−) vector using XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites. The His-tagged versions of the constructs were used for purifications. HEK 293T cells were cultured at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/well in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C, in 6-well tissue culture plates. Transfections were carried out using 2 μg of expression plasmid with 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 2 ml of DMEM. After overnight incubation, cells were rinsed and covered with 2 ml of Opti-MEM. The conditioned Opti-MEM medium was harvested after 24 or 48 h, as indicated. Aliquots (200 μl) of the conditioned medium were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration), and the proteins were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Densitometric quantitation of bands was carried out with the Gel Doc XR+ gel documentation system and Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of conditioned medium (37.5 μl) were incubated with 100 nm human cationic trypsin at 37 °C for 1 h in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm CaCl2 in 50-μl final volume. CTRC activity was then measured by adding 150 μl of 200 μm Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide substrate at 22 °C. Release of the yellow p-nitroaniline was followed at 405 nm for 1 min in a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices), and the rate of substrate cleavage was determined from the linear portion of the curves. His-tagged forms of CTRC variants were purified from 200 ml of conditioned media using nickel affinity chromatography, as described previously (7Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M.

Chem. 2012; 287: 20701-20710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Purified CTRC zymogen was activated with 50 μl of immobilized trypsin (20230, Thermo Scientific) in 3-ml final volume of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 2 h at 22 °C. Concentration of active CTRC was determined using active site titration with ecotin, as described recently (16Szabó A. Héja D. Szakács D. Zboray K. Kékesi K.A. Radisky E.S. Sahin-Tóth M. Pál G.

Chem. 2011; 286: 22535-22545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The concentration of variants p.R29Q, p.G214R, p.S239C, and mutant p.G214M was estimated by comparing their protein band intensity with that of wild-type CTRC on Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Measurements were performed in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20 at 22 °C. CTRC concentration in the assay was 10 nm, with the exception of variant p.S239C, which was assayed at 40 nm. The concentration of the Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide substrate was varied between 5 and 180 μm. To determine Km and kcat, substrate cleavage rates were plotted as a function of substrate concentration and the data points were fitted with the Michaelis-Menten hyperbolic equation. To determine the apparent inhibitory constant (Ki) of chymotrypsin inhibitors against variant p.G214R and mutant p.G214M, kinetic measurements were performed with 5 nm enzyme in the presence of increasing inhibitor concentrations (0–2 μm). The concentration of the Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide substrate was varied between 5 and 640 μm. Apparent Km values were plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration, and apparent Ki was derived from the negative intercept (−Ki) of the linear fit on the horizontal axis. The assay mixture contained 10 μl of CPA1 sample and 70 μl of assay buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20), and the reaction was started by adding 20 μl of 600 μm N-[4-methoxyphenylazoformyl]-l-phenylalanine substrate (22Mock W.L. Liu Y. Stanford D.J. Arazoformyl peptide surrogates as spectrophotometric kinetic assay substrates for carboxypeptidase A.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The decrease in absorbance was followed at 350 nm for 2 min at 22 °C. Rates of substrate cleavage were calculated from fits to the initial linear portion of the curves and were expressed in milliOD·min−1 units (where OD indicates optical density). Ecotin was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified on a trypsin affinity column (23Lengyel Z. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. Affinity purification of recombinant trypsinogen using immobilized ecotin.Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for eglin C and SGPI-2-C4 were kind gifts from Evette Radisky (Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Jacksonville Florida) and Gábor Pál (Eotvos University, Budapest, Hungary), respectively. SGPI-2-C4 is a phage display-selected CTRC-specific variant of the locust-derived chymotrypsin inhibitor SGPI-2 (16Szabó A. Héja D. Szakács D. Zboray K. Kékesi K.A. Radisky E.S. Sahin-Tóth M. Pál G.

Inhibitor concentrations were determined by titration against active-site titrated bovine trypsin (ecotin) or wild-type human CTRC (eglin C and SGPI-2-C4). Tight-binding inhibition of wild-type CTRC by eglin C, ecotin, and SGPI-2-C4 was assessed by measuring the apparent dissociation constant (KD) values in equilibrium, as reported previously (16Szabó A."
https://openalex.org/W387401185,"Thionins are plant-specific antimicrobial peptides that have been isolated from the endosperm and leaves of cereals, from the leaves of mistletoes, and from several other plant species. They are generally basic peptides with three or four disulfide bridges and a molecular mass of ∼5 kDa. Thionins are produced as preproproteins consisting of a signal peptide, the thionin domain, and an acidic domain. Previously, only mature thionin peptides have been isolated from plants, and in addition to removal of the signal peptide, at least one cleavage processing step between the thionin and the acidic domain is necessary to release the mature thionin. In this work, we identified a thionin proprotein-processing enzyme (TPPE) from barley. Purification of the enzyme was guided by an assay that used a quenched fluorogenic peptide comprising the amino acid sequence between the thionin and the acidic domain of barley leaf-specific thionin. The barley TPPE was identified as a serine protease (BAJ93208) and expressed in Escherichia coli as a strep tag-labeled protein. The barley BTH6 thionin proprotein was produced in E. coli using the vector pETtrx1a and used as a substrate. We isolated and sequenced the BTH6 thionin from barley to confirm the N and C terminus of the peptide in planta. Using an in vitro enzymatic assay, the recombinant TPPE was able to process the quenched fluorogenic peptide and to cleave the acidic domain at least at six sites releasing the mature thionin from the proprotein. Moreover, it was found that the intrinsic three-dimensional structure of the BTH6 thionin domain prevents cleavage of the mature BTH6 thionin by the TPPE.

Plants are continuously exposed to a large number of pests and pathogens and therefore have evolved different defense mechanisms to enhance their survival. Among those are a large variety of antimicrobial peptides, whose production can be constitutive or inducible. To date, many antimicrobial peptides have been isolated from different plant species and have been shown to possess antimicrobial activity in vitro (1Benko-Iseppon A.M. Galdino S.L. Calsa Jr., T. Kido E.A. Tossi A. Belarmino L.C. Crovella S. Overview on plant antimicrobial peptides.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2010; 11: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2Padovan L. Scocchi M. Tossi A. Structural aspects of plant antimicrobial peptides.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2010; 11: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The first antimicrobial peptide isolated and characterized was purothionin from the endosperm of wheat (3Balls A.K. Hale W.S. Harris T.H. A crystalline protein obtained from a lipoprotein of wheat flour.Cereal Chem. 1942; 19: 279-288Google Scholar). Purothionin is actually a mixture of closely related isoforms (4Fisher N. Redman D.G. Elton G.A. Fractionation and characterization of purothionin.Cereal Chem. 1968; 45: 48-57Google Scholar), and similar peptides have subsequently been isolated from other cereals, mistletoes, and several other plant species (5Bohlman H. Apel K. Thionins.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 227-240Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 6Bohlmann H. The role of thionins in plant-protection.Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1994; 13: 1-16Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Barley contains in addition to the endosperm-specific hordothionins a large group of so-called leaf thionins (7Bohlmann H. Clausen S. Behnke S. Giese H. Hiller C. Reimann-Philipp U. Schrader G. Barkholt V. Apel K. Leaf-specific thionins of barley–a novel class of cell wall proteins toxic to plant-pathogenic fungi and possibly involved in the defence mechanism of plants.EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1559-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thionins contain on average 45 amino acids, are usually basic, and contain 6 or 8 cysteine residues that have been shown to form disulfide bridges. A variety of toxic and antimicrobial activities of different thionins have been found in vitro (6Bohlmann H. The role of thionins in plant-protection.Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1994; 13: 1-16Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the overexpression of thionins in plants resulted in enhanced resistance against pathogens (8Epple P. Apel K. Bohlmann H. Overexpression of an endogenous thionin enhances resistance of Arabidopsis against Fusarium oxysporum.Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The first thionins were discovered by amino acid sequencing of the isolated peptides (5Bohlman H. Apel K. Thionins.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 227-240Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the meantime, DNA sequencing of thionin cDNAs and genes showed that thionins are produced as preproproteins (9Ponz F. Paz-Ares J. Hernández-Lucas C. Carbonero P. García-Olmedo F. Synthesis and processing of thionin precursors in developing endosperm from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing an N-terminal signal peptide for secretion and a C-terminal propart, which is usually acidic and has therefore been named acidic domain. A peptide corresponding to the acidic domain has never been isolated from plants. To date, no experimental information is available about possible functions of the acidic domain, but it is clearly not dispensable as shown by the high conservation of the cysteine residues. Even viscotoxin precursors, which have several deletions in the acidic domain, have the same conserved pattern of 6 cysteine residues (10Schrader G. Apel K. Isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding viscotoxins of mistletoe (Viscum album).Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Possible functions of the acidic domain could be to target the mature thionin via the secretory pathway to its final destination (vacuoles, cell walls, and protein bodies), to neutralize the toxic basic thionins and thereby protect the cell against its own toxin, and as an intramolecular chaperone to assist in the folding of the thionin. The proprotein for a plant defensin is needed for protection of the plant against its own peptide and for subcellular targeting to the vacuole (11Lay F.T. Poon S. McKenna J.A. Connelly A.A. Barbeta B.L. McGinness B.S. Fox J.L. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Heath R.L. Anderson M.A. The C-terminal propeptide of a plant defensin confers cytoprotective and subcellular targeting functions.BMC Plant Biol. 2014; 14: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Subtilases represent a group of serine proteases with over 200 known proteins (12Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Subtilases: the superfamily of subtilisin-like serine proteases.Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Members of the subtilase superfamily have the same catalytic triad (Asp, His, and Ser) as subtilisin Carlsberg and subtilisin BPN, two closely related serine proteases isolated from two strains of Bacillus subtilis in 1966 by Smith et al. (13Smith E.L. Markland F.S. Kasper C.B. DeLange R.J. Landon M. Evans W.H. The complete amino acid sequence of two types of subtilisin, BPN and Carlsberg.J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5974-5976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subtilases can be classified into six families according to their catalytic domain structures, namely subtilisins, thermitases, proteinases K, lantibiotic peptidases, kexins, and pyrolysins (12Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Subtilases: the superfamily of subtilisin-like serine proteases.Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). An alternative classification is available via the protease database MEROPS (14Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Barrett A.J. MEROPS: the peptidase database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D270-D272Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In accordance with MEROPS, the subtilase family S8 is divided into the prokaryotic subgroup S8A and the eukaryotic subgroup S8B. All families mentioned above, except the kexin family, are represented in subgroup S8A, although the latter is found in S8B. Subtilases are more abundant in plants than in mammals with 63 members present in rice and 56 in Arabidopsis (15Rautengarten C. Steinhauser D. Büssis D. Stintzi A. Schaller A. Kopka J. Altmann T.

Cross genome comparisons of serine proteases in Arabidopsis and rice.BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 200Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All subtilases found in these two species belong to the pyrolysin subfamily. Some plant-derived enzymes have been studied in detail and are responsible for highly specific catalytic reactions in addition to nonselective general protein turnover. Different Arabidopsis subtilases are involved in the processing of protein precursors, which indicated that the thionin proprotein-processing enzyme (TPPE) 2The abbreviations used are: TPPEthionin proprotein-processing enzymeTEVtobacco etch virusTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinePA domainprotease-associated domainMCAmethoxycoumarinyl-4-acetylANA5-amino-2-nitrobenzoic acid. might also be a subtilase. Previously, Romero et al. (17Romero A. Alamillo J.M. García-Olmedo F. Processing of thionin precursors in barley leaves by a vacuolar proteinase.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) purified a protease from barley leaves that was able to process a thionin precursor protein in vitro. However, the authors claimed that they were only able to obtain a partial sequence (which was not published) of the protein, and no further studies have been reported since then. Here, we directly purified the TPPE from etiolated barley seedlings because these can be produced easily and contain large amounts of leaf-specific thionins (18Reimann-Philipp U. Behnke S. Batschauer A. Schäfer E. Apel K. The effect of light on the biosynthesis of leaf-specific thionins in barley, Hordeum vulgare.Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because of massive expressed sequence tag and genomic sequencing efforts in the last years, it was likely that a partial sequence of the TPPE enzyme would lead to identification of the corresponding gene or cDNA sequence. We used a fluorescently labeled peptide that incorporated the flanking sequence between barley leaf-specific thionins and their acidic domains to identify the TPPE protein, and we were able to identify several peptides by mass spectrometry that corresponded to a barley proteinase for which a complete cDNA sequence was available. The barley TPPE was produced as a strep tagged protein in E. coli and used to study the processing of a recombinant leaf-thionin precursor in vitro. thionin proprotein-processing enzyme tobacco etch virus N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine protease-associated domain methoxycoumarinyl-4-acetyl 5-amino-2-nitrobenzoic acid. Seeds of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare) variety Xanadu were soaked in water for 4 h at room temperature, transferred to vermiculite, and incubated at room temperature in light-tight plastic boxes. Etiolated seedlings were harvested after 5 days, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further usage. A fluorogenic substrate assay was used to measure TPPE activity. In a standard reaction, 10 μl of protease-containing sample was added to a solution containing a final concentration of 2 μm fluorogenic peptide (5-amino-2-nitrobenzoyl-SDYPKLNLLPK-7-methoxycoumarinyl-4-acetyl), 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2. Kinetic assays were performed at 25 °C, and formation of methoxycoumarinyl-4-acetyl (MCA)-labeled cleavage product was followed at 330 nm excitation and 420 nm emission using black 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner) in a FLUOstar Omega spectrophotometer (BMG Labtech). All chromatographic purifications used to purify the native TPPE from barley were performed on an ÄKTA Purifier 10 System (GE Healthcare). The purification was done as described by Romero et al. (17Romero A. Alamillo J.M. García-Olmedo F. Processing of thionin precursors in barley leaves by a vacuolar proteinase.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Five-day-old etiolated barley seedlings (500 g) were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. Proteins were extracted in 1 liter of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The extract was lyophilized, dissolved in 80 ml of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane. The filtrate was applied to a self-packed, 80-cm Sephacryl S-200 HR gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. A flow rate of 2 ml/min was used, and 5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were analyzed for protease activity, and active fractions were pooled, centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane. The solution was loaded onto a Highprep SP FF 16/10 cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) with a flow rate of 5 ml/min. A NaCl gradient (0 to 1 m) for 50 min was used to elute bound proteins. Protease activity was measured and found in the unbound fraction. This fraction was concentrated 10 times and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, using an ultrafiltration cell with a 3-kDa cutoff membrane and applied onto a Mono Q HR 16/10 anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) with a constant flow rate of 5 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with binding buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8). Bound compounds were eluted using a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl for 50 min. 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for protease activity. Active fractions were concentrated five times, and 15-μl samples were separated on SDS-PAGE. RNA was isolated from etiolated barley leaves using the Qiagen RNA plant mini kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer.

Open table in a new tab To follow the destiny of the mature thionin and the acidic domain after cleavage, the BTH6 proprotein was produced with an N-terminal Myc tag and a C-terminal strep tag in E. coli. To overcome solubility problems during the expression in E. coli, the proprotein was expressed as a fusion protein with thioredoxin, which is known to enhance disulfide bond formation and solubility of its fusion partner during expression in the cytoplasm. After expression and purification, the fusion protein was cleaved from the proprotein by TEVSH protease (19van den Berg S. Löfdahl P.A. Härd T. Berglund H. Improved solubility of TEV protease by directed evolution.J. Biotechnol. 2006; 121: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), which recognized a sequence between fusion protein and the double-tagged BTH6 proprotein. The expression vector pETtrx_1a (20Bogomolovas J. Simon B. Sattler M. Stier G. Screening of fusion partners for high yield expression and purification of bioactive viscotoxins.Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 64: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was modified to introduce a sequence coding for a Myc tag. Vector-specific primers PetTRXfor2 and TRXmycDraIBamHIrev2 were used in a PCR to amplify a part of the pETtrx_1a vector and to introduce a coding sequence for a Myc tag together with a multiple cloning site containing the restriction sites for DraI and BamHI. The amplicon was subsequently digested with XbaI and BamHI and ligated into the original pETtrx_1a vector digested with the same enzymes to produce pETtrxMyc_1a for expression of the BTH6 proprotein. The BTH6 cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) primers using total RNA extracted from etiolated barley seedlings. Gene-specific primers BTH6DraIfor and BTH6strepRevBam were used to amplify the sequence coding for the proprotein from the cDNA by PCR and to introduce the restriction sites DraI and BamHI together with a sequence coding for a strep tag at the 3′ end. The amplicon was purified and digested with the restriction enzymes DraI and BamHI and cloned into pETtrxMyc_1a to produce pETtrxMycBTH6strep. The plasmid pETtrxMycBTH6strep was transformed into the E. coli expression strain SHuffle C3030 (21Lobstein J. Emrich C.A. Jeans C. Faulkner M. Riggs P. Berkmen M.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated, and target protein was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid 1-ml HisTrap FF column on an Äkta purifier 10 system. Bound proteins were eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 500 mm using a 15-min gradient. 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. His6-TRX-BTH6-strep fusion protein containing fractions were incubated with TEVSH to release the N-terminal His6-TRX part of the fusion protein (19van den Berg S. Löfdahl P.A. Härd T. Berglund H. Improved solubility of TEV protease by directed evolution.J. Biotechnol. 2006; 121: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The reaction was set up in TEVSH reaction buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C for 24 h with a substrate:TEVSH ratio of 20:1. Myc-BTH6-strep was purified by loading the digestion mix on a 1-ml strep-tactin-Sepharose gravity flow column (IBA). The column was previously equilibrated with 5 column volumes of wash buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8). The unbound proteins were washed from the column by applying 5 column volumes of wash buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the column with 4 ml of elution buffer (2.5 mm desthiobiotin, 100 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and double-tagged thionin proprotein containing fractions were loaded on a μRPC C2/C18 reverse phase column. Equilibration and washing were performed with 0.1% TFA at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Bound peptides were eluted from the column with 0.1% TFA in 80% acetonitrile using a 30-min gradient. Elution of peptides was monitored by the detection of absorbance at 215, 254, and 280 nm. 0.25-ml fractions were collected, and proprotein-containing fractions were dialyzed against 25 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5, using Amicon Ultra 10K filtration centrifugal filters (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The purified myc-BTH6-strep proprotein was confirmed by LC-ESI-MS. Etiolated barley seedlings were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder. Protein extraction was performed with 10% acetic acid, and the solution was desalted with a gravity flow Bakerbond SPE octyl solid phase extraction column (Mallinckrodt Baker). Elution of bound compounds was performed with 70% acetonitrile. The eluate was dried in a centrifugal evaporator and resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5. A Mono S HR 16/10 column (GE Healthcare) was used to capture the thionin fraction. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–100%). Thionin-enriched fractions were identified by MALDI-TOF and applied to the reverse phase chromatography column Source C15 RPC ST 4.6/100 (GE Healthcare). Thionin-containing fractions were determined by MALDI-TOF, dried in a centrifugal evaporator, resuspended in 0.1% TFA, and applied to a μRPC C2/C18 column (GE Healthcare). Bound peptides were eluted from the column with 0.1% TFA in 80% acetonitrile using a 40-min gradient. BTH6 containing fractions were identified by LC-ESI-MS. The purified peptide was carboxymethyated with iodoacetamide and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated and analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Proteins larger than 30 kDa were resolved on T12.5/C1 SDS-polyacrylamide gels (22Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) using a Mini-PROTEAN® tetra cell system with accessories from Bio-Rad. Proteins smaller than 30 kDa were resolved on Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (16% separating gel and 4% stacking gel) (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa.Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Gels were stained in Coomassie solution (Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 10% acetic acid, 40% methanol) for 1 h at room temperature with constant shaking. Destaining was performed three times in 10% acetic acid for 1 h each time, and results were documented with a digital camera. Recombinant thionin proproteins were dried in a centrifugal evaporator (MI-VAC Quattro Concentrator, GeneVac) and reconstituted in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Reduction of cystines was performed by adding 10 μl of 1 m DTT (final concentration 10 mm) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. The samples were cooled to room temperature, and 25 μl of 1 m iodoacetic acid (prepared in 1 n NaOH) was added. The solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. 20 μl of 1 m DTT was added to quench the iodoacetic acid. The reduced and cysteine-carboxymethylated protein samples were dialyzed against TPPE digestion buffer (25 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5) using Amicon Ultra 10K ultrafiltration centrifugal filters (Millipore) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Peptides were dried in a centrifugal evaporator (MI-VAC Quattro Concentrator, GeneVac) for 20 min, reconstituted in water, and applied to HPLC in combination with an electrospray tandem mass spectrometer (LC-ESI-MS/MS, Dionex Ultimate 3000, Bruker maXis 4G ETD). Separation of trypsin-digested peptides was performed using a reverse phase C18 column (Thermo BioBasic C18, 150 × 0.32 mm, 5 μm packing) with peptide elution achieved by using a gradient of 55 min from 5% acetonitrile (solvent A, 0.1% formic acid) to 80% acetonitrile. Separation of undigested thionins was performed on a reverse phase C5 column (Supelco Discovery Bio Wide Pore C5 column, 50 × 0.32 mm, 3 μm packing) with a gradient of 35 min from 15% acetonitrile (solvent A, 0.1% formic acid) to 80% acetonitrile used to elute peptides. Data generated by mass spectrometry was processed using Data Analysis 4 (Bruker Daltonics) and MASCOT (24Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Probability-based protein identification by searching sequence databases using mass spectrometry data.Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar). Deconvolution was performed using MaxEnt software (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Thionin-containing fractions were determined by MALDI-TOF-MS. Samples were desalted and concentrated with Bond Elut OMIX C4 tips (Agilent) according to manufacturer's recommendations and eluted from the tips with elution buffer (50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA). 1 μl of desalted peptide samples were spotted on the target plate (MTP 384 target ground steel TF, Bruker Daltonics). The probes were dried under vacuum, and 1 μl of matrix (45% (v/v) acetonitrile, 1% (v/v) α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was applied to the dried peptides. Peptides were ionized by a 355 nm Smartbeam II laser at a frequency of 1 kHz, and time of flight (TOF) was measured in linear modus. Data were processed using FlexAnalysis (Bruker Daltonics). In earlier work we and others have obtained genomic and cDNA sequences for several leaf thionin precursors. Comparison with other thionins, e.g. the endosperm hordothionins, which have been purified from plants and sequenced, indicated that the 3′ end of leaf thionins would most likely be -CPSDYPK. (Fig. 1). To unambiguously identify the C terminus of the leaf thionin BTH6, the native peptide was purified from etiolated barley leaves using ion exchange chromatography and two reverse phase chromatographic purification steps. BTH6-containing fractions were identified using MALDI and ESI MS/MS mass spectrometry. To obtain amino acid sequences, the purified peptide was carboxymethylated with iodoacetamide and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated and analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The masses and corresponding sequences that were found are shown in Table 2. The peptides shown in Table 2 were fractionated, and amino acid sequences were obtained. These results confirmed that the purified leaf thonin BTH6 has a native C terminus ending with lysine as predicted by sequence alignments.TABLE 2Identification of BTH6m/zSequence984.86 [M + 5H]5+KSCCKDTLARNCYNTCRFAGGSRPVCAGACRCKIISGPKCPSDYPK575.31 [M + H]1+DTLAR614.38 [M + H]+IISGPK866.37 [M + 2H]+CPSDYPK494.18 [M + 2H]2+NCYNTCR733.34 [M + 2H]2+FAGGSRPVCAGACR Open table in a new tab The protease database MEROPS collects information about known proteases of all kingdoms, including possible cleavage sites. A search of the database (Release 9.8.) with the putative cleavage sites for thionin proproteins did not reveal any hit (results not shown). The authors of an earlier report used a barley leaf thionin proprotein labeled with 35S to detect the activity of TPPE with the help of autoradiography (17Romero A. Alamillo J.M. García-Olmedo F. Processing of thionin precursors in barley leaves by a vacuolar proteinase.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because this is a laborious procedure, we used a fluorogenic peptide covering the sequence between thionin and the acidic domain in the BTH6 proprotein to identify the TPPE protease. As starting material, etiolated barley seedlings were used. It has previously been shown that leaf thionins are strongly expressed in etiolated seedlings (18Reimann-Philipp U. Behnke S. Batschauer A.

The initial steps followed the original procedure and consisted of gel filtration, cation exchange, and anion exchange chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions from the anion exchange column with high protease activity (F8, F14, F24, and F32) were concentrated and separated on SDS-PAGE. Bands in the 66-kDa range were cut out from the gel (Fig. 2) followed by reduction, carboxymethylation, and tryptic in-gel digestion. Extracted peptides were analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS.

https://openalex.org/W392660315,"Cementum Protein 1 (CEMP1) is a key regulator of cementogenesis. CEMP1 promotes cell attachment, differentiation, deposition rate, composition, and morphology of hydroxyapatite crystals formed by human cementoblastic cells. Its expression is restricted to cementoblasts and progenitor cell subpopulations present in the periodontal ligament. CEMP1 transfection into non-osteogenic cells such as adult human gingival fibroblasts results in differentiation of these cells into a ""mineralizing"" cell phenotype. Other studies have shown evidence that CEMP1 could have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of bone defects and regeneration of other mineralized tissues. To better understand CEMP1's biological effects in vitro we investigated the consequences of its expression in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) growing in non-mineralizing media by comparing gene expression profiles. We identified several mRNAs whose expression is modified by CEMP1 induction in HGF cells. Enrichment analysis showed that several of these newly expressed genes are involved in oncogenesis. Our results suggest that CEMP1 causes the transformation of HGF and NIH3T3 cells. CEMP1 is overexpressed in cancer cell lines. We also determined that the region spanning the CEMP1 locus is commonly amplified in a variety of cancers, and finally we found significant overexpression of CEMP1 in leukemia, cervix, breast, prostate and lung cancer. Our findings suggest that CEMP1 exerts modulation of a number of cellular genes, cellular development, cellular growth, cell death, and cell cycle, and molecules associated with cancer."

Methods A cohort of 1378 women and 538 men who initiated statin therapy during 2008–2010 after responding to a survey on childhood adversities, was followed for non-adherence during the first treatment year. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate predictors of non-adherence, defined as the proportion of days covered by dispensed statin tablets <80%. In fully adjusted models including age, education, marital status, current smoking, heavy alcohol use, physical inactivity, obesity, presence of depression and cardiovascular comorbidity, the number of women ranged from 1172 to 1299 and that of men from 473 to 516, because of missing data on specific adversities and covariates. Results Two in three respondents reported at least one of the following six adversities in the family: divorce/separation of the parents, long-term financial difficulties, severe conflicts, frequent fear, severe illness, or alcohol problem of a family member. 51% of women and 44% of men were non-adherent. In men, the number of childhood adversities predicted an increased risk of non-adherence (risk ratio [RR] per adversity 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.21], P for linear trend 0.013). Compared with those reporting no adversities, men reporting 3–6 adversities had a 1.44-fold risk of non-adherence (95% CI 1.12–1.85). Experiencing severe conflicts in the family (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.03–1.57]) and frequent fear of a family member (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00–1.62]) in particular, predicted an increased risk of non-adherence. In women, neither the number of adversities nor any specific type of adversity predicted non-adherence. Conclusions Exposure to childhood adversity may predict non-adherence to preventive cardiovascular medication in men. Usefulness of information on childhood adversities in identification of adults at high risk of non-adherence deserves further research."
https://openalex.org/W1549954750,"Expanded genetic code approaches are a powerful means to add new and useful chemistry to proteins at defined residues positions. One such use is the introduction of non-biological reactive chemical handles for site-specific biocompatible orthogonal conjugation of proteins. Due to our currently limited information on the impact of non-canonical amino acids (nAAs) on the protein structure-function relationship, rational protein engineering is a ""hit and miss"" approach to selecting suitable sites. Furthermore, dogma suggests surface exposed native residues should be the primary focus for introducing new conjugation chemistry. Here we describe a directed evolution approach to introduce and select for in-frame codon replacement to facilitate engineering proteins with nAAs. To demonstrate the approach, the commonly reprogrammed amber stop codon (TAG) was randomly introduced in-frame in two different proteins: the bionanotechnologically important cyt b(562) and therapeutic protein KGF. The target protein is linked at the gene level to sfGFP via a TEV protease site. In absence of a nAA, an in-frame TAG will terminate translation resulting in a non-fluorescent cell phenotype. In the presence of a nAA, TAG will encode for nAA incorporation so instilling a green fluorescence phenotype on E. coli. The presence of endogenously expressed TEV proteases separates in vivo target protein from its fusion to sfGFP if expressed as a soluble fusion product. Using this approach, we incorporated an azide reactive handle and identified residue positions amenable to conjugation with a fluorescence dye via strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC). Interestingly, best positions for efficient conjugation via SPAAC were residues whose native side chain were buried through analysis of their determined 3D structures and thus may not have been chosen through rational protein engineering. Molecular modeling suggests these buried native residues could become partially exposed on substitution to the azide containing nAA."
https://openalex.org/W432191230,"Several Western studies have revealed that among non-diabetics, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels are higher in smokers than non-smokers. While studies conducted in Western populations consistently support this association, a recent meta-analysis reported that studies carried out in non-Western populations, including studies of Chinese, Egyptian, and Japanese-Americans, did not detect any significant differences in HbA1c levels between smokers and non-smokers.We assessed the association between smoking habits and HbA1c levels in the general Korean adult population using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) performed in 2011-2012.A total of 10,241 participants (weighted n=33,946,561 including 16,769,320 men and 17,177,241 women) without diabetes were divided into four categories according to their smoking habits: never smokers (unweighted n/ weighted n=6,349/19,105,564), ex-smokers (unweighted n/ weighted n= 1,912/6,207,144), current light smokers (<15 cigarettes per day, unweighted n/ weighted n=1,205/5,130,073), and current heavy smokers (≥15 cigarettes per day, unweighted n/ weighted n=775/3,503,781).In age- and gender-adjusted comparisons, the HbA1c levels of each group were 5.52 ± 0.01% in non-smokers, 5.49 ± 0.01% in ex-smokers, 5.53 ± 0.01% in light smokers, and 5.61 ± 0.02% in heavy smokers. HbA1c levels were significantly higher in light smokers than in ex-smokers (p = 0.033), and in heavy smokers compared with light smokers (p < 0.001). The significant differences remained after adjusting for age, gender, fasting plasma glucose, heavy alcohol drinking, hematocrit, college graduation, and waist circumference. Linear regression analyses for HbA1c using the above-mentioned variables as covariates revealed that a significant association between current smoking and HbA1c (coefficient 0.021, 95% CI 0.003-0.039, p = 0.019).Current smoking was independently associated with higher HbA1c levels in a cigarette exposure-dependent manner in a representative population of Korean non-diabetic adults. In this study, we have observed an association between smoking status and HbA1c levels in non-diabetics drawn from a non-Western population, consistent with previous findings in Western populations."
https://openalex.org/W1595622977,"Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are becoming major causes of death in developing countries. Risk scoring systems for CVD are needed to prioritize allocation of limited resources. Most of these risk score algorithms have been based on a long array of risk factors including blood markers of lipids. However, risk scoring systems that solely use office-based data, not including laboratory markers, may be advantageous. In the current analysis, we validated the office-based Framingham risk scoring system in Iran. Methods The study used data from the Golestan Cohort in North-East of Iran. The following risk factors were used in the development of the risk scoring method: sex, age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, current smoking, and diabetes. Cardiovascular risk functions for prediction of 10-year risk of fatal CVDs were developed. Results A total of 46,674 participants free of CVD at baseline were included. Predictive value of estimated risks was examined. The resulting Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) was 0.774 (95% CI: 0.762-0.787) in all participants, 0.772 (95% CI: 0.753-0.791) in women, and 0.763 (95% CI: 0.747-0.779) in men. AUC was higher in urban areas (0.790, 95% CI: 0.766-0.815). The predicted and observed risks of fatal CVD were similar in women. However, in men, predicted probabilities were higher than observed. Conclusion The AUC in the current study is comparable to results of previous studies while lipid profile was replaced by body mass index to develop an office-based scoring system. This scoring algorithm is capable of discriminating individuals at high risk versus low risk of fatal CVD."
https://openalex.org/W386831519,"The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factor requires interactions with co-factors for precise regulation of its target genes. Our lab previously reported that the mammalian MEF2A isoform regulates the cardiomyocyte costamere, a critical muscle-specific focal adhesion complex involved in contractility, through its transcriptional control of genes encoding proteins localized to this cytoskeletal structure. To further dissect the transcriptional mechanisms of costamere gene regulation and identify potential co-regulators of MEF2A, a bioinformatics analysis of transcription factor binding sites was performed using the proximal promoter regions of selected costamere genes. One of these predicted sites belongs to the early growth response (EGR) transcription factor family. The EGR1 isoform has been shown to be involved in a number of pathways in cardiovascular homeostasis and disease, making it an intriguing candidate MEF2 coregulator to further characterize. Here, we demonstrate that EGR1 interacts with MEF2A and is a potent and specific repressor of MEF2 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we show that costamere gene expression in cardiomyocytes is dependent on EGR1 transcriptional activity. This study identifies a mechanism by which MEF2 activity can be modulated to ensure that costamere gene expression is maintained at levels commensurate with cardiomyocyte contractile activity."
https://openalex.org/W1687913548,"Age at epilepsy onset has a broad impact on brain plasticity and epilepsy pathomechanisms. Prolonged febrile seizures in early childhood (FS) constitute an initial precipitating insult (IPI) commonly associated with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). FS-MTLE patients may have early disease onset, i.e. just after the IPI, in early childhood, or late-onset, ranging from mid-adolescence to early adult life. The mechanisms governing early (E) or late (L) disease onset are largely unknown. In order to unveil the molecular pathways underlying E and L subtypes of FS-MTLE we investigated global gene expression in hippocampal CA3 explants of FS-MTLE patients submitted to hippocampectomy. Gene coexpression networks (GCNs) were obtained for the E and L patient groups. A network-based approach for GCN analysis was employed allowing: i) the visualization and analysis of differentially expressed (DE) and complete (CO) - all valid GO annotated transcripts - GCNs for the E and L groups; ii) the study of interactions between all the system’s constituents based on community detection and coarse-grained community structure methods. We found that the E-DE communities with strongest connection weights harbor highly connected genes mainly related to neural excitability and febrile seizures, whereas in L-DE communities these genes are not only involved in network excitability but also playing roles in other epilepsy-related processes. Inversely, in E-CO the strongly connected communities are related to compensatory pathways (seizure inhibition, neuronal survival and responses to stress conditions) while in L-CO these communities harbor several genes related to pro-epileptic effects, seizure-related mechanisms and vulnerability to epilepsy. These results fit the concept, based on fMRI and behavioral studies, that early onset epilepsies, although impacting more severely the hippocampus, are associated to compensatory mechanisms, while in late MTLE development the brain is less able to generate adaptive mechanisms, what has implications for epilepsy management and drug discovery."

N2 amplitudes were higher for pictures evoking moral disgust relative to core disgust and neutral pictures, reflecting a violation of social norms. The core disgust pictures elicited larger P3 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes in comparison with the moral disgust pictures which, in turn, elicited larger P3 and LPP amplitudes when compared to the neutral pictures. Taken together, these findings indicated that core and moral disgust pictures elicited different neural activities at various stages of information processing, which provided supporting evidence for the heterogeneity of disgust."
https://openalex.org/W387883284,"In response to stressors, animals can increase the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, resulting in elevated glucocorticoid concentrations. An increase in glucocorticoids results in an increase in heterophils and a decrease in lymphocytes, which ratio (H/L-ratio) is an indicator of stress in birds. The physiological response to a stressor can depend on individual characteristics, like dominance rank, sex and personality. Although the isolated effects of these characteristics on the response to a stressor have been well studied, little is known about the response in relation to a combination of these characteristics. In this study we investigate the relationship between social stress, dominance rank, sex and exploratory behaviour as a validated operational measure of personality in great tits (Parus major). Great tits show consistent individual differences in behaviour and physiology in response to stressors, and exploratory behaviour can be classified as fast or slow exploring. We group-housed four birds, two fast and two slow explorers, of the same sex that were previously singly housed, in an aviary and compared the H/L-ratio, lymphocyte and heterophil count before and after group housing. After experiencing the social context all birds increased their H/L-ratio and heterophil count. Females showed a stronger increase in H/L-ratio and heterophil count than males, which seemed to be related to a higher number of agonistic interactions compared to males. Dominance rank and exploration type did not affect the H/L-ratio or heterophil count. Contrary to our expectations, all birds increased their lymphocyte count. However, this increase was slower for fast than for slow explorers. Our study suggests that personality and sex related differences, but not dominance rank, are associated with changes in an individual's physiological response due to a social context."
https://openalex.org/W2138083763,"Background The transcription factor forkhead box D3 (FOXD3) plays important roles in the development of neural crest and has been shown to suppress the development of various cancers. However, the expression and its potential biological roles of FOXD3 in high-grade gliomas (HGGs) remain unknown. Methods The mRNA and protein expression levels of FOXD3 were examined using real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting in 23 HGG and 13 normal brain samples, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate the expression FOXD3 protein in 184 HGG cases. The association between FOXD3 expression and the prognosis of HGG patients were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models. In addition, we further examined the effects of FOXD3 on the proliferation and serum starvation-induced apoptosis of glioma cells. Results In comparison to normal brain tissues, FOXD3 expression was significantly decreased in HGG tissues at both mRNA and protein levels. Immunohistochemistry further validated the expression of FOXD3 in HGG tissues. Moreover, low FOXD3 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in HGG patients. Depletion of FOXD3 expression promoted glioma cell proliferation and inhibited serum starvation-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of FOXD3 inhibited glioma cell proliferation and promoted serum starvation-induced apoptosis. Conclusions Our results indicated that FOXD3 might serve as an independent prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for HGGs, which warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2215133590,"Angiotensin (Ang) II is the major bioactive peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS); it contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension by inducing vascular contraction and adverse remodeling, thus elevated peripheral resistance. Ang II also activates Src family kinases (SFK) in the vascular system, which has been implicated in cell proliferation and migration. However, the role of SFK in Ang II-induced hypertension is largely unknown. In this study, we found that administration of a SFK inhibitor SU6656 markedly lowered the level of systemic BP in Ang II-treated mice, which was associated with an attenuated phosphorylation of the smooth-muscle myosin-light-chain (MLC) in the mesenteric resistant arteries. In the cultured human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs), pretreatment with SU6656 blocked Ang II-induced MLC phosphorylation and contraction. These results for the first time demonstrate that SFK directly regulate vascular contractile machinery to influence BP. Thus our study provides an additional mechanistic link between Ang II and vasoconstriction via SFK-enhanced MLC phosphorylation in SMCs, and suggests that targeted inhibition of Src may provide a new therapeutic opportunity in the treatment of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W391263690,"Temperature plays a fundamental role for the proper functioning of the brain. However, there are only fragmentary data on brain temperature (T(br)) and its regulation under different physiological conditions.We studied T(br) in the visual cortex of 20 normal subjects serially with a wide temporal window under different states including rest, activation and recovery by a visual stimulation-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Thermometry combined approach. We also studied T(br) in a control region, the centrum semiovale, under the same conditions.Visual cortex mean baseline T(br) was higher than mean body temperature (37.38 vs 36.60, P<0.001). During activation Tbr remained unchanged at first and then showed a small decrease (-0.20 C°) around the baseline value. After the end of activation T(br) increased consistently (+0.60 C°) and then returned to baseline values after some minutes. Centrum semiovale T(br) remained unchanged through rest, visual stimulation and recovery.These findings have several implications, among them that neuronal firing itself is not a major source of heat release in the brain and that there is an aftermath of brain activation that lasts minutes before returning to baseline conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2226058908,"Angiosperm flowers are usually determinate structures that may produce seeds. In some species, flowers can revert from committed flower development back to an earlier developmental phase in a process called floral reversion. The allopolyploid Arabidopsis suecica displays photoperiod-dependent floral reversion in a subset of its flowers, yet little is known about the environmental conditions enhancing this phenotype, or the morphological processes leading to reversion. We have used light and electron microscopy to further describe this phenomenon. Additionally, we have further studied the phenology of flowering and floral reversion in A. suecica. In this study we confirm and expand upon our previous findings that floral reversion in the allopolyploid A. suecica is photoperiod-dependent, and show that its frequency is correlated with the timing for the onset of flowering. Our results also suggest that floral reversion in A. suecica displays natural variation in its penetrance between geographic populations of A. suecica."
https://openalex.org/W1553975437,"Transformer 2β1 (Tra2β1) is a splicing effector protein composed of a core RNA recognition motif flanked by two arginine-serine-rich (RS) domains, RS1 and RS2. Although Tra2β1-dependent splicing is regulated by phosphorylation, very little is known about how protein kinases phosphorylate these two RS domains. We now show that the serine-arginine protein kinase-1 (SRPK1) is a regulator of Tra2β1 and promotes exon inclusion in the survival motor neuron gene 2 (SMN2). To understand how SRPK1 phosphorylates this splicing factor, we performed mass spectrometric and kinetic experiments. We found that SRPK1 specifically phosphorylates 21 serines in RS1, a process facilitated by a docking groove in the kinase domain. Although SRPK1 readily phosphorylates RS2 in a splice variant lacking the N-terminal RS domain (Tra2β3), RS1 blocks phosphorylation of these serines in the full-length Tra2β1. Thus, RS2 serves two new functions. First, RS2 positively regulates binding of the central RNA recognition motif to an exonic splicing enhancer sequence, a phenomenon reversed by SRPK1 phosphorylation on RS1. Second, RS2 enhances ligand exchange in the SRPK1 active site allowing highly efficient Tra2β1 phosphorylation. These studies demonstrate that SRPK1 is a regulator of Tra2β1 splicing function and that the individual RS domains engage in considerable cross-talk, assuming novel functions with regard to RNA binding, splicing, and SRPK1 catalysis.Background: Serine-arginine-rich (SR)-like proteins regulate the alternative splicing of human genes.Results: The serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) phosphorylates transformer 2β1 (Tra2β1) at numerous sites regulating RNA binding, splicing of the survival motor neuron 2 gene, and catalytic function of the kinase domain.Conclusion: The two RS domains interact and regulate Tra2β1 activity in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.Significance: SRPK1 is a regulator of Tra2β1.

https://openalex.org/W388425377,"Walking requires adapting to meet task constraints. Between 5- and 7-years old, children’s walking approximates adult walking without constraints. To examine how children and adults adapt to meet timing constraints, 57 5- to 7-year olds and 20 adults walked to slow and fast audio metronome paces. Both children and adults modified their walking. However, at the slow pace, children had more trouble matching the metronome compared to adults. The youngest children’s walking patterns deviated most from the slow metronome pace, and practice improved their performance. Five-year olds were the only group that did not display carryover effects to the metronome paces. Findings are discussed in relation to what contributes to the development of adaptation in children."
https://openalex.org/W2220854900,"Germ layer induction is one of the earliest events shortly after fertilization that initiates body formation of vertebrate embryos. In Xenopus, the maternally deposited transcriptional factor VegT promotes the expression of zygotic Nodal/Activin ligands that further form a morphogen gradient along the vegetal-animal axis and trigger the induction of the three germ layers. Here we found that SCP3 (small C-terminal domain phosphatase 3) is maternally expressed and vegetally enriched in Xenopus embryos and is essential for the timely induction of germ layers. SCP3 is required for the full activation of Nodal/Activin and bone morphogenetic protein signals and functions via dephosphorylation in the linker regions of receptor-regulated Smads. Consistently, the linker regions of receptor-regulated Smads are heavily phosphorylated in fertilized eggs, and this phosphorylation is gradually removed when embryos approach the midblastula transition. Knockdown of maternal SCP3 attenuates these dephosphorylation events and the activation of Nodal/Activin and bone morphogenetic protein signals after midblastula transition. This study thus suggested that the maternal SCP3 serves as a vegetally enriched, intrinsic factor to ensure a prepared status of Smads for their activation by the upcoming ligands during germ layer induction of Xenopus embryos. Background: In Xenopus embryos, zygotically activated TGFβ signaling regulates the formation of three germ layers. Results: Vegetally enriched SCP3 is required for TGFβ signaling and germ layer induction and functions by removing the inhibitory linker phosphorylation on R-Smads. Conclusion: SCP3 ensures TGFβ-mediated germ layer formation. Significance: This work presents a novel mechanism by which maternal factors control the response of embryonic blastomeres toward morphogen signals."
https://openalex.org/W415123709,"In Plasmodium, the membrane of intracellular parasites is initially formed during invasion as an invagination of the red blood cell surface, which forms a barrier between the parasite and infected red blood cells in asexual blood stage parasites. The membrane proteins of intracellular parasites of Plasmodium species have been identified such as early-transcribed membrane proteins (ETRAMPs) and exported proteins (EXPs). However, there is little or no information regarding the intracellular parasite membrane in Plasmodium vivax. In the present study, recombinant PvETRAMP11.2 (PVX_003565) and PvEXP1 (PVX_091700) were expressed and evaluated antigenicity tests using sera from P. vivax-infected patients. A large proportion of infected individuals presented with IgG antibody responses against PvETRAMP11.2 (76.8%) and PvEXP1 (69.6%). Both of the recombinant proteins elicited high antibody titers capable of recognizing parasites of vivax malaria patients. PvETRAMP11.2 partially co-localized with PvEXP1 on the intracellular membranes of immature schizont. Moreover, they were also detected at the apical organelles of newly formed merozoites of mature schizont. We first proposed that these proteins might be synthesized in the preceding schizont stage, localized on the parasite membranes and apical organelles of infected erythrocytes, and induced high IgG antibody responses in patients."
https://openalex.org/W1590948879,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that predominantly affects young adults. The genetic contributions to this multifactorial disease were underscored by a genome wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetic Consortium in a multinational cohort prompting the discovery of 57 non-MHC MS-associated common genetic variants. Hitherto, few of these newly reported variants have been replicated in larger independent patient cohorts. We genotyped a cohort of 1033 MS patients and 644 healthy controls with a consistent genetic background for the 57 non-MHC variants reported to be associated with MS by the first large GWAS as well as the HLA DRB1*1501 tagging SNP rs3135388. We robustly replicated three of the 57 non-MHC reported MS-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, our study revealed several genotype-genotype combinations with an evidently higher degree of disease association than the genotypes of the single SNPs. We further correlated well-defined clinical phenotypes, i.e. ataxia, visual impairment due to optic neuritis and paresis with single SNPs and genotype combinations, and identified several associations. The results may open new avenues for clinical implications of the MS associated genetic variants reported from large GWAS."
https://openalex.org/W359123393,"RV144 was a community-based HIV vaccine efficacy trial conducted in HIV-uninfected adults in Thailand, where dengue virus continues to cause a large number of infections every year. We attempted to document the accuracy of clinically diagnosed dengue episodes reported as serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) and examine whether dengue serology would support the clinical diagnosis. Subjects without a clinical dengue diagnosis but with an infection or idiopathic fever were selected as a control population. Dengue serology was performed by hemagglutination inhibition on plasma samples. A total of 124 clinical dengue episodes were reported (103 SAEs and 21 AEs). Overall 82.6% of the clinically diagnosed dengue episodes were supported by a positive dengue serology: 71.4% of the AEs and 85.0% of the SAEs. Of the 100 subjects with both clinical dengue and positive serology, all presented with fever, 83% with leucopenia, 54% with thrombocytopenia, and 27% with hemorrhagic symptoms. All episodes resolved spontaneously without sequellae. Only two of 15 subjects with a negative serology presented with fever. The sensitivity and specificity of clinical dengue diagnosis were 90.9% and 74.4%, respectively, when compared to the control population, and with a positive predictive value of 82.6% and negative predictive value of 84.7% when compared to dengue serology. Clinical diagnosis of dengue is an accurate method of dengue diagnosis in adults in Thailand. Large-scale clinical trials offer the opportunity to systematically study infectious diseases such as dengue and other infections that may occur during the trial."
https://openalex.org/W2123217082,"The current study aimed to establish a fine-grained, efficient characterization of the concurrent neuropsychological contributions to social functioning in neuropsychologically-referred youth. A secondary aim was to demonstrate a useful statistic approach for such investigations (Partial Least Squares Regression; PLSR), which is underutilized in this field. Forty-five participants (70 - 164 months; Mage = 110.89; 34 male) were recruited from a large neuropsychological assessment clinic. Participants completed subtests from the NEPSY-II focusing on neuropsychological constructs that have been linked to social functioning (affect decoding, social memory, motor skills, visuomotor skills, response inhibition, attention and set-shifting, and verbal comprehension). Mothers completed the BASC-2, from which Atypicality and Social Skills scales were analyzed. PLSR revealed that difficulty with social memory, sensorimotor integration, and the ability to attend to and accurately discriminate auditory stimuli combine to best predict atypical or ""odd"" behavior. In terms of social skills, two factors emerged. The first factor indicated that, counterintuitively, greater emotional perception, visuospatial perception, ability to attend to and accurately discriminate auditory stimuli, and understand instructions was related to poorer social skills. The second factor indicated that a pattern of better facial memory, and sensorimotor ability (execution & integration) characterized a distinct profile of greater social ability. PLSR results were compared to traditional OLS and Backwards Stepwise regression approaches to demonstrate utility. Results also suggested that these findings were consistent across age, gender, and diagnostic group, indicating common neuropsychological substrates of social functioning in this sample of referred youth. Overall, this study provides the first characterization of optimized combinations of neuropsychological variables in predicting social functioning in assessment clinic-referred youth, and introduces to this literature a valuable statistical approach for obtaining such characterizations."

The proposed method is based on a BP-Hopfield-RGB (BHR) composite network. Complex environmental factors are integrated in the BP neural network. Dynamic monitoring data are then automatically classified in the Hopfield network. The deformation risk level is combined with the RGB color space model and is displayed visually in real time, after which experiments are conducted with the use of an ultrasonic omnidirectional sensor device for structural deformation monitoring. The proposed method is also compared with some typical methods using a benchmark dataset. Results show that the BHR composite network visualizes the deformation monitoring process in real time and can dynamically indicate dangerous zones."
https://openalex.org/W421768864,"Recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) has been used to deliver vaccine candidate antigens against infectious diseases and cancer. MVA is a potent viral vector for inducing high magnitudes of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells; however the cellular immune responses to a recombinant antigen in MVA could be further enhanced by increasing transgene expression. Previous reports showed the importance of utilizing an early poxviral promoter for increasing transgene expression and therefore enhancing cellular immune responses. However, the vaccinia D10 decapping enzyme is reported to target and decap vaccinia virus early transcripts - a mechanism that could limit the usefulness of early promoters in MVA viral vectors if this enzyme shows the same activity in this closely related virus. Therefore, we attempted to increase transgene expression in recombinant MVA by inserting the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream of a transgene sequence that is controlled by the B8R early promoter, and assessed D10 enzyme decapping activity in MVA. The aim of the IRES element was to initiate translation of the transgene transcript (after the removal of the cap structure by the D10 decapping protein) in a cap-independent manner. Here, we report that overexpression of the D10 decapping protein, in trans, in MVA reduced growth and transgene expression; however, the IRES element was not able to compensate for the negative effect of the D10 decapping protein. Recombinant MVA with EMCV IRES induced levels of both gene expression and transcription that were similar to the control recombinant MVA, encoding the same transgene but without the IRES element. Both viruses were tested in BALB/c mice and induced similar magnitudes of epitope-specific CD8+ T cells. This work indicates that the MVA version of the D10 decapping enzyme, overexpressed using a plasmid, is functional, but its negative effect on transgene expression by recombinant MVA cannot be overcome by the use of the EMCV IRES inserted upstream of the transgene initiation codon."
