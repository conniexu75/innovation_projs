The steps are of amplitude 8.1 nm, the distance between adjacent tubulin binding sites, and are powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. We have asked: how many steps does kinesin take for each molecule of ATP that it hydrolyzes? To answer this question, the motility and ATP hydrolysis of recombinant, heterotetrameric and homodimeric conventional Drosophila kinesins adsorbed to 200-nm-diameter casein-coated silica beads were assayed under identical, single-molecule conditions. Division of the speed by the maximum microtubule-activated ATPase rate gave a stoichiometry of 1.08 ± 0.09 steps for each ATP hydrolyzed at 1 mmATP. Therefore, under low loads in which the drag force ≪ 1 pN, coupling between the chemical and mechanical cycles of kinesin is tight, consistent with conventional power stroke models. Our results rule out models that require two or more ATPs/step, such as some thermal ratchet models, or that propose multiple steps powered by single ATPs.

Conventional kinesin is a protein machine that steps along the surface of a microtubule as it carries a membrane-bound organelle toward the periphery of a cell (1Coy D.L. Howard J. Curr. Opin.

Despite intensive biochemical, biophysical, and structural investigations over the last few years, there remains considerable uncertainty as to the mechanism by which the stepping is coupled to ATP hydrolysis.In this work, we address the question: what is the stoichiometry of kinesin? In other words, how many steps does kinesin take for each ATP that it hydrolyzes? This question is important because it tests different models proposed to explain how motor proteins such as kinesin and myosin work. For example, one class of “thermal ratchet” models predicts that the stoichiometry is ≤0.5 steps/ATP (17Astumian R.D. Bier M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 637-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 18Rousselet J. Salome L. Ajdari A. Prost J. Nature. 1994; 370: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar); these models postulate that ATP hydrolysis rectifies a diffusive motion in such a way that a step only occurs if the diffusion istoward the next binding site. Because there is an equal probability that the motor diffuses away from the next binding site (i.e. in the wrong direction), this model predicts that on average at least two molecules of ATP are hydrolyzed per forward step. A stoichiometry of less than one could also be due to “futile” hydrolysis cycles, those that fail to produce steps and lead to “slippage” between the mechanical and chemical cycles. Other models postulate a stoichiometry greater than 1 and have been applied to reconcile the high efficiency of muscle with the mechanical properties of muscle fibers (19Huxley A.F. Simmons R.M. Nature. 1971; 233: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar, 20Lombardi V. Piazzesi G. Linari M. Nature. 1992; 355: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or to reconcile the large apparent “interaction distance” between myosin and actin with the smaller physical size of the myosin head (21Yanagida T. Arata T. Oosawa F. Nature. 1985; 316: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Higuchi H. Goldman Y.E. Nature. 1991; 352: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, there are alternative explanations of these results that do not require more than one step/ATP hydrolysis (23Howard J. Nature. 1997; 389: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). On the middle ground are conventional “tightly coupled” models in which the mechanical and chemical cycles are assumed to be strictly coordinated, predicting a stoichiometry of 1.Some clues to the mechanochemical stoichiometry of kinesin have already been obtained. High resolution tracking experiments show that one ATP produces no more than one step, because bursts of multiple 8-nm steps are not observed at limiting, low ATP concentrations (5Kojima H. Muta E. Higuchi H. Yanagida T. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2012-2022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 14Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 24Hua W. Young E.C. Fleming M.L. Gelles J. Nature. 1997; 388: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the linear relationship between speed and ATP concentration (at low ATP concentration) indicates that one ATP is sufficient to produce a step (8Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar); if two (or more) ATPs were required, then the speed would depend on the square (or a higher power) of the ATP concentration. This conclusion is supported by tracking experiments at low ATP concentration showing that time intervals between steps are exponentially distributed (5Kojima H. Muta E. Higuchi H. Yanagida T. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2012-2022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 14Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar); if two (or more) ATPs were required, the interval distribution would be peaked rather than monotonically decreasing. These results are consistent with a stoichiometry of 1 but do not prove it. For example, the latter results imply that the binding of one ATP molecule can result in a step, but they provide no information about the likelihood that a step will actually occur. Thus these experiments do not measure the stoichiometry.In this work, we measure the stoichiometry of kinesin by comparing its rate of ATP hydrolysis to its rate of stepping. Under conditions in which a single kinesin molecule is moving along a microtubule, division of the speed of movement (v) by the maximal, microtubule-stimulated ATPase rate/molecule (k cat) yields the fuel economy of the motor (the distance/ATP hydrolyzed). Division of the economy by the step size, d = 8.1 nm (25Hyman A.A. Chretién D. Arnal I. Wade R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), then yields the number of steps/ATP hydrolyzed, i.e. the stoichiometry (n) as shown. n=vd·kcatEquation 1 Until now, kinesin ATPase assays have been typically done with molecules in solution, whereas motility assays have been done with the motors bound to a solid support (e.g. to a glass surface or bead). This has resulted in apparent stoichiometries varying from as high as 200 for native, full-length Drosophila kinesin (v = 900 nm/s, k cat = 0.60 s−1; Ref. 26Saxton W.M. Porter M.E. Cohn S.A. Scholey J.M. Raff E.C. McIntosh J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) to as low as 0.008 for a recombinant,Drosophila kinesin motor domain-glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein (v = 1.5 nm/s,k cat = 24 s−1; Ref. 27Stewart R.J. Thaler J.P. Goldstein L.S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5209-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This 25,000-fold range of stoichiometries, together with an inverse correlation between speed and ATPase rate, suggests that binding of kinesin to a solid support may have profound effects on the speed and/or ATPase. For this reason, we have measured the ATP hydrolysis rate of kinesin under identical conditions to those used to assay the motility, namely with kinesin bound to 200-nm-diameter silica beads. At low kinesin-to-bead ratios where the motility is due to single motors, the stoichiometry is unity.RESULTSTo measure the stoichiometry of kinesin, the motility and ATP hydrolysis of recombinant, heterotetrameric and homodimeric conventional Drosophila kinesin adsorbed to 200-nm-diameter casein-coated silica beads were assayed under identical, single-molecule conditions. Data from three kinesin preparations are summarized in Table I.Table IKinesin stoichiometryPreparationSpeed ± S.E. (v)ATPase ± S.E.

Data from two kinesin preparations with light chains (α2β2) and one preparation without light chains (α2). The stoichiometry was calculated by dividing the distance per ATP by the step size (8.1 nm) and multiplying by 0.97 to correct for the effect of ADP build-up on the ATPase (see text). The uncertainties were calculated by adding the variances associated with the speed, ATPase, concentration (S.E./mean = 0.05), temperature in motility assay (S.E./mean = 0.04, corresponding to S.E. in the temperature of 0.5 °C), and temperature in the ATPase assay (S.E./mean = 0.04). Open table in a new tab Bead MotilityThe movement of the kinesin-coated beads along microtubules adsorbed to the silanized surface of the experimental chamber was observed by differential interference contrast microscopy (Fig. 2 a). At the resolution of the video images, the motion was smooth with fewer than 1% of the beads stopping or pausing for greater than 0.5 s. The distance traveled during each run of a bead along a microtubule varied greatly from bead to bead, even at the same kinesin-bead ratio (Fig.2 b). At kinesin-bead ratios of less than one, the distances were approximately exponentially distributed, consistent with detachment being a random (Poisson) process. At the lowest kinesin-bead ratio, 0.088 kinesins/bead, fewer than 10% of those beads with motors on them have more than one motor; therefore most of these runs are attributed to a single kinesin molecule. The mean run length of 1.2 μm was similar to that measured by Block et al. (9Block S.M. Goldstein L.S.B. Schnapp B.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 284-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) using native squid kinesin. At the highest kinesin-bead ratio, 5.8, the average run length was greatest (Figs. 2 b and3 b) due to an increase in the frequency of long runs. Presumably these long runs are due to two or more motors powering one bead; for two kinesin molecules to interact with the same microtubule at that density, we estimate that each kinesin must have a “reach” of about 25 nm.Figure 3Attachment, movement, and speed of kinesin-coated beads on microtubules.

The attachment rate showed signs of saturation at the highest motor-bead ratio, such that the probability of a bead binding to a microtubule during a diffusive encounter at a kinesin-bead ratio of 4 is roughly half that of a bead saturated with kinesin. This indicates that a high proportion of the adsorbed motors are active, because otherwise there would be no saturation. This supports the radiometric assays described under “Experimental Procedures” showing that almost all the motors adsorbed to beads can bind to microtubules.The speed at which beads moved along microtubules was independent of the kinesin-bead ratio (Fig. 3 c), in agreement with earlier studies on bovine (8Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) and squid (9Block S.M. Goldstein L.S.B. Schnapp B.J.

The mean speed was 882 ± 14 nm/s (mean ± S.E., n = 129) for this preparation at 25 °C.ATPase RateThe rate of ATP hydrolysis by kinesin bound to the 200-nm-diameter beads was measured using a modified malachite green assay. The kinesin-bead ratio was = 0.2, ensuring that greater than 90% of the beads with kinesin bound to them had only one kinesin molecule. The hydrolysis rate increased as the microtubule concentration was increased (Fig. 4), and the data were fitted with the Michaelis-Menten equation. For the α2β2 preparation whose motility is characterized in Figs. 2 and 3, the maximal microtubule-stimulated hydrolysis rate was estimated to be 94 ± 13 s−1/kinesin molecule (mean ± S.E.). The half-maximal hydrolysis rate occurred at a tubulin concentration of 11 ± 3 μm (mean ± S.E.). Similar results were obtained with other kinesin preparations including α2 kinesin (Table I).Figure 4Steady-state microtubule-stimulated ATPase rate of recombinant heterotetrameric kinesin (α2β2,open circles) and homodimeric kinesin (α2, closed circles) adsorbed to 200-nm-diameter silica beads.

First, if a bead has two (or more) motors on it, both motors may not be fully activated. At a kinesin-bead ratio of 0.2, ∼10% of kinesin-beads possess multiple kinesin molecules. To determine whether multiple molecules on a bead are each activated to the same extent as a single kinesin molecule bound to single bead, the kinesin-bead ratio was increased 10-fold and the ATP hydrolysis rate/kinesin molecule was measured. At a kinesin-bead ratio of 2.0, 86% of kinesin molecules are bound to beads possessing at least one other kinesin molecule; the ATP hydrolysis rate/kinesin at 10 μm tubulin of 32 ± 1 s−1 was identical to the rate at a kinesin-bead ratio of 0.2, 32 ± 1 s−1, indicating that several kinesin molecules on a single bead can be fully activated by microtubules.A second way that the ATPase rate might be underestimated is if, over the course of an ATP hydrolysis assay, the depletion of ATP and the accumulation of ADP slow down the hydrolysis reaction. To minimize this effect, no more than 5% of the ATP was hydrolyzed during the course of our experiments. To estimate what effect the accumulation of a low concentration of ADP had on the measured hydrolysis rates, we assayed microtubule gliding speeds and ATPase rates in the presence of ADP. At 10% ADP ([ATP] = 0.9 mm, [ADP] = 0.1 mm), the microtubule gliding speed was reduced 13% from 610 ± 10 nm/s (n = 75) to 530 ± 10 nm/s (n = 75). The corresponding ATP hydrolysis rate at ∼8 μmtubulin in the absence of beads was reduced 34% from 10.1 ± 0.4 s−1 to 6.7 ± 0.3 s−1. These results suggest that the ADP accumulation decreases the instantaneous kinesin hydrolysis rate in two ways: by decreasing the rate at which kinesin moves along a microtubule and also by decreasing its apparent affinity for microtubules. The calculation of kinesin fuel economy and stoichiometry were corrected for this effect (see the legend to TableI).Kinesin Fuel Economy and StoichiometryDividing the speed of kinesin adsorbed to a silica bead by its maximum microtubule-stimulated hydrolysis rate yields an average fuel economy of 9.4 ± 1.3 and 9.9 ± 1.9 nm/ATP for the two preparations containing light chains and 8.7 ± 0.7 nm/ATP for the preparation lacking light chains (Table I). Based on our controls, we expect the fuel economies to be overestimated by ∼3%, due to the build-up of ADP in the ATPase assay but not in the motility assay. Correcting for this overestimate and dividing by the step size of 8.1 nm gives an average stoichiometry of 1.08 ± 0.09 steps/ATP hydrolyzed (data from the three preparations weighted by the reciprocals of their variances). The error is based on the uncertainties in the speed, the ATPase rate, the kinesin concentration measured using the radionucleotide assay, and the uncertainties of temperatures in the motility and ATPase assays (see the legend to Table I).Our estimate of the stoichiometry depends crucially on the measurement of the specific activity of the kinesin enzyme. In this study, the concentration of active kinesin was measured as the number of sites that can exchange radioactively labeled ATP with unlabeled nucleotide divided by two because each kinesin molecule has two heads. We showed that adsorbing kinesin to the silica beads did not affect the concentration of active enzyme. Furthermore, almost all of the kinesin adsorbed to the beads with a geometry favorable for binding microtubules: 86% of the adsorbed motors were stimulated by microtubules to release their bound nucleotide (“Experimental Procedures.”). Therefore, even though the adsorption of kinesin to the beads is nonspecific, a large fraction of the enzyme remains active with respect to nucleotide exchange and microtubule binding. A potential caveat to using nucleotide exchange to assay activity is that the time scale of exchange is minutes, whereas the time scale of the motility assay is seconds, the duration of the runs that the kinesin-coated beads make along the microtubules. It remains formally possible, therefore, that kinesin might switch between an active motile state and a quiescent immotile state on the time scale of tens of seconds. If this were the case, the quiescent state would be short lived enough that there would still be full exchange of nucleotide; as a result the measured ATPase rate would underestimate the true ATPase rate of the active motile enzyme, and the stoichiometry would be overestimated. However, a number of arguments show that the fraction of motors in such a quiescent state is small. First, if the quiescent state were an attached state, then we would have observed kinesin-coated beads binding to the microtubules for several seconds without moving. But this was not seen (less than 1% of beads failed to move continuously). On the other hand, if the quiescent state were a detached state, then we would expect that only the nonquiescent fraction of the motors would be attached to the microtubules even at very high tubulin concentrations. When the motors are attached to beads as in our assays, this is difficult to test. However, Hackney (31Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16508-16511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used centrifugation assays on two-headed Drosophila kinesin in solution to show that the microtubule concentration required for activating the ATPase is identical to that required for binding. In other words, at high tubulin concentration all the motors are bound to the microtubules, ruling out the possibility of significant population of a quiescent, detached state.DISCUSSIONBy dividing the speed of movement of silica beads moving under the influence of single kinesin molecules by the ATP hydrolysis rate of the same beads under the same experimental conditions, we have shown that kinesin makes on average 1.08 ± 0.09 (mean ± S.E.) 8-nm steps for each molecule of ATP that it hydrolyzes. This is consistent with a stoichiometry of 1. Because our measurements were made on an ensemble of motors, we cannot discern whether kinesin takes one step after hydrolyzing one ATP molecule (1:1 coupling) or whether kinesin takes two consecutive steps after hydrolyzing two ATPs (2:2 coupling). In either case, one 8-nm step is produced per ATP hydrolyzed. However, mechanical measurements of single molecules at rate-limiting ATP concentrations (5Kojima H. Muta E. Higuchi H. Yanagida T. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2012-2022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 14Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 24Hua W. Young E.C. Fleming M.L. Gelles J. Nature. 1997; 388: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) show that there are not clusters of 8-nm steps as would be expected if the coupling were 2:2 or some higher multiple. Therefore, taking our chemical data together with the mechanical recordings, we conclude that the coupling is 1:1,i.e. one ATP hydrolysis cycle results in a single step along a microtubule.Under the low load conditions used in these experiments, the coupling between motility and ATP hydrolysis is tight; a stoichiometry of 1.08 ± 0.09 means that at least 90% of the hydrolysis cycles produce a mechanical step (0.90 = 1.08 − 2 × 0.09 = mean − 2 × S.E.). The load in these assays is very small; the drag force associated with pulling a 200-nm diameter bead at 1 μm/s is only ∼0.002 pN (32Berg H.C. Random Walks in Biology. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1983: 56Google Scholar), which is <0.1% of the maximum force of ∼6 pN that a kinesin molecule can generate (10Hunt A.J. Gittes F. Howard J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 766-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 11Svoboda K. Block S.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 773-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 12Meyhöfer E. Howard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Whether the coupling remains tight at high load is not known.A stoichiometry of 1 is consistent with the power stroke model and other models that propose a unitary coupling between the chemical and mechanical cycles of a motor (e.g. Refs. 23Howard J. Nature. 1997; 389: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 33Lymn R.W. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, and 34Eisenberg E. Hill T.L. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1978; 33: 55-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our results rule out any model of chemomechanical transduction that requires two or more ATP/step (n ≤ 0.5), such as the thermal ratchet models discussed in the Introduction. It also rules out other models mentioned that propose multiple steps powered from by single ATP (n ≥ 2). Conventional kinesin is a protein machine that steps along the surface of a microtubule as it carries a membrane-bound organelle toward the periphery of a cell (1Coy D.L. Howard J. Curr. Opin.

Despite intensive biochemical, biophysical, and structural investigations over the last few years, there remains considerable uncertainty as to the mechanism by which the stepping is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. In this work, we address the question: what is the stoichiometry of kinesin? In other words, how many steps does kinesin take for each ATP that it hydrolyzes? This question is important because it tests different models proposed to explain how motor proteins such as kinesin and myosin work. For example, one class of “thermal ratchet” models predicts that the stoichiometry is ≤0.5 steps/ATP (17Astumian R.D. Bier M. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2065053969,"Metalloprotease disintegrins are a family of membrane-anchored glycoproteins that are known to function in fertilization, myoblast fusion, neurogenesis, and ectodomain shedding of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Here we report the analysis of the intracellular maturation and catalytic activity of the widely expressed metalloprotease disintegrin MDC9. Our results suggest that the pro-domain of MDC9 is removed by a furin-type pro-protein convertase in the secretory pathway before the protein emerges on the cell surface. The soluble metalloprotease domain of MDC9 cleaves the insulin B-chain, a generic protease substrate, providing the first evidence that MDC9 is catalytically active. Soluble MDC9 appears to have distinct specificities for cleaving candidate substrate peptides compared with the TNF-α convertase (TACE/ADAM17). The catalytic activity of MDC9 can be inhibited by hydroxamic acid-type metalloprotease inhibitors in the low nanomolar range, in one case with up to 50-fold selectivity for MDC9 versus TACE. Peptides mimicking the predicted cysteine-switch region of MDC9 or TACE inhibit both enzymes in the low micromolar range, providing experimental evidence for regulation of metalloprotease disintegrins via a cysteine-switch mechanism. Finally, MDC9 is shown to become phosphorylated when cells are treated with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a known inducer of protein ectodomain shedding. This work implies that removal of the inhibitory pro-domain of MDC9 by a furin-type pro-protein convertase in the secretory pathway is a prerequisite for protease activity. After pro-domain removal, additional steps, such as protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation, may be involved in regulating the catalytic activity of MDC9, which is likely to target different substrates than the related TNF-α-convertase."

RGS4 is a GTPase-activating protein for Giand Gq class α subunits. In the present study, we used knockouts of Gq class genes in mice to evaluate the potency and selectivity of RGS4 in modulating Ca2+ signaling transduced by different Gq-coupled receptors. RGS4 inhibited phospholipase C activity and Ca2+ signaling in a receptor-selective manner in both permeabilized cells and cells dialyzed with RGS4 through a patch pipette. Receptor-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ signaling by RGS4 was observed in acini prepared from the rat and mouse pancreas. The response of mouse pancreatic acini to carbachol was about 4- and 33-fold more sensitive to RGS4 than that of bombesin and cholecystokinin (CCK), respectively. RGS1 and RGS16 were also potent inhibitors of Gq-dependent Ca2+signaling and acted in a receptor-selective manner. RGS1 showed approximately 1000-fold higher potency in inhibiting carbachol than CCK-dependent signaling. RGS16 was as effective as RGS1 in inhibiting carbachol-dependent signaling but only partially inhibited the response to CCK. By contrast, RGS2 inhibited the response to carbachol and CCK with equal potency. The same pattern of receptor-selective inhibition by RGS4 was observed in acinar cells from wild type and several single and double Gq class knockout mice. Thus, these receptors appear to couple Gq class α subunit isotypes equally.

Many cells express multiple receptors that each activates the Gqsignaling pathway (2Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar). For example, pancreatic acinar cells respond to acetylcholine, bombesin and cholecystokinin (CCK) by intense activation of PLC to generate IP3 and mobilize Ca2+ from internal stores. In a recent study we showed that, although these three agonists activate the same Gq-regulated signaling pathway to mobilize the same Ca2+ pool, each agonist evokes a distinct pattern of Ca2+ wave propagation (3Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signaling in pancreatic acini triggers the exocytotic release of digestive enzymes from granules adjacent to the secretory membrane (4Muallem S. Lee M.L. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An intriguing question in cell signaling is how different agonists can stimulate the same Gq-coupled pathway to generate distinct spatial and/or temporal patterns of Ca2+ response within the same cell. Although signaling in pancreatic acinar cells is dependent on agonist binding to Gq-coupled receptors, several experiments suggested that Ca2+ release was also regulated by a novel mechanism that controlled G protein signaling. First, Ca2+ release evoked by carbachol, bombesin, or CCK was equally inhibited by titration with proteins that sequestered Gβγ and with antisera that specifically recognized Gqclass α subunits (3Xu X.

Third, maximal stimulation with each of these agonists generated roughly equal levels of IP3. These results suggest that all three agonists stimulate their receptors to activate the same amount of Gαq/11. Nevertheless, we found that GTPγS differentially activated, and GDPβS differentially inhibited, signaling by the various agonists acting in these cells (3Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol.

These effects of guanine nucleotides suggested that G protein activity was differentially regulated by an unknown intracellular protein(s) that acted in a receptor-dependent manner.

Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanisms that may provide more precise regulatory specificity have been enigmatic. To date there is no information on the potency or selectivity with which mammalian RGS proteins modulate the same G protein α subunit during its response to different receptors. This highlights the need to analyze RGS proteins in intact cells under controlled conditions to assess their potency and specificity of action. In the present study, we examined the role of RGS4 and other RGS proteins in regulating Ca2+ signaling in pancreatic acinar cells. RGS4 inhibited Ca2+ signaling assayed either by measuring agonist-dependent Ca2+ mobilization in streptolysin O (SLO)-permeabilized cells or Ca2+-activated Cl− current in intact cells. The potency of RGS4 was exceedingly high in intact cells, and GTPγS reversed the inhibitory action of RGS4. This suggests that catalysis of GTPase activity is the dominant mechanism by which RGS4 regulates Ca2+ signaling. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence for receptor selectivity in RGS4 inhibition of PLCβ and Ca2+ signaling. Even more pronounced receptor selectivity was measured with RGS1 and RGS16. On the other hand, RGS2 showed similar potency in inhibiting m3- and CCK-dependent Ca2+ signaling. The potential role of the α subunits in determining differential sensitivity to RGS4 was analyzed using knockout mice. Deletion of individual Gq class α subunit genes or combinations thereof had no effect on the receptor-specific action of RGS4. Thus, specificity of RGS protein actions depends on their interaction with the receptor complex rather than their interaction with a specific Gq class α subunit. Recombinant RGS1, RGS2, RGS4, and RGS16 proteins were tagged at the N terminus with the sequence MH6MG using the pET19b and a modified pQE60 expression vector, respectively (Qiagen), expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described (10Berman D.M.

Briefly, a 10-ml overnight culture grown at 37 °C in T7 medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose was used to inoculate 2 liter of T7/100 μg/ml ampicillin medium at 30 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) induction was performed at OD600 of 0.6–0.8, and cell cultures were shaken 4 h prior to harvest. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in TBP (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) and DNase I (5 μg/ml) were added, and cells were inoculated on ice to complete lysis and DNA digestion. The total lysate was centrifuged (12,000 ×g for 30 min) at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 2-ml nickel-NTA column pre-equilibrated with TBP buffer. The column was washed with 20 ml of TBP and 0.2 m NaCl. The final wash was performed using 10 ml of TBP with 5 mmimidazole (pH 8.0). The protein was eluted twice with 2 ml elution buffer (TBP containing 200 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of 50 mm HEPES, 2 mmdithiothreitol buffer (pH 8.0) at 4 °C, and further concentrated with a Centricon 10 device (Amicon). Mice deficient in Gα11 were produced as described (33Offermanns S. Zhao L.-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, the murine Gα11 gene was disrupted by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells. Integration of the Gα11targeting vector replaced exons 3, 4, and a portion of 5 with several translation termination codons present in the reverse orientation of the PGK::Neo transgene. Gα11−/− mice are viable and fertile. Gα14 knockout mice were produced by disrupting the Gα14 gene in ES cells by homologous integration of a PGK::Neo expression cassette into the exon that encodes amino acid residues Ser-121 to Lys-154. Gα14−/− mice are viable and fertile with no apparent behavioral or morphologic defects. Gα11−/−;Gα14−/− double homozygous null mice were obtained from intercrossing the offspring of the single knockout mice. To produce Gα15−/− knockout mice, integration of the Gα15 targeting vector replaced exons 3, 4, and a portion of 5 with PGK::Neo in the inverse orientation. Gα15−/− mice are viable and fertile with no apparent behavioral or morphologic defects. Production of Gαq−/− mice was described (34Offermanns S. Hashimoto K. Watanabe M. Sun W. Kurihara H.

Gαq−/−;Gα15−/− double homozygous null mice were obtained by intercrossing the offspring of the single knockout mice. All WT and mutant mice were of 129/SvEv × C57BL/6 genetic background. Two strains of double homozygous null mice were unavailable for this study. Gαq−/−;Gα11−/− mice could not be obtained as they die during embryogenesis (33Offermanns S. Zhao L.-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I.

Pancreatic acini and single pancreatic acinar cells from the rat and mouse pancreas were prepared by standard collagenase and trypsin digestion procedures as described (3Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J.

The cells were suspended in solution A containing (in mm): NaCl 140, KCl 5, Hepes 10 (pH 7.4), MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1, and glucose 10. The cells were kept on ice until use. The procedures used to measure agonist- and IP3-evoked Ca2+ release in SLO-permeabilized pancreatic acini are essentially as described (3Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol.

In brief, the acini were washed and suspended in a KCl-based permeabilization medium containing ATP regeneration system and SLO. The cells were allowed to reduce medium [Ca2+] to 50–100 nm before stimulation. The same protocol was used to measure IP3 production except that the volume of the reaction medium was increased from 400 to 500 μl. At designated times monitoring of [Ca2+] was interrupted to remove 25–50 μl of duplicate samples to 25–50 μl of an ice-cold 15% perchloric acid. At the end of the incubation periods with all agonists and at least 10 min after the last stimulation, precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation and IP3 content of the supernatant were evaluated by a radioligand assay (3Xu X.

The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (37Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar) was used to measure the effect of agonists on Cl−current. The pipette solution and recording conditions were set to optimize detection of the Ca2+-activated Cl−current as a reporter of changes in [Ca2+]i (for details, see Ref. 5Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at room temperature. The patch clamp output was filtered at 20 Hz. Recording was performed with pClamp 6 and a digi-Data 1200 interface (Axon Instruments). In all experiments, the Cl− and cation equilibrium potentials were about 0 mV. Cl− current was recorded at a holding potential of −40 mV. Current amplitude of stimulated cells was within 15% in a given cell preparation but varied between 50 and 150 pA/pF between cell preparations. Therefore, each experiment included at least one control and the inhibition of signaling by RGS proteins was compared with a control performed with a cell from the same preparation. Previous studies showed that RGS4 added to isolated membranes (28Saugstad J.A. Marino J.J. Folk J.A. Hepler J.R. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 905-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hepler J.R.

A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) inhibited Gq-dependent PLCβ activation. Fig.1 shows that addition of RGS4 to permeabilized rat pancreatic acinar cells effectively blocked agonist-dependent, Gq-coupled Ca2+release from internal stores. The permeabilized cells reduced [Ca2+] in the incubation medium to about 50 nm and responded to maximal stimulation with carbachol by releasing about 75% of the Ca2+ that is accessible to IP3 (Fig. 1 a). Addition of 50 nmRGS4 to the permeabilization medium inhibited about 85% of Ca2+ release triggered by carbachol (Fig. 1 b). Inhibition by RGS4 was fully reversible by addition of GTPγS (2.5 μm), a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog that activates Gα subunits, suggesting that inhibition of signaling reflects the GAP activity of RGS4 under these conditions. Consistent with this interpretation, RGS4 at concentrations up to 1.87 μm had no effect on Ca2+ release evoked by IP3 (Fig.1 e), which excludes the possibility that RGS4 inhibited the IP3-activated Ca2+ channel. An important finding shown in Fig. 1 is that RGS4 inhibited Ca2+ release stimulated by three different Gq-coupled receptors with markedly different potencies. Fig. 1 (b, d, ande) shows that, whereas 0.05 μm RGS4 inhibited 85% of Ca2+ release evoked by carbachol, 0.65 μm RGS4 only partially inhibited Ca2+ release and 1.87 μm RGS4 inhibited 85% of Ca2+release by CCK. The dependence of inhibition of Ca2+release on RGS4 concentration is illustrated in Fig.2. Half-maximal inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization induced by carbachol, bombesin, and CCK occurred at [RGS4] of approximately 35, 110, and 380 nm, respectively. Hence, cholinergic receptors were 3- and 10-fold more sensitive to RGS4 than were bombesin and CCK receptors. Addition of higher concentrations of any agonist did not alter the IC50of RGS4 (data not shown). The differential sensitivity of the Gq-coupled receptors to RGS4 inhibition was also reflected in activation of PLC and IP3 production in SLO-permeabilized cells. Fig.3 shows that the three agonists stimulated PLC activity to the same extent, indicating similar activation of Gq class α subunits by each agonist. Consistent with the concentration dependence of Ca2+signaling inhibition shown above, 50 nm and 0.2 μm RGS4 inhibited carbachol-stimulated IP3production by 60 ± 4% and 91 ± 7%, respectively. By contrast, 0.1 μm and 0.5 μm RGS4 was needed to inhibit bombesin-stimulated IP3 production by 41 ± 6% and 94 ± 7%, respectively. Finally, 0.4 μm and 2 μm RGS4 inhibited the effect of CCK on IP3production by 43 ± 7% and 77 ± 8%, respectively. Thus, RGS4 inhibition of both PLC activity and Ca2+ signaling were receptor-selective. The receptor-selective action of RGS4 might reflect preferential coupling of the receptors to different Gq class α subunits that respond differentially to RGS4. Alternatively, selectivity might be determined by receptor-specific interactions. We used mice genetically deficient in one or more of the Gq class α subunits that are expressed in pancreatic acinar cells (Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14) (Fig. 4 a; Ref. 6Xu X. Croy J.T. Zeng W. Zhao L.-P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27275-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to distinguish these possibilities. When Ca2+signaling was measured in intact acinar cells of homozygous knockout mice (Gαq−/−, Gα11−/−, and the double knockout lines Gα11−/−;Gα14−/− and Gαq−/−;Gα15−/−), maximal Ca2+ responses were identical in wild type and all mutant mice tested (6Xu X. Croy J.T. Zeng W. Zhao L.-P. Davignon I. Popov S. Yu K. Jiang H. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27275-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To evaluate the importance of the α subunit identity in conferring selectivity to RGS4 action, we compared the inhibition of Ca2+ signaling by RGS4 in permeabilized pancreatic acini from WT and Gq class knockout mice. Representative experiments are illustrated in Figs. 4 and5, and the results of all experiments are summarized in Table I. Fig. 4(b–e) shows the concentration of RGS4 needed to inhibit 50–60% of Ca2+ signaling evoked by each agonist in acini from WT mice. Fig. 5 (a–d, e–h, andi–l) show similar experiments for 50–60% inhibition of Ca2+ signaling by comparable concentrations of RGS4 in acini from the Gαq−/−;Gα15−/−, Gα11−/−, and Gα11−/−;Gα14−/− mice, respectively. The relative inhibitory potency of RGS4 was unaltered for each of the three agonists used here (Table I). The differential sensitivity to RGS4 among the different receptors was somewhat higher in mouse than in rat pancreas. In cells from WT mice, the response to carbachol was about 4.5- and 33-fold more sensitive to RGS4 than that of bombesin and CCK, respectively. Similar results were obtained in cells from Gα11−/−, Gα11−/−;Gα14−/−, and Gαq−/−;Gα15−/− mice. The findings in Table I and Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that interactions with receptor, rather than the identity of the G protein α subunit, dictate differential sensitivity to RGS4.Table IReceptor selectivity of RGS4 is unaltered in mice deficient in Gq class genesAgonistRelative inhibitory potency of RGS4 (agonist:carbachol ratio)aFold increase in RGS4 concentration in the incubation medium that is n"

Several substrates were phosphorylated. Rates with myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), myosin, and the 20-kDa myosin light chain were higher than other substrates. Thiophosphorylation of MYPT1 inhibited myosin phosphatase activity. Phosphorylation of myosin at serine 19 increased actin-activated Mg+-ATPase activity, i.e. similar to myosin light chain kinase. Myosin phosphorylation was increased at higher ionic strengths, possibly by formation of 6 S myosin. Phosphorylation of the isolated light chain and myosin phosphatase was decreased by increasing ionic strength. Rho-kinase was stimulated 1.5–2-fold by guanosine 5′-O-3-(thio)triphosphate·RhoA, whereas limited tryptic hydrolysis caused a 5–6-fold activation, independent of RhoA. Several kinase inhibitors were screened and most effective were Y-27632, staurosporine, and H-89. Several lipids caused slight activation of Rho-kinase, but arachidonic acid (30–50 μm) induced a 5–6-fold activation, independent of RhoA. These results suggest that Rho-kinase of smooth muscle may be involved in the contractile process via phosphorylation of MYPT1 and myosin.

However, the relationship between [Ca2+]i and myosin phosphorylation is not fixed and under certain conditions may shift. Increased phosphorylation at submaximal Ca2+ levels, referred to as increased Ca2+ sensitivity, frequently occurs following agonist stimulation (4Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). With respect to the balance of kinase and phosphatase activities, this effect could reflect either increased activity of the Ca2+·calmodulin·MLCK complex or, inhibition of myosin phosphatase (MP). The latter was found to be the case (5Kitazawa T. Masuo M. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9307-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 6Kubota Y. Nomura M. Kamm K.E.

Phosphorylation of MYPT1 by Rho-kinase inhibited MP and this was suggested as a mechanism to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity in smooth muscle (17Kimura K. Ito M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M.

In addition, it was found that bovine brain Rho-kinase could directly phosphorylate myosin in vitro (18Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol.

Indeed, introduction of the constitutively active recombinant fragment of bovine Rho-kinase into Triton X-100-permeabilized smooth muscle provoked a Ca2+-independent contraction via MLC20 phosphorylation (19Kureishi Y.

The isoforms are relatively large proteins (150–160 kDa) consisting of an amino-terminal kinase domain, a central coiled-coil domain that includes the Rho-binding domain, and a carboxyl-terminal putative pleckstrin homology domain separated by the insertion of a cysteine-rich zinc finger domain (11Leung T.

However, it is surprising that despite the numerous reports supporting a role for RhoA in smooth muscle there are no data available on the smooth muscle Rho-kinase. In the present study, we have purified the smooth muscle Rho-kinase from chicken gizzard. It is suggested that the gizzard Rho-kinase is the ROKα isoform. The biochemical properties of the smooth muscle Rho-kinase are outlined and its possible role(s) in smooth muscle function are discussed.

MP was prepared from chicken gizzard (31Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol.

Ito M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K.

A 1-ml column of antibody-Sepharose 4B was prepared (about 0.5 mg of antibody/ml of resin) and equilibrated with TBS. MP was applied and the column was washed with 5 ml of TBS then 10 ml of TBS plus 1 m MgCl2 (this step removed the endogenous kinase). Phosphatase was eluted with 10 ml of TBS, 4.5 m MgCl2, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, dialyzed versus 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% sucrose and stored at −20 °C. 10–20 g of frozen chicken gizzard was homogenized with 5 volumes (w/v) of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 μm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride and 0.25m sucrose) using a Waring blender and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was used as the crude nuclear fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to separate cytosol (supernatant) and membrane fraction (pellet). The crude membrane and nuclear fractions were solublized in buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were used as the membrane and nuclear fractions. These fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using a bovine Rho-kinase antibody. The content of Rho-kinase in each fraction was estimated by densitometry (Densitograph, Atto, Japan) using purified Rho-kinase from chicken gizzard as a standard. The sample loads for the fractions and standard were varied to obtain a linear response with the enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) detection procedure. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. 200 g of frozen chicken gizzard were homogenized with 5 volumes (w/v) of buffer A using a Waring blender and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was rehomogenized with the same volume of buffer A and centrifuged. The supernatants were combined and polyethylene glycol 6000 added to 6% (v/v). After 30 min, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min and dissolved in 200 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 μm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol) containing 0.1 m NaCl using a Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min and the supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (2.6 × 14 cm) equilibrated with buffer B plus 0.1 m NaCl. The column was washed extensively with buffer B plus 0.1 m NaCl and eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0.1–0.6 m) in buffer B. The fractions containing Rho-kinase activity were pooled and dialyzed against 5 liters of buffer C (10 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 μm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol) for 2 h. After brief centrifugation (10,000 × gfor 5 min) the sample was loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer C. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer C plus 0.15 m NaCl and Rho-kinase was eluted (at approximately 0.45 m NaCl) by application of a 180-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0.15–0.7m) in buffer C. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer D (10 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 μm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol). The dialyzed sample was applied to a 1-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B column immobilized with 5 mg of the “active” form of RhoA, i.e. GTPγS·GST-RhoA (12Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer D containing 0.5m NaCl. Rho-kinase was eluted in two steps: initially by elution at higher pH (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) and subsequently by elution with glutathione (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmglutathione, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). Unless otherwise indicated, Rho-kinase activity was assayed in a reaction mixture (final volume of 50 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm microcystin-LR, enzyme, and substrate as indicated. MLCK activity was assayed in a reaction mixture (final volume of 50 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 2 μg/ml calmodulin, 0.1 μg/ml MLCK, and MLC20 as indicated. Reactions were initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP to a final concentration of 100 μm. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min (enzyme concentration was adjusted to ensure linear kinetics at this time) 40-μl aliquots were removed and added to phosphocellulose paper. The paper was washed immediately for 10 min with 75 mmphosphoric acid (4 times), dried, and 32P incorporation determined by Cerenkov counting. Alternatively, reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5–20%), followed by autoradiography or 32P determination in excised gel slices. Phosphatase assays were carried out at 30 °C using 32P-labeled MLC20 (final concentration 5 μm) as substrate. Assay conditions were: 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.3 mm CoCl2(26Ichikawa K. Hirano K. Ito M. Tanaka J. Nakano T. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6313-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MP holoenzyme by Rho-kinase was carried out at 30 °C for different times in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 30 μg/ml MP, 2 μg/ml Rho-kinase, 2 μm GTPγS·GST-RhoA, and 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of 1 μm microcystin-LR in a final volume of 50 μl. The reactions were initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and immediately boiled for 3 min. These samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5–20%), followed by autoradiography or 32P determination in excised gel slices, positions corresponding to MYPT1, PP1cδ, or M20. To determine the effects of phosphorylation on MP activity, phosphorylation of MP was carried out under the similar conditions without microcystin-LR using ATPγS instead of ATP. At each time point, an aliquot was removed, diluted 100-fold with a buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm EDTA and assayed for phosphatase assay. Phosphorylation of the recombinant fragments of MYPT1 (30 μg/ml rG-MYPT1667–1004, 30 μg/ml rMYPT11–674, and 20 μg/ml GST) was carried out in the presence or absence of 2 μm GTPγS·GST-RhoA and in the absence of microcystin-LR under the above conditions. To determine the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of myosin, myosin (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 250 μm[γ-32P]ATP in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 μg/ml Rho-kinase, and 2 μmGTPγS·GST-RhoA, final volume 50 μl. After incubation for different times, reactions were terminated by addition of trichloroacetic acid and sodium pyrophosphate to 5 and 1%, respectively. The precipitated protein was collected and washed with the trichloroacetic acid/sodium pyrophosphate solution, using plastic funnels (Sepacol columns, Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a fiberglass disc and cotton plug (27Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32P incorporation was estimated by Cerenkov counting. Assays of actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin were as described previously (32Ikebe M. Barsotti R.J. Hinkins S. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5062-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Purified Rhokinase was subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a ProblotTM membrane (Applied Biosystems). The band corresponding to Rhokinase was digested by lysyl endopeptidase. The resulting peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and subjected to a gas-phase sequencer (Shimadzu PSQ-1, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (33Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Lipids were routinely prepared as chloroform, ethanol, or dimethyl sulfoxide stocks, and vesicles were prepared as described earlier (25Ito M. Feng J. Tujino S. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Tanaka J. Ichikawa K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7607-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For dimethyl sulfoxide stocks, lipids were directly diluted into the same buffer. SDS-PAGE was carried out with the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar).

Protein concentrations were determined with either the BCA (Pierce) or Bradford (Bio-Rad) procedures, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The distribution of Rho-kinase in various fractions from gizzard was investigated using the bovine Rho-kinase antibody. Most of the kinase was present in the cytosolic fraction (75.3 ± 3.3%; mean ± S.E., n = 3) compared with the membrane (20.4 ± 2.9%) and nuclear fractions (4.3 ± 1.0%). Gizzard cytosol was used as source for purification of Rho-kinase. The purification procedure was monitored by Western blots and also by assay with GTPγS·GST-RhoA and rG-MYPT1667–1004 as substrate. An efficient (high yield) method was developed for purification of Rho-kinase as outlined in Table I. The yield of Rho-kinase from 200 g of chicken gizzard was approximately 33 μg and this was purified over 20,000-fold to apparent homogeneity.Table IPurification of Rho-kinaseFractionVolumeProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmlmgnmol/minnmol/min/mgfold%Homogenate1826 ± 3610502 ± 65879.4 ± 11.70.0072 ± 0.001711006% Polyethylene glycol183 ± 161985 ± 15666 ± 400.0324 ± 0.00484.5 ± 0.283 ± 4Q-Sepharose FF122 ± 10223 ± 942 ± 280.23 ± 0.0330.8 ± 1.364 ± 5Phosphocellulose50.3 ± 1.518.6 ± 3.127 ± 211.38 ± 0.04208 ± 2440 ± 12RhoA affinity5.0 ± 0.50.033 ± 0.0044.1 ± 2.9140.5 ± 8.220508 ± 1865.6 ± 0.4Smooth muscle Rho-kinase was purified from 200 g of chicken gizzard.

Open table in a new tab Smooth muscle Rho-kinase was purified from 200 g of chicken gizzard. The kinase activity was assayed using 0.1 mg/ml rG-MYPT1667–1004 as substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values present means ± S.E. (n = 4). The initial step was precipitation with polyethylene glycol 6000 and this recovered about 80% of the cytosolic Rho-kinase. The elution profiles of the subsequent chromatography procedures are shown in Fig.1, A and B. These are reproducible and the kinase activity was closely correlated with the presence of immunoreactive bands on Western blots. The final step was affinity chromatography on GTPγS·GST-RhoA glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 1 C). Two elution steps were used. A step to pH 8.3 eluted a single band of apparent molecular mass 160 kDa (p160). This was identified as Rho-kinase by Western blots (Fig. 1 D). The purity of Rho-kinase was greater than 90%, as judged by SDS-PAGE, and this fraction was taken as the final product. A second elution step with 10 mm glutathione was applied. This removed components of 160 kDa (p160), a doublet at about 130 kDa (termed p130 in Fig.1 D) and GST-RhoA (Fig. 1 D). By Western blots (Fig. 1 D), p160 was identified as Rho-kinase and p130 was identified as the MYPT1 doublet (apparent masses 133 and 130 kDa (Ref.31Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The fraction eluted by 10 mm glutathione also contained the PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1cδ) and the small noncatalytic subunit of MP, M20 (data not shown). The co-purification of MP and Rho-kinase from the Rho affinity column suggested that both interacted with the active form of RhoA,i.e. GTPγS·GST-RhoA. To confirm this, a precipitation assay using GTPγS·GST-RhoA-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B and an overlay assay using [35S]GTPγS·GST-RhoA were carried out. These assays showed that Rho-kinase and MYPT1 interacted specifically with GTPγS·GST-RhoA, but interactions were not detected with either GDP·GST-RhoA nor GTPγS·GST-RhoAA37 (data not shown). These results are in agreement with our previous report (12Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K.

Vitamin A (retinol) is the substrate for the biosynthesis of several functional retinoids (retinol derivatives) which are essential for important biological processes such as, vision, reproduction, and development (for review, see Ref. 1Napoli J.L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopath. 1996; 80: S52-S62Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The small intestinal epithelium is the first site of interaction and processing of retinol after absorption from the diet. Within this epithelium, the final processing step involves the esterification of retinol with long chain fatty acids, primarily palmitic, and incorporation of the retinyl esters into the hydrophobic core of chylomicrons which are secreted into the lymph and ultimately enter the blood via the thoracic and other lymphatic ducts (2Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2. Academic Press, New York1984: 2-34Google Scholar). Chylomicron remnants are taken up by the liver and the retinyl esters are stored until needed. Following de-esterification by the liver, retinol is complexed with a 21-kDa retinol-binding protein (RBP) 1The abbreviations used are: CRBP, cellular retinol-binding protein; LRAT, lecithin retinol acyltransferase; RBA, all-trans-retinyl α-bromoacetate; BACMK, N-boc-l-biocytinyl-11-aminoundecane chloromethyl ketone; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; HEK-293, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; HEK-293T, human embryonic kidney 293T cells; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; bp base pair(s), UTR, untranslated region; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: CRBP, cellular retinol-binding protein; LRAT, lecithin retinol acyltransferase; RBA, all-trans-retinyl α-bromoacetate; BACMK, N-boc-l-biocytinyl-11-aminoundecane chloromethyl ketone; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; HEK-293, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; HEK-293T, human embryonic kidney 293T cells; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; bp base pair(s), UTR, untranslated region; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. and secreted into the circulation as a complex with transthyretin whereby it is distributed to other tissues (3Goodman D.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2. Academic Press, New York1984: 42-88Google Scholar). Both proteins are thought to transport and protect retinol from oxidation and/or isomerization during the distribution process. In the eye, and more specifically in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), this retinol complex interacts with the basal membrane of RPE cells probably via an RBP receptor (4Heller J. Bok D. Am. J.

All-trans-retinyl esters generated by the activity of LRAT are not only presumptive storage forms of vitamin A, but they are also substrates for an isomerohydrolase which transforms the esters into an intermediate 11-cis-retinol (12Bernstein P.S.

In the RPE, the esterification process of retinol by LRAT is critical for the continuation of the visual cycle since it supplies the processed substrate for the isomerization reaction. Although LRAT has been solubilized, partially purified and substantially studied with respect to its kinetic properties and substrate specificity (16Barry R.J. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. J. Biol.

One of these has been used as a probe to determine the putative mass of LRAT. Using [3H]all-trans-retinyl α-bromoacetate (RBA) which binds specifically to LRAT among partially purified proteins from bovine RPE, a product of about 25 kDa was labeled (20Shi Y.-Q. Furuyoshi S.

Because of the physiological relevance of LRAT, particularly in the metabolism and storage of vitamin A, its molecular characterization is of vital importance.In this study, we report on the biochemical properties of LRAT and the generation of specific polyclonal antibodies. Additionally, we describe its primary structure and verify its authenticity by the expression of LRAT in transformed mammalian cell lines.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we describe for the first time the deduced amino acid sequence of LRAT, an essential enzyme in the processing of vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) into 11-cis-retinoids in the RPE and for transport and processing of retinoids in other tissues. LRAT has been exceedingly difficult to purify to homogeneity and consequently its primary structure and molecular identification has been lacking. As is typical of many membrane-bound enzymes, enzyme denaturation occurs as purification proceeds. Therefore, indirect biochemical means were sought to clearly identify this important enzyme as an initial step toward its further molecular characterization.Affinity labeling experiments were performed by using the LRAT specific affinity labeling agent dodecylchloromethyl ketone coupled to biocytin (BACMK) to facilitate the localization of LRAT by ECL. Initial experiments showed that LRAT activity was clearly inhibited by BACMK in a concentration-dependent manner, operating in the similar concentration range found with the active site-directed affinity labeling agent RBA (20Shi Y.-Q. Furuyoshi S. Hubacek I. Rando R.R. Biochem. 1993; 32: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, BACMK displayed a time-dependent mode of inhibition, suggesting an irreversible inhibitory effect on LRAT due to covalent binding. This observation was supported by the fact that LRAT activity could not be restored after removing excess BACMK. Previously, radioactive RBA has been shown to label a protein with an apparent mass of 25 kDa (20Shi Y.-Q. Furuyoshi S. Hubacek I. Rando R.R. Biochem. 1993; 32: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In agreement with this report, ECL staining of the BACMK affinity labeled product also showed a 25-kDa protein as the labeled entity. The fact that the same polypeptide band was shown to be labeled by both BACMK and RBA affinity labeling agents provided stronger evidence that the LRAT protein was identified and has a mass of 25 kDa.Additional evidence for the identification of LRAT was supported by the sequence analysis of cDNA clones obtained from a human RPE cDNA library. Encompassing nucleotide sequences of the two major clones indicated an open reading frame of 690 bp encoding for a 230-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated mass of 25.3 kDa, in close agreement with the protein size obtained by the affinity labeling procedures. In addition, the sequences of both bovine N-terminal and internal peptide data from the biochemical characterization were present within the human LRAT polypeptide, confirming the correlation of both peptides with the deduced amino acid sequence from the cDNAs. Amino acid variations were seen particularly in the N-terminal peptide residues which are probably due to species differences since the peptide sequences were derived from bovine tissue. A hydropathy analysis (31Hofmann W. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar) of the LRAT amino acid sequence suggests 2 possible transmembrane regions within the protein at positions 9–31 and 195–222 (http://ulrec3.unil.ch/software/TMPRED). Thus, within the endoplasmic reticulum where the protein is presumed to be located, the N- and C-terminal would be found in the same lumenal (extracellular) orientation. It is therefore hypothesized that the active site for LRAT would be localized somewhere in the putative cytosolic loop formed by residues 31–195 which includes cysteine residues at position 161, 168, and 182.A nucleotide and amino acid comparison with sequences deposited in GenBank showed no homology with any previously described protein. Surprisingly, when LRAT was compared with sequences encoding for other closely related acyltransferases such as the 60-kDa soluble protein lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (32Francone O.L. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1716-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Lean J. Fielding D. Drayna D. Dieplinger H. Baer B. Kohr W. Henzel W. Lawn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2335-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) low homology was found and no obvious sequence to account for a possible common active site was identified. Although it is known that both acyltransferases remove acyl groups from lecithin to esterify their respective substrates, retinol for LRAT and cholesterol for lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, it is possible that each process occurs in a mechanistically different manner. In fact, LRAT has regiospecificity for acyl groups at position sn-1, whereas lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase possesses regiospecificity for acyl groups at position sn-2 of membrane phospholipids (11Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8636-8640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22MacDonald P.N. Ong D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7220-7226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Northern blot analysis suggested a major 5.0-kb mRNA for LRAT. The overlapping sequences of the two major cDNA clones contain 2718 bp of this message. The nucleotide sequence required to encompass the remainder of the 5.0-kb message remains to be resolved. The existence of alternative polyadenylation sites in the 3′-UTR or in the initiation of transcription sites at the 5′-UTR could account for the variation in the size of the observed species in the Northern blots. Our current analysis of genomic clones for the gene characterization of LRAT will eventually help to elucidate these issues. Interestingly, Fig. 4 also shows an apparent higher level of expression of LRAT RNA transcripts in adult tissues compared with fetal stages. If the levels of mRNA in these tissues have a direct correlation with higher protein synthesis and therefore higher enzymatic activity, it is possible that an increased demand for esterification is required at the adult stage of development.In summary, evidence that the deduced amino acid sequence corresponds to LRAT is provided by several techniques. Western blot detection of a 25-kDa protein in native RPE cells and LRAT-transfected cells is in agreement with data obtained by affinity labeling of the protein. The ability of HEK-293 cells transfected with LRAT cDNA to convert retinol into retinyl palmitate (Figs. 6 and 7) provides additional compelling evidence. Although it is known that, physiologically, LRAT uses as a substrate retinol bound to CRBP for the formation of retinyl esters, our experiments were performed using retinol bound to BSA, a method whose efficacy has been well established in earlier studies (12Bernstein P.S. Law W.C. Rando R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1849-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,13Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Canada F.J. Rando R.R.

Chemical proof on the identification of all-trans-retinyl esters by the LRAT-transfected cells comes from chemical transformation. The expected retinyl ester stereoisomers were generated by I2 isomerization of the major elution product. Combined, these data strongly suggest that the observed activity is due to LRAT. Moreover, the antibodies will serve as useful reagents for the subcellular localization of this protein by immunohistochemistry in multiple tissues and offer the opportunity for co-precipitation of associated components such as the isomerohydrolase which acts downstream of retinyl ester synthesis. Vitamin A (retinol) is the substrate for the biosynthesis of several functional retinoids (retinol derivatives) which are essential for important biological processes such as, vision, reproduction, and development (for review, see Ref. 1Napoli J.L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopath. 1996; 80: S52-S62Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The small intestinal epithelium is the first site of interaction and processing of retinol after absorption from the diet. Within this epithelium, the final processing step involves the esterification of retinol with long chain fatty acids, primarily palmitic, and incorporation of the retinyl esters into the hydrophobic core of chylomicrons which are secreted into the lymph and ultimately enter the blood via the thoracic and other lymphatic ducts (2Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2. Academic Press, New York1984: 2-34Google Scholar). Chylomicron remnants are taken up by the liver and the retinyl esters are stored until needed. Following de-esterification by the liver, retinol is complexed with a 21-kDa retinol-binding protein (RBP) 1The abbreviations used are: CRBP, cellular retinol-binding protein; LRAT, lecithin retinol acyltransferase; RBA, all-trans-retinyl α-bromoacetate; BACMK, N-boc-l-biocytinyl-11-aminoundecane chloromethyl ketone; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; HEK-293, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; HEK-293T, human embryonic kidney 293T cells; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; bp base pair(s), UTR, untranslated region; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: CRBP, cellular retinol-binding protein; LRAT, lecithin retinol acyltransferase; RBA, all-trans-retinyl α-bromoacetate; BACMK, N-boc-l-biocytinyl-11-aminoundecane chloromethyl ketone; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; HEK-293, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; HEK-293T, human embryonic kidney 293T cells; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; bp base pair(s), UTR, untranslated region; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. and secreted into the circulation as a complex with transthyretin whereby it is distributed to other tissues (3Goodman D.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2. Academic Press, New York1984: 42-88Google Scholar). Both proteins are thought to transport and protect retinol from oxidation and/or isomerization during the distribution process. In the eye, and more specifically in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), this retinol complex interacts with the basal membrane of RPE cells probably via an RBP receptor (4Heller J. Bok D. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1976; 81: 93-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Sundaram M. Sivaprasadarao A. DeSousa M.M. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3336-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), where retinol is delivered into the cytoplasm to initiate a unique and highly specialized process for the RPE, the visual cycle (for review, see Refs. 6Ross A.C.

During this important process, the retinol bound to a cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP), is trans-esterified by an enzyme named lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) (9MacDonald P.N. Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12478-12482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8636-8640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that transfers an acyl group from lecithin to retinol to generate all-trans-retinyl esters. All-trans-retinyl esters generated by the activity of LRAT are not only presumptive storage forms of vitamin A, but they are also substrates for an isomerohydrolase which transforms the esters into an intermediate 11-cis-retinol (12Bernstein P.S. Law W.C. Rando R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1849-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Due to a membrane-associated alcohol dehydrogenase (14Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt D. Eriksson U. J. Biol.

Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 1988-1996PubMed Google Scholar), 11-cis-retinol is then oxidized and converted into 11-cis-retinaldehyde which is the chromophore for rhodopsin and the cone photopigments. In the RPE, the esterification process of retinol by LRAT is critical for the continuation of the visual cycle since it supplies the processed substrate for the isomerization reaction. Although LRAT has been solubilized, partially purified and substantially studied with respect to its kinetic properties and substrate specificity (16Barry R.J. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9231-9238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shi Y.-Q. Hubacek I. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1257-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it has never been characterized at the molecular level. An ordered ping-pong bi-bi mechanism in which lecithin first acylates the enzyme describes the kinetic mechanism of action of LRAT (17Shi Y.-Q. Hubacek I. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1257-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The effects of potent competitive reversible and irreversible specific inhibitors for its enzymatic activity have been described (18Fulton B.S. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7938-7945Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Trehan A. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Biochem. 1990; 29: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). One of these has been used as a probe to determine the putative mass of LRAT. Using [3H]all-trans-retinyl α-bromoacetate (RBA) which binds specifically to LRAT among partially purified proteins from bovine RPE, a product of about 25 kDa was labeled (20Shi Y.-Q. Furuyoshi S. Hubacek I. Rando R.R. Biochem. 1993; 32: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, while using radiation inactivation analysis on intact microsomal membranes from rat liver the activity of LRAT yielded a target size averaging 52–56 kDa (21Ross C.A. Kempner E.S. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to RPE and liver, LRAT activity has also been reported in several other tissues such as, testis, intestine, and pancreas (11Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8636-8640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22MacDonald P.N. Ong D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

If the levels of mRNA in these tissues have a direct correlation with higher protein synthesis and therefore higher enzymatic activity, it is possible that an increased demand for esterification is required at the adult stage of development. In summary, evidence that the deduced amino acid sequence corresponds to LRAT is provided by several techniques. Western blot detection of a 25-kDa protein in native RPE cells and LRAT-transfected cells is in agreement with data obtained by affinity labeling of the protein. The ability of HEK-293 cells transfected with LRAT cDNA to convert retinol into retinyl palmitate (Figs. 6 and 7) provides additional compelling evidence. Although it is known that, physiologically, LRAT uses as a substrate retinol bound to CRBP for the formation of retinyl esters, our experiments were performed using retinol bound to BSA, a method whose efficacy has been well established in earlier studies (12Bernstein P.S. Law W.C. Rando R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1849-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,13Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Canada F.J. Rando R.R.

Chemical proof on the identification of all-trans-retinyl esters by the LRAT-transfected cells comes from chemical transformation. The expected retinyl ester stereoisomers were generated by I2 isomerization of the major elution product. Combined, these data strongly suggest that the observed activity is due to LRAT. Moreover, the antibodies will serve as useful reagents for the subcellular localization of this protein by immunohistochemistry in multiple tissues and offer the opportunity for co-precipitation of associated components such as the isomerohydrolase which acts downstream of retinyl ester synthesis.

The sequence at the carboxyl terminus of B-type ephrins contains a putative PDZ binding site, providing a possible mechanism through which transmembrane ephrins might interact with cytoplasmic proteins. To test this notion, a day 10.5 mouse embryonic expression library was screened with a biotinylated peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of ephrin B3. Three of the positive cDNAs encoded polypeptides with multiple PDZ domains, representing fragments of the molecule GRIP, the protein syntenin, and PHIP, a novel PDZ domain-containing protein related toCaenorhabditis elegans PAR-3. In addition, the binding specificities of PDZ domains previously predicted by an oriented library approach (Songyang, Z., Fanning, A. S., Fu, C., Xu, J., Marfatia, S. M., Chishti, A. H., Crompton, A., Chan, A. C., Anderson, J. M., and Cantley, L. C. (1997)Science 275, 73–77) identified the tyrosine phosphatase FAP-1 as a potential binding partner for B ephrins. In vitro studies demonstrated that the fifth PDZ domain of FAP-1 and full-length syntenin bound ephrin B1 via the carboxyl-terminal motif. Lastly, syntenin and ephrin B1 could be co-immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-1 cells, suggesting that PDZ domain binding of B ephrins can occur in cells. These results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal motif of B ephrins provides a binding site for specific PDZ domain-containing proteins, which might localize the transmembrane ligands for interactions with Eph receptors or participate in signaling within ephrin B-expressing cells.

Among the large number of receptor tyrosine kinases identified in metazoan organisms, the members of the Eph family are unusual in several respects. Although only one Eph receptor tyrosine kinase is known to be encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans genome (the vab-1 gene product (2George S.E. Simokat K. Hardin J. Chisolm A.D. Cell. 1998; 92: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)), vertebrates typically possess up to 14 genes for Eph receptors, suggesting that these tyrosine kinases may be important in controlling complex cellular interactions (3Drescher U.

Consistent with this possibility, C. elegans VAB-1 regulates morphogenetic cell movements during ventral closure in the embryo (2George S.E. Simokat K. Hardin J. Chisolm A.D. Cell. 1998; 92: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) while vertebrate Eph receptors have been implicated in controlling axon guidance and fasciculation, in specifying topographic map formation within the central nervous system, in organizing the movements of neural crest cells during development, in directing fusion of epithelial sheets in closure of the palate, and in angiogenesis (5Henkemeyer M.

Cell. 1998; 93: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Early work on the expression patterns of EphB2 (formerly Nuk) suggested that this receptor is clustered at sites of cell-cell junctions in the developing mouse midbrain and raised the possibility that Eph receptors might mediate signals initiated by direct cell-cell interactions (5Henkemeyer M. Marengere L.E.M. McGlade J. Olivier J.P. Conlon R.A. Holmyard D.P. Letwin K. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1001-1014PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the notion that Eph receptors are normally activated by ligands that are physically associated with the surface of an adjacent cell. All known ligands for the Eph receptors (termed ephrins) are related in sequence but can be divided into two groups based on their carboxyl-terminal motifs. The ephrin A class of ligands become modified by a carboxyl-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety, through which the ligand is anchored to the surface of the ligand-expressing cell (7Drescher U. Kremoser C. Handwerker C. Loschinger J. Noda M. Bonhoeffer F. Cell. 1995; 82: 359-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 9Winslow J.W. Moran P. Valverde J. Shih A. Yuan J.Q.

Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In contrast, B-type ephrins possess a transmembrane element and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail comprised of 82–88 carboxyl-terminal residues (17Beckmann M.P. Cerretti D.P. Baum P. Vanden Bos T.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1343-1352PubMed Google Scholar). The Eph receptors can, in turn, be divided into A and B subgroups based on their sequence similarity and their propensity to bind soluble forms of either A or B type ephrins, respectively (4Eph Nomenclature Committee Cell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar,23Gale N.W.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3116-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, although soluble ephrins bind tightly to the relevant receptors, consistent activation of Eph tyrosine kinase activity requires either that the ligands be artificially clustered into oligomers or that receptor-expressing cells be co-cultured with cells expressing membrane-associated ephrins (18Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the ability of ephrins to aggregate and thereby activate Eph receptors depends on their attachment to the cell surface, consistent with the view that Eph receptor signaling involves cell-cell interactions. During embryonic development in the mouse, Eph receptors and their ligands are expressed in dynamic but complementary patterns, indicating that Eph receptors are likely activated at boundaries where Eph and ephrin-expressing cells are directly juxtaposed to one another (23Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E. Henkemeyer M. Strebhardt K. Hirai H. Wilkinson D.G. Pawson T. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D.

Biol. 1996; 179: 382-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of Eph receptor function in C. elegans and the mouse has indicated that Eph receptors have both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent modes of signaling and raised the possibility that B-type Eph receptors and ephrins might mediate bidirectional cell-to-cell signaling (2George S.E. Simokat K. Hardin J. Chisolm A.D. Cell. 1998; 92: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Henkemeyer M. Orioli D. Henderson J.T. Saxton T.M. Roder J. Pawson T. Klein R. Cell. 1996; 86: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Of interest, the binding of Eph receptors to transmembrane ephrin B1 or ephrin B2, as well as treatment of ephrin B-expressing cells with platelet-derived growth factor, leads to the phosphorylation of the ephrins on tyrosine residues within their highly conserved cytoplasmic tails (26Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Mbamalu G. Yancopoulos G.D. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 27Bruckner K. Pasquale E.B. Klein R. Science. 1997; 275: 1640-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the cytoplasmic tail of a Xenopusephrin B molecule leads to a striking loss of cell adhesion inXenopus embryos, an effect that is suppressed by treatment with fibroblast growth factor (28Jones T.L. Chong L.D. Kim J. Xu R.H. Kung H.F. Daar I.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results have suggested that the cytoplasmic tails of ephrin B molecules may interact with cellular proteins. Such ephrin B-interacting proteins could be important either in localizing the ligands to appropriate sites in the cell, for binding and activation of Eph receptors on adjacent cells, or in transmitting a signal within the ligand-expressing cell. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the ephrin B tail might then modulate the binding of such proteins in a positive or negative fashion. Inspection of the sequences of the ephrin B proteins has revealed a motif at the extreme carboxyl terminus (Tyr-Tyr-Lys-Val) that contains potential sites of phosphorylation and has features characteristic of binding sites for PDZ 1The abbreviations used are: PDZ, PSD95/Dlg, ZO-1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FAP, Fas-associated phosphatase.1The abbreviations used are: PDZ, PSD95/Dlg, ZO-1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FAP, Fas-associated phosphatase. domains. We have therefore screened for known or novel polypeptides that might interact with ephrin B ligands through this carboxyl-terminal motif. Here we report the identification of such ephrin B-interacting proteins. The B ephrin carboxyl-terminal peptide probe of sequence biotin-Aca-GPPQSPPNIpYYKV, related peptides NIpYpYKV, NIpYYKV, NIYpYKV, NIYYKV, and DHQpYpYND were synthesized as described previously (29van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A λEXlox 10.5 day mouse embryo expression library (Novagen) was plated at an initial density of 10,000 plaque-forming units/15-cm Petri plate. Library screening was performed using a biotinylated peptide probe conjugated to streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase following a procedure similar to that described by Sparks et al. (30Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To isolate more coding sequence for PHIP, an EcoRI/PstI fragment of PHIP cDNA (encoding amino acid residues 462–602) was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used to screen the λEXlox 10.5 day mouse embryo library. The DNA sequencing of positive clones was carried out using the ALF automated DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-ligand antibodies (Santa Cruz) were raised against residues 329–346 of ephrin B1. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. The expression construct of ephrin B1 cDNA in vector pJFE14 has been described (18Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Full-length syntenin cDNA was subcloned in frame into the mammalian expression vector pFLAG CMV2 (Kodak) using standard cloning procedures. For GST fusion constructs, cDNA sequences of syntenin (full-length: residues 1–299; PDZ 1 + 2: residues 101–299; PDZ1: residues 101–211; PDZ2: residues 172–299) were cloned into pGEX4T2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). FAP-1 (Fas-associated phosphatase) PDZ3 and FAP-1 PDZ5 constructs have been described (1Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The ephrin B1 Val deletion mutation was constructed by the removal of nucleotides coding for the carboxyl-terminal Val-346 using a polymerase chain reaction-mediated protocol. ThePpuMI/EcoRI polymerase chain reaction fragment carrying the mutated region was subcloned into the full-length ephrin B1 cDNA in pJFE14. This mutation and all fusion constructs were confirmed by sequencing of both strands of the affected region. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectin reagent and Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) as outlined by the manufacturer. To reduce phosphorylation of ephrin B1 by binding to endogenously expressed EphB receptors or by stimulation with serum growth factors, transfected cells were transferred from 10-cm to 15-cm plates 24 h after transfection and serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% fetal bovine serum 12 h prior to cell lysis. Transfected cells were rinsed once in phosphate-buffered saline A and lysed in phospholipase C lysis buffer (5Henkemeyer M. Marengere L.E.M. McGlade J. Olivier J.P. Conlon R.A. Holmyard D.P.

Immunoprecipitations were performed for 1 h at 4 °C using 1 μg of anti-ephrin B1 antibody or 1 μg of anti-interleukin 3 receptor α antibody with protein A-Sepharose. GST mixing experiments were carried out by 1-h incubation at 4 °C of lysate with 5–10 μg of fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. For the peptide competition experiments, peptides were included in the incubation with the GST fusion proteins at a final concentration of 100 μm. Beads for both immunoprecipitations and GST mixing experiments were washed 2–3 times in HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm mm NaCl) (5Henkemeyer M. Marengere L.E.M. McGlade J. Olivier J.P. Conlon R.A. Holmyard D.P. Letwin K. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1001-1014PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody. Blots were developed by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Pierce). Binding constant determination and peptide competition studies were carried out using fluorescence polarization on a Beacon 2000 Fluorescence Polarization System (Pan Vera, WI) equipped with a 100-μl sample chamber. Fluorescein-labeled probes were prepared through reaction of B ephrin carboxyl-terminal peptides with 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The authenticity of the fluorescein-labeled peptides was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. In the binding studies, the fluorescein-labeled peptide probe was dissolved in 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol to a concentration of 25 nmand a known quantity of GST fusion protein was added. The reaction mixtures were allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature prior to each measurement. All fluorescence polarization measurements were conducted at 22 °C. As one approach toward identifying proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic tails of B-type ephrins, we initially examined the carboxyl-terminal regions of the transmembrane ephrins for conserved peptide motifs that might bind modular domains of intracellular signaling proteins. The extreme carboxyl terminus of the three known B ephrins has a conserved sequence reminiscent of known or predicted binding sites for PDZ domains (Fig.1). We employed two strategies to identify PDZ domain-containing proteins with the potential to recognize the B ephrins. Firstly, comparison of the known binding specificities of PDZ domains, predicted through the use of an oriented peptide library technique, revealed the fifth PDZ domain of the cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase FAP-1 as a possible ephrin B binding partner (Fig.2 A). FAP-1 (also known as PTP-bas and PTP-L1) has at least six PDZ domains, an element related to the Band 4.1 cytoskeletal polypeptide, and a carboxyl-terminal tyrosine phosphatase domain (31Saras J. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Gonez L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24082-24089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Maekawa K. Imagawa N. Nagamatsu M. Harada S.

The fifth PDZ domain binds in vitro to peptides with the consensus E(I/Y/V)Y(Y/K)(V/K/I), which closely matches the conserved carboxyl terminus of B-type ephrins (YYKV) (1Songyang Z. Fanning A.S.

Although this peptide contained a phosphotyrosine residue at the −3 position relative to the carboxyl-terminal valine, we anticipated that the alkaline phosphatase used in the screen would at least partially dephosphorylate the probe, allowing detection of both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and independent binding. The screening of approximately 500,000 cDNA clones yielded four distinct cDNA products that bound to the ephrin B3 carboxyl-terminal peptide, of which 3 were subsequently found to contain PDZ domains upon sequence analysis (Fig. 2, B andC). One of these cDNAs encodes a portion of the adaptor protein GRIP, from the sixth PDZ domain to the carboxyl terminus (amino acid residues 642–1112). GRIP is an ∼180-kDa protein composed of seven PDZ domains, originally identified by its ability to bind the carboxyl terminus of AMPA receptors through PDZ domains 4 and 5 (34Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). A second cDNA isolated by this approach contained the entire coding sequence for the PDZ domain-containing protein syntenin. Syntenin was first reported as a transcript down-regulated during melanoma differentiation (termed Mda-9) and subsequently shown to interact via its two PDZ domains with the carboxyl terminus of the transmembrane syndecan proteins (35Lin J.J. Jiang H. Fisher P.B. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1996; 4: 317-333Google Scholar, 36Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A third clone identified in this screen was a partial cDNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal fragment of a novel PDZ domain-containing protein (termed PHIP for ephrininteracting protein). Analysis of the sequence of the PHIP cDNA fragment revealed the presence of two adjacent PDZ domains followed by a 50-amino acid carboxyl-terminal stretch. The PHIP cDNA fragment was subsequently used as a probe to isolate a transcript from a day 10.5 mouse embryo library. The predicted sequence of PHIP indicates that it encodes a total of three PDZ domains and is closely related to PAR-3, a C. elegans protein involved in regulating polarity of the early embryo (Fig. 2 D) (37Etemad-Moghadam B. Guo S. Kemphues K.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Of these candidates, FAP-1 PDZ5 and syntenin were further investigated for their binding to B ephrins. To determine whether either syntenin or FAP-1 could interact with ephrin B1 in vitro, GST fusions containing the fifth PDZ domain of FAP-1 or full-length syntenin were incubated with lysates of ephrin B1-transfected COS-1 cells. Recovery of these immobilized GST fusion proteins and immunoblotting of associated proteins with anti-ephrin B1 antibody revealed that both FAP-1 PDZ5 and full-length syntenin were able to bind intact ephrin B1 (Fig. 3,A and C). The region of syntenin required for binding to ephrin B1 was mapped using GST fusions containing defined fragments of the syntenin protein. The minimal sequence necessary for a strong interaction included both PDZ domains of syntenin but not the amino-terminal third of the protein (Fig. 3 D). Interestingly, both PDZ domains of syntenin are also required for binding to the carboxyl-terminal sequence of syndecans, suggesting that the involvement of two PDZ domains in the binding of a single target site may be a common feature of syntenin interactions (36Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). While the syntenin PDZ1 domain alone was unable to associate with ephrin B1, the second PDZ domain of syntenin alone exhibited a very weak interaction. In these experiments, neither GST alone nor a GST fusion with the third FAP-1 PDZ domain showed detectable binding to ephrin B1. The identity of the ∼50-kDa band recognized by GST-FAP-1 PDZ3 is not known but its apparent size does not correlate with any of the three known B ephrins. Consistent with this finding, the binding specificity of FAP-1 PDZ3, as previously determined using an oriented peptide library, is significantly different from that of FAP-1 PDZ5 with a preference toward target sequences such as the QSLV-COOH motif in the Fas antigen (1Songyang Z.

The L45 sequence of the TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I) specifies Smad2 interaction, whereas the related L45 sequence of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor (BMPR-I) specifies Smad1 interactions. Here we report that members of a third receptor group, which includes ALK1 and ALK2 from vertebrates and Saxophone from Drosophila, specifically phosphorylate and activate Smad1 even though the L45 sequence of this group is very divergent from that of BMPR-I. We investigated the structural elements that determine the specific recognition of Smad1 by ALK1 and ALK2. In addition to the receptor L45 loop and the Smad1 L3 loop, the specificity of this recognition requires the α-helix 1 of Smad1. The α-helix 1 is a conserved structural element located in the vicinity of the L3 loop on the surface of the Smad MH2 domain. Thus, Smad1 recognizes two distinct groups of receptors, the BMPR-I group and the ALK1 group, through different L45 sequences on the receptor kinase domain and a differential use of two surface structures on the Smad1 MH2 domain. Two structural elements, the L45 loop on the kinase domain of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family type I receptors and the L3 loop on the MH2 domain of Smad proteins, determine the specificity of the interactions between these receptors and Smad proteins.

Thus, Smad1 recognizes two distinct groups of receptors, the BMPR-I group and the ALK1 group, through different L45 sequences on the receptor kinase domain and a differential use of two surface structures on the Smad1 MH2 domain. The Smad family of proteins play a central role in signal transduction by the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein. family (1Attisano L.

Smad proteins are directly phosphorylated by type I TGF-β family receptors, an event that induces their accumulation in the nucleus where they activate transcription of specific genes. Smad proteins act as signal transducers for different members of the TGF-β family, including TGF-β itself, the activins, and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). The type I receptors for TGF-β and activin, which are known as TβR-I and ActR-IB, respectively, signal via Smad2 and its close homolog Smad3. The BMP type I receptors BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB signal via Smad1 and possibly its close homologs, Smad5 and Smad8. Upon receptor-mediated phosphorylation, and on their way to the nucleus, all these Smad proteins associate with Smad4, a member of a separate subclass that is required for the formation of transcriptional complexes. The Drosophila orthologs of BMP (Dpp), BMPR-I (Thickveins), Smad1 (Mad), and Smad4 (Medea) are functionally linked in a similar fashion (4Das P. Maduzia L. Wang H. Finelli A. Cho S.H. Smith M.

Development. 1998; 125: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maintenance of specificity in this system requires that each member of the type I receptor family be able to discriminate among different groups of Smad proteins. The specific interaction between Smad proteins and type I receptors is determined by two structural elements, namely, the L3 loop in the carboxyl-terminal domain (or MH2 domain) of Smad proteins and the L45 loop in the kinase domain of the receptors (7Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y.G. Pavletich N. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Both elements consist of a short amino acid sequence that is highly conserved among Smad proteins or receptors of similar specificity but differs on a few critical residues between functionally distinct Smad proteins or receptors. Thus, the L45 loop sequence of the TβR-I/ActR-IB group (which also includes the orphan receptors ALK7, XTrR-I and Atr-I) is compatible with the L3 loop sequence common to Smad2 and -3, allowing functional interactions between these receptors and Smad proteins. A similar relationship exists between the L45 loop of the BMPR-I group (which also includes Thickveins) and the L3 loop of Smad1, -5, -8, and Mad (see Figs. 1 A and 4 A for L45 and L3 sequences).Figure 4A, α-helix 1 and L3 sequences of receptor-regulated Smad proteins. Structural elements (arrows, β-strands; rounded boxes, α-helices) correspond to the Smad4 MH2 domain (40Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P.

This group includes ALK1, ALK2, and Drosophila Saxophone. Saxophone is essential for dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo and is believed to mediate Dpp signals along with Thickveins (9Brummel T.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by epithelial vascular dysplasia with a high propensity to hemorrhage in the nasal and gastrointestinal mucosa. ALK2 (also known as ActR-I or Tsk7L) is a broadly expressed receptor that can bind BMPs, activin, and, under certain conditions, TGF-β in vitro (1Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin.

Development. 1997; 124: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is akin to that of BMPR-I (22Graff J.M. Bansal A. Melton D.A.

Biol. 1997; 184: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), because both receptors signal ventral mesoderm induction, and defects in ventral mesoderm formation caused by a dominant-negative ALK2 construct can be rescued by overexpression of Smad8 (24Chen Y. Bhushan A. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12938-12943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the Smad specificity of this third group of type I receptors. We were intrigued by the fact that the L45 sequence of these receptors is very different from that of the TβR-I group or the BMPR-I group (see Fig. 1 A). Nonetheless, we observed that ALK1 and ALK2, like BMPR-I, recognize and activate Smad1. This was paradoxical because TβR-I, whose L45 sequence is much closer to that of BMPR-I, does not recognize Smad1. Insights from the crystal structure of the Smad MH2 domain allowed us to address this paradox. R1B/L17, COS-1, and HepG2 cells were maintained as described previously (8Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 25Chen Y.G. Liu F. Massagué J.

Mouse embryonic P19 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glucose. Mutagenesis of Smad proteins and receptors was performed by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate oligonucleotides, and verified by DNA sequencing. TβR-I(LA) contains a replacement of the L45 sequence ADNKDNGTW with the sequence SDMTSRHSS. Smad2(H1-1) contains the mutations A323S, V325I, and M327N, and Smad2(HL1) contains the mutations A323S, V325I, M327N, R427H, and T430D. Other constructs have been reported previously (7Lo R.S.

Luciferase activity was measured 40 h after transfection. Metabolic labeling of transfected cells with [32P]orthophosphate or [35S]Met/Cys was performed as described previously (8Chen Y.G. Hata A.

Immunoprecipitates with monoclonal anti-Flag M2 antibody (IBI, East Kodak) were visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Subcellular localization of Smad proteins was examined in HepG2 cells transfected with N-terminally Flag-tagged Smad proteins and the constitutively active receptors. Immunofluorescence was carried out as described previously (8Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J.

The percentage of Flag-positive cells with predominantly or exclusively nuclear immunofluorescence is plotted in the figures. To investigate the signaling specificity of human ALK1 and ALK2, we used transcriptional assays that discriminate between BMP-like signaling and TGF-β/activin-like signaling. Since the natural ligands for ALK1 and ALK2 have not been conclusively defined, we generated ALK1 and ALK2 mutant constructs [ALK1(QD) and ALK2(QD)] containing a Gln to Asp mutation in the penultimate residue of the regulatory domain (GS domain), which activates type I receptors in a ligand-independent manner (28Wieser R.

The corresponding mutant forms of the BMP type I receptors, BMPR-IA(QD) and BMPR-IB(QD), activate luciferase expression when cotransfected with the XVent2-Luc reporter construct into mouse P19 cells (Fig. 1 B). XVent2-Luc contains a BMP-responsive region from the Xenopus Vent.2 gene driving expression of luciferase (27Candia A.F. Watabe T. Hawley S.H. Onichtchouck D. Zhang Y. Derynck R. Niehrs C. Cho K.W. Development. 1997; 124: 4467-4480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can be activated via Smad1 but not Smad2 (8Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). ALK1(QD) and ALK2(QD) were also able to activate XVent2-Luc, whereas the constitutively active TGF-β receptor construct, TβR-I(TD), had no effect (Fig.1 B). We did similar experiments using two TGF-β/activin-responsive reporters, 3TP-Lux and A3-Luc. 3TP-lux contains TGF-β/activin-response elements from plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and collagenase (20Cárcamo J.

Both reporters were activated by the TGF-β receptor mutant TβR-I(TD) and the activin receptor mutant ActR-IB(TD) in transfected R1B/L17 mink lung cells (Fig. 1, C and D). ALK1(QD) and ALK2(QD), like BMPR-IB(QD), failed to activate 3TP-lux and A3-Luc (Fig. 1,C and D). Thus, the activation pattern of these three reporter constructs suggests that the signaling specificity of ALK1 and ALK2 is similar to that of the BMP type I receptors BMPR-IA and IB. These results raised the possibility that ALK1 and ALK2 may be able to phosphorylate and activate Smad1 but not Smad2. To investigate this possibility, receptor constructs were cotransfected with N-terminally Flag-tagged Smad1 or Smad2 into R1B/L17 cells, and Smad phosphorylation was determined by anti-Flag immunoprecipitation from the [32P]orthophosphate-labeled transfectants. The basal phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad2 observed in the absence of receptor activity in these cells (Fig.2 A, left lanes) is caused by MAP kinases acting on phosphorylation sites unrelated to the receptor-mediated phosphorylation sites (37Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). 3M. Kretzschmar, J. Doody, and J. Massagué, unpublished work. ALK1(QD) and ALK2(QD) increased the phosphorylation of Smad1 but not that of Smad2, which is similar to the effect of BMPR-IB(QD) and opposite to the effect of TβR-I(TD) (Fig. 2 A). These results were consistent with ALK1 and ALK2 acting as specific activators of Smad1 but not Smad2. To confirm that ALK1(QD) or ALK2(QD) specifically activated Smad1, we determined the ability of these constructs to induce nuclear accumulation of Smad proteins. Consistent with the above results, expression of ALK1(QD) or ALK2(QD) induced nuclear accumulation of Flag-Smad1 but not Flag-Smad2, which again is similar to the effect of BMPR-IB(QD) and opposite the effect of TβR-I(TD) (Fig.2 B). Under these conditions, nuclear localization of Flag-Smad proteins was observed in only a fraction of the cells. The incompleteness of this response may be because of limitations in the ability of the receptors to quantitatively activate the overexpressed Smad proteins. In untransfected cells, TGF-β induces a quantitative translocation of endogenous Smad2 and -3 into the nucleus.3 We repeated these assays using a Smad1 construct [Smad1(AAVA)] that contains three Ser to Ala mutations in the C-terminal sequence SSVS (38Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). These serines are the sites phosphorylated by BMPR-I, and their mutation to alanine prevents receptor-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Smad1 by BMP (38Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The Smad1(AAVA) mutant failed to accumulate in the nucleus when cotransfected with ALK1(QD) or ALK2(QD) vectors (data not shown). Therefore, ALK1 and ALK2 can mimic the ability of BMP type I receptors to specifically phosphorylate and activate Smad1, leading to BMP-like transcriptional responses. The sequence of the L45 loop in the kinase domain of TβR-I determines TGF-β signaling activity (39Feng X.H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the L45 loop of TβR-I and BMPR-I specifies the choice of Smad proteins by these receptors in the cell (8Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Five of nine residues in this sequence are conserved between TβR-I and BMPR-I (see Fig. 1 A). Thus, the three nonconserved residues are responsible for the different Smad specificity of these two receptors. Mutant TβR-I and BMPR-I constructs with these residues swapped show a switch in their ability to recognize and activate Smad1 and Smad2 (8Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The L45 loop is conserved between ALK1 and ALK2 but is very divergent between these receptors and TβR-I or BMPR-I (see Fig. 1 A). Because the Smad specificity of ALK1 and ALK2 is similar to that of BMPR-I receptors, we investigated whether this specificity is determined by the L45 sequence of ALK1 and ALK2 despite their lack of similarity to the BMPR-I L45 sequence. To this end, we generated a mutant TβR-I [TβR-I(LA)] containing the L45 sequence SDMTSRHSS, which corresponds to the ALK2 L45 sequence. The signaling specificity of this construct was compared with those of the wild type TβR-I and the previously described mutant TβR-I(LB) containing the L45 sequence of BMPR-I (8Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). TβR-I(LA) was similar to TβR-I(LB) and BMPR-I in its ability to induce nuclear accumulation preferentially of Smad1 (Fig.3 A) and its pattern of activation of XVent2-Luc (Fig. 3 B) and 3TP-Lux (Fig.3 C). These results suggest that the ability of the BMPR-I L45 sequence to specify an interaction with Smad1 is shared by the very divergent L45 sequence of ALK1 and -2 but not by the closely related L45 sequence of TβR-I. In light of this, we wondered whether Smad1 might recognize ALK1 and -2 and BMPR-I by different mechanisms. The ability of Smad1 and Smad2 to recognize BMPR-I and TβR-I, respectively, is determined by the sequence of the L3 loop (7Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y.G. Pavletich N. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). As inferred from the crystal structure of the Smad4 MH2 domain, the L3 loop protrudes from the surface of this domain (40Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The sequence of the L3 loop is identical within the Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8 subgroups, but differs at two critical positions between these two subgroups (Fig.4, A and B). Swapping these two residues between Smad1 and Smad2 switches their ability to interact with specific receptors (7Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y.G. Pavletich N. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Thus, a Smad2 mutant containing the two Smad1-specific residues in the L3 loop [Smad2(L1) construct] is preferentially activated by BMPR-I (7Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y.G. Pavletich N. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 A). Using this approach, we determined that ALK1(QD) and ALK2(QD) are relatively weak inducers of nuclear accumulation of Smad2(L1) even though they induce nuclear accumulation of Smad1 (Fig. 5 A). These results indicate that the L3 sequence alone is not sufficient to specify Smad1 recognition by ALK1 or ALK2. We searched Smad MH2 domains for other regions containing subtype-specific residues, that is, residues that would be different between Smad1 and -2 but conserved between Smad1, -5, -8, and Mad or between Smad2 and -3. The region immediately preceding the C-terminal phosphorylation sites contains four such residues (7Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y.G. Pavletich N. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, introduction of these mutations into Smad2, along with the L3 loop mutations, did not improve the ability of ALK1(QD) or ALK2(QD) to induce nuclear accumulation of the resulting construct (Fig.5 A, Smad2(LC1) construct). Another region with subtype-specific residues is a sequence corresponding to α-helix 1, which is a surface structure in Smad4 (40Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The corresponding sequence is conserved between Smad1 and Smad2 except for two residues that are subtype-specific (Fig. 4 A). These residues in Smad4 (Glu-374 and Arg-378) are separated by one turn of the α-helix and are exposed to solvent in the vicinity of the L3 loop (40Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). Because of their properties and location, we investigated whether these residues play a role as determinants of the interaction of Smad1 and ALK1 and -2. A Smad2 mutant containing these two residues from Smad1 [Smad2(H1–1)] did not respond to BMPR-IB(QD), ALK1(QD) or ALK2(QD) in the nuclear accumulation assay (Fig. 5 A). However, a Smad2 construct containing the two α-helix 1 residues and the two L3 loop residues from Smad1 [Smad2(HL1)] underwent a similar extent of nuclear accumulation when cotransfected with ALK1(QD), ALK2(QD) or BMPR-IB(QD) (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest a critical role of α-helix 1 in Smad1 recognition by ALK1 and ALK2. To verify that both α-helix 1 and the L3 loop are required for Smad1 recognition by ALK1 and 2, wild type and mutant Smad2 constructs were transfected into HepG2 cells with the constitutively active forms of receptors, and phosphorylation of Smad2 was determined. Consistent with the pattern of nuclear accumulation, coexpression of BMPR-IB(QD) increased the phosphorylation level of Smad2(L1) and Smad2(HL1), but not wild type Smad2, whereas coexpression of ALK1(QD) and ALK2(QD) only enhanced phosphorylation of Smad2(HL1) (Fig. 5 B). From these results, we conclude that two groups of Smad1-activating receptors coexist in vertebrates and possibly Drosophila, the BMPR-I group and the ALK1 group. A similar conclusion was recently reached by others using a different BMP reporter assay (41Macı́as-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the present work shows that the recognition and activation of Smad1 by ALK1 and ALK2 is specified by the L45 loop on the receptors and the L3 loop together with the α-helix 1 on Smad1 (Fig.6). It is likely that Saxophone recognizes Mad in a similar fashion because the L45 sequences of Saxophone and the L3 sequence and α-helix 1 sequence of Mad are very similar or identical to those of their counterparts in vertebrates. It is important to note that the structural elements identified here and previously (7Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y.G. Pavletich N. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), although playing a major role in dictating the specificity of the recognition between type I receptors and Smad proteins, may be only part of larger regions mediating the association between these proteins. Additionally, the correct assembly of receptor complexes and Smad protein complexes and/or the possible intervention of “adaptor” molecules might be important for the association of receptors and Smad proteins. The BMPR-I group and the ALK1 group recognize Smad1 through related but different mechanisms which involve different L45 sequences on the receptor kinase domain, and a differential use of two surface structures on the Smad1 MH2 domain. Smad1 recognition and activation by these two mechanisms might be qualitatively different in ways that cannot be discerned by the present assays. In a given cellular context, such differences might make one receptor more suitable than the other as an activator of the Smad1 pathway, or both receptors could activate Smad1 in complementary ways or with different response outcomes.

We previously reported the cloning of two mammalian genes, PLD1 and PLD2, that encode PLD activities. We additionally reported that PLD1 is activated in a synergistic manner by protein kinase c-α (PKC-α), ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), and Rho family members. We describe here molecular analysis of PLD1 using a combination of domain deletion and mutagenesis. We show that the amino-terminal 325 amino acids are required for PKC-α activation of PLD1 but not for activation by ARF1 and RhoA. This region does not contain the sole PKC-α interaction site and additionally functions to inhibit basal PLD activity in vivo. Second, a region of sequence unique to PLD1 (as compared with other PLDs) known as the “loop” region had been proposed to serve as an effector regulatory region but is shown here only to mediate inhibition of PLD1. Finally, we show that modification of the amino terminus, but not of the carboxyl terminus, is compatible with PLD enzymatic function and propose a simple model for PLD activation.

Isolation of the first PLD cDNA sequence from animals (human PLD1) revealed that an evolutionarily related PLD family was widespread and encoded several regions of conserved sequence (3Hammond S.M.

Use of these conserved regions for motif searches of sequence data bases then revealed the existence of additional related genes of known and unknown function from bacteria, viruses, and mammals (4Colley W.

A representative of this PLD superfamily (human PLD1) and the regions conserved in it are shown in Fig. 1. Two separate mammalian PLD genes approximately 50% identical have been reported (PLD1 and PLD2; Ref. 4Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J.

Sequence comparisons suggest that the mammalian genes arose through duplication of an ancestral gene after divergence occurred between the lower eukaryotes and animals (4Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R.

PLD proteins from most species exhibit constitutive activity when assayed in vitro, and their regulation in vivo is effected through mechanisms such as phosphorylation and translocation (11Rudge S.A.

Mammalian PLD2 is similarly constitutively active in vitro (4Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr.

In contrast, however, to PLD2 and PLDs from nonmammalian species, it has been reported that PLD1 exhibits a low basal activity when expressed in tissue culture cell lines or as a recombinant, purified protein in vitro and that it is stimulated in vitro in the presence of recombinant, purified protein kinase C-α (PKC-α) or ARF or Rho small GTP-binding protein family members (3Hammond S.M.

These findings also demonstrated that the effectors interact directly with PLD1, because no other proteins were present in the assays. Each class of effectors can act alone to stimulate PLD1, and in combination they elicit a synergistic activation (16Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y.

However, because PLD1 does not contain motifs frequently found in other kinds of signaling enzymes, such as C2, SH2, and SH3 domains, Rho binding sequences, or membrane localization signals, it was not readily apparent how the small GTP-binding protein and PKC-α interactions would be mediated. Moreover, PKC-α stimulation of PLD1 is conducted through a novel mechanism, because the stimulation is ATP-independent and appears to be mediated by the regulatory domain of PKC-α instead of its catalytic one (16Hammond S.M.

Site-directed mutagenesis of expression plasmids was carried out using the Quik-Change kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were sequenced to confirm the intended mutation and the integrity of the surrounding sequences for at least 100 base pairs using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Deletion mutants were constructed using convenient restriction sites or polymerase chain reaction-based strategies and were sequenced at all junctions to ensure that the reading frame was maintained. Insertional mutants were constructed by linearizing pCGN-PLD1 at unique sites in the open reading frame and religating in the presence of a linker that inserted 3 or 4 amino acids while maintaining the open reading frame. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum.

PKC-α was activated in the assay tube by the addition of phorbol ester to a final concentration of 100 nm. ATP was not present in the assay tubes to which PKC was added. The components were mixed on ice, and the reactions were initiated by transfer to a 37 °C water bath and then stopped after 30 min by addition of bovine serum albumin and trichloroacetic acid. The samples were centrifuged to precipitate unreacted lipid, and the supernatants containing the released [3H]choline were quantitated in a scintillation counter. Mammalian PLD activity was measured in vivo using the transphosphatidylation assay exactly as described previously (4Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J.

In brief, COS-7 cells were transfected with PLD1 plasmids, labeled with [3H]oleate for 24 h, washed, and cultured with 0.3% butanol with or without 100 nm PMA for 30 min. After removal of the medium, cold methanol was added to stop the reaction, and the lipids were extracted, dried, resuspended, and separated on a TLC plate. The phosphatidylbutanol lipids were visualized using iodine staining, scraped into a vial, and quantitated using a scintillation counter. PLD1 subcellular localization using Flu epitope or GFP-tagged PLD1 was visualized as described previously (4Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J.

In brief, COS-7 cells were fixed 24 h after transfection and analyzed using immunohistochemistry to detect the expressed proteins. The commercial monoclonal antibody, 12CA5 (Boehringer-Mannheim), was used to detect the Flu (HA) tag according to the supplier's recommendations. GFP-PLD1 was visualized directly. Wild-type or truncated PLD1 was transiently overexpressed in COS-7 cells in 35-mm dishes as described above. After 24 h of culture in medium containing serum, the cells were washed in Opti-MEM I lacking serum and cultured in fresh Opti-MEM I for an additional 20 min. The medium was then replaced by Opti-MEM I containing PMA at 100 nm. After an additional 5 min of culture, the cells were washed using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested from the dishes by scraping using ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated until lysis occurred. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C unless noted otherwise. The resulting lysate was precleared using a 3,000 × gspin for 5 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min to pellet the membranes. Pilot experiments had shown that virtually all of the PLD1 segregates to this pellet under these conditions. The membrane pellet was then resuspended in lysis buffer containing 2% cholate and immunoprecipitated through incubation with 10 μl of 12CA5 coupled to protein A-Sepharose on a rotator (12CA5 is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the Flu epitope tag fused to the amino terminus of the PLD1 constructs as expressed in pCGN). The beads were spun for 5 s at 16,000 × gand washed three times with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of wash buffer following which an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 8m urea was added (16Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q.

PLD1 contains several regions of sequence not found in mammalian PLD2 or PLDs from other species, and we and others have hypothesized that these regions confer the unusual regulatory properties of PLD1 (1Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 5: 182-185Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2.Frohman, M. A., Sung, T.-C., and Morris, A. J.

J. 1998; 329: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The most unique region is the “loop” sequence in the center of the protein (amino acids 505–620 in human PLD1a, Fig.1). Mammalian PLD2 lacks these 116 amino acids; yeast PLD (Spo14p) lacks an additional 30 amino acids, and the loop region is similarly absent from all other known PLD proteins except for one from Caenorhabditis elegans, in which the loop peptide is increased in size to 300 amino acids (the regulatory properties of this C. elegans PLD have not been reported; GenBankTM accession number U55854). Part of the PLD1 loop region undergoes alternative splicing, removing 33 amino acids to generate the PLD1b isoform (9Redina O. Frohman M.A. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 22: 53-60Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J.

This regulated splicing is conserved in mouse, rat, and human and confers no obvious changes in regulation to human PLD1 (16Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

Kodaki T. Nagamachi Y. Yamashita S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The loop region is the least well conserved region when mouse, rat, and human PLD1 sequences are compared. The amino termini are well conserved between different mammalian PLD1 proteins but exhibit little similarity to the amino termini of mammalian PLD2 or PLDs from nonmammalian species. This is particularly true for the first 100 amino acids. Weak homology is observed from amino acids 100–330 including a PX domain (2.Frohman, M. A., Sung, T.-C., and Morris, A. J. (1999) inPhospholipase D: Biochimica Biophysica Acta: Lipids and Lipid Metabolism (Daniel, L. W., ed.) in press.Google Scholar) and a weakly significant PH domain (22Steed P.M. Clark K.L. Boyar W.C. Lasala D.J. FASEB. 1998; 12: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PX domains have been proposed to mediate a wide variety of protein-protein interactions (23Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and PH domains frequently mediate inositol lipid and phosphate binding (PIP2 is a requisite co-factor for PLD1 and PLD2). Many membrane-associated proteins require free amino termini to successfully interact with membrane surfaces, particularly if they encode prenylation sequences. PLD1 does not encode such sequences, and it was known from earlier studies that a free amino terminus was not required because the protein appears to behave normally when fused to an amino-terminal Flu epitope peptide (3Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar,4Colley W.

In contrast to the amino terminus, the final 41 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus are relatively well conserved between PLD1, PLD2, and some of the PLDs from nonmammalian species (2.Frohman, M. A., Sung, T.-C., and Morris, A. J. (1999) inPhospholipase D: Biochimica Biophysica Acta: Lipids and Lipid Metabolism (Daniel, L. W., ed.) in press.Google Scholar). To assess the potential role of PLD1-specific sequences in PLD1 activation by effectors, a series of deletion mutants were constructed, transfected into COS-7 cells, and assayed for basal and stimulated PLD activities. As shown in the top line of Fig.2 A (and see figure legend), PLD activity in COS-7 cell lysates overexpressing wild-type PLD1 increases dramatically (30–60-fold) in the presence of small GTP-binding proteins or PKC-α. However, three proximal deletion mutant proteins (Δ1–100, 1–157, and 1–228) were found to be inactive (Fig. 2 A) and to differing degrees, unstable (Fig.2 B), suggesting that critical regions had been deleted or that protein misfolding occurred as a result of the missing sequences. However, Δ1–325 was both stable and active, demonstrating that the minimal sequence required for catalysis does not include the amino-terminal third of the protein. The atypical stability of this truncated protein may result from the fact that the site surrounding amino acid 325 appears to constitute a protein domain boundary, as suggested by the fact that amino acid similarity between yeast and mammalian PLD dramatically increases carboxyl-terminal to this point (1Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 5: 182-185Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Strikingly, however, Δ1–325 was capable of being activated only by ARF and Rho small GTP-binding protein family members; no response to PKC-α was observed (the in vitro assay was also conducted on Δ1–325 generated and purified from baculovirus with similar results; data not shown). The result demonstrates that a sequence uniquely required for activation of PLD1 by PKC-α is present in the amino terminus of the protein. To extend this observation, Δ1–325 was expressed in COS-7 cells and assayed using the transphosphatidylation assay (Fig. 2 C). A low endogenous PLD basal activity and a modest response to PMA was observed in cells transfected with K898R, a catalytically inactive PLD1 allele (8Sung T.C. Roper R. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), whereas a robust response to PMA was observed for wild-type PLD1 (11-fold above basal, after subtraction of the endogenous component of the response). However, no PMA-stimulated increase in activity was observed for PLD1-Δ1–325, confirming that the amino terminus appears to be required for PLD1 to respond to PKC-α. Similar results were observed after down-regulation of PKC-α through a 4-h pretreatment with PMA (Fig. 2 D). Unexpectedly, Δ1–325 assayed in vivo exhibited a significantly and reproducibly increased (2-fold) basal activity in comparison with wild-type PLD1 (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that a component of the normal physiological regulation of PLD1 in vivo requires the amino terminus to be intact. The mechanism underlying the increased basal activity in vivo is not apparent. Possibilities include increased sensitivity in vivo to small GTP-binding proteins or changes in subcellular location to sites more conducive to PLD1 activation. Δ1–325 remains membrane-localized similar to PLD1 as determined by subcellular fractionation (data not shown), but the specific sites to which it is targeted may be altered. These results also suggested that the PH-like region encoded by amino acids 220–329 is unlikely to underlie the absolute requirement for PIP2 exhibited by PLD1 (3Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M.

Receptors for androgens, glucocorticoids, progesterone, and mineralocorticoids all recognize the same DNA response elements, and very little is known about the mechanisms governing the hormone-specific transcription of target genes in vivo by these receptors (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

Obvious ways to achieve steroid-specific gene activation include cell-specific expression of the receptor protein and differential availability of the ligand. In many instances, these may not suffice, and tissue-specific coregulatory proteins have been suggested to add an important level of control to ensure that appropriate responses to hormonal signals are achieved. It has been somewhat unexpected that most of the numerous nuclear hormone receptor coactivators identified to date are expressed in a ubiquitous fashion and bind to the same conserved activation function-2 (AF-2) 1The abbreviations used are: AF, activation function; ANPK, androgen receptor-interacting nuclear protein kinase; AR, androgen receptor; ARE, androgen response element; ARIP, androgen receptor-interacting protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DBD, DNA-binding domain; DOTAP, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate; GBP, Gu/RH-II binding protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; ID, interacting domain; LBD, ligand-binding domain; LUC, luciferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; PGC, PPAR γ coactivator; PIAS, protein inhibitor of activated STAT; ZFR, zinc finger region; SNURF, small nuclear RING finger; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.1The abbreviations used are: AF, activation function; ANPK, androgen receptor-interacting nuclear protein kinase; AR, androgen receptor; ARE, androgen response element; ARIP, androgen receptor-interacting protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DBD, DNA-binding domain; DOTAP, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate; GBP, Gu/RH-II binding protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; ID, interacting domain; LBD, ligand-binding domain; LUC, luciferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; PGC, PPAR γ coactivator; PIAS, protein inhibitor of activated STAT; ZFR, zinc finger region; SNURF, small nuclear RING finger; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. located in the C terminus of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (3Horwitz K.B.

Bound proteins were released in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, resolved by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, and visualized by fluorography. Bacterially expressed H6-ARIP3(443–548) was purified by chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), and polyclonal antisera were raised in rabbits. To study subcellular distribution of ARIP3, CV-1 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pFLAG-ARIP3(11–572) as described (7Moilanen A.-M. Karvonen U. Poukka H. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Biol.

Cells were processed, and ARIP3 was visualized using anti-ARIP3 antiserum (1:500 dilution) or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody as described previously (7Moilanen A.-M. Karvonen U. Poukka H.

Toppari J. Huhtaniemi I. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2904-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), anti-ARIP3 antibody (1:1000), purified by affinity chromatography on HiTrap-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing covalently attached antigen, was used along with Vectastain Elite-Kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions (8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that interact with the zinc finger region of AR. The target sequence (residues 554–644 of human AR) also includes one-third of the hinge region. Northern blot analysis of mRNAs from human and rat tissues revealed that one of the cDNA clones hybridized to a ∼2-kilobase transcript expressed predominantly or solely in the testis (Fig. 1). The protein encoded by this transcript was termed ARIP3 (androgen receptor-interactingprotein 3. The complete cDNA sequence of ARIP3 isolated from rat testis cDNA library contains an open reading frame of 572 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 63.3 kDa (Fig.2). The 1860-base pair sequence has a 115-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region with stop codons in front of a consensus translation start site and a polyadenylation signal downstream of the translation termination codon (GenBankTMaccession number AF044058). ARIP3 is particularly rich in Ser/Thr (18%), Leu/Ile (15%), proline (9%), and charged amino acids (22%). On the basis of ARIP3 sequences isolated by the two-hybrid screen, C-terminal residues 443–548 appear to be sufficient for the interaction with AR. ARIP3 shows extensive sequence identity with a recently cloned protein termed Miz1 that interacts with the homeodomain protein Msx2 (20Wu L. Wu H. Sangiorgi F. Wu N. Bell J.R. Lyons G.E. Maxson R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Residues 1–419 of murine Miz1 are 99.5% identical with amino acids 132–550 of rat ARIP3, suggesting that Miz1 and ARIP3 are encoded by mRNAs that are splice variants of the same gene. ARIP3 is also highly homologous to two recently identified proteins, mouse PIAS3 and human GBP (21Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 22Valdez B.C. Hennig D. Perlaky L. Busch R. Busch H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment revealed distinct regions that are well conserved in all three proteins, with amino acid identities ranging from 60 to 80% (Fig. 2). Most of the C-terminal region of ARIP3 that harbors the AR ID (residues 443–548) is unique to ARIP3 (Fig. 2). A mammalian two-hybrid system in COS-1 cells was used to confirm that AR-ARIP3 interaction is not a feature peculiar to yeast cells. Transfection of VP16-ARIP3 ID together with Gal4-rAR fusion protein yielded a strong reporter activity, indicating an efficient interaction between AR and ARIP3 ID (Fig.3 A). The full-length ARIP3 and AR also associated in intact cells, and in agreement with the above data, deletion of the ID diminished markedly this interaction. Together these results demonstrate that ARIP3 residues 443–548 are critical for the AR-ARIP3 interaction to occur (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, association of AR to ARIP3 ID was attenuated by the presence of androgen, whereas the interaction of AR with full-length ARIP3 was slightly enhanced by the hormone. The amount of immunoreactive Gal4-rAR protein was not influenced by the presence of androgen. 3A.-M. Moilanen, J. J. Palvimo, and O. A. Jänne, unpublished observations. AR LBD alone did not associate with ARIP3 ID (Fig. 3 A), and the N-terminal half of AR encompassing AF-1 (residues 5–538) failed to recognize either ARIP3 ID or full-length ARIP3,3 indicating that AR interacts with ARIP3 ID primarily through the ZFR. However, AR LBD exhibited a weak hormone-enhanced interaction with full-length ARIP3 (Fig. 3 A). GST pull-down experiments were used to examine the interaction of AR ZFR with ARIP3 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3 A(inset), 35S-labeled ARIP3 produced by translation in vitro binds specifically to GST-ZFR immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose. These results thus indicate that ARIP3 is capable of a direct physical interaction with AR. This conclusion was strengthened by results that 35S-labeled full-length ARIP3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-AR antiserum (K183; Refs. 7Moilanen A.-M. Karvonen U. Poukka H. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2527-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and 8Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) from an extract of COS-1 cells transfected with pSG5rAR but not from an extract of cells without AR expression (Fig.3 B). In concert with the presence of putative nuclear localization signals in the ARIP3 sequence, transiently expressed ARIP3 antigen resided exclusively in CV-1 cell nuclei and presented a speckled pattern of distribution (Fig.4). In adult rat testis, ARIP3 antigen was detected in the nuclei of Sertoli cells, in spermatogonia, and in primary spermatocytes up to late pachytene stage of development (Fig.5 A). The immunogen sequence (ARIP3(443–548)) used to raise anti-ARIP3 antibodies is shared with Miz1 (20Wu L. Wu H. Sangiorgi F. Wu N. Bell J.R. Lyons G.E. Maxson R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and thus, the staining of testicular cells may not be completely specific for ARIP3.Figure 5Distribution of ARIP3 immunoreactivity in different cell types of the seminiferous epithelium of rat testis.Immunoperoxidase technique was applied to visualize ARIP3 antigen using polyclonal antiserum as described under “Experimental Procedures.”A, ARIP3 can be detected in the nuclei of Sertoli cells (arrowheads), spermatogonia (double arrowhead) and in primary spermatocytes (arrows). B, control staining with normal rabbit IgG used as a primary antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) COS-1 cells devoid of endogenous AR and ARIP3 were transfected with expression vectors encoding ARIP3 and rat AR along with a reporter driven by two AREs in front of E1b TATA sequence. Low amounts of coexpressed ARIP3 enhanced AR-dependent transactivation up to 4-fold, but the effect vanished gradually with increasing amounts of ARIP3 expression plasmid (Fig.6 A). Deletion of AR-interacting region (ARIP3Δ467–547) rendered the protein inactive, implying that direct interaction between AR and ARIP3 is indeed required for ARIP3 to influence receptor function (Fig. 6 A). ARIP3 exhibited a similar biphasic dose-response curve with the natural probasin promoter. In this latter case, however, the activating effect of ARIP3 was weaker, and the highest amount of ARIP3 repressed significantly AR-dependent transcription (Fig.6 B). Ectopic ARIP3 expression did not influence either promoter in the absence of AR or in the presence of AR without androgen, and no effect was measured on reporters driven by constitutively active viral promoters such as CMV and SV-40.3 In addition, empty pFLAG-CMV-2 (100–800 ng) modified AR function by less than ± 10%.3 ARIP3 contains two LXXLL motifs starting at residues 18 and 304 as well as two LXXLI motifs at residues 157 and 402 (Fig. 2). LXXLL motifs are needed for the recognition of several coregulators by AF-2 regions in nuclear receptor LBDs (23Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Some of the LXXLL motif-containing coactivator proteins were recently shown to facilitate the interaction between N- and C-terminal regions of AR, when these domains were expressed as separate polypeptides (24Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Likewise, coexpressed ARIP3 facilitated the interaction between N and C termini, in that it enhanced transcriptional activity in a modified two-hybrid assay only when the N- and C-terminal regions were expressed concomitantly in the presence of androgen (Fig. 6 C). Empty pFLAG-CMV-2 (50–200 ng) had no effect in this assay. 4J. J. Palvimo, A.-M. Moilanen, H. Poukka, and O. A. Jänne, unpublished observations. The identification of a large number of nuclear receptor-interacting proteins over the last several years and the evidence from biochemical and genetic studies suggest that to regulate transcription, nuclear receptors must exist as parts of large multiprotein complexes (3Horwitz K.B.

Cell. 1997; 90: 391-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have identified a testis-specific interaction partner of AR, termed ARIP3. ARIP3 immunoreactivity is present in all stages of seminiferous epithelial cycle, with the early meiotic spermatocytes showing the highest protein levels. ARIP3 interacts with AR both in intact mammalian cells and in vitro, and it is capable of modulating AR-dependent transcriptional activity. The biphasic responses could be interpreted to mean that ARIP3 belongs to a multisubunit coactivator complex, and its overexpression leads to repression of transcription when other limiting components are titrated out of the complex. The role that the LXXLL motifs of ARIP3 play in this context requires further studies. Similar to interactions between some nuclear receptors and the coactivators PCAF, SNURF, ANPK, and PGC-1 (6Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), the association between AR and ARIP3 is mediated principally through the ZFR. ARIP3 is also capable of facilitating the androgen-dependent interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions of the receptor. In addition to proteins mentioned above, the POU domain-containing proteins Oct-1/2 and Brn-3a/3b as well as TLS/FUS have been shown to interact with the ZFRs of nuclear receptors (5Powers C.A. Mather M. Raaka B.M. Ron D. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Prefontaine G.G. Lemieux M.E. Giffen W. Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. LaCasse E.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1029-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These examples support the conclusion that besides binding to DNA, the ZFR plays an important role in the formation of heterologous protein-protein contacts. ARIP3 represents an alternatively spliced form of the transcription factor Msx2-interacting protein Miz1 (20Wu L. Wu H. Sangiorgi F. Wu N. Bell J.R. Lyons G.E. Maxson R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The high degree of sequence conservation among several distinct regions of ARIP3, GBP, PIAS3, PIAS1, and related sequences (21Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 22Valdez B.C. Hennig D. Perlaky L. Busch R. Busch H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1998; 95: 10626-20631Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) indicates the existence of a novel gene family. GBP was discovered in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with RNA helicase II (22Valdez B.C. Hennig D. Perlaky L. Busch R. Busch H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and it is almost identical with PIAS1 (27Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-20631Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). PIAS3 and PIAS1 were identified by a similar approach as proteins interfering with Stat3 and Stat1 function, respectively (21Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 27Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-20631Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Using cDNA library screening, Liu et al. (27Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-20631Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) also isolated a group of other PIAS sequences, namely PIASxα, PIASxβ, and PIASy. ARIP3 appears to be identical with PIASxα, whereas Miz1 corresponds to PIASxβ. PIAS3 and PIAS1 were demonstrated to bind to activated Stat3 and Stat1, respectively, and thereby inhibit their DNA binding activities in vitro (21Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 27Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-20631Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Attenuation of STAT-DNA interaction was suggested to be the mechanism for the repressing functions of PIAS1 and PIAS3. This is in contrast to findings with Miz1, which enhanced DNA-binding affinity of Msx2 in vitro (20Wu L. Wu H. Sangiorgi F. Wu N. Bell J.R. Lyons G.E. Maxson R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and with ARIP3, which influenced minimally the binding of AR to its cognate DNA elements. 4J. J. Palvimo, A.-M. Moilanen, H. Poukka, and O. A. Jänne, unpublished observations. Interestingly, PIASxα was not able to influence either the DNA binding activity of Stat1 or Stat1-mediated gene activation (27Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-20631Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The C-terminal regions of ARIP3/PIAS proteins are poorly conserved, suggesting that these domains are mainly responsible for the transcription factor-specific effects. ARIP3 was the only family member found in our yeast two-hybrid screen of mouse embryo cDNA library, most likely due to its unique C terminus. It is currently unclear whether ARIP3/PIAS family members indeed utilize distinct modes of action to regulate transcription by their interacting partners. Their further characterization, such as identification of STAT-interacting domains of PIAS1 and PIAS3 along with clarification of the function of LXXLL motifs conserved among the proteins, is necessary for elucidation of the underlying regulatory mechanisms.

Evidence suggests that it can participate in several DNA transactions in vivo, including DNA replication (1Jenkins T.M. Saxena J.K. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Ackerman E.J.

Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4272) Google Scholar). There are at least two forms of base excision repair (BER) in mammalian cells (5Wilson S.H. Mutat.

Alternatively, BER may occur by excision of 2 to 6 nucleotides involving proliferating cell nuclear antigen and flap endonuclease 1, and DNA synthesis may be catalyzed by pol β (10Klungland A.

This pathway is referred to as “alternate” BER.Early studies of the fidelity of DNA synthesis by pol β employed a long single-stranded template within a 390-nucleotide gap (14Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5787-5796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The average pol β error rate for the 12 possible base substitution errors was 7 × 10−4 (15Kunkel T.A. Alexander P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 160-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the average error rate for single-base deletion errors was 3–9 × 10−4 (16Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These rates are substantially higher than those measured for the other cellular DNA polymerases that perform the bulk of genomic DNA replication (17Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Sabatino R.D. Myers T.W. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Bambara R.A. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11751-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These higher error rates seem consistent with the fact that pol β lacks an intrinsic 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease activity. The observations that pol β has low frameshift fidelity and synthesizes DNA in a distributive manner during primer extension to copy long single-stranded templates suggested that deletion errors within mononucleotide template runs may result from strand slippage initiated during the dissociation-reassociation phase of a polymerization reaction (18Kunkel T.A.

Biol. 1998; 278: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and is central to the present study (see below).Given that perhaps as many as one million damaged nucleotides per cell per day may be repaired by BER (21Holmquist G.P. Mutat. Res. 1998; 400: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), any low fidelity DNA synthesis during BER could potentially introduce a number of mismatches into the eukaryotic genome. Thus, it is important to understand the fidelity of the pol β synthetic reaction. However, recent studies suggest that pol β synthesis to fill a short gap may differ significantly from that during a distributive primer extension reaction. Pol β contains a polymerase domain that binds to duplex template-primer DNA and a unique 8-kDa processivity domain (22Kumar A. Widen S.G. Williams K.R. Kedar P. Karpel R.L. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2124-2131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that contains the active site for AP lyase activity (23Matsumoto Y. Kim K.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6456-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This 8-kDa domain binds to the 5′-phosphate in short gap substrates (27Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to single-stranded DNA (28Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such that DNA synthesis by pol β to fill gaps of 2–6 nucleotides is processive rather than distributive (29Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a pol β·DNA·ddNTP complex revealed that the 5′-terminal phosphate in a single nucleotide gap is bound near the AP lyase active site (25Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). A 90° kink in the DNA template is also observed, precisely at the 5′-phosphodiester linkage of the template base in the polymerase active site. This sharp bend exposes the base pair on the downstream side of the active site, allowing that template-strand base to stack with a histidine residue in the 8-kDa domain rather than with its neighboring base in the active site. This alteration in base stacking interactions has been suggested to be relevant to the fidelity of a single-nucleotide gap-filling reaction (31Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Moreover, cross-linking studies suggested that the 8-kDa domain also contributes to dNTP binding in the polymerase active site (32Lavrik O.I. Prasad R. Beard W.A. Safronov I.V. Dobrikov M.I.

Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3728-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike distributive synthesis on a long single-stranded template, pol β fills gaps of up to 6 nucleotides in a processive manner, and the 8-kDa domain participates in this reaction in multiple ways.Since the processive gap-filling reaction may be more relevant to the fidelity of BER than the earlier studies of distributive primer extension, we have developed in the present study three short gap substrates with which to measure fidelity. One substrate is a model for the predominant role of pol β in simple BER. This substrate contains a single template adenine in a single-nucleotide gap, similar to the gapped substrates used in recent kinetic studies of misinsertion by rat pol β (34Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35Ahn J. Kraynov V.S. Zhong X. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.-D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The other two gapped DNA substrates are models for synthesis in the alternate BER pathway; one contains a 5-base gap and a target for scoring eight different base substitution errors, including the same three misincorporations opposite template adenine as in the 1-base gap (this substrate was used earlier to identify pol β mutants with strongly reduced base substitution fidelity (36Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar)); the other substrate contains a 6-nucleotide target to monitor the single-base deletions within a TTTT run during processive synthesis.The results reveal that pol β has low fidelity when filling short gaps, and generates errors not previously observed during distributive synthesis, including clustered multiple substitutions and complex additions. Base substitution error rates are similar during filling of a >300-nucleotide gap and a 5-nucleotide gap, but are lower for three mispairs during synthesis to fill a single-nucleotide gap. Single-base deletion error rates in a homopolymeric run are similar during distributive and processive synthesis. These data are discussed in light of a model wherein the 8-kDa domain of pol β influences fidelity during the filling of short gaps.DISCUSSIONDNA polymerase β plays a key role in mammalian base excision repair. Pol β is a small nuclear DNA polymerase with a host of biochemical properties that make this enzyme well suited for its role in base excision repair. Pol β carries both gap-tailoring (23Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) and gap-filling enzymatic activities (29Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and it physically interacts with at least 3 other base excision repair proteins: AP endonuclease (45Bennett R.A.O. Wilson D.M.I. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), DNA ligase I (46Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Structure-function analysis revealed that the enzyme has a processivity domain which functions only on short-gapped substrates (27Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, additional roles of pol β have been suggested, most involving synthesis to fill relatively short-gapped intermediates in recombination (3Plug A.W. Clairmont C.A. Sapi E. Ashley T. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1327-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Nowak R. Woszczynski M. Siedlecki J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and replication (1Jenkins T.M. Saxena J.K. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Ackerman E.J. Science. 1992; 258: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Sweasy J.B. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A noteworthy feature of pol β is that it does not have an intrinsic proofreading exonuclease activity (50Tanabe K. Bohn E.W. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3401-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In mammalian cells, several base excision repair pathways have been identified, involving filling of a single nucleotide gap and a gap of 2 to 6 nucleotides. Evidence indicates that pol β performs gap-filling in both of these BER pathways (8Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kühn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 10Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 11Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and that synthesis to fill gaps of 2 to 6 nucleotides can be processive (29Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand the fidelity of these base excision repair processes, as well as fidelity during primer extension to copy long single-stranded templates that may be relevant to pol β's participation in some types of replication (1Jenkins T.M. Saxena J.K. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Ackerman E.J. Science. 1992; 258: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and recombination events (3Plug A.W. Clairmont C.A. Sapi E. Ashley T. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1327-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Nowak R. Woszczynski M. Siedlecki J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we describe here the base substitution and single-base deletion fidelity of recombinant pol β using substrates containing gaps of varying sizes. Data obtained with the 390-base gapped substrate (Table I, Fig. 1) demonstrate that error rates and error specificities during distributive synthesis by the recombinant rat and human enzymes are similar to earlier studies of native pol β purified from several eukaryotic sources (14Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5787-5796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kunkel T.A. Alexander P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 160-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12866-12874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The error specificities of all the pols β tested to date include the same hot spots for single-base deletions and for dislocation base substitution errors. These data indicate that the recombinant polymerases β are valid models for understanding principles that govern the fidelity of the native polymerases. The error rates of the recombinant rat and human enzymes are also similar to each other (TableI). Although there are 14 amino acid differences between the rat and human polymerases β, all are located on the surface of the enzymes in the crystal structures (31Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and the data in Table I and Fig. 1indicate that the differences do not influence fidelity when these enzymes synthesize DNA in the absence of other BER proteins.Recombinant human pol β generates 1 base substitution error for every 13,000 nucleotides polymerized during synthesis to fill a 390-nucleotide gap. This average rate is for the 12 possible mispairs that can be scored at 125 detectable template nucleotides in thelacZ target. The error rate varies markedly by mispair and position (Fig. 1). During synthesis to fill gaps of >300 nucleotides, pol β is less accurate than average at either of two opalcodons, generating 1 base substitution error for every 1,800 nucleotides polymerized (Table IV). With all three long gaps, no downstream 5′ terminus is adjacent to the site at which errors are scored, and synthesis is distributive. The average single-base substitution error rate at the opal codon during synthesis to fill a 5-nucleotide gap is even higher, 1/770 (13 × 10−4, Table IV). This value is similar to the misinsertion rates for G·dTMP and G·dAMP mispairs determined by Chagovetzet al. (34Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) using a 6-nucleotide gap. In our study with a 5-nucleotide gap with the template nucleotides for scoring errors only 2, 3, or 4 nucleotides distant from the 5′ terminus (Fig. 1), we also observe multiple base substitution errors (Fig. 3) at a rate much higher than during distributive filling of longer gaps (Table III). Closely-spaced substitution errors have not been observed in the spectra of errors generated in vitro by other DNA polymerases. Key to considering their origins and the generally low fidelity of pol β are biochemical (36Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and structural information suggesting that the ability of a polymerase to form hydrogen bonds or van der Waal contacts with atoms in the minor groove of the nucleic acid is important. In the structures of the Pol I family polymerases, the DNA near the polymerase active site is A-form-like with a wide, shallow minor groove, and these polymerases form hydrogen bonds with minor groove O-2 and N-3 atoms (51Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 52Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Braman J.C. Beese L.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 53Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, in the ternary complex of pol β with a single nucleotide gap, the duplex DNA is B-form and there are fewer hydrogen bonds between the polymerase and the duplex primer stem upstream of the active site (30Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). If the DNA is also B-form when pol β is bound to a 5-nucleotide gap, it may be less able than other polymerases to sense correct base pairing geometry in the active site and/or at the primer terminus. This might account for the overall low base substitution fidelity of pol β and for generation of multiple mutations during 5-nucleotide gap filling. The ability of pol β to generate multiple, closely-spaced substitutions is also consistent with a model (Fig.4 A), wherein the 8-kDa domain binds to the downstream 5′ terminus to promote processive extension of misinserted nucleotides that cannot be proofread because pol β lacks 3′-exonuclease activity. Consistent with this idea, the kinetic constant for DNA synthesis during filling of short gaps is greater than that for product release (35Ahn J. Kraynov V.S. Zhong X. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.-D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).In experiments in which UV-irradiated shuttle vectors containing a bacterial suppressor tRNA gene were employed as a mutagenic target (54Hauser J. Seidman M.M. Sidur K. Dixon K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 55Protic-Sabljic M. Tutejs N. Munson P.J. Hauser J. Kraemer K.H. Dixon K. Mol. Cell.

Waters H.L. Seidman M.M. Mutat. Res. 1991; 254: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a significant number of multiple substitution mutations were observed. The data presented here suggest that these errors could have resulted from gap-filling synthesis in vivo by DNA polymerase β. More recently, we have found that the spectrum of somatic hypermutations within an immunoglobulin gene in mismatch repair-deficient pms2(−/−) mice is characterized by a high proportion of tandem double-base substitutions that could result from error-prone filling of short gaps by pol β (58Winter D.B. Phung Q.H. Umar A. Baker S.M. Tarone R.E. Tanaka K. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Bohr V.A. Gearhart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6953-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).During synthesis to fill a 1-nucleotide gap, human pol β makes one mistake for every 4,500 nucleotides polymerized at the opalcodon (Table IV). This average rate is about 6-fold lower than for filling a 5-nucleotide gap (Table IV), with rates for individual misincorporations opposite template adenine being 2–9-fold lower than during 5-nucleotide gap filling (Table III). These differences could at least partly be explained by decreased T4 DNA ligase activity when mispairs are present at the nick. The relatively low base substitution fidelity of pol β and the small differences in fidelity for filling a 1-nucleotide gap versus a longer gap are consistent with kinetic determinations of misinsertion fidelity reported by Ahnet al. (35Ahn J. Kraynov V.S. Zhong X. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.-D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). They found (see values in parentheses in TableIII) that pol β was not highly accurate for the same three mispairs (albeit in a different sequence context), and that the fidelity of pol β for single-nucleotide gap-filling varied no more than 10-fold from that observed during synthesis with a non-gapped template-primer. However, our results are in contrast to observations by Chagovetzet al. (34Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), who report much higher fidelity for filling a single-nucleotide gap. As one example, they reported that pol β misinserts TMP opposite template guanine (typically one of the most frequent errors by DNA polymerases) at a rate of only 1 × 10−5, a rate 180 times lower than during synthesis to fill the 6-nucleotide gap (34Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). There are several possible explanations for the difference between this study and ours, including the fact that different mispairs were examined and these were in different neighboring sequence contexts. Nonetheless, we conclude from the present study, and that of Ahn et al. (35Ahn J. Kraynov V.S. Zhong X. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.-D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), that the average base substitution fidelity of pol β is low during single-nucleotide gap filling. The fidelity of BER in vivo may still be higher since other BER proteins could enhance pol β selectivity or inefficient ligation of mispairs could allow removal of misinsertions by a 3′-exonuclease not intrinsic to pol β.This study and the Ahn et al. (35Ahn J. Kraynov V.S. Zhong X. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.-D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and Chagovetz et al. (34Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D. J.

A possible explanation is that the 8-kDa domain, which binds to the downstream 5′ terminus, contributes to polymerase selectivity during synthesis of the final nucleotide in a gap. Biochemical evidence for this comes from cross-linking studies which suggest that the 8-kDa domain contributes to dNTP binding in the polymerase active site (32Lavrik O.I. Prasad R. Beard W.A. Safronov I.V. Dobrikov M.I. Srivastava D.K. Shishkin G.V. Wood T.G. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) reveals a 90° kink in the DNA at the 5′-phosphodiester linkage of the template residue in the polymerase active site. This exposes the (n+1) base pair on the downstream side of the active site, which stacks with His-34 in the 8-kDa domain rather than with the active site template base (Fig.5 A). Elimination of base-base stacking could prevent nonspecific stabilization of incorrect incoming dNTPs, thus providing a selective advantage for correct incorporation. Stacking of the (n+1) base with His-34 is not observed in the structure of a rat pol β·DNA·ddNTP complex which lacks a downstream primer (59Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). Moreover, the latter structure reveals minimal interactions of the 8-kDa domain with the polymerase active site, such that it may not contribute to dNTP binding (Fig.5 B).Figure 5The role of the 8-kDa domain of pol β in DNA synthesis fidelity.

In the present report we show that visible light exposure of mouse cultured 661W photoreceptor cells at 4.5 milliwatt/cm2 caused a significant increase in oxidative damage of 661W cells, leading to apoptosis of these cells. These cells show constitutive expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and light exposure of photoreceptor cells results in lowering of NF-κB levels in both the nuclear and cytosolic fractions in a time-dependent manner.

Immunocytochemical studies using antibody to RelA subunit of NF-κB further revealed the presence of this subunit constitutively both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the 661W cells. Upon exposure to photo-oxidative stress, a depletion of the cytoplasmic and nuclear RelA subunit was observed. The depletion of NF-κB appears to be mediated through involvement of caspase-1. Furthermore, transfection of these cells with a dominant negative mutant IκBα greatly enhanced the kinetics of down modulation of NF-κB, resulting in a faster photo-oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.

Hankel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). NF-κB exists in an inactive form bound to the inhibitory protein IκBα or IκBβ (2Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 3Thompson J. Phillips R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S.

Treatment of cells with inducers such as lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), generally result in degradation of IκB proteins. This releases NF-κB of its inhibitory constraint, facilitating its translocation to the nucleus, resulting in regulation of expression of genes encoding cytokines, hematopoietic growth factors, and cellular adhesion molecules. NF-κB exhibits its DNA binding activity in its dimeric form, and the most commonly occurring dimer is that of the p50 and the p65 (RelA) subunits. NF-κB has been shown to be constitutively active in several cell types, including B cells (5Grilli M. Jason J.S. Lenardo M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), thymocytes (6Sen J. Venkataraman L. Shinkai Y. Pierce J. Alt F. Burakoff S. Sen R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3213-3221PubMed Google Scholar), and neurons (7Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Neumann H. Wekerle H. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3981-3992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the earlier studies on NF-κB focused on its role in immunological and inflammation responses (1Baeuerle P.A. Hankel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar, 8Liou H.-C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 9Siebenlist U. Fanzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that NF-κB is also activated by oxidative signaling (10Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 11Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 12Pinkus R. Wiener L.M.

Commun. 1996; 226: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been suggested in many of these studies that reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) may be involved in the activation of NF-κB. Another area of research, where NF-κB involvement is gaining momentum, is the regulation of apoptosis. One of the earliest significant observations in this direction was made by Beg et al. (14Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar), who demonstrated extensive apoptosis of liver cells leading to embryonic death of mice lacking the RelA subunit. Subsequent work by Beg and Baltimore (15Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar) demonstrated that treatment of RelA-deficient (RelA−/−) mouse fibroblasts and macrophages, with TNF-α, resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability. Along similar lines, Wang et al. (16Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar), Van Antwerp et al. (17Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar), and Liu et al. (18Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar) showed a role of NF-κB in suppression of TNF-α-induced apoptosis. There is also evidence of pro-apoptotic aspects of RelA activity. For instance, it was shown that serum starvation of 293 cells causes cell death accompanied by the activation of RelA containing NF-κB (19Grimm S. Bauer M. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In several experimental models of retinal dystrophies, including certain forms of retinitis pigmentosa, photoreceptor cells of the retina have been shown to undergo apoptosis (20Agarwal N. Jomary C.

Eye Res. 1997; 64: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A number of studies have identified the primary mutations involved in the etiology of these diseases (24Berson E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4526-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These studies, however, do not completely explain the ultimate phenotypic manifestation of the disease namely apoptosis of photoreceptor cells. The difficulty in studying the disease process of retinal dystrophies is further compounded by non availability of a homogenous permanent photoreceptor cell line, since retina is a complex tissue of multiple cell types. In the current studies we have used a transformed mouse photoreceptor cell line 661W. 2M. J. Crawford, R. R. Krishnamoorthy, H. J. Sheedlo, D. T. Organisciak, R. S. Roque, N. Agarwal, and M. R.

Walker V.S. Kang B.S. Berman S. Investig. Ophthalmol. 1966; 5: 450-473PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, light has been extensively studied as an initiator of retinal cell death in a number of in vivo(31Penn J.S. Howard A.G. William T.P. LaVail M.M. Hollyfield J.G. Anderson R.E.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1994: 1-29Google Scholar) and in vitro experimental conditions. In the current study, we assessed the contribution of an oxidative stress paradigm to the propensity of photoreceptor cells to proceed to cell death via apoptosis, using cultured photoreceptor cells. We provide evidence in this paper that visible light exposure to photoreceptor cells results in oxidative damage leading to apoptosis via down-modulation of NF-κB. NF-κB, which was constitutively expressed in the 661W cells, was found to be progressively down-regulated upon exposure of the cells to light. By immunocytochemistry using NF-κB RelA antibody, the NF-κB activity appeared to be localized both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of dark-exposed 661W cells. Upon exposure to light the nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-κB RelA immunolabeling was largely diminished in these cells. Pretreatment of the cells with various antioxidants prevented to a great extent the down-modulation of NF-κB and also protected the cells from apoptosis. Furthermore, transient transfection of the 661W cells with a dominant negative IκBαΔN (super-repressor) caused a rapid decline in NF-κB binding activity in the cells, leading to a faster kinetics of photo-oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Down-modulation of NF-κB in these cells appears to be mediated by caspase-1. Our results suggest that NF-κB, which is constitutively expressed in 661W photoreceptor cells, undergoes degradation when subjected to oxidative stress leading to apoptosis of the photoreceptor cells. Thus, the presence of NF-κB in the nucleus is essential for photoreceptor cell survival and protection against oxidative stress induced apoptosis.

GAPDH (chicken anti-rabbit GAPDH immunoaffinity-purified monospecific antibody) was kindly supplied by Drs. Glaser and Cross (34Glaser P.E. Cross R.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12193-12203Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). β-Tubulin, a mouse monoclonal antibody, was from Sigma. Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies either anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG were from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD. Anti-cyclin D1 antibody was against amino acids 1–295, which represents full-length cyclin D1 of human origin, and was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA. The 661W cells were originally isolated from a transgenic mouse line expressing the construct HIT1 comprising of SV40 T-antigen driven by the human interphotoreceptor retinol binding protein promoter (35Al-Ubaidi M.R. Font R.L. Quiambao A.B. Keener M.J. Liou G.I. Overbeek P.A. Baehr W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The construct HIT1 resulted in SV40 T-antigen expression and retinal and brain tumors. 661W cells are routinely grown in complete medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The 661W cells were seeded either in 35/60/100-mm tissue culture dishes or on round coverslips kept in 35-mm dishes and exposed to fluorescent visible light at 4.5 milliwatt/cm2 for varying durations up to 4 h at 37 °C in tissue culture. The accompanying control cells were shielded from light for similar intervals and left in similar conditions as the cells in light-exposed paradigm. The TUNEL procedure as described by Gavrieli et al. (36Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 490-501Crossref Scopus (9100) Google Scholar) was employed to study apoptosis, using a commercially available apoptosis kit (in situ cell death detection kit, Boehringer Mannheim) as per the supplier's instructions. The membrane lipid peroxidation of light-exposed cultured cells was studied by measuring the malonyldialdehyde levels by a colorimetric method involving thiobarbituric acid adduct formation (37Jain S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21340-21345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GSH levels in light-exposed cells was studied by using the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reagent (38Beutler E. Duronand O. Kelley B.M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1963; 61: 882-890PubMed Google Scholar). Protein extracts from 661W cultured cells exposed to light were subjected to immunoblot analysis (39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar, 40Agarwal N. Nir I. Papermaster D.S. J. Neurosci. 1991; 10: 3275-3285Crossref Google Scholar) using specific antibodies for IκBα, p50, and RelA subunit of NF-κB at 1:500 dilution. Cytoplasmic extracts were used for IκBα analysis, whereas nuclear extracts were used to study RelA and p50 subunits of NF-κB. Control blots were run using total cellular extracts and an antibody to GAPDH at 1:1000 dilution. The binding of primary antibodies was detected by using peroxidase labeled appropriate secondary antibodies, which were detected by using diaminobenzidine as substrate. The 661W cells were exposed to light and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The immunofluorescence for p65 subunit of NF-κB was done by using a specific antibody against p65 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (20Agarwal N. Jomary C. Jones S.E. O'Rourke K. Chaitin M.H. Wordinger R.J. Murphy B.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The immunofluorescent cells were photographed using a Nikon Microphot-FXA photomicroscope. The 661W cells were exposed to light for the desired amount of time, and the nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared (41Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were suspended in 100 μl of buffer C (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 15 min. 3 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to the suspension and briefly vortexed. Following this, the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at low speed. The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was collected and stored at −80 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 70 μl of buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was incubated for 20 min at 4 °C followed by a centrifugation at 8000 g for 5 min. The supernatant containing the nuclear protein extract was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations of the cytoplasmic and the nuclear extracts were measured with a detergent-compatible Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB DNA-binding consensus sequence, 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′, and a double-stranded mutant oligonucleotide, 5′-AGT TGAGGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to study the DNA binding activity of NF-κB by EMSA as described (42Shen Y. Rattan V. Sultana C. Kalra V.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1624-H1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For supershift assay, 4 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 1 μg of antibodies for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed by EMSA. The dominant negative IκBα (super-repressor) construct IκBαΔN was obtained from Dr. Dean Ballard, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN (43Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IκBαΔN is a deletion mutant in which the N-terminal 36 amino acids are deleted from the IκBα protein. The 661W cells were transiently transfected with the construct using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), as per the manufacturer's instructions using 8 μl of LipofectAMINE and 5 μg of the IκBα super-repressor plasmid DNA for 1 ml of transfection mix. The untransfected control cells were treated in a similar manner except for the exclusion of the plasmid DNA. The transfected cells and their controls were used 48 h post-transfection for making either total cellular extract for immunoblot analysis or cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts for EMSAs and for TUNEL assay as described above. The 661W cells were exposed to light for up to 4 h, and membrane lipid peroxide formation and GSH levels were measured. There was almost a 2-fold increase in malonyldialdehyde formation following light exposure, as compared with controls (TableI) and inclusion of NAC in the medium before light exposure of cultured cells, prevented the increase in MDA levels (Table I). These results indicate that photic injury to photoreceptor cells occurs due to a possible involvement of an oxidative pathway. To explore this possibility further, we used other anti-oxidants such as thiourea and mannitol in our studies. As shown, photo-oxidative stress resulted in significant lowering of GSH levels as compared with control cells maintained in dark. The presence of thiourea (7 mm) in the medium of 661W cells was protective against photo-oxidative damage, as seen by the maintenance of GSH levels close to control values (Table I).Table IEffect of photo-oxidative stress on malonyldialdehyde formation and glutathione levels in cultured photoreceptor cellsTreatmentMDAGSH levelsnmol/mg proteinμmol/mg proteinControls0.306 ± 0.109 (n = 4)0.0258 ± 0.005 (n = 3)Light-exposed0.598 ± 0.040 (n = 4)aSignificant at p < 0.01.0.010 ± 0.003 (n = 3)aSignificant at p < 0.01.N-Acetylcysteine (2 mm) pretreated and light-exposed0.197 ± 0.067 (n = 4)bSignificant at p < 0.05.NDcND = not determined.Thiourea (7 mm) pretreated and light-exposedND0.037 ± NDThe values are expressed as mean ± S.E. of mean.

Statistical analysis was done by Student's t test. The photoreceptor cells were exposed to light for various time intervals for 15, 30, and 60 min. There was no change in NF-κB activity up to 30 min of light exposure in both the nucleus (Fig. 1 a, lanes 2and 3 for nucleus) and cytoplasm (Fig. 1 a,lanes 6 and 7) compared with dark-exposed control cells (Fig. 1 a, lanes 1 and 5, for nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively). Upon 60 min of light exposure, there was approximately 80% loss of NF-κB binding activity in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (lanes 4 and 8, respectively). These results indicate that the cultured photoreceptor cells express NF-κB constitutively and that the activity of NF-κB decreases on exposure to photo-oxidative stress.Figure 3Immunoblot analysis of NF-κB p50, RelA, IκB α subunit in 661W cells exposed to photo-oxidative stress. The cells were exposed to light for 2 h in presence or absence of NAC (2 mm) and thiourea (7 mm), and the levels of NF-κB subunits p50, RelA, and IκBα subunit were studied by immunoblot analysis. There was a decrease in the levels of IκBα, p50, and RelA subunit of NF-κB upon light exposure (lane 2), and these were protected to varying extents by pretreatment of the cells with NAC and thiourea (lanes 3 and 4), respectively. The GAPDH levels were not altered between the experimental groups studied. “D” and “L” represent dark- and light-exposed 661W cells, respectively. “Nac” and “Thio” indicate N-acetylcysteine and thiourea, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The specificity of the binding of NF-κB was shown by competition with cold NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 1 b, lanes 2–4). As expected, a lack of competition was observed with cold NF-κB mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 1 b, lanes 6–8). The DNA protein complex seen in the EMSA appears to be a heterodimer of p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB, as revealed by a decrease in the binding upon additional incubation with the antibodies to the p65 and p50 (Fig. 1 c) subunits, in a supershift assay. An unrelated antibody, anti-cyclin D1 used as a negative control, did not inhibit the DNA protein complex formation (Fig.1 c). These results confirm the identity of the NF-κB DNA-protein complex seen in the EMSAs. In order to establish the involvement of oxidative damage in the lowering of NF-κB activity during conditions of photo-oxidative stress, we studied the effects of antioxidants, namely NAC, mannitol, and thiourea under these conditions (Fig.2 a). Lanes 1,5, and 9 represent NF-κB binding activity in dark-exposed cells. Lanes 2, 6, and 10represent NF-κB binding activity in dark-exposed cells in the presence of NAC, mannitol, and thiourea, respectively. The presence of these anti-oxidants did not appreciably alter the NF-κB binding activity in dark-exposed control cells. As expected, the activity of NF-κB decreased on exposure to photo-oxidative stress (lanes 3, 7, and 11). The inclusion of NAC, mannitol, and thiourea in the growth medium prior to light exposure partially protected against the down-modulation of NF-κB (Fig.2 a, lanes 4, 8, and 12, respectively) in light-exposed 661W cells. The differences in the extent of protection of NF-κB levels in these groups may be attributed to differences in efficacy of these anti-oxidants in affording protection against photo-oxidative damage. These results indicate that oxidative damage plays a major role in decreasing the NF-κB activity in cultured photoreceptor cells exposed to light. It remains to be seen if these antioxidants offer an additive protection of NF-κB levels, if used simultaneously. Our results so far suggest that light may down-modulate NF-κB through generation of ROIs. To further confirm the role of ROIs in this process we treated the cells with H2O2for various times up to 120 min and measured NF-κB activation and apoptosis. The EMSA revealed no significant change in the NF-κB binding activity in these cells treated with 300 μmH2O2 for 30 and 60 min (Fig. 2 b,lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 6 and 7 for nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, respectively), compared with untreated control cells (lanes 1 and5 for nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively). However, treatment of H2O2 for 120 min resulted in a modest increase in the NF-κB binding activity both in the nucleus (lane 4) and the cytoplasm (lane 8). The TUNEL assay revealed no significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells on treatment with H2O2 compared with untreated controls for all the durations of H2O2treatment (data not shown). Therefore, this data indicate that ROIs alone are not sufficient for light induced down-regulation of NF-κB and activation of apoptosis in these cells. To assess the specificity of response of 661W cells to photo-oxidative stress, we studied the effect of light exposure on MDCK cells, using them as an unrelated control. The light exposure of MDCK cells did not cause a decrease in NF-κB binding activity, in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (data not shown). These results indicate that the cell-specific response of 661W cells to light is different from that of MDCK cells. To further confirm the down-modulation of NF-κB, the protein levels of IκBα, p50, and RelA subunits of NF-κB were studied in 661W cells exposed to light, with or without pretreatment with NAC and thiourea, by immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies. The light-exposed cells showed lowering of IκBα, p50, and RelA subunit of NF-κB, as compared with dark controls. Pretreatment of the cells with both anti-oxidants protected the levels of NF-κB p50, RelA, and IκBα subunits, albeit partially, upon exposure to light (Fig.3). To ensure that light exposure does not result in a generalized protein degradation, a control protein GAPDH was included, which was not greatly altered in all samples under these experimental conditions. On quantitation, there was a ≅50% decrease of IκBα protein levels on 2-h light exposure. On the other hand, there was ≅90% decrease in p50 and RelA subunit with no change in GAPDH levels under similar conditions. Inclusion of anti-oxidants protected to a large extent against degradation of these proteins. IκBα was protected 100%, whereas p50 and p65 were protected to 40–45% of control values. Based on the results of GAPDH protein levels, these data suggest that down-modulation of IκBα and p50 and p65 subunit of NF-κB is not due to random protein degradation. To establish that oxidative damage along with a down-modulation of NF-κB results in apoptosis of these cells, we studied the effect of photo-oxidative stress on apoptosis of these cells in presence or absence of the anti-oxidant, NAC. We found that exposure of 661W cells to light up to 1 h did not result in any significant apoptosis of cultured photoreceptor cells (Fig.4 A).

We have investigated the physiological role of PTP-PEST using Rat1 fibroblast-derived stable cell lines that we have engineered to overexpress PTP-PEST. These cell lines exhibit normal levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the majority of proteins but have significantly lower levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas than control cells. Initial cellular events occurring following integrin-mediated attachment to fibronectin (cell attachment and spreading) are essentially unchanged in cells overexpressing PTP-PEST; similarly, the extent and time course of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in response to integrin engagement is unchanged. In contrast, the reduced phosphorylation state of p130Cas is associated with a considerably reduced rate of cell migration and a failure of cells overexpressing PTP-PEST to accomplish the normally observed redistribution of p130Casto the leading edge of migrating cells. Furthermore, cells overexpressing PTP-PEST demonstrate significantly reduced levels of association of p130Cas with the Crk adaptor protein. Our results suggest that one physiological role of PTP-PEST is to dephosphorylate p130Cas, thereby controlling tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling events downstream of p130Cas and regulating cell migration.

This high degree of selectivity of PTP-PEST for p130Cas is derived from two distinct high affinity interactions. The catalytic domain of PTP-PEST itself displays intrinsic specificity for tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas(11Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell.

Although these observations implicate tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in the control of a variety of cellular processes, the precise role of p130Cas remains largely obscure. The structure of p130Cas suggests that it is involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes via several types of protein-protein interaction. Thus, p130Cas contains an SH3 domain, which has been shown to interact with proline-rich sequences in several proteins (13Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K.

These cells display a specific defect in p130Cas phosphorylation following cell attachment to fibronectin and exhibit a considerably reduced rate of migration. The data suggest that regulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation status of p130Cas by PTP-PEST is a critical control element of cell motility.DISCUSSIONThe results described in this paper suggest that PTP-PEST is a regulator of integrin-mediated movement of fibroblasts across the extracellular matrix via its regulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p130Cas. Although previous reports have suggested a potential involvement of p130Cas in cell motility (50Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our data are the first to reveal a requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in this process. The precise role of p130Cas in controlling cell movement is not clear. However, data recently obtained from mouse embryos lacking the p130Cas protein suggest that it is involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts and cardiocytes (53Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).Integrin-mediated cell movement across the extracellular matrix is a highly dynamic process requiring continual assembly and disassembly of focal contacts, together with extensive remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (54Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 55Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F.

Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Many of the proteins found in focal contacts, including p130Cas, are highly tyrosine-phosphorylated; in fact, focal contacts represent one of the major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation within the cell, as assessed by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-Tyr(P) antibodies (58Maher P.A. Pasquale E.B. Wang J.Y. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6576-6580Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). Furthermore, at least two protein tyrosine kinases, p125FAK and Src, are localized to focal contacts (59Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 60Kaplan K.B. Bibbins K.B. Swedlow J.R. Arnaud M. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4745-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and both kinases have been implicated in the control of cell movement (52Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 62Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a significant role in controlling the assembly and disassembly of focal adhesion complexes, thereby regulating cell motility. However, the control of cell movement is a reversible, dynamic process suggesting that its regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation must involve both kinases and phosphatases. Our results suggest that the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST regulates cell motility by modulating specifically the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas.The observation that p130Cas is localized at the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts suggests a model for the observed effects of PTP-PEST expression on cell movement. By limiting the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas, the ability of p130Cas to interact with appropriate SH2 domain-containing binding partners is impaired in cells overexpressing PTP-PEST. It appears likely that some of these interactions are essential for targeting tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas to the correct cytoskeletal location. Thus, it has been shown that the SH2 domain of v-Crk is required for the v-Crk-induced translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas to a detergent-insoluble fraction (48Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H. Verkleij A.J. Hanafusa H. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in p130Cas-overexpressing COS cells, fibronectin-induced relocation of p130Cas to focal adhesion complexes requires both the SH3 domain of p130Cas (which can bind directly to the focal adhesion kinase p125FAK (25Harte M.T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5501-5509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)) and a C-terminal segment which contains binding sites for the SH2 and SH3 domains of Src (34Nakamoto T.

Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our observation that cells overexpressing PTP-PEST display a defect in the formation of complexes between p130Cas and Crk following fibronectin stimulation (Fig. 5 B) suggests that such complexes are involved in regulating cell movement. Indeed, recent evidence obtained using COS cells transfected with mutant forms of Crk and p130Cassuggested an involvement of p130Cas-Crk complexes in COS cell migration on vitronectin-coated membranes (50Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar).Recently, p130Cas−/− fibroblasts have been reported to display a defect in their response to an activated, transforming variant of the Src tyrosine kinase; they fail to form colonies in soft agar, a defect that can be rescued by re-expression of p130Cas (53Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the involvement of p130Cas in regulating the organization of actin cytoskeleton structures may also influence the response of cells to transforming oncogenes, a suggestion that is supported by several earlier observations implicating a direct regulatory role for p130Cas in cellular transformation (65Auvinen M. Paasinen-Sohns A. Hirai H. Andersson L.C. Holtta E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6513-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 66Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J.

These data further suggest that PTP-PEST may play a key role in suppressing cellular transformation through its ability to dephosphorylate p130Cas. Indeed, such a role is supported by our observation that overexpression of PTP-PEST dramatically influences the location of p130Cas within v-Crk-transformed cells, suggesting that PTP-PEST potentially influences the response of cells to a variety of transforming oncogenes.The results in this paper represent the first description of the physiological role of PTP-PEST. The data suggest that PTP-PEST is involved in controlling the rate of cell movement via the dephosphorylation of p130Cas. Our results also provide new insight into the function of p130Cas in integrin-mediated processes. Thus, it appears that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas is largely dispensable for many of the cellular responses to fibronectin, including cell attachment, cell spreading, and MAP kinase activation. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas is required for the efficient movement of cells across the extracellular matrix and therefore is likely to represent an important mechanism for regulating the dynamic process of cell migration in vivo.

Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that a major role of PTP-PEST is to regulate the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas within the cell. p130Cas was initially identified as a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in cells transformed by the oncogenes v-crk (14Mayer B.J.

In addition, p130Cas is rapidly phosphorylated following mitogenic stimulation by a wide variety of agonists (18Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Song X.H. Mathis S.A. J. Biol.

Although these observations implicate tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in the control of a variety of cellular processes, the precise role of p130Cas remains largely obscure. The structure of p130Cas suggests that it is involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes via several types of protein-protein interaction. Thus, p130Cas contains an SH3 domain, which has been shown to interact with proline-rich sequences in several proteins (13Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K.

In order to investigate further the cellular function of PTP-PEST, we have generated Rat1 fibroblast lines that overexpress the wild-type phosphatase protein. These cells display a specific defect in p130Cas phosphorylation following cell attachment to fibronectin and exhibit a considerably reduced rate of migration. The data suggest that regulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation status of p130Cas by PTP-PEST is a critical control element of cell motility. DISCUSSIONThe results described in this paper suggest that PTP-PEST is a regulator of integrin-mediated movement of fibroblasts across the extracellular matrix via its regulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p130Cas. Although previous reports have suggested a potential involvement of p130Cas in cell motility (50Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our data are the first to reveal a requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in this process. The precise role of p130Cas in controlling cell movement is not clear. However, data recently obtained from mouse embryos lacking the p130Cas protein suggest that it is involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts and cardiocytes (53Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).Integrin-mediated cell movement across the extracellular matrix is a highly dynamic process requiring continual assembly and disassembly of focal contacts, together with extensive remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (54Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 55Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F.

Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Many of the proteins found in focal contacts, including p130Cas, are highly tyrosine-phosphorylated; in fact, focal contacts represent one of the major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation within the cell, as assessed by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-Tyr(P) antibodies (58Maher P.A. Pasquale E.B. Wang J.Y. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6576-6580Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). Furthermore, at least two protein tyrosine kinases, p125FAK and Src, are localized to focal contacts (59Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a significant role in controlling the assembly and disassembly of focal adhesion complexes, thereby regulating cell motility. However, the control of cell movement is a reversible, dynamic process suggesting that its regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation must involve both kinases and phosphatases. Our results suggest that the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST regulates cell motility by modulating specifically the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas.The observation that p130Cas is localized at the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts suggests a model for the observed effects of PTP-PEST expression on cell movement. By limiting the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas, the ability of p130Cas to interact with appropriate SH2 domain-containing binding partners is impaired in cells overexpressing PTP-PEST. It appears likely that some of these interactions are essential for targeting tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas to the correct cytoskeletal location. Thus, it has been shown that the SH2 domain of v-Crk is required for the v-Crk-induced translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas to a detergent-insoluble fraction (48Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H. Verkleij A.J. Hanafusa H. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in p130Cas-overexpressing COS cells, fibronectin-induced relocation of p130Cas to focal adhesion complexes requires both the SH3 domain of p130Cas (which can bind directly to the focal adhesion kinase p125FAK (25Harte M.T.

Our observation that cells overexpressing PTP-PEST display a defect in the formation of complexes between p130Cas and Crk following fibronectin stimulation (Fig. 5 B) suggests that such complexes are involved in regulating cell movement. Indeed, recent evidence obtained using COS cells transfected with mutant forms of Crk and p130Cassuggested an involvement of p130Cas-Crk complexes in COS cell migration on vitronectin-coated membranes (50Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar).Recently, p130Cas−/− fibroblasts have been reported to display a defect in their response to an activated, transforming variant of the Src tyrosine kinase; they fail to form colonies in soft agar, a defect that can be rescued by re-expression of p130Cas (53Honda H.

These results suggest that the involvement of p130Cas in regulating the organization of actin cytoskeleton structures may also influence the response of cells to transforming oncogenes, a suggestion that is supported by several earlier observations implicating a direct regulatory role for p130Cas in cellular transformation (65Auvinen M.

These data further suggest that PTP-PEST may play a key role in suppressing cellular transformation through its ability to dephosphorylate p130Cas. Indeed, such a role is supported by our observation that overexpression of PTP-PEST dramatically influences the location of p130Cas within v-Crk-transformed cells, suggesting that PTP-PEST potentially influences the response of cells to a variety of transforming oncogenes.The results in this paper represent the first description of the physiological role of PTP-PEST. The data suggest that PTP-PEST is involved in controlling the rate of cell movement via the dephosphorylation of p130Cas. Our results also provide new insight into the function of p130Cas in integrin-mediated processes. Thus, it appears that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas is largely dispensable for many of the cellular responses to fibronectin, including cell attachment, cell spreading, and MAP kinase activation. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas is required for the efficient movement of cells across the extracellular matrix and therefore is likely to represent an important mechanism for regulating the dynamic process of cell migration in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2069621752,"P58IPK, a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat and J-domain protein families, was first recognized for its ability to inhibit the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, PKR. PKR is part of the interferon-induced host defense against viral infection, and down-regulates translation initiation via phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 on the α-subunit. P58IPK is activated in response to infection by influenza virus, and inhibits PKR through direct protein-protein interaction. Previously, we demonstrated that the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 40 (hsp40) was a negative regulator of P58IPK. We could now report that influenza virus activates the P58IPKpathway by promoting the dissociation of hsp40 from P58IPKduring infection. We also found that the P58IPK-hsp40 association was disrupted during recovery from heat shock, which suggested a regulatory role for P58IPK in the absence of virus infection. The PKR pathway is even more complex as we show in this report that the molecular chaperone, hsp/Hsc70, was a component of a trimeric complex with hsp40 and P58IPK. Moreover, like other J-domain proteins, P58IPK stimulated the ATPase activity of Hsc70. Taken together, our data suggest that P58IPK is a co-chaperone, possibly directing hsp/Hsc70 to refold, and thus inhibit kinase function. P58IPK, a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat and J-domain protein families, was first recognized for its ability to inhibit the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, PKR. PKR is part of the interferon-induced host defense against viral infection, and down-regulates translation initiation via phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 on the α-subunit. P58IPK is activated in response to infection by influenza virus, and inhibits PKR through direct protein-protein interaction. Previously, we demonstrated that the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 40 (hsp40) was a negative regulator of P58IPK. We could now report that influenza virus activates the P58IPKpathway by promoting the dissociation of hsp40 from P58IPKduring infection. We also found that the P58IPK-hsp40 association was disrupted during recovery from heat shock, which suggested a regulatory role for P58IPK in the absence of virus infection. The PKR pathway is even more complex as we show in this report that the molecular chaperone, hsp/Hsc70, was a component of a trimeric complex with hsp40 and P58IPK. Moreover, like other J-domain proteins, P58IPK stimulated the ATPase activity of Hsc70. Taken together, our data suggest that P58IPK is a co-chaperone, possibly directing hsp/Hsc70 to refold, and thus inhibit kinase function. Viral infection and the stress response have been linked because DnaJ and DnaK were first characterized as accessory factors for λ phage replication in Escherichia coli (1Georgopoulos C. Ang D. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress proteins in biology and medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1990: 191-221Google Scholar). In many cases, viral infection elicits a cellular stress response, similar to heat shock or chemical treatment. This has been demonstrated for vaccinia virus (2Jindal S. Young R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5357-5362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Sindbis virus (3Trgovcich J. Ryman K. Extrom P. Eldridge J.C. Aronson J.F. Johnston R.E. Virology. 1997; 227: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Many viruses also use specific molecular chaperones to aid in viral replication and assembly. For example, hepatitis B virus recruits hsp90 for efficient replication (4Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar,5Hu J. Toft D.O. Seeger C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In addition, vaccinia virus (2Jindal S. Young R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5357-5362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), adenovirus (6Macejak D.G. Luftig R.B. Virology. 1991; 180: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and rabies virus (7Sagara J. Kawai A. Virology. 1992; 190: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) enlist the aid of the molecular chaperone, hsp 1The abbreviations used are: hsp, heat shock protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BD, binding domain; AD, activation domain; T antigen, tumor antigen; pRb, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein./Hsc70, during viral assembly. The group of proteins known as molecular chaperones work together to promote nascent chain folding of proteins during translation, transport, and secretion (reviewed in Ref. 8Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The biology of heat shock proteins and molecular chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1994Google Scholar). Originally characterized as heat shock proteins, they constitute a critical part of the general cellular response to stress (9Becker J. Craig E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 279: 11-23Crossref Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 10Welch W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The bacterial DnaJ and DnaK protein families and their eukaryotic counterparts, hsp40 and hsp/Hsc70, protect cells by refolding proteins that have been denatured as a result of stress (11Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have extended the role of molecular chaperones beyond nascent peptide chain folding and protection from cellular stress. For example, chaperones are required for assembly of steroid receptor complexes (12Pratt W.B. Welsh M.J. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocrine Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar), and are involved in apoptosis (14Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and kinase maturation (15Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.C. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In many cases, molecular chaperones are assisted by a number of proteins, referred to as co-chaperones, which interact in a specific manner with the chaperones to modify their activities (16Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). Our current study suggests that the cellular protein P58IPKmay also be a co-chaperone. P58IPK was originally characterized as an influenza virus-activated protein that inhibits the protein kinase PKR (17Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6208-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14238-14243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of PKR by P58IPK requires direct protein-protein interaction, which is mediated by one of P58IPK's nine tandemly arranged1TPR domains (19Lee T.G. Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tang N.M. Ho C.Y. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28660-28666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). P58IPK also contains a J-domain homology region to DnaJ at its C terminus. Importantly, the J-domain is required for the in vivo inhibition of PKR (20Tang N.M. Ho C.Y. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28660-28666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PKR is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated upon binding double-stranded RNA (21Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15538-15544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase has roles in signal transduction (22Mundschau L.J. Faller D.V. J. Biol.

Kumar K.U. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2416-2423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The best understood role of PKR, however, is its ability to down-regulate mRNA translation via phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (31Gale Jr., M. Katze M.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 78: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This has been characterized most extensively as a host defense against viral infection, but recent studies revealed that the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 of phosphorylation by PKR may also be a general response to cellular stress (32Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Indeed, PKR was activated by heat stress (33Murtha-Riel P. Davies M.V. Scherer B.J. Choi S. Hershey J.W. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12946-12951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Saito S. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 34: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as well as chemical stressors, such as sodium arsenite (35Brostrom C.O. Prostko C.R. Kaufman R.J. Brostrom M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24995-25002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or calcium ionophore (36Prostko C.R. Dholakia J.N. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Work from our laboratory also supported a connection between PKR and the stress response, because we have found that P58IPK directly interacted with hsp40, and was negatively regulated by the molecular chaperone (38Melville M.W. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Welch W.J. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently identified a novel hsp90-related protein, P52rIPK, which is also a negative regulator of P58IPK, suggesting that P58IPK is probably regulated in response to different stress signals (39Gale Jr., M.J. Blakely C.M. Hopkins D.A. Melville M.W. Wambach M. Romano P.R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that P58IPKactivity might also be modulated by stress, perhaps to down-regulate PKR activity once the stress was relieved, and cells begin to recover. In this report, we further define the molecular details and regulation of the hsp40-P58IPK interaction, and for the first time describe a role for hsp/Hsc70 in this increasing complex regulatory pathway. By establishing a role for these molecular chaperones in the regulation of the kinase, we provide a mechanism by which cellular stress can regulate the PKR pathway. Moreover, these findings highlight the molecular interplay between the pathways that regulate the cellular stress response, viral defense, and growth control. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in monolayer cultures at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Cell lysates were prepared from 150-cm2 flasks in 400 μl Buffer A (50 mmHEPES, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The WSN strain of influenza virus was grown and titered as described previously (40Etkind P.R. Krug R.M. J. Virol. 1975; 16: 1464-1475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interferon-treated extracts were prepared as described (41Katze M.G. Tomita J. Black T. Krug R.M. Safer B. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3710-3717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For heat shock experiments, the medium for HeLa cells was replaced with fresh medium at 42 °C. The cultures were incubated at 42 °C for 30 min and then returned to 37 °C. Plasmids expressing glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-P58IPK or GST alone were carried in the Escherichia coli strain BL-21 as described (19Lee T.G. Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-tagged P58IPK and GST alone were prepared as described earlier (19Lee T.G. Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human hsp40 was expressed as full-length protein in E. coli and purified as described (42Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. McKittrick N. Sell S. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7591-7598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stress-inducible form of hsp70 (hsp72) was also expressed in E. coli, and purified as described (43Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The ATPase domain of the constitutive form of hsp70 (Hsc70), referred to as 1-386, was purified as described (43Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiserum to hsp40 was kindly provided by W. Welch (University of California, San Francisco, CA). The anti-hsp70 mouse monoclonal antibody, N27F3-4, was purchased from StressGen (Canada), and used to detect full-length hsp70 (recognizes both hsp70 and Hsc70). The anti-hsp70 mouse monoclonal antibody, 5A5, was purchased from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO), and used to detect the 1-386 protein fragment. Mouse monoclonal antisera to the Gal4 activation domain and Gal4 binding domain were purchased from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). Mouse monoclonal antiserum to actin was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). We used two different GST-pulldown assays for these experiments. The first was used to co-purify hsp40 and hsp70 from whole cell extract with GST-P58IPK or GST as binding substrate. For these experiments, 100 μl of E. coli extract prepared from cells expressing GST-P58IPKor GST alone was incubated with 50 μl of glutathione agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and once in Buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol). 100–250 μg of HeLa cell extract prepared from untreated, influenza virus-infected, or heat-stressed cells was added. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with agitation. Beads were washed twice in Buffer A and 1 mm ATP. Elution of bound proteins was achieved by addition of 30 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, and 50 mm free glutathione. Eluted proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, according to the procedure of Towbin et al. (44Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The filter was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, and hsp40 and hsp70 were detected by Western blot analysis as described earlier (38Melville M.W. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Welch W.J. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms of the Western analyses were scanned using an Epson scanner, and the signal was quantified using ImageQuant software. The second variation of the GST-pulldown used purified proteins, rather than cell extracts, as a source for hsp40, hsp70, and 1-386. Reactions were carried out in 20 μl of Buffer A with proteins at the following concentrations: 2.5 μm GST or GST-P58IPK, 1.75 μm hsp40, and 0.75 μm hsp70 or 1-386. Some reactions also contained ATP at a concentration of 1 mm. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Glutathione-agarose beads were added (20 μl), and reactions were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in Buffer A ± 1 mm ATP, resuspended in 20 μl elution buffer, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Eluted proteins were separated and analyzed as above. The hsp40 yeast expression plasmid was generated by inserting the whole hsp40 coding sequence from an EcoRI digest of hsp40 in pBluescript (Stratagene) into the EcoRI site of pYX222 (Novagen). The ATPase domain of Hsc70 was expressed as a Gal4 binding domain fusion protein in the pGBT10 vector (BD-1-386) (45Irmer H. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2230-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). P58IPK was expressed as a Gal4 activation domain fusion protein as described previously (46Gale Jr., M. Tan S.-L. Wambach M. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4172-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To create pYX-PP1C, an EcoRI -SalI fragment containing the whole PP1C coding sequence was released from pYES2-PP1 2S.-L. Tan and M. G. Katze, unpublished results. and cloned into the corresponding sites of pYX222 (Novagen). hSRP1 was expressed as a Gal4 activation domain fusion in the pGAD424 vector (47Seki T. Tada S. Katada T. Enomoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid plasmids pGBT9 and pGAD424 (CLONTECH) were used for Gal4 DNA binding domain (BD) and Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (AD) fusions, respectively. pGBT9 and pGAD424 contain the selectable auxotrophic markers, TRP1 and LEU2, respectively. BD-P53 was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories. To develop a yeast two-hybrid plus assay, we modified the yeast two-hybrid system by introducing a third protein into the system using the plasmid pYX222. pYX222 contains an HIS3 +selectable marker and is compatible with the two-hybrid plasmids, pGBT10 and pGAD424. Yeast strains SFY526 (CLONTECH) and Y187 (obtained from Dr. S. J. Elledge, Baylor College of Medicine) were used as hosts. MATa strain SFY526 (ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, trp1–901, leu2–3,-112, can r , gal4–542, gal80–538, +URA3::GAL1→lacZ) was cotransformed with BD-1-386, BD-P53 or pGBT9, and with AD-P58IPK, AD-hSRP1, or pGAD424. MATα strainY187 (ura3–52, his3, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, -112, gal4, gal80, +URA3::GAL4→lacZ) was transformed with pYX-hsp40, pYX-PP1C, or pYX222. A mating procedure was used to combine all three plasmids, and the diploids were streaked on synthetic defined plates (Biolol, Vista, CA) lacking Trp, Leu, and His for plasmid selection. The lacZ reporters integrated in the genomes of both strains were used to assess protein-protein interactions based on a β-galactosidase assay as described byCLONTECH Laboratories. Yeast cell extracts were prepared by a glass bead method as described previously (46Gale Jr., M. Tan S.-L. Wambach M. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4172-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ATPase assays were performed as described earlier (43Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). GST-P58IPK and GST were prepared as above, except they were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 before use. 1-386 was used at a final concentration of 0.45 μm, hsp40 was used at 0.9 μm, and GST and GST-P58IPK were used at 3.2 μm. Previously, we found that P58IPK was present in an inactive form in uninfected cells, but was activated upon infection with influenza virus (17Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6208-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14238-14243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently identified the molecular chaperone, hsp40, as a negative regulator of P58IPK, and found that these proteins stably interacted in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (38Melville M.W. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Welch W.J. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that influenza virus activates P58IPK by dissociating it from hsp40, allowing P58IPK to inhibit the antiviral activity of PKR. We therefore evaluated the ability of P58IPK to bind to hsp40 in cell extracts prepared from influenza virus-infected or mock-infected HeLa cells. Using a GST-pulldown approach, we analyzed the binding of recombinant GST-tagged P58IPK to endogenous hsp40. HeLa cells were mock infected, or infected with influenza virus, and cell extracts were prepared at various time points postinfection. Glutathione-agarose beads, precoated with GST-P58IPK, were then added to each extract. The beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted with free glutathione and subjected to SDS-PAGE. hsp40 was detected by Western blotting, and the signal was quantified. We found that hsp40 present in untreated or mock-infected cell extract co-purified with GST-P58IPK (Fig.1). In a parallel experiment using agarose beads precoated with GST alone, hsp40 was not detected (data not shown). In contrast, when GST-P58IPK was reacted with influenza virus-infected extracts there was a transient increase in the amount of hsp40 binding to P58IPK, followed by a dramatic reduction 5 h postinfection. Western blot analysis of the input cell extract confirmed that the loss of hsp40 binding was not because of a reduction in hsp40 protein level (Fig. 1). This finding correlates with our earlier work, which showed that P58IPK was activated in influenza virus-infected cells at 4–5 h postinfection (18Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14238-14243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these results strongly support our hypothesis that P58IPK is activated by influenza virus infection through the dissociation of hsp40. Because there is evidence for an association between viral infection and the stress response, we next examined the effects of heat shock on the ability of P58IPK to bind to hsp40. We used the GST-pulldown approach to examine the ability of P58IPK to bind to hsp40 in extracts prepared from cells subjected to heat shock. Extracts were prepared from HeLa cells that were subjected to a mild heat shock (30 min at 42 °C) and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 0–5 h, or from untreated cells as a control. GST-pulldowns and quantification of bound hsp40 were carried out as described above. We found that the amount of hsp40 bound to P58IPK remained unchanged until 5 h into the recovery period (Fig. 2). At 5 h, there was little hsp40 bound to GST-P58IPK. Again, we confirmed that the changes in hsp40-P58IPKbinding were not because of a loss of hsp40 present in the extract (Fig. 2). These results support the idea that the PKR-P58IPK pathway is regulated similarly in heat-stressed cells and cells infected with influenza virus. Furthermore, these experiments provide evidence that the stress-regulated functions of PKR may be controlled in part by P58IPK. The experiments described above demonstrated that P58IPK and hsp40 bind, but did not rule out the possibility that other factors were mediating the association. The simplest approach to answer this question was to examine purified hsp40 and purified GST-P58IPK, in the absence of other proteins, for the ability to interact. Using the GST-pulldown approach, we found that hsp40 was retained on beads with GST-P58IPK, but not GST or buffer alone (Fig. 3). This evidence strongly suggested that hsp40 and P58IPK are able to interact directly. P58IPK shares structural similarities with hsp70-interactive proteins, such as the co-chaperones Hip, Hop, and Cyp40, all of which contain TPR domains that are required for stable interaction with hsp70 (reviewed in Ref. 48Smith D.F. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We reasoned that because of these similarities with hsp70-interactive proteins, P58IPK might also interact with hsp70. We therefore examined whether P58IPK was able to form a stable complex with hsp70, in the absence or presence of hsp40. Because ATP is known to affect the ability of hsp70 to stably interact with other proteins, we also examined its effect in this assay. GST-P58IPK was incubated with purified recombinant hsp70 (the inducible form) and hsp40, separately or in combination, and the proteins were purified and examined. Western blot analysis demonstrated that in the absence of ATP, there was a weak interaction between hsp70 and P58IPK, which was neither enhanced nor diminished with the addition of hsp40 (Fig.4 A). In the presence of both hsp40 and ATP, however, significantly more hsp70 was bound by GST-P58IPK. In addition, hsp40 also co-purified in the complex. Control experiments confirmed that hsp40 and hsp70 were not similarly purified on GST alone (data not shown). As an initial step to determine whether the P58IPK-hsp70 interaction was limited to the C-terminal refolding domain of hsp70, we repeated the binding experiments using the amino-terminal 44-kDa ATPase domain of Hsc70 (referred to as 1-386). We found that P58IPK also formed a stable complex with 1-386 (Fig. 4 B) and that this interaction was enhanced by ATP and dependent upon hsp40. The ability of ATP to stabilize the complex between 1-386, hsp40, and GST-P58IPK is analogous to the TPR protein Hip, where ATP also enhanced Hip-hsp40-1-386 binding (49Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Similarly, ATP stimulated binding between auxilin and Hsc70 (50Jiang R.-F. Greener T. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 6141-6145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As an independent confirmation of our in vitro binding results, we examined the formation of this trimeric complex in anin vivo environment using the yeast two-hybrid plus system. This is a method to analyze the interaction of three proteins in vivo and quantitatively compares different binding conditions. We expressed P58IPK as a fusion protein with the GAL4 activation domain (AD-P58IPK) and hsp40 as a full-length protein on a different plasmid (pYX-hsp40). The yeast strain SFY526 was co-transformed with both plasmids, and grown on selective medium. The ATPase domain of Hsc70 was expressed as a GAL4 binding domain fusion (BD-1-386) in the yeast strain Y187. The yeast were mated, and progeny were grown on selective medium for maintenance of the three plasmids. These yeast contain a β-galactosidase reporter gene under control of the GAL4 promoter, and the strength of the hybrid protein interaction is measured by β-galactosidase activity. Western blotting analysis of each yeast transformant confirmed that each protein was expressed at similar levels (Fig. 5 B). We found that the P58IPK-1-386 interaction was stimulated approximately 6-fold in the presence of hsp40 (compare lanes 1 and 4). Moreover, the interaction was specific to the ATPase domain of Hsc70, which supports the results of our in vitro binding experiments. It is interesting to note that the amount of P58IPK-1-386 binding in the absence of hsp40 was the same as background (compare lane 4 to lanes 2, 3, and 5). This suggests that the endogenous yeast DnaJ protein, Ydj-1 did not substitute for hsp40 in this interaction, further corroborating the specificity of the P58IPK-hsp40-1-386 interaction. Our results, which show that P58IPK interacted with the ATPase domain of Hsc70, suggested that the interaction might have a functional consequence. As is evident with most J-domain proteins that interact with the ATPase domain of Hsc70 to regulate ATPase activity. This has been demonstrated for hsp40, Hdj-2, Hsj-1, auxilin, and most other J-domain proteins (reviewed in Ref. 51Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that P58IPK could also stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70. For these experiments, we used the ATPase fragment of Hsc70 alone (1-386), which retains ATPase activity even in the absence of the C-terminal refolding domain (43Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). P58IPKstimulated this activity in a dose-dependent manner, and to the same degree as observed for hsp40 (Fig.6). Furthermore, when combined in the same reaction, hsp40 and P58IPK displayed an additive effect, which suggested that the proteins do not work synergistically. Control experiments using GST alone confirmed that the stimulation was not because of contaminating E. coli proteins present in the purified preparation (data not shown). As a control, we verified that the GST-P58IPK preparation contained no significant endogenous ATPase activity (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that P58IPK, like other J-domain proteins, is able to specifically interact with and stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70. Co-chaperones are defined on the basis of their ability to interact with molecular chaperones and to modify their activity or provide specificity. Thus, the ability of P58IPK to bind to Hsc70 and stimulate the ATPase activity indicates that P58IPK is a novel member of the co-chaperones. Although we have not yet determined whether P58IPK's ability to regulate Hsc70 directly plays a role in the inhibition of PKR, recent studies of two other proteins provide examples of J-domain co-chaperones that recruit Hsc70 to specific protein targets. First is the clathrin-uncoating factor, auxilin, which contains a C-terminal J-domain homology region. The J-domain is required for the clathrin-uncoating activity of auxilin, as well as interaction with Hsc70 (50Jiang R.-F. Greener T. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 6141-6145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 52King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4067-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The current hypothesis is that auxilin targets Hsc70 to specific sites on the clathrin basket and stimulates the chaperone to refold the clathrin molecule, and thus uncoat the vesicle (53Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19594-19600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Indeed, deletion of the J-domain of auxilin abrogates clathrin uncoating (54Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E.H. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the clathrin-uncoating activity can be blocked by other J-domain proteins, such as yeast Ydj-1 and human Hsj-1 (52King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4067-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 55Cheetham M.E. Anderton B.H. Jackson A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Presumably, this is because these general chaperones do not contain a clathrin-binding domain, and thus compete with auxilin for Hsc70. The second co-chaperone is the tumor antigen (T antigen) of the polyomavirus, simian virus 40, which has a J-domain at its NH2 terminus. Work by Kelley and Georgopoulos (56Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) showed that the T antigen J-domain could functionally substitute for the J-domain in DnaJ of E. coli. More recently, a reciprocal experiment found that the J-domain from Hsj-1 could functionally substitute for the T antigen J-domain (57Zalvide J. Stubdal H. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1408-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The T antigen also contains a binding site for the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb), which the T antigen may inactivate through direct protein-protein interaction. However, recent reports demonstrate that the J-domain of the T antigen is critical for the inactivation of pRb and malignant transformation (58Harris K.F. Christensen J.B. Radany E.H. Imperiale M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1746-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Srinivasan et al. (59Srinivasan A. McClellan A.J. Vartikar J. Marks I. Cantalupo P. Li Y. Whyte P. Rundell K. Brodsky J.L. Pirhonen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4761-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) proposed that the T antigen targets Hsc70 to pRb and stimulates the chaperone to alter the conformation of pRb. This tenet is supported by a report showing that a functional J-domain in the T antigen is critical for the accumulation of free E2F and activation of E2F promoter sequences (58Harris K.F. Christensen J.B. Radany E.H. Imperiale M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1746-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, the T antigen and auxilin systems highlight the potential of J-domain co-chaperone proteins to target specific proteins for refolding by hsp70. We showed in this study that hsp40 and P58IPK associate in extracts prepared from HeLa cells and that binding was disrupted by infection with influenza virus (Fig. 1). We are not certain of the significance of the increased hsp40 binding to GST-P58IPK immediately upon influenza virus infection. Perhaps hsp40 is released from other regulatory pathways, thus increasing the pool of hsp40 available to bind to GST-P58IPK. The interaction between hsp40 and P58IPK also was abrogated during recovery from heat shock, suggesting P58IPK may have roles in the general stress response (Fig. 2). We observed no increase in hsp40 binding to P58IPK immediately following heat shock compared with influenza virus-infected cells. However, the same conclusion could be drawn: hsp40 was released from other regulatory pathways, but in heat-shocked cells hsp40 was recruited by hsp70 to bind to denatured proteins. The interaction between P58IPK and hsp40 was direct, requiring no other binding partners (Fig. 3). P58IPK binding to hsp70, however, required both ATP and hsp40. Significantly, the interaction was specific to the ATPase domain of Hsc70, indicating that the complex was not merely an intermediate step in a refolding reaction (Fig. 4). Therefore, we propose in our revised model that P58IPK is inactive before heat shock or influenza virus infection because it is bound to its own inhibitor, hsp40 (Fig.7). In response to a stress event, such as heat shock or virus infection, P58IPK then binds to hsp/Hsc70. Our in vitro binding results indicate that hsp40 may be required for the association of hsp/Hsc70, and there might exist a trimeric hsp40-P58IPK-hsp/Hsc70 complex (Fig. 4). However, given our earlier results showing that hsp40 impairs the ability of P58IPK to inhibit PKR, hsp40 likely dissociates before P58IPK binds to PKR. The mechanism of the release of P58IPK by hsp40 is unclear. It is possible that the cellular stress response triggered by heat shock or influenza virus infection recruits hsp40, along with the other stress response proteins, to participate in the general protection of the cell, and thus free sufficient P58IPK to down-regulate PKR. Alternatively, the chaperone is modified in some way, so that it is no longer able to bind to P58IPK. Regardless of the cause of the release of P58IPK, the final step in the PKR pathway is the inhibition of PKR. We speculate that P58IPK brings hsp/Hsc70 to PKR, and stimulates the chaperone to refold, and thus inactivate the kinase. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that P58IPK stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsc70. The inhibition of PKR ensures that translation will not be impaired in the case of influenza virus infection, or that it will be restored in the case of recovery from heat stress. We acknowledge the speculative nature of the model and emphasize that we present it as merely a hypothesis and a guideline for future studies. Previously, we have shown that P58IPK inhibited PKR in a stoichiometric manner by direct protein-protein interaction. Our studies also showed that the 6th TPR domain was required for direct interaction with PKR, and inhibition of the kinase. Furthermore, Tanet al. (60Tan S.-L. Gale Jr., M.J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2431-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) demonstrated that P58IPK binding to PKR prevents dimerization of the kinase, which is a required step for full catalytic activity. Interestingly, monomerization of the E. coli P1 replication initiator RepA requires a functional DnaK-DnaJ system (61Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7903-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 62Wickner S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), thus implicating another J-domain protein in the disruption of protein multimers. Just as most J-domain proteins require their hsp70/Hsc70 counterpart, the requirement of P58IPKfor its J-domain to inhibit PKR in vivo supports the notion that hsp/Hsc70 may be involved in P58IPK activity. As indicated in Fig. 7, we have identified a second negative regulator of P58IPK, called P52rIPK, which also binds to and inhibits P58IPK (39Gale Jr., M.J. Blakely C.M. Hopkins D.A. Melville M.W. Wambach M. Romano P.R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This is particularly interesting in the context of molecular chaperones, because P52rIPKcontains a region of homology to hsp90. The conditions under which P52rIPK and P58IPK interact within the cell, however, and the consequences of this interaction, remain to be determined. These findings are significant for the study of P58IPKbecause they demonstrate the likely mechanism by which influenza virus activates P58IPK, namely by disrupting the complex between P58IPK and its negative regulator, hsp40. Furthermore, this report is the first evidence of a role for P58IPK in the absence of influenza virus infection, as evidenced by the liberation of P58IPK during recovery from heat shock, and the co-chaperone activity of P58IPK. We conclude that the cell may regulate the ability of PKR to mediate antiviral activity, growth suppression, signal transduction, and translational control by balancing the activities of hsp40, hsp/Hsc70, P58IPK, and possibly P52rIPK.

https://openalex.org/W2002178602,"Rat serum mannose-binding protein (MBP-A) functions as part of the innate immune system by targetting complement toward potentially pathogenic microorganisms. In order to examine the molecular basis for complement activation, rat MBP-A has been overproduced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Recombinant protein is post-translationally modified in the same way as the native lectin. Hydrodynamic studies indicate that MBP-A consists predominantly of covalent oligomers containing one to four copies of a subunit that comprises a trimer of polypeptides. These oligomers are non-interconverting and do not assemble into higher order structures at concentrations in excess of those normally found in serum. Disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues at the N-terminal end of the collagen-like domain link polypeptides to form covalent oligomers. Analysis of wild-type MBP-A and MBP-A containing the substitution Cys6 → Ser suggests that polypeptides within each trimeric structural unit are mostly linked by disulfide bonds between cysteine residues at positions 13 and 18 arranged in an asymmetrical configuration. Disulfide bonds involving Cys6 connect polypeptides within separate trimers. Analysis of chimeras between MBP-A and rat liver MBP (MBP-C) indicates that residues within the N-terminal region of the collagenous domain and the cysteine-rich domain of MBP-A enable assembly of trimers into higher order oligomers. The activity of MBP-A in a hemolytic complement fixation assay using mannan-coated sheep erythrocytes was approximately 20-fold greater than the activity of MBP-C. Analysis of the MBP chimeras and isolated oligomers of MBP-A reveals that the larger oligomers are more efficient at complement activation. These data indicate that the overall complement fixing activity of MBP-A is a function of the individual molecular activities of oligomers and their relative abundance within the serum.

Immunol. 1990; 79: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It also functions directly as an opsonin by binding to specific receptors on the surfaces of phagocytic cells (3Kuhlman M. Joiner K. Ezekowitz R.A.B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1733-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Serum MBP is a member of the collectin family of animal lectins. Each collectin polypeptide contains an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, a collagen-like domain, an α-helical coiled-coil neck region and a C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) (4Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Complement fixation by serum MBP occurs by a mechanism similar to the classical pathway of complement activation. MBP interacts with two MBP-associated serine proteases (MASP-1 and MASP-2) (5Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 6Takahashi A.

On activation, MASP-2 cleaves both C4 and C2 to form a C4b2a complex with C3 convertase activity (8Ji Y.H. Fujita T. Hatsuse H. Takahashi A. Matsushita M. Kawakami M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 571-578PubMed Google Scholar). Human MBP deficiency is a relatively common disorder caused by point mutations in the MBP gene (9Super M. Thiel S. Lu J. Levinsky R.J. Turner M.W. Lancet. 1989; ii: 1236-1239Abstract Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 10Sumiya M. Super M. Tabona P. Levinsky R.J. Takayuki A. Turner M.W. Summerfield J.A. Lancet. 1991; 337: 1569-1570Abstract PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). This condition is associated with a high susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections particularly during the first few years of life. Two distinct rat mannose-binding proteins, MBP-A and MBP-C, have been cloned and sequenced (11Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are found predominantly in the serum and liver, respectively. The two forms adopt distinct higher order structures (4Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). MBP-C consists of a single trimer of polypeptides whereas MBP-A assembles into higher oligomers. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of human MBP suggest the presence of oligomers ranging from dimers to hexamers of trimeric subunits (12Lu J. Thiel S. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Reid K.B.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2287-2294PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lipscombe R.J. Sumiya M. Summerfield J.A. Turner M.W. Immunology. 1995; 85: 660-667PubMed Google Scholar). The trimeric building blocks from which MBPs are assembled will subsequently be referred to as subunits. The MBP oligomers adopt a bouquet-like structure, similar to complement component C1q (12Lu J. Thiel S. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Reid K.B.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2287-2294PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of each subunit in MBPs occurs in a C- to N-terminal direction (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), so that association of the CRDs and trimerization of the α-helical coiled-coil region enables formation of the collagen triple helix. The collagen-like domain contains 4-hydroxyproline and 5-hydroxylysine residues, which are further derivatized to form glucosylgalactosyl-5-hydroxylysine (11Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Colley K.J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10290-10295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MBP-A and MBP-C each contain a single break in the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat pattern within the collagenous domain (11Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interruption is thought to introduce a kink or region of flexibility into the protein, which in MBP-A enables the trimeric stems to angle away from the central core of the bouquet-like structure. The polypeptides are linked by cysteine residues within the N-terminal domain which form disulfide bonds within and between subunits in the larger MBP-A structures (11Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of a fragment of the trimeric MBP-A subunit containing the CRD and neck region, the CRDs of each trimer are clustered such that the binding sites are orientated in a configuration to enable binding to bacterial and fungal cell surfaces (16Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used the relatively simple structure of MBP-C to examine the organization of its more complex serum homolog. Biophysical analysis of chimeras of MBP-A and MBP-C indicate that oligomers of MBP-A assemble as a result of the interactions of residues in the cysteine-rich domain and N-terminal part of the collagen-like domain. The presence of these regions of MBP-A also correlates with the level of complement fixing activity, indicating that correct assembly of MBP-A is essential for its biological roles.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Standard molecular biology techniques were carried out as described (19Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The presence of free thiol groups was determined as described previously (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MBP-A was produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells using a strategy similar to that previously described for MBP-C (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding MBP-A (11Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was modified to introduce an XhoI restriction site adjacent to the EcoRI site at the 5′ end and a SalI site near the BstYI site (base 835) in the 3′-untranslated region. This fragment was ligated into the unique SalI restriction site upstream of the dihydrofolate reductase gene in the vector pED (20Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Chimeric constructs were made using restriction sites that are common to the MBP-A and MBP-C cDNAs or by inserting synthetic oligonucleotide linkers between appropriate restriction sites. Chinese hamster ovary cell transfectants were generated and selected as described previously (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 225-cm2 tissue culture flasks containing 70 ml of medium supplemented with 0.5 μm methotrexate and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum in which endogenous bovine lectins had been removed by passage through a 1-ml mannose-Sepharose column. Once the cells were confluent, the medium was replaced daily. Medium was harvested every day beginning 4 days after confluence was reached. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (4000 × g for 4 min) and the medium was stored at −80 °C. MBP was isolated following the method previously used for MBP-C (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For complement assays, protein was isolated from serum-free medium. Two days after cell confluence was reached, the medium from each tissue culture flask was replaced with 70 ml of CHO-S-SFM II without nucleosides supplemented with 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.55, and 0.5 μm methotrexate. This medium was harvested daily from 4 days after confluence and MBP-A was purified as described above. MBP-A was purified from the culture medium of confluent cells, since this procedure yielded protein which resembles preparations of the native lectin (21Yokota Y. Arai T. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem.

Protein isolated from the medium of subconfluent cells was also found to have a reduced apparent molecular mass, which may reflect changes in post-translational modification. Oligomers of MBP-A and MBP-A Cys6 → Ser were resolved by ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 50 mmTris, pH 8.2, containing 10 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 25 °C. Oligomers were eluted from the column using a 500 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer over 45 min. The absorbance was monitored at 280 nm and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Gel-filtration chromatography was carried out on a Biosep Sec-S3000 column (300 × 7.8 mm, Phenomenex) equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out as described previously for MBP-C (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Values reported are mean ± S.D. for at least two independent experiments. The partial specific volume of MBP-A (0.7208 ml/g) was calculated from the amino acid and carbohydrate composition using the method of Cohn and Edsall (22Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold, New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar). For thermolysin and chymotrypsin digestion, MBP-A was incubated with 10–20% (w/w) of enzyme in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 25 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were separated on a 17.5% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for sequence analysis (23Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin digestion of MBP-A was carried out in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mmCaCl2, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. MBP-A (1 mg) was incubated with trypsin (5% w/w) at 37 °C with mixing for 18 h. The reaction mixture was passed through a mannose-Sepharose column equilibrated in reaction buffer without dithiothreitol to remove the CRDs. The peptide mixture was lyophilized to dryness, resuspended in 20% acetic acid (200 μl), and applied to a C3 reverse-phase column. Subtilisin digestion of N-terminal tryptic fragments, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and MALDI-MS were performed as described previously (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Complement fixation activity was determined by measuring MBP-dependent hemolysis of mannan-coated erythrocytes, using a slightly modified version of the assay described by Ikeda et al. (1Ikeda K. Sannoh T. Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7451-7454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For coating of sheep erythrocytes with mannan by the chromium chloride method (24Perucca P.J. Faulk W.P. Fudenberg H.H. J. Immunol. 1969; 102: 812-820PubMed Google Scholar), 4 × 1010 cells were washed three times by centrifugation (2000 × g for 2 min) and resuspended in 10 ml of Veronal-buffered saline, pH 7.3, (4.4 mm barbituric acid, 1.8 mm sodium barbitone, 145 mm NaCl). Aliquots of mannan (5 ml at 100 μg/ml) were mixed with 5 ml of erythrocytes (1 × 1010 cells) and 5 ml of CrCl3·6H20 (0.5 mg/ml) in Veronal-buffered saline and incubated with mixing for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 ml of ice-cold gelatin-Veronal buffer (Veronal buffer containing 0.1% gelatin, 5 mmCaCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2). The mannan-coated erythrocytes were washed three times in the same buffer and resuspended at 1 × 109 cells/ml. MBP-depleted serum was prepared by passing guinea pig serum (15 ml) through two mannose-Sepharose columns (1 ml), equilibrated in Veronal-buffered saline containing 10 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C. In addition, prior to setting up each complement assay, serum (1 ml) was incubated with mannan-coated erythrocytes (2 × 108cells) for 1 h at 37 °C to remove any remaining endogenous lectins. Complement fixation assays were performed in duplicate. Aliquots (0.4 ml) of MBP were incubated with 0.1 ml of cells (1 × 108 cells) for 1 h in gelatin-Veronal buffer at 25 °C. The cells were washed with 0.5 ml of buffer and incubated with MBP-depleted guinea pig serum in a total volume of 0.5 ml for 1 h with mixing at 37 °C. Sufficient guinea pig serum was used to give complete lysis when incubated with 1 μg of MBP-A. Gelatin-Veronal buffer (700 μl) was added to each sample and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The absorbance was measured at 541 nm and expressed as a percentage of the absorbance of an equivalent volume of cells totally lysed in water, correcting for lysis observed in the absence of MBP. The data were fitted to a sigmoidal curve using Microcal Origin. Relative complement fixing activities were calculated from the concentrations of MBP required for 50% hemolysis compared with MBP-A in assays performed using the same batch of mannan-coated erythrocytes. Values reported are the mean ± S.E. for at least three independent assays. Mannose-binding protein has generally been purified from mammalian sera by affinity chromatography on immobilized mannan or invertase, or on columns of mannose linked to agarose (25Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 26Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem.

Biophys. 1988; 260: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The purified protein consists of multiple covalent species detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Rat MBP-A comprises three major covalent forms which have been interpreted as dimers, trimers, and tetramers of the trimeric polypeptide (21Yokota Y. Arai T. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Quantities of MBP-A sufficient to enable a detailed study of its structural organization were produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Typical yields of 1.5–2.5 mg from 500 ml of serum-supplemented medium and 0.5–1 mg from 500 ml of serum-free medium were obtained. In contrast, yields reported from serum preparations range from 0.02 to 0.5 mg for human MBP (12Lu J. Thiel S. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Reid K.B.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2287-2294PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and 0.2 mg for rat MBP-A (27Oka S. Ikeda K. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) from an equivalent volume of serum. MBP-A purified from the expression system is not contaminated with other serum lectins as has been reported for serum preparations (27Oka S. Ikeda K. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequencing of MBP-A revealed that the signal sequence is processed correctly (11Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MALDI-MS profile of reduced MBP-A is consistent with a single species of mass 24,730 Da. This value is considerably greater than the calculated mass based on the amino acid sequence (23,526.4 Da), indicating that the polypeptide has undergone extensive post-translational modification (11Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis revealed 4-hydroxyproline and 5-hydroxylysine contents of 1.6 and 1.8 mol %, respectively. These data are consistent with 3.5 residues of 4-hydroxyproline and 4.0 residues of 5-hydroxylysine for each polypeptide chain. Examination of the amino acid sequence of MBP-A indicates that most of the potential sites for hydroxylation must be fully derivatized since there are four sites for both proline and lysine hydroxylation, within the consensus sequences Gly-X-Pro and Gly-X-Lys. These results are consistent with previous studies in which both 4-hydroxyproline and 5-hydroxylysine have been detected in preparations of the native lectin (11Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of the intact protein and of chymotrypsin and thermolysin fragments indicate that Pro44, Pro50, and Pro56 are fully derivatized, since only phenylthiohydantoin-4-hydroxyproline was detected at these positions (Fig. 1). However, Pro33 was found to be unmodified, since only phenylthiohydantoin-proline is detected in the 33rd sequence cycle of Edman degradation of the intact polypeptide. These results were confirmed by MALDI-MS and N-terminal sequencing of tryptic peptides of MBP-A separated by reverse-phase chromatography. Peptide Gly39-Lys46 elutes in the unbound fraction from the reverse-phase column and peptide Leu47-Arg68 elutes as a single peak from the column. The masses of these peptides are consistent with complete hydroxylation of Pro44, Pro50, and Pro56. The peptide Asp24-Arg38 also elutes as a single peak from the reverse-phase column. However, the mass of this peptide indicates that Pro33 is unmodified, confirming the sequencing data. This residue occurs immediately before the break in the collagen consensus sequence. Previous studies have shown that the proline residue at the corresponding position in MBP-C is only partially hydroxylated (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MALDI-MS analysis of peptides purified from trypsin digests of MBP-A indicates that the 4 lysine residues within the consensus sequence for hydroxylation are at least partially modified. In each case, the mass of the peptide is consistent with further derivitization of the hydroxylysine residue by the addition of 2 hexose units. In addition, no phenylthiohydantoin-derivative could be detected at these positions by N-terminal sequencing suggesting glycosylation (28Butler W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 339-346Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Glucosylgalactosyl 5-hydroxylysine has previously been identified in preparations of MBP (15Colley K.J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10290-10295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional minor peaks were observed in the spectra of glycosylated peptides observed by MALDI-MS analysis. The masses were consistent with the loss of single hexose units (−162.1 Da). However, it is not clear whether these peaks reflect heterogeneity of the sample or occur as a result of the ionization/desorption process. Altogether, the post-translational modifications of MBP-A produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells account for the increased mass of the MBP-A polypeptide determined by MALDI-MS. These modifications, which are characteristic of those found in vertebrate collagens, are consistent with those previously reported for protein purified from rat serum. Recombinant MBP-A, when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, migrates as four major bands with apparent molecular masses of 85, 185, 280, and 355 kDa (Fig.2 B). Similar bands were detected in preparations of protein purified by affinity chromatography and in radiolabeled material immunoprecipitated using an antibody specific for the CRD of MBP-A. 2R. Dodd, E. Leamy, R. Wallis, and K. Drickamer, unpublished observations. These findings indicate that multiple covalent forms of MBP-A are secreted from the cells and are not created by rearrangement of disulfide bonds during the purification procedure. Under reducing conditions, MBP-A migrates as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa. Thus, the bands observed under nonreducing conditions are compatible with the presence of disulfide-linked monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers of subunits, with dimers and trimers being the most abundant covalent forms. The composition and ratio of multimers is consistent with previous studies of MBP-A purified from rat serum (21Yokota Y. Arai T. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the apparent molecular masses of the trimer and tetramer are beyond the range of the molecular weight markers, the identities of the these species were confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (see below). Minor peaks could be observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels overloaded with MBP-A under nonreducing conditions. The apparent molecular masses of 26, 45, 122, 155, 226, 255, 310, and 340 kDa are consistent with the presence of low levels of intermediate covalent forms comprising 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 polypeptide chains, respectively. MBP-A analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography elutes at several positions: a well resolved peak with an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa and three overlapping peaks with apparent molecular masses in the range 450–800 kDa (Fig. 2 A). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of fractions collected across the gel-filtration profile indicates that the larger covalent species elute as multiple overlapping peaks from the column (Fig. 2 B). The order of elution corresponds to the molecular mass of each covalent oligomer. The elution profile of MBP-A is similar over the entire range of concentrations examined (up to 1 mg/ml). There was no evidence of assembly of the four major oligomers to form more complex, higher order structures. The elution of intermediate covalent forms of MBP-A on gel-filtration chromatography indicates that in some cases the three polypeptides in the trimeric subunits are not covalently linked to each other. For example, small amounts of monomeric and dimeric MBP-A polypeptide elute at the same position as the covalent trimeric subunit, suggesting the presence of some noncovalent monomeric subunits (Fig. 2 B). Similar heterogeneity has been observed in preparations of MBP-C, which consists of both covalent and noncovalent trimers of polypeptide chains (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previous studies have revealed that collectins show anomalous behavior on gel-filtration because of the highly extended conformation of the molecules, which in turn is due to the presence of a triple-helical collagen-like domain (13Lipscombe R.J. Sumiya M. Summerfield J.A. Turner M.W. Immunology. 1995; 85: 660-667PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For this reason, analytical ultracentrifugation was used to determine the accurate mass of oligomers of MBP-A, independent of shape. The equilibrium distribution of purified MBP-A at loading concentrations of up to 1 mg/ml is consistent with a non-interacting heterogeneous mixture (data not shown). The apparent molecular mass as a function of concentration increases throughout the sample cell. However, the data for different loading concentrations, rather than overlapping as would be expected for a self-associating system, show similar apparent molecular mass distributions. Furthermore, the apparent weight-averaged molecular mass is dependent on the rotor speed, since a systematic decrease"

Because the α-sarcin loop has been placed near the peptidyltransferase center in Escherichia coli ribosomes, we investigated the effects of alterations at the peptidyltransferase center on the activity of PAP. We demonstrate here that a chromosomal mutant of yeast, harboring the mak8–1 allele of peptidyltransferase-linked ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3), is resistant to the cytostatic effects of PAP. Unlike wild-type yeast, ribosomes from mak8–1 cells are not depurinated when PAP expression is induced in vivo, indicating that wild-type L3 is required for ribosome depurination. Co-immunoprecipitation studies show that PAP binds directly to L3 or Mak8–1p in vitro but does not physically interact with ribosome-associated Mak8–1p. L3 is required for PAP to bind to ribosomes and depurinate the 25 S rRNA, suggesting that it is located in close proximity to the α-sarcin loop. These results demonstrate for the first time that a ribosomal protein provides a receptor site for an ribosome-inactivating protein and allows depurination of the target adenine.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). PAP displays broad-spectrum antiviral activity against plant and animal viruses, including influenza virus (3Tomlinson J.A. Walker V.M. Flewett T.H. Barclay G.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1974; 22: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), poliovirus (4Ussery M.A. Irvin J.D. Hardesty B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1977; 284: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), herpes simplex virus (5Aron G.M. Irvin J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1980; 17: 1032-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and human immunodeficiency virus (6Zarling J.M. Moran P.A. Haffar O. Sias J. Richman D.D. Spina C.A. Myers D.E. Kuelbeck V. Ledbetter J.A. Uckun F.M. Nature. 1990; 347: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). PAP removes an adenine base by cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond at A4324 in rat 28 S rRNA and at homologous sites on ribosomes from other organisms. Ribosomes depurinated in this manner are unable to bind the eEF-2·GTP complex, and protein synthesis is blocked at the translocation step (7Montanaro L. Sperti S. Mattioli A. Testoni G. Stirpe F. Biochem. J. 1975; 146: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Osborn R.W. Hartley M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We previously reported that in vivo induction of PAP expression in yeast had a cytostatic effect. Growth was strongly inhibited when PAP expression was induced, possibly because of inhibition of translation (9Hur Y. Hwang D.-J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because ribosomal frameshifting occurs during the elongation phase of protein synthesis, we investigated the role of translocation inhibition by PAP in programmed ribosomal frameshifting by utilizing two different viral systems (the L-A and M1“killer” system and the Ty1 retrotransposable element) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrated that expression of PAP in yeast leads to specific inhibition of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in the +1 direction and interferes with the ability of Ty1 to retrotranspose (10Tumer N.E. Parikh B.A. Li P. Dinman J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rRNA substrate for PAP, the α-sarcin loop, has been localized in close proximity to the peptidyltransferase center within the 50 S subunit of Escherichia coli ribosomes (11Muralikrishna P. Alexander R.W. Cooperman B.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4562-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that yeast cells harboring mutations in ribosomal proteins that have been linked to the peptidyl transfer reaction may be resistant to the cytostatic effects of PAP. One of these mutants, mak8–1, was discovered by its inability to maintain the M1satellite virus (12Wickner R.B. Liebowitz M.J. Genetics. 1974; 76: 423-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mak8–1 is an allele ofRPL3/TCM1 (13Wickner R.B. Porter-Ridley S. Fried H.M. Ball S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4706-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which encodes the large ribosomal subunit protein L3 (14Fried H.M. Warner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). L3 has been shown to participate in the formation of the peptidyltransferase center (15Hampl H. Schulze H. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2284-2288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Noller H.F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5297-5300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and identified as an essential protein in the catalysis of peptide bond formation (17Green R. Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 679-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Recent results indicate that strains harboring the mak8–1 allele ofRPL3 exhibit increased programmed frameshifting efficiencies, supporting the notion that events at the peptidyltransferase center play a critical role in programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (18Peltz S.W. Hammell A.B. Cui Y. Yasenchak J. Puljanowski L. Dinman J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The current study demonstrates for the first time that ribosomal protein L3 is essential for binding of PAP to ribosomes and subsequent depurination of the α-sarcin loop, providing direct evidence that PAP accesses its rRNA substrate by binding to a ribosomal protein. The cDNAs encoding PAP (NT188) and PAPx (NT224) were introduced asSmaI/BglII fragments into the yeast expression vector YEp351. PAPx is an active-site mutant of PAP with a point mutation (E176V) that abolishes enzymatic activity (9Hur Y. Hwang D.-J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Transcription of the cDNAs was under the control of a galactose-inducibleGAL1 promoter. Vectors containing PAP or PAPx were transformed (19Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the yeast strains S. cerevisiae W303 (MATa, ade2–1 trp1–1 ura3–1 leu2–3, 112 his3–11, 15 can1–100), 1906 (MATa, leu2 mak8–1), or the isogenic strains JD980 (MATα lys2 his3 ura3 leu2Δ trp1Δ RPL3Δ::hisG), containing either pRPL3 or pmak8–1 (18Peltz S.W. Hammell A.B. Cui Y. Yasenchak J. Puljanowski L. Dinman J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). YEp351 transformed into all cell types was used as a negative control. Yeast cells were grown in 300 ml of H-Leu medium (20Treco D.A. Lundblad V. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley, Cambridge, MA1993Google Scholar) with 2% raffinose at 30 °C to an A 600 = 0.6. Aliquots for protein analysis (2 ml), RNA extraction (15 ml), and ribosome isolation (25 ml) were removed and pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × gfor 5 min. The remaining culture was pelleted at the same speed, washed in H-Leu medium, and resuspended in H-Leu medium with 2% galactose to induce the expression of PAP and PAPx. At various times during induction (2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h), aliquots were removed, pelleted, and stored at −80 °C. Pellets for ribosome isolation were washed twice in water and quickly frozen in liquid N2. RNA from a frozen yeast aliquot was extracted according to Cui et al. (21Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Peltz S.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5726-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Total RNA from the time point aliquot of PAP and PAPx induced inmak8–1 cells was used in the RNase protection assay as described in Tumer et al. (10Tumer N.E. Parikh B.A. Li P. Dinman J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen pellets of a 2-ml aliquot of cells harvested during the time course induction of PAP and PAPx were resuspended in an equal volume of cold (4 °C) phosphate-buffered saline buffer and 0.3 g of 0.5-mm diameter glass beads. Cells were vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatant total protein was quantified by Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total protein (30 μg) from each time point was separated through 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with either an affinity-purified (22Lindstrom J.T. Belanger F.C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) polyclonal antibody to PAP (1:5000) or a monoclonal antibody to L3 (anti TCM 7.1.1, gift of J. R. Warner) (1:5000). PAP and L3 were visualized by chemiluminescence using a Renaissance kit (NEN Life Science Products). To probe proteins with two separate antibodies, blots were stripped by incubation in 8m guanidine hydrochloride at room temperature for 30 min. The nitrocellulose was washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween for 15 min each before exposing the blot to another antibody. Yeast cells harvested from a 25-ml aliquot during the time course induction of PAP and PAPx in wild-type and mak8–1 cells were ground to a fine powder in liquid N2 with a mortar and pestle. Cold (4 °C) buffer A (4 ml of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 200 mm KCl, 200 mm sucrose, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm EGTA, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to the yeast powder and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was increased to 13 ml with buffer A and layered over a 10-ml cushion of 1 m sucrose, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. Ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 311,000 × g for 3.5 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Total ribosomes (50 μg) isolated from yeast cells expressing PAP, PAPx, or vector control were resuspended in RIP buffer (167 mm KCl, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm MgCl2) to a final volume of 100 μl. Extraction of rRNA and subsequent analysis for depurination were conducted according to Tumer et al. (23Tumer N.E. Hwang D-J. Bonness M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3866-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A positive control standard for depurination was generated by incubating 50 μg of ribosomes from wild-type yeast with 100 ng of purified PAP (Calbiochem) in RIP buffer. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and RNA was isolated as referenced above. Depurination of rRNA was confirmed by the presence of a 360-nucleotide fragment visible on the urea-acrylamide gel. PAP and L3 expressed in vivo in wild-type and mak8–1 cells were co-immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody to L3 essentially as described by Otto and Lee (24Otto J.J. Lee S.-W. Methods Cell Biol. 1993; 37: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ribosomes (100 μg) from cells induced to express PAP, PAPx, or vector control were used as substrate for immunoprecipitation with protein A-Sepharose beads. The pelleted complex of antibody and protein was eluted from the beads with SDS sample buffer and visualized by immunoblot analysis using the antibodies to PAP and L3. Co-immunoprecipitation of in vitrosynthesized L3 with purified PAP was used to demonstrate a direct interaction between these two proteins. Radiolabeled L3 (3 nm), synthesized by a linked transcription translation system (TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) was incubated with 3 nm purified nonradiolabeled PAP and immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal L3 antibody. Proteins were eluted from the Sepharose beads with SDS sample buffer, and the solution was divided in half. Half was separated through 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the polyclonal antibody to PAP. The remaining half was also separated through 12% SDS-PAGE, then incubated with Entensify Solution A and B (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and exposed to autoradiography. PAP removes a specific adenine residue from the α-sarcin loop of yeast 25 S rRNA. Because this loop is located near the peptidyltransferase center, we introduced PAP into the strain harboring the mak8–1 allele to determine whether this mutation conferred resistance to the cytostatic effects of PAP. Both wild-type and mak8–1 cells were transformed with the LEU2-based vector, pNT188, containing the PAP cDNA under the control of a GAL1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 1, galactose induction of PAP expression did not have a cytostatic effect on the growth of the strain harboring the mak8–1 allele. In contrast, growth of wild-type cells was significantly inhibited when PAP expression was induced by galactose. To confirm this observation, isogenicRPL3::hisG strains (18Peltz S.W. Hammell A.B. Cui Y. Yasenchak J. Puljanowski L. Dinman J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were tested for their sensitivity to PAP. Cells harboring pmak8–1 were able to grow under PAP induction, whereas cells containing pRPL3 encoding wild-type L3 did not grow (data not shown). Resistance to PAP may have arisen because either transcript or protein had not accumulated inmak8–1 cells. To determine whether PAP transcripts were synthesized, nuclease protection assays were performed to examine the accumulation of PAP mRNA relative to CYH2 mRNA, an internal control that encodes the ribosomal protein L29 (25Stocklein W. Piepersberg W. Curr. Genet. 1980; 1: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The levels of PAP transcript were compared with those of PAPx, the active-site mutant of PAP. The zero hour time point represents cells grown in raffinose under noninducing conditions. As shown in Fig.2, cells grown in raffinose did not express PAP or PAPx transcripts. However, 2 h after shifting to galactose-containing medium, transcripts corresponding to both PAP and PAPx were detected in mak8–1 cells. Quantitation of PAP mRNA, relative to the CYH2 internal control, indicated that both PAP and PAPx transcript levels remained constant during the time course of induction. A protected RNA fragment corresponding to PAP was not observed in cells containing the vector alone, 8 h after induction by galactose (Fig. 2, lane VC). When tRNA was used in place of total cellular RNA as a control, no specific binding by the radiolabeled probes was detected (Fig. 2, lane tRNA). These results demonstrated that both PAP and PAPx mRNAs were transcribed in cells harboring the mak8–1 allele, and no significant difference in the level of transcripts could be detected in cells expressing PAP or PAPx. To test whether PAP was expressed and accumulated in mak8–1cells, immunoblot analysis was conducted on aliquots harvested from cells grown on galactose medium through a 24-h time course. The same experiment was carried out with wild-type yeast cells harboring PAP (NT188) and PAPx (NT224). Similar amounts of PAP and PAPx were expressed in mak8–1 cells, suggesting a lack of toxicity due to PAP accumulation, whereas in wild-type cells, PAPx was expressed to a greater degree than PAP (Fig. 3). The higher molecular mass protein reacting with the PAP antibody likely represents the precursor form of PAP, observed previously in yeast (9Hur Y. Hwang D.-J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PAPx often results in lower molecular mass proteins, most likely breakdown products, seen clearly in wild-type cells induced for 24 h. However, the primary band in each immunoblot is the 29-kDa mature form of PAP. To determine whether there were differences between the ability of PAP to depurinate ribosomes from wild-type and mak8–1 cells in vivo, ribosomes were isolated from yeast cells induced to express PAP or PAPx for 8 h. rRNA was isolated from these ribosomes, treated with aniline, and separated on a urea-acrylamide gel. Depurination of rRNA was revealed by the presence of the 360-nucleotide fragment produced by removal of a purine residue from the 25 S rRNA and subsequent cleavage at that site by treatment with aniline (arrow in Fig. 4). A positive standard for depurination was generated by incubating wild-type ribosomes with PAP in vitro, extracting the rRNA, and treating it with aniline (Fig. 4, lane std). Ribosomes isolated from wild-type cells harvested 8 h after induction of PAP expression were depurinated, whereas ribosomes of cells harboring themak8–1 allele were not depurinated during PAP expressionin vivo (Fig. 4.). Ribosomes isolated from both cell types expressing PAPx were not depurinated, which was consistent with the prior observation that PAPx lacks enzymatic activity. A possible reason for the lack of depurination of rRNA inmak8–1 cells was that PAP may not be able to access its rRNA substrate in these cells. To determine whether PAP associated with ribosomes in wild-type cells, ribosomes examined for depurination were also assessed by immunoblot analysis with the affinity-purified antibody against PAP. As illustrated in Fig.5 A, both PAP and PAPx were associated with ribosomes in wild-type cells. In contrast, neither PAP nor PAPx could be detected with ribosomes isolated frommak8–1 cells. The higher levels of PAPx associated with ribosomes of wild-type cells likely reflected the increased level of expression of enzymatically inactive PAPx relative to the enzymatically active PAP (Fig. 3). The immunoblots of ribosomal proteins were stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal antibody against L3 to illustrate that L3 or its mutant form was detected on both types of ribosomes and that similar amounts of protein were loaded from both cell types (Fig. 5 B). Results described above indicated that PAP is associated with ribosomes in wild-type cells but not in mak8–1 cells, suggesting that PAP may interact with L3. To test the hypothesis of direct interaction with L3, purified PAP was mixed with in vitro synthesized L3 or Mak8–1p and co-immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal L3 antibody. Purified PAP co-immunoprecipitated with L3 or Mak8–1p when it was mixed with either protein and not when it was incubated alone (Fig.6 A). As expected, L3 and Mak8–1p were immunoprecipitated with L3 antibody when they were each mixed with PAP or incubated alone (Fig. 6 B). These results indicated that PAP binds directly to L3 or Mak8–1p in its free form (Fig. 6 A). To determine whether PAP interacts with L3 and Mak8–1p incorporated into ribosomes, ribosomes from wild-type or mak8–1 cells expressing either PAP, PAPx, or vector alone were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal L3 antibody. As shown in Fig.7 A, PAPx was co-immunoprecipitated with L3 from ribosomes of wild-type, but notmak8–1 cells, indicating that PAPx does not interact with the mutant form of L3 in ribosomes. The lack of co-immunoprecipitation of PAP with L3 from ribosomes of wild-type cells may reflect the previous observation that wild-type protein is not synthesized as abundantly as the active-site mutant (Fig. 3). The difference may also be the result of variation in the kinetics of association between PAP and PAPx, namely PAP may dissociate more readily from its substrate, the ribosomes, than PAPx. Fig. 7 B illustrates that L3 or Mak8–1p was immunoprecipitated from ribosomes of both cell types and that similar amounts of protein were loaded on the gel. These results suggest that the absence of association between PAP and Mak8–1p in ribosomes may be the result of a conformational change such that the peptide sequence or tertiary structure required is not accessible when Mak8–1p is incorporated into ribosomes. The lack of co-immunoprecipitation of PAP with Mak8–1p in ribosomes substantiates earlier results that showed the absence of PAP in ribosomes frommak8–1 cells and lack of rRNA depurination. We have reported previously that in vivoinduction of PAP expression in yeast had a cytostatic effect (9Hur Y. Hwang D.-J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This work demonstrates that cells containing the mak8–1 allele are resistant to PAP. The lack of growth inhibition observed inmak8–1 cells is because of the fact that ribosomes from these cells are not associated with PAP, and consequently, are not depurinated. The observation that PAP expressed in wild-type yeast depurinates ribosomes but does not when expressed in mak8–1 cells indicates that wild-type L3 is required for depurination of ribosomes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with isolated proteins illustrated that PAP directly binds to L3 and Mak8–1p in vitro. However, when the experiments were repeated using intact ribosomes, PAP co-immunoprecipitated only with wild-type L3 from ribosomes and not with Mak8–1p, indicating that PAP does not interact with Mak8–1p in ribosomes. The quaternary structure of a ribosome containing Mak8–1p may differ from a wild-type ribosome such that the binding site for PAP may be masked in the mutant ribosomes. Alternatively, a difference in post-translational modifications between L3 and Mak8–1p may affect its interaction with PAP in vivo. The hypothesis for altered binding by the mutant L3 is supported by the observation that we did not detect PAP or PAPx associated with ribosomes in mak8–1cells; however, both proteins were associated with ribosomes in wild-type cells. The evidence presented here demonstrates a link between L3 and the α-sarcin loop in eukaryotic ribosomes. Experiments designed to reconstitute the minimal ribosomal particle still capable of enzyme activity have established that L3 is essential for maintaining peptidyltransferase activity (15Hampl H. Schulze H. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2284-2288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A photolabile cDNA probe targeted to the central loop of domain V was shown to cross-link to L3 (26Alexander R.W. Muralikrishna P. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12109-12118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). With the use of a photolabile oligodeoxynucleotide probe complimentary to the α-sarcin region of E. coli, Muralikrishna et al. (11Muralikrishna P. Alexander R.W. Cooperman B.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4562-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently demonstrated the proximity of the α-sarcin region to domains IV and V of E. coli rRNA. tRNA localization experiments further demonstrated the mutual proximity of domains IV, V, and VI within the 50 S subunit (27Joseph S. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Chemical and enzymatic footprinting have shown that L3 binds in region VIA of 23 S rRNA near the α-sarcin loop (28Muralikrishna P. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5421-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Preliminary results from our laboratory indicate that both PAP and PAPx bind to the α-sarcin loop. 2P. Wang and N. E. Tumer, unpublished data. The data presented here substantiate these observations by suggesting that L3 is in close proximity of the α-sarcin loop in yeast 25 S rRNA. These data lead us to propose a model to explain the interaction between PAP and L3. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that PAP binding to ribosomes requires wild-type L3. Therefore, we suggest that PAP accesses its substrate, the α-sarcin loop, by recognizing and binding to L3. Once bound, the close proximity of L3 to the α-sarcin loop would facilitate the subsequent depurination of the 25 S rRNA by PAP. Because PAPx does not interact with ribosomes frommak8–1 cells, we contend that the PAP binding site may be masked in mak8–1 ribosomes. The mak8–1 gene product encodes a mutant L3 that differs from the wild-type by only two amino acid substitutions, W255C and P257S, which may be sufficient to alter the shape of the protein product (18Peltz S.W. Hammell A.B. Cui Y. Yasenchak J. Puljanowski L. Dinman J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), affecting its interaction with other components of the ribosome. If rRNA is necessary to place the ribosomal proteins in a proper conformation to facilitate PAP binding, the point mutations in Mak8–1p may alter the interaction between rRNA and Mak8–1p. Although the mechanism underlying the catalytic activity of RIPs is understood, very little is known about how RIPs gain access to the ribosome. Although all RIPs have the same specificity for adenine 4324 of naked 28 S rRNA, they show very different levels of activity against ribosomes of different species. For example, ricin is 23,000 times more active on rat liver ribosomes than on plant ribosomes (29Harley S.M. Beevers H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5935-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas PAP is equally active on ribosomes from all five kingdoms. These data suggest that the differences in sensitivity of ribosomes to RIPs may reflect differences in interactions of RIPs with ribosomal proteins. Endo and Tsurugi (30Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the ricin A chain depurinated rat rRNA at adenine 4324 in intact ribosomes much more efficiently than naked 28 S rRNA. Conversely, the ricin A chain depurinated naked 23 S rRNA of E. coli at the homologous adenine 2660 and did not depurinate intact E. coli ribosomes. Formation of a covalent complex between saporin and a component of the 60 S subunit of yeast ribosomes was shown by chemical cross-linking (31Ippoliti R. Lendaro E. Bellelli A. Brunori M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ricin A chain has been cross-linked to mammalian ribosomal proteins L9 and L10e (32Vater C.A. Bartle L.M. Leszyk J.D. Lambert J.M. Goldmacher V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12933-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite some evidence for the dependence of RIP activity on the type of ribosomal substrate, the functional significance of the association between RIPs and ribosomal proteins has not been reported. Nevertheless, these observations support the hypothesis for a molecular recognition mechanism involving one or more ribosomal proteins that could provide receptor sites for toxins and favor optimal binding to the target adenine. The results reported here demonstrate that PAP gains access to the ribosome by recognizing L3. Because L3 is highly conserved among ribosomes from different species, the interaction between PAP and L3 may be the underlying reason for the broad spectrum activity of PAP on ribosomes from different organisms.

Fluorimetric analyses demonstrated that QacA confers resistance to the divalent cation 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, utilizing a proton motive force-dependent efflux mechanism previously demonstrated for QacA-mediated resistance to the monovalent cation ethidium. Both the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin inhibited QacA-mediated export of ethidium, indicating an electrogenic drug/nH+ (n ≥ 2) antiport mechanism.

Competition studies showed that QacA-mediated ethidium export is competitively inhibited by monovalent cations, e.g. benzalkonium, and non-competitively inhibited by divalent cations, e.g.propamidine, which suggests that monovalent and divalent cations bind at distinct sites on the QacA protein. The quaternary ammonium salt, 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, was used as a membrane-specific fluorescence probe and demonstrated that the amount of substrate entering the inner leaflet was significantly reduced in QacA-containing strains, supporting the notion that the substrate is extruded directly from the membrane.

The multidrug resistance gene qacA is encoded on multiresistance plasmids from clinical isolates of S. aureusand confers resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial organic cations, including various dyes, Qacs, diamidines, biguanidines, and guanylhydrazones (8Littlejohn T.G.

QacA and a closely related protein, QacB, also found in clinical isolates of S. aureus, mediate high levels of resistance to monovalent cations, including a number of intercalating dyes and Qacs. However, QacB characteristically differs from QacA in that it confers significantly reduced levels of resistance to divalent cationic drugs, such as diamidines and biguanidines (8Littlejohn T.G.

Sequence analysis and mutagenesis studies have revealed that the difference in substrate specificity between QacA and QacB is due to a single amino acid substitution at position 323 in TMS 10, where the presence of an acidic residue in QacA is essential for high levels of resistance to diamidines and biguanidines (18Paulsen I.T.

The wider substrate specificity of QacA compared with QacB may have evolved in response to the clinical use of divalent cations as chemotherapeutic agents (20Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3477-3479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, fluorescence transport assays have been utilized to measure various aspects of the bioenergetics ofqacA-mediated multidrug transport. Kinetic analyses of transport of monovalent and divalent fluorescent substrates show for the first time that QacA interacts with each of its substrates with high affinity. Interactions between various substrates and QacA using competition analysis suggest that there are distinct binding sites for monovalent and divalent cations. Transport assays utilizing a membrane-specific fluorescence probe provide evidence that QacA extrudes its substrates from the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. The S. aureusstrain SK982 was used as the host strain for theqacA-encoding plasmid pSK1 and the qacB-encoding plasmid pSK23, as described previously (8Littlejohn T.G. Paulsen I.T. Gillespie M.T. Tennent J.M. Midgley M. Jones I.G. Purewal A.S. Skurray R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 259-266Crossref Google Scholar). The E. coli K-12 strain BHB2600 (F'803 supE supF hsdR met) (21Hohn B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 68: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) was used as the host strain for the plasmid constructs pSK4219 and pSK4270, which contain the qacA and qacB genes cloned into pBluescript SK+, respectively (18Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Littlejohn T.G. Mitchell B.A. Skurray R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3630-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). All strains were cultured at 37 °C in LB containing, where appropriate, 25 μg/ml gentamicin or 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Diamidinodiphenylamine and propamidine were provided by Rhône-Poulenc Rorer (Dagenham, United Kingdom). Benzalkonium, CCCP, chlorhexidine, DAPI, DiOC3, ethidium, nigericin, pyronin Y, reserpine, tetraphenylarsonium, TMA-DPH, valinomycin, and verapamil were all purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Nigericin and valinomycin were dissolved in 100% chloroform. Reserpine was prepared as a 1 mg/ml stock solution in 9:1 chloroform:methanol. Verapamil and TMA-DPH were solubilized in 50% and 100% methanol, respectively. CCCP was prepared as a solution in 1 mg/ml ethanol and then diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in 10 mm NaOH as described previously (22Lambert B. LePecq J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were prepared as stock solutions of 1 or 10 mg/ml in water, depending on solubility, immediately prior to use. MICs of DAPI, DiOC3, reserpine, TMA-DPH, and verapamil were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. 100 μl of LB was added to each well together with increasing concentrations of the antimicrobial agent within the range of susceptibility and 1 × 10−4 dilution of an overnight culture of the strain to be tested. Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, and the MICs were determined by scoring the lowest concentration at which no growth was observed. For each compound, the MIC analysis was carried out in triplicate. Fluorimetric assays of QacA- and QacB-mediated efflux of DAPI, DiOC3, ethidium, and pyronin Y were carried out essentially as described previously for ethidium (8Littlejohn T.G. Paulsen I.T. Gillespie M.T. Tennent J.M. Midgley M. Jones I.G. Purewal A.S. Skurray R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 259-266Crossref Google Scholar). These substrates bind to specific cellular components and in so doing undergo a change in fluorescence that can be used to indicate how much of the substrate is retained by the cell,e.g. ethidium and DAPI bind to double-stranded DNA resulting in a substantial increase in fluorescence (22Lambert B. LePecq J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Kapuscinski J. Szer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), DiOC3, when bound to the cytoplasmic side of hyperpolarized membranes, is highly fluorescent (24$$Google Scholar), and pyronin Y binds to RNA resulting in fluorescence quenching (25Crissman H.A. Darzynkiewicz Z. Tobey R.A. Steinkamp J.A. Science. 1985; 228: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The S. aureus strain SK982, carrying the qacA-encoding plasmid pSK1 or theqacB-encoding plasmid pSK23, was grown for 16 h in 10 ml of LB (with selection) from which 1 ml was subcultured into 10 ml of fresh LB and grown to OD650 = 0.85 (∼2.5 h). The E. coli strain BHB2600, carrying pSK4219 (qacA), pSK4270 (qacB) or the vector (pBluescript SK+), was grown for 16 h in 10 ml of LB (with selection) from which 1 ml was subcultured into 10 ml of fresh LB and grown to OD650 = 0.6 (∼3.5 h). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice and resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). Aliquots (1 ml) of cells were then loaded with each individual substrate (10 μm DAPI, 2.5 μm DiOC3, 15 μm ethidium, or 15 μm pyronin Y) by incubating for 1.5 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm CCCP. Loaded cells were collected by centrifugation, washed three times and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). Energy-dependent efflux was assayed following the addition of sodium formate to a final concentration of 125 mm. 10 μm CCCP was used as an inhibitor in some experiments. Fluorimetric measurements were performed at 37 °C using a Hitachi 4500 fluorimeter (slit widths of 5 nm). The excitation and emission wavelengths used for each of the fluorescent compounds are as follows: DAPI, 364 nm and 454 nm, respectively; DiOC3, 485 nm and 520 nm, respectively; ethidium, 530 nm and 610 nm, respectively; and pyronin Y, 500 nm and 570 nm, respectively. Increasing substrate concentrations were used to establish the kinetics of QacA- and QacB-mediated drug efflux inE. coli and in S. aureus. Aliquots (1 ml) of cells were prepared as described above and loaded with the appropriate range of concentrations for each substrate: DAPI, 1–25 μm; DiOC3, 0.1–10 μm; ethidium, 0.1–25 μm; and pyronin Y, 1–50 μm. From these concentrations, a series of efflux curves were generated and the initial velocity was calculated by averaging the linear part of each curve. The range of substrate concentrations was selected to be equally spread above and below theK m, and a minimum of 10 substrate concentrations were utilized for each experiment. The non-linear least squares method (v = V max·[S]/([S] +K m)); where [S] represents substrate concentration, was the method of choice to obtain estimates ofK m and V max. Software for the non-linear least squares method was kindly provided by Dr Ray Ritchie (School of Biological Sciences, University of Sydney) and uses a general least squares fitting technique to determine accurate estimates of K m and V max, followed by matrix algebra to refine and calculate the errors of these estimations (26Ritchie R.J. Prvan T. Biochem. Edu. 1996; 24: 196-206Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). K m and V maxcalculations were confirmed by double-reciprocal plots where 1/velocity (v) is plotted as a function of 1/[S]. Aliquots (1 ml) ofS. aureus cells were prepared as described above, loaded with 15 μm ethidium, washed three times, and resuspended in the appropriate buffer. To measure inhibition by the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin, cells were resuspended in a potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm KH2PO4 and 1.0 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0). Nigericin or valinomycin, at a final concentration of 4 μm, was added to loaded cells and incubated for 1 min followed by the addition of sodium formate, to a final concentration of 125 mm, to energize transport. To measure inhibition by reserpine and verapamil, cells were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and 50 μm reserpine or 150 μm verapamil. Loaded cells were washed three times and resuspended in 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.0), and fluorimetric measurements were obtained after the addition of sodium formate to energize transport. Competition analyses were performed by determining the kinetics of QacA- and QacB-mediated export of ethidium (0.5–25 μm) in the presence of various fixed concentrations of non-fluorescent substrates, including the monovalent cations benzalkonium (2–10 μm) and tetraphenylarsonium (5–100 μm), and the divalent cations chlorhexidine (2–10 μm), propamidine (5–100 μm), and diamidinodiphenylamine (5–150 μm). Aliquots of S. aureus cells were loaded with both substrates in the presence of 10 μm CCCP for 1.5 h and harvested by centrifugation. Export of ethidium was measured fluorimetrically as described above. The results were illustrated graphically by double-reciprocal plots using the computer program Cricket Graph (Computer Associates International) to obtain a line of best fit. TMA-DPH specifically fluoresces in lipid environments (27Prendergast F.G. Haughland R.P. Callahan P.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7333-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) with an excitation and emission spectra of 350 nm and 425 nm, respectively (24$$Google Scholar). S. aureusstrains, harboring plasmids pSK1, pSK23, or no plasmid, were prepared as described above for fluorimetric analysis. 2.5 μmTMA-DPH was added to cell suspensions, and accumulation of this substrate was measured fluorimetrically. Cells were also preloaded with 2.5 μm TMA-DPH in the presence of 10 μmCCCP as for other fluorescent substrates and efflux generated by the addition of sodium formate to a final concentration of 125 mm. 10 μm CCCP was used as an inhibitor in some experiments. The multidrug export protein QacA confers resistance to more than 30 compounds that belong to 12 distinct chemical families (TableI; Refs. 8Littlejohn T.G. Paulsen I.T. Gillespie M.T. Tennent J.M. Midgley M. Jones I.G. Purewal A.S. Skurray R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 259-266Crossref Google Scholar, 9Tennent J.M. Lyon B.R. Midgley M. Jones I.G. Purewal A.S. Skurray R.A. J. Gen.

To establish if QacA and the closely related staphylococcal protein QacB mediate the efflux of structurally dissimilar compounds via a common mechanism, fluorimetric transport analyses of the monovalent substrates ethidium and pyronin Y, and two newly identified substrates, the monovalent cation DiOC3 (S. aureus MICs: SK982, <0.25 μg/ml; pSK1 or pSK23 in SK982, 8 μg/ml) and the divalent cation DAPI (S. aureus MICs: SK982 or pSK23 in SK982, 20 μg/ml; pSK1 in SK982, >80 μg/ml), all from different chemical families (Table I), were performed (Fig. 1). Formate-driven efflux of DAPI, DiOC3, and ethidium are shown as a rapid decrease in fluorescence, whereas efflux of pyronin Y is observed as a rapid increase in fluorescence (see “Experimental Procedures”). QacA-mediated efflux of all four substrates tested was abolished by the addition of CCCP (data not shown), an uncoupler of the PMF, which suggests that QacA mediates the extrusion of structurally dissimilar monovalent and divalent substrates via a common PMF-dependent efflux mechanism (Fig. 1). Similarly, QacB-mediated efflux of the monovalent substrates DiOC3, ethidium and pyronin Y was inhibited by CCCP. QacB demonstrated no efflux of the divalent diamidine DAPI (Fig. 1), in accord with the MIC data and previous observations that QacB confers little or no resistance to the diamidines (8Littlejohn T.G. Paulsen I.T. Gillespie M.T. Tennent J.M. Midgley M. Jones I.G. Purewal A.S. Skurray R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 259-266Crossref Google Scholar, 17Mitchell B.A. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A.

Wang J. Silverman M. Reithmeier R. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Garrigos M. Mir L.M. Orlowski S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 664-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 30Yelin R. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); the transporter has an indiscriminate binding mechanism, which would enable it to recognize many different structures; or the transporter is involved in altering some biophysical parameter of the cell, such as the magnitude of the Δψ or the ΔpH, the result of which drives the movement of various charged compounds across the cell membrane (31Roepe P.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 445-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To determine if QacA and QacB interact specifically with structurally dissimilar substrates, kinetic analyses of transport were performed using various fluorescent substrates. These kinetic analyses, undertaken in whole cells, were based on the assumptions that after loading the cells in the presence of CCCP, the intracellular substrate concentration is effectively equivalent to the extracellular concentration, and that the use of fluorescence can accurately represent the amount of substrate inside the cell as has previously been demonstrated for ethidium, namely the amounts of ethidium retained by E. coli, calculated utilizing either fluorimetry or [14C]ethidium produced identical results (22Lambert B. LePecq J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Consistent with these assumptions was the observation that the amount of the fluorescent substrate in loaded cells was proportional to the concentration used. Similar kinetic studies of multidrug efflux systems using whole cells have been performed in P. aeruginosa (32Ocaktan A. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21964-21969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (33Liu J. Takiff H.E. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3791-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Examination of the relationship between increasing substrate concentration and the transport velocity indicated that QacA- and QacB-mediated export of monovalent and divalent cations conformed to classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig.2), with the exception that export of DAPI by QacB was not observed at any concentration (Fig. 2 Band Table II). The kinetic parameters,K m and V max, for transport of the fluorescent substrates DAPI, DiOC3, ethidium, and pyronin Y were determined (Table II). Similar K mvalues were obtained from fluorimetric analyses performed in the natural host S. aureus, and in the heterologous hostE. coli, suggesting that these proteins function similarly in both organisms. Both QacA and QacB demonstrated a high affinity for their substrates with K m values in the low micromolar range (<20 μm; Table II). QacA-mediated export of monovalent cations, e.g. DiOC3, ethidium, and pyronin Y, displayed an increasedV max, but not K m, compared with QacB-mediated efflux of these compounds (Table II), suggesting that although QacA and QacB bind monovalent substrates with equally high affinity, QacA may transport them at a faster rate.Table IIComparative kinetic dataTransporteraThe E. coli strain BHB2600, harboring plasmid pSK4219 (QacA) or plasmid pSK4270 (QacB), and the S. aureus strain SK982, harboring plasmid pSK1 (QacA), or plasmid pSK23 (QacB) were used throughout this study.

Open table in a new tab Estimates of K m and V max were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and errors are shown in parentheses. Fractional inhibitory concentration analysis has indicated that QacA confers resistance to two compounds at a rate proportional to the overall amount of substrate present, thereby implying that the presence of one compound inhibits the transport of another (17Mitchell B.A. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fluorimetric competition studies were performed in S. aureus to examine QacA-mediated transport of ethidium in the presence of various non-fluorescent substrates (Fig.3). The monovalent cations benzalkonium and tetraphenylarsonium competitively inhibited QacA-mediated export of ethidium (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas the divalent cations chlorhexidine and propamidine non-competitively inhibited QacA-mediated export of ethidium (Fig. 3, C andD). The ability of the monovalent cations benzalkonium and tetraphenylarsonium to competitively inhibit ethidium transport suggests that these substrates either share a common binding site or have unique but overlapping binding sites. In contrast, the divalent cations propamidine and chlorhexidine appear to bind at a distinct site(s) in QacA compared with ethidium. QacB-mediated export of ethidium was competitively inhibited by the monovalent cations benzalkonium and tetraphenylarsonium within a similar concentration range as shown for QacA (data not shown). These data, together with the fact that QacA and QacB differ by only 7 amino acids (18Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Littlejohn T.G. Mitchell B.A. Skurray R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3630-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and display similar binding constants for monovalent cations (Table II), imply that these two transporters possess identical binding site(s) for monovalent substrates. The divalent cation propamidine non-competitively inhibited QacB-mediated ethidium efflux only at a substantially higher concentration (≥40 μm) compared with QacA (10 μm; see Fig. 3 D), and the divalent cation diamidinodiphenylamine did not inhibit QacB-mediated ethidium efflux even at a concentration of 150 μm. This is consistent with the resistance profile of QacB, which provides a low degree of resistance to propamidine and no resistance to diamidinodiphenylamine (8Littlejohn T.G. Paulsen I.T. Gillespie M.T. Tennent J.M. Midgley M. Jones I.G. Purewal A.S. Skurray R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 259-266Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, despite the high level of similarity between QacA and QacB, they display completely different binding characteristics for divalent cations. To investigate which component, i.e. the ΔpH and/or the Δψ of the ΔμH+ is involved in energizing QacA-mediated drug efflux, transport assays were performed in the presence of the ionophores, valinomycin and nigericin. In potassium-buffered solutions, the potassium ionophore valinomycin specifically collapses the Δψ, whereas nigericin, which allows H+:K+ exchange, specifically collapses the ΔpH (34Kaback H.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 279-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Both nigericin and valinomycin inhibited QacA-mediated efflux of ethidium (Fig. 4 A) and DAPI (data not shown), indicating that both the ΔpH and the Δψ are required to energize QacA-mediated efflux of monovalent and divalent cations. This is consistent with an electrogenic proton/antiport mechanism, e.g. an exchange of two or more protons for one molecule of substrate in the case of ethidium. Sensitivity to reserpine and verapamil has been observed in an extensive range of multidrug efflux systems, including: members of the ABC superfamily, e.g. P-glycoprotein (35Wigler P.W. Patterson F.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); the major facilitator superfamily, e.g. the mammalian VMAT protein (30Yelin R. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Bmr from B. subtilis (36Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Neyfakh A.A. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11086-11089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and LmrP fromL. lactis (37Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Brands J.R. Putman M. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24123-24128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); and the small multidrug resistance superfamily, e.g. EmrE from E. coli (38Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). MIC analysis demonstrated that QacA does not confer resistance to either reserpine or verapamil. However, both substances inhibited QacA-mediated ethidium export at a concentration of 50 μm(reserpine) or 150 μm (verapamil) (Fig.4 B). The hydrophobic compound TMA-DPH fluoresces when partitioned into the membrane (27Prendergast F.G. Haughland R.P. Callahan P.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7333-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and has been utilized to identify the sub-cellular origin of efflux for various multidrug export systems (32Ocaktan A. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21964-21969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Brands J.R. Putman M. Poolman B.

Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). TMA-DPH was shown to be a QacA substrate by using drug susceptibility (S. aureus MICs: SK982, 15 μg/ml; pSK1 in SK982, 30 μg/ml), and formate-driven efflux (Fig.5 A) studies. TMA-DPH accumulation and efflux in cells expressing qacA were indistinguishable from cells lacking qacA, following treatment with the uncoupler CCCP (Fig. 5, A andB). It should be noted that CCCP partially quenches TMA-DPH fluorescence, resulting in the observed lower fluorescence of the CCCP-treated cells. TMA-DPH has previously been shown to display a biphasic interaction with bacterial membranes, where the first phase is represented by the intercalation of this compound into the outer leaflet of the membrane resulting in a very rapid increase in fluorescence, and the second phase is represented by the movement of this compound from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet of the membrane resulting in a more gradual increase in fluorescence (24$$Google Scholar, 39Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Molenaar D. Poolman B. Driessen A. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Fluorimetric analysis of TMA-DPH accumulation by the staphylococcal strain SK982, with and without the qacA-containing plasmid pSK1, indicated that TMA-DPH intercalates into the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane in both strains, as represented by a rapid increase in fluorescence (Fig. 5 B). The first phase was observed as an almost instantaneous increase in fluorescence, occurring at approximately the 30-s point in Fig. 5 B. However, the second phase, represented by a gradual increase in fluorescence, where the substrate moves from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, was significantly reduced in the QacA-containing strain relative to the background strain (Fig.5 B). This suggests that QacA interacts with, and expels TMA-DPH from, the cell membrane, preventing it from entering the inner leaflet and hence the cytoplasm. The staphylococcal multidrug export protein QacA confers resistance to an extensive range of monovalent and divalent, antimicrobial, lipophilic compounds (Table I). QacA-mediated PMF-dependent efflux of one divalent and three monovalent cations was demonstrated by using fluorescent transport assays (Fig.1). This suggests that QacA utilizes a common PMF-dependent efflux mechanism for transport of all of its substrates. QacA-mediated export of the monovalent cation ethidium and the divalent cation DAPI was inhibited by the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin (Fig.4 A), which specifically dissipate the Δψ and the ΔpH, respectively. This indicates that the PMF-dependent mechanism utilized by QacA requires both components of the ΔμH+ to energize transport and implies for monovalent cations, a stoichiometry of at least two protons being exchanged for one molecule of substrate. Similar energy requirements have been shown for some other multidrug efflux systems,e.g. the mammalian VMAT proteins, which mediate monoamine antiport in exchange for two protons (40Njus D. Kelley P.M. Harnadek G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 853: 237-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and LmrP-mediated drug efflux from L. lactis, which is reliant on both the Δψ and the ΔpH of the ΔμH+, suggesting an electrogenic drug/nH+ (n ≥ 2) antiport mechanism (37Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W.

Fluorimetric analysis of the kinetic parameters of QacA-mediated export of DAPI, DiOC3, ethidium, and pyronin Y producedK m values in the low micromolar range,i.e. <20 μm (Table II), indicating that QacA interacts with each structurally dissimilar substrate with high affinity. Similarly, other multidrug efflux systems have been demonstrated to possess a high affinity for their substrates,e.g. Smr-mediated efflux of triphenylmethylphosphonium (K m of 5 μm) (12Grinius L.L. Goldberg E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29998-30004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and MexA/B-OprM-mediated efflux of dimethylaminostyryl-1-ethylpyridinium inP. aeruginosa (K m of 10 μm) (32Ocaktan A. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21964-21969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). QacA and the closely related QacB share similar binding affinities for monovalent cations (Table II), and ethidium efflux mediated by these two proteins was competitively inhibited by other monovalent cations (Fig. 3, A and B). Taken collectively, these data are indicative that the QacA and QacB multidrug efflux proteins potentially utilize a common mechanism for the recognition of monovalent ligands. However, QacA and QacB differ in their recognition of divalent cations, reflected by the inability of QacB to transport DAPI (Fig. 2; Table II). QacA-mediated ethidium efflux was non-competitively inhibited by divalent cations (Fig.3 C and D), whereas QacB-mediated ethidium efflux was unaffected by diamidinodiphenylamine and non-competitively inhibited by propamidine, although only at high concentrations. These data are consistent with the relative resistance profiles conferred by QacA and QacB (8Littlejohn T.G. Paulsen I.T. Gillespie M.T. Tennent J.M. Midgley M. Jones I.G. Purewal A.S. Skurray R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 259-266Crossref Google Scholar, 17Mitchell B.A. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, QacA appears to utilize a high affinity binding site(s) for the recognition of divalent cations, distinct from the site(s) responsible for recognition of monovalent cations; QacB lacks this high affinity binding mechanism, but is capable of binding some divalent cations, albeit with a lower affinity. Previous studies have shown that a single amino acid, namely Asp-323 located in TMS 10 of QacA, is essential for conferring high levels of resistance to diamidines and the biguanidine, chlorhexidine, implying that this region may form part of the high affinity binding site(s) for divalent cations in QacA (18Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Littlejohn T.G. Mitchell B.A. Skurray R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3630-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Although QacB can interact with some divalent cations with a low affinity, mutation of Asp-323 in QacA to Ala, the residue at this position in QacB, abolished all resistance to these compounds (18Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Littlejohn T.G. Mitchell B.A. Skurray R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3630-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). There are six additional amino acid differences between QacA and QacB, some of which are likely to be involved in forming the binding site responsible for low level resistance to the diamidines mediated by QacB. Previous studies have supported the notion that QacA evolved from QacB (20Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3477-3479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here imply that this evolutionary process entailed the acquisition of a high affinity binding mechanism for divalent cations and the concomitant loss of a low affinity binding mechanism for selected divalent cations. TMA-DPH is a fluorescence probe that specifically interacts with the cytoplasmic membrane. TMA-DPH was shown to be a substrate of QacA (Fig.5 A), and it was demonstrated that QacA reduces the accumulation of TMA-DPH in the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that QacA is most likely to interact with this substrate within the membrane. Whether the findings with TMA-DPH can be extrapolated to include all QacA substrates is unknown, but this is an appealing hypothesis, since the known substrates of QacA are all hydrophobic, lipophilic cations (Table I). The multidrug transport systems LmrP (37Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Brands J.R. Putman M. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have been shown to extrude substrates directly from the cytoplasmic membrane, implying this may be a general feature of multidrug efflux systems. The results presented here provide evidence that the multidrug transport protein QacA interacts directly and specifically with its substrates and that this interaction may occur, in the first instance, in the cell membrane as the substrate is entering the cell. Such a mechanism would prevent toxic antimicrobial agents from reaching intracellular targets. Intramembranous transporter-substrate interactions imply that critical sites in the protein are accessible directly from within the lipid phase. Residues contained within TMS, such as Asp-323 in TMS 10 of QacA, are ideal candidates for such interactions.

B., Jr., and Marchase, R. B. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 5192–5196). To determine the structural features of CFTR required for endocytosis, we prepared chimeric molecules consisting of the amino-terminal (residues 2–78) and carboxyl-terminal tail regions (residues 1391–1476) of CFTR, each fused to the transmembrane and extracellular domains of the transferrin receptor. Functional analysis of the CFTR-(2–78) and CFTR-(1391–1476) indicated that both chimeras were rapidly internalized. Deletion of residues 1440–1476 had no effect on chimera internalization. Mutations of potential internalization signals in both cytoplasmic domains reveal that only one mutation inhibits internalization, Y1424A. Using a surface biotinylation reaction, we also examined internalization rates of wild type and mutant CFTRs expressed in COS-7 cells. We found that both wild type and A1440X CFTR were rapidly internalized, whereas the Y1424A CFTR mutant, like the chimeric protein, had ∼40% reduced internalization activity. Deletions in the amino-terminal tail region of CFTR resulted in defective trafficking of CFTR out of the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface, suggesting that an intact amino terminus is critical for biosynthesis. In summary, our results suggest that both tail regions of CFTR are sufficient to promote rapid internalization of a reporter molecule and that tyrosine 1424 is required for efficient CFTR endocytosis.

Our initial studies on the identification of CFTR internalization signals focused on the two tail regions of the CFTR molecule. Here we show that both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail regions of CFTR, residues 2–78 and 1391–1476, are individually sufficient to promote rapid internalization of a reporter molecule, the transferrin receptor (TR). We also demonstrate both in the context of chimeric and native proteins that tyrosine 1424 is important for CFTR endocytosis. Furthermore, we show that the intracellular distribution of the CFTR-TR chimeras is similar to that of the TR, suggesting that endocytosis may regulate CFTR activity at the cell surface. The CFTR-TR chimeras were constructed using the polymerase chain reaction as described previously (20Collawn J.F. Lai A. Domingo D. Fitch M. Hatton S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21686-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A polymerase chain reaction was performed on pKCTR-CFTR cDNA (also referred to as pGT-CFTR), and unique NheI andAflII sites were introduced in the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. For the amino-terminal CFTR tail, the 5′ and 3′ primers were 5′-AA-GCT-AGC-CAG-AGG-TCG-CCT-CTG-GAA-AA-3′ and 5′-AA-CTT-AAG-GAA-AAAACA-TCG-CCG-AAG-GGC, respectively. For the carboxyl-terminal CFTR tail, the 5′ and 3′ primers were 5′-GCT-AGC-GCA-TTT-GCT-GAT-TGC-ACA-GTA-ATT-3′ and 5′-CTT-AAG-TTG-CAC-CTC-TTC-TTCTGT-CTC-CTC-3′, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment was then subcloned into pBluescript SK+ with a human TR insert containing these two sites (ATG-ATG-GCT-AGC-CTT-AAG-AGG) encoding a seven-residue cytoplasmic tail with the sequence Met-Met-Ala-Ser-Leu-Lys-Arg (21Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The addition of the two restriction sites adds three residues, Ala-Ser-Leu, to the tailless TR (Δ3–59; Ref. 22Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of CFTR were inserted between the Ser and Leu residues (Fig. 1). Mutations were introduced into the amino- and carboxyl-terminal tail regions using the Chameleon double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene). The mutations were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For mutagenesis of the amino-terminal region of CFTR, a XmaI–XbaI fragment of pKCTR-CFTR was subcloned into pSK-Bluescript (Stratagene). For mutagenesis of the carboxyl-terminal region of CFTR, aBstXI–SgrAI fragment from pKCTR-CFTR was subcloned into pSK-Bluescript. CFTR point mutations or deletions in the amino- or carboxyl-terminal tail regions were prepared from the corresponding pSK-Bluescript vectors (containing either theXmaI–XbaI or BstXI–SgrAI fragments, respectively) from single-stranded DNA as described previously (11Collawn J.F.

Mutants were selected by restriction mapping or sequencing and then subcloned into theXmaI–XbaI or BstXI–SgrAI site of pKCTR-CFTR. The mutations were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (24Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Biochem. J. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Google Scholar) using the Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Transient expression of wild type or mutant CFTR in COS-7 cells was performed as described by Cheng et al. (30Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2 for 48 h. CFTR function in individual cells was assayed using the halide-quenched dye SPQ (30Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded for 10 min with SPQ (10 mm) by hypotonic shock and then mounted in a specially designed perfusion chamber for fluorescence measurements. Fluorescence (F) of single cells was measured with a Zeiss inverted microscope, a PTI imaging system, and Hamamatsu camera. Excitation was at 340 nm, and emission was >410 nm. All functional studies were at 37 °C. At the beginning of the experiments, cells were bathed in a quenching buffer (NaI buffer; 130 mm NaI, 5 mm KNO3, 2.5 mmCa(NO3)2, 2.5 mmMg(NO3)2, 10 mmd-glucose, 10 mm HEPES), and following establishment of a stable base line, they were switched to a halide-free (NO3) dequenching buffer at 200 s. Cells were stimulated with agonist unless otherwise indicated at 500 s and then returned to the quenching NaI buffer. Fluorescence was normalized to the base-line (quenched) value (average fluorescence from 100 to 200 s), with increases presented as percentage of increaseF over basal level. Each curve was generated from the mean values (±S.E.) of either 1) responding cells (defined by increase in dequench slope of >100% following cAMP stimulation (Fig.8 A wt CFTR, and Fig. 8 B, wt CFTR and 1440X CFTR)), or 2) the total number of screened cells expressing a given construct. Thenumbers in parentheses in the keys are the total cells studied (denominator) and the number of responding cells (numerator). Statistical analysis was by χ2 testing, comparing the number of responding cells in each condition with the wild-type CFTR (Fig. 8 A) or the mock condition (Fig. 8 B). The buffers used in the SPQ assay were 1) NaI buffer, pH 7.3, and 2) NaNO3 buffer (identical to NaI buffer except that 130 mm NaNO3 replaces NaI). Cell surface CFTR biotinylation was performed as described previously (5Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Biotinylated and nonbiotinylated proteins were separated on an immobilized monomeric avidin column (Pierce) as described previously (5Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The unbound fraction and biotin eluent fraction were then quantitated as described below. Wild-type or mutant CFTRs were immunoprecipitated from the pooled fractions (either unbound fraction or biotin eluent fraction) with either anti-C-terminal (24-1) or anti-R domain (13-1) monoclonal antibodies generously supplied by Dr. Seng Cheng (Genzyme). The CFTR immunoprecipitates were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (5Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Quantitation was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The percentage of cell surface CFTR was calculated by dividing the number of counts/min detected in the CFTR C-band of the biotin eluent fraction by the total amount of CFTR C-band found in both the unbound and biotin eluent fractions (5Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells expressing wild-type or mutant CFTRs were trypsinized 12 h after transfection and plated onto glass coverslips. 48 h later, the coverslips were fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) for 30 min at −20 °C, rinsed with 1% BSA in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and incubated with either monoclonal antibody 24–1 or 13–1 (diluted 1:50 in PBS/BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then incubated for 5 min in 1% BSA in PBS (three times), incubated with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 1% BSA, 5% normal goat serum) for 1 h at room temperature, and then rinsed for 5 min in 1% BSA in PBS (3 times). Coverslips were mounted in 1 mg/mlp-phenylenediamine in a 1:10 mixture of PBS/glycerol and sealed with nail polish. Slides were analyzed o a Leitz fluorescence microscope equipped with a Vario Orthomat II camera system and a Texas Red epifluorescence filter module. Micrographs were prepared on T-Max 400 film processed at ASA 800. Chicken embryo fibroblasts expressing the CFTR-TR chimeras and wild-type TR were plated onto glass coverslips and cultured overnight. The coverslips were then rinsed with PBS and fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature; rinsed with PBS; quenched with 0.37% glycine, 0.27% NH4Cl in PBS; and permeabilized with PHS (PBS, 10% horse serum, 0.1% saponin) for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then incubated with JS8 mouse anti-chicken TR antibody (diluted in PHS) and with rabbit anti-human TR (1:500 in PHS) for 30 min at 37 °C and rinsed in PHS at room temperature. The coverslips were next incubated with Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG1 (1:50 dilution in PHS) and with Oregon Green-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:50 in PHS) for 30 min at 37 °C and then rinsed, mounted, and analyzed as described above. To identify the regions of CFTR important for endocytosis, we prepared chimeric molecules consisting of the amino terminus (residues 2–78) and the carboxyl terminus of CFTR (residues 1391–1476), each fused to the transmembrane and extracellular domains of the human TR (Fig. 1). Both chimeras along with a wild-type TR and Δ3–59 TR (a mutant TR that is very poorly internalized (11Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar)) were expressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts using BH-RCAS, a replication-competent retroviral vector derived from the Rous sarcoma virus (26Hughes S.H. Greenhouse J.J. Petropoulos C.J. Sutrave P. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3004-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hughes S.H. Petropoulos C.J. Federspiel M.J. Sutrave P. Forry-Schaudies S. Bradac J.A. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1990; 41 (Suppl.): 39-49Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of both chimeras was confirmed using indirect immunofluorescence and125I-labeled transferrin binding at 4 °C (data not shown). Internalization rates of the CFTR-TR chimeras were monitored using the IN/SUR method of Wiley and Cunningham (28Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of residue 2–78 CFTR-TR and residue 1391–1476 CFTR-TR indicated that both were internalized rapidly (k e = 0.126 and 0.061, respectively, similar in fact to the wild-type TR (k e = 0.090; Fig.2 A). For comparison, the Δ3–59 TR lacking an internalization signal (11Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) was internalized very slowly (k e = 0.009). This suggested that both cytoplasmic tail regions of CFTR were sufficient to promote TR endocytosis. To determine if the potential acidic cluster/casein kinase II region of CFTR (residues 1469–1474) in the carboxyl-terminal tail was important for endocytosis, we prepared a deletion mutant lacking this region, CFTR-(1391–1440) (Fig. 1) and compared the internalization rates of the two chimeras. The results indicate that CFTR-(1391–1440) and CFTR-(1391–1476) chimeras were internalized with similar kinetics (k e = 0.063 versus0.061, respectively; Fig. 2 A), suggesting that the membrane-distal portion of the carboxyl-terminal tail of CFTR was not required for efficient endocytosis. Next, we analyzed CFTR-TR chimeras that contained point mutations in potential internalization signals in both cytoplasmic tail regions: Y38A, L69A, Y1424A, and L1430A (Fig. 1). Analysis of these mutants in internalization assays indicated that only one mutation, Y1424A, affected the internalization rate of the chimeras (Fig. 2 B; ∼40% loss of internalization activity, p < 0.05), suggesting that this residue might be a part of an internalization signal. Since overexpression of the human wild type transferrin receptor (up to 10-fold over the endogenous receptor) does not affect internalization of the endogenous receptor in this cell type (not shown), the endocytic machinery should not be limiting for analysis of the CFTR chimeras. Therefore, we were unable to determine if the CFTR chimeras competed for the same cytosolic factors as the endogenous TR receptors. To examine the intracellular distribution of the chimeras, we compared their distribution to that of the endogenous transferrin receptor using immunofluorescence microscopy. CFTR-(2–78) was localized predominantly to juxtanuclear structures that largely co-localized with the native chicken TR receptor (Fig. 3 B). This is similar to co-localization of the human TR expressed in these cells compared with the endogenous receptor (Fig. 3 A) except that the relative surface expression of the wild-type TR appeared to be much higher (shown in green) than that of CFTR-(2–78) chimera. Very few vesicles were CFTR-(2–78)- (Fig. 3 A) or CFTR-(1391–1440)- (Fig. 3 B) positive only, but there were vesicles containing only TR (shown in red). The intracellular distribution of the CFTR-(1391–1440) chimera (Fig.3 C) appeared similar to that of the CFTR-(2–78) chimera but very different from a “tailless” TR (Δ3–59 TR) that lacks intracellular sorting signals and is localized primarily to the cell surface (Fig. 3 D). Comparison of the CFTR-(1391–1440) with the Y1424A mutant showed little or no difference (not shown). In nonpermeabilized cells, the wild type and tailless TRs are strongly positive by immunofluorescence, whereas the two CFTR chimeras are only weakly positive (not shown). 125I-Labeled transferrin binding at 4 °C indicated that the relative surface expression of both CFTR chimeras is approximately 5–10-fold lower than the wild-type TR (not shown). These results suggest that both chimeras co-localized with the endogenous TR and therefore were a part of the constitutive recycling pathway as is the case for the native TR. Having established that both cytoplasmic tail regions were sufficient for endocytosis, we next determined if they were necessary in the context of the CFTR protein. CFTR, unlike the TR, is a type III membrane protein with 12 membrane-spanning domains. In addition to the R-domain and the two nucleotide binding domains, both amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails of CFTR are cytoplasmic in orientation (Fig.4). Using a cell surface two-step biotinylation assay to monitor CFTR endocytosis (5Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that relies on biotinylation of the carbohydrate side chains found in extracellular loop 4 (Fig. 4), we compared the internalization rate of wild-type CFTR to a previously described premature stop mutant, A1440X(33Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Cheng S.H. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 221-232PubMed Google Scholar). First, we confirmed that A1440X expressed in COS-7 cells is maturely glycosylated by monitoring band C formation (Fig.5 A). Next, using the surface biotinylation assay, we monitored CFTR and A1440X clearance from the cell surface (Fig.6 A). Interestingly, the A1440X premature stop mutant was internalized faster than the wild-type CFTR, suggesting, as had been seen for the chimeric protein, that the last 41 residues in CFTR were not necessary for rapid endocytosis.Figure 5Analysis of CFTR and CFTR mutants expressed in COS-7 cells. CFTR and CFTR mutants expressed in COS-7 cells were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates 48 h posttransfection. The immunoprecipitated CFTR or CFTR mutants were then in vitro phosphorylated with protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (5Prince L.S.

A, internalization of CFTR and A1440X in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type CFTR (pMT-CFTR) or A1440X (pMT-1440X) were analyzed 48 h posttransfection. Cell surface CFTR or CFTR mutants were biotinylated using a two-step cell surface periodate/LC-hydrazide biotinylation procedure previously described (5Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). At zero time, both steps were conducted at 4 °C to label the entire surface pool of CFTR. Internalization is monitored by a loss of biotinylation of the cell surface pool by including a 37 °C incubation period (shown on the x axis as time in min) between periodate and biotin LC-hydrazide treatments. Biotinylated and nonbiotinylated proteins were separated on a monomeric avidin column, and CFTR and A1440Xwere in vitro phosphorylated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography to quantitate the amount of CFTR remaining on the cell surface during the warm-up step. Each time point represents the mean ± S.E. of 13 experiments for wild-type CFTR and 6 for the A1440X. B, internalization of CFTR and Y1424A in COS-7 cells. Cells transfected with wild-type CFTR (pGT-CFTR) or Y1424A were analyzed as described in A for percentage CFTR internalized from the cell surface during the warm-up period. C, percentage of CFTR or Y1424A at the cell surface under steady-state conditions. Cells transfected with CFTR or Y1424A were analyzed for total CFTR expression by performing the two-step biotinylation reaction without a warm-up step. Biotinylated and nonbiotinylated CFTR or Y1424A was separated on a monovalent avidin column and quantitated as described for A. The percentage of CFTR at the cell surface represents the mean ± S.E. of six experiments. D, wild-type CFTR expression in COS-7 cells using pMT-CFTR and pGT-CFTR. COS-7 cells transfected with CFTR using the pMT-CFTR and pGT-CFTR vector were analyzed 48 h posttransfection. Biotinylated (biotin eluent) and nonbiotinylated (unbound) CFTR was separated on a monovalent avidin column. Biotinylated and nonbiotinylated CFTR were then immunoprecipitated from the two fractions, phosphorylated in vitro with protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The positions of bands B and C are indicated on the left. The relative amount of CFTR expressed using the pMT-CFTR vector was always higher than the pGT-CFTR vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we tested the only point mutation that affected internalization of the chimeras, Y1424A. Analysis of this mutation in CFTR revealed that it was maturely glycosylated (Fig. 5 B) but internalized 41% more slowly than the wild-type CFTR protein (k e = 0.16 versus 0.27 (p < 0.01); Fig.6 B). Since slower internalization would imply that the steady-state distribution of Y1424A might favor a higher cell surface distribution pattern, we determined the percentage of CFTR at the cell surface using surface biotinylation at 4 °C. As predicted, the percentage of Y1424A at the cell surface was higher than the wild-type CFTR protein (36.1 versus 23.1% (p < 0.01), respectively; Fig. 6 C), supporting the idea"

The ODC enzyme of protozoan parasites is a novel therapeutic target, becaused,l-α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO; eflornithine), an irreversible inhibitor of ODC (5Metcalf B.W. Bey P. Danzin C.

DFMO is also active against T. b. rhodesiense and T. congolense in murine models and has proven effective against other genera of protozoan parasites in vivo and in vitro, including Plasmodia (7Bitonti A.J.

The ability of trypanosomatids to undergo a very high frequency of homologous recombination allows the disruption of chromosomal loci with transfected drug resistance cassettes (11Cruz A.

A. 1991; 88: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and permits a direct test of gene function. This enables the creation of conditionally lethal parasite strains whose survival and ability to propagate are dependent upon the provision of compounds that can ameliorate the consequences of the genetic lesion. This genetic approach is predicated on the availability of cloned genes and their flanking sequences, and molecular clones encoding ODC have been isolated and characterized from both T. brucei (13Phillips M.A. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and L. donovani (14Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To genetically define the role of ODC in polyamine metabolism and to dissect the polyamine pathway in intact parasites, a null mutant of L. donovani has been created by double-targeted gene replacement in which both wild type ODCalleles have been sequentially eliminated. The phenotypic dissection of the parasites in which the ODC copy number has been genetically altered has established the essential role of ODC in polyamine metabolism, reveals significant discrepancies between the polyamine pathway of the parasite and host cells, has important implications in understanding the therapeutic relevance of the polyamine pathway, and supports a general strategy for the creation of attenuated strains for vaccine development in prophylaxing leishmaniasis. [COOH-14C]Ornithine (50–60 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA), whereas [14C]spermidine trihydrochloride (113 mCi/mmol) and [14C]spermine tetrahydrochloride (115 mCi/mmol) were procured from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Diamines were purchased from Sigma. DFMO was a gift from the Merrell Dow Research Institute (Cincinnati, OH). The pX63-NEO and pX63-HYG plasmids used in the parasite transfections and pSNBR used in the subcloning of a cosmid fragment were generously provided to this laboratory by Dr. Stephen M. Beverley (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Purified L. donovani ODC was furnished by Dr. Margaret A. Phillips (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). All other materials, chemicals, and reagents used in these experiments have been described previously (14Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol.

L. donovani promastigotes, the extracellular insect vector form of the parasite, were grown in DME-L, a completely defined culture medium especially designed for the cultivation of Leishmania (17Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In specified experiments, cells were propagated in a modified DME-L medium, DME-L-CS, in which the bovine serum albumin component of DME-L was replaced with 10% chicken serum. The DI700 cell line is a wild type clone of the Sudanese 1S strain of L. donovani that was used for DNA isolation and library construction and as a recipient strain in all initial transfections. For the purposes of the genetic manipulations reported in this study, DI700 is denoted ODC+/+, in which + refers to the wild type allele. Growth rate determinations in the presence of polyamines and diamines were carried out as described previously (9Kaur K. Emmett K. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Ullman B. J.

Genomic DNA was isolated from L. donovani promastigotes by standard protocols (14Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1665-1671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cosmid library was prepared from DI700 genomic DNA that was partially digested with Sau3A, and 30–45-kb fragments were ligated into the BamHI site of the Supercos 1 cosmid vector using protocols described in the brochure from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). A cosmid encompassing ODC designated ODC-5L1 was isolated and purified using the L. donovani ODC as a probe and stringent hybridization and wash conditions as reported previously (14Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wilson K. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Stringer J.R. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1665-1671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheL. donovani ODC was originally isolated from a bacteriophage clone as described previously by this laboratory (14Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction mapping of the cosmid was performed as described in the relevant brochure from Stratagene. Primers used in the amplification of the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of ODC by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are as follows, with their restriction enzyme sites underlined: 5′F5′, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGTCCACGCTGCACAC-3′; 5′F3′, 5′-GTTGAACTGGCGGGCCGC-3′; 3′F5′, 5′-TCCCCCGGGGGATGCACGGCGACG-3′; and 3′F3′, 5′-GAAGATCTGAGAGGCACTTTACTC-3′. To construct appropriate vectors for the replacement of each wild typeODC allele, a 0.8-kb fragment (5′F) consisting of 410 bp of 5′- untranslated DNA and 390 bp of the ODC open reading frame was ligated into the HindIII-SalI site, and a 2.0-kb fragment of 3′-untranslated DNA (3′F) was inserted into theSmaI-BglII site of both the pX63-NEO (18LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and pX63-HYG (19Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) vectors (Fig. 1). Both 5′F and 3′F were amplified by PCR using standard reaction conditions (15 cycles; 94 °C for 60 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s) for the amplification of DNAs from plasmid or cosmid DNA templates (16Allen T. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5431-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 5′F was generated from a 15-kb HindIII-EcoRI fragment of ODC-5L1 encompassing ODC that had been subcloned into pSNBR (20Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24165-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas 3′F was amplified from the 3.9-kb SalI fragment described by Hanson et al. (14Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sense and antisense primers used in the PCR were 5′F5′ and 5′F3′ for 5′F and 3′F5′ and 3′F3′ for 3′F, respectively. These PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes; 5′F, which has an internalSalI site, was cleaved with HindIII andSalI, whereas 3′F was digested with SmaI andBglII and ligated sequentially into pX63-NEO and pX63-HYG. The presence of the flanking regions and their orientation in the knockout vectors were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) and restriction mapping. The recombinant pX63-NEO and pX63-HYG vectors containing the ODC flanking regions are designated pX63-NEO-Δodc and pX63-HYG-Δodc, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). Parasites were transfected by electroporation using conditions identical to those described previously (18LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). pX63-NEO-Δodc and pX63-HYG-Δodc were linearized with HindIII and BglII and gel purified before electroporation. In the construction of theΔodc strain, the first wild type ODC allele was replaced with pX63-NEO-Δodc to create theODC/odc heterozygote (designated ODC+/n), whereas the second wild type allele was deleted from the heterozygote with pX63-HYG-Δodc to create the homozygousΔodc knockout null strain (designated ODCn/h). Electroporated parasites were maintained in liquid medium for 24 h before plating on a drug-containing semisolid medium. Drug-resistant clones transfected with pX63-NEO-Δodc were isolated from plates containing 20 μg/ml Geneticin (G418), whereas parasites transfected with pX63-HYG-Δodc were selected in 20 μg/ml G418, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and 100 μm putrescine. Colonies isolated after transfection with either pX63-NEO-Δodc or pX63-HYG-Δodc were picked into 1.0 ml of liquid DME-L containing the relevant selective and indispensable agents, expanded, and analyzed for the appropriate allelic replacements by Southern blotting. The ODC+/n and ODCn/h transformants were maintained continually in the appropriate selective media unless otherwise indicated. ODC activity was measured radiometrically as described previously (14Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody to purified L. donovani ODC was generated in rabbits by conventional methods (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Promastigotes were lysed by sonication, and cell supernatants were prepared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. 10 μg of protein from each cell line were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Semi-Dry Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad), and subjected to Western blot analysis by standard protocols (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 5.0 × 108parasites were harvested and extracted for polyamine pool determinations with 10% trichloroacetic acid as described previously (24Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar). An internal 1,7-diaminoheptane standard (40 μm) was then added to the trichloroacetic acid supernatants. The trichloroacetic acid was extracted with ethyl acetate as reported previously (24Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar), and the samples were dried on a Speed Vac concentrator. Samples were pre-column derivatized with dansyl chloride using previously reported protocols (25Rojas-Chaves M. Hellmund C. Walters R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), except that the sample volumes were 100 μl. 100 μl of 25% proline were added to scavenge excess dansyl chloride. The derivatized polyamines were recovered with two ethyl acetate extractions, and the organic layers were pooled and dried. Samples were resuspended in 200 μl of 95% methanol/5% acetic acid, and polyamines were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography on a Beckman system equipped with a C18reversed phase column (Bio-Rad) as described previously (25Rojas-Chaves M. Hellmund C. Walters R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Relative fluorescence was measured on a Shimadzu RF-535 fluorescence high performance liquid chromatography monitor at excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 485 nm, respectively. Peak areas were calculated using a Hewlett Packard HP3396 series II integrator and compared with those of known polyamine standards. 1.0 × 108 cells were prepared for thiol pool determinations and derivatized with monobromobimane as described previously (24Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar). Derivatized thiols were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography over a Vydac C18 reversed phase column as reported previously (26Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. Bacchi C.J. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Relative fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 395 and 480 nm, respectively. Peak areas were calculated as described for the polyamine pool determinations. 5 × 106 wild type promastigotes were incubated with 2 μCi of [14C]spermidine (113 mCi/mmol) or [14C]spermine (115 mCi/mmol) in 5 ml of DME-L-CS under normal growth conditions for 48 h. Polyamine pools were processed and chromatographed as described above. 1-ml fractions were collected, and radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The positions of the radiolabeled polyamines were determined by co-injection with polyamine standards. To disrupt the ODClocus, a single copy gene in L. donovani (14Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), each allele was sequentially replaced with a drug resistance cassette. The firstODC allele was displaced with pX63-NEO-Δodc to create the ODC+/n heterozygote, and the second was replaced with pX63-HYG-Δodc to create the null ODCn/hΔodc mutant. In each round of transfection, 4 × 107 promastigotes were transfected with the appropriate linearized DNA fragments, and ∼100 drug-resistant colonies were obtained from each plating. The homozygotes were selected in medium supplemented with 100 μm putrescine, because it has been established previously that pharmacologic simulation of a genetic deficiency of ODC in L. donovani by the incubation of intact parasites with DFMO could be circumvented by the addition of the diamine to the culture medium (9Kaur K. Emmett K. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Ullman B. J. Protozool. 1986; 33: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). G418 was also added to the hygromycin resistance selections to ensure that the second round of gene targeting yielded cell lines in which pX63-HYG-Δodchad replaced the wild type allele of the ODC+/nheterozygote. Southern blot analysis of the ODC+/+, ODC+/n , and ODCn/h strains revealed the new alleles that had been constituted by homologous gene replacement events (Fig. 2). These altered alleles could be effectively discriminated from the wild type allele by the positions of distinctSacI sites located within the endogenous ODClocus, pX63-NEO-Δodc, and pX63-HYG-Δodc (Fig.1). These allelic differences are demonstrated in Fig. 2. Digestion of genomic DNA prepared from ODC+/+, ODC+/n, and ODCn/h cells with SacI and hybridization with the 0.8-kb 5′-flanking probe 5′F (Fig. 1, Probe A) revealed only the expected wild type hybridization signals at 1.6 and 1.3 kb (Fig. 2 A). A novel 3.2-kb band was observed inSacI-digested genomic DNA from ODC+/n with a concomitant diminution of the hybridization intensity of the 1.6-kb signal from the 5′-flanking region of the wild type allele. A similar digestion of ODCn/h DNA showed the loss of the 1.6-kb fragment from the wild type allele and an increase in the hybridization signal at 3.2 kb. As expected from the restriction maps (Fig. 1), no changes in the 1.3-kb signal were observed (Fig. 2 A). A parallel digestion of genomic DNA with SacI-SalI and probing with the 2.0-kb 3′-flanking probe 3′F (Fig. 1, Probe B) also confirmed the presence of the new alleles in ODC+/n and ODCn/h cells and the disappearance of the wild type counterparts. The SacI-SalI band that hybridizes to 3′F is 2.3 kb (see Fig. 1), whereas the fragments from the alleles disrupted by pX63-NEO-Δodc and pX63-HYG-Δodc are 2.8 kb (Fig. 2 B). Finally, to establish that the drug-resistant clones were truly deficient inODC coding region sequences, genomic DNA from the three genotypes was digested with SalI and probed with a 1.3-kbBamHI-StuI fragment located within the protein coding portion of ODC (Fig. 1, Probe C). As anticipated, a 3.9-kb hybridization signal corresponding to the wild type allele was observed in the ODC+/+ line. The same fragment, exhibiting approximately half the signal intensity of the wild type 3.9-kb band, was observed in the ODC+/nheterozygote, whereas the band was absent in the ODCn/hknockout. It is worth noting that after both rounds of transfection, clones displaying genetic events other than simple gene replacements were detected by Southern blotting at a frequency of ∼20%, but these more complex genetic alterations were not analyzed further. To evaluate the phenotypic consequences of ODC replacement, ODC activity and protein were measured in wild type and genetically manipulated strains. As shown in Fig. 3, levels of ODC activity in ODC+/+, ODC+/n, and ODCn/h cells were directly proportional to the ODC copy number. ODC activity in the heterozygous deletion mutant was ∼50% that of wild type cells, and no ODC activity could be detected in the ODCn/h double knockout. Western blot analysis of ODC+/+, ODC+/n, and ODCn/h cell extracts demonstrated that the observed reduction in ODC activity in the single and double knockouts was consistent with diminished cellular expression of ODC protein (Fig. 4).Figure 4Western blot analysis of expressed ODC protein in wild type and mutant parasites. Polyclonal antiserum against L. donovani ODC was generated in rabbits and used to detect ODC protein in fractionated extracts obtained from exponentially growing ODC+/+, ODC+/n, and ODCn/hcells. Molecular mass markers are indicated on theright.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nutritional requirements of the Δodc parasites were also evaluated. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, the ODCn/h double knockout could not grow in DME-L medium in the absence of putrescine, whereas ODC+/n grew as proficiently as the ODC+/+ strain (data not shown). The addition of 200 μm putrescine to the culture medium averted the lethal consequences of ODC deficiency, and the growth rate of ODCn/h cells in the presence of putrescine was indistinguishable from that of the ODC+/+ and ODC+/n cell lines (Fig. 5). Putrescine did not affect the growth rate of either the ODC+/+ or ODC+/n cell lines. Parallel results were obtained with all three strains cultivated in DME-L-CS (data not shown). No morphological distinctions were noted among the three strains by light microscopy as long as ODCn/h cells were maintained in putrescine-supplemented medium. The cellular polyamine requirement in ODCn/h cells could also be satisfied by the provision of 200 μm spermidine, although supplementation of the medium with equimolar spermine, a concentration that did not affect the growth of ODC+/+parasites, did not support the growth of the knockout (Fig.6). The experiments establishing whether spermidine and spermine could overcome cellular ODC deficiency were conducted in DME-L-CS medium to avoid the polyamine toxicity attributable to the presence of minute amounts of polyamine oxidase activity in DME-L medium. Interestingly, the polyamine requirement of ODCn/h cells could also be fulfilled by supplementing DME-L-CS with either 1,3-diaminopropane or 1,5-diaminopentane (cadaverine) (Fig. 6). However, the growth rate of Δodc cells in DME-L-CS supplemented with either 1,3-diaminopropane or cadaverine was somewhat less than that in medium supplemented with putrescine, although the final cell densities were similar (data not shown). The ODCn/h cells could be propagated continuously in DME-L-CS supplemented with 200 μm concentrations of either putrescine, spermidine, 1,3-diaminopropane, or cadaverine for >6 months. TheΔodc parasites could not grow in DME-L-CS supplemented with other diamines, including 1,2-diaminoethane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 1,7-diaminoheptane, 1,8-diaminooctane, 1,10-diaminodecane, and 1,12-diaminododecane, at concentrations that were nontoxic to wild type parasites. The metabolic consequences of ODC deficiency on polyamine and thiol pools were also evaluated in Δodc cells. Thiol pools were measured, because Leishmania and other trypanosomatid protozoa contain millimolar concentrations of the spermidine-containing trypanothione molecule (27Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a thiol that likely serves as a general reductant in these parasites (28Henderson G.B. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As shown in TableI, exponentially growing wild type and ODC+/n cells contained commensurate concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, trypanothione, glutathionylspermidine, and glutathione. The intracellular putrescine and spermidine pools of theΔodc cells expanded in putrescine-supplemented medium were also comparable to those of wild type and ODC+/n cells, although the thiol concentrations were significantly higher. No spermine was detected in any of these cell lines, which is consistent with previous observations that L. donovani lack spermine (9Kaur K. Emmett K. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Ullman B. J.

In this study, we found that an early event in the cell membrane of myeloblastic leukemia (ML-1) cells was the vigorous activation of the voltage-gated K+ channel by UV irradiation. The strong enhancement by UV irradiation of K+ channel activity in the cell membrane subsequently activated the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway and resulted in myeloblastic leukemia cell apoptosis. Suppression of UV-induced K+ channel activation with specific channel blockers prevented UV-induced apoptosis through inhibition of UV-induced activation of the proteins SEK (SPAK kinase) and JNK. However, suppression of K+ channel activity could not protect cells from etoposide-induced apoptosis, which bypasses the membrane event. Elimination of extracellular Ca2+ had no effect on the UV-induced and K+ channel-mediated JNK/SAPK activation. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism in which activation of K+ channels by UV-irradiation upstream of SEK and SAPK/JNK mediates UV-induced myeloblastic cell apoptosis.

Exposure of mammalian cells to UV irradiation causes programmed cell death and cancers. Early responses to UV irradiation include the activation of transcription factors, Ap-1 and NF-κB (1Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. EXS (Basel). 1996; 77: 273-288PubMed Google Scholar, 2Herrlich P. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

This activation, which is known as the UV response, is mediated by activation of intracellular signaling pathways that are shared with growth factors.

UV irradiation strongly increases JNK/SAPK activity but only modestly increases Erk1/2 activity in opposed to growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (7Rosette C. Karin M.

Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Exposure to UV light induces clustering and internalization of cell surface receptors for epidermal growth factor, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin 1. Inhibition of clustering or receptor down-regulation attenuates the response to UV (7Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). UV irradiation induces ligand-independent activation of numerous receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor and insulin receptors, and protein-tyrosine kinases at the inner side of the plasma membrane (13Devary Y.

Other membrane-associated proteins, the protein-tyrosine phosphatases, can be inhibited with UV irradiation by targeting an essential -SH group in the tyrosine phosphatase. This results in inhibition of dephosphorylation and enhancement of autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (18Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated in enucleated cells that UV activation of NF-κB and JNK does not require a nuclear signal (19Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). These two observations, the full response of enucleated cells to UV irradiation and the involvement of membrane-associated proteins in the UV response, strongly suggest that important UV-induced cell events probably occur through initiation of conformational changes in the plasma membrane. Several recent studies have implied that potassium (K+) plays an important role in the regulation of programmed cell death. A bacterial pore-forming cytolysin, staphylococcal α-toxin, which selectively permeabilizes plasma membranes for monovalent ions, appeared to induce apoptosis (20Bhakdi S. Muhly M. Korom S. Hugo F. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3512-3519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, diminishing the normal K+ electrochemical gradient completely nullified the ability of the anti-Fas antibody to induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells (21Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells and shrunken cells have a much lower intracellular K+ concentration compared with normal cells (22Barbiero G. Duranti F. Bonelli G. Amenta J.S. Baccino F.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23Hughes Jr., F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30567-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both DNA autodigestion and nuclease activity of thymocytes are suppressed by an increase in extracellular K+ concentration in a dose-dependent manner. The complete inhibition can be reached at a concentration of 150 mm extracellular K+, close to the intracellular K+ concentration found in normal cells (23Hughes Jr., F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30567-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The question that naturally arises, then, is in regard to the existence of a relationship between K+ channel activity and UV irradiation-induced apoptosis in ML-1 cells. Because voltage-gated K+ channel activity involved in cell proliferation (24Lu L. Yang T. Markakis D. Guggino W.B. Craig R.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 132: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Xu B. Wilson B.A. Lu L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2037-C2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is regulated by growth factors (26Wang L. Xu B. White E.R. Lu L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1657-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is associated with Src-tyrosine kinase (27Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we propose that activation of the K+ channel can mediate UV irradiation-induced apoptosis. To address this hypothesis, we first observed the effects of UV-C light on the K+ channel in myeloblastic leukemia cells (ML-1) by using whole-cell and cell-attached patch recording techniques. Then, we investigated the role of K+ channels in UV-induced cell death. Finally, we examined the effect of K+ channel activity on UV-stimulated JNK pathway. Our results show that UV irradiation activated K+ channels at both whole-cell and single-channel levels. Blockade of K+ channels with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) almost completely prevented UV-induced apoptosis and suppressed UV-stimulated JNK pathway, indicating that UV-activated K+ channels do mediate apoptosis in myeloblastic leukemia cells. ML-1 cells originally isolated from an acute myeloblastic leukemia patient were received as a generous gift from Dr. R. W. Craig (Dartmouth Medical School, NH). All myeloblastic leukemia cells were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 culture medium containing 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 25 mm HEPES buffer. Cells were grown in suspension culture in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2, 37 °C. FDC-P1 murine myeloid progenitor cells were maintained by incubating at 37 °C (5% CO2) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES buffer, 0.0004% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10% conditioned medium from WEHI-3b cells as a source of interleukin 3. Patch pipettes with a resistance of 3–4 MΩ when filled with 150 mm KCl solution were manufactured with a two-stage puller (PP-83, Narishige). For whole cell K+ current recording, the nystatin perforated patch technique was used. The pipette tip was filled with a solution containing 140 mm KCl, 0.05 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmATP, 0.05 mm GTP, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 HEPES (titrated with KOH to pH 7.2). The remainder of the pipette was back-filled with the same pipette solution with the addition of 200 μg/ml nystatin. The bath solution was composed of 140 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Voltage-clamp experiments were carried out by using an Axopatch 200A patch-clamp amplifier, and data were collected and analyzed with pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Inc). For the cell-attached single channel patch clamp, solutions were 1) KCl bath solution containing 140 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; and 2) pipette solution containing 140 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Single-channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and filtered with a 4-pole low pass filter at 2 kHz and digitized at 22 kHz by a pulse-code modulator (A. R. Vetter, Rebersburg, PA). The pCLAMP program was used to analyze the single-channel data. Channel activity was determined as NP o, where N represents number of channels in the patch, and P o represents the probability of an open channel. All experiments were performed at room temperature (21 to 23 °C). Myeloblastic leukemia cells at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/ml were incubated with complete culture medium. K+ channel blockers were added into the culture medium to a final concentration of 2.0 mm. For UV irradiation experiments, cells were placed in a tissue culture hood at a distance of 60 inches from the UV-C light source and exposed at an intensity of 40 mW/cm2 for 3 to 8 min (60 to 72 J/m2). For exposure to etoposide (an apoptosis inducer), a stock solution of 10 mg/ml etoposide was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. After etoposide and UV treatments, cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 15 to 24 h. Cell viability was measured using the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Cell apoptosis was detected by DNA fragmentation and nuclear staining with ethidium bromide/acridine orange. To determine internuclosomal DNA cleavage, myeloblastic cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Lysis buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K) was added, and cells were then incubated for 4 h at 55 °C. The nuclear lysates were extracted twice with an equal volume of phenol and then extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). DNA was precipitated with 0.05 volumes of 5 m NaCl and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol, incubated overnight at −20 °C, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The DNA pellet was dried and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) containing 20 μg/ml RNase A and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The DNA was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels, and the results were visualized by staining with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide.PstI-digested λ DNA was used as a molecular weight marker. Nuclear staining with ethidium bromide and acridine orange was done by adding 2 μl of dye mixture containing 100 μg/ml each acridine orange and ethidium bromide to 25 μl of cell suspension. Cell populations were scored according to color using a UV-fluorescence microscope (Nikon). Nuclei staining green have not lost membrane integrity. In contrast, myeloblastic cells in which the nuclei stained orange have lost membrane integrity. Apoptotic cells can be distinguished from nonapoptotic cells on the basis of the absence or presence of nuclear condensation/fragmentation. SEK-1 (SPAK kinase 1) activity was determined by measuring the level of SEK-1 phosphorylation with Western blotting using monoclonal antibody (1:1000) against phosphorylated SEK-1 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). After proper treatments, 1 × 106 cells (5 × 105cells/ml) were lysed in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer. Western blotting was performed using the same protocol as described below. Phospho-SEK-1 levels were quantified by measuring film densities with a densitometer. JNK-1 and p38 activities were measured by an immunocomplex kinase assay with GST-ATF-2 as the substrate (28Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, 29Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Briefly, ML-1 cells (7 × 106 cells) were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and then were precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 25 min. JNK-1 or p38 proteins were immunoprecipitated with 0.5 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody against JNK-1 or p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The immunocomplex was washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer. One μg of GST-ATF-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to 30 μl of the immunocomplex. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 2 μl of ATP mixture (20 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reaction proceeded at room temperature for 5 min before it was terminated by adding 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 was visualized by autoradiography after SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ATF-2 phosphorylation was quantified by densitometry. JNK-1 or p38 protein levels were determined by Western blotting. Briefly, an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to 20 μl of immunocomplex and boiled for 5 min. After fractionation on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and incubated with the same antibodies (1:5000) used for JNK-1 or p38 immunoprecipitations. The membranes were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:10,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies were detected with a Phototope-Star Western blot detection kit (New England Biolabs). Changes in cell membrane K+ channel activity can mediate functional adaptation to a variety of chemical and physical stresses through membrane voltage stabilization and maintenance of salt and water balance. We found that cytokine-mediated stimulation of proliferation in myeloblastic ML-1 cells is associated with increases in K+ channel activity. This channel activity is sensitive to inhibition by 4-AP but less sensitive to inhibition by Ba2+ and tetraethyleneammonium (TEA) (24Lu L. Yang T. Markakis D. Guggino W.B. Craig R.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 132: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Using the nystatin-perforated whole cell technique, the whole-cell current was activated by depolarization of the membrane potential from a holding potential of −60 to +80 mV in 20-mV increments. Upon exposure of ML-1 cells to UV-C light for 1 min, the amplitude of the K+current increased markedly. UV-evoked K+ current was sensitive to 4-AP and was completely blocked by 2 mm 4-AP (Fig. 1, A and B). The time course showed that the amplitude of the K+ current doubled within 1 min after exposure to UV light and reached the maximal amplitude within 5 min. In the presence of 4-AP, UV stimulation of K+ currents was blocked, following the time course shown (Fig. 1 C).Figure 1Activation of a 4-AP-sensitive K+channel by UV irradiation. A, effect of UV-irradiation on the 4-AP-sensitive K+ current. Whole-cell currents were activated by exposure of ML-1 cells to UV light in the absence and presence of 4-AP. The membrane potential was depolarized from a holding potential of –60 mV to +80 mV at 20-mV increments. B, current-voltage relationship of the 4-AP-sensitive K+current activated by UV light. C, time course of UV-activated K+ current in the absence and presence of 4-AP. Currents were normalized asI UV/I C whereI UV and I C represent amplitudes of the K+ current measured before and after UV irradiation, respectively. D, single channel recording of K+ channel in ML-1 cells. Outward current recorded as an upward deflection was obtained from cell-attached patches at a membrane potential of −60 mV. UV-C irradiation was directly applied to the patch chamber to activate K+ channels in the same patch. The bottom trace demonstrates that UV irradiation induced an increase in K+ channel activity that was blocked by application of 100 μm 4-AP in the patch pipette. Channel activity (NP o) was plotted as a function of time in the lower panel. E, statistics of K+channel activity stimulated by UV irradiation and blocked by 100 μm 4-AP or by 20 mm TEA. Vertical bars represent mean K+ channel activity (horizontal bars represent S.E.). An asteriskrepresents a significant difference (statistical tests: ANOVA and Tukey, p < 0.001). Data were collected from seven independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm the effect of UV irradiation on single K+ channel activity, the cell-attached patch clamp was used. The single-channel current was recorded at a membrane potential of −60 mV in vivo (Fig. 1 D). Exposure to UV-C irradiation (∼45 J/m2) strongly stimulated K+channel activity (NP o). Activity increased from 9.6 ± 1.6% to 68.0 ± 5.6% within 30 s (Fig.1 E). In seven independent patches with 100 μm4-AP in the patch pipette, UV irradiation failed to activate K+ channel activity, and NP o remained unchanged at 12.2 ± 3.5% (Figs. 1, D andE). The addition of 20 mm TEA in the patch pipette reduced the UV-activated channel activity to 28.8 + 4.9% (n = 4, Fig. 1 E). These results suggest that an early effect of UV irradiation is the direct stimulation of cell membrane K+ channel activity in ML-1 cells. To determine whether UV-induced K+ channel hyperactivity is a component of the cell signaling pathway mediating UV-induced apoptosis, the effect of blocking K+ channel activity with the K+ channel inhibitor 4-AP was determined by measuring cell viability after UV irradiation in the presence or absence of 4-AP. In the presence of 2 mm 4-AP, cell viability was protected from UV irradiation (99.5 ± 0.5% for control, 96.1 ± 0.7% for 4-AP-treated, 32.0 ± 6.7% for UV-induced, and 92.6 ± 1.6% for UV plus 4-AP) (Fig.2 A). In contrast, 4-AP had no protective effect on cells treated with another apoptosis-inducer, etoposide (an inhibitor of topoisomerase II). With etoposide alone, viability decreased to 59.4 ± 3.2%. This decline was indistinguishable from the effect of etoposide measured in the presence of 4-AP (61.5 ± 0.4%) (Fig. 2 A). The protective effect of 4-AP on UV-induced cells was a time-dependent process. The addition of 4-AP before or at the onset of UV irradiation completely prevented cell death from UV irradiation. However, when 4-AP was added 5 s after the onset of UV irradiation, 30% of the cells died (Fig. 2 B). We also found that four other types of myeloblastic cells (FDC-P1, U937, HL-60, and Himeg-1) exhibited 4-AP-sensitive K+ channel activity (data not shown). After exposure of these cells to UV irradiation, their viabilities decreased to 57.7 ± 3.6%, 8.3 ± 0.6%, 27.0 ± 0.3%, and 31.0 ± 7.0%, respectively. The suppression of K+ channel activity with 4-AP had the same protective effect on UV-induced apoptosis in these cells as it did in ML-1 cells (Fig. 2 C). The effects of blocking channel activity on UV- and etoposide-induced cell death were evaluated using DNA fragmentation and nuclear staining methods. Suppression of K+ channel activity with 4-AP completely prevented UV-induced DNA fragmentation in ML-1 cells but did not prevent etoposide-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2 D). The suppression of UV-induced DNA fragmentation was also observed in four other myeloid leukemia cell lines (Fig. 2 E). The protective effect of 4-AP against UV- and etoposide-induced apoptosis was evaluated based on the extent of nuclear staining with ethidium bromide/acridine orange. Exposure of cells to UV irradiation and etoposide resulted in orange-stained nuclei indicating nuclear death (Fig. 2 F). Suppression of K+ channel activity with 4-AP protected the cells against UV irradiation-induced nuclear death, whereas it was ineffective in preventing etoposide-induced nuclear death. These results reveal that UV irradiation elicits K+ channel hyperactivity, which, in turn, mediates apoptosis. The ability of etoposide to induce apoptosis despite the presence of 4-AP is consistent with its known inhibition of topoisomerase II activity at the level of the nucleus. Many cells respond to UV irradiation by activating their JNK signaling pathway. To determine whether UV irradiation-induced K+ channel hyperactivity is an essential component in the UV-activated JNK signaling pathway, JNK-1 activity was measured after suppression of K+ channel activity. JNK-1 was strongly activated after 5 min of UV irradiation (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, activation of JNK-1 by UV irradiation was almost completely prevented when K+ channel activity was suppressed with 2 mm 4-AP. In addition, UV-induced JNK activation was partially inhibited, falling to 62 and 24% of its original activity when K+ channel activity was suppressed with either 10 mm TEA or 5 mm Ba2+, respectively (Fig. 3 A). The fact that 4-AP was the most potent protective agent is consistent with its rank as the most potent inhibitor of this particular type of K+ channel activity in these cells (24Lu L. Yang T. Markakis D. Guggino W.B. Craig R.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 132: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,26Wang L. Xu B. White E.R. Lu L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1657-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The suppression by 4-AP of K+ channel activity and of JNK-1 activation was dose-dependent and reached its maximum inhibitory effect at 1 mm (Fig. 3 B). The suppressive effect of 4-AP on UV-induced JNK activity closely corresponds to its dose-dependent inhibition of the K+ current in ML-1 cells (26Wang L. Xu B. White E.R. Lu L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1657-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SEK is a specific protein kinase in the JNK signaling cascade that phosphorylates and activates JNK (30Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 31Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). To confirm the involvement of UV-stimulated K+ channel hyperactivity in mediating events upstream from SEK, the relationship between the phosphorylation state of SEK and K+ channel activity was characterized. The SEK-1 protein was strongly phosphorylated after a 5-min exposure to UV irradiation (Fig. 3 C). Suppression of UV-induced K+ channel activity with either 4-AP or Ba2+inhibited SEK-1 phosphorylation by 70 and 16%, respectively. These results indicate that suppression of UV-induced K+ channel activity specifically inhibits the early events in the cell membrane upstream from JNK. Another stress-activated MAP kinase, p38, is also activated in response to UV irradiation (32Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Lee J.C. Holbrook N.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 33Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To test for K+ channel-mediated p38 activation in response to UV irradiation in ML-1 cells, the effect of UV irradiation was measured on p38 activity in the presence and absence of K+ channel blockers. Activation of p38 occurred irrespective of the presence or absence of 4-AP (Fig. 3 D). Our results strongly suggest that UV-stimulated K+ channel hyperactivity is an essential upstream component of the JNK signaling pathway; however, p38 activation is not linked to stimulation of K+ channel activity. The mechanism underlying UV-induced p38 activation and apoptosis remains to be elucidated. To further support the notion that 4-AP is not a nonspecific inhibitor of JNK pathways, we examined the effect of 4-AP on JNK-1 activation induced by hyperosmolarity in ML-1 cells. Hyperosmotic shock (600 mmsorbitol) strongly activated JNK-1. 4-AP had no effect on JNK activity (Fig. 4 A). This result indicates that 4-AP has a specific inhibitory effect on UV-induced JNK activation. In addition, it suggests that the effect of 4-AP on UV-induced JNK-1 activation is likely through blockage of K+ channel activity and that activation of JNK-1 by hyperosmotic shock in these cells may not be a K+ channel activity-mediated process. Recent studies have shown that an increase of Ca2+ influx may be a component of the signaling mechanism for mediating UV-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, we examined whether UV irradiation could induce JNK stimulation when extracellular Ca2+ concentration was reduced by the addition of EGTA. Our results showed that at a very low Ca2+ concentration (0.5 mm EGTA) or in a nominally Ca2+-free medium (5 mm EGTA) JNK activation still occurred in response to UV irradiation (Fig.4 B). In addition, suppression of K+ channel activity with 4-AP inhibited UV-induced JNK activation in Ca2+-free medium. Therefore, Ca2+ influx did not play a significant role in the JNK signaling pathway mediating UV-induced apoptosis in ML-1 cells. We provide evidence for a novel mechanism of UV irradiation-induced apoptosis in myeloblastic leukemia cells. An important early component of the signaling process mediating UV-induced apoptosis is strong activation of cell membrane K+channels. There is growing evidence showing that K+ channel activities are probably involved in programmed cell death. Various investigations have shown that K+ channel activity can be affected by apoptosis inducers, including reactive oxygen species (34Bright J. Khar J. Khar A.

The K+ channel blocker 4-AP inhibits the shrinkage of human eosinophils undergoing apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal (42Beauvais F. Michel L. Dubertret L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and a combination of two K+ channel blockers, TEA and 4-AP, inhibited interleukin 1b release from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes (43Walev I. Reske K. Palmer M. Valeva A. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Neurons undergoing apoptosis exhibited an up-regulation of outward K+currents. This enhancement of outward K+ current, induced by serum deprivation and staurosporine, can be prevented by the K+ channel blocker TEA and by increasing the extracellular K+ concentration. It has also been observed that the K+ channel opener cromakalim induces neuronal apoptosis (44Yu S.P. Yeh C.H. Sensi S.L. Gwag B.J. Canzoniero L.M. Farhangrazi Z.S. Ying H.S. Tian M. Dugan L.L. Choi D.W. Science. 1997; 278: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the activation of K+ channels is responsible for K+ efflux and the consequent membrane hyperpolarization and decrease in cell volume, thereby activating a particular signaling system leading to 1β-converting enzyme activation and apoptosis. The stimulation of K+ channel activity could result in the quick loss of intracellular K+. The loss of intracellular K+ activates interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (21Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 43Walev I. Reske K. Palmer M. Valeva A. Bhakdi S.

Some evidence suggests that interleukin 1β-converting enzyme can affect upstream events in the JNK pathway at the JNK level (46Cahill M.A. Peter M.E. Kischkel F.C. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Krammer P.H. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2087-2096PubMed Google Scholar). UV-induced activation of interleukin 1β-converting enzyme and JNK-1 could occur subsequent to the stimulation of K+ channel activity and the loss of intracellular K+. This mechanism has been implicated in apoptosis in neuronal cells (47Eldadah B.A. Yakovlev A.G. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Schulz J.B. Weller M. Klockgether T. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4696-4706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, cell shrinkage that occurs as a result of a quick fall in intracellular K+ concentration, may trigger apoptosis. Accordingly, suppression of K+ channel activity may prevent a quick loss of intracellular K+ ions resulting from UV-induced K+ channel hyperactivity. This possibility is supported by recent findings that UV irradiation-induced JNK activation can be mimicked by hypertonic stress in HeLa cells (7Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). In addition, cytokine receptors can be activated by either UV irradiation or hypertonic stress. It is speculated that cytokine receptor activation induced by hypertonic stress occurs as a consequence of cell shrinkage. UV-induced apoptosis in ML-1 cells is dependent on stimulation of SEK/JNK and p38 pathways in ML-1 cells. We found that activation of 4-AP-sensitive K+ channel activity occurs upstream from the stimulation of the SEK/JNK pathway and that p38 stimulation is a component of the cell signaling systems responsible for UV-induced apoptosis. Activity of p38, however, resides in a signaling pathway parallel to that of SEK/JNK, as shown by the observation that inhibition of K+ channel activity with 4-AP has no effect on p38 activity. This result suggests that p38 stimulation may not be linked to activation of this type of K+ channel activity. Our finding that UV-induced K+ channel hyperactivity precedes SEK and JNK stimulation documents for the first time a role for membrane ion channels in mediating radiation- and cytokine-induced signal transduction and apoptosis. This process, as well, has been shown to account for serum deprivation-induced neuronal cell apoptosis and occurs in the absence of Ca2+ influx across the cell membrane (44Yu S.P. Yeh C.H. Sensi S.L. Gwag B.J. Canzoniero L.M. Farhangrazi Z.S. Ying H.S. Tian M. Dugan L.L. Choi D.W. Science. 1997; 278: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Some studies have shown that JNK activation is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ influx (30Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Such an increase in Ca2+ influx could occur as a consequence of UV-induced stimulation of K+ channel activity, which increases the electrical driving force for Ca2+ influx through membrane hyperpolarization (26Wang L.

https://openalex.org/W2062392701,"Protonated aminosulfonate compounds directly inhibit connexin channel activity. This was demonstrated by pH-dependent connexin channel activity in Good's pH buffers (MES (4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid), HEPES, and TAPS (3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino]-1-propanesulfonic acid)) that have an aminosulfonate moiety in common and by the absence of pH-dependent channel activity in pH buffers without an aminosulfonate moiety (maleate, Tris, and bicarbonate). The pH-activity relation was shifted according to the pK a of each aminosulfonate pH buffer. At constant pH, increased aminosulfonate concentration inhibited channel activity. Taurine, a ubiquitous cytoplasmic aminosulfonic acid, had the same effect at physiological concentrations. These data raise the possibility that effects on connexin channel activity previously attributed to protonation of connexin may be mediated instead by protonation of cytoplasmic regulators, such as taurine. Modulation by aminosulfonates is specific for heteromeric connexin channels containing connexin-26; it does not occur significantly for homomeric connexin-32 channels. The identification of taurine as a cytoplasmic compound that directly interacts with and modulates connexin channel activity is likely to facilitate understanding of cellular modulation of connexin channels and lead to the development of reagents for use in structure-function studies of connexin protein. Protonated aminosulfonate compounds directly inhibit connexin channel activity. This was demonstrated by pH-dependent connexin channel activity in Good's pH buffers (MES (4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid), HEPES, and TAPS (3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino]-1-propanesulfonic acid)) that have an aminosulfonate moiety in common and by the absence of pH-dependent channel activity in pH buffers without an aminosulfonate moiety (maleate, Tris, and bicarbonate).

These data raise the possibility that effects on connexin channel activity previously attributed to protonation of connexin may be mediated instead by protonation of cytoplasmic regulators, such as taurine. Modulation by aminosulfonates is specific for heteromeric connexin channels containing connexin-26; it does not occur significantly for homomeric connexin-32 channels. The identification of taurine as a cytoplasmic compound that directly interacts with and modulates connexin channel activity is likely to facilitate understanding of cellular modulation of connexin channels and lead to the development of reagents for use in structure-function studies of connexin protein.

The decrease in junctional conductance is usually reversible with return of pHi to normal physiological values. The molecular mechanisms that underlie this modulation of connexin channel activity are unclear and may differ among connexin isoforms and cell types. It has been proposed that the modulation is due to direct protonation of connexin (8Spray D.C. Harris A.L. Bennett M.V.L.

In this study, we set out to investigate modulation of connexin channel activity as a function of pH, using in a reconstituted system connexin channels immunoaffinity-purified from native tissues. Channel activity was monitored using transport-specific fractionation (TSF) of liposomes into which connexin channels were reconstituted. Channel activity in this system was affected by changes in pH. To our surprise, the changes in channel activity were accounted for by the direct action of the protonated form of the aminosulfonate compounds used as pH buffers, rather than of proton concentration itself. There is no evidence for the direct action of pH alone on the activity of these connexin channels in this system in the absence of aminosulfonate compounds. The sensitivity to protonated aminosulfonates was connexin isoform-specific. Heteromeric channels containing connexin-26 (Cx26) in addition to connexin-32 (Cx32) were highly sensitive, whereas homomeric Cx32 channels were not. Taken together with recent work by others on the structural basis of pH sensitivity of connexin channels in cells, these data suggest testable hypotheses for cellular and molecular regulation of connexin channel activity. They also provide an opportunity for development of pharmacological and affinity reagents for structure-function studies of connexin channels. This is the first report of a noncovalent modulatory activity of a biological molecule on connexin channels (see Ref. 22Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol.

Egg phosphatidylcholine, bovine phosphatidylserine, azolectin (soybean l-phosphatidylcholine), and lissamine rhodamine B-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids.

Rat liver yields homomeric Cx32, and mouse liver yields heteromeric Cx32/Cx26. Homomeric Cx26 channels were not available from a native tissue source; because Cx26 forms heteromeric channels with Cx32, such a source would have to lack Cx32. Homomeric Cx32 can be obtained from rat liver because the Cx26 content of rat liver is very low. There is no wild-type animal for which the converse is true. It was occasionally possible to obtain fractions of connexin from mouse liver that varied in Cx32/Cx26 ratio by taking advantage of the finding that more Cx26 elutes from the immunobeads (along with Cx32) in the initial fractions than in later fractions. Except where noted, the heteromeric Cx32/Cx26 channels were from pooled elution fractions. Gel electrophoresis, blotting, and staining of blots were carried out as described in Ref. 27Bevans C.G.

The monoclonal antibody (M12.13) used in the immunoaffinity purification and for specific staining of Cx32 on Western blots is directed against a cytoplasmic domain of Cx32 (28Goodenough D.A.

Because all TSF experiments were carried out at 37 °C, the pK a values for each compound used in calculations of protonated aminosulfonate concentrations were those either measured at 37 °C (TAPS, 6.0; HEPES, 7.1; MES, 8.1 (29Research Organics, Inc 1996/7 Catalog of Biochemicals. Research Organics, Inc., Cleveland, OH1996Google Scholar)) or calculated from the value at 25 °C and the measured enthalpy of ionization (taurine, 8.78 (30Christensen J.J. Hansen L.D. Izatt R.M. Handbook of Proton Ionization Heats and Related Thermodynamic Quantities. Wiley-Interscience, New York1976Google Scholar)). Unless otherwise noted, the pK a values given in the text are those at 37 °C. Liposome formation and protein incorporation followed the protocol of Mimms et al. (31Mimms L.T. Zampighi G.A. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) as modified by Harris et al. (32Harris A.L. Walter A. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Rhee et al. (26Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Liposomes were formed by gel filtration of a 1 mg/ml mixture of PC, PS, and rhodamine-labeled PE at a molar ratio of 2:1:0.03 in urea buffer (see below) containing 80 mm octylglucoside and immunoaffinity-purified connexin. The size of the liposomes was monodisperse with an approximate mean diameter of 900 Å, shown by HPLC gel filtration (33Ollivon M. Walter A. Blumenthal R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The protein/lipid ratio of the liposomes was typically 1:60 (w/w), corresponding to an amount of connexin equivalent to <∼1 hemichannel per liposome (see under “Data Analysis,” below). Minor variation in the amount of protein used, the amount damaged in purification, the reconstitution efficiency, and the amount of lipid retained on the column produced variations in the percentage of liposomes containing active channels under standard conditions. The protein/lipid ratios used yielded functional channels in 30–50% of the liposomes. The procedure used to fractionate liposomes into two populations based on sucrose-permeability is described and fully characterized in Harris et al. (32Harris A.L. Walter A. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Harris A.L. Walter A. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Rhee et al. (26Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The principle of using a density shift to fractionate liposomes was adapted from Goldin and Rhoden (35Goldin S.M. Rhoden V. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2575-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liposomes containing functional channels are separated from liposomes without functional channels by TSF achieved by centrifugation through an isoosmotic density gradient formed by urea and sucrose solutions. Urea buffer contained 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 3 mm sodium azide, and 459 mm urea at pH 7.6. Sucrose buffer was identical except that an osmotically equivalent concentration of sucrose (400 mm) replaced the urea. Osmolality of urea and sucrose buffers was 500 mosmol/kg, and their specific gravities (d 420) 1.0056 and 1.0511. An aliquot of liposomes was layered on each 4.4 ml gradient. Gradients were centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 2–3 h in a swinging bucket rotor (Sorvall TST 60.4) at 37 °C. Liposome bands were recovered by aspiration. The distribution of the liposomes in the gradient was calculated from the specific intensity of rhodamine fluorescence (Perkin-Elmer 650–10S or L550B spectrofluorometer; 560 nm excitation; 590 nm emission) and the volume of each collected band. During the centrifugation, liposomes without functional channels move into the gradient a short distance, being buoyed by the (lighter) entrapped urea buffer and form a band in the upper part of the gradient. Liposomes with functional channels continuously equilibrate their internal solution with the external solution and move to a position in the lower part of the gradient corresponding to the density of the liposome phospholipid membrane. Equilibration of extraliposomal and intraliposomal osmolytes is rapid (milliseconds for these 900-Å-diameter liposomes). Therefore, even a channel that opens only infrequently for brief times will mediate full exchange of osmolytes and cause liposome movement to the characteristic lower position. Calculations show that the assay is insensitive to large changes in channel P o down to 0.001. It is formally possible that a modulatory compound could affect the proportion of liposomes that shift to the lower position by restricting the diameter of the pores, rather than moving P oclose to 0. However, for this to occur, the channels would have to become impermeable to urea and to sucrose (liposomes permeable to urea only move to an intermediate position (36Harris A.L. Bevans C.G. Werner R. Gap Junctions. IOS Press, Amsterdam1997: 60-64Google Scholar, 37Bevans C. Brutyan R.A. DeMaria C. Harris A.L. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A204Google Scholar)). Such a change in diameter would effectively eliminate the ability of connexin channels to mediate molecular signaling between cells and therefore can be regarded as a decrease in channel activity. Previous work with the TSF system suggested that the channels distribute among the liposomes in a manner described by the Poisson distribution (26Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This means that for a given protein-lipid ratio (λ) in the liposomes, a Poisson distribution accounts for the fraction of the liposomes that have functional channels. When λ is small, essentially all of the liposomes in which there are channels contain exactly one channel. However, as λ increases, the fraction of liposomes with two or more channels increases. When this is the case, a change in the fraction of liposomes in the lower TSF band does not reflect exactly the change in channel activity (e.g. liposomes with two channels will move to the lower band unless both channels are closed by a given concentration of ligand). This leads to an underestimate of the inhibitory effect of a test condition, which was corrected in the following manner: λ was estimated from the maximum activity (percentage of liposomes with active channels) for a given preparation of liposomes. Using the Poisson distribution, this λ was used to calculate the distribution of channels in the liposome population, which was used to compensate for the error introduced by some of the liposomes containing more than one channel. This calculation transforms the fraction of permeable liposomes in a population into an index of discrete single channel activity. For each preparation of connexin, the percentage of liposomes in the lower band of TSF data was normalized to the maximum value obtained for that preparation. The maximum value was almost always at the highest pH value for the series. This enabled comparison of modulatory effects across reconstitutions that produced different amounts of channel activity (fractions of liposomes with functional channels). Where several preparations were used, normalized data sets were combined for each buffer for calculation of means and standard errors. The activity data was fit with a four-parameter logistic function of the form f(x) = a/(1 + exp(b*(x −c))) + d using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm. A Hill equation was not used because the TSF-pH data does not arise from a titration curve, but rather from the superimposition of responses of an unknown number of channel forms with different properties. For this reason, a smooth function was fit to the data to determine a characteristic half-maximal channel activity parameter. Channel activity data was modeled assuming that protonated taurine binds to one or more sites on a connexin hemichannel to inhibit channel activity. The calculations assume: 1) the pK a37 °C of taurine is 8.78 (30Christensen J.J. Hansen L.D. Izatt R.M. Handbook of Proton Ionization Heats and Related Thermodynamic Quantities. Wiley-Interscience, New York1976Google Scholar), 2) the Cx32/Cx26 channel population consists of five equal subpopulations each having a different taurine dissociation constant (K d) or cooperativity (n Hill), and 3) channels withP o < 0.001 are binned as closed by the TSF. At each protonated taurine concentration the fraction of active channels is summed over all the subpopulations. Because the number of subpopulations, the way that the K d orn Hill values are distributed, and theP o cutoff value are not known, these calculations only demonstrate the general adequacy of the model rather than provide estimates of binding parameters. For each subpopulation of channels, a P o versus [protonated taurine] relation was calculated from a standard binding isothermK dn/(K dn + [protonated taurine]n) where K d is the dissociation constant and n is n Hillas defined above. The binning of the liposomes into active and inactive populations by the TSF was simulated according to (3Liu S. Taffet S. Stoner L. Delmar M. Vallano M.L. Jalife J. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1422-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) above, giving a step function in the activityTSF versus[protonated taurine] relation for each subpopulation. For different binding parameters the step occurs at different [protonated taurine]. Summing the activityTSF versus [protonated taurine] step functions for each subpopulation produces an aggregate activityTSF versus [protonated taurine] relation that is a series of steps. The binding parametersK d or n Hill were adjusted so that the relation approximated the TSF data. Connexin was immunopurified from octylglucoside-solubilized crude plasma membranes from rat and mouse liver using a monoclonal antibody specific for Cx32, as previously described and characterized (26Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol.

American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1994: 197-224Google Scholar). Earlier biochemical and functional studies have characterized connexin purified in this way from rat liver as homomeric Cx32 hemichannels, and that from mouse liver as heteromeric Cx32/Cx26 hemichannels. The heteromeric channels are functionally heterogeneous with regard to permeability to large molecules, presumably due to heterogeneities of isoform stoichiometry and/or arrangement (27Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The activities of channels formed by Cx32 and Cx32/Cx26 were explored and compared by TSF of liposomes. TSF has been well characterized (32Harris A.L. Walter A. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,34Harris A.L. Walter A. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol.

A. 1982; 79: 4025-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, connexin channels are incorporated into the membranes of unilamellar liposomes. When centrifuged in an appropriate isoosmolar density gradient, solute exchange through active channels causes liposomes to become more dense and move to a position deep in the gradient. Liposomes without active channels remain in the upper part of the gradient. Any significant channel open probability (P o) results in sufficient osmolyte exchange to cause the change in density. Because the change in liposome density can result from brief channel openings, only when P ochanges above or below a very low value are changes in channel activity detected by TSF. TSF is therefore an essentially all-or-none assay of per-liposome channel activity. The technique is more fully described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effects of test compounds on channel activity were assessed by exposing connexin-containing liposomes to the compounds during a TSF spin. The change in distribution of liposomes between the upper and lower positions, relative to a control gradient without the compound, is a quantitative measure of the fractional change in activity of the population of the channels. To assess the effects of pH on immunopurified, reconstituted connexin channels, activity was assessed in TSF gradients in which the pH was adjusted by addition of strong acid or base. In these initial studies, the reference condition was pH 7.6 in 10 mm HEPES. Activity was assessed at pH 5 and pH 9 and normalized to that at the reference condition. Experiments were carried out using homomeric Cx32, and two fractions of a population of heteromeric Cx32/Cx26 channels with different ratios of Cx32 to Cx26. The Cx32/Cx26 channels were sensitive to pH changes over this range, whereas the homomeric Cx32 channels were essentially insensitive (Fig.1). Furthermore, the Cx32/Cx26 channel population with the greater proportion of Cx26 was more sensitive than that with less Cx26. Thus, pH sensitivity correlated with Cx26 content. These results suggest that Cx26 is directly responsible for the sensitivity to pH or indirectly confers pH sensitivity on the heteromeric connexin channels. The pH-induced loss of activity with decreased pH in this system is fully reversible, as it is in cells. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, the one-half maximal effect was near the pK a of HEPES, the pH buffer in the solutions. To test whether the pH sensitivity was buffer-specific, other pH buffers were used in place of HEPES in the TSF solutions, all at 10 mm. In MES and TAPS, the Cx32/Cx26 channels showed pH effects similar to those seen in HEPES. However, the pH range over which channel activity declined was different for each pH buffer (Fig.2, filled symbols). A smooth function was fit to each data set to define half-maximum values for activity in each buffer. It was found that the half-maximum activity value in each buffer was displaced toward the pK a of that buffer (see Fig. 3). Half-maximum values for MES, HEPES, and TAPS were at pH 6.1, 7.3, and 8.5, respectively, close to the corresponding buffer pK avalues of 6.0, 7.3, and 8.1 (29Research Organics, Inc 1996/7 Catalog of Biochemicals. Research Organics, Inc., Cleveland, OH1996Google Scholar, 30Christensen J.J. Hansen L.D. Izatt R.M. Handbook of Proton Ionization Heats and Related Thermodynamic Quantities.

(All TSF experiments were carried out at 37 °C, and all pK a values given are at that temperature.)Figure 3Chemical structures of the pH buffers.MES, HEPES, and TAPS are commonly used Good buffers (41Good N.E.

They share the common structural motif of a protonatable amine moiety that is separated from an ionized sulfonate moiety by two or three methylene groups. This functional motif derives from the naturally occurring precursor compound, the β amino acid taurine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furthermore, pH buffers that were not in this chemical family, such as maleate and Tris (Fig. 2, open symbols) and bicarbonate (not shown), elicited no change in channel activity over the same pH range. The pH buffers in which activity was pH-dependent were all Good buffers (41Good N.E. Winget G.D. Winter W. Connolly T.N. Izawa S. Singh R.M.M. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar) and are all aminosulfonate compounds (Fig. 3). Chemical precursors of the Good buffers include the non-aminosulfonates 2-bromoethanesulfonate, isethionate, and 2-propanesulfonate. These compounds, and the amino acid glycine, were tested and were without effect. The data in Figs. 1 and 2 strongly suggest that the observed changes in connexin channel activity are not due to protonation of connexin, but to the action of protonated aminosulfonate compounds on connexin channels that contain Cx26. The data in Fig. 2 could be accounted for if either the deprotonated aminosulfonate acts as a channel agonist or protonated aminosulfonate acts as a channel antagonist. To help distinguish these possibilities, channel activity was assessed at pH 7.6 in 50 mm rather than 10 mm HEPES. At the higher concentration, channel activity was reduced to the level of activity at 10 mm HEPES at low pH (i.e. when it is fully protonated) (Fig. 2, asterisk). This indicates that the protonated (zwitterionic) form of aminosulfonate buffers acts as a channel antagonist, since in this experiment the concentrations of both the protonated and deprotonated species were increased equally. This point is made more rigorously in the following experiment. The amino acid taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), a chemical precursor of the Good buffers, is an aminosulfonate and also can function as a pH buffer. Activity of Cx32/Cx26 channels was assessed in 10 mm taurine solutions adjusted to pH values from 7 to 10.5 (Fig. 4 A, open circles). A smooth function fit to the data (curved line) shows that the half-maximum value for activity modulation by taurine approximates the pK a value for taurine, consistent with the findings for the other aminosulfonate buffers (Fig. 2).

The finding that crude B. jararaca venom could prevent the binding of human recombinant rα2I domain to type I collagen led us to study jararhagin further. Synthetic peptides representing hydrophilic and charged sequences of jararhagin, including the RSECD sequence replacing the well known RGD motif in the disintegrin-like domain, were synthesized. Although the disintegrin-like domain derived peptides failed to inhibit rα2I domain binding to collagen, a basic peptide from the metalloproteinase domain proved to be functional. In an in vitro assay, the cyclic peptide, CTRKKHDNAQC, was shown to bind strongly to human recombinant α2I domain and to prevent its binding to type I and IV collagens and to laminin-1. Mutational analysis indicated that a sequence of three amino acids, arginine-lysine-lysine (RKK), is essential for rα2I domain binding, whereas the mutation of the other amino acids in the peptide had little if any effect on its binding function. Importantly, the peptide was functional only in the cyclic conformation and its affinity was strictly dependent on the size of the cysteine-constrained loop. Furthermore, the peptide could not bind to α2I domain in the absence of Mg2+, suggesting that the conformation of the I domain was critical, as well. Cells could attach to the peptide only if they expressed α2β1integrin, and the attachment was inhibited by anti-integrin antibodies. Integrin α2 subunit forms in the complex with the β1 subunit a cell surface receptor binding extracellular matrix molecules, such as collagens and laminin-1.

Integrins α1β1 and α2β1 are the major cellular receptors for native collagens (for review, see Refs. 1Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). Like all integrins their interaction with ligands is dependent on divalent cations (3Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The α1 and α2 subunits contain an special inserted domain, the I domain, resembling the A domain founde.g. in von Willenbrand factor (4Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It is evident that α1I and α2I domains are responsible for the primary recognition of collagen by the corresponding integrins (5Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kern A. Briesewitz R. Bank I. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22811-22816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two other ligands for α2β1 integrin, namely laminin-1 and echovirus-1, each bind to α2I domain, as well. However, echovirus-1 seems to recognize a different site on the α2I domain than the matrix proteins do (7Bergelson J.M. Chan B.M. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The binding sites of α1β1 and α2β1 integrins in collagens have been localized to the triple helical areas of the molecules (8Eble J.A. Golbik R. Mann K. Kuhn K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Gullberg D. Gehlsen K.R. Turner D.C. Ahlen K. Zijenah L.S. Barnes M.J. Rubin K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3865-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). One peptide sequence derived from the collagen α chain has been reported to block integrin-collagen interaction (10Staatz W.D. Fok K.F. Zutter M.M. Adams S.P. Rodriguez B.A. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7363-7387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in many studies it has been ineffective and it probably does not represent the actual binding site in collagen (11Cardarelli P.M. Yamagata S. Taguchi I. Gorcsan F. Chiang S.L. Lobl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23159-23164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pfäff M. Aumailley M. Specks U. Knolle J. Zrewes H.G.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More likely, collagen-receptor integrins recognize amino acid residues in more than one α chain. In type IV collagen-α1β1 integrin interaction, the importance of one arginine and two aspartic acid residues, all from different α chains, has been indicated (8Eble J.A. Golbik R. Mann K. Kuhn K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). One model of collagen binding to α2I domain suggests the interaction of a glutamate residue on the collagen surface with Mg2+ in α2I domain (14Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The recognition of collagen must, however, include the interaction of several other amino acids. In the structure-function analysis of other integrins, the use of short integrin binding peptides have been of great importance. Peptides binding to α2I domain have so far not been available. Venoms from several snake species contain disintegrin proteins, which block platelet integrin function and are responsible for the anticoagulation effect of the venoms. Many disintegrins harbor the RGD motif and inhibit the function of platelet αIIbβ3 and αVβ3integrins. However some toxins, such as jararhagin and catrocollastatin, have a disintegrin-like domain that differs from the disintegrin peptides found in crotalid and viperid venoms by the nature of their different disulfide bond structure and the fact that the RGD motif is replaced by an XXCD disulfide-bonded cysteinyl sequence (with X being any amino acid). Jararhagin (15Paine M.J.I. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D.G. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a potent inhibitor of platelet adhesion to collagen and its effect is based on the inhibition of α2β1 integrin function (16De Luca M. Ward C.M. Ohmori K. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of its action has been unknown. Intact jararhagin is cleaved in the snake venom-producing jaracetin, the disintegrin-like domain of jararhagin. The fate of the metalloproteinase domain after this cleavage is not known. Integrin α2β1 can also interact with jaracetin, but the interaction seems to be weaker than with jararhagin (16De Luca M. Ward C.M. Ohmori K. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here, we show that a short, cyclic peptide derived from the metalloproteinase domain of jararhagin binds strongly to human recombinant α2I domain and is a potent inhibitor of its interaction with collagens I and IV and laminin-1. Peptides corresponding to other regions of the jararhagin sequence, including the RSECD sequence analogous to the RGD region, had no effect. Our studies reveal a novel integrin binding sequence, RKK. The role of RKK motif in jararhagin function remains to be shown, but the peptides create new opportunities for structural studies on α2β1 integrin. The sequence of human α2I domain was aligned with the sequences of the available I domain x-ray structures: the I domain of human integrin αMβ2 with bound Mg2+ at 2.0 Å resolution (17Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and the human αLβ2 I-domain with bound Mn2+ at 1.8 Å resolution (18Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar); using the alignment programs MALIGN and MALFORM (19Johnson M.S. Overington J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 716-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 20Johnson M.S. May A.C.W. Rodionov M.A. Overington J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 575-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this alignment, the α2I domain was modeled using the programs COMPOSER (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO, USA) and MODELLER 4.0 (21Sali A. Blundell T.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10561) Google Scholar) a kind gift of Andrej Sali, Rockefeller University. From the sequence of the metalloprotease domain of Bothrops jararaca the three-dimensional model was built using the same methods as in the modeling of the α2I domain above. The model was based on the x-ray structure of Adamalysin II fromCrotalus adamanteus at 2.0 Å resolution (22Gomis-Reuth F.X. Kress L.F. Bode W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The models were energy minimized in SYBYL 6.3 (Tripos Associates, St Louis, MO, USA) using the TRIPOS force field. In the first application of energy minimization, the backbone was kept rigid and only the side chains were allowed to move. In the second step, all atoms were allowed to move. Energy minimization was performed until all short contacts and inconsistencies in geometry were rectified. The electrostatic term was not included, as the main purpose was to remove sterical hindrances and to correct bad geometry. The conformational flexibility of the original cyclic peptide in the cyclic form was assessed using molecular dynamics simulations. The starting conformation of the peptide was taken from the metalloproteinase model structure, cysteines were added to each end, and a disulfide bond was created between them. Peptides derived from the metalloproteinase were first minimized to remove atom-atom clashes and further refined by molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations were performed in vacuum at 300,000 and consisted of 20 pS equilibration followed by a 200 pS production run. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to constrain the lengths of all bonds between heavy atoms and hydrogen atoms to allow longer 1 femtosecond time step to be used. Electrostatics were excluded, because small peptides tend to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds to make the structure globular, especially when many charged residues are present within a peptide. All calculations were made using SYBYL 6.3 and the TRIPOS force field using an Onyx II workstation. DNA encoding the α2I domain was generated by polymerase chain reaction using human integrin α2cDNA as a template (integrin α2 cDNA was a gift from Dr. M. Hemler, Dana-Farber, Boston; Ref. 27Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The forward primer was 5′-CACAGGGATCCCCTGATTTTCAGCTC-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-GTGGCTGAATTCAACAGTACCTTCAATG-3′. Primers were designed to introduce two restriction sites into the product: a BamHI site at the 5′-end and an EcoRI site at the 3′-end. Polymerase chain reaction product and pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were digested with BamHI and EcoRI, ligated, and transformed into Escherichia coli DHα5F′ cells. Plasmid having the α2I domain insert (pJKα2I) was then sequenced and transformed into E. coli BL21 for production of recombinant protein rα2I. Production and purification of glutathione S-transferase-rα2I fusion protein were carried out as follows: typically, 400 ml Luria Bertaini medium (carbenicillin, 50 μg/ml) was inoculated with 40 ml of overnight culture of BL21/pJKα2I and the culture was grown for 1 h at 37 °C. Then an inducer, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration 0.1 mm), was added for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; rα2I, recombinant integrin α2I domain. pH 7.4. Suspensions were sonicated, centrifuged, and the supernatant was retained. Pellets were resuspended in PBS, sonicated and centrifuged a further two times, and the supernatants were pooled. Glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the resulting lysate and incubated at room temperature for 30 min by gently agitating. The lysate was centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and glutathione-Sepharose with bound fusion protein was transferred onto the suitable column. The column was then washed with 10 volumes of PBS, and the fusion protein was eluted with glutathione eluting buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein was cleaved with the protease thrombin (Pharmacia) (10 units) for at least 2 h at room temperature and dialyzed against PBS to remove glutathione. The cleavage mixture was passed down the glutathione-Sepharose column a second time to remove glutathione S-transferase. rα2I was collected from the flowthrough. It was necessary to treat the recombinant protein with 5 mm dithiothreitol to allow proper folding, because extra bands were seen without the treatment when analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The recombinant α2I domain produced was 223 amino acids long having two nonintegrin amino acids at the amino-terminal (GS), amino acids corresponding to α2integrin sequence 124–339 (PDFQ … IEGTV) and six nonintegrin amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal (EFIVTD). Labeling of rα2I with europium was carried out as follows: 120 volume 1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.5) was added to the purified rα2I to elevate the pH for labeling with isothiocyanate. The europium-labeling reagent (Wallac) was added at a 100-fold molar excess and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The unbound label was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G50/Sepharose 6B column (Pharmacia), and fractions containing the labeled protein were pooled. A sensitive rα2I binding assay based on the use of europium-labeled rα2I was developed. The coating of a 96-well immunoplate (Maxisorp, Nunc) was done by exposure to 0.1 ml of PBS containing 150 μg/ml (5 μg/cm2) type I collagen (bovine dermal, Cellon), type IV collagen (Sigma), laminin-1 (purified from basement membranes of the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor, Collaborative Research), fibronectin (human plasma fibronectin, Boehringer Mannheim), or 3.3 μg/ml echovirus-1 or echovirus-7 for 12 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, peptides and B. jararaca venom (Sigma) or purified jararhagin or jaracetin (a kind gift to us from Dr. Berndt, Baker Medical Research Institute, Australia) were coated at various concentrations on 96-well amine binding plates (Costar) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual protein absorption sites on all wells were blocked with 0.1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Echovirus-1 (Farouk strain) and -7 (Wallace) were obtained from the ATCC. They were propagated in LLC Mκ2 cells and purified using the method described by Abraham and Colonno (23Abraham G. Colonno R.J. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 340-345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified viruses were diluted in PBS containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and stored at −70 °C until used. Europium-labeled rα2I was added at a concentration of 500 ng/ml in PBS, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1 mg/ml BSA to the coated wells and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Wells were then washed three times with PBS, 2 mm MgCl2. Delfia enhancement solution (0.1 ml) (Wallac) was added to each well, and the europium signal was measured by fluorometry (Model 1232 Delfia, Wallac). In some experiments, anti-α2 integrin antibody 12F1 (24Pischel K.D. Hemler M.E. Huang C. Bluestein H.G. Woods V.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 226-233PubMed Google Scholar) was used. For the virus binding assays, EV1 was metabolically labeled with culture medium containing [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radioactively labeled virus (20,000 cpm) was allowed to bind 3 h in PBS, 2 mm MgCl2. The wells were washed three times, and the bound radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac). When peptides were added endogenously, the lyophilized peptides were solubilized directly with europium-labeled rα2I, 500 ng/ml in PBS, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, and then added to the wells. When EDTA was used instead of MgCl2, europium-labeled rα2I was diluted with PBS, 2 mm EDTA, and subsequent washes were performed with this buffer. The jararhagin-derived peptides were designed based on the secondary structure prediction of the jararhagin amino acid sequence. Secondary structure prediction was performed using the PeptideStructure program from the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) Software package (Madison, WI). Surface probability according to the Emini method (25Emini E.A. Hughes J.V. Perlow D.S. Boger J. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 836-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hydrophilicity according to the Kyte-Doolittle method (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) were taken into account. The peptides were synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems 431A) usingN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl chemistry. The peptides for the alanine substitution series were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). After synthesis, the peptides were oxidized to form disulfide bridges. The peptides were solubilized at 1 mg/ml concentration with 0.1 m ammonium carbonate buffer and incubated for 16–24 h at 4 °C. The oxidation was checked with reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and the oxidized peptides were lyophilized. In the 261ox peptide, the carboxyl-terminal cysteinyl residue was protected with an acetoamidomethyl group, and the cysteinyl residues at positions 1 and 8 were protected with trityl groups that were removed during cleavage of the peptide from the resin. The isoelectric points (pI) of the various peptides were also determined from the primary sequence using the isoelectric program from the Genetics Computer Group software package. Peptide 225ox was found to have a similar isoelectric point as 229ox and was therefore chosen to be the control peptide in some experiments. Biotinylation of 229ox was carried out as follows: lyophilized 229ox peptide was solubilized in PBS and 15 volume 0.1 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.0) was added to elevate the pH for biotinylation. Sulfobiotin-NHS (Calbiochem) was added 1:2 (w/w) 229ox:biotin and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. 110 volume 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was added to stop the biotinylation reaction. For the binding assays using biotinylated 229ox peptide, 96-well amine binding plates (Costar) were coated with various concentrations of rα2I domain- or rα2I domain-derived peptides according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual protein absorption sites on all wells were blocked with 0.1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. 100 μm biotinylated 229ox in PBS, 2 mmMgCl2 and 1 mg/ml BSA was added to the coated wells and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Wells were then washed three times with PBS, 2 mm MgCl2 and europium-labeled streptavidin (Wallac) was added at a concentration of 500 ng/ml in PBS, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Wells were again washed three times. 0.1 ml of Delfia enhancement solution (Wallac) was added to each well, and the europium signal was measured by fluorometry (Model 1232 Delfia, Wallac). When EDTA was used instead of MgCl2, europium-labeled rα2I was diluted with PBS, 2 mm EDTA, and subsequent washes were performed with this buffer. Human blood was obtained from healthy donors who had not taken any medication within the previous ten days. Blood samples were drawn into a Becton Dickinson Vacutainer 228 containing 0.129 m sodium citrate. The tube was then centrifuged 250 × g for 10 min and the platelet-rich plasma was transferred to a clean tube. Platelet aggregation was conducted at 37 °C in an aggregometer (Payton, CO). 450 μl of platelet-rich plasma was preincubated 3 min at 37 °C, and platelet aggregation was quantified by measuring the total amplitude of aggregation at a predetermined time interval following the addition of 50 μl of 2 mg/ml collagen (Sigma). To assay the ability of the synthetic peptides to inhibit platelet aggregation, the antagonists were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2 immediately before use. The antagonist solution was preincubated with platelet-rich plasma for 4 min at 37 °C before collagen stimulation. The extent of inhibition of platelet aggregation was assessed by comparison with the maximal aggregation induced by collagen and then expressed as a precentage. Human osteogenic cell line SAOS-2 (American Type Culture Collection) were used. HACAT cells are immortalized human keratinocytes originally obtained from Dr. N. E. Fusenig (DKFZ, Heidelberg). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Integrin α2 cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 1–4559 in the published sequence (27Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Hemler (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, MA). cDNA was ligated into the pAWneo2 expression vector (a kind gift from Dr. A. Weiss, University of California San Francisco; Ref. 28Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Van den Elsen P. Yanagi Y. Yoshikai Y. Calman A.F. Terhorst C. Stobo J.D. Weiss A. Nature. 1985; 316: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which carries the spleen focus-forming virus long terminal repeat promoter and a neomycin-resistant gene. Stable transfections were carried out using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 400 μg/ml neomycin analogue G418 was added to the culture media. After 2–3 weeks of selection, the nontransfected control cells were dead, and G418 resistant clones were isolated and analyzed for their expression of α2 integrin mRNA and protein. The coating of a 96-well amine binding plate (Costar) with 5 μg/cm2 (150 μg/ml) type I collagen (bovine dermal, Cellon) or the various peptides at the concentrations indicated was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual protein absorption sites on all wells were blocked with 0.1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were detached by using 0.01% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Trypsin activity was inhibited by washing the cells with 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.1% glycine. When antibodies (anti-β1(Mab13, Becton Dickinson), anti-α2 (5E8 a kind gift from Dr. Bankert, Roswell Park Cancer Institute)) or peptides were added the cells were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature before transfer to the wells. 10,000 cells were transferred to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing the wells once with PBS. Adherent cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol, and washed with distilled water. The bound stain was dissolved in 10% acetic acid and measured spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. The human recombinant integrin α2I domain (rα2I) was produced in E. coli and purified. The recombinant protein was at least 90% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and only a single band was observed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). To further characterize the recombinant protein, the amino-terminal sequence of the purified product was determined and found to be correct (GSPDF). rα2I was labeled with europium and used in solid-phase ligand binding assays. rα2I bound type I collagen, type IV collagen, and laminin-1, although its binding to fibronectin and albumin was not considered significant (Fig.1 A). rα2I bound type I collagen in a Mg2+-dependent manner and the addition of 2 mm EDTA abolished binding completely (Fig. 1 B). This is consistent with the fact that α2β1 integrin interacts with collagen only in the presence of divalent cations (3Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The binding of rα2I domain to echovirus-1 was much weaker than to the matrix molecules. However, the binding was about 5-fold higher than to echovirus-7, a negative control virus known not to use α2β1 integrin as its cellular receptor (not shown). Furthermore, monoclonal antibody 12F1 could block rα2I domain binding to echovirus-1 but not to collagen (not shown), in agreement with the previous observation that matrix molecules and echovirus-1 recognize distinct motifs on the α2I domain (7Bergelson J.M. Chan B.M. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that jararhagin, a large hemorrhagic disintegrin/metalloproteinase from B. jararaca venom inhibits the interaction of platelet α2β1integrin with collagen (16De Luca M. Ward C.M. Ohmori K. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To investigate whether proteins found in the crude B. jararaca venom could interact directly with the rα2I domain, indicating a possible interaction between jararhagin and α2I domain, two solid-phase ligand binding assays were performed. First, europium-labeled rα2I domain was allowed to attach to collagen I substratum in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+, and the amount of bound rα2I was then determined. The effect of the venom was tested with concentrations ranging from 1 μg/ml to 1,000 μg/ml. The venom inhibited the rα2I domain-collagen interaction efficiently and in a concentration dependent manner (Fig.1 C). Second, we coated microtiter wells with the venom proteins and tested rα2I binding to this substratum. rα2I was found to bind the venom directly in a concentration-dependent manner (not shown). To study if the jararhagin sequence could be used to find a peptide that would interact with α2I domain, we used a series of short cyclic peptides corresponding to regions along the protein. The most obvious target was to design a peptide corresponding to the RGD-analogous region in the disintegrin-like domain.

https://openalex.org/W2139780190,"Stimulation of neurotransmitter release by α-latrotoxin requires its binding to the calcium-independent receptor of α-latrotoxin (CIRL), an orphan neuronal G protein-coupled receptor. CIRL consists of two noncovalently bound subunits, p85, a heptahelical integral membrane protein, and p120, a large extracellular polypeptide with domains homologous to lectin, olfactomedin, mucin, the secretin receptor family, and a novel structural motif common for large orphan G protein-coupled receptors. The analysis of CIRL deletion mutants indicates that the high affinity α-latrotoxin-binding site is located within residues 467–891, which comprise the first transmembrane segment of p85 and the C-terminal half of p120. The N-terminal lectin, olfactomedin, and mucin domains of p120 are not required for the interaction with α-latrotoxin. Soluble p120 and all its fragments, which include the 467–770 residues, bind α-latrotoxin with low affinity suggesting the importance of membrane-embedded p85 for the stabilization of the complex of the toxin with p120. Two COOH-terminal deletion mutants of CIRL, one with the truncated cytoplasmic domain and the other with only one transmembrane segment left of seven, supported both α-latrotoxin-induced calcium uptake in HEK293 cells and α-latrotoxin-stimulated secretion when expressed in chromaffin cells, although with a different dose dependence than wild-type CIRL and its N-terminal deletion mutant. Thus the signaling domains of CIRL are not critically important for the stimulation of exocytosis in intact chromaffin cells by α-latrotoxin.

Thus the signaling domains of CIRL are not critically important for the stimulation of exocytosis in intact chromaffin cells by α-latrotoxin. α-Latrotoxin, a potent natural stimulator of secretion from neurons and secretory cells, has two structurally and pharmacologically distinct classes of high affinity receptors (1Petrenko A.G. Krasnoperov V.G. Linial M. Grasso A. Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Toxin Action Secretory Systems. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 185-214Google Scholar). The calcium-dependent receptor of α-latrotoxin or neurexin Iα is a large (160–220 kDa) cell surface membrane protein existing in multiple isoforms (2Petrenko A.G. Kovalenko V.A. Shamotienko O.G.

A second high affinity receptor is the calcium-independentreceptor of α-latrotoxin (CIRL) 1The abbreviations used are: CIRL, calcium-independent receptor of α-latrotoxin; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GPS, GPCR proteolysis site; PSS, physiological salt solution; STP domain, Ser, Thr, and Pro-rich domain.

CIRL is thought to be more important for α-latrotoxin effects in neurons than neurexin Iα because α-latrotoxin can stimulate neurotransmitter release from neurons in Ca2+-free media (7Misler S.

CIRL, also called latrophilin, belongs to a family of closely related orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) homologous to the secretin receptor family (9Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21504-21508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In this family of three closely homologous proteins, CIRL-1 is a brain-enriched high affinity α-latrotoxin receptor, whereas CIRL-2 is a ubiquitously expressed low affinity receptor of the toxin (11Ichtchenko K. Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V. Little A.R. Chepurny O. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The CIRL receptors have an unusual structure for GPCRs. First, they are significantly larger (about 200 kDa) than most of the GPCRs. Second, they consist of two heterologous subunits because of endogenous proteolytic processing of the precursor protein. The site of this cleavage is located 18 residues upstream from the first transmembrane segment. As a result, mature CIRL consists of two noncovalently bound subunits, p120 and p85. p120 is a hydrophilic protein that is soluble and secreted if expressed separately from p85, whereas p85 has structural features typical of a generic GPCR although with an unusually large cytoplasmic tail (9Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G.

Grasso A. Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Toxin Action Secretory Systems. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 185-214Google Scholar, 12Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of signaling downstream of the receptors is not known. The heptahelical structure of CIRL suggests its function as a regulator of a G protein pathway. However, no coupling of CIRL to any G protein has been convincingly shown. Moreover, no direct data are currently available to prove that α-latrotoxin acts as an agonist or antagonist of its receptors. To analyze the structural requirements for α-latrotoxin binding and α-latrotoxin stimulatory function, we generated three series of CIRL deletion mutants. Soluble fragments of the extracellular region of CIRL were used to map the α-latrotoxin-binding site. On the basis of this information, N-terminally truncated membrane-bound forms of CIRL were produced, which were shown to retain high affinity α-latrotoxin binding activity. Finally, deletions in the COOH-terminal region of CIRL were produced to remove the domains potentially involved in receptor signaling. The constructs lacking the CIRL cytoplasmic tail and six of its seven transmembrane segments appeared to be fully functional in terms of α-latrotoxin binding, Ca2+ influx in HEK293 cells, and coupling of the toxin to secretion in transfected chromaffin cells. Our data suggest that G protein-mediated signaling is not critically important for the α-latrotoxin-stimulated secretion in chromaffin cells. α-Latrotoxin was purified from lyophilized black widow spider glands and radioactively labeled with 125I using the chloramine T procedure. The toxin was immobilized on BrCN-Sepharose as described (2Petrenko A.G. Kovalenko V.A. Shamotienko O.G. Surkova I.N. Tarasyuk T.A. Ushkaryov Y.A. Grishin E.V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2023-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The pCDR7N construct encoding the extracellular region of CIRL (residues 1–856) with COOH-terminal His6 tag was described previously (9Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V.

The pCDR120 construct encoding the p120 subunit of CIRL precisely was prepared by ligating theAgeI/XbaI-digested PCR product obtained with primers ACATCTAGAGGTGGCTGCAGGCACATGTGGTA and ACAGGCCCAGCCGGCCAACACCATCAAGCAGAACAGCC on the 87-7 CIRL cDNA clone as a template into pCDR7 plasmid cut with AgeI/XbaI. The structure of the PCR-derived region of the final plasmid was verified by sequencing. The recombinant DNA fragments encoding other deletion mutants were prepared by high fidelity PCR with Pfu polymerase and synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing SfiI (sense) orXbaI (antisense) restriction sites. The expression constructs were prepared by ligating theSfiI/XbaI-digested PCR products intoSfiI/XbaI-digested pSecTag plasmid (Invitrogen) in frame with the His6 tag. Thus prepared constructs encoded the following residues of CIRL: pSTR7-1, residues 25–598; pSTR7-2, residues 25–856; pSTR7-3, residues 25–631; pSTR7-4, residues 25–705; pSTR7-5, residues 25–770; pSTR7-6, residues 128–856; pSTR7–9, residues 538–856; pSTR7-16, residues 467–705; pSTR7-20, residues 185–856. The plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells using the LipofectAMINE method according to Life Technologies, Inc. protocol. After 3 days, the conditioned media and cells were harvested and analyzed for the presence of the recombinant protein by precipitation with nickel-agarose followed by Western blotting with anti-p120 antibody. To generate the N-terminal deletion mutants anchored to the membrane-bound fragment of CIRL, AgeI/XbaI-digested pSTR7-6, -7, -8, and -9 plasmids were ligated with a DNA fragment of 3,060 base pairs obtained by digesting pCDR7 with AgeI/XbaI. This insert encoded a short COOH-terminal region of p120 and the entire p85 subunit. These constructs encoded the following residues of CIRL: pSTR7-6M, residues 128–1471; pSTR7-7M, residues 394–1471; pSTR7-8M, residues 467–1471; pSTR7-9M, residues 538–1471. COS cells were transfected with these plasmids, harvested in 3 days, and analyzed for α-latrotoxin binding activity as described below. COS cells were transfected with an expression plasmid pCDR7N encoding the entire N-terminal extracellular region of CIRL (1–837 residues) with a His6 tag at the COOH terminus. In 2 days, the cell media were collected, and 10 ml of media were incubated with 300 μl of nickel-agarose overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The matrix was washed 4 times with 50 mm Tris-HCl and 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and eluted with 1 ml of 100 mmimidazole in the same buffer. The binding activity of the eluted proteins was measured by a solid-phase method on a 96-well plate (5Krasnoperov V.G. Beavis R. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Petrenko A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).125I-α-Latrotoxin was added to a final concentration of 0.5–60 nm. Specific binding was measured as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding in the presence of 900 nm unlabeled α-latrotoxin. Two COOH-terminal deletion mutants of CIRL were prepared. The first one, pCDR-7TMR, included the p120 subunit, the seven transmembrane region, and 49 N-terminal amino acid residues of the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail (residues 1–1149 of CIRL). The second one, pCDR-1TMR, included p120, the first transmembrane region, and the first intracellular loop of p85 (residues 1–891). To generate a pCDR-7TMR expression vector, two complementary 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides, 5′-pCCGGAGCGGCCGCTGAT and 5′-pCTAGATCAGCGGCCGCT, were used in the ligation reaction with theBspEI/XbaI-digested pCDR7 (9Krasnoperov V.G.

To generate a pCDR-1TMR expression vector, the 7313-base pair product ofAgeI/XbaI digestion of pCDR7 was ligated with a 421-base pair fragment obtained by AgeI/XbaI digestion of a 1267-base pair PCR product where pCDR7 was used as a template and the primers ACAGGCCCAGCCGGCCAATCTGCATGTGTCCCCTGAGCT and TTTCTAGATCAGCGGTCGGTCTGCAG were used. 0.7 ml of media from transfected COS cells was cleared by centrifugation and incubated with 15 μl of α-latrotoxin-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The matrices were washed 3 times with 1.25 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, and eluted with SDS electrophoresis sample buffer. The eluates were electrophoresed and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p120 antibody. Three days after transfection, the COS cells were harvested on ice in physiological saline and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in a 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0, incubation buffer, and 10% of the cell material harvested from one 100-mm Petri dish was incubated with 5 nm125I-α-latrotoxin in the final volume of 200 μl for 15 min. The binding reaction suspensions were diluted with the ice-cold incubation buffer and immediately centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in the Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min. The pellets were counted for radioactivity in a γ-counter. The nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 100 nm cold toxin. Chromaffin cell and HEK293 cell transfections and functional analysis of CIRL mutants were performed as described previously (9Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V.

Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Computer-assisted analysis of the CIRL protein sequence reveals a number of distinct structural domains (Fig. 1). A central region of CIRL (residues 850–1100) shows significant homology to the members of the secretin family of GPCRs (9Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). According to the hydrophobicity plot of CIRL, this region contains seven long hydrophobic stretches, a hallmark of GPCRs. In GPCRs, these hydrophobic sequences are α-helical rods that form a compact oval-shaped integral transmembrane cluster (15Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Similar to other GPCRs, three intracellular and three extracellular hydrophilic loops in between transmembrane helices can be identified in CIRL. The intracellular COOH-terminal region of CIRL (residues 1100–1471) is unusually large for an average GPCR. It contains a pair of vicinal Cys residues typical for the GPCR palmitoylation site and several proline reach clusters. It has no significant homology to any known protein except for two other members of the CIRL family, CIRL-2 and -3 (11Ichtchenko K. Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V. Little A.R. Chepurny O. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, several domains of the extracellular N-terminal region of CIRL show significant homology with various receptor and nonreceptor proteins. The signal peptide sequence is followed by a cysteine-rich domain (residues 30–120) homologous to sea urchin eggd-galactoside-specific lectin (GenBank number P22031) and plant β-galactosidase (GenBank number Z99708). The same domain is found in a Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of CIRL (GenBank number Z54306). The adjacent domain (residues 120–400) is similar to olfactomedin (GenBank number AF028740), a major structural block in the extracellular matrix of the olfactory neuroepithelium and several structurally related proteins including the pancortin family (GenBank number Q62609, D78264, D78262, Q99784, AB006688, AF049796, AF035301,Q99972, AF039869). Their physiological role is unclear. The next structural domain (residues 400–470) is enriched in Ser, Thr, and Pro residues and shows insignificant homology to mucin and other Pro-rich proteins. We will therefore refer to this domain as the STP domain. The STP domain is followed by a short region (residues 470–540) with a Cys-rich motif CX 9–10WX 9–12CX 10–17CX 4–6WX 8–16C identified by Ψ-Blast search in the extracellular domains of GPCRs, which belong to the secretin receptor family. Interestingly, in “normal” receptors of this family (e.g. vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor, secretin receptor, calcitonin receptor, corticotropin-releasing factor receptor, growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor, glucagon-like peptide receptor, etc.) this motif is located very close to the transmembrane core. In the CIRL family and in a number of other large orphan GPCRs (GenBank numbers U39848, Z54306,D87469, AB011529, AB011528, AB005297, AB011536, AB011122), this motif is located several hundred amino acid residues from the membrane segments, and therefore we may assume that the large orphan receptors represent a separate subfamily within the family of the secretin receptor. The region between residues 541 and 800 has low homology to brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-3 (GenBank number AB005299), another large orphan GPCR that among all known large GPCRs is most similar to the members of the CIRL family. The recently discovered brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor family was implicated in tumor angiogenesis regulation; brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 expression is regulated by p53 (16Nishimori H.

Nishimori H. Ichise H. Nakamura Y. Tokino T. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 79: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Finally, in the COOH terminus of p120 immediately adjacent to the putative site of CIRL proteolysis a novel structural motif is found that is characteristic for about a dozen large orphan GPCRs of the secretin receptor family (GenBank numbers U39848, U76764, P48960,Q61549, Q14246, AC004262, D87469, AB011529, AB011528, AB011536,AB005297, X81892, AB005298, AF006014, AB011122). We propose to name this motif GPS for GPCR proteolysis site. The characteristic feature of the GPS domain is a cysteine signature including CXC, two additional cysteine residues, and two tryptophan residues at fixed positions. When conserved residues of the GPS motif were mutated, CIRL could no longer be proteolyzed endogenously. 2V. Krasnoperov, K. Ichtchenko, and A. G. Petrenko, manuscript in preparation. We showed earlier that the recombinant N-terminal extracellular region of CIRL binds efficiently to immobilized α-latrotoxin (9Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To identify the α-latrotoxin binding domain(s) of CIRL more precisely, we have generated a series of deletion mutants of its extracellular region. The desired DNA fragments were prepared by high fidelity PCR with synthetic oligonucleotide primers that were designed according to the putative domain borders of the extracellular region of CIRL (Fig.2). The PCR fragments were cloned into a pSecTag eucaryotic expression plasmid (Invitrogen), which contained a signal peptide sequence that allowed extracellular secretion of soluble proteins and a COOH-terminally fused His6 tag that allowed easy purification of the recombinant protein. The resulting constructs were transfected into COS cells. The cells and media were harvested and analyzed for the presence of recombinant proteins by the adsorption onto nickel-agarose followed by Western blotting with anti-p120 antibody. Among tested constructs, pCDR-120, pCDR7N, and pSTR7-2, -6, -7, and -20 were expressed and secreted in the medium. Proteins encoded by pSTR7-1, -3, -4, -5, -9, and -16 were expressed well but accumulated inside the cells (data not shown). It is interesting to note that most of the secreted proteins were N-terminally truncated, whereas most of the nonsecreted deletion mutants were COOH-terminally truncated. This finding raises a possibility that the extracellular region of CIRL contains in its COOH-terminal part a signal sequence that regulates intracellular sorting and trafficking of the protein. To analyze the α-latrotoxin binding activity of the recombinant proteins, the conditioned media or cell extracts were adsorbed onto α-latrotoxin-Sepharose followed by Western blotting with anti-p120 antibody (Fig. 3). The constructs pCDR-120, pCDR7N, and pSTR7-2, -5, -6, -7, and -20 specifically interacted with the toxin, whereas pSTR7-1, -3, -4, -9, and -16 did not. The shortest N-terminally truncated mutant that still bound the toxin was pSTR7-7. A shorter construct pSTR7-9 (residues 538–856) failed to interact with the toxin. The analysis of α-latrotoxin binding activity of COOH-terminally truncated mutants demonstrated that the downstream border of the toxin-binding site may be located close to the membrane. The pCDR7N protein, which is the entire extracellular region of CIRL (residues 1–856) and recombinant p120 (residues 1–837, construct pCDR-120), bound to the toxin quite well. A shorter protein pSTR7-5 (residues 25–770) bound to α-latrotoxin much less efficiently, whereas pSTR7-4 (residues 25–705) did not interact with the toxin at all. Together, these data suggest that the residues critical for α-latrotoxin binding are located in the COOH-terminal half of p120 with a significant site of interaction around residue 770. To further analyze the interaction of α-latrotoxin with the extracellular domain of CIRL and its fragments, we tested the ability of these soluble proteins to inhibit the binding of iodinated α-latrotoxin to brain membranes. Surprisingly, no significant inhibition was detected with any protein tested including the entire uncleaved extracellular domain encoded by pCDR7N, p120 (these two constructs were not based on PCR-generated sequences), and their fragments (data not shown). The concentration of CIRL fragments in the binding mixtures was typically in the range of 20–60 nm, whereas the concentration of labeled α-latrotoxin was 2 nm. Because these same soluble CIRL fragments bound quite well to immobilized α-latrotoxin, we assumed that they were α-latrotoxin-binding proteins. However, their affinity to the toxin was lower than the affinity of endogenous CIRL, and therefore they could not compete effectively in the concentration range tested. To estimate the affinity of p120 and its deletion mutants to α-latrotoxin, we used the solid-phase assay developed earlier for the analysis of α-latrotoxin binding activity of detergent-solubilized CIRL (5Krasnoperov V.G.

Commun. 1996; 227: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). p120 solution was applied to the bottoms of 96-well plates by drying at ambient temperature. After washing and blocking, solutions with various concentrations of 125I-α-latrotoxin were added to the wells. Following multiple washes, the absorbed labeled toxin was eluted with SDS-containing buffer and counted for radioactivity. Scatchard plot analysis revealed that the affinity of α-latrotoxin binding to p120 was about 25 nm, which was approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than the affinity of CIRL binding (data not shown). Low affinity interaction of α-latrotoxin with soluble p120 raised the possibility that the formation of high affinity complex requires participation of p85. To test this, we recombined DNA fragments encoding soluble deletion mutants with the sequence of p85 so that the resulting constructs encoded N-terminally truncated forms of CIRL. In the 5′-region of pSTR7-6, -7, -8, and -9, a fragment of CIRL cDNA was subcloned, which restored the junction of p120 and p85 identically to wild-type CIRL. The resulting expression constructs encoded the following residues of the CIRL protein sequence: pSTR7-6M, residues 128–1471; pSTR7-7M, 394–1471; pSTR7-8M, 467–1471; pSTR7-9M, 538–1471. The analysis of the transfected COS cells demonstrated that all mutants except pSTR7-9M bound to α-latrotoxin specifically (Fig.4 A). This result was in good agreement with the analysis of soluble deletion mutants of CIRL and suggests that lectin-like, olfactomedin-like, and STP (mucin-like) domains in the N-terminal half of p120 are not important for α-latrotoxin binding. We further quantitated the α-latrotoxin binding activity of pSTR7-7M and pSTR7-8M, the two shortest α-latrotoxin-binding mutants, by Scatchard plot analysis. It appeared that both membrane-bound deletion mutants interacted with α-latrotoxin with the same high affinity as wild-type CIRL (Fig. 4, B and C). We can therefore conclude that the primary α-latrotoxin-binding site is located in the COOH-terminal half of p120. However, the high affinity interaction requires complexing of p120 with membrane-bound p85. Because the plasmids for membrane-bound mutants were prepared on the basis of the constructs encoding soluble CIRL fragments, this experiment also demonstrates that the low affinity of the recombinant soluble CIRL fragments was not because of a PCR or cloning artifact. To test the importance of different regions of p85 in the interaction with α-latrotoxin, we generated two mutants of CIRL with deleted portions of the p85 subunit by introducing stop codons (Fig.5). The first mutant pCDR-7TMR did not contain most of the large COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of p85. In the second mutant pCDR-1TMR, the N-terminal region of p85 with only one transmembrane segment was preserved. It appeared that both deletion mutants expressed very well and both showed α-latrotoxin binding activity (Fig. 6 A). The Scatchard plot analysis of the one transmembrane mutant demonstrated high affinity binding indistinguishable from the wild-type receptor (Fig. 6 B). These results rule out the involvement of the extracellular loops and the cytoplasmic tail of p85 in the stabilization of the α-latrotoxin complex with p120.Figure 6High affinity interaction of α-latrotoxin with COOH-terminal deletion mutants of CIRL. A, COS cells transfected with pCDR7 (wild-type CIRL or WT), salmon sperm DNA (SS) as a negative control, pCDR-7TMR, and pCDR-1TMR on day 3 were harvested and incubated with 5 nm125I-α-latrotoxin. The total binding of the labeled toxin is shown as black bars. The nonspecific binding measured in the presence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled toxin is shown as gray bars. Each experiment was done in duplicate and the average is shown (deviation was less than 3% for each measurement shown). B, the α-latrotoxin binding affinity of the deletion mutant pCDR-1TMR was compared with the affinity of CIRL by Scatchard plot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We determined whether deletion constructs that possessed high affinity α-latrotoxin binding (pCDR-1TMR, pCDR-7TMR, and pCDR7-8) supported α-latrotoxin-stimulated calcium influx when expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 7). All three proteins increased the uptake of 45Ca2+, although the pCDR-1TMR mutant was less effective than pCDR-7TMR, pCDR7-8, or CIRL itself and had little effect at 50 pmα-latrotoxin. The data indicate that the COOH-terminal part of CIRL is not required in mediating the effects of α-latrotoxin on calcium permeability and suggest that high affinity α-latrotoxin binding is sufficient for calcium influx. We noted that at higher concentrations of α-latrotoxin cells transfected with a control plasmid (neo) or nontransfected cells (not shown) also exhibited some α-latrotoxin-stimulated45Ca2+ influx. This increase in calcium permeability is probably because of the α-latrotoxin interaction with an endogenous HEK293 cell protein, because it is completely blocked by preincubation of the cells with concanavalin A (data not shown). Transient expression of CIRL in chromaffin cells increases their sensitivity to α-latrotoxin (9Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We asked whether the increase in calcium permeability seen with pCDR-1TMR, pCDR-7TMR, and pCDR7-8 was coupled to the secretory response in chromaffin cells. Because the transfection efficiency of primary cultures is low, the various mutants were co-expressed with human growth hormone, which is stored in secretory granules and serves as a reporter for secretion from the transfected cells. Each of the three constructs increased the sensitivity of transfected cells to low concentrations of α-latrotoxin (2.5 and 10 pm), and the magnitude of the effect was similar to that of wild-type CIRL (Fig.8 A). Catecholamine release (a measure of secretion from all the cells, the majority of which were not successfully transfected) was similar for all the groups (Fig.8 B). We conclude that the COOH-terminal part of CIRL is unnecessary in mediating α-latrotoxin-stimulated secretion from intact chromaffin cells. Interestingly, at higher concentrations of α-latrotoxin, some inactivation of the secretory response was seen with CIRL and pCDR7-8 that did not occur with the COOH-terminal deletion mutants 1TMR and 7TMR, raising the possibility that the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CIRL plays an additional role in modulating secretion. α-Latrotoxin acts extracellularly by binding to endogenous membrane receptors that belong to the neurexin and CIRL families. The formation of receptor-toxin complexes is followed by cation influx through α-latrotoxin-induced channels and by as yet unidentified signaling that eventually results in massive spontaneous exocytosis. Part of the effects of α-latrotoxin can be explained by Ca2+ entry through the toxin-induced pores. However, the toxin is also active when applied in nominally Ca2+-free buffers (7Misler S.

Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 917-923PubMed Google Scholar) or when cation fluxes are controlled,e.g. in permeabilized cells (14Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lang J. Ushkaryov Y. Grasso A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A possible explanation of the calcium-independent effect of α-latrotoxin is that it activates its membrane receptors, which results in intracellular signaling, through a G protein-linked pathway (19Lang J. Ushkaryov Y. Grasso A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Davletov B.A. Meunier F.A. Ashton A.C. Matsushita H. Hirst W.D. Lelianova V.G. Wilkin G.P. Dolly J.O. Ushkaryov Y.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3909-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To analyze the interaction of α-latrotoxin with CIRL and subsequent functional effects, we have generated a set of CIRL deletion mutants that were examined in binding experiments,45Ca2+ influx assays in HEK293 cells and secretion experiments in chromaffin cells. We found that 1) small segments of the extracellular and membrane domains of CIRL are required for high affinity binding to latrotoxin and for functional effects of latrotoxin, and 2) CIRL-coupled G protein signaling is not critically important for α-latrotoxin-stimulated Ca2+ influx in HEK293 cells or secretion from chromaffin cells. The evidence in support of these conclusions is discussed below. CIRL consists of two noncovalently bound subunits, p120, which is extracellular, and p85, which contains seven transmembrane segments and the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The analysis of a series of soluble recombinant fragments of CIRL by precipitation with α-latrotoxin-agarose showed that the α-latrotoxin-binding site lies within the COOH-terminal half of p120. However, none of the recombinant soluble fragments of CIRL (including p120 and the nonprocessed full-size extracellular region, pCDR7N) that bound effectively to immobilized α-latrotoxin were able to compete with the binding of α-latrotoxin to endogenous CIRL in brain membranes. The Scatchard plot analysis of the α-latrotoxin binding activity of the full-length extracellular region indicated that its affinity was about 2 orders of magnitude lower than the affinity of CIRL. In contrast, two N-terminally truncated fragments of CIRL, which contained p85 in addition to the α-latrotoxin binding domain of p120, bound the toxin with the same high affinity as wild-type CIRL. The extracellular loops of p85 are apparently not important for the stabilization of the complex with the toxin because a deletion mutant, which contained only the first transmembrane segment, bound to α-latrotoxin with high affinity. Therefore we propose that the interaction of α-latrotoxin with CIRL consists of two sequential steps. At first, α-latrotoxin binds with medium affinity to the extracellular region of CIRL. Following this binding, the toxin interacts with the first transmembrane segment of CIRL, with the membrane lipids, or with both and penetrates into the lipid bilayer as a result. This second step increases affinity of the interaction and may require a longer time, which would explain a known delay in α-latrotoxin effects within a minute after its application. CIRL deletion mutants that bound α-latrotoxin with high affinity were also effective in coupling α-latrotoxin to calcium influx into HEK293 cells and exocytosis in chromaffin cells, although the 1TMR mutant was noticeably less effective than wild-type CIRL and other mutants in the45Ca2+ uptake assay. Most importantly, a mutant receptor lacking six of seven transmembrane segments was similar to wild-type CIRL in the secretion experiments. Because this mutant receptor would be unable to activate G proteins, these experiments indicate that the receptor does not mediate the stimulatory effect of α-latrotoxin in intact chromaffin cells by direct coupling to G proteins. The shape of the dose-effect curves for overexpressed wild-type CIRL and its N-terminally truncated mutant was significantly different from those of the COOH-terminal mutants (Fig. 8 A). The dose dependence of the α-latrotoxin-stimulated exocytosis in chromaffin cells via either endogenous receptors, overexpressed CIRL, or its N-terminal mutant was bell-shaped (14Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). In contrast, for both COOH-terminally truncated mutants, the dose dependence did not show “inactivation” at higher concentrations of α-latrotoxin. It is therefore possible that α-latrotoxin binding to CIRL results in multiple effects, one of which is dependent upon the integrity of the COOH terminus of the p85 subunit. What may be the physiological importance of CIRL? Because it serves to target α-latrotoxin, a potent stimulator of secretion, it is likely that this receptor is positioned appropriately for the regulation of exocytosis. CIRL has been shown to co-purify with syntaxin, a t-SNARE (9Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In permeabilized chromaffin cells overexpression of CIRL inhibits Ca2+-stimulated secretion (14Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that CIRL may serve as a physiological regulator of exocytosis. Because of the presence of cell adhesion structural modules in its extracellular domain, it is possible that direct physical contacts of cells modulate secretion via CIRL-mediated signaling."

We find that LPA causes a marked activation of NF-κB in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts as determined by the degradation of IκB-α in the cytosol and the emergence of κB binding activity in nuclear extracts. The EC50 for activation of NF-κB is 1–5 μm, a range similar to that reported for reinitiation of DNA synthesis and activation of the serum response element.

The combination of phorbol ester and thapsigargin promotes an activation comparable with that of LPA. Activation by LPA is additionally inhibited by tyrphostin A25 but not genistein or AG1478, indicating a selective utilization of protein-tyrosine kinases, and by certain antioxidants, implying a role for reactive oxygen species. The activation is also inhibited by tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609), implying a requirement for hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine.

Synthesized and released by platelets, LPA represents a major bioactive constituent of serum, and its actions on fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in particular suggest roles in wound healing among other events. Indeed, LPA acts on a large number of cells to achieve a broad range of immediate and long lasting effects. Specific responses to LPA include changes in cell shape and tension, chemotaxis, proliferation, and differentiation. The molecular actions of LPA have been characterized best in rodent fibroblasts, where at low concentrations (i.e. 10–100 nm) LPA stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis (3Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12232-12239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and promotes the Rho-dependent formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions (4Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3806) Google Scholar). The stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis is thought to occur through the GTP-binding regulatory protein (G protein) Gq. The formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions is consistent with activation of Rho through G12 or G13 (5Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). One or a combination of these G proteins is also responsible for the protein tyrosine phosphorylation elicited by LPA (6Kumagai N. Morii N. Fujisawa K. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hordijk P.L Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

LPA additionally inhibits adenylyl cyclase, an action achieved through the pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G protein Gi(9van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eicholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). LPA uses Gi, moreover, to activate Ras, Raf, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) ERK1 and ERK2 (10van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 11Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of ERKs (11Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and presumably the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (3Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12232-12239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), occurs at concentrations of LPA comparable with those stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis and cytoskeletal changes. At higher concentrations (i.e. 5–70 μm), LPA promotes reinitiation of DNA synthesis in quiescent fibroblasts (9van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eicholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Whether G proteins are sufficient for this action is unclear, but the sensitivity of the phenomenon to PTX implies that Girepresents at least one necessary input. The need for high concentrations of LPA in this context may relate to a requirement for more persistent signaling and/or engagement of other receptors or pathways. Micromolar concentrations of LPA also promote arachidonic acid formation, a second phase of inositol phosphate accumulation (PTX-insensitive), and activation of serum response factor (9van Corven E.J.

Receptors that recognize LPA are poorly characterized; however, several have been identified that conform to the seven-transmembrane domain motif characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (14Hecht J.H.

NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) is the prototype of a family of dimers whose constituents are members of the Rel family of transcription factors (18Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). In most types of cells, NF-κB is present as a heterodimer comprising p50 (NF-κB1) and p65 (RelA). NF-κB is normally retained in the cytosol in an inactive form through interaction with IκB inhibitory proteins. Release of NF-κB for translocation to the nucleus and interaction with cognate DNA sequences is accomplished through a signal-induced phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB. Originally described as a necessary element for expression of the immunoglobulin κ gene in mature B cells, NF-κB is now recognized to be an important transcriptional regulatory protein in a variety of cell types (19Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). The binding of agonists to certain GPCRs promotes activation of NF-κB. Agonists include serotonin (working through the 5-HT1A receptor) (20Cowen D.S. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), platelet-activating factor (21Kravchenko V.V. Pan Z. Han J. Herbert J.-M. Ulevitch R.J. Ye R.D. J. Biol.

That GPCRs are linked to NF-κB is particularly significant, since these receptors are widely distributed, the actions of NF-κB are notable, and the coincident activation of NF-κB and other GPCR-regulated transcription factors can provide unique forms of transcriptional regulation. Because LPA exerts a wide range of actions in part or entirely through GPCRs, and because NF-κB is especially relevant to inflammation and wound healing, we instituted efforts here to understand whether LPA promotes the activation of NF-κB. We explored the possible relationship between LPA and NF-κB in fibroblasts and the mechanisms by which this relationship is established. l-α-Lysophosphatidic acid (C18:1,[cis]-9), cycloheximide, ascorbic acid, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, and dimethyl sulfoxide were obtained from Sigma.

For all experiments, 1 × 106 cells were subcultured into 10-cm tissue culture plates (Nunc).

The supernatant was removed, and the nuclei were resuspended in hypertonic buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and shaken for 45 min at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 30 s, and the supernatants (nuclear extracts) were saved. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus κB binding site (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; the underlined sequence represents the consensus κB region), which was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts (2.5 μg of protein) were incubated in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.15 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 20–30 fmol of32P-labeled oligonucleotide (50,000–100,000 cpm) in a total volume of 15 μl at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction mixture was then subjected to electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide slab gel containing 50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8. The gels were dried under vacuum for analysis by autoradiography (overnight exposure) or PhosphorImager analysis. For competition studies, nuclear extracts were incubated prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide for 10 min at room temperature with unlabeled oligonucleotide, unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a G → C substitution in the κB binding motif (5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′), or an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus binding site for Sp1 (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′). For supershift analysis, nuclear extracts were incubated with approximately 2 μg of antibodies specific for p65 (RelA) or nonimmune goat IgG for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of radiolabeled oligonucleotide prior to electrophoresis. The results shown in all figures are representative of at least three experiments. Following exposure to LPA with or without cycloheximide as specified, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 100 mmNa3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (11% acrylamide). Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-human IκB-α (0.4 mg/ml) detected subsequently by chemiluminescence using a donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and luminol as recommended by the manufacturer (ECL Western; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The possibility that LPA activates the transcription factor NF-κB was investigated in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, which have been used extensively in studies of agonists, including LPA, linked to changes in cell morphology and reinitiation of DNA synthesis (4Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3806) Google Scholar, 25Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 26Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We examined first the extent to which LPA promotes degradation of IκB-α, an inhibitory protein whose proteolysis would precede the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. As shown in Fig.1 (left panel), LPA caused a transient degradation of this protein. Levels of IκB-α decreased slowly following introduction of LPA, reaching a minimum at 40–60 min, and increased thereafter to near control values. The time-dependent resynthesis of IκB-α is a common finding in cytokine action (27Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Sieberlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2532-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and appears to reflect activation of the IκB-α gene by NF-κB as part of a feedback loop (28Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). To circumvent resynthesis of IκB-α, we also evaluated degradation of this protein in the presence of cycloheximide. As expected, degradation of IκB-α under this condition, where protein synthesis is blocked, was complete. A more direct evaluation of NF-κB activation was carried out by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The data in Fig.2 demonstrate that LPA promotes a time- and concentration-dependent appearance of a factor(s) within nuclear extracts that binds to an oligonucleotide probe containing an NF-κB binding site. The proinflammatory cytokine TNFα also promotes the appearance of this factor. The relevant protein-DNA complex was evident as a band of radioactivity (denoted by anarrow) positioned above two less prominent bands. This band, but not the other two, was supershifted with a p65 (RelA)-directed antibody (Fig. 3, top panel), confirming the identity of the induced factor as NF-κB. The nature of the protein-DNA interaction was evaluated further in competition experiments (Fig. 3, bottom panel), where the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was found to be displaced by unlabeled oligonucleotide. The same unlabeled oligonucleotide, but containing a mutation in the κB site, and an altogether unrelated oligonucleotide (containing an Sp1 binding site) did not displace the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. The EC50 for LPA based on the intensity of the shifted band was 1–5 μm, and the time required for full development of the response was 40–60 min (Fig. 2). The response was transient, as the level of shifted oligonucleotide began to decrease by 3 h (not shown).Figure 3Identity and specificity of κB binding activity. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated with 40 μm LPA (or vehicle) or 30 ng/ml TNFα for 40 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared for electrophoretic mobility shift assays.

The LPA-induced complex of32P-labeled oligonucleotide and NF-κB is designated by the arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extent to which the G protein Gi might contribute to the activation of NF-κB was assessed with PTX, which suppresses activation of Gi by GPCRs. Pretreatment of cells with PTX attenuated LPA-induced activation of NF-κB by approximately 60% (Fig. 4, top panel). Efforts to enhance the attenuation by manipulating pretreatment time and concentration of PTX were unsuccessful. That the actions of LPA typically assigned to Gi are not completely suppressed by PTX, for example ERK activation and reinitiation of DNA synthesis, is not without precedent (9van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eicholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 10van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A downstream target for both Gi and Gq is the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-β, whose activation results in recruitment of PKC and mobilization of Ca2+. Overnight treatment of cells with a high concentration of PMA (1 μm) to induce down-regulation of classical and novel forms of PKC suppressed activation of NF-κB by 70–80% (not shown), as did Ro-31-8220 (Fig. 4, middle panel), which inhibits all forms of PKC. Other inhibitors of PKC, including bisindolylmaleimide I (not shown) and calphostin C, inhibited activation of NF-κB nearly as well. Activation of NF-κB was completely suppressed by pretreatment of cells with the cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (Fig. 4, bottom panel). Given the apparent requirements for PKC and intracellular Ca2+, we tested whether the activation of PKC and/or mobilization of Ca2+ might be sufficient to activate NF-κB. Some degree of activation was achieved with PMA, but not the extent observed with LPA (Fig. 5). Only a small degree of activation was achieved with thapsigargin, moreover, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase that causes a time-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+. However, the combination of thapsigargin and PMA activated NF-κB ultimately to an extent somewhat greater than that achieved with LPA. Because considerable attention has been devoted to the utilization of the EGF receptor and other tyrosine kinases by GPCRs, including the one or more receptors that mediate the actions of LPA (29Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 30Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), we tested inhibitors of different tyrosine kinases for their effect on LPA-induced activation of NF-κB. Genistein, which inhibits a wide range of tyrosine kinases, was without effect (Fig.6). Tyrphostin AG1478, a relatively specific inhibitor of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, caused some degree of inhibition but only at very high concentrations (16 μm is shown; concentrations normally used to inhibit the EGF receptor are 0.125–1 μm (29Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 31Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar)). At concentrations less than 5 μm, AG1478 had no effect. In contrast, tyrphostin A25, like genistein regarded as a general inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, achieved a significant degree of inhibition at 25 and 50 μm and complete inhibition by 150 μm(not shown; 150 μm is a commonly employed concentration (31Gohla A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) demonstrated that LPA stimulates reactive oxygen species production in HeLa cells and that antioxidants inhibit LPA-stimulated MAP kinase kinase activity. We therefore evaluated the effects of antioxidants on the activation of NF-κB. As shown in Fig.7, N-acetylcysteine completely inhibited LPA-induced activation of NF-κB. Pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate was similarly effective. Dimethyl sulfoxide achieved a less extensive, but still notable, inhibition. Ascorbic acid and dithiothreitol were without effect. The activation of NF-κB was also highly sensitive to diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of flavanoid-containing enzymes such as NADPH oxidase. The tricyclodecan xanthogenate D609 inhibits the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine at the level of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C-like enzyme and/or phospholipase D (34Cai H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28829-28832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this compound inhibits Na+/H+ exchange stimulated by α12. We found here that D609 inhibits quite effectively the activation of NF-κB by LPA (Fig.8). The EC50 was about 3 μg/ml, and the maximum degree of inhibition was greater than 90%. Potassium ethylxanthate had no effect. D609 was not nearly as potent an inhibitor of TNFα's activation of NF-κB as it was of LPA's. Inhibition in the case of TNFα occurred only at concentrations of D609 exceeding 50 μg/ml. The activation of NF-κB by LPA was thus selectively inhibited by D609. That proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and TNFα activate NF-κB has long been appreciated, and the sequence of events by which the activation occurs is now emerging (39Régnier C.H.

Of perhaps equal significance, however, is the fact that agonists working through GPCRs can also activate NF-κB (20Cowen D.S. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. Mol.

LPA has a rich and important biology; it induces a number of cells to proliferate and others to differentiate and, at a molecular level, works through one or more G proteins to stimulate MAP kinases, phospholipid metabolism, and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Activation of NF-κB clearly constitutes an additional action of LPA, and one to be reconciled in any setting of transcription relevant to this agonist. LPA triggers a pronounced activation of NF-κB, as ascertained by the degradation of IκB-α and the emergence of κB binding activity in nuclear extracts.

First, we replaced eight unique A1AR residues with amino acids present at corresponding transmembrane (TM) positions of A2AARs. We also tested the role of carboxamide amino acids in TMs 1–4, and the roles of Val-87, Leu-88, and Thr-91 in TM3. Following conversion of Gly-14 in TM1 to Thr-14, the affinity for adenosine agonists increased 100-fold, and after Pro-25 in TM1 was converted to Leu-25, the affinity for agonists fell. After conversion of TM3 sites Thr-91 to Ala-91, and Gln-92 to Ala-92, the affinity forN6-substituted agonists was reduced, and binding of ligands without N6 substituents was eliminated. When Leu-88 was converted to Ala-88, the binding of ligands with N6 substituents was reduced to a greater extent than ligands without N6 substituents. Following conversion of Pro-86 to Phe-86, the affinity forN6-substituted agonists was lost, and the affinity for ligands without N6 substitution was reduced. These observations strongly suggest that Thr-91 and Gln-92 in TM3 interact with the adenosine adenine moiety, and Leu-88 and Pro-86 play roles in conferring specificity for A1AR selective compounds. Using computer modeling based on the structure of rhodopsin, a revised model of adenosine-A1AR interactions is proposed with the N6-adenine position oriented toward the top of TM3 and the ribose group interacting with the bottom half of TMs 3 and 7.

Because activation of A1ARs has considerable therapeutic importance in treating clinical conditions (1Shryock J.C. Belardinelli L. Am. J.

Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), there is considerable interest in deciphering how adenosine interacts with A1ARs. A1ARs are G protein-coupled receptors that have seven transmembrane (TM) spanning domains (Fig.1) (1Shryock J.C. Belardinelli L. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 79: 2-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 2Brundege J.M. Dunwiddie T.V. Adv.

Initial structure-function studies of A1ARs focused on amino acids within TMs 5–7 (4Olah M.E. Ren H. Ostrowski J. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10764-10770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His-256 in TM6 was identified as a site that interacts with antagonists (4Olah M.E. Ren H. Ostrowski J. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10764-10770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within TM7, the amino acid at position 270 was found to account for species-related differences in affinity for A1-selective drugs (5Tucker A.L. Robeva A.S. Taylor H.E. Holeton D. Bockner M. Lynch K.R. Linden J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27900-27906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid at position 277 was shown to interact with the 5′ position of the adenosine ribose moiety (6Townsend-Nicholson A. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2373-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also suggested that His-278 in TM7 is important for ligand binding (4Olah M.E. Ren H. Ostrowski J. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10764-10770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, studies of chimeric A1/A2AARs have shown that TMs 1–4 of A1ARs contain the sites that confer the ligand binding characteristics of an A1AR (7Rivkees S.A. Lasbury M.E. Barbhaiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20485-20490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because modification of the N6 adenine position confers A1AR selectivity of adenosinergic compounds (8Tivedi B.K. Bridges A.J. Bruns R.F. Williams M. Adenosine and Adenosine Receptors. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1990: 57-103Crossref Google Scholar), this observation strongly suggests that theN6-adenine position interacts with sites within TMs 1–4 (7Rivkees S.A. Lasbury M.E. Barbhaiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20485-20490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Within the first four TM domains of the A1AR, mutation of Glu-16 in TM1 results in broad decreases in agonist affinity, and mutation of Ser-94 in TM3 results in a complete loss in ligand binding (7Rivkees S.A. Lasbury M.E. Barbhaiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20485-20490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Yet, despite these observations, a clear understanding of how adenosine interacts with A1ARs is not at hand. To provide additional insights into how ligands interact with A1ARs, we have tested the potential roles of several amino acids in TMs 1–4 in ligand binding. First, we have replaced amino acids within TMs 1–4 of A1ARs with amino acids present at corresponding positions in A2AARs. We have also examined the potential roles of carboxamide and several other amino acids in TM3. Using these approaches, we now identify putative binding sites in TM3 that interact with the adenosine adenine group and a revised model of ligand-A1AR interactions is proposed. The cDNA encoding the full-length human A1AR was provided by Dr. S. M. Reppert (Boston, MA). This cDNA has been extensively characterized (9Rivkees S.A. Lasbury M.E. Stiles G.L. Henergariu O. Vance G. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Mutant receptors were made by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overlap-extension method (10Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Primer pairs were designed to introduce mutations as described (11Barbhaiya H. McClain R. Ijzerman A. Rivkees S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1635-1642PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems Oligonucleotide Synthesizer (Foster City, CA). To generate the front part of mutant receptors, oligonucleotide primer pairs (primers A and B) were designed to generate a 5′ fragment of the A1AR. Another set of oligonucleotide primer pairs (primers C and D) was designed to generate a 3′ fragment of the A1AR receptor. B and C primers contained sequences that encoded for the desired mutations. Receptor fragments were generated using 1 μg of DNA as the substrate for PCR reactions, and PCR reactions were performed using the Gene Amp Kit reagents (Perkin Elmer). PCR was generally performed using 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were then separated on a 1% agarose gel and eluted. Receptor fragments (A-B and C-D) were then combined in a third PCR reaction to generate a full-length A1AR using flanking primers (A and D). Flanking PCR primers contained HindIII (A primers) orXbal (D primers) restriction endonuclease sites at the ends. After fusion reactions, PCR products were digested withHindIII and Xbal and were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen; San Diego, CA). Mutant receptors were then sequenced. Receptor cDNA expression was characterized using COS-7 cells as described (12Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). COS cells were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml), in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were acutely transfected using the DEAE-dextran method. 10-cm plates were individually transfected with 5–10 μg of DNA, or were sham transfected. At 48–72 h after transfection, cells were tested by radioreceptor assay. Under those conditions, we found that there was very little evidence of receptor-G protein coupling (7Rivkees S.A. Lasbury M.E. Barbhaiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20485-20490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), similar to that as reported by others (5Tucker A.L. Robeva A.S. Taylor H.E. Holeton D. Bockner M. Lynch K.R. Linden J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27900-27906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioligand binding studies were performed using intact cells as described (7Rivkees S.A. Lasbury M.E. Barbhaiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20485-20490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Barbhaiya H. McClain R. Ijzerman A. Rivkees S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1635-1642PubMed Google Scholar). The radioligands used were [3H]CCPA (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA; specific activity, 33 Ci/mmol) and [3H]DPCPX (NEN Life Science Products; specific activity, 100 Ci/mmol). All determinations were done in quadruplicate. When constructs with different levels of expression were compared, we adjusted tissue per tube so that amounts of specific binding per tube were similar among the different constructs. A model for the human A2AAR deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry 1mmh) by Van Rhee and co-workers (13Jiang Q. van Rhee A.M. Kim J. Yehle S. Wess J. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 512-521PubMed Google Scholar) was used for construction of our model of the human A1AR. First, the helical parts of the two sequences retrieved from the GPCR DataBase Project 2On WWW site:http://swift.embl-heidelberg.de/7tm/. were aligned as described by IJzerman et al. (14IJzerman A.P. van Galen P.J. Jacobson K.A. Drug Des. Discov. 1992; 9: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar) for the canine A1 and A2A receptors. Subsequently, all amino acid differences between the canine and human A1ARs were identified and converted to human A1AR motifs. NECA, the ligand present in the A2A receptor model, was changed to CPA, which is the reference agonist for A1ARs. Steric clashes between amino acid side chains and CPA were removed by rotation of side chains only. Guided by the results from the mutagenesis studies presented in this report, we included Leu-88, Thr-91, and Gln-92 in a putative N6-binding region. As a consequence, Ser-94, Thr-277, and His-278 were found to be close to the ribose moiety of CPA. After these manipulations, a short minimization procedure with default parameters was followed in which all side chains within 4 Å of CPA were relaxed. All calculations were performed with the software package QUANTA 96 (MSI, Waltham, MA, USA) running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo O2 workstation. Saturation and competition binding data were analyzed by computer using an iterative nonlinear regression program (15McPherson G.A. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1985; 14: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Comparisons among multiple groups were performed by one-way analysis of variance, with post-test comparison among groups performed by the Bonferroni method. Comparisons between paired groups were performed by the paired t test. The InStat, Vers. 3, statistics program (GraphPad; San Diego, CA) was used for statistical computations. All adenosinergic compounds tested were obtained from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA). To identify potential sites within TMs 1–4 that may play a role in conferring binding properties of A1ARs, differences in the amino acid sequences of A1 and A2AARs were identified. First, the amino acid sequences of all cloned A1ARs and A2AARs within TMs 1–4 of different species present in the GenBankTM data base were compared to identify common amino acids among the different species. Universal differences among all A1ARs and A2AARs were then identified. Using site-directed mutagenesis, human A1AR residues were replaced by the corresponding amino acids of A2AARs. Saturation studies were then performed using [3H]CCPA or [3H]DPCPX (Table I). Competition studies were next performed using a fixed dose of [3H]DPCPX and graded doses of DPCPX or CPA and several other compounds (Table II). These studies revealed similar ligand binding properties for the WT-A1AR and Cys-31, Phe-65, Phe-82, Lys-125, and Leu-144 mutant A1AR constructs (Tables 1 and 2). In contrast, when the WT-A1AR and the Gly-14 → Thr-14 constructs were compared, markedly increased affinity for agonists was seen for the mutant receptor, and when the Pro-25 → Leu-25 construct was examined, the affinity for agonists fell (Tables 1 and 2).Table IBinding affinities for [3H]CCPA and [3H]DPCPX in A1/A2A transposition studiesReceptor construct[3H]CCPA[3H]DPCPXK dB maxChange (from WT)K dB maxChange (from WT)nmfmol/mgnmfmol/mgWT A1AR0.6 ± 0.15550 ± 620.7 ± 0.2565 ± 75A1AR → A2AARGly14 → Thr140.007 ± 0.02*550 ± 620.0110.8 ± 0.3650 ± 341.1Pro25 → Leu251.8 ± 0.2*230 ± 803.00.7 ± 0.2346 ± 761.0Ile31 → Cys310.7 ± 0.1458 ± 341.20.8 ± 0.2546 ± 251.1Leu65 → Phe650.6 ± 0.1568 ± 541.00.7 ± 0.4498 ± 661.0Met82 → Phe820.7 ± 0.2412 ± 231.20.8 ± 0.2426 ± 211.1Ala125 → Lys1250.7 ± 0.1569 ± 811.20.7 ± 0.2512 ± 851.0Phe144 → Leu1440.6 ± 0.2396 ± 431.00.8 ± 0.2456 ± 841.1All values are means of three to six separate studies per construct.

Previous attempts aimed at modifying several hydroxyl or polar amino acids within TMs 1–4 that are unique to A1ARs domains failed to identify a site that interacts with the adenineN6 position (11Barbhaiya H. McClain R. Ijzerman A. Rivkees S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1635-1642PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of carboxamide sites within TMs 1–4 (Asn-70, Gln-92). These amino acids contain oxygen and nitrogen atoms that may form hydrogen bonds with similar atoms in adenosine. Ala-70 and Ala-92 constructs were thus generated and tested. Competition studies were then performed using a fixed dose of [3H]DPCPX and graded doses of CPA or DPCPX. When the Ala-70 construct was tested, no differences in affinity for ligands were seen in comparison with studies of the WT-A1AR. In contrast, the Ala-92 construct had markedly reduced affinity for CPA. Next, to assess potential regions of the adenosine molecule that could interact with Gln-92, competition studies were performed using compounds with (CPA, R-PIA) or without (NECA, 2 chloroadenosine)N6 substitutions. In comparison with that observed for the WT-A1AR, the affinity of each compound for the Ala-92 construct was markedly reduced. However, reductions in affinity for NECA and CADO were greater than reductions in affinity for CPA or R-PIA. When competition studies were performed using the compound N-0840, which is structurally similar to CPA but lacks a ribose group, the Ala-92 construct had markedly reduced affinity for the ligand as compared with the WT-A1AR. Because the above studies suggest that Gln-92 interacts with the adenine group, we next examined the role of other amino acids within TM3. First, we performed additional A1/A2AAR transposition studies at sites in TM3 (Pro-86 → Phe-86, Leu-96 → Phe-96). Competition studies showed that conversion of Leu-96 to Phe-96 did not alter ligand binding properties. However, after conversion of Pro-86 to Phe-86, the binding ofN6-substituted ligands (CPA, R-PIA) to the mutant construct was reduced more than 10-fold (Table II). Next, we tested the roles of Val-87, Leu-88, and Thr-91 in TM3 by converting these sites to alanine residues. Following conversion of Val-87 to Ala-87, no changes in ligand binding characteristics were seen (Table III). However, after Leu-88 or Thr-91 was converted to Ala, marked reductions in the affinity for agonists were observed (Table III). Competition studies were next performed using the compound N-0840. Suggesting that Thr-91 interacts with the adenine group, this construct had nearly 100-fold reduced affinity for N-0840.Table IIIKI values from competition of [3H]DPCPX binding in TM3 site-directed mutagenesis studiesDrugKI valuesVal → Ala87Leu → Ala88Thr → Ala91Gln → Ala92WT A1ARmNECA4.2 ± 4.3 E-61.5 ± 0.3 E-4*7.7 E-4*>1 E-4*5.1 ± 2.1 E-6Change from WT0.8229.4150>200CADO1.3 ± 2.9 E-61.1 ± 0.4 E-6>1 E-4*>1 E-4*1.0 ± 2.2 E-6Change from WT1.341>100>180R-PIA2.6 ± 1.1 E-71.8 ± 0.4 E-4*7.2 ± 1.2 E-5*2.6 ± 0.7 E-5*3.6 ± 2.4 E-7Change from WT0.7250020072CPA5.5 ± 1.0 E-74.2 ± 2.6 E-5*9.7 ± 3.3 E-6*1.3 ± 1.2 E-5*5.6 ± 3.2 E-7Change from WT1.0751723N 08402.3 ± 1.2 E-6>1 E-4*>1 E-4*>1 E-4*7.5 ± 1.2 E-7Change from WT3.0>100>100>100Values are means of three or more separate studies per drug in which samples were tested in quadruplicate in each study in side-by-side studies with the wild-type human A1AR. *, p < 0.05 by analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-test comparisonversus wild type A1AR.

Considering the above results suggesting that Thr-91 and Gln-92 influence adenine binding, molecular modeling of CPA-A1AR interactions was performed based on the structure of rhodopsin (16Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The results of computer modeling experiments are illustrated in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2 A, the upper part of the purine ring and theN6-substituent of CPA are shown interacting with residues on TM3 that were mutated in the present study (Thr-91 and Gln-92). Fig. 2 B represents the same interaction shown from a different angle. Because of the helical nature of TM3, Pro-86 cannot be brought close to CPA if Thr-91 and Gln-92 interact with CPA in a direct way (see also Fig. 2). Leu-88, however, is close to the cyclopentyl group of CPA, in line with its more prominent influence on the binding of N6-substituted agonists (CPA and R-PIA) than of NECA and CADO, both agonists withoutN6-substituents. Val-87, more distant from the cyclopentyl group than Leu-88, does not influence binding. Positioned in the manner shown, CPA will also interact with TM7, which is highlighted in Fig. 2 C. The ribose moiety is close to Thr- 277 and His-278 and also to Ser-94 (TM3), which are all amino acids shown to influence ligand binding (5Tucker A.L. Robeva A.S. Taylor H.E. Holeton D. Bockner M. Lynch K.R. Linden J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27900-27906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Townsend-Nicholson A. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2373-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of A1AR-ligand interactions have largely focused on the importance of sites in TMs 6–7 and have been used to generate models of adenosine-A1AR interactions (4Olah M.E. Ren H. Ostrowski J. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10764-10770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tucker A.L. Robeva A.S. Taylor H.E. Holeton D. Bockner M. Lynch K.R. Linden J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27900-27906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Townsend-Nicholson A. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2373-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these models, it is suggested that the ribose group interacts with TM7 and the adenine group interacts with TMs 6 and 7 (4Olah M.E. Ren H. Ostrowski J. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10764-10770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tucker A.L. Robeva A.S. Taylor H.E. Holeton D. Bockner M. Lynch K.R. Linden J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27900-27906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Townsend-Nicholson A. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2373-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the results of the site-directed mutagenesis studies presented in this report, a revised model of ligand-A1AR interactions is proposed in which the adenine group interacts with TM3, and the ribose group interacts with TMs 3 and 7. Modifications present on the N6 adenine position determine whether a ligand will be selective for A1ARs (8Tivedi B.K. Bridges A.J. Bruns R.F. Williams M. Adenosine and Adenosine Receptors. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1990: 57-103Crossref Google Scholar). Foremost in identifying potential residues that can interact with theN6 position is consideration of chimeric receptor studies showing that TMs 1–4 confer the ligand binding properties of A1ARs (7Rivkees S.A. Lasbury M.E. Barbhaiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20485-20490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, it is very likely that theN6 binding site will be located within TMs 1–4. Of the sites that we have tested, only mutations of Leu-88, Thr-91, or Gln-92 resulted in the differential reduction in the affinity ofN6-substituted and non-substituted ligands, suggesting that Leu-88, Thr-91, and Gln-92 interact with theN6 substituents. Other investigators have also observed differential reduction in the affinity ofN6-substituted (R-PIA) and non-substituted ligands (NECA) when the binding characteristics were compared for Thr-277 mutations (6Townsend-Nicholson A. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2373-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this reflects differences in binding of ribose substituents, not N6 substituents (6Townsend-Nicholson A. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2373-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we modified sites in TM1, we found that conversion of Gly-14 to Thr-14 resulted in increased affinity for agonists. In contrast, modification of Glu-16 in A1ARs and Glu-11 in A2AARs has been shown to result in decreased agonist affinity (11Barbhaiya H. McClain R. Ijzerman A. Rivkees S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1635-1642PubMed Google Scholar, 17IJzerman A.P. von Frijtag Drabbe Kunzel J.K. Kim J. Jiang Q. Jacobson K.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 310: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To date, direct interactions between small molecule ligands and sites in TM1 have yet to be demonstrated (18Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 19Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, because molecular modeling studies suggest that TM1 is juxtaposed with TM7 (16Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 18Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 19Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), it is possible that TM1 mutations indirectly influence ribose-TM7 interactions. Although less likely, we also recognize the possibility that ribose-hydroxy groups may interact with polar TM1 sites. Adenosine has several sites that can potentially interact with receptor amino acids (8Tivedi B.K. Bridges A.J. Bruns R.F. Williams M. Adenosine and Adenosine Receptors. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1990: 57-103Crossref Google Scholar). The adenine group contains five nitrogen atoms (N1, N3,N6, N7, andN9) that can interact with receptor sites, whereas the ribose moiety contains three hydroxyl groups (2′, 3′, 5′) (8Tivedi B.K. Bridges A.J. Bruns R.F. Williams M. Adenosine and Adenosine Receptors. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1990: 57-103Crossref Google Scholar). Within the adenine group, removal of either of theN6, N7, andN9 nitrogen atoms results in more than a 1000-fold loss in affinity for A1ARs (8Tivedi B.K. Bridges A.J. Bruns R.F. Williams M. Adenosine and Adenosine Receptors. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1990: 57-103Crossref Google Scholar). Removal of theN1 and N3 nitrogen molecules results in 10- and 100-fold reductions in affinity for A1ARs, respectively (8Tivedi B.K. Bridges A.J. Bruns R.F. Williams M. Adenosine and Adenosine Receptors. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1990: 57-103Crossref Google Scholar). The three ribose-hydroxyl groups also are very important for binding, as removal of these groups results in significant reduction in the affinity for A1ARs (8Tivedi B.K. Bridges A.J. Bruns R.F. Williams M. Adenosine and Adenosine Receptors. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1990: 57-103Crossref Google Scholar). Previous models of adenosine-A1AR interactions have been guided by site-directed mutagenesis studies of sites in TMs 5–7 (14IJzerman A.P. van Galen P.J. Jacobson K.A. Drug Des. Discov. 1992; 9: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the possible importance of His-250 in TM6 and His-278 in TM7, IJzerman and co-workers (14IJzerman A.P. van Galen P.J. Jacobson K.A. Drug Des. Discov. 1992; 9: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the 2′ and 3′-hydroxyl groups of CPA interact with His-278, and the N6position interacts with His-250 in TM6. However, the primary amino acid sequence is very similar between A1 and A2AARs in this putative N6 binding region (14IJzerman A.P. van Galen P.J. Jacobson K.A. Drug Des. Discov. 1992; 9: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar), making it difficult for this model to account for the considerably different binding properties of A1AR and A2AARs. In the past, models for the adenosine A1, A2A, and A3ARs receptor have been based on the structural template of bacteriorhodopsin (14IJzerman A.P. van Galen P.J. Jacobson K.A. Drug Des. Discov. 1992; 9: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar, 20IJzerman A.P. van der Wenden E.M. van Galen P.J. Jacobson K.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 268: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21van Galen P.J. van Bergen A.H. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Melman N. Olah M.E. IJzerman A.P. Stiles G.L. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar). Since those studies, the structure of mammalian rhodopsin has been studied in greater detail (16Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), revealing similarity to the structure of bacteriorhodopsin. The relative positions of the TMs 3 and 7 in rhodopsin, however, are closer to each other than in bacteriorhodopsin (16Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Considering the importance of sites in TM3 and TM7 on ligand-A1AR interactions shown in these and other studies (4Olah M.E. Ren H. Ostrowski J. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10764-10770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tucker A.L. Robeva A.S. Taylor H.E. Holeton D. Bockner M. Lynch K.R. Linden J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27900-27906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Townsend-Nicholson A. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2373-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we therefore decided to generate a rhodopsin-based model for the human A1AR. As shown in Fig. 2 C, TMs 3 and 7 are in close proximity in this A1AR model, particularly where the ribose moiety of CPA is suggested to bind to Ser-94, Thr-277, and His- 278, which are residues that are essential for agonist binding (6Townsend-Nicholson A. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2373-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Barbhaiya H. McClain R. Ijzerman A. Rivkees S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1635-1642PubMed Google Scholar). Our model also suggests that the adenine group interacts with TM3. There is considerable support for this notion. First, mutation of residues in the human adenosine A2AAR sites that are equivalent to Thr-91 and Gln-92 have been shown to affect ligand binding (13Jiang Q. van Rhee A.M. Kim J. Yehle S. Wess J. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 512-521PubMed Google Scholar). Second, photoaffinity labeling studies using an antagonist compound show that adenosinergic compounds interact with TM3 (22Kennedy A.P. Mangum K.C. Linden J. Wells J.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 789-798PubMed Google Scholar). Third, mutation of sites in TM3 alter the binding of the antagonist N-0840, which can be regarded as CPA without the ribose moiety (8Tivedi B.K. Bridges A.J. Bruns R.F. Williams M. Adenosine and Adenosine Receptors. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1990: 57-103Crossref Google Scholar). Structure-activity relationships forN6-substituted adenines like N-0848 are quite similar to those of N6-substituted adenosines (23Ukena D. Padgett W.L. Hong O. Daly J.W. Daly D.T. Olsson R.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating that the N6-substituents of both adenosine agonists and adenine antagonists coincide and occupy the same binding site. The compound N-0861, the norbornanyl variant of N-0840, also is very selective for A1, supporting the notion that the N6-substituents of N-0840 and CPA coincide (24Shryock J.C. Travagli H.C. Belardinelli L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 260: 1292-1299PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our model, the two aliphatic, lipophilic residues Val-87 (the equivalent of the aspartate residue important for binding in many biogenic amine receptors) and Leu-88 could have a favorable interaction with the N6-cyclopentyl substituent in CPA. However, mutation studies showed that only Leu-88 influences the binding of N6-substituted agonists, with the affinity for R-RIA reduced by the greatest extent. Because R-PIA has the longest and most hydrophobic N6-side chains of the ligands tested (8Tivedi B.K. Bridges A.J. Bruns R.F. Williams M. Adenosine and Adenosine Receptors. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1990: 57-103Crossref Google Scholar), these observations support the notion that Leu-88 interacts with hydrophobicN6-substituents. Additional support for this possibility comes from observations that mutations at Thr-91 and Gln-92 affected CPA binding less than NECA or CADO binding. Interaction ofN6-substituents with Leu-88 may thus facilitate agonist in the absence of sites that interact with the nitrogen ring, possibly at the N6 nitrogen. The Pro-86 → Phe-86 mutation also induced broad decreases in the affinities of all compounds studied. However, our model suggests that this is an indirect effect, as Pro-86 is quite distant from CPA. Thus, it is possible that Pro-86 alters the conformation of TM1 in A1ARs to favor the binding ofN6-substituents to A1ARs. We recognize that our model does not yet accommodate the role of other sites that may influence the conformational state of A1ARs and indirectly influence adenosine-A1AR interactions. As mentioned above, modification of sites in TM1 of A1ARs (Thr-14, Glu-16) and A2AARs (Glu-13) induces broad changes in the affinity for agonists, whereas Asp-55 in TM2 of A1ARs mediates allosteric effects of sodium ions on ligand binding (11Barbhaiya H. McClain R. Ijzerman A. Rivkees S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1635-1642PubMed Google Scholar). Sites in the second extracellular loop also may influence adenosine-AR interactions (25Olah M.E. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24692-24698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the large number of potential interaction sites in the adenosine molecule (8Tivedi B.K. Bridges A.J. Bruns R.F. Williams M. Adenosine and Adenosine Receptors. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1990: 57-103Crossref Google Scholar), it is therefore likely that adenosine ligand-receptor interactions will be quite complex. For the present, our revised model of CPA-A1AR interactions, now provides a conceptual framework for explaining the role of TM3 in ligand binding and A1AR ligand selectivity.

https://openalex.org/W2007123049,"Our previous studies have shown that human native low density lipoprotein (LDL) can be oxidized by activated human monocytes. In this process, both activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and induction of superoxide anion (O·̄2) production are required. PKC is a family of isoenzymes, and the functional roles of individual PKC isoenzymes are believed to differ based on subcellular location and distinct responses to regulatory signals. We have shown that the PKC isoenzyme that is required for both monocyte O·̄2 production and oxidation of LDL is a member of the conventional PKC group of PKC isoenzymes (Li, Q., and Cathcart, M. K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 17508–17515). The conventional PKC group includes PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ. With the exception of PKCγ, each of these isoenzymes was detected in human monocytes. In these studies, we investigated the requirement for select PKC isoenzymes in the process of monocyte-mediated LDL lipid oxidation. Our data indicate that PKC activity was rapidly induced upon monocyte activation with the majority of the activity residing in the membrane/particulate fraction. This enhanced PKC activity was sustained for up to 24 h after activation. PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII protein levels were induced upon monocyte activation, and PKCα and PKCβII substantially shifted their location from the cytosol to the particulate/membrane fraction. To distinguish between these isoenzymes for regulating monocyte O·̄2 production and LDL oxidation, PKCα or PKCβ isoenzyme-specific antisense oligonucleotides were used to selectively suppress isoenzyme expression. We found that suppression of PKCα expression inhibited both monocyte-mediated O·̄2 production and LDL lipid oxidation by activated human monocytes. In contrast, inhibition of PKCβ expression (including both PKCβI and PKCβII) did not affect O·̄2 production or LDL lipid oxidation. Further studies demonstrated that the respiratory burst oxidase responsible for O·̄2 production remained functionally intact in monocytes with depressed levels of PKCα because O·̄2 production could be restored by treating the monocytes with arachidonic acid. Taken together, our data reveal that PKCα, and not PKCβI or PKCβII, is the predominant isoenzyme required for O·̄2 production and maximal oxidation of LDL by activated human monocytes.

It has been suggested that monocyte-mediated low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; MDA, malondialdehyde (1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane); ODN, oligodeoxyribonucleotide(s); PKC, protein kinase C; cPKC, conventional PKC; SOD, superoxide dismutase; ZOP, opsonized zymosan; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; TBA, thiobarbituric acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; MDA, malondialdehyde (1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane); ODN, oligodeoxyribonucleotide(s); PKC, protein kinase C; cPKC, conventional PKC; SOD, superoxide dismutase; ZOP, opsonized zymosan; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; TBA, thiobarbituric acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. oxidation may play an important role in atherogenesis and inflammatory tissue injury (reviewed in Ref. 1Chisolm G.M. Penn M.S. Fuster V. Ross R. Topol E. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Disease. Raven Press, New York1996: 129-149Google Scholar). Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that human monocytes develop the ability to oxidize native LDL lipids only upon activation, thereby transforming LDL into an in vitro cytotoxin (2Cathcart M.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 3Cathcart M.K. McNally A.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1963-1969PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in monocyte-mediated LDL lipid oxidation are not fully understood. We previously reported that superoxide anion (O·̄2) released upon activation of human monocytes was required for monocyte-mediated LDL oxidation, because removal of O·̄2 by superoxide dismutase prevented LDL oxidation (2Cathcart M.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 3Cathcart M.K. McNally A.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1963-1969PubMed Google Scholar). General antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene, vitamin E, and ascorbate also inhibited monocyte-mediated oxidation of LDL (2Cathcart M.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 4Kita T. Nagano Y. Yokode M. Ishii K. Kume N. Ooshima A. Yoshida H. Kawai C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We also found that increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels, cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity, and protein kinase C (PKC) activity were required for monocyte-mediated LDL lipid oxidation (6Li Q. Tallant A. Cathcart M.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol.

We routinely measure monocyte-mediated LDL oxidation at 24 h after monocyte activation, a time when considerable oxidation products have accumulated and the oxidation begins to plateau. In our earlier studies, PKC activity was shown to contribute to LDL lipid oxidation both early and late during the 24-h incubation period (7Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17508-17515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To date at least 12 isoenzymes of PKC having differential activator responsiveness, cellular distribution, and substrate specificity have been reported in mammalian tissue. They are divided into three major groups: conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, and θ), and atypical PKCs (ζ, λ, μ, and ι) (reviewed in Ref. 9Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Although only cPKCs are Ca2+-dependent, all three groups of PKCs are believed to participate in signal transduction (9Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 10Buchner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and accumulating evidence suggests that PKC isoenzymes likely play unique roles and induce different functional changes within cells.In previous studies, we found that a Ca2+-dependent cPKC was involved in the process of O·̄2 production and required for LDL lipid oxidation by activated monocytes (7Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17508-17515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we therefore initiated studies to identify which cPKC isoenzyme(s) was involved in these processes. In the present studies, PKC isoenzyme-specific antisense oligonucleotides (ODN) were carefully designed and then used to suppress the expression of individual isoenzymes. After establishing efficacy and selectivity of antisense inhibition by Western analysis, the ODN were then tested for their effects on monocyte-mediated O·̄2 production and LDL lipid oxidation. Our data demonstrate that PKCα, but not PKCβI or PKCβII, regulates monocyte O·̄2 production as well as monocyte-mediated LDL lipid oxidation.RESULTSPKC activity in cytosol and particulate/membrane fractions was investigated at various times after human monocyte activation. ZOP was used as the monocyte activator. The data from a representative experiment are summarized in Fig. 1. PKC activity was induced very quickly in ZOP-activated human monocytes. Activity was first detected in the cytosolic fraction and then in the particulate/membrane fraction. At 1 h post activation, the predominant activity was found in the membrane-containing particulate fraction. Although cytosolic PKC activity reached a maximum within 1 h of activation, activity dropped somewhat to a plateau level that remained stable and substantially higher than basal levels throughout the 24 h incubation. On the other hand, PKC activity in the particulate/membrane fraction accounted for the majority of the activity by 1 h after activation and maintained this higher level of activity throughout the 24-h incubation. These data indicate that upon activation monocyte PKC activity is substantially induced in both fractions but to a greater degree in the particulate fraction.The presence of various PKC isoenzyme proteins was then evaluated in unactivated and activated human monocytes by Western blotting using PKC isoenzyme-specific antibodies. As summarized in Fig.2, PKCα and PKCβI were detected in unactivated monocytes. Although not evident in this blot low levels of PKCδ were sometimes observed in immunoblots of unactivated monocytes. PKCβII was barely detectable in unactivated monocytes as well. Interestingly, each of the PKC isoenzymes were induced upon activation, and as expected, PKCγ was not detected in human monocytes regardless of the activation state. Because our previous studies indicated that cPKC activity was required for monocyte-mediated LDL lipid oxidation (7Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17508-17515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in further studies we focused on the members of the cPKC group of isoenzymes that are detectable in these cells, namely PKCα, βI, and βII.Figure 2Induction of PKC isoenzymes in ZOP-activated human monocytes. Human monocytes (2.5 × 106cells/ml, a total of 10 × 106 cells/group) were incubated in the presence or absence of ZOP (2 mg/ml) for 24 h. After incubation, cell lysates were prepared and separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE. The proteins from the PAGE gel were transferred to PVDF by the semi-dry method. Individual PKC isoenzymes were detected with rabbit anti-human PKC isoenzyme-specific antibodies, followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The protein bands were developed by ECL. A, induction of PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII. 100 μg of protein was loaded on each lane. B, induction of PKCε, PKCδ, and PKCζ.

Results obtained from one of three similar experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The cellular partitioning of PKCα and PKCβ isoenzymes was then examined in unactivated and activated (24 h) human monocytes. In Fig.3, a Western blot is shown where equal amounts of protein are loaded in each lane. To adequately assess the induction and intracellular location of the isoenzymes, the relative density of each band was corrected for the total protein content in the fraction, and these data are given in TableI. Of the three isoforms of PKC that we examined, only PKCβI was predominantly located in the particulate/membrane fraction in unactivated monocytes. PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII all increased in the particulate/membrane fraction upon monocyte activation. When corrected for the total protein content of the fractions, it is evident that although PKCα was induced to a lesser extent than PKCβI or PKCβII, it showed the most dramatic relocation to the particulate/membrane fraction upon activation. It should be noted that the apparent induction level of the PKCβ II isoform may be inflated due to the barely detectable basal level and calculation as fold induction.Figure 3Particulate/membrane versuscytosolic location of PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII isoenzymes in unactivated and ZOP-activated human monocytes. Human monocytes (2.5 × 106 cells/ml, a total of 10 × 106 cells/group) were incubated in the presence or absence of ZOP (2 mg/ml) for 24 h. After incubation, cell lysates were made. The cytosol and the particulate/membrane were separated from postnuclear supernatants by ultracentrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A total of 100 μg of protein was loaded in each lane on 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins, separated by SDS gels, were transferred to PVDF by the semi-dry method. Individual PKC isoenzymes were detected by Western blotting. The lanes marked with the letter c represent the cytosolic fractions, whereas those with the letter p represent the particulate/membrane fractions.

Open table in a new tab To further discriminate between PKCα and PKCβ isoenzymes as regulators of O·̄2 production and monocyte-mediated LDL oxidation, PKC isoenzyme-specific antisense ODN treatment was used. The antisense ODN sequences for PKCα (recognizing only this isoenzyme) and PKCβ (recognizing both PKCβI and PKCβII) were selected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In these experiments, human monocytes were pretreated in the presence or absence of PKC isoenzyme-specific antisense or sense ODN for 20 h. Monocytes were then exposed to fresh ODN and ZOP for 24 h in RPMI 1640. After activation, cell lysates were then prepared, and the expression of PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII isoenzymes was examined by Western blotting (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of human monocytes with either PKCα or PKCβ antisense ODN markedly inhibited their relevant specific PKC isoenzyme expression. In each of these cases, the level of expression in antisense-treated monocytes was reduced in an isoenzyme-selective manner as compared with either the untreated or sense-treated monocytes. The lower expression of PKCβI by activated monocytes depicted in lane 2 of Fig.4 A was not characteristic of other blots that showed approximately equal levels of this isoform in unactivated and activated monocytes. The PKCβ antisense ODN treatment consistently inhibited the expression of both PKCβI and PKCβII. The sense ODN control for the PKCβ antisense sometimes caused partial inhibition of PKCβ expression, but the sense control ODN did not affect either LDL lipid oxidation or O·̄2 production (see Fig. 6). These data, taken together, provide further support for the independence of these processes from PKCβ activity.Figure 4PKC isoenzyme-specific antisense ODN inhibit isoenzyme protein expression. Human monocytes (2.5 × 106 cells/ml, a total of 10 × 106cells/group) were incubated for 20 h in the presence or absence of PKC isoenzyme-specific antisense or sense ODN (10 μm). The medium was changed to RPMI 1640, and additional ODN were added (10 μm) as well as ZOP (2 mg/ml) and the incubation continued for 24 h. After incubation, cell lysates were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A total of 100 μg of protein was loaded in each lane on 8% SDS-PAGE.

Human monocytes (1 × 106 cells/ml) were pretreated in the presence or absence of PKC isoenzyme-specific antisense or sense ODN (10 μm) for 20 h. After pretreatment, the monocytes were activated with ZOP (2 mg/ml) and monocyte-mediated O·̄2 production or PKC isoenzyme expression were determined at 1 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, superoxide anion production.

Expression of PKCα, βI, and βII isoenzymes was determined in antisense and sense ODN pretreated monocytes after 1 h of ZOP activation by Western blotting according to protocols described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression levels of the PKC isoenzymes were similar between sense ODN pretreated and untreated monocytes, and antisense ODN to PKCα did not inhibit expression of PKCβ isoforms and vice versa (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The PKCα antisense ODN was also examined for potential nonspecific inhibition of other isoforms of PKC as illustrated inFig.4 B. It is evident from these results that PKCα antisense ODN treatment selectively inhibited the expression of PKCα and not PKCβI, PKCβII, PKCδ, PKCε, or PKCζ and that treatment with PKCβ antisense ODN selectively inhibited the expression of both PKCβ isoforms without inhibiting the expression of PKCα.To investigate the potential influence of PKCα and PKCβ on LDL lipid oxidation, human monocyte-mediated LDL lipid oxidation was examined after PKC isoenzyme-specific antisense ODN treatment. Human monocytes were pretreated in the presence or absence of PKC isoenzyme-specific antisense or sense ODN. After activation with ZOP for 24 h in the presence of additional ODN, LDL lipid oxidation was determined by the TBA assay. As shown in Fig.5, substantial LDL lipid oxidation was observed upon human monocyte activation. LDL lipid oxidation was markedly inhibited in the presence of PKCα isoenzyme-specific antisense ODN. In contrast, LDL lipid oxidation was unaffected by treatment with PKCα sense ODN or PKCβ isoenzyme-specific antisense or sense ODN. These data suggest that PKCα is an essential enzyme for activation-induced monocyte-mediated LDL lipid oxidation and that PKCβI and PKCβII are not involved.Figure 5Inhibition of PKCα expression suppresses human monocyte-mediated LDL lipid oxidation. Human monocytes (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated 20 h in the presence or absence of PKC isoenzyme-specific antisense or sense ODN (10 μm). The medium was changed to RPMI, and the pretreated cells were exposed to LDL (0.5 mg cholesterol/ml) in the presence or absence of ZOP (2 mg/ml) with additional ODN (10 μm) added to the ODN-pretreated cells.

LDL oxidation in samples from monocytes pretreated and cotreated with antisense to PKCα was significantly inhibited as compared with all other groups with the exception of unactivated monocytes (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In previous studies, we found that O·̄2 production was required for the process of monocyte-mediated LDL lipid oxidation, therefore, the effects of PKC isoenzyme-specific antisense ODN treatment on O·̄2 production were also examined. Human monocytes were preincubated with either PKCα or PKCβ isoenzyme-specific antisense or sense ODN for 20 h. After preincubation, monocytes were activated with ZOP for 1 h during which time monocyte-mediated O·̄2 production was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures” or lysates were prepared for analysis of isoenzyme expression. As expected, O·̄2 production was induced in ZOP-activated human monocytes (Fig.6 A). PKCα antisense ODN treatment substantially inhibited O·̄2 production by activated human monocytes, whereas other ODN were without effect. Data presented in Fig. 6 B indicate that antisense ODN treatment caused isoenzyme inhibition under these conditions. The levels of PKC isoenzymes in the sense ODN pretreated and 1 h activated monocytes was similar to that in untreated, 1 h activated monocytes (data not shown). Additionally, antisense ODN to PKCα did not inhibit expression of PKCβ isoforms and vice versa (data not shown), thus confirming similar results illustrated in Fig. 4.Evidence that treatment with PKCα antisense ODN did not damage the components of the respiratory burst oxidase (NADPH oxidase) complex were derived from experiments in which superoxide anion production by antisense pretreated, activated monocytes was restored by inclusion of the anionic amphiphile, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid has been shown to directly activate the NADPH oxidase and circumvent requirements for PKC activity in guinea pig macrophages activated by Fcγ (20Sakata A. Ida E. Tominaga M. Onoue K. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4353-4359PubMed Google Scholar). The results of one of three experiments illustrating this restoration of O·̄2 production are depicted in Fig.7. Treatment with antisense ODN significantly inhibited superoxide anion production (p< 0.05). This inhibition was ablated by the inclusion of arachidonic acid resulting in enhanced superoxide anion production to levels that were not significantly different from the amount produced by activated monocytes or activated monocytes treated with sense ODN.Figure 7Activity of the respiratory burst oxidase (NADPH oxidase) can be restored by addition of arachidonic acid.Human monocytes (1 × 106 cells/ml) were pretreated in the presence or absence of PKCα isoenzyme-specific antisense or sense ODN (10 μm) for 20 h. After pretreatment, the monocytes were incubated with or without the monocyte activator ZOP (2 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of arachidonic acid (1 μg/ml), and monocyte-mediated O·̄2 production was determined at 1 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The open barrepresents superoxide production by unactivated monocytes. Theclosed bar represents results with activated monocytes.Hatched bars represent O·̄2 production production by monocytes that were pretreated with PKCα antisense ODN, andcross-hatched bars represent O·̄2 production by monocytes that were pretreated with PKCα sense ODN.

Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17508-17515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cPKC group of PKC isoenzymes consists of four individual isoenzymes, including PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ. Although PKCγ is not present in human monocytes, the other three cPKC isoenzymes remained as viable candidates for the requisite cPKC activity required in the process of monocyte-mediated LDL oxidation and O·̄2 production.Activation of PKC is believed to involve the translocation of the enzyme from a cytosolic location in unstimulated cells to new subcellular sites present in the nucleus or particulate/membrane fractions of stimulated cells (reviewed in Ref. 21Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Intracellular translocation is believed to be mediated by intracellular receptors for PKC termed RACKs because inhibition of the RACK binding site of a specific isoenzyme can block its translocation and relevant biologic response (22Yedovitzky M. Mochly-Rosen D. Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Ron D. Abramovitch E. Cerasi E. Nesher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1417-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our studies presented in Fig. 1 reveal that PKC activity is substantially induced in both the cytosol and particulate fractions of activated human monocytes and that the predominant activity resides in the particulate fraction after 1 h of activation. These findings are similar to those reported by Kadri-Hassani et al. (23Kadri-Hassani N. Leger C.L. Descomps B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15111-15118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40)"
https://openalex.org/W2169971858,"Sec12p is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Sar1 GTPase and functions at the very upstream in the vesicle budding reactions from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We previously identified three yeast loci, RST1, RST2, andRST3, whose mutations suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth of the sec12–4 mutant (Nakano, A. (1996)J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 120, 642–646). In the present study, we cloned the wild-type RST2 gene by complementation of the cold-sensitive phenotype of therst2–1 mutant. RST2 turned out to be identical to HRR25, a gene encoding a dual-specificity casein kinase I in yeast. The rst2–1 mutation, which is now renamedhrr25–2, was due to the T176I amino acid replacement in the kinase domain. This mutation remedied not only the temperature-sensitive growth but also the defect of ER-to-Golgi protein transport of sec12. Immunoprecipitation of the hemagglutinin-tagged Hrr25–2 protein and a subsequent protein kinase assay showed that the kinase activity of the mutant protein was markedly reduced. The overproduction of another kinase-minus mutant of Hrr25p (Hrr25p K38A) slightly suppressed the growth defect ofsec12–4 as well. These observations suggest that the reduction of the kinase activity in the mutant protein is important for the suppression of sec12. We propose that Hrr25p negatively regulates the vesicle budding from the ER. Sec12p is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Sar1 GTPase and functions at the very upstream in the vesicle budding reactions from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We previously identified three yeast loci, RST1, RST2, andRST3, whose mutations suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth of the sec12–4 mutant (Nakano, A. (1996)J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 120, 642–646). In the present study, we cloned the wild-type RST2 gene by complementation of the cold-sensitive phenotype of therst2–1 mutant. RST2 turned out to be identical to HRR25, a gene encoding a dual-specificity casein kinase I in yeast. The rst2–1 mutation, which is now renamedhrr25–2, was due to the T176I amino acid replacement in the kinase domain. This mutation remedied not only the temperature-sensitive growth but also the defect of ER-to-Golgi protein transport of sec12. Immunoprecipitation of the hemagglutinin-tagged Hrr25–2 protein and a subsequent protein kinase assay showed that the kinase activity of the mutant protein was markedly reduced. The overproduction of another kinase-minus mutant of Hrr25p (Hrr25p K38A) slightly suppressed the growth defect ofsec12–4 as well. These observations suggest that the reduction of the kinase activity in the mutant protein is important for the suppression of sec12. We propose that Hrr25p negatively regulates the vesicle budding from the ER. The secretory pathway begins from the ER. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CKI, casein kinase I; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HA, hemagglutinin; ts, temperature-sensitive; DTT, dithiothreitol; ORF, open reading frame; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; kb, kilobase pair(s) . By genetic approaches with yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, many secretory genes have been identified in the whole pathway, and more than 20 genes are now known to function in the transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Among these genes, SEC12 and SAR1 are believed to play pivotal roles in the earliest step, that is the formation of transport vesicles from the ER. SAR1 encodes a 21-kDa GTPase (Sar1p) (1Nakano A. Muramatsu M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), which functions as a molecular switch to recruit a coat protein complex, COPII, onto the ER membrane (2Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar);SEC12 codes for a 70-kDa integral membrane protein (Sec12p) in the ER and acts as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) toward Sar1p, which converts Sar1p from the inactive GDP form to the active GTP form (3Barlowe C. Schekman R. Nature. 1993; 365: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Sar1p-GTP promotes the assembly of COPII (Sar1p, Sec13p/Sec31p, and Sec23p/Sec24p) (2Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, Sec12p is the most upstream player in the vesicle budding from the ER as far as we know. However, little is known as to when and how the GEF activity of Sec12p is triggered in this earliest event of vesicle budding. The regulation of Sec12p function may be a key issue for understanding the mechanisms of cargo and resident selection in the vesicle budding event. We recently identified three genetic loci, RST1,RST2, and RST3, whose mutations suppressed the temperature-sensitive (ts) growth defect of the sec12–4mutant (5Nakano A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These genes were expected to be the candidates of Sec12p regulators. RST1–1 was a dominant mutation and caused elevated expression of Sec12p. rst2 and rst3 were recessive and gave pleiotropic phenotypes including slow growth at low temperature, aggregation of cells, and heterogeneous glycosylation of Sec12p. In this study, we extended characterization of therst2–1 mutant and cloned the wild-type RST2 gene by complementation. The yeast strains used in this study were MBY10–7A (sec12–4 ura3–52 leu2–3, 112 trp1–289 his3 his4 suc gal2 MAT a) (6Nakano A. Brada D. Schekman R. J.

The cells were grown at 37 °C (for STR2), 30 °C or 23 °C (for MBY10–7A and MBY10–7C) in YP medium (2% (w/v) polypeptone (Nihon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 1% (w/v) yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Inc., Detroit, MI)) containing 2% (w/v) glucose (YPD) or in MC medium (0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco Laboratories), and 0.5% (w/v) casamino acids (Difco Laboratories)) containing 2% (w/v) glucose (MCD) supplemented appropriately. For derepression of the GAL1 promoter, MC medium was supplemented with 5% galactose and 0.2% sucrose (MCGS). A yeast replication plasmid (pJJ215), a single-copy plasmid (pRS314), a multicopy plasmid (pYO324), and an integration plasmid (pRS304) were described previously (7Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 9Ohya Y. Goebl M. Goodman L.E. Petersen-Bjørn S. Friesen J.D. Tamanoi F. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12356-12360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another multicopy plasmid, pQR324, was provided by H. Qadota of the Nara Institute of Science and Technology. For the cloning of theRST2 gene, the strain STR2 (rst2–1 sec12–4), which shows a Cs−Ts+ phenotype, was transformed with a genomic library (10Yoshihisa T. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) constructed on YEp13, which contains the LEU2 gene as the selectable marker. Electroporation was used to obtain high transformation efficiency (see below). Transformants were plated in 5–6 ml of regeneration top agar containing 1× MVD, 1 m sorbitol, 2.5% agar, and appropriate supplements and incubated at 24 °C. After 5–6 days, large colonies were picked up, streaked, and further incubated at 15 and 37 °C. Among eight candidates we obtained, one clone (named P2–3) reproducibly conferred Cs+Ts− growth to the STR2 cells. This plasmid was recovered from the yeast transformant. After the confirmation of the phenotypes by retransformation, the genomic insert was subcloned and subjected to further complementation tests. From a saturation culture in 50 ml of YPD, STR2 cells were harvested and washed two times with sterile distilled water. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, and 100 μl of 1 m DTT. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the cells were centrifuged at 1800 × g for 5 min and resuspended in the spheroplasting buffer (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 1 msorbitol, and 0.5% glucose). Zymolyase-100T (Seikagaku Corp.) (5 mg) was added to the cell suspension, and incubation was continued for 10–20 min at 30 °C. The Zymolyase-treated samples were overlaid on 25 ml of 1.4 m sorbitol solution and centrifuged at 1800 × g. Spheroplasted pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1 m sorbitol and kept on ice until use for electroporation. For electroporation, 4 μg of DNA (up to 10 μl) was added to a 100-μl aliquot of the spheroplast suspension. The samples were mixed gently and put on ice 5 min prior to electroporation, and then transferred to a cold sterile cuvette (0.4 cm) and subjected to electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene PulserTM; pulse at 1.5 kV, 25 microfarads, 200 watts for 3 s). Immediately after electroporation, 100 μl of 1 m sorbitol solution was added and the samples were spread on MVD plates (with adequate supplements) containing 1 m sorbitol. The AflII-AflII fragment ofHRR25 was amplified with an NheI site created near the 5′-terminus of the ORF by PCR (primer sequences: 5′-TCTATGGACTTAAGAGCTAGCGTAGGAAGGAAATTT-3′ and 5′-TCTACCGCTTAAGTATCTGTAGACGCG-3′). The resulting NheI site-containing fragment was used to replace the original HRR25 AflII-AflII fragment. The DNA cassette encoding three tandem repeats of the HA epitope was excised from pYT11 byNheI digestion (11Takita Y. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and inserted into the NheI site of the above construction. The resulting plasmid was named pAM5–2 (2μ 3HA-HRR25 TRP1). The expression of3HA-HRR25 was confirmed by immunoblotting with the monoclonal anti-HA antibody 16B12 (Berkeley Antibody). A plasmid harboring 3HA-rst2–1, pAM6–2 (2μ 3HA-rst2–1 TRP1), was constructed from pAM1–5 (2μ rst2–1 TRP1) by substituting the AflII-AflII fragment of pAM5–2 for that of pAM1–5. pAM1–5 is the plasmid containing the mutant allele rst2–1, which was obtained by the allele recovery method. The HRR25 expression plasmid, pAM4–1 (2μ GAL1promoter 3HA-HRR25 URA3), was constructed as follows. AHindIII site was created just before the initiation codon ofHRR25 by PCR. The BamHI-HindIII fragment containing 3HA-HRR25 was subcloned into pYES2 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands), which is a 2μ-based multicopy plasmid carrying the GAL1 promoter and a selectableURA3 marker. The K38A mutation in3HA-HRR25 was created by PCR with the following primers: for N-terminal fragment, 5′-GGCTCGAGGAAAGCATTTTGG-3′ (hrr25 XHOI) and 5′-CGATTCCAGAGCGATGGCTAC-3′ (hrr25 XHOI KA); for C-terminal fragment, 5′-GTAGCCATCGCTCTGGAATCG-3′ (hrr25 NCOI KA) and 5′-CTCGGATCCCCATGGCAAAGAACCCTT-3′ (hrr25 NCOI). The mutation was introduced by the first PCR with hrr25 XHOI KA/hrr25 XHOI and hrr25 NCOI KA/hrr25 NCOI and the produced fragments were amplified by the second PCR with hrr25 XHOI and hrr25 NCOI. The resulting 0.9-kbXhoI-NcoI fragment was used to replace the corresponding region of 3HA-HRR25 to yield the3HA-HRR25 K38A mutant allele. Immunoprecipitation kinase assays with HA-tagged Hrr25p were performed by the method described (12Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Nash R. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1992; 115: 1773-1784Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 13Ho Y. Mason S. Kobayashi R. Hoekstra M.F. Andrews B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The HRR25 deletion strain (AMY7–4B) was transformed with plasmids containing 3HA-HRR25, 3HA-rst2–1, or non-tagged HRR25 (2μ TRP1) and grown in YPD. Cells in a 100-ml culture were harvested at 2 OD600/ml and resuspended in 500 μl of IPK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin, and phosphatase inhibitor (0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride)). Glass beads (200 mg) were added to the cell suspension in 2-ml screw-capped tubes, and the samples were lysed by vigorous vortexing without heating. The materials were centrifuged and supernatants were transferred to fresh screw-capped tubes containing 300 μl of IPK buffer. After the addition of 2 μl of 1 mg/ml anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5; Boehringer Mannheim) to each 200 μg of total protein, the samples were kept on ice for 2 h and mixed with 10 μl of 50% Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B at 4 °C for 2 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation for 10 s in a microtube, and washed twice with IPK buffer, twice with 1 mNaCl in IPK buffer without inhibitor, and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). Each sample was resuspended in 15 μl of kinase buffer and split 1:2; one third was transferred to a fresh screw-capped tube for kinase assays, and the remainder was spun down, aspirated dry, boiled briefly in the 1× SDS-PAGE sampling buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates for the kinase assay were washed again with kinase buffer, dried, and resuspended in 15 μl of kinase buffer prior to preincubation at 37 °C for 10 min. The kinase assay was initiated by adding 5 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (final ATP concentration = 1 mm; 3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). Reactions were terminated after 15 min with 2 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sampling buffer and heated to 95 °C for 2 min before electrophoresis. The gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography using BAS2500 (Fuji Film). To examine whether rst2–1 suppresses not only the temperature-sensitive growth defect but also the secretory defect of the sec12–4 mutation, we performed a pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiment with the anti-carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) antibody (Fig. 1, upper panel). In the wild-type cells, newly synthesized CPY undergoes stepwise processing from the 67-kDa ER precursor (p1) through the 69-kDa Golgi precursor (p2) to the 61-kDa mature vacuolar form (m). When the sec12 mutant cells were pulse-labeled for 4 min and chased for 2 h at 37 °C, the p1 form accumulated, indicating that the ER-to-Golgi transport was blocked. Such accumulation of the p1 form was not detected when the sec12–4 rst2–1 double mutant cells were incubated at 37 °C. Normal modification and processing from p1 through p2 to m forms was observed, although the rate was a little slower than that of wild-type cells. We also performed a pulse-chase experiment on a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored plasma-membrane protein, Gas1p (14Schimmöller F. Singer-Krüger B. Schröder S. Krüger U. Barlowe C. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 15Doering T.L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, lower panel). Like the case of CPY, the immature form (i) of Gas1p accumulated in the sec12mutant cells after 30-min chase at 37 °C. In contrast, Gas1p was processed to the mature form (m) in the sec12–4 rst2–1double mutant cells at the restrictive temperature forsec12, 37 °C. These data indicate that therst2 mutation remedies the secretory defect of thesec12 mutation. Overproduction of the Sec12 ts protein by the introduction of the mutant gene on a multicopy plasmid (2μ) allows growth of thesec12 ts strain at 37 °C (Fig.2 A; see also Ref. 16d'Enfert C. Barlowe C. Nishikawa S. Nakano A. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5727-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Even a slight increase of the gene dosage by the introduction of the single-copy plasmid (CEN) of sec12 could suppress the ts growth to some extent. We performed immunoblotting analysis using the anti-Sec12p antibody to examine whether the level of Sec12–4p increased in the sec12 rst2 cells to the extent that was able to suppress the sec12 mutant phenotype. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the amount of Sec12–4p was slightly increased in the sec12–4 rst2–1 cells as compared with that in the sec12–4 RST2 cells (lanes 3 and 4 versus lanes 1 and 2). Careful quantification of the results of three independent experiments with the amount of Pgk1p as an internal standard indicated that the amount of Sec12–4p was 2–3 times larger in sec12–4 rst2–1 than in sec12–4 RST2. The extent of the increase was almost the same as the case where an extra copy of sec12–4 was supplied by the introduction of a single-copy (CEN) plasmid (lanes 5 and6). The level of Sar1p was not affected either by therst2–1 mutation or the introduction of sec12–4plasmids. These results suggested a possibility that the increase of Sec12–4p by the rst2–1 mutation was the cause of the suppression. However, the effects of the rst2–1 mutation and the increase of Sec12–4 were quite different when the intracellular transport of CPY was examined. As shown in thebottom panel of Fig. 2 B, the introduction of the rst2–1 mutation in sec12–4cells completely remedied the accumulation of the ER form (p1). In contrast, in the cells in which the Sec12–4 levels were raised bysec12–4 plasmids (CEN or 2μ), the accumulation of the p1 CPY was not completely cured even though the ts growth was almost completely suppressed by 2μ sec12–4. These observations led us to conclude that the effect of rst2–1in the suppression of sec12–4 was not due to the increase of the Sec12–4 protein by itself. For the cloning of the RST2 gene, STR2, the original cold-sensitive rst2–1 sec12 mutant strain, was transformed with a yeast genomic DNA library constructed on the multicopy plasmid YEp13 (10Yoshihisa T. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). DNA clones that rescued the cold-sensitive growth were selected. One clone named P2–3 showed good complementation and was analyzed further. The 6.7-kb insert of P2–3 contained two complete ORFs, HRR25 and TPK2/PKA3(see Fig. 3 A). To localize the complementation activity of rst2–1 in this insert, deletion analysis was performed. Various fragments from P2–3 were subcloned into a multicopy plasmid, pQR324, or a single-copy CENplasmid, pRS314, and introduced into the rst2–1 sec12–4mutant (STR2). Transformants were tested for growth at the restrictive temperature for rst2–1, 15 °C. As shown in Fig.3 A, DNA fragments always complemented the rst2mutant when they contained HRR25. The presence or absence ofTPK2 did not correlate with the complementation activity. The same results were obtained for both the multicopy and single-copy plasmids. Thus, it is the HRR25 gene that complementedrst2–1. STR2 cells show morphological abnormality as well (5Nakano A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The cells do not separate very well after division and tend to aggregate either in liquid or on plate culture. The DNA fragment containing HRR25 not only resumed the growth defect ofSTR2 at 15 and 23 °C (Fig. 3 B), it also remedied this aggregation phenotype (Fig. 3 C). To confirm that HRR25 is the authentic RST2 gene, the fragment containing HRR25 with the LEU2marker was integrated at the HRR25 locus in thesec12–4 mutant, MBY10–7C. The integrant was mated with STR2 which was transformed by pAM2–326, a URA3-marker multicopy plasmid containing HRR25 derived from pYO326. This plasmid complemented rst2–1 and dramatically improved the mating and sporulation efficiency of the mutant. The diploid cells were sporulated, and the progeny haploid cells were plated on MVD (complete supplement) containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) at 27 °C to remove pAM2–326. Among 160 spores analyzed, 67 spores showed Leu− Cs− phenotype, 90 spores were Leu+ Cs+, 1 was Leu+Cs−, and 2 were Leu− Cs+. This result indicated that the LEU2 marker was tightly linked to the Cs+ phenotype, namely HRR25 was linked to the rst2–1 locus. Therefore, we concluded thatRST2 is identical to HRR25. Finally, we renamed our mutant allele (rst2–1) of HRR25,hrr25–2. HRR25 encodes a dual-specificity casein kinase I (CKI) (17Hoekstra M.F. Liskay R.M. Ou A.C. DeMaggio A.J. Burbee D.G. Heffron F. Science. 1991; 253: 1031-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We isolated the mutant hrr25–2 gene by the allele recovery method and determined that it contained a mutation of the C527T replacement in the nucleotide sequence, which caused T176I mutation in the amino acid sequence (Fig.4 A). A comparison of the amino acid sequence of Hrr25p with other yeast CKIs is shown in Fig.4 B. The T176I mutation is in the region conserved in all members of the yeast CKI family. To examine whether hrr25–2is a kinase-minus (low kinase activity) or constitutively active mutation, we carried out an in vitro kinase assay for the Hrr25 protein from the wild-type and mutant cells (Fig.5). HA-tagged versions of theHRR25 and hrr25–2 genes were constructed for this purpose. 3HA-HRR25 complemented the mutant phenotypes of Δhrr25 and hrr25–2 (data not shown). The 3HA-tagged Hrr25p was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody and subjected to the kinase assay. The result of SDS-PAGE and autoradiography is shown in Fig. 5 B. By the incubation with [γ-32P]ATP, the immunoprecipitated 3HA-Hrr25p phosphorylated Hrr25p itself and casein as a substrate, but not histone H1 or myelin basic protein (lanes 2 and4–6). In clear contrast, virtually no phosphorylated bands were observed when 3HA-Hrr25–2p was immunoprecipitated (lane 3). The amounts of 3HA-Hrr25p and 3HA-Hrr25–2p in the immunoprecipitates were almost the same as examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5 A). Thus, we conclude thathrr25–2 is a mutation with a markedly reduced kinase activity.Figure 5In vitro kinase assay of the Hrr25 T176I and K38A mutant proteins. A, Δhrr25cells (AMY7–4B) expressing no-tagged HRR25, 3HA-taggedHRR25, 3HA-tagged hrr25–2 (T176I), and 3HA-tagged hrr25 K38A were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5). The immunoprecipitates were examined for the amount of HA-tagged Hrr25 protein by immunoblotting with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (16B12).B, a kinase assay was performed in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the phosphorylated products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As substrates, casein (lanes 1, 3, 4, and7), histone H1 (lane 5), and myelin basic protein (lane 6) were added to the assay solution. The mobilities of molecular weight markers are shown on theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furthermore, we constructed another mutant version of 3HA-taggedHRR25 (3HA-hrr25 K38A) by site-directed mutagenesis, which was also expected to be kinase-minus, and to act dominantly on the wild-type protein when overproduced. In the immunoprecipitation kinase assay (Fig. 5, lane 7), in fact, we could not detect any kinase activity of 3HA-Hrr25p K38A. As shown in Fig.6 A, the overproduction of Hrr25p K38A slightly suppressed the growth defect ofsec12–4 at 35 °C. On the other hand, it inhibited the growth of sec23–1 and sar1–2 at 30 and 33 °C, respectively, and that of the wild-type slightly at 35 °C. A HRR25disruption was generated by inserting the 1.8-kb BamHI fragment of HIS3 from pJJ215 into theAflII-NdeI sites of HRR25. This disrupted gene was introduced on an integration vector into the wild-type diploid, YPH501. The resulting heterozygous diploid was sporulated and subjected to tetrad dissection. Fast and slow growing spores segregated 2:2. All the slow growth spores showed His+ phenotype. The correct integration at theHRR25 locus was confirmed by Southern blotting (data not shown). This indicates that these slow growing spores were the Δhrr25 mutant. This observation is consistent with the results of Hoekstra et al. (17Hoekstra M.F. Liskay R.M. Ou A.C. DeMaggio A.J. Burbee D.G. Heffron F. Science. 1991; 253: 1031-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), i.e. HRR25 is not essential but very important for cell viability. Δhrr25 showed extremely slow growth at low (15 °C) and high (37 °C) temperatures. If the suppression of sec12–4 by hrr25–2 was due to the reduction of the Hrr25p kinase activity, the disruption ofHRR25 would also suppress the sec12–4 growth defect. To test this, the Δhrr25 mutant cells harboring pAM2–326 (2μ HRR25 URA3) were mated with thesec12–4 mutant (MBY10–7C). This diploid was sporulated, and tetrads were dissected to obtain segregants of the genotype, Δhrr25 sec12–4. The spores showed a 2:2 segregation pattern regarding the sec12–4 phenotype as marked by growth Ts− on MCD (−Ura) plates. If these spores were cultured on FOA-containing plates at 15 °C, they also showed a 2:2 segregation pattern, because Δhrr25 cells were extremely slow in growth at low temperature (15 °C). We selected segregants that are Ts− on MCD (−Ura) and Cs− on FOA plates, which have the genotype of Δhrr25 sec12–4. The segregants were grown on FOA plates at 27 °C to lose theHRR25 plasmid and examined for growth at high temperatures. As shown in Table I, they were all unable to grow on YPD plates at either 35 or 37 °C. This result indicates that Δhrr25 cannot suppress the sec12 mutation and suggests that hrr25–2 is not a null mutation in terms of the sec12 suppression. We also constructed double mutants of hrr25–2 with sec13–1, sec23–1, and ret1–1, but no clear suppression was observed.Table IAnalysis of segregants from Δhrr25 × sec12–4GenotypeGrowth at 35 and 37 °C−+Δhrr25 sec12–4290Δhrr25 SEC12330HRR25 sec12–4340HRR25 SEC12028 Open table in a new tab To further analyze the relationship between the kinase activity and thesec12 suppression, the two mutant alleles ofHRR25, hrr25 K38A and hrr25 T176I, were expressed in the Δhrr25 sec12–4 double mutant cells. As shown in Fig. 6 B, Δhrr25 sec12–4 hardly grew at 35 °C. The mutant cells expressing HRR25 did not grow at 35 °C, either, due to the sec12–4 mutation. However, the expression of hrr25 K38A or hrr25T176I suppressed the growth defect at 35 °C at least to some extent. In this paper, we have shown evidence for the first time that Hrr25p, a yeast CKI, is involved in vesicle budding from the endoplasmic reticulum. CKI is an expanding family of kinases, which have been proposed to play a variety of roles in many cellular processes. Among five defined isoforms of mammalian CKI (18Rowels J. Slaughter C. Moomaw C.

The replication properties of CTG·CAG, CGG·CCG, and TTC·GAA repeats were studied inEscherichia coli using an in vivo phagemid system as a model for continuous leading strand synthesis. The repeats were substantially deleted when the CTG, CGG, and GAA repeats were the templates for rolling circle replication from the f1 phage origin. The deletions may be mediated by hairpins formed by these repeat tracts. The distributions of the deletion products of the CTG·CAG and CGG·CCG tracts indicated that hairpins of discrete sizes mediate deletions during complementary strand synthesis. Deletions during rolling circle synthesis are caused by larger hairpins of specific sizes. Thus, most deletion products were of defined lengths, suggesting a preference for specific hairpin intermediates. Small expansions of the CTG·CAG and CGG·CCG repeats were also observed, presumably due to the formation of CTG and CGG hairpins on the nascent complementary strand. Since rolling circle replication has been established in vitro as a model for leading strand synthesis, we conclude that triplet repeat instability can also occur on the leading strand of DNA replication.

The genetic instability of three triplet repeat sequences (TRS), 1The abbreviations used are: TRS, triplet repeat sequence(s); UTR, untranslated region; SSB, single-stranded DNA binding protein; RF, replicative form; bp, base pair(s). CTG·CAG, CGG·CCG, and TTC·GAA, has been shown to result in approximately 12 hereditary neurological diseases (2La Spada A.R.

These diseases are inherited in a non-Mendelian fashion by a phenomenon called “anticipation,” which is characterized by an increase in severity and a decrease in age of onset from one generation to the next. The anomalous expansion of TRS has been identified as the molecular basis for anticipation (1). Triplet repeat tracts are highly polymorphic and have been shown to range from five to approximately 40 repeats in normal human chromosomes. Expansion of these tracts can result in type I and type II diseases as classified by Paulson and Fischbeck (3Paulson H.L. Fischbeck K.H. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 79-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Whereas type I diseases are characterized by modestly expanded TRS (approximately 30–80 repeats) in the coding region of a gene, type II diseases contain massive expansions (>1000 repeats) of the triplet repeat tract in the 5′-UTR or 3′-UTR or in an intron of a gene (1, 3Paulson H.L. Fischbeck K.H. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 79-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli has been used as a genetically tractable system for the study of TRS in vivo (8Bacolla A. Bowater R.P. Wells R.D. Wells R.D. Warren S.T. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 467-484Google Scholar). The genetic instability of TRS in E. coli is dependent on its orientation relative to the unidirectional ColE1 origin of replication as well as host cell growth phase and transcription (9Kang S.

The effect of the orientation of the TRS with respect to the direction of replication on its instability was also demonstrated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (16Freudenreich C.H. Stavenhagen J.B. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17Miret J.J. Pessoabrandao L. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell.

Single-stranded phage replication from the filamentous f1 and M13 viral origins was characterized both in vitro and in vivo (19Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed.

Micro. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 442-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In these phages, the unidirectional synthesis of the Watson and the Crick strands of the DNA takes place by different mechanisms. First, the single-stranded (+)-strands are converted to the double-stranded replicative form (RF) by complementary strand synthesis. Second, the RF is replicated by a rolling circle mechanism to yield (+)-strands. Remarkably, both steps occur by continuous strand synthesis and are marked by the absence of discontinuous Okazaki fragments. Therefore, due to the absence of any step analogous to lagging strand synthesis, rolling circle replication has been exploited in in vitro replication studies as a model to simulate the synthesis of the leading strand (22Marians K.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12220-12225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We proposed (9Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) that the in vivo expansion and deletion of the CTG·CAG repeats is mediated by hairpin formation by the CTG repeats on the lagging strand during DNA replication. This model was based on two findings. First, single-stranded TRS have been shown (24Mariappan S.V.S. Chen X. Catasti P. Bradbury E.M. Gupta G. Wells R.D. Warren S.T. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 647-676Google Scholar, 25Mitas M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2875-2878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) to adopt compact secondary structures in vitro (see below). Second, replication-dependent deletions between direct repeats occur due to secondary structure formation preferentially on the discontinuous lagging strand (29Trinh T.Q. Sinden R.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), because the lagging strand template is more likely to transiently be in a single-stranded state compared with the leading strand. However, the role of the leading strand in deletion formation has not been well studied. Kang et al. (9Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) could not distinguish between TRS instabilities on the leading strand from those on the lagging strand, because the two strands are synthesized concurrently in the ColE1 replication system. Therefore, we utilized the filamentous phagemid system (30Messing J. Vieira J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) to dissect the replication fork and focus on the continuous leading strand synthesis of TRS in vivo.

Short single-stranded tracts containing CTG repeats have a higher propensity to form hairpin structures than similar tracts containing the complementary CAG repeats (33Zheng M. Huang X. Smith G.K.

Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The ability of the CGG repeats to form secondary structures in vitro also differs significantly from the complementary CCG repeats (25Mitas M.

However, there is not a consensus in the literature regarding the relative stabilities of the structures formed by the CCG and the CGG repeats. The secondary structures formed by the TRS tracts have been shown to impede the progression of DNA polymerasesin vitro (39Usdin K. Woodford K.J.

Genet. 1997; 17: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Herein, we show that instability of the CTG·CAG repeats in anin vivo single-stranded phage replication system depends on the orientation of the repeats with respect to the f1 replication origin. Substantial deletions were observed when the CTG repeats that are prone to form hairpins are present in the template for rolling circle replication. Because f1 replication is characterized by the absence of a discontinuous lagging strand, our data show that deletion of TRS tracts can occur on the leading strand of DNA replication inE. coli. We also observe expansion of CGG·CCG and CTG·CAG repeats during complementary strand synthesis in vivo. E. coli host strain NM522 (F′ lac I q Δ(lacZ) M15 proA + B + /supE thi Δ(lac-proAB) Δ(hsdMS-mcrB)5(rk−mk−McrBC−)) and helper phage M13K07 (KanR) were purchased from Promega Corp. E. coli NM522 is proficient for homologous recombination. The phagemid cloning vectors pGEM3Zf+ and pGEM3Zf− (3199 bp), which carry the f1 origin of replication in addition to the ColE1 origin, were purchased from Promega Corp. The f1 origin is in opposite orientations in pGEM3Zf+ and pGEM3Zf−. Sequencing of single and double-stranded DNA was done using either the T7 promoter primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) or the SP6 promoter primer (5′-TATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′) purchased from Promega Corp. Southern hybridization was done using a CTG repeat containing probe 5′-GATA(CTG)15-3′ (Gene Technologies Laboratory, Texas A & M University). Fragments containing CGG·CCG and CTG·CAG TRS were prepared from previously described plasmids (9Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat.

Fragments containing TTC·GAA triplet repeats were generated by digesting pRW3804 withEcoRI and PstI (New England Biolabs Inc.). The digested DNA was electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel, and the band containing the triplet repeat fragment was excised. The DNA was eluted from the excised band and purified by phenol extraction. The vector was prepared by digesting pGEM3Zf+ and pGEM3Zf− with eitherHindIII and SacI or EcoRI andPstI. The linearized vector was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and the DNA eluted from the excised band. The vector DNA was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim). The insert and vector were mixed and ligated for 16 h at 16 °C by the addition of 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli NM522 by electroporation. Plasmid DNA was isolated from individual transformants by standard alkaline lysis procedures. The DNA was characterized by restriction mapping and dideoxy chain termination sequencing of the insert in both strands.

The insert was then electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel, excised, and eluted as described above. The vector was prepared by digesting pGEM3Zf+ and pGEM3Zf− with EcoRI and BspMI, followed by filling in the cohesive ends as described above. The linearized, blunt ended vector was purified by elution from a 1% agarose gel. The vector and insert were mixed and ligated by the addition of 10 units of T4 DNA ligase for 16 h at 16 °C. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli NM522 by electroporation. Plasmid DNA was isolated from individual transformants and characterized by restriction mapping and sequencing of both insert strands. E. coli NM522 was transformed with the appropriate plasmid by electroporation and plated on LB Agar plates (1% bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, 1.5% agar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Single transformant colonies were inoculated into 10 ml of LB (1% bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl) and grown at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. When the cells had grown to an absorbance (600 nm) of 0.2 units, the tubes were inoculated with helper phage M13K07 at a concentration of 1 × 108plaque-forming units/ml. The cells were further grown at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 2 h. The cultures were then inoculated into flasks containing 1 liter of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μg/ml kanamycin (for maintenance of M13K07) and grown at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 12 h. The cultures were centrifuged in a Sorvall RC3Bplus centrifuge at 2500 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant containing the packaged phagemids was collected. The single-stranded phagemid DNA was isolated and purified from the packaged phagemids according to previously described procedures (49Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNA was then characterized by standard dideoxy chain termination sequencing (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Control cultures of E. coli NM522 uninfected by M13K07 were unable to grow in the presence of 100 μg/ml kanamycin, thus validating the use of kanamycin selection for the continued presence of M13K07. Phagemids containing undeleted TRS tracts were prepared as described previously (10Bowater R.P. Rosche W.A. Jaworski A. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and transformed into competent E. coli NM522 cells, which were preinfected with M13K07 helper phage and maintained by kanamycin selection. The transformation mixture was inoculated into 10-ml LB tubes (containing ampicillin and kanamycin, both at 100 μg/ml) at a cell density of 103 cells/ml. The cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. When the cultures reached an absorbance (600 nm) of 1.0 unit (20–24 h), an aliquot was inoculated into a fresh tube of 10 ml LB (with kanamycin and ampicillin as before) at a final dilution of 1 × 10−7. The original culture was harvested, and double-stranded RF DNA was isolated by standard alkaline lysis procedures (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). The cultures were thus maintained in log phase growth by repeated recultivation (defined in the figure legends as number of recultivations). The phagemid RF DNA from the harvested cells was analyzed for the stability of its triplet repeat tract. Since the phagemid life cycle involves the formation of the RF from the (+)-strand, we assume that this analysis is an accurate measure of the stability of the triplet repeat tract in the (+)-strand. However, we cannot exclude the formal possibility that aberrant DNA molecules are produced that are not amplified by plasmid replication and hence are not detected. The triplet repeat insert was excised from the phagemids with EcoRI and HindIII and analyzed as follows. In order to identify the deletion products, Southern hybridization was performed on pRW3711 and pRW3712 digested withEcoRI and HindIII and separated on 1.5% agarose gels. The gels were blotted by standard procedures (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) and probed with a CTG-containing oligonucleotide that was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase under conditions of medium stringency (50% formamide, 50 °C for 6 h). The blots were washed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The extent of triplet repeat instability was determined by measuring the relative amount of undeleted triplet repeat insert in the phagemids after replication in the presence of M13K07. TheEcoRI–HindIII-digested DNA was labeled by end filling with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP. The labeled DNA was separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels, which were dried and exposed to a phosphorescence-sensitive screen. The instability was quantitated by scanning the exposed screen with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The amount of radioactivity (as estimated by the signal intensity) in the band corresponding to the full-length TRS was measured as a proportion of the total radioactivity in the lane below the band. In vivo growth of plasmids containing CTG·CAG triplet repeats in E. coli has revealed the involvement of DNA replication in the instabilities associated with these sequences (9Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that expansions and deletions occur due to formation of hairpin structures by CTG repeats on the lagging strand template (28Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2875-2878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This was based on the earlier finding that the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand increases its probability of existing in a single-stranded state relative to the leading strand template, thereby resulting in preferential mutagenesis of the lagging strand (29Trinh T.Q. Sinden R.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The replication of these sequences in a system where leading and lagging strands can be dissected would therefore be an attractive way to test this hypothesis. Mechanistically, the replication from the filamentous phage f1 origin can be distinguished into two stages (19Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar, 20Denhardt D.T. Dressler D. Ray D.S. The Single Stranded DNA Phages. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978Google Scholar, 21Khan S.A. Micro. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 442-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). First, the single-stranded (+)-strand template is converted to double-stranded RF by a continuous complementary strand synthesis step. Second, the double-stranded RF is replicated via a rolling circle replication step to yield single-stranded (+)-strands. The rolling circle replication is also continuous and is analogous to leading strand synthesis (22Marians K.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12220-12225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of a discontinuous strand synthesis step involving Okazaki fragments is a characteristic feature of replication from the f1 origin (51Baas P.D. Jansz H.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 136: 31-69PubMed Google Scholar). In order to delineate the instabilities that occur due to the formation of hairpin structures during rolling circle replication (and therefore, by extension, during leading strand synthesis) from those that occur due to similar structures during complementary strand synthesis, we established an in vivo phagemid replication system for TRS. The phagemids pGEM3Zf+ and pGEM3Zf− were used, which carry the origin of replication from the filamentous phage f1 oriented oppositely in the two phagemids. This facilitates the replication of the top strand by pGEM3Zf− and the bottom strand by"

We have used scanning cysteine mutagenesis and sulfhydryl-specific chemistry to identify pore-lining residues in the Ser643–Ser690 region of the protein. The Ser643–Ser690 region spans transmembrane segment 8 of AE1 and surrounds Glu681, which may reside at the transmembrane permeability barrier. Glu681 also directly interacts with some anions during anion transport. The introduced cysteine mutants were expressed by transient transfection of HEK293 cells. Anion exchange activity was assessed by measurement of changes of intracellular pH, which follow transmembrane bicarbonate movement mediated by AE1. To identify residues that might form part of an aqueous transmembrane pore, we measured anion exchange activity of each introduced cysteine mutant before and after incubation with the sulfhydryl reagentspara-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate and 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide. Our data identified transmembrane mutants A666C, S667C, L669C, L673C, L677C, and L680C and intracellular mutants I684C and I688C that could be inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents and may therefore form a part of a transmembrane pore. These residues map to one face of a helical wheel plot. The ability to inhibit two intracellular mutants suggests that transmembrane helix 8 extends at least two helical turns beyond the intracellular membrane surface. The identified hydrophobic pore-lining residues (leucine, isoleucine, and alanine) may limit interactions with substrate anions.

The ability to inhibit two intracellular mutants suggests that transmembrane helix 8 extends at least two helical turns beyond the intracellular membrane surface. The identified hydrophobic pore-lining residues (leucine, isoleucine, and alanine) may limit interactions with substrate anions. AE1, also called Band 3, is the plasma membrane chloride bicarbonate anion exchange protein of the erythrocyte (1Kopito R.R. Lodish H.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and kidney (2Brosius III, F.C. Alper S.L. Garcia A.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Cytol. 1990; 123: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); AE2 is most broadly expressed in tissues such as gastric parietal cells (4Jöns T. Warrings B. Jöns A. Drenckhahn D.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6266-6279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the anion exchangers have a two-domain structure: a 55-kDa membrane domain responsible for anion exchange and a 43–77-kDa cytoplasmic domain involved in cytoskeletal interactions. Membrane domains are highly conserved (80% homology in the whole domain and close to 90% in the transmembrane segments). All anion exchangers function by an electroneutral “Ping-Pong” mechanism of Cl−/HCO3− exchange. The high abundance of AE1 in the erythrocyte membrane (50% of integral protein (9Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6158) Google Scholar)) has made the protein a model for the study of transport protein structure and function (10Reithmeier R.A.F. Chan S.L.

On the basis of indirect evidence, Passow has proposed a model for anion translocation that involves residues from TMs 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment; AE1C−, cysteineless AE1; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-(5 and 6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester; biotin maleimide, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; MTSEA, 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate, hydrobromide; pCMBS, para-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator.1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment; AE1C−, cysteineless AE1; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-(5 and 6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester; biotin maleimide, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; MTSEA, 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate, hydrobromide; pCMBS, para-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator. 5, 8, 10, 12, and 13, including mouse residues Glu472, Glu535, Lys539, Glu681, His703, Arg731, His735, His816, and His834 (12Müller-Berger S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 1691-1697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have strong evidence to implicate the TM8 residue, Glu681, in the transport process, since labeling this residue with Woodward's reagent K and reduction with sodium borohydride resulted in altered anion exchange kinetics. The functional role of Glu681 in AE1 was confirmed in mutagenesis experiments of mouse AE1 (16Chernova M.N. Jiang L. Crest M. Hand M. Vandorpe D.H. Strange K. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and extended to the homologous position of mouse AE2, suggesting that the mechanistic role of Glu681 is conserved among anion exchange proteins (17Sekler I. Lo R.S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28751-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Woodward's reagent K chemical modification of AE1 abolishes chloride transport, yet relieves the requirement for proton cotransport during sulfate transport. During sulfate transport in unmodified AE1, a proton, supplied by Glu681 is cotransported. Sulfate/proton cotransport takes place in both inward and outward directions, which implies that Glu681 has access to both the intracellular and extracellular sides of the membrane. Taken together, Glu681 is functionally involved in anion exchange events and may reside at the permeability barrier of AE1.Glu681 of TM8 is the best characterized residue that interacts with anions during translocation event. We have therefore focused on TM8 in efforts to identify residues involved in anion translocation. In a previous report we analyzed a panel of introduced cysteine residues spanning the TM8 region from Ser643 to Ser690. Using accessibility to chemical modification by 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin and lucifer yellow iodoacetamide we identified the bilayer spanning residues as the sequence Met664–Gln683 (18Tang X.-B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Substituted cysteine mutagenesis and sulfhydryl chemistry have proved a fruitful approach to identify residues of the transport pathway. The method is to mutate all native cysteine residues in a protein and to systematically re-introduce unique cysteine residues into the cysteineless background. Inhibition of anion transport by sulfhydryl-specific reagents is then assessed for each mutant. The approach has been useful for studies of the bacterial transport proteins, lactose permease (19He M.M. Sun J. Kaback H.R.

Differential sensitivity to inhibition by methanethiosulfonate compounds has also identified residues of the transport pathway in the glutamate transport protein GLT-1 (29Zarbiv R. Grunewald M.

Previously we constructed a cysteineless form of human AE1, called AE1C−, and characterized the protein as fully functional (32Casey J.R. Ding Y. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have systematically replaced the residues of AE1 from the glycosylation site at Asn642 through TM8 into the cytoplasmic region and identified the sequence Met664–Gln683 as spanning the bilayer (18Tang X.-B. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this report we measure the effect of two sulfhydryl reagents upon AE1 anion transport function, using BCECF fluorescence to monitor intracellular pH shifts associated with Cl−/HCO3− exchange in transfected HEK293 cells. Of the two sulfhydryl reagents, pCMBS is membrane-impermeant but slowly transported by AE1, while MTSEA is membrane-permeant in its unprotonated form (33Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We have identified a sequence of leucine, isoleucine, and alanine residues that lie on one face of an α-helix and, when mutated to cysteine, are susceptible to inhibition by pCMBS and MTSEA.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we have examined the amino acid sequence from SER643–SER690 of human AE1, to identify residues that line a transmembrane anion translocation pore. We have focused on this region because it contains Glu681, shown previously to be accessible to membrane impermeant Woodward's reagent K, from either side of the membrane (13Jennings M.L. Al-Rhaiyel S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Jennings M.L. Smith J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13964-13971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jennings M.L. Anderson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1691-1697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This residue may therefore reside at the transmembrane permeability barrier. Because Glu681 is accessible to Woodward's reagent K and has been implicated as one residue that interacts with anions, at least during sulfate transport, we decided to examine the region surrounding Glu681 to find other residues that might form the anion translocation channel. We recently determined the topology of the Ser643–Ser690 region and localized Glu681 to within four residues of the cytosolic surface of the protein (18Tang X.-B. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Our results have identified a sequence of introduced cysteine mutants (Ala666, Ser667, Leu669, Leu673, Leu677, Leu680, Ile684, and Ile688) in the transmembrane segment 8 region of human AE1 that can be inhibited either by the sulfhydryl reagents pCMBS or MTSEA. The locations of the mutants have a helical periodicity and reside on one face of a predicted α-helix, which extends at least one turn beyond the surface of the membrane. Seven of the eight identified residues are found within a 100° arc of a TM8 helical wheel plot, indicating that the region forms an α-helix. The sensitive helical face is directly opposite the most hydrophobic face of TM8 and is adjacent to Glu681, which was shown previously to interact with anions during transmembrane translocation. The simplest explanation for our data is a covalent interaction of introduced cysteine residues with the sulfhydryl compounds; at sites that line the pore, these reagents block the pore and inhibit anion transport. On this basis we propose that Ala666, Ser667, Leu669, Leu673, Leu677, Leu680, Ile684, and Ile688 line the transmembrane translocation channel and interact with substrate anions as they cross the bilayer. An alternate possibility is that the inhibited residues form a conformationally active surface of AE1, part of a cleft where two helices meet and whose movements are blocked by sulfhydryl modification. However, this model is unlikely since such a cleft would not be likely to have access to pCMBS and MTSEA, two hydrophilic reagents.Our observation that the hydrophobic amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and alanine line the TM8 portion of the anion translocation channel at first seems surprising. The alkyl side chains of these amino acids are not hydrophilic and cannot contribute hydrogen bonds to line an aqueous channel. However, hydrophobic residues have been found to form part of the lining of the cystic fibrosis chloride channel, CFTR (23Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Cook T.A. Archdeacon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14865-14868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor channel (26Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21505-21508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the acetylcholine receptor Na+ channel (28Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The transmembrane carbohydrate translocation channel of the maltoporin protein is lined with hydrophobic residues (44Dutzler R. Wang Y.F. Rizkallah P. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Similarly, the crystal structure of a bacterial K+ channel illustrated that the ion translocation pore is lined with hydrophobic amino acids (45Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5686) Google Scholar). The authors speculated that the hydrophobic lining provides the most energetically favorable surface for movement of ions. Interactions with the wall of the pore would only impede ion transit through the pore. A hydrophobic lining of the AE1 anion translocation pore could be important to facilitate the high turnover rate (105 anions·s−1 (46Jay D. Cantley L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 511-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)), which is an order of magnitude slower than ion channel fluxes, but still very fast. The observation that the pore-lining face of the helix is not centered on Glu681 may also seem surprising, because Glu681 interacts with sulfate anions during transport (13Jennings M.L. Al-Rhaiyel S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Jennings M.L. Smith J.S. J. Biol.

However, Glu681 is on the edge of the pore in our model (Fig. 6) and could extend its side chain into the pore. Interestingly, Passow has presented a model of the AE1 anion translocation pathway in which TM8 interacts with TM9 and TM10, but E681 is predicted to be on the edge of the pore (12Müller-Berger S. Karbach D. Konig J. Lepke S. Wood P.G. Appelhans H. Passow H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9315-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Mutant S667C stands apart from the other sulfhydryl reagent-sensitive sites. This is the only hydrophilic site observed among the pore-lining residues. All other sites cluster on one face of the helix, while S667C is 60° removed from the rest of the mutants, on a helical wheel plot. S667C is close to Pro670, which may kink and twist the TM8 helix. This would result in exposure of a discontinuous helical face to line the pore. That is the TM8 helical region above and below Pro680 may not be directly aligned.Our results may provide insight into the structure of the anion translocation pore. We observed that AE1 introduced cysteine mutants are only partially (<40%) inhibited by pCMBS. Similarly, in studies of the CFTR chloride channel, pCMBS was only able to inhibit to 25–75% (24Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast translocation pathway mutants of the bacterial glucose 6-phosphate transporter, UhpT, were nearly fully inhibited by pCMBS (22Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This difference in sensitivity to pCMBS may reflect the size of the anion translocation pore, since glucose 6-phosphate is larger than chloride. The CFTR channel is estimated to have a pore diameter of at least 6 Å (24Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which provides at least an approximation for the size of the AE1 pore.One prevailing model of AE1 suggests that the anion translocation pore forms an outward facing funnel and narrows to a permeability barrier at Glu681 (47Jennings M.L. Hamasaki N. Jennings M.L. Anion Transport Protein of the Red Blood Cell Membrane. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1989: 59-72Google Scholar). Our data may provide some support for the model. The first sulfhydryl reagent-sensitive site (Ala666) is located after the start of the TM8 (Met664) (18Tang X.-B. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since both pCMBS and MTSEA are expected to inhibit anion exchange by steric blockage of a pore, the observation that the inner portion of TM8 is more sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents than the outer suggests a more open outer region and a more closed pore in the inner region. In line with this model, we found that L669C was sensitive to pCMBS, but not MTSEA, reflecting the larger steric bulk of pCMBS. Furthermore, A666C and S667C, the outermost sensitive mutants, both had lower pCMBS sensitivity than the inner mutants. We found that the sequence of pCMBS-inhibited residues ended at Leu680, which is consistent with the identification of Glu681 as the site of the permeability barrier. Since pCMBS can permeate the membrane only via AE1, it will not accumulate on the cytosolic surface to any extent. Conversely, MTSEA is membrane permeant in its deprotonated form (33Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and therefore can access the anion translocation pore from both the extracellular and intracellular surfaces. Finally, our data show that the greatest sensitivity to pCMBS is found with mutant L680C, which is adjacent to Glu681, the presumed permeability barrier. The high sensitivity at this site may reflect a smaller pore diameter. AE1, also called Band 3, is the plasma membrane chloride bicarbonate anion exchange protein of the erythrocyte (1Kopito R.R. Lodish H.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and kidney (2Brosius III, F.C. Alper S.L. Garcia A.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7784-7787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AE1 is a member of a multigene family (3Kopito R.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 123: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); AE2 is most broadly expressed in tissues such as gastric parietal cells (4Jöns T. Warrings B. Jöns A. Drenckhahn D. Histochemistry. 1994; 102: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and choroid plexus (5Lindsey A.E. Schneider K. Simmons D.M. Baron R. Lee B.S. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6266-6279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the anion exchangers have a two-domain structure: a 55-kDa membrane domain responsible for anion exchange and a 43–77-kDa cytoplasmic domain involved in cytoskeletal interactions. Membrane domains are highly conserved (80% homology in the whole domain and close to 90% in the transmembrane segments). All anion exchangers function by an electroneutral “Ping-Pong” mechanism of Cl−/HCO3− exchange. The high abundance of AE1 in the erythrocyte membrane (50% of integral protein (9Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6158) Google Scholar)) has made the protein a model for the study of transport protein structure and function (10Reithmeier R.A.F. Chan S.L.

Several residues have been implicated as part of the anion exchange mechanism of AE1. On the basis of indirect evidence, Passow has proposed a model for anion translocation that involves residues from TMs 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment; AE1C−, cysteineless AE1; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-(5 and 6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester; biotin maleimide, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; MTSEA, 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate, hydrobromide; pCMBS, para-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator.1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment; AE1C−, cysteineless AE1; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-(5 and 6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester; biotin maleimide, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; MTSEA, 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate, hydrobromide; pCMBS, para-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator. 5, 8, 10, 12, and 13, including mouse residues Glu472, Glu535, Lys539, Glu681, His703, Arg731, His735, His816, and His834 (12Müller-Berger S. Karbach D. Konig J. Lepke S. Wood P.G. Appelhans H. Passow H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9315-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Jennings and co-workers (13Jennings M.L. Al-Rhaiyel S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Jennings M.L. Smith J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 1691-1697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have strong evidence to implicate the TM8 residue, Glu681, in the transport process, since labeling this residue with Woodward's reagent K and reduction with sodium borohydride resulted in altered anion exchange kinetics. The functional role of Glu681 in AE1 was confirmed in mutagenesis experiments of mouse AE1 (16Chernova M.N. Jiang L. Crest M. Hand M. Vandorpe D.H. Strange K. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and extended to the homologous position of mouse AE2, suggesting that the mechanistic role of Glu681 is conserved among anion exchange proteins (17Sekler I. Lo R.S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28751-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Woodward's reagent K chemical modification of AE1 abolishes chloride transport, yet relieves the requirement for proton cotransport during sulfate transport. During sulfate transport in unmodified AE1, a proton, supplied by Glu681 is cotransported. Sulfate/proton cotransport takes place in both inward and outward directions, which implies that Glu681 has access to both the intracellular and extracellular sides of the membrane. Taken together, Glu681 is functionally involved in anion exchange events and may reside at the permeability barrier of AE1. Glu681 of TM8 is the best characterized residue that interacts with anions during translocation event. We have therefore focused on TM8 in efforts to identify residues involved in anion translocation. In a previous report we analyzed a panel of introduced cysteine residues spanning the TM8 region from Ser643 to Ser690. Using accessibility to chemical modification by 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin and lucifer yellow iodoacetamide we identified the bilayer spanning residues as the sequence Met664–Gln683 (18Tang X.-B. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Substituted cysteine mutagenesis and sulfhydryl chemistry have proved a fruitful approach to identify residues of the transport pathway. The method is to mutate all native cysteine residues in a protein and to systematically re-introduce unique cysteine residues into the cysteineless background. Inhibition of anion transport by sulfhydryl-specific reagents is then assessed for each mutant. The approach has been useful for studies of the bacterial transport proteins, lactose permease (19He M.M. Sun J. Kaback H.R.

A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Among mammalian membrane proteins, this approach has proved very successful for ion channels.

Differential sensitivity to inhibition by methanethiosulfonate compounds has also identified residues of the transport pathway in the glutamate transport protein GLT-1 (29Zarbiv R. Grunewald M.

We used substituted cysteine mutagenesis and sulfhydryl chemistry to identify pore-lining residues in the TM8 region of human AE1 chloride/bicarbonate exchange protein. Previously we constructed a cysteineless form of human AE1, called AE1C−, and characterized the protein as fully functional (32Casey J.R. Ding Y. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have systematically replaced the residues of AE1 from the glycosylation site at Asn642 through TM8 into the cytoplasmic region and identified the sequence Met664–Gln683 as spanning the bilayer (18Tang X.-B. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this report we measure the effect of two sulfhydryl reagents upon AE1 anion transport function, using BCECF fluorescence to monitor intracellular pH shifts associated with Cl−/HCO3− exchange in transfected HEK293 cells. Of the two sulfhydryl reagents, pCMBS is membrane-impermeant but slowly transported by AE1, while MTSEA is membrane-permeant in its unprotonated form (33Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We have identified a sequence of leucine, isoleucine, and alanine residues that lie on one face of an α-helix and, when mutated to cysteine, are susceptible to inhibition by pCMBS and MTSEA. DISCUSSIONIn this paper we have examined the amino acid sequence from SER643–SER690 of human AE1, to identify residues that line a transmembrane anion translocation pore. We have focused on this region because it contains Glu681, shown previously to be accessible to membrane impermeant Woodward's reagent K, from either side of the membrane (13Jennings M.L. Al-Rhaiyel S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Jennings M.L. Smith J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13964-13971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jennings M.L. Anderson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1691-1697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This residue may therefore reside at the transmembrane permeability barrier. Because Glu681 is accessible to Woodward's reagent K and has been implicated as one residue that interacts with anions, at least during sulfate transport, we decided to examine the region surrounding Glu681 to find other residues that might form the anion translocation channel. We recently determined the topology of the Ser643–Ser690 region and localized Glu681 to within four residues of the cytosolic surface of the protein (18Tang X.-B. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Our results have identified a sequence of introduced cysteine mutants (Ala666, Ser667, Leu669, Leu673, Leu677, Leu680, Ile684, and Ile688) in the transmembrane segment 8 region of human AE1 that can be inhibited either by the sulfhydryl reagents pCMBS or MTSEA. The locations of the mutants have a helical periodicity and reside on one face of a predicted α-helix, which extends at least one turn beyond the surface of the membrane. Seven of the eight identified residues are found within a 100° arc of a TM8 helical wheel plot, indicating that the region forms an α-helix. The sensitive helical face is directly opposite the most hydrophobic face of TM8 and is adjacent to Glu681, which was shown previously to interact with anions during transmembrane translocation. The simplest explanation for our data is a covalent interaction of introduced cysteine residues with the sulfhydryl compounds; at sites that line the pore, these reagents block the pore and inhibit anion transport. On this basis we propose that Ala666, Ser667, Leu669, Leu673, Leu677, Leu680, Ile684, and Ile688 line the transmembrane translocation channel and interact with substrate anions as they cross the bilayer. An alternate possibility is that the inhibited residues form a conformationally active surface of AE1, part of a cleft where two helices meet and whose movements are blocked by sulfhydryl modification. However, this model is unlikely since such a cleft would not be likely to have access to pCMBS and MTSEA, two hydrophilic reagents.Our observation that the hydrophobic amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and alanine line the TM8 portion of the anion translocation channel at first seems surprising. The alkyl side chains of these amino acids are not hydrophilic and cannot contribute hydrogen bonds to line an aqueous channel. However, hydrophobic residues have been found to form part of the lining of the cystic fibrosis chloride channel, CFTR (23Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Cook T.A. Archdeacon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14865-14868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor channel (26Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21505-21508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the acetylcholine receptor Na+ channel (28Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The transmembrane carbohydrate translocation channel of the maltoporin protein is lined with hydrophobic residues (44Dutzler R. Wang Y.F. Rizkallah P. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Similarly, the crystal structure of a bacterial K+ channel illustrated that the ion translocation pore is lined with hydrophobic amino acids (45Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5686) Google Scholar). The authors speculated that the hydrophobic lining provides the most energetically favorable surface for movement of ions. Interactions with the wall of the pore would only impede ion transit through the pore. A hydrophobic lining of the AE1 anion translocation pore could be important to facilitate the high turnover rate (105 anions·s−1 (46Jay D. Cantley L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 511-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)), which is an order of magnitude slower than ion channel fluxes, but still very fast. The observation that the pore-lining face of the helix is not centered on Glu681 may also seem surprising, because Glu681 interacts with sulfate anions during transport (13Jennings M.L. Al-Rhaiyel S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Jennings M.L. Smith J.S. J. Biol.

However, Glu681 is on the edge of the pore in our model (Fig. 6) and could extend its side chain into the pore.

This difference in sensitivity to pCMBS may reflect the size of the anion translocation pore, since glucose 6-phosphate is larger than chloride. The CFTR channel is estimated to have a pore diameter of at least 6 Å (24Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys.

J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor channel (26Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21505-21508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the acetylcholine receptor Na+ channel (28Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The transmembrane carbohydrate translocation channel of the maltoporin protein is lined with hydrophobic residues (44Dutzler R. Wang Y.F. Rizkallah P. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Similarly, the crystal structure of a bacterial K+ channel illustrated that the ion translocation pore is lined with hydrophobic amino acids (45Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5686) Google Scholar). The authors speculated that the hydrophobic lining provides the most energetically favorable surface for movement of ions. Interactions with the wall of the pore would only impede ion transit through the pore. A hydrophobic lining of the AE1 anion translocation pore could be important to facilitate the high turnover rate (105 anions·s−1 (46Jay D. Cantley L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 511-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)), which is an order of magnitude slower than ion channel fluxes, but still very fast. The observation that the pore-lining face of the helix is not centered on Glu681 may also seem surprising, because Glu681 interacts with sulfate anions during transport (13Jennings M.L. Al-Rhaiyel S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Jennings M.L. Smith J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13964-13971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jennings M.L. Anderson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1691-1697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Glu681 is on the edge of the pore in our model (Fig. 6) and could extend its side chain into the pore. Interestingly, Passow has presented a model of the AE1 anion translocation pathway in which TM8 interacts with TM9 and TM10, but E681 is predicted to be on the edge of the pore (12Müller-Berger S. Karbach D. Konig J. Lepke S. Wood P.G. Appelhans H. Passow H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9315-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mutant S667C stands apart from the other sulfhydryl reagent-sensitive sites. This is the only hydrophilic site observed among the pore-lining residues. All other sites cluster on one face of the helix, while S667C is 60° removed from the rest of the mutants, on a helical wheel plot. S667C is close to Pro670, which may kink and twist the TM8 helix. This would result in exposure of a discontinuous helical face to line the pore. That is the TM8 helical region above and below Pro680 may not be directly aligned. Our results may provide insight into the structure of the anion translocation pore. We observed that AE1 introduced cysteine mutants are only partially (<40%) inhibited by pCMBS. Similarly, in studies of the CFTR chloride channel, pCMBS was only able to inhibit to 25–75% (24Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast translocation pathway mutants of the bacterial glucose 6-phosphate transporter, UhpT, were nearly fully inhibited by pCMBS (22Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This difference in sensitivity to pCMBS may reflect the size of the anion translocation pore, since glucose 6-phosphate is larger than chloride. The CFTR channel is estimated to have a pore diameter of at least 6 Å (24Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which provides at least an approximation for the size of the AE1 pore. One prevailing model of AE1 suggests that the anion translocation pore forms an outward facing funnel and narrows to a permeability barrier at Glu681 (47Jennings M.L. Hamasaki N. Jennings M.L. Anion Transport Protein of the Red Blood Cell Membrane. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1989: 59-72Google Scholar). Our data may provide some support for the model. The first sulfhydryl reagent-sensitive site (Ala666) is located after the start of the TM8 (Met664) (18Tang X.-B. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since both pCMBS and MTSEA are expected to inhibit anion exchange by steric blockage of a pore, the observation that the inner portion of TM8 is more sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents than the outer suggests a more open outer region and a more closed pore in the inner region. In line with this model, we found that L669C was sensitive to pCMBS, but not MTSEA, reflecting the larger steric bulk of pCMBS. Furthermore, A666C and S667C, the outermost sensitive mutants, both had lower pCMBS sensitivity than the inner mutants. We found that the sequence of pCMBS-inhibited residues ended at Leu680, which is consistent with the identification of Glu681 as the site of the permeability barrier. Since pCMBS can permeate the membrane only via AE1, it will not accumulate on the cytosolic surface to any extent. Conversely, MTSEA is membrane permeant in its deprotonated form (33Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and therefore can access the anion translocation pore from both the extracellular and intracellular surfaces. Finally, our data show that the greatest sensitivity to pCMBS is found with mutant L680C, which is adjacent to Glu681, the presumed permeability barrier. The high sensitivity at this site may reflect a smaller pore diameter. We thank Dr. Myles Akabas for helpful advice.

To design synthetic peptides from the ST40 paratope that could mimic these biological properties, a set of 220 overlapping 12-mer peptides frameshifted by one residue, corresponding to the deduced ST40 amino acid sequence, was synthesized by the Spot method and tested for binding to recombinant soluble CD4 antigen.

The diversity of paratopes is mainly generated by the sequences of the CDRs found in VH and VL, which are exposed hypervariable loop structures.

Our previous results showed that the systematic exploration of the antigen binding capacity of short peptides derived from an antibody sequence leads to the identification of numerous paratope-derived peptides (PDPs) that display significant affinity for the antigen (40Laune D. Molina F. Ferrières G. Mani J.-C. Cohen P. Simon D. Bernardi T. Piechaczyk M. Pau B. Granier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30937-30944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, this approach could be useful to identify potentially biologically active peptides from the sequence of a pharmacologically active antibody.In this study, we have established the nucleotide sequences of the VH and VL regions of mAb ST40. A set of immobilized overlapping dodecapeptides covering the deduced amino acid sequences of mAb ST40 variable regions was prepared by the Spot method (40Laune D. Molina F. Ferrières G. Mani J.-C.

Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The ability of biotinylated soluble CD4 (sCD4) to bind these peptides was then investigated and led to the selection of peptides with CD4 binding activity. All the selected PDPs prepared in a soluble cyclic form showed CD4 binding capacity, and three of them blocked HIV-1 promoter activity and efficiently competed with mAb ST40 for binding to CD4.DISCUSSIONThe identification, by using multiple peptide synthesis, of PDPs able to bind antigen was recently described by our group; several of these peptides display a significant fraction of the affinity of the whole antibody (40Laune D. Molina F. Ferrières G. Mani J.-C. Cohen P. Simon D. Bernardi T. Piechaczyk M. Pau B. Granier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30937-30944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, this approach could conceivably be used to screen peptide ligands mimicking the biological effect of a given antibody. With this perspective in mind, we have studied an anti-CD4 mAb (ST40) that shows interesting pharmacological activities. The ST40 antibody binds to the CDR3-like loop in D1 of CD4 and has been described as a strong inhibitor of HIV promoter activity and provirus transcription (24Benkirane M. Hirn M. Carrière D. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6898-6903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have established the VH and VL amino acid sequences of this antibody and assessed the reactivity of sCD4 with overlapping 12-mer peptides derived from these sequences by the Spot method (40Laune D. Molina F. Ferrières G. Mani J.-C. Cohen P. Simon D. Bernardi T. Piechaczyk M. Pau B. Granier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30937-30944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Eleven peptides were found to react strongly and specifically with the CD4 antigen. We demonstrated that soluble cyclic peptides derived from peptides reactive in the Spot assay were able to recognize the CD4 molecule and a cyclic CDR3-like loop peptide corresponding to region 81–92 of CD4. Among the CDR3-like loop-specific PDPs, three (CM2, CM9, and CM11) were found to block HIV promoter activity and to compete efficiently with the parental mAb for binding to CD4.An interesting feature was that PDPs showing the strongest reactivity with CD4 in the Spot assay included both residues from the CDRs and residues from the framework flanking the hypervariable regions, extending our previous observations (40Laune D. Molina F. Ferrières G. Mani J.-C. Cohen P. Simon D. Bernardi T. Piechaczyk M. Pau B. Granier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30937-30944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Antibody variable domains comprise a framework of β-sheets surmounted by antigen-binding loops. We can postulate that critical residues, identified in the Spot assay and confirmed by preliminary Alascan analysis (data not shown), located in the β-sheet framework closely underlying the CDRs, probably do not participate in direct interaction with CD4, but could induce a binding conformational state mimicking some of the structural features of the ST40 paratope. Three points argue in favor of this hypothesis. First, some framework amino acids that modulate the peptide/CD4 interaction (i.e. Tyr27, Trp47, Gly49, and Arg94 in the ST40 VHsequence and Tyr36 in the ST40 VL segment) belong to the vernier zone, which contains residues that adjust the CDR structure and fine-tune the fitting to the antigen (54Foote J. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Second, some residues possess an aromatic structure (i.e.Tyr27 and Trp47 in the heavy chain and Tyr36 in the light chain) characterized as protruding into the antigen-binding site surface to stabilize the antigen/antibody interaction (55Dougall W.C. Peterson N.C. Greene M.I. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 372-379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 56Bhat T.N. Bentley G. Boulot G. Greene M.I. Souchon H. Schwartz F. Mariuzza R. Poljak R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Third, framework arginine residues (i.e. Arg94 in VH and Arg18 in VL) modulate the peptide/CD4 binding, in keeping with previous work demonstrating the critical role of Arg94 in the interaction of a CDR3 VH peptide with phosphatidylserine (36Igarashi K. Asai K. Kaneda M. Umeda M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These six critical residues from the framework regions of the ST40 antibody possess one or several of these characteristics, in agreement with previous results obtained in our laboratory on the interactions of mAb HyHEL-5/lysozyme (40Laune D. Molina F. Ferrières G. Mani J.-C. Cohen P. Simon D. Bernardi T. Piechaczyk M. Pau B. Granier C. J. Biol.

Mani, P. Cohen, D. Simon, T. Bernardi, M. Piechaczyk, B. Pau, and C. Granier, unpublished data. Based on the observations that CDR3-like synthetic peptides can bind CD4, Langedijk et al. (30Langedijk J.P. Puijk W.C. van Hoorn W. Meloen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16875-16878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed that the putative dimerization of CD4 involves the CDR3-like loop in D1. Moreover, electrostatic potential contours calculated for a putative CD4 dimerization occurring in D1 predicted that the negative electrostatic potentials of the CDR3-like region were completely compensated for by positive charges on the opposite CD4 molecule in the dimer (30Langedijk J.P. Puijk W.C. van Hoorn W. Meloen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16875-16878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent results (29Briant L. Signoret N. Gaubin M. Robert-Hebmann V. Zhang X. Murali R. Greene M.I. Piatier-Tonneau D. Devaux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19441-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) suggest that Glu87, Asp88, Glu91, and Glu92 in the CDR3-like loop are essential for CD4 dimerization and that these four negatively charged amino acids are involved in the ST40 epitope. These observations may have important implications for understanding how mAb ST40 interacts with CD4. We can speculate that positively charged residues from the CDRs of mAb ST40 could participate in the paratope. The cyclic peptides CM2, CM6, and CM7 from the VH region and CM9 and CM11 from the VL domain have been demonstrated to bind strongly to the CDR3-like loop of CD4 domain 1, and Lys-Cys residues added for cyclization/solubilization are not implicated in this binding. Positively charged residues, like Arg100G and Arg100H found in the sequence of the PDPs CM6 and CM7 from the CDR3 VH region, Lys39 belonging to the sequence of peptide CM9 from the CDR1 VL domain, and Lys107 in the PDP CM11, could conceivably interact with the negatively charged residues of the ST40 epitope. In agreement with this hypothesis, Arg100H and Lys39 have been found to be critical amino acids by the Spot method in the peptide/CD4 interactions. Moreover, preliminary results obtained by Alascan analysis of PDPs confirm the contribution of these positively charged residues in CD4 binding (data not shown). However, positively charged amino acids probably reflect only a part of the interaction between ST40 and CD4 since other contributor residues in the CDRs were found by using Alascan analysis.With regard to the measured binding kinetics of the interaction between soluble linear peptides from the HyHEL-5 paratope and lysozyme (40Laune D. Molina F. Ferrières G. Mani J.-C. Cohen P. Simon D. Bernardi T. Piechaczyk M. Pau B. Granier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30937-30944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a 1-log decrease in the k d was observed in the peptide/CD4 binding, whereas association rates were in the same order of magnitude in the two models. In the case of anti-reovirus mAb 87.92.6 (34Williams W.V. Kieber-Emmons T. VonFeldt J. Greene M.I. Weiner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5182-5190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been reported that the increased conformational stability of cyclic CDR peptides could increase the binding affinity. In addition, other reports (26Zhang X. Gaubin M. Briant L. Srikantan V. Murali R. Saragovi U. Weiner D. Devaux C. Autiero M. Piatier-Tonneau D. Greene M.I.

Science. 1991; 253: 792-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) suggest that cyclization helps peptides to mimic the CDR conformation. From these observations and from the results obtained with the CM peptide series, it seems that constraining the PDPs improves their affinity for antigen through a decrease in the dissociation rate of the equilibrium reaction between ligands. All the selected PDPs were able to bind sCD4 withK D values ranging from ∼2 to 90 nm, the best values being 4–8-fold higher than those obtained with the parental mAb.mAb ST40 has been previously shown to inhibit HIV-1 LTR-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression induced by HIV-1Lai (24Benkirane M. Hirn M. Carrière D. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6898-6903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PDP CM9, derived from region 30–41 of the ST40 CDR2 VL domain, blocks HIV promoter activity through the inhibition of β-galactosidase gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. The biological effect of CM9 was corroborated by further BIAcore experiments, in which this peptide was shown to displace the binding of ST40 to CD4 by increasing the rate of the dissociation reaction. Numerous bioactive peptides corresponding to the CDR3-like loop have been used to modulate the T-cell response (14McDonnell J.M. Blank K.J. Rao P.E. Jameson B.A. J.

Disruption of CD4 dimerization by CDR3-like analogs has been proposed as a major mechanism by which cell activation could be inhibited following treatment of CD4-positive cells by CDR3-like analogs (18Koch U.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16875-16878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, negatively charged residues in amino acid region 87–92 of CD4 can potentially be involved in the binding of a CDR3-like analog to CD4 (29Briant L. Signoret N. Gaubin M. Robert-Hebmann V. Zhang X. Murali R. Greene M.I. Piatier-Tonneau D. Devaux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19441-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The facts that (i) the PDP CM9 interacts with CDR3-like region 81–92 and inhibits HIV-1 promoter activity and that (ii) residues 87/88 and 91/92 are involved in the epitope of the ST40 antibody, from which peptide CM9 has been designed, suggest that this PDP could act as an inhibitor of CD4 dimerization. Such an effect needs to be confirmed by additional experiments, even though we cannot rule out the fact that other CD4 regions might contribute to the oligomerization. Our results clearly demonstrate that the systematic exploration of sets of short cellulose-bound synthetic overlapping peptides derived from the sequences of immunoglobulin variable regions is a valuable strategy for identifying bioactive PDPs. The CD4 molecule is a transmembrane glycoprotein (58 kDa) found on thymocytes, mature T-cells, macrophages, monocytes, and Langerhans' cells (1Littman D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1987; 5: 561-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This surface protein is required to shape the T-cell repertoire during thymic development (2Kruisbeek A.M. Mond J.J.

https://openalex.org/W2086495242,"Abstract Angiotensin II (Ang II) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are important modulators of cell growth under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We and others have previously shown that these growth factors increase insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) number and mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells and that this effect is transcriptionally regulated. To study the mechanisms and the signaling pathways involved, IGF-1R promoter reporter constructs were transiently transfected in CHO-AT1 cells that overexpress angiotensin AT1 receptors. Our findings indicate that Ang II and bFGF significantly increased IGF-1R promoter activity up to 7- and 3-fold, respectively. The effect induced by Ang II was mediated via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism, since tyrphostin A25 largely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in promoter activity. In addition, co-transfection of dominant negative Ras, Raf, and MEK1 or pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 dose-dependently decreased both the Ang II- and bFGF-induced increase in IGF-1R transcription and protein expression, suggesting that the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase pathway is required for both growth factors. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to act as second messengers in Ang II-induced signaling, and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is redox-sensitive. While co-transfection of dominant negative IκBα mutant completely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in transcription, it had no effect on the bFGF signaling. In contrast, co-transfection studies indicated that the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, and c-Jun and the Janus kinase 2 kinase are required in the signaling pathway of bFGF, whereas only dominant c-Jun inhibited the Ang II-induced effect. In summary, these data demonstrate that Ang II and bFGF increase IGF-1R gene transcription via distinct as well as shared pathways and have important implications for understanding growth-stimulatory effects of these growth factors on vascular cells."
https://openalex.org/W2138370026,"Plant mitochondrial genes are often transcribed into complex sets of RNAs, resulting from multiple initiation sites and processing steps. To elucidate the role of initiation in generating the more than 10 cox2 transcripts found in maize mitochondria, we surveyed sequences upstream of cox2 for active promoters. Because the cox2 coding region is immediately downstream of a 0.7-kb recombination repeat, cox2 is under the control of two different sets of potential expression signals. Using an in vitro transcription assay, we localized four promoters upstream of the coding region in the so-called master chromosome, and two promoters upstream of the coding region in the recombinant subgenome. Ribonuclease protection analysis of labeled primary transcripts confirmed that all but one of these promoters is active in vivo. Primer extension was used to identify the promoter sequences and initiation sites, which agree with the consensus established earlier for maize mitochondria. This study identified two unusual promoters, the core sequences of which were composed entirely of adenines and thymines, and one of which was a complex promoter consisting of seven overlapping units. Deletion mutagenesis of the complex promoter suggested that each of its units was recognized independently by RNA polymerase. While each active promoter fit the maize core consensus sequence YRTAT, not all such sequences surveyed supported initiation. We conclude that in vitrotranscription is a powerful tool for locating mitochondrial promoters and that, in the case of cox2, promoter multiplicity contributes strongly to transcript complexity.

We conclude that in vitrotranscription is a powerful tool for locating mitochondrial promoters and that, in the case of cox2, promoter multiplicity contributes strongly to transcript complexity. The transcriptional strategies of vascular plant mitochondrial genomes differ from those of their fungal and metazoan counterparts, with a major region being genome structure. Plant mitochondrial genomes are relatively large and the genes are mostly dispersed (1Fauron C. Casper M. Gao Y. Moore B. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 228-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Unseld M. Marienfeld J.R. Brandt P. Brennicke A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). In contrast, metazoan genomes are compact and have a single promoter for each DNA strand, and the Saccharomyces cerevisiaemitochondrial genome is 75 kb, 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; WT, wild-type. and contains about 20 promoters (reviewed in Ref. 3Tracy R.L. Stern D.B. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The maize mitochondrial genome, the expression of which we have studied, can be mapped as a 570-kb circle with numerous repeated elements mediating recombination, leading to a complex set of overlapping molecules (4Lonsdale D.M. Hodge T.P. Fauron C.M.-R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9249-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Based on recent microscopic studies (5Bendich A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 564-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), these molecules are likely to be linearly permuted. Promoter analysis in plant mitochondria has been accelerated in the last several years by the development of in vitrotranscription systems from wheat (6Hanic-Joyce P.J. Gray M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), maize (7Rapp W.D. Stern D.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and pea (8Binder S. Hatzack F. Brennicke A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22182-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Extensive mutational analysis of the maize atpA and cox3promoters showed that the only universally-present sequence required for transcription initiation in vitro was YRTAT (Y = T or C and R = G or A), located at or immediately upstream of the start site (9Rapp W.D. Lupold D.S. Mack S. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7232-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Caoile A.G.F.S. Stern D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4055-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Even this degenerate sequence, however, is not found near all 5′ termini identified as transcription start sites based on their ability to be capped in vitro by guanylyl transferase (11Mulligan R.M. Leon P. Walbot V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). While some of these promoters may be recognized by specific transcription factors (12Newton K.J. Winberg B. Yamato K. Lupold S. Stern D.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the frequency of active promoters has not been surveyed over large regions of any plant mitochondrial genome. Such an approach might aid in identifying contextual features other than YRTAT that constitute functional promoters, at least in maize mitochondria. Maize cox2, which encodes subunit II of cytochromec oxidase, was the first plant mitochondrial gene to be cloned and sequenced (13Fox T.D. Leaver C.J. Cell. 1981; 26: 315-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). RNA filter hybridization analysis ofcox2 transcripts in maize mitochondria identified at least 11 distinct messages. Since cox2 contains only a single intron, multiple 5′ and/or 3′ ends must account for most of these RNA species. Here we investigate how genomic context and promoter multiplicity contribute to cox2 transcript diversity, and show that in vitro transcription is a useful means to identify previously unknown promoters. Cosmids N5G8 and N6A6 (Fig. 1; Ref. 4Lonsdale D.M. Hodge T.P. Fauron C.M.-R.

The BamHI and XhoI fragments illustrated in Fig.2 were gel-purified and inserted into plasmid vectors, generating plasmids pN1, pN2, pN4, and pN7. To generate antisense single-stranded DNA for mapping of capped transcript 5′ termini, the subfragments shown in Fig. 2 were inserted into pBluescript (Stratagene, Inc.) in the appropriate orientation. These plasmids were pN1VV (from theEcoRV site in pBS to the EcoRV site in pN1), pN2AR (from the XbaI to RsaI sites in pN2), and pN7PT (from the ApaI site in pBS to the AatII site in pN7).Figure 2Maize mtDNA regions upstream of thecox2 gene. N6A6 and N5G8 are cosmid clones shown in Fig. 1, which represent segments of the master chromosome.

Lonsdale (John Innes Institute, Norwich, United Kingdom) or on sequence data that we generated from the region A cosmid, respectively. SL5 begins 804 bp upstream of the 0.7-kb repeat and has the sequence ACTCAGTCCTGCTAG, and SL6 begins 163 bp upstream of the repeat and has the sequence GATGTAACGAGCACTC. SL7B begins approximately 3190 bp upstream of the repeat and immediately upstream of the EcoRV site, and has the sequence CAACATGAGAAGATC. SL9 begins 10 bp upstream of the repeat and has the sequence ACAGCGTTTGTCCAT. To generate the deletions of the complex promoter illustrated in Fig.7, pN2 was linearized with MluI, which cleaves immediately upstream of promoter A2a. 10 μg of plasmid DNA were digested with 5 units of Bal31 for 10–45 s at room temperature. The pooled products were repaired with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and religated. Escherichia coli colonies were screened by the polymerase chain reaction for inserts of the approximate size desired, and the precise deletion end points were determined by DNA sequencing. Subclones of the cosmids were linearized with various restriction enzymes as shown in Fig. 3, andin vitro transcription was carried out as described previously (7Rapp W.D. Stern D.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The sizes of transcripts were estimated by comparison to a DNA size ladder made using 32P-labeled φX174 RF DNA digested with HinfI. RNA was isolated from gradient-purified mitochondria of 4-day-old dark-grown maize seedlings. 100 μg of RNA was capped using 15 units of guanylyl transferase and 250 μCi of [32P]GTP, as described previously (11Mulligan R.M. Leon P. Walbot V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 10 μg (106 cpm) of labeled RNA was incubated with 500 ng of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) under conditions previously described (11Mulligan R.M. Leon P. Walbot V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), with denaturation at 85 °C for 10 min and annealing at 42 °C overnight. The hybrids were digested with 50 or 250 ng of RNase A. The protected transcripts were separated in denaturing polyacrylamide gels using the DNA markers described above. Primer extension was carried out using the same RNA preparations and oligonucleotides labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Sequence ladders were generated from appropriate plasmid clones using the same primers. Fig. 1 shows that thecox2 coding region is located immediately downstream of a 0.7-kb direct repeat sequence, present in two copies in the maize mitochondrial master chromosome. Recombination across these repeats generates the two postulated subgenomes shown at the right of Fig. 1. In the master chromosome, cox2 is preceded by sequences which we have designated region B, whereas in subgenome 1,cox2 is downstream of region A. Conversely, in the master chromosome region A is upstream of sequences of unknown function (designated NC), whereas region B is upstream of NC in subgenome 2. Since the master chromosome and subgenomes co-exist in vivo(4Lonsdale D.M. Hodge T.P. Fauron C.M.-R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9249-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), 2D. S. Lupold and D. B. Stern, unpublished results. promoters drivingcox2 transcription could be located in regions A and B, and/or in the repeat sequence. Fig. 2shows a more detailed map of the A, B, cox2, repeat and NC regions, and the plasmid clones that were made in order to systematically search these regions for promoters using in vitro transcription. While most of region B, the repeat, and thecox2 coding sequence are present in the data base, region A is not, and therefore clones were mapped for restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. Closely spaced sites were required because our in vitro transcription assay best resolves 50–500-nt transcripts, thus our goal was to find unique sites 0.5 kb apart or less. Clones linearized at each unique site were used as templates for in vitro transcription. Fig. 3 (top) shows examples ofin vitro transcription reactions in which promoter activity could be identified. Other plasmid/restriction endonuclease combinations did not yield resolvable transcripts. A summary of the clones tested and the transcripts obtained is given in TableI. Fig. 3 (bottom) summarizes the locations of promoters deduced from in vitrotranscription. Two promoters are found in region A: A1, which is located approximately 3 kb upstream of the 0.7-kb repeat; and A2, which is immediately upstream of the repeat. Remarkably, A2 (hereafter referred to as the “complex promoter”) gave rise to seven transcripts differing in size by 5 nt. Four promoters were found in region B, all clustered within 1 kb of the 0.7-kb repeat. No promoters were detected within the repeat. Taken together, these results suggested that cox2 could be transcribed from either the master chromosome or subgenome 1, and that up to six promoters, including a complex promoter, might contribute to RNA accumulationin vivo.Table IIn vitro transcription templates and their productsRegionCloneEnzymeTranscript sizePromoter(s)ntAN1XbaINoneNoneAN1EcoRV200A1AN1NsiINoneNoneAN1XhoINoneNoneAN2BglIINoneNoneAN2RsaI250,245,240,235,230,225,220A2BN4BglIINoneNoneBN4XhoINoneNoneBN4EcoRV400B1BN7SpeINoneNoneBN7StuINoneNoneBN7XbaI280B1BN7AccI560,200B1,B2BN7AatII500,380B3,B4Each line refers to a template which was tested for promoter activity using in vitro transcription.

Transcript size refers to the product(s) observed; “None” indicates that no transcript was seen in the resolvable range (approximately 50–500 nt). It was possible that in vitro transcription would give artifactual promoter activity at a site that was not used in vivo. To determine whether the in vitro start sites coincided with primary transcript 5′ ends, we used a combination ofin vitro guanylyl transferase capping (G-capping) and RNase protection. Since plant mitochondrial transcripts are not cappedin vivo, primary transcripts (those with di- or triphosphate termini) can be labeled in vitro with [32P]GTP. Total maize mitochondrial RNA was labeled in this way and then annealed to ssDNA complementary to thecox2 regions containing putative promoters. The hybrids were digested with RNase A and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Fig. 4 A shows the protected primary transcripts corresponding to promoters A1, A2, B1, B3, and B4. The promoter identifications were based on the sizes of protected transcripts, coupled with knowledge of the in vitro start sites (Fig. 3) and primer extension (see below). Fig. 4 Bsummarizes the verified promoters and the ssDNAs used to protect the primary transcripts. Of the promoters identified by in vitrotranscription, only B2 was not identified by capping. This suggests that either B2 is an in vitro artifact, or that the primary transcript from B2 is rapidly processed in vivo. Although we cannot distinguish between these two alternatives, the weak usage of B2in vitro (Fig. 3) suggests that at best, B2 is a marginal promoter in vivo. Taken together, these results confirm thatcox2 is transcribed by multiple promoters in two distant genomic regions, and that the maize mitochondrial in vitrotranscription system can be reliably used to locate promoters in sequences of unknown function. We have previously determined the essential features of maize mitochondrial promoters by using several types of mutagenesis (7Rapp W.D. Stern D.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,9Rapp W.D. Lupold D.S. Mack S. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7232-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Caoile A.G.F.S. Stern D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4055-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A key feature of these promoters is the so-called core sequence, which has the consensus YRTAT; mutations in the core severely reduce or abolish transcription in vitro. Transcription initiates at the final T or within a few bp downstream. Primer extension was used to identify the precise initiation sites of thecox2 promoters. These experiments were carried out in using total mtRNA, and the results are shown in Fig.5. For each promoter identified by capping and in vitro transcription, a single start site was found, except that seven start sites were found in the complex promoter (A2a–g). The promoter sequences and initiation sites are summarized in Fig.6, and compared with the consensus sequence derived for the atpA promoter (9Rapp W.D. Lupold D.S. Mack S. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7232-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All of the promoters had sequences within 5 bp upstream of the start site that fully matched the consensus sequence for the core region, either CGTAT or TATAT. Their match with the overall consensus sequence was variable, ranging between 79% and 100%. The importance of the consensus sequence apart from the core is suggested by the fact that promoter A1, which was the weakest promoter in vitro, had the lowest percent match. Interestingly, promoters A2b–g and B3 are the first mitochondrial promoters identified in which the core sequences are composed of only A and T nucleotides. The complex promoter A2 is highly unusual and consists of one “typical” CGTAT core sequence promoter, followed by seven copies of the repeated sequence GTATATA. This repeated sequence contains a putative TATAT core sequence, and gives rise to six additional overlapping promoters, with the overlap coming between the core and the purine-rich upstream domain (see Fig. 6). We envisioned two models for recognition of the complex promoter by the transcriptional machinery, as diagrammed in Fig.7 C. In the scanning model, the first (CGTAT core) promoter nucleates the transcriptional apparatus, which then either initiates transcription or scans downstream sequences for an alternative promoter. In the stochastic model, the transcription apparatus can independently recognize each individual promoter, although since the mitochondrial genome is multipartite this could be occurring on separate molecules. The RNase protection and primer extension data (Figs. 4 and 5) show that approximately twice as many transcripts initiate at the first promoter as at each of the downstream promoters, which yield similar amounts of transcripts. These results could favor the stochastic model, if one assumes that CGTAT is a stronger core sequence than TATAT, or if one assumes that the downstream promoters are disfavored because they are overlapping. However, a scanning model also predicts increased initiation at the first promoter, but also a successive reduction in initiation at each following promoter, which is seen in Fig. 3 (in vitro) but not in Figs. 4 and 5 (in vivo). To determine whether the first promoter was required to anchor transcription as proposed by the scanning model, we generatedBal31 deletion mutants lacking the first promoter and variable amounts of the downstream promoters, as shown in Fig.7 A. These constructs were used for in vitrotranscription analysis, as shown in Fig. 7 B. In each case, the remaining promoters are transcriptionally active, which rules out a scanning model dependent on the CGTAT-containing promoter. In the analysis of these deletion mutants, we noted that there was some ambiguity in the assignment of start sites. In particular, in theWT lane there is an additional diffuse band migrating slower than the band that we believe represents promoter A2a, and in the deletion constructs the number of residual start sites did not always coincide with the expected number. For example, we expected two additional start sites in mutant Δ3 versus Δ5, but if this is the case the two largest transcripts from Δ3 were unexpectedly weak. These subtleties may result from sequence contexts arising out of the ligation of different bidirectional deletions. Here we have looked globally at promoters potentially driving maize mitochondrial cox2 transcription. The screen for promoters was carried out using an in vitro transcription system, and the reliability of this approach was confirmed in five of six cases using analysis of mtRNA. Each promoter conforms to a previously established consensus sequence for maize mitochondrial promoters, although there are some with unusual features. This promoter multiplicity can help account for the complexity of accumulatingcox2 transcripts. Approximately 8.4 kb of DNA was examined for promoter activity in this study. Of the six promoters active in vitro, each was flanked by a sequence fitting the consensus YRTAT, with little homology upstream (see Fig. 6). Clearly, if YRTAT were the only requirement for promoter activity, a much larger number should have been detected. For example, in the part of region B that we surveyed (4.75 kb), YRTAT appears 18 times, including 5 matches of CGTAT, the most common core motif in maize mitochondrial promoters (11Mulligan R.M. Leon P. Walbot V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The number of YRTAT matches is close to that expected by chance, suggesting that there is no bias to exclude such sequences from the genome. These results suggest that YRTAT is necessary, but not sufficient for promoter activity in our assay system. It is possible that other features such as DNA bending, which occurs at human and yeast mitochondrial promoters (14Fisher R.P. Lisowsky T. Parisi M.A. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3358-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schinkel A.H. Groot-Koerkamp M.J.A. Teunissen A.W.R.H. Tabak H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9147-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), contribute to promoter recognition and usage in maize mitochondria. Promoter B2 was active in vitro but not in vivo. While this result could be explained by a rapid processing of B2-initiated transcripts in vivo, it is also possible that this promoter-like sequence is not recognized in the cellular environment. For example, a conserved sequence that acts as an 18 S rRNA promoter in Arabidopsis, potato, andOenothera is inactive in vivo in pea (16Giese A. Thalheim C. Brennicke A. Binder S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar). This again points to features other than the primary sequence that mediate promoter site selection. Interestingly, the yeast mitochondrial genome also contains many promoter-like sequences that are not active in vivo, but are active in vitro (17Biswas T.K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Analysis of these variants suggests that they are inactive in vivo not because RNA polymerase is unable to bind, but instead because elongation does not occur. Thus, multiple criteria must be satisfied if transcription initiation is to occur successfully. Some of the promoters identified in this study are far from thecox2 coding region, such as A1 (>4 kb) and B1 (>1.5 kb). The fact that these are used for cox2 transcription in vivo is consistent with the lengths of some cox2transcripts (13Fox T.D. Leaver C.J. Cell. 1981; 26: 315-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) as well as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results in which cox2-primed cDNAs could be amplified with primers downstream of each promoter.2 While such a distance between coding region and promoter is unusual, it is not unprecedented. For example, the atpA promoter is more than 2 kb upstream of the coding region, and there may be another promoter even further upstream (11Mulligan R.M. Leon P. Walbot V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several other maize mitochondrial genes have multiple promoters (18Mulligan R.M. Lau G.T. Walbot V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7998-8002Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Mulligan R.M. Maloney A.P. Walbot V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). So far, however, the combination of promoter distance and number, along with the presence of the coding region downstream of a recombination repeat, places cox2 in a unique category. The 0.7-kb repeat upstream of cox2 contains no promoters, and does not flank the cox2 gene in other maize cytoplasms such as cms-T and NA188 (1Fauron C. Casper M. Gao Y. Moore B. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 228-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, the configuration in the genome we examined (NB37) is the only one of the three in which repeat-driven transcription could express cox2. In the maize ancestor teosinte, the cox2 transcription pattern is simple (20Cooper P. Butler D. Newton K.J. Genetics. 1990; 126: 461-467PubMed Google Scholar) and driven by two promoters, one of which is dependent on a nuclear locus that may encode a specific transcription factor (12Newton K.J. Winberg B. Yamato K. Lupold S. Stern D.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These data highlight the plasticity of plant mitochondrial genomes, and the multiplicity of promoters may ensure the expression of genes despite frequent mtDNA rearrangements during evolution (21Palmer J.D. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 115-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Two unusual promoters were uncovered by this study, namely A2 and B3. Both of these promoters have the novel core consensus TATAT, except A2a, which has a classic core motif. While we have not tested the importance of each of these positions in the cox2 promoters by mutagenesis, there is no other nearby sequence that matches the consensus, and indeed more than 10 bp upstream of promoter B3 consist of A or T. The ability of all-A+T sequences to function as mitochondrial promoters is illustrated indirectly by the recovery of two yeast petite mutants which are able to replicate, yet possess mitochondrial genomes consisting only of A-T base pairs (22Fangman W.L. Dujon B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7156-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since replication is most likely initiated with an RNA primer (23Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), one can infer that transcription initiation occurs within these A-T sequences. Promoter A2 consists of seven units punctuated by guanosines, and these units overlap if one includes the upstream purine-rich region. Each of these units can be recognized both in vitro and in vivo, which is most consistent with them acting independently. Our results do not address the question of whether more than one transcription complex can simultaneously bind to this region. This complex promoter could have arisen by slippage during DNA replication, a mechanism that probably can generate short tandem repeats in chloroplasts (24Chang T.L. Stoike L.L. Zarka D. Schewe G. Chiu W.L. Jarrell D.C. Sears B.B. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Overlapping promoters are somewhat unusual in the literature, and we have not found anything closely resemblingcox2 promoter A2. There are related instances, for example the interspersed –35 and –10 elements of the two E. colivalyl-tRNA synthetase promoters (25Heck J.D. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the spinach chloroplast 16 S rRNA nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase (NEP) promoter, which lies between the –35 and –10 elements of an E. coli-like promoter (26Iratni R. Baeza L. Andreeva A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2928-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). While the valS promoters are used differentially in vivo and in vitro, in vivo and in vitro assays for spinach rrn16 and cox2 are in agreement. Whether A2 has any special significance forcox2 expression in vivo remains to be determined. In summary, promoter multiplicity is not uncommon in mitochondria, and seems to be particularly prevalent in maize. One could speculate that this arrangement lends flexibility to modes of gene expression, particularly if promoters are differentially used and if the resulting different 5′-untranslated regions influence translational yield. Maize mitochondrial transcripts (27Li X.Q. Zhang M. Brown G.G. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1961-1975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and translation products (28Newton K.J. Walbot V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6879-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have been shown to vary between tissues, consistent with this possibility. Another reason to maintain multiple promoters is to maintain gene expression in the face of frequent genome rearrangements, including intragenomic recombination, as discussed above. However, in vitro experiments suggest that transcription termination may not be efficient in plant mitochondria (29Dombrowski S. Brennicke A. Binder S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5069-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), meaning that read-through synthesis along with RNA processing events could substitute in some cases for gene-specific promoters, as is the case for some chloroplast genes (30Sturm N. Kuras R. Büschlen S. Sakamoto W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Wollman F.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6171-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Evidence for transcription of known non-coding regions in maize mitochondria (31Finnegan P.M. Brown G.G. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) points to RNA stability as another key control point in gene expression. A contrasting point of view to the above is that complex transcription patterns are a consequence of multiple promoters, which themselves are a consequence of a promiscuous transcriptional machinery.

Cotransfection of various c-metpromoter reporter vectors with p53 expression plasmids demonstrated that only wild-type p53 but not tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 resulted in a significant enhancement of c-met promoter activity. Functional assays revealed that the p53 responsive element in the c-met promoter region is located at position −278 to −216 and confers p53 responsiveness not only in the context of the c-met promoter but also in the context of a heterologous promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using purified recombinant p53 protein showed that the p53 binding element identified within the c-met promoter specifically binds to p53 protein. Induction of p53 by UV irradiation in RKO cells that express wild-type p53 increased the level of the endogenous c-metgene product and p21WAF1/CIP1, a known target of p53 regulation. On the other hand, in RKO cells in which the function of p53 is impaired either by stable transfection of a dominant negative form of p53 or by HPV-E6 viral protein, no induction of the endogenous c-met gene or p21WAF1/CIP1 was noted by UV irradiation.

Animal experiments demonstrated that HGF/c-Met are important in organ regeneration in adults, and studies using HGF or c-met gene knock-out mice have shown that this receptor-ligand system plays a pivotal role in embryonic development and normal growth (11Bladt F.

It also mediates the movement and invasiveness of neoplastic cells and promotes metastasis (6Weidner K.M. Behrens J. Vanderckhove J. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Transgenic mouse models that overexpress HGF or in which an autocrine loop between HGF and c-Met was established show accelerated tumor formation (17Bell A. Chen Q. DeFrances M.C. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar, 18Takayama H. LaRochelle W.J. Sharp R. Otsuka T. Kriebel P. Anver M. Aaronson S.A. Merlino G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tripodi M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The HGF/c-Met signaling system has also been shown to relay tumor suppressor activities, as activation of this signaling pathway results in growth inhibition of some tumor cells, and the expression of c-Met is reduced or lost in other tumor tissues (20Tajima H. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Santoni-Rugiu E. Preisegger K.H. Kiss A. Audolfsson T. Shiota G. Schmidt E.V. Thorgeirsson S.S.

Moreover, in c-myc/HGF double transgenic mice, HGF behaves as a tumor suppressor gene antagonizing the tumorigenic effect of c-myc(23Thorgeirsson S.S. Santoni-Rugiu E. Mutat. Res. 1997; 376: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing the transcriptional regulation of the c-met gene is crucial to understand the role of HGF/c-Met in normal and neoplastic growth. The molecular mechanisms regulating c-met gene transcription are largely unknown. Previously, our laboratory reported the cloning and functional characterization of the mouse c-met gene promoter (24Seol D.-W. Zarnegar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that the region between −278 and −78 of the promoter contains positive regulatory elements, including two Sp1 binding sites that are essential for promoter function. In that study, we also identified a putative p53 binding site within the −278 to −78 region of the promoter by computer analysis. Therefore, we focused on the functionality of the potential p53 binding site and its involvement in the transcriptional regulation of the c-metgene. Using various c-met gene promoter constructs and p53 expression vectors, our current study demonstrates that mouse c-met gene promoter activity is transactivated by wild-type p53 but not by several tumor-derived mutant forms of p53; the p53-mediated transactivation of the c-met gene promoter is dependent upon direct binding of p53 to the cognate binding site identified in the c-met gene promoter; induction of p53 by UV irradiation in RKO cells that express wild-type p53 increased the level of the endogenous c-met gene product and p21WAF1/CIP1, a known target of p53 regulation, and in RKO cells in which the function of p53 is impaired either by stable transfection of a dominant negative form of p53 or by HPV-E6 viral protein, no induction of the endogenous c-met gene or p21WAF1/CIP1 is observed. These findings shed new light on the regulation of c-met gene expression. 1.6-, 0.5-, and 0.4mc-met-CAT constructs were made as described previously (24Seol D.-W. Zarnegar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, theNotI-EcoRI genomic DNA fragment containing the mouse c-met gene promoter region was subcloned into the pBluescript II SK(+) plasmid. The plasmid containing the c-met insert was cut with SalI, and then the 2-kilobase pair DNA fragment was subcloned into the SalI site of the promoterless pCAT-Basic plasmid (Promega, WI) to construct the 2.0mc-met-CAT. The vector 1.6mc-met-CAT (−1390, +184) was prepared by cutting the 2.0mc-met-CAT with XbaI and BstXI, blunt-ending with DNA polymerase I, followed by religation. To generate the 0.5mc-met-CAT vector (−278, +184), the 1.6mc-met-CAT construct was cut with HindIII and ApaI, blunt-ended, and religated. The 0.4mc-met-CAT vector (−209, +184) was obtained by digestion of the 1.6mc-met-CAT construct with ApaI andKpnI, followed by self-ligation. RGC-W-3X-CAT and RGC-M-3X-CAT vectors, which are the positive and negative control vectors, respectively, for p53-mediated stimulation, have been described previously (25Osifchin N.E. Jiang D.

To construct the p53-E1BCAT plasmid, a 63-base pair synthetic DNA fragment (−278 to −216) with an addedXhoI site at the 5′ end was inserted into theXhoI site of E1BCAT vector which contains only a minimal promoter element. The internal deletion mutant vector 1.6Dp53mc-met-CAT was prepared by digestion of the 1.6mc-met-CAT construct withApaI and KpnI, followed by self-ligation. Wild-type and mutant p53 expression vectors have been described previously (26Pietenpol J.A. Takahashi T. Thiagalingam S. El-Deiry W.S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They contain a full-length human cDNA sequence for wild-type or various mutant p53 proteins inserted downstream of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter/enhancer in the pCMV-Neo-Bam vector. The p53 expression vectors and the RGC-W-3X-CAT, RGC-M-3X-CAT plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Paul Robbins, Department of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. The p53 mutant cell line C-33A obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) was maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and gentamycin (100 μg/ml). The RKO cell line is a colon carcinoma cell line that contains the wild-type p53 gene. The RKOmp53 cell line is an RKO derivative stably transfected with a mutant p53 encoding gene. The RKO-E6 cell line is a clone isolated after RKO cells were transfected with human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein gene driven by the CMV promoter (27Smith M.L. Chen I. Zhan Q. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1053-1059PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured and treated with UV light for 3 h as described previously (27Smith M.L. Chen I. Zhan Q. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1053-1059PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection using the calcium phosphate precipitation method was carried out as described previously (28Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Liu Y. Beedle A. Lin L. Bell A. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7046-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and analyzed for CAT activity. Normalization for CAT activity was performed based on the protein concentration of each cell lysate. A 63-base pair DNA fragment containing the c-met p53 binding site (5′-CCAGGAGGGACCGTTGGGGACAAACCTAGAGCGACAGGGACGAACAGACACGTGCTGGGGCGG-3′, from −278 to −216; p53 binding half-sites are underlined) and a consensus p53 binding site (5′-AGGCATGCCTAGGCATGCCT-3′) (26Pietenpol J.A. Takahashi T. Thiagalingam S. El-Deiry W.S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1998-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) were chemically synthesized and used as probes and competitors. A purified p53 core domain protein (amino acids 102–292) was a generous gift of Dr. Nikola P. Pavletich (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) (30Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides described above were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and used as probes. Protein-DNA binding analysis was carried out in a buffer described previously (29Liu Y. Beedle A. Lin L. Bell A. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7046-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) consisting of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 6% glycerol, 2% Ficoll, and 50 ng of nonspecific DNA (poly(dI·dC)). For competition experiments, 100- or 200-fold molar excess of specific or nonspecific oligonucleotide competitors were added to the reaction mixture. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, reaction mixtures were loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide gels, and run in 0.5× TBE at room temperature. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Total cell lysate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions as described previously (31Chen Q.Y. DeFrances M.C. Zarnegar R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 821-832PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Ponceau S (Sigma) staining was performed to confirm the proper loading and transfer of proteins and to normalize the signals. Nonspecific binding to the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer, and then specific antibodies were added. c-Met protein was detected by addition of a polyclonal anti-c-Met antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 were detected with anti-p53 and anti-p21WAF1/CIP1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively, followed by addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma). The signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL) solution (NEN Life Science Products). Previously, our laboratory cloned and functionally characterized the mouse c-met 5′-flanking region (24Seol D.-W. Zarnegar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the mouse c-met gene promoter region identified a potential p53 binding site at −278 to −216 (Fig.1 A), which indicates the possible involvement of the p53 tumor suppressor gene product in the transcriptional regulation of the c-met gene. To determine if p53 regulates c-met gene promoter activity, C-33A carcinoma cells, which harbor a mutated p53, were cotransfected with a reporter vector containing the c-met gene promoter region (−1390 to +184, relative to the transcription start site) (24Seol D.-W. Zarnegar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) fused to the CAT reporter gene, and expression vectors for wild-type or tumor-derived mutant forms of p53. Fig. 1 B is a representative CAT assay result. c-met gene promoter activity was enhanced significantly by coexpression of wild-type p53 as compared with the c-met promoter construct cotransfected with an expression vector lacking p53 encoding sequence (labeledvector in Fig. 1). However, cotransfection of expression plasmids encoding three different mutant forms of p53 did not affect c-met gene promoter activity in parallel experiments. The reporter construct RGC-W-3X-CAT containing three wild-type p53 binding sites was also stimulated by cotransfection with expression plasmid encoding wild-type p53, and, as expected, promoter activities of the RGC-M-3X-CAT plasmid containing three copies of mutant p53 binding site and the pCAT-Basic plasmid (which is promoterless) were not affected by forced expression of wild-type p53. Stimulation of the c-metgene promoter by wild-type p53 was dependent upon the input dose of wild-type p53 (Fig. 1 C). To functionally identify the region in the c-met gene promoter that is responsible for p53-mediated stimulation, a series of 5′ end deletion mutants were constructed and cotransfected with wild-type p53 expression plasmid (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 Bshows the results of CAT assays. Deletion from the 5′ end to −279 did not alter the stimulating effect of wild-type p53 on the c-met gene promoter. However, deletion of 70 base pairs from −278 to −209 completely eliminated responsiveness to p53. To assess functionality of the identified c-met p53 response element in the context of the c-met gene promoter, an internal deletion mutant of the c-met promoter (1.6Dp53mc-met-CAT) was constructed in which the identified c-met p53 response element (−278 to −216) was deleted (Fig.3 A). Cotransfection of the wild-type c-met construct (1.6mc-met-CAT) with the wild-type p53 expression plasmid resulted in stimulation of c-met gene promoter activity. In contrast, p53-mediated stimulation of c-met promoter activity was completely abolished in the mutant construct when cotransfected with wild-type p53 expression plasmid (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the nucleotide sequence from −278 to −216 in the c-metpromoter region contains an element(s) responsible for p53-mediated transactivation.Figure 3Dependence of p53-mediated stimulation of the c-met gene promoter on the c-met p53 response element. The 1.6Dp53mc-met-CAT construct in which the identified p53 response element (−278 to −216) was internally deleted from the 1.6mc-met-CAT construct was prepared as shown in A. 2 μg of 1.6mc-met-CAT or 1.6Dp53mc-met-CAT construct were cotransfected with 2 μg of wild-type p53 expression plasmid using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and analyzed for CAT activity. Transfection experiments and CAT assays were performed three times in duplicate, and the results are depicted as relative CAT activity (-fold increase over the corresponding met-CAT construct that did not receive p53 expression plasmid) (B). The bar indicates the standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The consensus p53 binding site is the 10-bp element of 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3′ (32El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). For high affinity binding, two 10-bp sites are required. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the c-met p53 response element within −278 to −216 region contains two 10-bp p53 binding sites, 5′-GGACAAACCT-3′ from −261 to −252 and 5′-AGACACGTGC-3′ from −233 to −224 as shown in Fig. 4 A. These two sites are separated by an 18-nucleotide spacer (Fig. 4 A). Each site has only one and two mismatched nucleotides, respectively, compared with the published consensus sequence. To confirm whether this p53 binding element is responsible for conferring stimulation to the c-met gene promoter, a copy of the 63 base pair DNA fragment (−278 to −216) containing the p53 binding motif was inserted upstream of the minimal promoter element of the E1BCAT plasmid (Fig.4 A) and cotransfected with wild-type p53 expression plasmid. Cotransfection of the wild-type p53 expression vector dramatically stimulated promoter activity of two independently prepared plasmid constructs by more than 20-fold (p53-E1BCAT clones 1 and 2) (Fig.4 B). The extent of stimulation of the heterologous promoter by the 63-bp DNA fragment containing the c-met p53 binding site was comparable to that of the RGC-W-3X sequence containing three copies of a p53 consensus binding site (positive control) (Fig.4 B). The promoter activity of the E1BCAT control vector lacking the p53 binding site (negative control) was not affected by expression of wild-type p53 (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the DNA fragment (−278 to −216) containing the putative c-met p53 binding element is responsible for p53-mediated stimulation of mouse c-met gene promoter activity, and the identified p53 binding element is functional. Alignment of the mouse c-met promoter nucleotide sequence with that of the human indicates that the p53 binding site is well conserved between the two species (Fig.5).Figure 5Nucleotide sequence comparison of the mouse and human c-met 5′-flanking region. Nucleotide sequence alignment of the mouse and human c-met promoter regions (GenBank accession numbers AF030200 and AC002080, respectively) were carried out using the DNASTAR alignment software. The 10-bp p53 binding sites are boxed and marked as I andII, respectively. The asterisks indicate identical nucleotides shared between species (m, mouse;h, human). The arrow indicates the transcription start site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To directly show the interaction of p53 protein and the c-met p53 response element, EMSAs were performed. The 63-bp DNA fragment (−278 to −216) containing the c-met p53 binding element was used as a probe, and the purified recombinant p53 core domain protein was used in the binding reaction. It is known that p53 contains 393 amino acids and is divided into three functional domains: amino acids 1–101 for transactivation by interacting with the basal transcriptional machinery, amino acids 102–292 for sequence-specific DNA binding, and amino acids 293–393 for oligomerization. The DNA binding specificity of the core domain protein is comparable to the full-length wild-type p53 protein (33Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). As we expected, the mobility of the labeled probe DNA was shifted by p53 core domain protein (Fig. 6, lane 2) and formed a binding complex. The shifted complex was diminished by increasing amounts of self-competitor as well as a wild-type consensus p53 binding site (lanes 3,4, and 7) but not by nonspecific competitor (lanes 5 and 6). When the wild-type consensus p53 binding site was used as a probe, it specifically bound to the p53 core domain protein (lanes 9 and10 as positive control). These results demonstrate that p53 protein directly binds to the identified c-met p53 response elements to exert p53-mediated stimulation of the c-met gene promoter. We were interested to know whether p53 plays a role in regulating the expression of the endogenous c-met gene. We used RKO cells that express wild-type p53 and RKO cells that have been stably transfected either with a dominant negative mutant form of p53 or with viral E6 protein to impair p53 function. In this system, it is well documented that p53 expression is up-regulated after UV irradiation, resulting in the induction of its down stream target genes such as p21WAF1/CIP1 only in the parental RKO cell line, which has a functional wild-type p53 (27Smith M.L. Chen I. Zhan Q. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1053-1059PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, c-Met expression is up-regulated in RKO cells having a functional wild-type p53 protein within 3 h after UV light exposure. Similarly, the well known target of p53, p21WAF/CIP1 protein, is also induced. In contrast, RKO cells transfected with mutant p53 or the viral E6 gene, which inactivates wild-type p53 protein, fail to show induction of c-Met and p21WAF1/CIP1 proteins. These results suggest that wild-type p53 is important in the up-regulation of c-Met under these experimental conditions. p53 has been demonstrated to function as an important regulator of cell proliferation in response to certain stimuli such as DNA damage (34Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T. Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar, 35Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J. Morris R.G. Bird C.C. Hooper M.L. Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 849-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Despite the progress achieved toward understanding p53 functions, the molecular mechanisms by which p53 acts as a key regulator of cell growth and tumorigenesis are still unclear. Studies have demonstrated that p53 functions as a transcription factor and regulates a number of target genes at the transcriptional level. The central region of the p53 protein interacts with the promoter of target genes in a sequence-specific manner, binding to two copies of a consensus element (5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3′) (32El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). While wild-type p53 is a transactivator of the promoters containing a p53 binding motif, various tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 protein are defective in sequence-specific transactivation. Among the genes that are positively influenced by p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Bax, human transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGF-BP 3), and cyclin G are well known regulators of cell growth and differentiation (36El-Deiry W.S.

Cell Res. 1997; 230: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). c-Met is the protein tyrosine kinase cell surface receptor for HGF and transmits its multiple signals such as induction of cell growth, differentiation, and the apoptotic/antiapoptotic processes (8Bardelli A. Longati P. Albero D. Goruppi S. Schneider C. Ponzetto C. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6205-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 42Conner E.A Wirth P.J Kiss A. Santoni-Rugiu E. Thorgeirsson S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). c-Met also plays an important role in tumor growth and progression (14Giordano S. Ponzetto C. Di Renzo M.F. Cooper C.S. Comoglio P.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 15Ponzetto C. Giordano S. Peverali F. Della Valle G. Abate M.L. Vaula G.

Studies of c-met gene expression regulation are important in understanding its biological functions in normal and abnormal tissue growth. Previously, we have cloned and characterized the c-met gene promoter (24Seol D.-W. Zarnegar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence analysis identified a potential p53 regulatory element in the promoter. To determine whether p53 regulates expression of the c-metgene, we examined the ability of p53 to regulate c-met gene promoter activity by cotransfection of the c-met gene promoter construct and expression vectors encoding wild-type or tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 in a p53 mutant cell line, C-33A. Cotransfection assays demonstrated that c-met gene promoter activity is stimulated by wild-type p53 (Fig. 1). Unlike some p53 target gene promoters, which have been shown to be transactivated by tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 (“gain of function” activity) (37Ludes-Meyers J.H. Subler M.A. Shivakumar C.V. Munoz R.M. Jiang P. Bigger J.E. Brown D.R. Deb S.P. Deb S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6009-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), c-met gene promoter activity was not affected by various p53 mutants (Fig. 1). In addition, the stimulatory effect of p53 on the c-met gene promoter was dependent upon the input dose of p53 expression plasmid (Fig. 1 C). Doses ranging from 0.25 to 1.5 μg of p53 expression plasmid led to a continuous increase of p53-mediated stimulation. Maximal stimulation was reached at a dose of 1.5 μg of p53 expression plasmid and was slightly repressed at higher doses. It has been reported that p53 interacts with TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and interferes with the binding of TBP to the TATA box (43Martin D.W. Munoz R.M. Subler M.A. Deb S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13062-13067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that, at a higher dose, p53 may sequester TBP and prevent its interaction with TFIID, which is required for the initiation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. p53-mediated stimulatory activity in the mouse c-metpromoter was mapped to the region −278 to −216 by functional analysis (Figs. 2 and 3). These functional analysis results are in agreement with results of nucleotide sequence analysis of the c-metgene promoter. The potential p53 binding element identified within −278 to −216 contains two 10-bp p53 binding sites (5′-GGACAAACCT-3′ and 5′-AGACACGTGC-3′) separated by 18 base pairs (Fig. 1 A). These sites contain only one and two nucleotide mismatches, respectively, compared with the published consensus p53 binding site, 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3′ (32El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that at least two copies of the 10-base pair p53 binding site, separated by 0–13 base pairs, are required for high affinity p53 binding (32El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar), and the number of intervening nucleotides is not absolutely crucial. It is of interest to note that the p53 binding element is well conserved between the mouse and human c-met promoters (Fig. 5). The extent of stimulation of the heterologous promoter by one copy of the DNA fragment (−278 to −216) containing the c-met p53 binding element was highly comparable to that produced by the RGC-W-3X-CAT containing three copies of the consensus p53 binding element (Fig. 4). Moreover, the purified DNA binding domain of p53 protein strongly and specifically bound to the c-met p53 response element in EMSA (Fig. 6). p53 has been shown to interact with other transcription factors such as Sp1 and MDM-2 (44Gualberto A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 19680-19683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 45Oliner J. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). As shown by nucleotide sequence analysis (24Seol D.-W. Zarnegar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the c-met gene promoter is highly GC-rich. We identified two Sp1 binding sites (5′-GGGCGG-3′) in the c-met gene promoter and demonstrated that Sp1 transcription factor is critically involved in transcriptional regulation of the c-met gene promoter (24Seol D.-W. Zarnegar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that p53 also regulates the c-met gene promoter activity by cooperatively interacting with Sp1. As the “guardian of the genome,” p53 is an important component of the DNA damage-inducible response. It is activated by genotoxic agents such as UV irradiation and then transactivates other genes to induce DNA repair and cell survival (27Smith M.L. Chen I. Zhan Q. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1053-1059PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiment, we observed that the endogenous c-met gene product is induced after UV exposure, correlating with the expression of p53 and its target p21WAF1/CIP1. However, when wild-type p53 function was impaired by a mutant form of p53 or by viral E6 protein, induction of the p53 target gene p21WAF1/CIP1 as well as c-Met was abolished. These results demonstrate for the first time that c-Met is induced by UV light and that p53 plays a role in this activation process. Although p53 is a transcription factor that serves a dual role in the regulation of cell proliferation, it is most recognized for its cell cycle arrest and apoptotic activity. As stated previously, HGF/c-Met is a multifunctional system that is involved in growth control and differentiation. HGF/c-Met inhibits the growth of some normal and tumor cells (20Tajima H. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Santoni-Rugiu E. Preisegger K.H. Kiss A. Audolfsson T. Shiota G. Schmidt E.V. Thorgeirsson S.S.

Weiss M.C. Comoglio P.M. Tripodi M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and the level of expression of HGF and c-Met correlates with the degree of cell differentiation (31Chen Q.Y. DeFrances M.C. Zarnegar R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 821-832PubMed Google Scholar). c-Met is underexpressed in human breast carcinomas that harbor a mutant form of p53 (46Moghul A. Lin L. Beedle A. Kanbour-Shakir A. DeFrances M.C. Liu Y. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2045-2052PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that c-Met may cooperate with wild-type p53 to negatively regulate cell growth and induce differentiation. Experiments have demonstrated that wild-type p53 transactivates the genes encoding EGFR and TGF-α, which are known to positively modulate cell proliferation (37Ludes-Meyers J.H. Subler M.A. Shivakumar C.V. Munoz R.M. Jiang P. Bigger J.E. Brown D.R. Deb S.P. Deb S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6009-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 39Shin T.H. Paterson A.J.

It is also interesting to note that the HGF promoter was recently reported to be transcriptionally activated by p53 (51Metcalfe A.M.J. Dixon R.M. Radda G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that wild-type p53 plays a role in controlling the expression of both c-Met and its ligand, HGF, ultimately leading to regulation of cell growth and differentiation.

However, positive identification of biological ligands that directly and noncovalently modulate their activity has been elusive. This study demonstrates a high affinity inhibition of connexin channels by the purine cyclic monophosphates cAMP and cGMP. Purified homomeric connexin-32 and heteromeric connexin-32/connexin-26 channels were inhibited by exposure to nanomolar levels of the nucleotides prior to incorporation into membranes. Access to the site of action, or affinity for the nucleotides, was greatly reduced following incorporation of the connexin channels into membranes, where inhibition required millimolar concentrations of the nucleotides. The high affinity inhibition did not occur with similar concentrations of AMP, ADP, ATP, cTMP, or cCMP. This is the first report of a direct ligand effect on connexin channel function. The high affinity and specificity of the inhibition suggest a biological role in control of connexin channels and also may lead to the application of affinity reagents to study of connexin channel structure-function.

The gating of connexin channels by ligands is a key uncharacterized element of intercellular signaling. Connexin channels mediate intercellular molecular signaling that is important in developmental and physiological contexts (1Lo C.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2Loewenstein W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 560: 1-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 3Warner A.E. Guthrie S.C. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, the biological ligands that directly regulate connexin channel activity have been difficult to positively identify. Direct action on connexin channels is difficult to establish due to the intercellular channel structure and the cytoplasmic location of channel modulatory sites. Junctional coupling between cells can be reduced by exposure of cells to various compounds (reviewed in Refs. 4Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 5Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B.

Landes, New York1994: 195-215Google Scholar). In some cases, it is known that the effects on junctional conductance are not due to direct action of the applied compounds on the connexin channels, but to cytoplasmic mediators (e.g. kinases, cf.

However, in most cases the mechanism of action, and whether it is direct or indirect, is not known. The most well documented direct modulators of connexin channels are voltage (cf. Refs.8Spray D.C.

However, voltage is not likely to be a physiologically important regulator except in specific locations in excitable tissues. Cytoplasmic acidification causes most cells to uncouple, but this may not be a direct effect (14Nicholson B.J. Zhou L. Cao F. Zhu H. Chen Y. Werner R. Gap Junctions.

The identification of ligands of connexin channels is important for understanding the physiology of intercellular signaling. It is also important because it can lead to the use of affinity reagents to explore the structure-function of connexins. The biophysical study of connexin channels has been hindered by the absence of specific affinity reagents or toxins. Such agents (e.g. tetrodotoxin and charybdotoxin) have been vitally important in elucidating molecular mechanisms of other channels (17Miller C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 5-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 18Strichartz G. Annu. Rev.

Compounds that alter junctional coupling when applied to cells were tested for efficacy in a reconstituted system. A high affinity, modulatory action of purine cyclic monophosphates, but not other nucleotides, on connexin channel activity was discovered.

To ensure that the potential modulatory agents were available without dilution to the connexin until liposome formation, a 4 ml volume of buffer containing the agents was loaded onto the gel-filtration column before the liposome-forming solution was loaded. The procedure used to fractionate liposomes into two populations based on sucrose permeability is described and fully characterized in Harris et al. (32Harris A.L. Walter A. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Harris A.L. Walter A. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr.

A. 1974; 71: 1520-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Liposomes containing functional channels are separated from liposomes without functional channels by TSF achieved by centrifugation through an iso-osmotic density gradient formed by urea and sucrose solutions. Equilibration of extraliposomal and intraliposomal osmolytes is rapid (milliseconds for these 900-Å diameter liposomes). Therefore, even a channel that opens only infrequently for brief times will mediate full exchange of osmolytes and cause liposome movement to the characteristic lower position. The assay will not detect the activity of channels withP o less than 0.001, so this is effectively an all-or-none assay for channel function based on urea/sucrose permeability. The studies of cyclic nucleotide binding involve exposure of solubilized connexin channels to several ligand concentrations. The ligand is essentially locked in place by incorporation of the connexin into liposome membrane as detergent diffuses away during reconstitution, and its effect is assessed as a change in channel activity relative to controls without ligand. Therefore the channel activity gives a quantitative assessment of the fraction of channels to which ligand is bound at the moment of reconstitution in membranes—it is a “snapshot” of binding. In this way, it is formally analogous to a standard binding assay in which one assesses the average fraction of receptors occupied for a given concentration of ligand. The process is irreversible after reconstitution up to the lifetime of functional channels in the liposomes (∼4 weeks). Rather than looking at the aggregate response of a population of receptors while association-dissociation reactions take place, this assay captures those associations at a given instant. Thus, an irreversible reaction (incorporation into a bilayer) is used to freeze a reversible reaction (ligand binding) under steady-state conditions. For each preparation of connexin, the percentage of liposomes in the lower band of TSF data was normalized to the maximum value obtained for that preparation. This enabled comparison of modulatory effects across reconstitutions that produced different amounts of channel activity (fractions of liposomes with functional channels). Where several preparations were used, normalized data sets were combined for calculation of means and standard errors. Previous work with the TSF system suggested that the channels distribute among the liposomes in a manner described by the Poisson distribution (28Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For a given protein-lipid ratio (λ) in the liposomes, a Poisson distribution accounts for the fraction of the liposomes that have functional channels. A statistical method was used to correct for the fraction of liposomes that contained more than one channel (described in the companion paper (33Lehninger A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1520-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)). This calculation compensates for the underestimate of the effect of a test compound introduced by some of liposomes containing more than one channel, transforming the fraction of permeable liposomes in a population to accurately reflect discrete single channel activities. Connexin was immunopurified from rodent liver using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes connexin-32. Previous biochemical and functional studies have characterized connexin purified in this way from rat liver as homomeric Cx32 hemichannels, and that from mouse liver as heteromeric Cx32/Cx26 hemichannels (28Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol.

American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1994: 197-224Google Scholar). The sensitivities of channels formed by Cx32 and Cx32/Cx26 to several agents were explored and compared by transport-specific fractionation (TSF) of liposomes. TSF has been well characterized (32Harris A.L. Walter A. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Harris A.L. Walter A.

IOS Press, Amsterdam1997: 60-64Google Scholar) and effectively used in studies of channel permeability (28Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17981-17987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified connexin is incorporated into unilamellar liposomes by gel filtration of a mixture of octylglucoside-solubilized connexin and lipid. TSF fractionates the liposomes on the basis of permeation of osmolytes (urea and sucrose) through the reconstituted channels. Specifically, it employs buoyant density sedimentation to separate into distinct bands liposomes with open channels permeable to urea and sucrose from liposomes that are without such channels. Liposomes that do not contain open connexin channels (i.e., are not permeable to urea and sucrose) migrate to an equilibrium position in the upper part of the gradient. For liposomes that contain open connexin channels, the osmolytes exchange through the channels and the liposomes migrate to a lower position determined only by lipid density. Any significant channel open probability (P o) results in sufficient osmolyte exchange to cause the required change in density. The TSF is therefore an all-or-none assay of per-liposome channel activity. Effects of test compounds on channel activity were assessed by exposing connexin or connexin-containing liposomes to the compounds prior to or during a TSF spin. Effects on channel activity were quantified as changes in the fraction of liposomes in the lower band relative to that for connexin or liposomes not exposed to the test compound. The fractional change in distribution of liposomes between the two bands is a quantitative measure of the fractional change in activity of the population of the channels. The change in liposome density can result from brief channel openings, so only whenP o changes above or below a low threshold value are changes in channel activity detected by TSF. In initial studies, the effects of test compounds were assessed by including them in the TSF solutions. The results are for both homomeric Cx32 channels and heteromeric Cx32/Cx26 channels, except where otherwise indicated. Table I lists compounds that can affect junctional ionic current or dye transfer when applied to cells but that were without effect in this system. TablesII, III, and IV list additional compounds that were also without detectable effect. Absence of effect indicates that the actions of a compound on connexin channels either (a) are not direct, (b) are not dramatic enough to be detected by TSF, or (c) require the intercellular channel structure (two end-to-end hexameric hemichannels).Table ICompounds affecting junctional coupling in cells that did not have effects on connexin channel activity in the TSF systemCompoundConcentrationGlycerrhetinic acid1 μmHalothane1 mmHeptanol1 mmHeptanoic acid1 mmOctanol1 mmOctanoic acid1 mmMelatonin10−8mQuinine10−5m Open table in a new tab Table IICompounds that inhibit other ion channels that were without effect on connexin channels in the TSF systemCompoundConcentrationKnown primarily as blocker ofFlufenamic acid80 μmChloride channels40 μmIon antiporters5-(N,N-Hexamethylene)-amiloride · HClLidocaine1 mmSodium and potassium channelsTetramethylammonium10 mmPotassium channelsTetraethylammonium10 mmPotassium channelsTetraproylammonium10 mmPotassium channelsTetrabutylammonium10 mmPotassium channelsTetrapentylammonium10 mmPotassium channels Open table in a new tab Table IIIDivalent ions without effect on connexin channels in the TSF systemIonConcentrationmmCa2+1Co2+0.2SO42−5 Open table in a new tab Table IVMiscellaneous compounds without effect on connexin channels in the TSF systemCompoundaOther compounds that were tested but that caused aggregation of liposomes or had other effects that made the results difficult to determine were 5 μm gossypol, 0.2 mm Mn2+, 1 mm Ni2+, and 1 mm Zn2+.ConcentrationDescriptionmmDimethylpimelimidate10–100Cross-linking reagentDithiothreitol5Reducing agentSucrose octaacetate10Acylated analog of sucrosea Other compounds that were tested but that caused aggregation of liposomes or had other effects that made the results difficult to determine were 5 μm gossypol, 0.2 mm Mn2+, 1 mm Ni2+, and 1 mm Zn2+. Open table in a new tab However, positive findings in this system indicate dramatic effects on channel activity. When applied at 10 mm, but not 1 mm, to reconstituted hemichannels, cAMP inhibited channel activity (Fig. 1). Activity was not affected by 10 mm adenine or adenosine. By cytoplasmic standards, 10 mm is a high concentration of cAMP, so a sensitivity in this range is not likely to be biological relevant. We speculated that an apparent low affinity for cAMP could arise from restricted accessibility to a high affinity site. This could occur if the binding site were partially obscured by membrane lipids or if the reconstituted channel was only rarely in a conformation that enabled access to the site. A high affinity interaction between cyclic nucleotides and connexin was established by studies in which connexin in lipid-detergent micelles was exposed to the nucleotides. In pilot studies of connexin channel permeation, connexin channels were exposed to low amounts of cAMP or cGMP as permeability tracers in the presence of detergent during liposome formation. Even though the nucleotides were present at only micromolar levels, channel activity after reconstitution was completely inhibited. This surprising effect was investigated further: immunopurified connexin was exposed to nucleotides while in detergent, then incorporated into liposomes, and channel activity was assessed. Exposure of purified connexin to as little as 1.5 nm cAMP or cGMP completely eliminated the channel activity of subsequently reconstituted Cx32 or Cx32/Cx26 channels. This inhibition was not reversible by increase of the salt in the TSF gradients to 100 mm, change of the TSF gradient pH to 5 or 9, or by omitting the nucleotides from the TSF gradient. Western blots established that the presence of cyclic nucleotides during reconstitution had no effect on incorporation of connexin into liposomes (Fig.2). The inhibition of channel activity is not due to the action of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase as there was none present, nor was there ATP or divalent cations. No effect was seen with 1.5 nm AMP, ADP, ATP, cTMP, or cCMP. Therefore this high affinity effect was specific for cyclic purine monophosphates (cPMPs). This is the first evidence of a modulatory high affinity binding site for a second messenger on connexin channels. Dose-response data of the cPMP effect were obtained by performing reconstitutions using aliquots from a detergent-solubilized lipid and connexin mixture containing different concentrations of cyclic nucleotide (either cAMP or cGMP). The Hill equation was fitted to the dose/response data (Fig. 3). Homomeric Cx32 showed essentially identical high affinity inhibition by both cAMP (K d = 0.106 nm;n Hill = 2.1) and cGMP (K d = 0.108 nm; n Hill = 1.5). For heteromeric Cx32/Cx26 channels, cAMP effects were higher affinity and somewhat less cooperative (K d = 0.054 nm; n Hill = 1.1) than cGMP effects (K d = 0.15 nm;n Hill = 1.6). The homomeric Cx32 channels have affinities for the two cyclic nucleotides intermediate to those of the Cx32/Cx26 channels. Exposure to 1.5 nm cyclic nucleotide fluorescent analogs 1,N 6-etheno-cAMP and 2′-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-cGMP or to the photoaffinity reagent 8-azido-cAMP during detergent solubilization also completely inhibited both homomeric Cx32 and heteromeric Cx32/Cx26 channel activity. Permeabilization of the liposome membranes by exposure to 5% Me2SO or to octylglucoside levels below the critical micelle concentration did not reverse the inhibition. Additionally, attempts to induce the inhibition in reconstituted channels not previously exposed to cyclic nucleotide by exposure of the liposomes to 10 μm cAMP or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (a hydrophobic analog of cAMP) in 5% Me2SO or octylglucoside levels below the critical micelle concentration were not successful. These experiments demonstrate the existence of a selective, high affinity modulatory site for cyclic purine monophosphates on connexin channels. The site is accessible while the protein is in micelles and/or during its transition from micellar to bilayer environments, and it becomes less accessible following incorporation of the channels into membranes. The inhibition of channel activity by cPMPs could be achieved by allosteric effects or physical occlusion of the pore. The latter is not likely because cPMPs can permeate reconstituted Cx32 channels (29Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The much-reduced sensitivity of reconstituted channels may indicate that after reconstitution the site is accessible only when the protein is in a restricted set of conditions or conformational states. Alternatively, the effects at millimolar levels could be due to a distinct, low affinity site unrelated to the effects at nanomolar levels. That activity inhibition persists in the absence of free nucleotide after reconstitution suggests that once ligand is bound and the channel is incorporated into a membrane, the ligand is precluded from dissociation. This may occur by conformational changes secondary to binding or to the transition to a membrane environment. Examples of the former include the binding-dependent conformational change that occurs in peptide binding by calmodulin (38Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A.

Alternatively, dissociation of ligand may be blocked by membrane lipids, where the bound ligand is shielded from the aqueous phase by the phospholipid bilayer following reconstitution.

Neurosci. 1984; 4: 2477-2488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as hemichannels (29Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), so the inhibition at subnanomolar levels may seem paradoxical. However, cytoplasmic concentrations of cyclic nucleotides range between nanomolar and micromolar, well below the millimolar levels required for effects on connexin channels already in membranes. Homomeric Cx32 and heteromeric Cx32/Cx26 have distinguishable but similar affinities for the nucleotides, suggesting that the binding sites for the nucleotides on the two connexins are different, but not dramatically so. The activity of the cyclic nucleotide analogs may be informative regarding the nature of the binding site. Because 1,N 6-etheno-cAMP and 8-azido-cAMP are derivatized on the purine ring, 2′-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-cGMP is derivatized on the ribose sugar, and all three are effective at nanomolar levels, it appears that additions to the 2, 8, N 6 and 2′-hydroxyl groups do not preclude steric fit into the putative binding site. Cyclic nucleotides directly modulate protein function in several systems. The most well known class is the catabolite activator protein (CAP) family of proteins, which includes the Escherichia coli CAP, cyclic-nucleotide dependent protein kinases, and cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channels (53Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Weber I.T. Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6122-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, Cx32 and Cx26 do not contain the amino acid sequences that are strictly conserved at the cyclic nucleotide binding domains of the CAP family. Neither is there obvious sequence similarity with the postulated cGMP binding domain of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases (55McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30671-30679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Unlike the CAP and phosphodiesterase families of cyclic nucleotide receptors, which have micromolar affinities, the cAR1 and cAR3 chemoattractant receptors of Dictyostelium have nanomolar affinities for cyclic nucleotides (56Johnson R.L. Van Haastert P.J.M. Kimmel A.R. Saxe C.L. Jastorff B. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4600-4607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the same range that we determined for connexins, and mediate physiological responses at subnanomolar levels (57Van Haastert P.J.M. Experientia. 1995; 51: 1144-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Further analogy with the cAR family is provided by our finding that 2′-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-cGMP is just as effective as cGMP, suggesting that substitutions at the ribose 2′-OH position do not interfere with binding to connexin. An unsubstituted ribose 2′-OH group is required for binding of cGMP by the CAP family of receptors (58Francis S.H. Thomas M.K. Corbin J.D. Beavo J. Houslay M.D. Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases: Structure, Regulation and Drug Action. John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. Chichester, 1990: 118-140Google Scholar) but not for cAR1 (59Van Haastert P.J.M. Kien E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9636-9642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) The amino acids involved in the cyclic nucleotide binding to cAR1 have not yet been identified. However, a region of 26 amino acids (148–173), thought to control access to the binding pocket (60Kim J.-Y. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28724-28731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Kim J.-Y. Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Lin K.C. Borleis J.A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2060-2068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), shows ∼25% identity and ∼60% homology with a region of Cx32 and Cx26 that spans the cytoplasmic loop and the third transmembrane domain. The same level of identity and homology extends through the eight positions N-terminal to this sequence before dropping off. This sequence similarity is only suggestive; further analogy with the cAR family must await positive identification of the relevant amino acids. Hill coefficients of between 1 and 2 for the cPMP effects suggest that there could be two independent binding sites or more than two cooperative sites per channel. Because all six Cx32 subunits comprising a homomeric hemichannel have identical sequences, there are potentially six binding sites per hemichannel. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the sites of action are within the pore and altered by the micelle-membrane transition. The fact that connexin channels have subnanomolar specific affinities for cAMP and cGMP, and that binding of these cyclic nucleotides closes connexin channels, is likely to be of physiological importance. One possible function is to keep hemichannels closed while they are in Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The binding site may be accessible during initial membrane insertion and/or channel assembly, when cytoplasmic cPMPs could bind and thus ensure that connexin hemichannels remain closed during trafficking to the plasma membrane. Docking of apposed hemichannels to form the full intercellular channel could cause dissociation of these nucleotides from connexin channels. Connexin-32 is co-translationally inserted into endoplasmic reticulum membrane (62Falk M.M. Buehler L.K. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2703-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 63Zhang J.T. Chen M.G. Foote C.I. Nicholson B.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, it has been shown that during co-translational insertion of polytopic membrane proteins, the transmembrane segments inserted through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane are stabilized in a salt-accessible compartment, apparently not interacting directly with lipid (64Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 65Hanein D. Matlack K.E.S. Jungnickel B. Plath K. Kallies K. Miller K. Rapoport T.A. Akey C. Cell. 1996; 87: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, regions of a folded membrane protein that will be later blocked from aqueous access by membrane lipid appear to be transiently accessible to cytoplasmic components. In view of this, we favor the view that both the micellar environment in our experiments and the partially unfolded state of the protein as it is inserted into a bilayer renders the cPMP site(s) accessible. NMR studies show that nondenaturing detergent such that used in these studies increase molecular motion of and accessibility to protein domains that are exposed to lipid when in bilayers (66Stopar D. Spruijt R.B. Wolfs C.J. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15467-15473Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 67Kálmán L. Gajda T. Sebban P. Maróti P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Specifically, there is particularly enhanced accessibility to residues at the membrane-water transition (68Spruijt R.B. Wolfs C.J. Verver J.W. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10383-10391Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 69Stopar D. Spruijt R.B. Wolfs C.J. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12268-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). There is evidence that nondenaturing detergents do not fully coat the hydrophobic surfaces of proteins (unlike SDS), leaving a somewhat open structure (70Makino S. Woolford Jr., J.L. Tanford C. Webster R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4327-4332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 71Cavalieri S.J. Goldthwait D.A. Neet K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 102: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) accessible to small, hydrophilic ligands. Furthermore, the predicted number of residues for connexin transmembrane helices suggests that the hydrophobic core of the protein is relatively short, composed of five helical turns (28 Å) (72Yeager M.J. Gilula N.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 929-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) rather than the six or more typical of channel proteins (73). There may be special lipid requirements for connexin channels in cell membranes to accommodate this. The lipid environment in the present studies is different from that in cell membranes, and may occlude sites that are accessible in them. Differences in the lipid environment may affect accessibility to binding sites, as well as other aspects of channel function (74Zanello L.P. Aztiria E. Antollini S.S. Barrantes F.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2155-2164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 75Reynolds J.A. Jost P.C. Griffith O.H. Lipid-Protein Interactions.

One is the identification and mechanisms of biological ligands that control connexin channel activity. The other is the identification of specific affinity reagents with which to probe the structure-function of connexin channels. These new findings, showing that connexin channels can be directly regulated by a cytoplasmic ligand, are likely to lead to structure-function studies of connexin channels and better understanding of the molecular basis for regulation of intercellular signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2054007990,"By using a rapid procedure of isolation of microsomes, we have shown that the liver glucose-6-phosphatase activity was lowered by about 30% (p < 0.001) after refeeding for 360 min rats previously unfed for 48 h, whereas the amount of glucose-6-phosphatase protein was not lowered during the same time. The amount of the regulatory subunit (p85) and the catalytic activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) were higher by a factor of 2.6 and 2.4, respectively (p < 0.01), in microsomes from refed as compared with fasted rats. This resulted from a translocation process because the total amount of p85 was the same in the whole liver homogenates from fasted and refed rats. The amount of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) was also higher by a factor of 2.6 in microsomes from refed rats (p < 0.01). Microsome-bound IRS1 was only detected in p85 immunoprecipitates. These results strongly suggest that an insulin-triggered mechanism of translocation of PI3K onto microsomes occurs in the liver of rats during refeeding. This process, via the lipid products of PI3K, which are potent inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphatase (Mithieux, G., Danièle, N., Payrastre, B., and Zitoun, C. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17–19), may account for the inhibition of the enzyme and participate to the inhibition of hepatic glucose production occurring in this situation. By using a rapid procedure of isolation of microsomes, we have shown that the liver glucose-6-phosphatase activity was lowered by about 30% (p < 0.001) after refeeding for 360 min rats previously unfed for 48 h, whereas the amount of glucose-6-phosphatase protein was not lowered during the same time.

Chem. 273, 17–19), may account for the inhibition of the enzyme and participate to the inhibition of hepatic glucose production occurring in this situation. Glucose-6 phosphatase (Glc6Pase) 1The abbreviations used are: Glc6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PI3, 4,5P3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. is a crucial enzyme in systemic glucose homeostasis. By catalyzing the dephosphorylation of glucose 6-phosphate (Glc6P), e.g. the last biochemical reaction of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, it allows the gluconeogenic tissues (liver and kidney) to release glucose in blood (1Nordlie R.C. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 53-152Google Scholar). Numerous data have been recently provided suggesting that Glc6Pase is an important regulatory factor of glucose production by the liver and the kidney in various physiological situations through mechanisms involving either gene expression (2Maitra S.R.

Danièle N. Bordet J.C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2727-2732PubMed Google Scholar, recently reviewed in Ref. 10Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the Glc6Pase activity during the postprandial period was suggested more than 10 years ago (11Newgard C.B. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This inhibition has remained uncertain for a long time because the biochemical evidence for the inhibition of the enzyme activity in the test tube was lacking. A significant breakthrough has been recently achieved, as we have shown that the Glc6Pase activity, assayed in the homogenates from rat livers freeze-clamped in situ, is inhibited for a few h after refeeding (9Minassian C. Danièle N. Bordet J.C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2727-2732PubMed Google Scholar). Other indirect data have strongly suggested that hyperinsulinemia, associated or not to hyperglycemia, should be the key signaling factor in the inhibition mechanism (10Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12Minassian C. Tarpin S. Mithieux G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Gardner L.B. Liu Z. Barret E.J. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1614-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the inhibition was not observed in the liver homogenates from rats perfused with insulin, whereas euglycemia was maintained by glucose perfusion (9Minassian C. Danièle N. Bordet J.C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2727-2732PubMed Google Scholar). This might be explained because the latter conditions dramatically differ from the physiological ones. We have therefore chosen to study the mechanism of inhibition of Glc6Pase under physiological conditions of hyperinsulinemia, e.g. during the refeeding of rats previously unfed for 48 h (9Minassian C. Danièle N. Bordet J.C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2727-2732PubMed Google Scholar). A key feature of this mechanism is its lability because the inhibition was not retained in isolated microsomes in any study (6Bode A.M. Foster J.D. Nordlie R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2860-2863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Minassian C. Danièle N. Bordet J.C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2727-2732PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mithieux G. Eur. J.

This was a serious hindrance to the elucidation of the mechanism at the molecular level. Our first aim has, thus, been to design a purification procedure of microsomes retaining the inhibited state of the enzyme. In parallel, we have wished to assess the hypothesis that the inhibition of Glc6Pase could be dependent on the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). There is indeed growing evidence suggesting that PI3K is a crucial enzyme in the signal transduction of insulin to glucose metabolism in the liver and in peripheral tissues (see Refs. 14Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar and 15Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. O'Rahilly S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 17: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar as reviews). Suggesting a role for PI3K in the control of Glc6Pase activity, we have recently shown that the enzyme is specifically inhibited in vitro in the presence of μm amounts of the lipid products of PI3K (16Mithieux G. Danièle N. Payrastre B. Zitoun C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In adipocytes, it has been strongly suggested that the specificity of insulin to stimulate glucose transport is dependent on the intracellular targeting of PI3K to low density microsomes (17Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. Chen K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem.

J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Given the intracellular location of Glc6Pase in the liver endoplasmic reticulum (which is not explained at the present time), the hypothesis that a similar PI3K translocation process could be involved in the Glc6Pase inhibition seems therefore especially attractive. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (IFFA CREDO, L'Arbresle, France) weighing 230–240 g were housed for 3 days with free access to water and rat chow (50% starch, 23.5% proteins, 5% lipids, 4% cellulose, 5.5% mineral salts, 12% water (weight basis), Unité d'Alimentation Rationnelle, Epinay/Orge, France). Fasted rats were then deprived of food for 48 h with free access to water. After the same fasting time, refed rats were given free access to rat chow (see above) for 360 min (9Minassian C. Danièle N. Bordet J.C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2727-2732PubMed Google Scholar). The results were obtained from several sets of experiments. Each set involved one control group of three fasted rats and one group of three refed rats processed the same day. Unfed and refed rats were anesthetized by a single injection of pentobarbital (7 mg/100 g of body weight). Once they were asleep, the abdomen was incised to expose the liver. A small liver lobe (about 2 g) was cut and immediately homogenized at 4 °C in 18 ml of 10 mm Hepes, 0.25% sucrose, pH 7.3, using a Teflon glass homogenizer. The homogenate was rapidly centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 30,000 ×g to pellet all dense intracellular vesicles (20Ajzannay A. Minassian C. Riou J.P. Mithieux G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Microsomes were further extracted from the supernatant by one centrifugation step for 30 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in 1.8 ml of the Hepes/sucrose buffer and was immediately used for Glc6Pase and PI3K assays. Using this procedure, less than 1 h was spent between the removal of the liver lobe and the enzyme assays. In some experiments, a further fractionation of microsomal membranes in sucrose gradient was performed according to the method described by Aronson and Touster (21Aronson Jr., N.N. Touster O. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The rest of the microsomes were frozen and kept at −80 °C for subsequent determination of protein and Western blotting analyses. In some experiments, microsomes were also isolated according to the classical procedure described in our previous papers (4Minassian C. Zitoun C. Mithieux G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 155: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Minassian C. Ajzannay A. Riou J.P. Mithieux G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16585-16588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glc6Pase was assayed after rapid fractionation by complex formation of Pi produced from Glc6P. Briefly, the microsome suspension was diluted 50 times in 10 mm Hepes, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.3, and 100 μl (about 30 μg) of protein were added to a 500-μl (total volume) incubation medium composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 or 20 mm Glc6P, pH 7.4. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of ascorbic acid/trichloroacetic acid (2%/10%, mass/vol), and Pi was determined as described (5Mithieux G. Vidal H. Zitoun C. Bruni N. Danièle N. Minassian C. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Minassian C. Ajzannay A. Riou J.P. Mithieux G. J. Biol.

PI3K was assayed essentially as described previously (22Payrastre B. Nievers M. Boonstra J. Breton M. Verkleij A. Van Bergen Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5078-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, 5 μl of the suspension of microsomes (about 75 μg of proteins) were diluted in a 70-μl incubation medium (total volume) composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEDTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm vanadate, 50 μm ATP (20 μCi [γ -32P]ATP), 15 μg of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (Sigma) and 30 μg of phosphatidylserine (Sigma), pH 7.3. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C under agitation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, vol:vol). Phospholipids were extracted and deacylated, and [32P]glycerophosphoinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate was quantified by HPLC technique as described previously (23Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Payrastre B. Gironcel D. Plantavid M. Mauco G. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 5′-Nucleotidase was determined according to a previously published procedure (21Aronson Jr., N.N. Touster O. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum against rat Glc6Pase was obtained by injection of a synthetic peptide matching the 14 amino acids of the C terminal end of Glc6Pase sequence (CLARLLGQTHKKSL) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the regulatory subunit (p85) of rat PI3K and a rabbit immunopurified IgG fraction raised against rat insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) were obtained from Euromedex (Souffelweyersheim, France). Microsomal proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on 9% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore S.A., St. Quentin sur Yvelines, France). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with either anti-Glc6Pase antiserum (1:500 dilution), anti-PI3K antiserum (1:1000), or anti-IRS1 IgG (1:1000) followed by incubation with a pure goat-IgG fraction directed against rabbit IgG and linked to peroxydase (1:10000) (Sigma). The detection was performed using a specichrom-chemiluminescence system (Speci S.A., Ste-Foy-les-Lyon, France) with ECL-hyperfilms from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein was assayed according to the procedure of Lowry with bovine serum albumin as a standard in all experiments (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of membrane subfractions from sucrose gradients, which were assayed according to the Bradford procedure with the same standard (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test for unpaired data (27Winer B.J. International Student Ed Statistical Principles in Experimental Design. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1970Google Scholar). The challenging problem in studying the molecular mechanism of Glc6Pase inhibition after refeeding was to achieve the isolation of microsomes with Glc6Pase retaining its inhibited state. In a first approach, we tried to homogenize the liver and purify the microsomes in the presence of insulin mimetics such as orthovanadate and its powerful derived compounds, i.e. aqueous bisperoxovanadate and bisperoxovanadium picolinate. Unfortunately, this approach could not be used because, after homogenization of the liver in the presence of either of the vanadate compounds, Glc6Pase activity was revealed to be unstable and to decrease progressively with time, even if the inhibitors were rapidly removed upon washing microsomes (not shown). Therefore, we tried to obviate the problem of the lability of Glc6Pase inhibition by using a rapid procedure of extraction of microsomes from the liver homogenates (see “Materials and Methods”). Using this approach, we demonstrated that microsomal Glc6Pase activity was inhibited after refeeding, when it was assayed at low concentration (1 mm) of substrate (65 ± 2 versus 96.5 ± 3 nmol/min/mg of protein (33% inhibition)) and at high concentration (20 mm) of substrate (225 ± 6versus 306 ± 9 nmol/min/mg of protein (26% inhibition (see Fig. 1))). This was in good agreement with our previous results involving Glc6Pase assays in the homogenates from livers freeze-clampedin situ in anesthetized refed rats (9Minassian C. Danièle N. Bordet J.C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2727-2732PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition was because of an inhibition of the enzyme activity and not to a decrease in the amount of protein because there were no differences regarding to the amounts of immunoreactive 36-kDa protein (Glc6Pase), irrespective of the isolation procedure of microsomes or of the nutritional status of the animals (upper panel of Fig.1). This confirmed our previous data reporting that there was no detectable decrease in Glc6Pase activity after refeeding when the enzyme was assayed in microsomes isolated using the classical procedure (9Minassian C. Danièle N. Bordet J.C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2727-2732PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of this result, we were able to test the hypothesis that a mechanism of translocation of PI3K could be involved in the inhibition mechanism of Glc6Pase. In agreement with such a hypothesis, both the amount of immunoreactive p85 and the catalytic activity of PI3K were enhanced by 2.6 and 2.4 times, respectively, in the microsomes isolated from refed rats as compared with fasted rats (Fig.2, A and B). This increase was the consequence of a translocation process and not of a global increase in the amount of p85, because the amount of immunoreactive p85 in the homogenates from total livers was similar in refed rats and in fasted rats (Fig. 2 D). From microsomal protein recovery determinations and comparisons of the amounts of immunoreactive p85 in microsomes and homogenates, we could estimate that p85 bound to microsomes represented about 10–15% of total liver p85 in fasted rats and about 25–30% in refed rats. In 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells, it has been strongly suggested that the specificity of insulin to stimulate glucose transport is dependent on its ability to target PI3K to low density microsomes, from which glucose transporters translocate (18Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, platelet-derived growth factor, which does not stimulate glucose transport, mainly activates PI3K in the plasma membrane fraction (18Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that IRS1 could be the key transduction factor in this specificity of insulin to target PI3K to intracellular membranes (19Yang J. Clarke J.F. Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In agreement with such a specific PI3K-targeting pathway taking place in the liver during the postprandial period, the amount of immunoreactive IRS1 was increased by 2.6 in microsomes purified from refed rats as compared with fasted rats (Fig. 2 C). IRS1 and p85 bound to microsomes were present as a complex (Fig. 2 E), strongly suggesting that the presence of PI3K in microsomes was the result of an insulin-signaling process. Because microsomes isolated from the whole liver still contain a little proportion of contaminating plasma membranes (usually 10% of microsomal protein), we wished to ascertain that PI3K was associated to endoplasmic reticulum membranes and not only to the residual plasma membranes. Therefore, we further fractionated microsomal membranes in sucrose gradients. As shown in Fig. 3, p85 was present in all subfractions, either enriched in plasma membranes (fractions 2, 3, and 4 with high 5′-nucleotidase activity as a plasma membrane marker enzyme) or in endoplasmic reticulum (fractions 6 to 8, with high Glc6Pase activity). Because equal amounts of proteins from each fraction were loaded on the gel and because fractions 6 to8 contained high amounts of proteins as compared with the other fractions of the gradient (about 65% total microsomal protein), the distribution of p85 as studied in Fig. 3, which suggests that the amount of p85 could be rather low in these fractions, is misleading. In fact, we could calculate from densitometric measurements and protein concentrations that about 70% total microsomal p85 was associated to these Glc6Pase-enriched fractions in the liver from refed rats. Although the total amount of immunoreactive p85 was lower in microsomes from fasted rats (see Fig. 2 A), the repartition of p85 along the gradient was comparable with that in refed rats (not shown). This could be expected, assuming that IRS1 is the targeting factor of PI3K to intracellular membranes, because the ratio of immunoreactive IRS1 to immunoreactive p85 was similar in isolated microsomes from both fasted and refed rats (Fig. 2, A and C). Noteworthy, Glc6Pase activity was significantly lower in fractions6 to 8 (endoplasmic reticulum) from refed rats as compared with the corresponding fractions from fasted rats (Fig. 3). This suggested that the inhibition was stable after microsomes had been rapidly extracted from the liver homogenates. In contrast, it was not lower in fractions 2 to 4 (plasma membranes) in which a substantial proportion of Glc6Pase activity might be accounted for by the presence of nonspecific phosphatase activities such as alkaline phosphatase. It is now admitted that phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate and, more likely, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI3,4,5P3) are the key lipid metabolites of the PI3K-signaling pathway, because they are almost absent from resting cells, whereas their intracellular concentration substantially increases upon stimulation (29Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Previously, we performed reconstitution experiments of microsomes purified from fasted rats using our classical procedure in which Glc6Pase is fully active, with pure phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate and PI3,4,5P3. We have shown that Glc6Pase activity is inhibited in vitroin the presence of minute amounts of both D3-phosphoinositides (PI3,4,5P3 being the most efficient inhibitor) and not in the presence of various other phospholipids (16Mithieux G. Danièle N. Payrastre B. Zitoun C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To document in vivo that the products of translocated PI3K are the inducing factor in the Glc6Pase inhibition, we quantified PI3,4,5P3in microsomes from fasted and refed rats by two approaches. The one involved the metabolic labeling of the ATP pool by 32P in rats before refeeding experiments and the analysis of [32P]glycerophosphoinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate by HPLC (see “Materials and Methods”). The other involved the separation of phosphoinositides by thin layer chromatography and quantification of PI3,4,5P3 by densitometry. Unfortunately, neither approach allowed us evidence of a higher total PI3,4,5P3 content in microsomes from refed rats as compared with fasted rats (data not shown). Although this is not a positive result, we would like to point out that it does not exclude that PI3,4,5P3 is the inhibitor of Glc6Pase in refed rats. Indeed 1) the PI3,4,5P3 fraction bound to (and inhibiting) Glc6Pase should likely represent only a minor fraction from the total microsomal PI3,4,5P3 content; 2) the bulk microsomal PI3,4,5P3 content might have returned to its basal fasting level because of the action of counter-regulatory phosphoinositide phosphatases during the isolation procedure; 3) those PI3,4,5P3 molecules inhibiting Glc6Pase could be protected from the action of phosphoinositide phosphatases because of tight binding to the enzyme. We have previously suggested that the binding of the lipidic part of the PI3,4,5P3 molecule to some hydrophobic region of the enzyme is able to stabilize the enzyme-inhibitor interaction (16Mithieux G. Danièle N. Payrastre B. Zitoun C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One may thus hypothesize that this particular PI3,4,5P3 pool bound to Glc6Pase does return to basal level with a lengthened time course as compared with the bulk microsomal PI3,4,5P3 content. This might explain why the Glc6Pase inhibition did not decrease in parallel with the total inhibitor concentration as the isolation of microsomes was ongoing. Alternatively, the reversibility of the PI3,4,5P3-mediated Glc6Pase inhibition might involve the action of a regulatory molecule that is not present in rapidly isolated microsomes. That the Glc6Pase inhibition seemed stable in the endoplasmic reticulum after fractionation in sucrose gradients (Fig. 3) is in agreement with the latter proposal. To obtain another type of confirmation of the role of PI3K in the Glc6Pase inhibition in vivo, we carried out refeeding experiments with rats treated by intraperitoneal injections of wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K activity (15Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. O'Rahilly S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 17: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A similar approach was successfully used to inhibit skeletal muscle P70 S6 kinase by rapamycin in mice (30Chang P.Y. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Cheatham L.A. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29928-29935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Four injections (one every 2 h from 1 h before refeeding) were given at doses of 100 μg/kg by intraperitoneal injection. This represented a total dose close to the maximally tolerated daily dose in mice (31Schutz R.M. Merriman R.L. Andis S.L. Bonjouklian R. Grindey G.B. Rutherford P.G. Gallegos A. Massey K. Powis G. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 1135-1140PubMed Google Scholar). However, the liver microsomal PI3K activity was not substantially inhibited under thesein vivo conditions (by about 30% only, data not shown), and Glc6Pase activity was inhibited in wortmannin-treated refed rats as in control saline-injected refed rats (61 ± 4 versus63 ± 4 nmol/min/mg of protein at 1 mm Glc6P and 237 ± 16 versus 228 ± 2 nmol/min/mg of protein at 20 mm, respectively, compared with the results of Fig.1). Another attempt was made with LY294002, another specific inhibitor of PI3K (4 injections as above at 25 mg/kg/injection), which was also unsuccessful in relieving Glc6Pase activity from inhibition (not shown). Unfortunately, we could not obtain this additional confirmation for a role of PI3K in the control of Glc6Pase activity. Again, we would like to emphasize that this result is not counter to the basic proposition that PI3K is responsible for Glc6Pase inhibition. It is likely that a 30% inhibition only of PI3K activity might not be sufficient to alter the inhibition of Glc6Pase significantly. In addition, it cannot be excluded that the PI3K isotype involved in the control of Glc6Pase is insensitive to the inhibitors used in this work. PI3K species insensitive to one or both of these inhibitors have indeed been described (32Stack J.H. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Stephens L. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Jackson T. Volinia S. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Hawkins P.T. Curr.

J. 1996; 316: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A remaining important question is to know why Glc6Pase inhibition could only be evidenced in the most physiological situation of hyperinsulinemia, e.g. rats refed after a period of fasting and not in rats perfused with insulin (9Minassian C. Danièle N. Bordet J.C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2727-2732PubMed Google Scholar), whereas compelling indirect evidence has been provided that insulin inhibits hepatic glucose production by acting on Glc6Pase (10Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12Minassian C. Tarpin S. Mithieux G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Gardner L.B. Liu Z. Barret E.J. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1614-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This could be explained by a differential stability of Glc6Pase inhibition, which could be accounted for by the presence of a co-factor during refeeding experiments and its absence during insulin perfusion experiments. This might explain why isolated hepatocytes have often revealed a weakly suitable model to study the short term metabolic effects of insulin in the liver. We have previously discussed the possibility that some liver metabolite(s) dependent on nutrient availability could be required together with insulin for a full inhibition of Glc6Pase to take placein vivo (9Minassian C. Danièle N. Bordet J.C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2727-2732PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, recent results from us (35Guignot L. Mithieux G. Diabetologia. 1994; 39 Suppl. 1 (abstr.): 13Google Scholar) 2L. Guignot and G. Mithieux, submitted for publication. and others (36Mevorah M. Giacca A. Aharon Y. Hawkins M. Shamon H. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 744-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have emphasized the crucial role that hyperglycemia could play in the inhibition of the hepatic Glc6Pase flux in vivo. Efforts are ongoing to identify the putative factor(s) required for the inhibition mechanism of Glc6Pase under the action of insulin to be clearly demonstrated in a simplified experimental model. Such a demonstration in isolated hepatocytes, for example, would allow us to question the role of PI3K by means of PI3K inhibitors. In conclusion, we report the definitive demonstration in isolated microsomes that a mechanism of inhibition of Glc6Pase activity takes place in the liver of rats during the postprandial period. In addition, our results strongly suggest that this inhibition mechanism could be dependent on a translocation process of PI3K onto the liver endoplasmic reticulum membranes, a likely consequence of the activation of the insulin-signaling pathway, and mediated by the main lipid product of PI3K, e.g. PI3,4,5P3. Together with the recent reports that the targeting of PI3K to intracellular membranes could be a key mechanism in the activation of glucose transport by insulin in isolated adipocytes (15Shepherd P.R.

In the liver, they bring new insights into the mechanisms of control of hepatic glucose production at the level of Glc6Pase and the involvement of PI3K in these processes. They also provide a new rationale regarding the impairment of insulin in suppressing hepatic glucose production in insulin-resistant animals, because the IRS1-PI3K activation pathway is strongly altered in the liver of such animals (14Kahn C.R.

Ras activates the ERK cascade leading to phosphorylation of the transcription factors Elk-1 and Sap1a at the Ets/TCF site.

Here we have examined the role of the Ras and RhoA pathways in activation of the SRE and c-Fos expression in Rat-1 cells. Pertussis toxin and PD98059 strongly inhibited LPA-stimulated c-Fos expression and activation of a SRE:Luc reporter. C3 toxin completely inhibited RhoA function, partially inhibited SRE:Luc activity, but had no effect on LPA-stimulated c-Fos expression. Thus, in a physiological context the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, but not RhoA, is required for LPA-stimulated c-Fos expression in Rat-1 cells. C3 toxin stimulated the stress-activated protein kinases JNK and p38 and potentiated c-Jun expression and phosphorylation; these properties were shared by another cellular stress agonist the protein kinase C inhibitor Ro-31-8220. However, C3 toxin alone or in combination with growth factors did not stimulate AP-1:Luc activity and actually antagonized the synergistic activation of AP-1:Luc observed in response to co-stimulation with growth factors and Ro-31-8220.

Although the precise details of this pathway are unknown, it is thought that the Ras-related GTPase RhoA promotes TCF-independent SRF-dependent c-Fos expression in response to serum or LPA (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Certainly a role for RhoA in LPA-stimulated signaling is well established. ADP-ribosylation of RhoA at Asn41, catalyzed by the Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin (25Chardin P. Boquet P. Madaule P. Popoff M.R. Rubin E.J. Gill D.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) converts endogenous RhoA into a dominant inhibitory form which is able to block LPA-stimulated stress fiber formation in several cells types (26Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3806) Google Scholar, 27Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar). In addition, C3 toxin prevents the rapid LPA-stimulated retraction of neurites in neuronal cells (28Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Similarly, using isolated SRE or SRF sequences fused to a heterologous reporter gene in transient transfection assays, LPA-stimulated activation of the SRE is inhibited by C3 toxin in transient transfection assays while a mutationally activated RhoA (Val14) stimulates the SRE in the absence of LPA or serum (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Although these studies have focused attention on the SRE, it is unclear how well such transiently expressed reporters reflect the properties of the SRE in its physiological context (7Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 8Robertson L.M. Kerppola T.K. Vendrell M. Luk D. Smeyne R.J. Bocchiaro C. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 241-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). For example, more recently it has been shown that Rho is not required for activation of a stably integrated c-Fos reporter construct (29Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this study we have used biochemical inhibitors to examine the role of the Ras- and RhoA-regulated pathways in regulating the endogenous c-fos gene in LPA-stimulated Rat-1 cells. Selective inhibition of the Ras-dependent ERK cascade inhibits LPA-stimulated activation of the SRE and c-Fos protein expression. In contrast, C3 toxin partially antagonizes RhoA-dependent signaling to the isolated SRE but has no effect on LPA-stimulated c-Fos expression. We also demonstrate that C3 toxin stimulates the SAPK family of protein kinases and induces phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser73 but actually inhibits AP-1 transcriptional activity. Our results show that LPA-stimulated c-Fos expression proceeds in the absence of functional RhoA and further indicate that C3 toxin, frequently used as a selective inhibitor of RhoA function in cells, exerts a variety of previously undescribed effects on pathways regulating gene expression.

Samples to be blotted were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore) and developed using ECL detection reagents (Amersham Life Science). Membranes were blocked with PBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Primary antibody incubations were with anti-c-Jun antipeptide antibody (1:1000) from David Gillespie, Beatson CRC Laboratories (31May G.H. Funk M. Black E.J. Clark W. Hussain S. Woodgett J.R.

Rat-1 fibroblasts were trypsinized and washed two times in electroporation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.05, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mmdextrose) and resuspended at 2 × 107 cells per ml in electroporation buffer. 250 μl of cell suspension was placed in a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser cuvette in the absence (mock) or presence (C3) of the indicated concentration of purified C3 toxin. Cells were then electroporated at 250 kV and 125 microfarads. Electroporated cells were left on ice for 10 min and then replated in fresh DMEM supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 6 to 50 h prior to stimulating and/or harvesting. After electroporation in the presence or absence of C3 toxin, Rat-1 fibroblasts were plated on 25-mm glass coverslips and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 6 h, cells were washed with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium salts) and fixed with 4% formaldehyde + PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed two times with PBS + 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and actin was stained with FITC-phalloidin (Sigma, 1:60 dilution in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and mounted on microscope slides using FITC-Guard. Fluorescent staining was visualized using the Biological Dectection System software. In situADP-ribosylation of endogenous Rho proteins was monitored by assaying the incorporation of [32P] using detergent extracts from control or C3 toxin-treated cells using a modification of published protocols (32Paterson H.F. Self A. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 33Aktories K. Just I.

Cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 1 μg of purified recombinant C3 toxin and 1 μCi of [32P]NAD in 50 μl of ribosylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm thymidine, 300 μm GTP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Incubations were terminated by addition of 17 μl of 4 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. Samples were resolved on 14% SDS-PAGE gels, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and autoradiographed. SRE:Luc and AP-1/TRE:Luc reporter plasmids were created using the plasmid pGL3-enhancer vector (Promega) linearized at theBglII site upstream of the Luciferase reporter gene. A minimal TATA box (5′-TGGGTATATAATGGATC-3′) was inserted in front of the luciferase gene at the BglII site. For the SRE reporter plasmid, oligos GM932 (5′-GATCAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT-3′) and GM933 (5′-GATCAGATGTCCTAATATGGACATCCT-3′) and for the AP-1 reporter plasmid, GM940 (5′-GATCCGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) GM941 (5′-GATCTTCCGGCTGACTCATCAAGCG-3′) were ligated into theBglII site. Plasmids were then screened for insertion of multiple copies of the aforementioned oligonucleotide sequences by polymerase chain reaction and their sequence confirmed using the ABI 373 DNA sequencer. Both the SRE:Luc and AP-1/TRE:Luc reporter plasmids contain three copies of the SRE or AP-1, respectively. Each reporter plasmid was transfected into Rat-1 cells together with pBabe Puro (35Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar) by CaCl2 precipitation. Single colonies were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin and screened for expression of the reporter plasmid by assaying for luciferase activity in response to 20% FBS. Rat-1 cells stably expressing SRE:Luc or AP-1/TRE:Luc were maintined in 2 μg/ml puromycin until serum starved. For luciferase assays confluent cultures were washed in serum-free media and then maintained in serum-free media for 48 h prior to the application of external stimuli. Cells were stimulated by adding growth factors and other agents directly to the serum-free media. Cell lysis and luciferase assays were performed using the Tropix dual light system according to the manufacturer's instructions. All luciferase values were normalized to total cellular protein as determined by Bradford analysis. Rat-1 cells stably expressing the c-Fos SRE:Luc reporter were serum starved and pretreated with either pertussis toxin or PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1 (38Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), which completely inhibits ERK activation by either LPA or EGF in Rat-1 cells (39Cook S.J. Beltman J. Cadwallader K.A. McMahon M. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13309-13319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The cells were then stimulated with LPA or EGF for 15 h, harvested and assayed for luciferase activity (Fig.1 A). The LPA response was strongly inhibited by both pertussis toxin and PD98059 whereas the EGF response was inhibited by PD98059 but not pertussis toxin. These results are consistent with LPA and EGF acting via the Ras-dependent ERK pathway to activate the c-Fos SRE; in the case of LPA this pathway is regulated via a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi protein (18Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol.

Next we examined the effects of pertussis toxin and PD98059 on expression of the c-Fos protein, an assay of the full-length native promoter. Serum-starved Rat-1 cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin or control buffer for 18 h and then stimulated with LPA. After 1 h whole cell detergent lysates were analyzed for the expression of c-Fos (Fig. 1 B). LPA stimulated a strong increase in c-Fos expression and the c-Fos protein was also extensively phosphorylated as previously observed (40Chen R.-H. Juo P.C-H. Curran T. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1493-1502PubMed Google Scholar, 41Agarwal S. Corbley M.J. Roberts T.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 427-438PubMed Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin strongly inhibited both LPA-stimulated c-Fos expression and hyperphosphorylation. In addition, pretreatment with PD98059 resulted in a strong inhibition of c-Fos expression and phosphorylation in response to LPA, EGF, or the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Fig. 1 B). Taken together these results indicate that the Ras-dependent ERK cascade is a major pathway required for LPA- and EGF-stimulated c-Fos expression. The importance of RhoA in c-Fos expression appears to be dependent upon whether the reporter construct used is transiently, episomally expressed, or stably integrated (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, 29Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem we investigated the role of RhoA in expression of the native c-fos gene by monitoring c-Fos protein expression. Such an approach requires ablation of all RhoA function in the cell population; however, interfering mutants of RhoA often only allow partial inhibition of RhoA function and this problem is compounded by the efficiency of transfection protocols. We elected to use the C3 ADP-ribosyl transferase exoenzyme of C. botulinum to ADP-ribosylate and functionally inactivate RhoA in situthereby converting it to a dominant interfering form (26Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3806) Google Scholar, 27Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A.

Rat-1 cells were electro-permeabilized in the presence of increasing doses of C3 toxin (0.03 ng ml−1 to 30 μg ml−1), replated in media containing 0.5% serum and analyzed 8 h later for RhoA expression by immunoblotting. C3 toxin treatment caused the apparent molecular mass of RhoA to shift to a reduced mobility form which was apparent in all experiments (Fig.2 A, upper panel, and Fig.3 A) and is consistent with the covalent attachment of the ADP-ribose group (32Paterson H.F. Self A. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 33Aktories K. Just I.

In addition, the quantity of immune reactive RhoA was severely reduced by C3 toxin treatment; this effect was apparent after 6–8 h and proceeded such that RhoA was barely detectable after 18 h. 2S. J. Cook, unpublished observations. This apparent down-regulation of RhoA is consistent with previous reports (42Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Figure 3RhoA is not required for LPA stimulated ERK activation or c-Fos expression. Rat-1 cells were electro-permeabilized in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml C3 toxin, replated in DMEM + 0.5% FBS for 4 h, and then maintained in serum-free DMEM for 4 h before stimulating with 50 μm LPA for the times indicated. Whole cell detergent lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the expression of:A, RhoA, or B, c-Fos. C, Western immunoblots with a phospho-specific ERK antibody confirmed that LPA stimulated phosphorylation and activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was unaffected by C3 toxin treatment. Control immunoblots confirmed that the total immunoreactive ERK did not change in response to LPA or C3 toxin (data not shown). D, Rat-1 cells stably expressing a c-Fos SRE:Luc reporter construct were permeabilized in the absence (Con) or presence of C3 toxin (C3 tox), replated in DMEM + 0.5% FBS for 4 h, and then maintained in serum-free DMEM for 4 h before stimulating for 16 h with 50 μm LPA or 50 nm EGF. Cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. Values were normalized to total cellular protein. Data are shown from a single experiment in duplicate and are typical of three giving similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the reduced mobility of RhoA in C3 toxin-treated cells was due to ADP-ribosylation of the protein we performed an in vitro ADP-ribosylation reaction using recombinant purified C3 toxin and samples from control or C3 toxin-treated Rat-1 cells (32Paterson H.F. Self A. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 33Aktories K. Just I.

Control reactions using recombinant purified RhoA and Ki-Ras proteins confirmed the specificity of C3 toxin for RhoA under our reaction conditions.2 Pretreatment in situ with increasing concentrations of C3 toxin resulted in a saturable and dose-dependent decrease in the subsequent incorporation of radioactive ADP-ribose into RhoA in vitro (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) which matched the dose dependence of the mobility shift assay. The complete shift of RhoA to the lower mobility form suggested that ribosylation of endogenous RhoA was complete at 0.3–3 μg ml−1 C3 toxin. These effects were noted when the C3 toxin was added to whole cell monolayers over a 24-h period but under these conditions only 50–60% of the RhoA was ribosylated even at the highest concentrations used.2 Finally, we examined the state of actin stress fibers (26Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3806) Google Scholar, 27Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar) in C3 toxin-treated Rat-1 cells. After permeabilization Rat-1 cells were replated on coverslips in complete medium and 6 h later fixed and stained with phalloidin. In the control permeabilized cells abundant stress fibers were apparent (Fig. 2 B) and likely reflect the fact that these cells are growing in 10% fresh serum which contains LPA. In C3 toxin-treated cells, stress fibers were completely absent (Fig. 2 B). Based on these results we conclude that permeabilization with C3 toxin allows complete ADP-ribosylation and functional inactivation of all the endogenous RhoA in Rat-1 cells. We examined the role of RhoA in regulating the endogenous c-Fos promoter by examining c-Fos protein levels in C3 toxin-treated cells. Rat-1 cells maintained in 0.5% serum for 24 h were permeabilized in the presence or absence of 1 μg ml−1 C3 toxin (control and C3). These cells were replated and maintained in medium containing 0.5% serum for 4 h to allow reattachment; the cells were then serum starved for 4 h before stimulating with LPA.

Several cDNAs for ARF-like proteins (ARLs) have been cloned from human, Drosophila, rat, and yeast, although the biological function(s) of ARLs is unknown. We have identified a yeast gene (yARL3) encoding a protein that is structurally related (>43% identical) to the mammalian ARF-like protein ARP. Biochemical studies of purified recombinant yARL3 protein revealed properties similar to those of ARF and ARL proteins, including the ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP. Like other ARLs, recombinant yARL3 did not stimulate cholera toxin-catalyzed auto-ADP-ribosylation. Anti-yARL3 antibodies did not cross-react with yARFs or yARL1. yARL3 was not essential for cell viability, but disruption of yARL3 resulted in cold-sensitive cell growth. At the nonpermissive temperature, processing of alkaline phosphatase and carboxypeptidase Y in arl3 mutant was slowed. yARL3 might be required for protein transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi or from Golgi to vacuole at nonpermissive temperatures. On subcellular fractionation, unlike its mammalian homologue ARP, yARL3 was detected in the soluble fraction but not in the plasma membrane. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that yARL3 when overexpressed was associated in part with the endoplasmic reticulum-nuclear envelope. Thus, the structural and functional characteristics of yARL3 indicate that it may have a unique role(s) in vesicular trafficking.

Members of the ARF family have been identified in every eukaryotic cell examined; at least six ARFs have been identified in mammalian tissues.

Inin vitro assays, ARFs 1, 3, and 5 differed in their binding to Golgi (9Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10820-10825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recombinant human ARF6 was localized to the plasma membrane (11Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Sheff D. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and might, like the Rho-related GTPases, regulate plasma membrane architecture and participate in endocytosis by mediating cytoskeletal reorganization (12Cavenagh M.M.

ARF function depends on its alternation between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound conformations. As ARF has no detectable GTPase activity and exchanges bound nucleotide very slowly at physiological concentrations of Mg2+, its cycling between active and inactive forms is controlled by GTPase-activating proteins and guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins. In in vitro assays, ARFs also have been shown to stimulate the activity of phospholipase D, an enzyme found in Golgi membranes (13Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C.

The products of these genes appear to lack ADP-ribosyltransferase-enhancing activity, and they differ in GTP-binding requirements and GTPase activity from ARF isoforms. Although some of these proteins exhibit tissue- and/or differentiation-specific expression, the biological functions of ARLs are unknown. ARP, a mammalian ARF-like protein, was identified and characterized by cDNA cloning (23Schurmann A. Mabmann S. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30657-30663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is 33–39% identical to members of the ARF family and contains the characteristic sequence motifs involved in nucleotide binding (DVGG, NKQD, and CAT sequences) and GTP hydrolysis (GLDXAGK) (1Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). ARP differs, however, from other ARF family proteins by the absence of a myristoylation site, an insertion of eight amino acids between the GLDXAGK and DVGG consensus sequences, and the capacity to hydrolyze bound GTP in the absence of other proteins. Most of the ARP protein, unlike ARFs, is associated with plasma membrane instead of the cytosol. Four members of the ARF family have been reported in yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Those include three ARFs (yARF1 (24Sewell J.L. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4620-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), yARF2 (25Stearns T. Kahn R.A. Botstein D. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and yARF3 (26Lee F.-J.S. Stevens L.A. Kao Y.L. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20931-20937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and an ARF-like protein (yARL1 (22Lee F.-J.S. Huang C.-F. Yu W.-L. Buu L.-M. Lin C.-Y. Huang M.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30998-31005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). yARF1 and yARF2 are thought to act in ER-to-Golgi secretory protein sorting; yARF3 is most similar in amino acid sequence to human ARF6, which has been implicated in the regulation of early endocytic transport. yARL1 is a recently characterized ∼20-kDa GTPase, which may in part reside in the Golgi and which has a function distinct from those of yARF1 and yARF2. Sequence analysis of the S. cerevisiae genome identified a ARF-like gene, yARL3, the product of which is homologous to mammalian ARP (23Schurmann A. Mabmann S. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30657-30663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This report describes the genetic, molecular, and biochemical characterization of yARL3. Like yARL1 and yARF3, yARL3 is not essential for cell viability; however, arl3 mutants appear to be cold-sensitive. yARL3 is required for vacuolar protein transport at nonpermissive temperatures. Unlike mammalian ARP, which was exclusively detected on the plasma membrane, yARL3 was found in the soluble fraction and associated in part with the ER-nuclear envelope structures. Thus, yARL3 may function in a novel ER-associated vesicular trafficking pathway. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in TableI. Yeast culture media were prepared as described by Sherman et al. (27Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). YPD and YPGal contained 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose or 2% galactose, respectively; SD contained 0.7% Difco yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids) and 2% glucose. Nutrients essential for auxotrophic strains were supplied at specified concentrations (27Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Sporulation, growth, and mating were carried out as described (28Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains were transformed by the lithium acetate method (29Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J.

Open table in a new tab Unless otherwise specified, the protocol used for PCR amplification was 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, followed by extension at 72 °C for 10 min, in a solution containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 20 mm each dNTP, 0.1% Tween, 25 pmol of each amplification primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (total volume, 100 μl). Samples of reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel. All PCR products were purified, subcloned, and sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar). Yeast ARL3 gene was cloned by PCR using a yeast genomic DNA as template and primers complementary to sequences upstream or downstream of the Lpe21p gene (Yeast Genome Project, accession number U39205). The nucleotide sequence of yARL3 has GenBank accession number U89332. DNA sequences were analyzed and multiple protein alignments were prepared using a GeneWorks software package (IntelliGenetics, Inc., Mountain View, CA). yARL3 DNA generated by PCR was subcloned into pGEM-7Zf plasmid resulting in pGyL3. The yeastURA3 gene was inserted at the single EcoNI site in the yARL3 gene as follows: The 3.8-kb DNA fragment containing the yeast URA3 gene and two hisGrepeat sequences was excised from the plasmid pNKY51 (32Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) by digestion with BglII and BamHI; the 5′ overhangs were filled in with Klenow fragment. Plasmid pGyL3, containing theyARL3 gene, was linearized at the internal EcoNIsite; the overhang ends were filled in with Klenow fragment and the cDNA was ligated to the 3.8-kb hisG-URA3-hisG fragment, resulting in pGyL3U. Gene disruption mutants were constructed by a one-step gene replacement method (33Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ∼4.8-kb DNA fragment excised from pGyL3U by digestion with XhoI and BamHI was used to transform various Ura − strains (see Table I), and uracil prototrophs were selected. DNA blot analysis of the URA+ cells confirmed that the yARL3 gene contained an additional 3.8-kb, corresponding to thehisG-URA3-hisG gene. Elimination of the URA3 and one hisG repeat was carried out as described previously (28Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double deletions of yARL3 and yARL1 or ofyARL3 and yARF3 were performed in yeastarl3 mutants (arl3::hisG, ura3),arl1 mutants (arl1::hisG, ura3), andarf3 mutants (arf3::hisG, ura3) that are listed in Table I. The open reading frame of yeast ARL3 was obtained by PCR, using primers that incorporated unique NdeI and BamHI sites at the initiating methionine and 6 base pairs 3′ of the stop codon, respectively. For the His-tag-yARL3 fusion protein, a DNA fragment containing the yARL3 coding region was generated by amplifying yeast genomic DNA with sequence-specific primers. The PCR product was purified and annealed to the expression vector pET15b (Novagen), yielding pET15byL3. For the nonfusion protein, PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified, and annealed to expression vector pT7 (34Haun R.S. Moss J. Gene. 1992; 112: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), yielding pT7yARL3. BL21 (DE3) cells containing expression plasmids were grown to a density ofA 600 = 1.0 at which time the inducer, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4/1 mm EDTA, and stored at −80 °C until used. For large scale production of recombinant proteins, 5 ml of overnight culture were used to inoculate 1 liter of LB broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), followed by shaking at 37 °C. WhenA 600 reached 0.6–0.8, protein production was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and bacteria were collected by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing lysozyme, 0.5 mg/ml, and disrupted by sonification. The lysate was centrifuged after addition of Triton X-100 to 1%, and His-tagged fusion protein was isolated on Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) by standard methods. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Protein was quantified by Coomassie Blue or silver stain assays (Bio-Rad). The recombinant N-terminal His-tagged fusion protein yARL3 was synthesized in Escherichia coli using pET15-b expression plasmid (Novagen), isolated on Ni2+-NTA resin, and further purified by SDS-PAGE. Denatured purified proteins from SDS-PAGE gel were used as antigens to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits essentially as described (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared by harvesting three optical density units (A 600)/ml of cells. Yeast cell concentration was assessed by absorbance at 600 nm. Cells were suspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) to a final A 600 of 30. Whole cell extracts were then prepared by vortexing with glass beads for 2 min at 4 °C and clarified by brief centrifugation. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). Incubation with antibodies was carried out in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dried skim milk at room temperature for 60 min. The anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11, Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (H + L) were each diluted 1:5000. Bound antibodies were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary and secondary antibodies and luminol substrate were removed from the blot using the blot-stripping protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 3′-end of the yARL3 cDNA was altered so that the encoded protein contained the sequence199YPYDVPDYA*207 at its extreme C terminus. The sequence of the HA epitope is underlined; the asterisk indicates stop codon. The Q78L replacement was introduced using a two-step recombinant PCR technique. In the primary PCR, overlapping 5′- and 3′-DNA fragments were generated. The 5′-oligonucleotide primer (gcacatatgtttcatttagtcaagg) and 5′-Q78L oligonucleotide primer (ctcagtgattctagaccacctacatccc; the point mutation is underlined), served as primers for amplification of the 5′-fragment. The 3′-fragment was generated using 3′-Q78L oligonucleotide (gatgtaggtggtctagaatcactgagatc) primer in combination with the 3′-end antisense oligonucleotide primer (ctttggatccttctttatcatttataaatcg). In the second fusogenic PCR, the appropriate pairs of overlapping fragments were combined with the 5′- and 3′-end primers to generate the full-length Q78L mutant sequence. The full-length Q78L mutant DNA was then purified, subcloned, and sequenced. The yARL3-HA and yARL3(Q78L) DNAs were subcloned into the pVT101U plasmid, an expression plasmid containing the ADH1 promoter (36Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene. 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), as a XhoI-XbaI fragment intoXhoI-XbaI sites to yield pVT101yL3HA and pVT101yL3(Q78L), respectively. Yeast was grown at 30 °C overnight in selective minimal medium containing 200 mm (NH4)2SO4 to anA 600 of 0.5. After 30 min at 37 °C or at 15 °C, cells were transferred to sulfate-free, selective minimal medium (final A 600 = 5), and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C or for 30 min at 15 °C, before addition of 30 μCi of Pro-mix l-35S label (blend of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, 14.3mCi/ml) per A 600 unit. After 5 min (at 37 °C) or 20 min (at 15 °C), labeling was terminated by addition of 5% (v/v) of chase solution (0.3% cysteine (w/v), 0.4% methionine (w/v), and 100 mm(NH4)2SO4). Samples (1 ml) were removed at the indicated time (at 37 or 15 °C) thereafter and added to equal volumes of ice-cold 20 mm NaN3 in double-distilled H2O. Cells were collected and washed with 10 mm NaN3 in double-distilled H2O. Glass beads (300 μl) and 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added, and the mixture was agitated vigorously for 90 s at room temperature before immersion in a boiling water bath for 6 min. Immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, and autoradiography were done essentially as described (37Stirling C.J. Rothblatt J.A. Hosobuchi M. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), using anti-yARL3, anti-carboxypeptidase Y (anti-CPY), or anti-alkaline phosphatase (anti-ALP) antiserum. Endocytosis of Lucifer Yellow CH was performed as described.(38Dukic V. Egerton M. Elguindi I. Raths S. Singer B. Riezman H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) Briefly, oneA 600 unit/ml of mid-log phase cells (1 ml) was collected, suspended in 90 μl of fresh medium, and added to 10 μl of Lucifer Yellow CH (40 mg/ml). Cells were incubated at 30 °C for 30–90 min or at 15 °C for 2–4 h, harvested, washed three times in endocytosis wash buffer (50 mm succinate, 2 mmNaN3, pH 5.0), and suspended in 10 μl of the same buffer. Samples (2.5 μl) of cells were mixed with an equal volume of 1.6% low melting agarose (at 45 °C) and mounted on microscope slides before visualization by fluorescence microscopy using fluorescein isothiocyanate optics. Samples (5 μg) of purified His-tagged -yARL3 or -yARF1 fusion protein were tested for their ability to stimulate cholera toxin-catalyzed auto-ADP-ribosylation in reaction mixtures (total volume, 100 μl) containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm thymidine, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.003% SDS, 10 μm[32P]NAD (2 mCi), and 1 μg of activated cholera toxin A. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, reactions were terminated by the addition of 1.0 ml of ice-cold 7.5% trichloroacetic acid. After precipitation overnight at 4 °C and centrifugation, proteins were dissolved in 60 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, and 0.006% bromphenol blue (10 min at 65 °C); separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels; and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were exposed to x-ray film for 24 h. Binding of GTPγS to purified recombinant yARL3 was determined by a filter trapping method (39Northup J.K. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Duplicate or triplicate samples were transferred to 2 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol before rapid filtration on 0.45 μm HA filters (Millipore, Bedford). The amount of nucleotide bound to the fusion protein was quantified by scintillation counting. Data were fitted to a first-order rate equation. GTP hydrolysis was determined by binding[α-32P]GTP to 5.0 μm recombinant yARL3 protein, as described by Randazzo and Kahn (40Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1995576632,"The transglutaminase I (TGase I) gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the cross-linking of structural proteins involved in the formation of the cornified envelope during squamous cell differentiation. To identify DNA elements important for the transcriptional control of the TGase I gene, we analyzed the ability of a 2.9-kilobase pair (kb) upstream regulatory region to control the expression of a reporter gene in vivo and in vitro. Transgenic mice bearing the pTG(−2.9kb)CAT construct exhibited the same pattern of tissue-specific expression of CAT as reported for TGase I. Deletion analysis in transiently transfected rabbit tracheal epithelial cells indicated that two sequences from bp −490 to −470 and from −54 to −37 are involved in the activation of TGase I transcription. Point mutation analysis and mobility shift assays showed that the sequence located between −54 and −37 is a functional Sp1-like transcription element. Sp1 and Sp3, but not Sp2, are part of nuclear protein complexes from differentiated RbTE cells binding to this site. The element TGATGTCA between bp −490 and −470 is contained in a larger 22-bp palindrome and resembles the consensus cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/AP-1 element recognized by dimeric complexes of members of the CREB, ATF, Fos, and Jun families. Mutations in this sequence greatly reduced promoter activity. Supershift analysis identified CREB1, JunB, c-Fos, Fra-1, and c-Jun in protein complexes isolated from differentiated rabbit tracheal epithelial cells binding to this site. Our study shows that the Sp1- and CREB/AP-1-like sites act in concert to stimulate transcription of the TGase I gene. The 2.9-kb promoter region could guide expression of specific genes in the granular layer of the epidermis and could be useful in gene therapy.

Analysis of the TGase I promoter may provide insight not only into the molecular mechanisms controlling this gene in squamous epithelia and squamous metaplasia but also into the molecular pathogenesis of lamellar ichthyosis and lead to new methods of treatment, including drug and gene therapy. In this study, we analyzed the ability of a 2.9-kb promoter regulatory region of the TGase I gene to control the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter genein vivo and in vitro. We show that this region directs expression of the transgene to the suprabasal layers, comprising the late spinous and granular layers, of several squamous tissues. This pattern of expression correlates well with that reported for TGase I (47Michel S. Bernard F. Jetten A.M. Floyd E.E.R. Shroot B. Reichert U. J. Invest.

Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured in KGM medium (Clonetics). Rabbit tracheal fibroblasts were grown in Ham's F-12/RPMI 1640 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The plasmid pTG(−2.9kb)-LUC containing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the −2.9 kb promoter flanking region of the TGase I gene has been previously described (34Saunders N.A.

The deletion mutants pTG(−1.5kb)-LUC and pTG(−350)-LUC were constructed using theSmaI and ApaI restriction sites (Fig.1 A). The minimal promoter construct pTG(−37)-LUC and pTG(−54)-LUC were made by cloning the respective PCR products into the promoterless luciferase vector pGL2-Basic (Promega). Deletion mutants in region −750 to −350 bp were constructed by PCR-directed cloning into the construct pTG(−37)-LUC (Fig. 2 A). All PCR reactions were conducted with proofreading Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and the original 2.9-kb construct was used as template. All primers contained a six-base 5′-leader sequence followed by a six-base restriction site (KpnI, MluI, orXhoI) and a 20-base promoter sequence. Point mutation constructs were made by direct cloning of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides upstream of pTG(−37)-LUC. The sequences of the PCR products were checked for accuracy using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method and the Sequenase Quick-denature plasmid sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Figure 2Localization of CAT reporter mRNA in the stratified, squamous-differentiated epithelium of the tongue from transgenic mice containing pTG(−2.9)-CAT.

Plasmid DNA used in transfections were isolated and purified with a Wizard Miniprep kit (Promega). RbTE cells were grown to confluence in six-well dishes, and transfections were carried out in triplicate using lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were incubated in 1.0 ml of Ham's F-12 medium without growth factors and antibiotics in the presence of 1.5 μg of total DNA and 5 μl of lipofectamine. Cotransfection with β-actin-CAT reporter plasmid was carried out to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. After a 5-h incubation, medium was replaced with complete F-12 or KGM medium. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection and assayed for reporter activity. Whole cell extracts were prepared with the lysis buffer included in the CAT ELISA kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's protocol and used in CAT and luciferase assays. Luciferase assays were performed with the Luciferase Assay Kit from Promega. The relative luciferase activity was normalized for CAT reporter activity. Nuclei were isolated from differentiated rabbit tracheobronchial epithelial cells, and nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (50Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, collected into microtubes, and centrifuged for 10 s in a microcentrifuge. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold, low salt buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 0.1 mmsodium vanadate). After incubation on ice for 20 min, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. The cell suspension was vigorously vortexed for 20 s followed by centrifugation for 30 s in a microcentrifuge to collect the nuclei. The nuclei were resuspended in 10 volumes of high salt buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.42 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 20 min followed by a 10-min centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were collected and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (CTCCGCCCCGCCCGATCGAAT), the AP-1 consensus (CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA), the CREB consensus (GTACTGGCTGCTGACGTCACCAGCCA), and other oligonucleotides were synthesized using a model 392 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotides for EMSA were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and purified with NAP-5 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 0.1 ng (50,000 cpm) of the oligonucleotide probe and 0.5 μg of nuclear extract were used in the binding reaction in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol. To prevent nonspecific binding, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.2 μg of salmon sperm DNA were included in the reaction. The binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 25 min in the presence or absence of a 10- or 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotide competitors. For supershift analysis, various antibodies were included in the incubation mixture. DNA-protein complexes were separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at room temperature in 0.5× TBE. Antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, c-Jun, Ser63-phosphorylated c-Jun, JunB, JunD, Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Fos, CREB1, CREB2, ATF-2, and ATF-4 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A TGase I promoter fragment from −750 to −350 bp was generated by PCR with proofreading Vent DNA polymerase (NE Biolabs). One of the primers used for PCR was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The binding mixture contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10–20 μg of nuclear extract, 1 ng of labeled DNA, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The binding reaction was carried out for 25 min at room temperature and then treated with different concentrations of DNase I. After 1 min of incubation with DNase I, 1 volume of stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS) was added. DNA was purified by phenol extraction and concentrated with Microcon-30 (Amicon). DNA fragments were separated on a 6% sequencing gel. The construction of the pTG-(−2.9)CAT reporter was carried out by cloning the 2.9-kb promoter fragment (KpnI/NheI restriction fragment) from pTG(−2.9)LUC into the XbaI site of the promoterless pCAT reporter plasmid (Promega). Compatible end ligation of the NheI site into the XbaI site was followed by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting blunt ended XbaI and KpnI sites were then autoligated. Orientation of the clones was confirmed by sequencing. This plasmid was linearized, and a 4.5-kbHindIII/BamHI DNA fragment containing the −2873 to +89 bp regulatory region of TGase I gene and the CAT reporter excised. The fragment was purified and microinjected into the pronuclei of one-cell mouse embryos obtained from C57BL/6J females mated with SJL F2 males. The embryos were then transferred to the oviduct of pseudopregnant females, and normal gestation was allowed. Positive founder transgenic mice carrying the construct were identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies. A rabbit TGase I promoter-specific primer, 5′-TCGGCCCCGCCCTCCCCA, and a CAT-specific primer, 5′-AACGGTGGTATATCCAGTGA, were used for the analysis. Tissues for CAT assay, RNA isolation, and in situ hybridization were taken from 3- or 12-month-old mice. Transgenic mice were sacrificed, and tissues isolated and fixed for 3 h with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, tissues were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, permeated with xylene, and embedded in paraplast. In situhybridization was performed as described (51Matsuura H. Myokai F. Arata J. Noji S. Taniguchi S. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1994; 8: 25-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with the following minor modification. Serial sections (5 μm) were mounted on Silane-prep™ slides (Sigma), deparaffinized, acetylated, and pretreated with 2× sodium citrate (SCC), 50% formamide, 10 mm dithiothreitol at 50 °C. Radiolabeled sense and antisense CAT probes were generated with either T3 or T7 RNA polymerase and 35S-labeled UTP and CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1000 Ci/mmol), as described (55Choate K.A. Khavari P.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Probes were subjected to limited alkaline hydrolysis to reduce the size of the transcripts to about 150 bases. After hybridization at 50 °C for 16 h, the sections were washed and treated with RNase. The slides were dipped in NTB-2 emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.) diluted 1:1.5 and exposed for 14 days at 4 °C. Slides were developed and counterstained with hematoxylin. The cloning and sequence of the 2.9-kb 5′-flanking region of the rabbit TGase I gene has been reported previously (26Jetten A.M. George M.A. Smits H.L. Vollberg T.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 182: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We also mapped the transcription start site and showed that this promoter region was able to induce transactivation of the luciferase reporter gene during differentiation of cultured RbTE cells (26Jetten A.M. George M.A. Smits H.L. Vollberg T.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 182: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether this region is able to control the expression of TGase I in vivo in a cell type- and differentiation-specific manner, we constructed an expression vector in which the CAT reporter is under the control of the 2.9-kb 5′-flanking region of the rabbit TGase I gene and introduced this plasmid into the mouse germ line. The presence of this transgene was corroborated by PCR. Two independent founders, which contained and expressed the integrated transgene, were selected for subsequent analysis. Protein extracts prepared from various tissues of control and transgenic mice were analyzed for CAT protein concentration. As expected, no CAT protein was detectable in any of the tissues isolated from control mice (Fig. 1 B). In the transgenic mice, CAT protein was only detected in crude protein extracts from tissues that normally express TGase I, including skin, tongue, and esophagus. The highest CAT levels were found in extracts from tongue and esophagus; lower levels were found in skin. This pattern of CAT expression is consistent with the known expression levels of TGase I in these tissues (34Saunders N.A. Bernacki S.H. Vollberg T.M. Jetten A.M. Mol. Endocrin"

In Xenopus laevis, oocytes are naturally arrested at the G2/M transition of meiosis I. Upon release of progesterone by the follicle cells surrounding the oocytes, maturation occurs and the cell cycle resumes. Translation of the proto-oncogene c-Mos (a MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MPF, maturation-promoting factor; PKA, protein kinase A; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Plx, Polo-like kinase; GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; NEBD, nuclear envelope breakdown.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MPF, maturation-promoting factor; PKA, protein kinase A; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Plx, Polo-like kinase; GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; NEBD, nuclear envelope breakdown. kinase kinase), is an essential preliminary event (2Sagata N.

Conversion of inactive pre-MPF complexes, stored in oocytes, into active MPF requires dephosphorylation of residues Thr14 and Tyr15 on p34cdc2 kinase (7Strausfeld U. Labbé J.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.C. Picard A. Sadhu K. Russell P. Dorée M. Nature. 1991; 351: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of these amino acids is crucial for MPF activation, and this process is highly regulated by an activating phosphatase, Cdc25 (for review see Ref. 8Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and two inhibitory kinases, Myt1 (9Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G.

Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).Although oocyte maturation has been extensively studied over the past 10 years as a model to understand the mechanisms involved in reentry into the cell cycle, the signal transduction pathway between progesterone binding to its receptor and the activation of the MAPK cascade and MPF is ill understood. Protein kinase A (PKA) appears to be a crucial player in these events, because activation of progesterone receptor is followed by a sudden drop in cAMP concentration (11Speaker M.C. Butcher F.R. Nature. 1977; 267: 848-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and likely a subsequent inactivation of protein kinase A. Indeed, microinjection of the PKA catalytic subunit prevents progesterone-induced maturation in oocytes, whereas the expression of the PKA regulatory subunit is sufficient to induce maturation (12Maller J. Krebs E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Matten et al. (13Matten W. Daar I. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4419-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) reported that PKA negatively regulates maturation by controlling both c-Mos translation and Cdc25 activation. How PKA acts on c-Mos de novo translation is, however, unclear, and we have demonstrated that in conditions in oocytes in which activation of MAPK is allowed, PKA does not inhibit the c-Mos translation (14Faure S. Morin N. Dorée M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that PKA could act on a single target in the negative regulation of maturation.A number of studies demonstrate the importance of the MAPK cascade in MPF activation (6Sagata N.

EMBO J. 1994; 9: 2131-2138Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar) during Xenopus oocyte maturation. Indeed, microinjection of recombinant c-Mos is itself sufficient to induce oocyte maturation in the absence of hormonal treatment (16Yew N. Mellini M.L. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 17Sagata N. Daar I. Oskarsson M. Showalter S.D. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1989; 245: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), whereas CL100 (MAPK phosphatase-1) inhibits progesterone-induced maturation (18Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Dell K. Shirakabe K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25898-25904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Important work in Saccharomyces cerevisiaetoward the understanding of the control of the MAPK cascade has been undertaken in the last few years. The response to the mating pheromone signal is mediated by the direct interaction of the Gβ subunit of G protein heterotrimers to Ste20, a serine threonine kinase (19Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Activation of Ste20 results in activation of the MAPK kinase kinase Ste11, which allows the MAPK cascade to be turned on and results in MAPK (Kss1 and Fus3) activation (reviewed in Ref. 20Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 162-167Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). InXenopus oocytes, Gotoh et al. (18Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Dell K. Shirakabe K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25898-25904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) showed that microinjection of constitutively active Ste11 is able to efficiently induce the maturation process. Moreover, addition of the N-terminal regulatory domain of Ste11 to Xenopus extracts prevents a constitutive form of Ste20 from activating MAPK (21Polverino A. Frost J. Yang P. Hutchison M.

Understanding of their functional importance in signal transduction and in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is rapidly growing (see Refs. 22Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have cloned Xenopus PAKs and recently demonstrated that a member of this family is involved in regulation of the oocyte maturation process (1Faure S. Vigneron S. Dorée M. Morin N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Indeed, we showed that microinjection of a constitutive truncated version of X-PAK1 (X-PAK1-Cter) into oocytes completely blocks both insulin and progesterone mediated maturation, and conversely, the dominant negative version of the kinase facilitated this process. In this present report, we focus on how X-PAK1 negatively regulates maturation. Our results demonstrate that X-PAK1-Cter prevents c-Mos synthesis and MAPK activation in progesterone-treated oocytes. Even if MAPK is activated by injection of recombinant c-Mos, no H1 kinase activity can be detected. All the enzymes involved in regulation of p34cdc2 kinase are affected by X-PAK1-Cter expression in progesterone-treated oocytes. We show that in the presence of X-PAK1 kinase activity, pre-MPF complexes can efficiently form but activation of pre-MPF fails. Furthermore, in the presence of active MPF, X-PAK1 kinase activity prevents the amplification loop from being switched on. We have analyzed a possible link of transduction pathways used by PKA and X-PAK in controlling maturation and show that X-PAK1-Cter is still capable of inhibiting maturation induced by the regulatory domain of PKA. Finally, using cell-free Xenopus egg cycling extracts, which mimic the alternation of S and M phases of the first embryonic cycles, we can reproduce the inhibition of entry into mitosis with the catalytic domain of X-PAK1. Thus the involvement of XenopusPAK in G2/M transition is not restricted to oocyte meiotic maturation and can be extended to the first embryonic cell cycles.DISCUSSIONOocyte maturation is a highly regulated process, and a complete understanding of the many intertwining regulations involved is far from being a reality. GVBD is always associated with high cyclin B-p34cdc2 activity, which results from the activation of stockpiled complexes, occurring by a well described amplification loop. Although experimental conditions have been described in which GVBD can occur in the absence of MAPK activity (34Rime H. Haccard O. Ozon R. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it is widely accepted that the MAPK cascade participates in normal maturation in the activation of MPF. Understanding the event required for activation of the first cyclin B-p34cdc2 complex, which in turn will start the amplification loop, is crucial to explain the maturation process, and in this regard identification of new regulatory proteins will certainly help to reconstitute the sequence of activation of the different pathways.In this report we investigate how constitutive Xenopusp21-activated kinase negatively controls the oocyte maturation process. Our results indicate that X-PAK1 mimics the effects previously reported for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A by preventing c-Mos accumulation as well as MAPK and MPF activation (13Matten W. Daar I. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4419-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Faure S. Morin N. Dorée M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We show, in a context in which MAPK activation is activated by injection of c-Mos, that accumulation of the endogenous proto-oncogene does occur, in the presence of X-PAK1. Thus X-PAK1 does not interfere with the amplification loop in which active MAPK controls c-Mos synthesis (42Matten W.T. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Vande Woude G.F. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) but rather prevents the initial MAPK activation. Even on c-Mos microinjection, no H1 kinase activity is detected, indicating that X-PAK1 also affects MPF activation. We used recombinant cyclin B, and active MPF, to demonstrate that formation of new pre-MPF complexes is not affected but that they are not activated in the presence of active X-PAK1.Indeed, we show that the regulatory kinases and Cdc25 phosphatase identified in MPF amplification during the maturation process remain in their initial state. A well accepted concept is that activation of the first MPF molecules is the result of activation and/or inactivation of Cdc25 and Myt1, respectively, by an upstream regulating element different from MPF itself. Indeed, in SDS-PAGE, Cdc25 displays a complex phosphorylation pattern and can also be phosphorylated and activated by kinases other than MPF itself, Plx-1 (36Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and possibly Raf-1(43).Raf-1 may be a Cdc25-activating kinase (43Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and it also acts as a MAPK kinase kinase (44Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) whose involvement in regulation of maturation is subject to controversy. Using a dominant negative mutant approach it has been reported (45Muslin A.J. Mac Nicol A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that Raf-1 activation is required for progesterone-induced maturation, but this result was challenged (46Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Daar I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that autophosphorylation of Raf-1 on serine 621 (47Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P.K. Enlitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) is a way to down-regulate its activity, and this same site can also be phosphorylated by PKA. We discussed in a previous paper a possible transient activation of Raf-1 in Xenopus oocytes, upon down-regulation of PKA, during normal maturation induced by progesterone (14Faure S. Morin N. Dorée M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because Raf-1 mobility shift observed during maturation by progesterone is usually equated to the kinase activation, we verified that Raf-1 is indeed prevented from shifting upon progesterone treatment of oocytes injected with X-PAK1-Cter (data not shown). As X-PAK1 belongs to the well known family of PAK proteins that were first isolated as upstream regulators of MAPK cascades, involvement of X-PAK in Raf-1 kinase regulation is an interesting hypothesis.We show that X-PAK1-Cter negatively targets the same events in inhibition of maturation as PKA/C and moreover that X-PAK1-Cter prevents maturation induced by the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, but we have been unable to demonstrate any direct activation of endogenous X-PAK1 or two other closely related family members X-PAK2 and X-PAK3 by PKA/C. Both pathways could also be linked in a different manner; for example, X-PAK could interfere with the ability of PKA to form a tetramer (for example by phosphorylation of PKA/R) and consequently inhibit its inactivation. Indeed it has previously been demonstrated that PKA/RII can be phosphorylated in vitro by different kinases, and recently Keryer et al. (41Keryer G. Yassenko M. Labbé J.C. Castro A. Lohmann S.M. Evain-Brion D. Taskén K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34594-34602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported that MPF can also phosphorylate it. We verified that neither PKA/R nor PKA/C are substrates of X-PAK1-Cter. At the moment we cannot rule out other possible cross-links in the pathways used by the two kinases; however, another possible explanation of our results would be that both pathways are parallel and that active X-PAK and PKA target an identical substrate that allows the MPF amplification loop to be turned on.Both PKA and X-PAK kinases are also capable of inhibiting the G2/M transition during the first mitotic cycle, at which point cyclin B-p34cdc2 is still regulated by phosphorylation on Tyr15, but control by MAPK activity is absent. We show that X-PAK1-Cter does not prevent cyclin A-p34cdc2 activation in cell-free egg cycling extracts, and in fact the kinase reaches an abnormally high level of activity compared with a control cycling extract supplemented with MalBP fusion protein. Nevertheless, under these conditions, high cyclin A-p34cdc2activity does not allow cyclin B-p34cdc2 activation, and as a consequence the cyclin degradation pathway is not turned on. We show that cyclin B-p34cdc2 complexes are indeed formed, but no H1 activity is associated with them, and the p34cdc2 subunit displays a slow electrophoretic mobility indicative of phosphorylation on Tyr15. We conclude that X-PAK1-Cter activity is very specific because it does not interfere with the activity of cyclin A-p34cdc2 complexes, which are not subject to a regulation by phosphorylation on Tyr15 (30Abrieu A. Brassac T. Galas S. Fisher D. Labbé J.C. Dorée M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1751-1757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Clarke P.R. Leiss D. Pagano M. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1751-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but it does interfere specifically with the activation of cyclin B-p34cdc2 complexes by preventing dephosphorylation of Tyr15. In 1994 Griecoet al. (49Grieco D. Avvedimento E. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9896-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showed that PKA activity oscillates during the first embryonic cycles in Xenopus extracts, being high at interphase and falling at the onset of mitosis. They demonstrated that sustained PKA activity inhibits cycle progression in a dose-dependent manner and that extracts eventually arrest in interphase with a high level of inactive pre-MPF complexes. In this context, X-PAK1–1Cter and PKA probably act independently of a control over MAPK activity, because MAPK is inactive in the cycling extract, and so this cannot be compared with the G2/M transition block described previously (50Abrieu A. Fisher D. Simon M.N. Dorée M. Picard A. EMBO J. 1997; 21: 6407-6413Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), in which the proto-oncogene c-Mos is added to cycling extracts. The work of Grieco et al. (49Grieco D. Avvedimento E. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9896-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) indicates that PKA could stimulate an okadaic acid-sensitive serine/threonine phosphatase pathway that dephosphorylates Cdc25.Plx kinase is another Cdc25 positive regulatory kinase (36Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) recently shown (30Abrieu A. Brassac T. Galas S. Fisher D. Labbé J.C. Dorée M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1751-1757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to be required for the G2/M transition during the first mitotic cell cycle in Xenopus eggs. Cyclin B-p34cdc2 enhances Plx activation, which triggers Cdc25 and MPF activation in a positive feedback loop. Adding blocking anti-Plx antibodies to an egg cycling extract suppressed entry into mitosis, although a strong cyclin A-p34cdc2 activity is detected, as we observed ourselves in the X-PAK1-Cter block in cycling extracts. Moreover, pre-MPF complexes also remain inactive and phosphorylated on Tyr15, if Plx is blocked with these antibodies. We did not investigate the status of Plx in cycling extracts incubated with X-PAK1-Cter, but we show that during the maturation process Plx activation is prevented by active Xenopus p21-activated kinase.In summary, our data demonstrate that PKA and X-PAK pathways target the same components in their inhibition of G2/M progression during meiosis as well as in the first mitotic cycle inXenopus and that their transduction pathways are likely to be connected at the point where the MPF amplification loop is turned on. We are currently in the process of isolating physiological substrates of X-PAK active kinase in Xenopus extracts to get new insights into factors regulating the G2/M transition. In Xenopus laevis, oocytes are naturally arrested at the G2/M transition of meiosis I. Upon release of progesterone by the follicle cells surrounding the oocytes, maturation occurs and the cell cycle resumes. Translation of the proto-oncogene c-Mos (a MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MPF, maturation-promoting factor; PKA, protein kinase A; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Plx, Polo-like kinase; GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; NEBD, nuclear envelope breakdown.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MPF, maturation-promoting factor; PKA, protein kinase A; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Plx, Polo-like kinase; GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; NEBD, nuclear envelope breakdown. kinase kinase), is an essential preliminary event (2Sagata N.

A. 1991; 88: 5794-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in turning on the MAPK cascade, which eventually results in almost simultaneous activation of MAPK and maturation-promoting factor (MPF), a heterodimer composed of p34cdc2 kinase and cyclin B (4Labbé J.C.

Eggs eventually arrest again at metaphase of second meiosis with high MPF and cytostatic factor (in which c-Mos participates (6Sagata N. Watanabe N. Vande Woude G.F. Ikawa Y. Nature. 1989; 342: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar)) activities until fertilization. Conversion of inactive pre-MPF complexes, stored in oocytes, into active MPF requires dephosphorylation of residues Thr14 and Tyr15 on p34cdc2 kinase (7Strausfeld U. Labbé J.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.C. Picard A. Sadhu K. Russell P. Dorée M. Nature. 1991; 351: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of these amino acids is crucial for MPF activation, and this process is highly regulated by an activating phosphatase, Cdc25 (for review see Ref. 8Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and two inhibitory kinases, Myt1 (9Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and Wee1 (10Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although oocyte maturation has been extensively studied over the past 10 years as a model to understand the mechanisms involved in reentry into the cell cycle, the signal transduction pathway between progesterone binding to its receptor and the activation of the MAPK cascade and MPF is ill understood. Protein kinase A (PKA) appears to be a crucial player in these events, because activation of progesterone receptor is followed by a sudden drop in cAMP concentration (11Speaker M.C. Butcher F.R. Nature. 1977; 267: 848-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and likely a subsequent inactivation of protein kinase A. Indeed, microinjection of the PKA catalytic subunit prevents progesterone-induced maturation in oocytes, whereas the expression of the PKA regulatory subunit is sufficient to induce maturation (12Maller J. Krebs E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Matten et al. (13Matten W. Daar I. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4419-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) reported that PKA negatively regulates maturation by controlling both c-Mos translation and Cdc25 activation. How PKA acts on c-Mos de novo translation is, however, unclear, and we have demonstrated that in conditions in oocytes in which activation of MAPK is allowed, PKA does not inhibit the c-Mos translation (14Faure S. Morin N. Dorée M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that PKA could act on a single target in the negative regulation of maturation. A number of studies demonstrate the importance of the MAPK cascade in MPF activation (6Sagata N. Watanabe N. Vande Woude G.F. Ikawa Y. Nature. 1989; 342: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 15Kosako H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1994; 9: 2131-2138Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar) during Xenopus oocyte maturation. Indeed, microinjection of recombinant c-Mos is itself sufficient to induce oocyte maturation in the absence of hormonal treatment (16Yew N. Mellini M.L. Vande Woude G.F.

Science. 1989; 245: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), whereas CL100 (MAPK phosphatase-1) inhibits progesterone-induced maturation (18Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Dell K. Shirakabe K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25898-25904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Important work in Saccharomyces cerevisiaetoward the understanding of the control of the MAPK cascade has been undertaken in the last few years. The response to the mating pheromone signal is mediated by the direct interaction of the Gβ subunit of G protein heterotrimers to Ste20, a serine threonine kinase (19Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Activation of Ste20 results in activation of the MAPK kinase kinase Ste11, which allows the MAPK cascade to be turned on and results in MAPK (Kss1 and Fus3) activation (reviewed in Ref. 20Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 162-167Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). InXenopus oocytes, Gotoh et al. (18Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Dell K. Shirakabe K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25898-25904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) showed that microinjection of constitutively active Ste11 is able to efficiently induce the maturation process. Moreover, addition of the N-terminal regulatory domain of Ste11 to Xenopus extracts prevents a constitutive form of Ste20 from activating MAPK (21Polverino A. Frost J. Yang P. Hutchison M.

Understanding of their functional importance in signal transduction and in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is rapidly growing (see Refs. 22Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M.

We have cloned Xenopus PAKs and recently demonstrated that a member of this family is involved in regulation of the oocyte maturation process (1Faure S. Vigneron S. Dorée M. Morin N.

This suggests that the folding pattern, which is α-helix in trifluoroethanol (confirmed by CD measurement), does not correspond to the biologically relevant conformation(s) recognized by antibodies. The NMR structures of both peptides were thus determined in aqueous solution. These studies showed that the two peptides exhibit similar folding features, particularly in their C termini. This may explain in part the cross-reactive properties of the two peptides in aqueous solution. However, the retro-inverso analogue appears to be more rigid than the parent peptide and contains five atypical β-turns. This feature may explain why retro-inverso foot-and-mouth disease virus peptides are often better recognized than the parent peptide by anti-virion antibodies.

This feature may explain why retro-inverso foot-and-mouth disease virus peptides are often better recognized than the parent peptide by anti-virion antibodies. The major immunogenic site of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), 1The abbreviations used are: FMDV, foot-and-mouth disease virus; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RU, resonance unit; TFE, trifluoroethanol; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; r.m.s.d., root mean square difference. which is contained in the so-called G-H loop comprising amino acid residues 135–158 of capsid protein VP1 (viral capsid protein1), is located in a disordered region on the surface of the particle (1Acharya R. Fry E. Stuart D. Fox G. Rowlands D. Brown F. Nature. 1989; 337: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). A single inoculum of a peptide corresponding to this region usually elicits levels of neutralizing antibodies that protect guinea pigs against a severe challenge with the cognate virus (2Bittle J.L. Houghten R.A. Alexander H. Shinnick T.M. Sutcliffe J.C. Lerner R.A. Rowlands D.J. Brown F. Nature. 1982; 298: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In some instances, however, although the total reactivity of antibodies evaluated in immunochemical tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is high, the level of neutralizing antibodies is low. This important problem has generated numerous studies aimed at enhancing the immunogenicity of this peptide with the hope of developing a peptide construct that could be used successfully as a synthetic vaccine (3Brown F. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 243-248Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that antisera raised in rabbits against peptides corresponding to the sequence 141–159 of two variants of serotype A cross-reacted strongly with the corresponding retro-inverso analogue peptides. Most importantly, the retro-inverso analogues, also called retro all-D or retro-enantio peptides (4Chorev M. Goodman M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 266-273Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 5Merrifield R.B. Juvvadi P. Andreu D. Ubach J. Boman A. Boman H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3449-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), induced greater and longer-lasting antibody titers than did the respective parent peptides (6Muller S. Guichard G. Benkirane N. Brown F. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.P. Peptide Res. 1995; 8: 138-144PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed with the FP variant analogue (which contains Phe and Pro residues at positions 148 and 153, respectively) that a single inoculation of the retro-inverso peptide elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies that persisted longer than those induced against the corresponding L-peptide and protected guinea pigs challenged with the cognate virus (7Briand J.P Benkirane N. Guichard G. Newman J.F.E. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Brown F. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12545-12550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The enhanced immunogenic reactivities of retro-inverso analogues may result from their higher resistance to proteolysis in biological fluids (7Briand J.P Benkirane N. Guichard G. Newman J.F.E. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Brown F. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12545-12550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, this property does not explain why in immunochemical assays, retro-inverso peptides are often better recognized than the parent peptide by anti-virus, anti-protein, or anti-peptide antibodies with equilibrium affinity constants which can be increased by 10–100 in some instances (7Briand J.P Benkirane N. Guichard G. Newman J.F.E. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Brown F. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12545-12550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Guichard G. Benkirane N.

Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To better understand the structural basis for antigenic mimicry between the L-peptide and its retro-inverso analogue, Carver et al.(10Carver J.A. Esposito G. Viglino P. Fogolari F. Guichard G. Briand J.-P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Brown F. Mascagni P. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 569-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) recently analyzed the L- and retro-inverso peptides 141–159 of the SL variant (with Ser and Leu residues at positions 148 and 153) by NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular modelling. The NMR structures of the peptides were determined in trifluoroethanol-d2(TFE-d2) at different temperatures. As expected (because the retro-inverso and L-peptides share inherently chiral secondary structure elements) both peptides were found to wind in opposite directions. A detailed analysis of the results showed the presence of other different structural features between the peptides that exhibited only gross structural similarity. Thus, the L- and retro-inverso peptides maintain an approximately constant backbone conformation within the conserved RGD triplet (residues 145–147), which represents the principal site for virus attachment. However, the backbone of the RGD triplet is not equivalent in the L- and retro-inverso peptides. In the L-peptide, the RGD motif is enclosed in a type IV β-turn, whereas in the retro-inverso analogue it is part of a loose left-handed helix. Conformational variability is found about glycine 149 in both families of structures. Finally, a helical region encompasses residues 152–159 of the L-peptide and residues 150–159 of the retro-inverso analogue. In both cases, the helix is amphipathic but as indicated above, it is right-handed in the parent peptide and left-handed in the retro-inverso peptide analogue. Thus, a number of different structural features described for the L- and retro-inverso peptide 141–159 are particularly significant, and this observation does not support the fact that the retro-inverso peptide displays similar or superior cross-reactive antigenic activity compared with the L-peptide with regard to anti-virus or anti-protein antibodies. As suggested by Carveret al. (10Carver J.A. Esposito G. Viglino P. Fogolari F. Guichard G. Briand J.-P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Brown F. Mascagni P. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 569-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), this discrepancy could be explained by assuming that the structures of the peptides in TFE do not correspond to those assumed by each peptide in aqueous solutions used to test their antigenic reactivity or in vivo when their immunogenic activity is investigated. In an attempt to rationalize our previous biological findings and explain why the retro-inverso analogue mimics the antigenic activity of the parent peptide, we decided to test whether anti-virus and anti-peptide antibodies effectively react with the peptides in TFE and determine the preferred conformers of the L- and retro-inverso peptides in aqueous solution. Two natural (L-peptides) and two retro-inverso peptides corresponding to the VP1 region 141–159 of FMDV (serotype A, subtype 12, FP variant) were used in this study. The sequence of the parent peptide is 141GSGVRGDFGSLAPRVARQL159. This peptide contains the highly conserved RGD cell attachment site at residues 145–147. An additional cysteine residue was added at the N terminus of the peptides to allow their selective conjugation to the BIAcore sensor chips. CD and NMR studies were performed with peptides that contained no additional cysteine. The synthesis and purification of the peptides were described previously (6Muller S. Guichard G. Benkirane N. Brown F. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.P. Peptide Res. 1995; 8: 138-144PubMed Google Scholar, 7Briand J.P Benkirane N. Guichard G. Newman J.F.E. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Brown F. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12545-12550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the L-peptides was acetylated, whereas their C terminus was left as -COOH. With respect to the native sequence, the N terminus (Gly141) of the retro-inverso peptides was carboxamidated, and a 2-substituted malonic acid derivative was substituted for the native C-terminal L residue (7Briand J.P Benkirane N. Guichard G. Newman J.F.E. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Brown F. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12545-12550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because the malonic acid derivative was introduced as a race mate during the synthesis, two diastereoisomers were generated. They were separated by HPLC, and only the most antigenically active diastereoisomer, which was the most slowly eluted (6Muller S. Guichard G. Benkirane N. Brown F. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.P. Peptide Res. 1995; 8: 138-144PubMed Google Scholar), was considered in this study. The purity of the L- and retro-inverso peptides was greater than 90% as checked by analytical HPLC. Peptide identity was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry using a protein time-of-flight apparatus (Bruker GMBH, Bremen, Germany) and gave the expected results for all peptides (data not shown). Control experiments were carried out with the L- and retro-inverso peptides of sequence IRGERA. These peptides, as well as the anti-IRGERA monoclonal antibody 4x11, were described previously (8Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9765-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Benkirane N. Guichard G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Anti-peptide antibodies used in this study were described elsewhere (6Muller S. Guichard G. Benkirane N. Brown F. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.P. Peptide Res. 1995; 8: 138-144PubMed Google Scholar). They were raised either in guinea pigs immunized against the L- and retro-inverso peptides covalently conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin in the presence of aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant or in rabbits immunized with peptides coupled to small unilamellar liposomes containing monophosphoryl lipid A as adjuvant (6Muller S. Guichard G. Benkirane N. Brown F. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.P. Peptide Res. 1995; 8: 138-144PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in the ability of peptides to bind antibodies in the presence of increasing concentrations of TFE were measured using the Pharmacia BIAcore biosensor instrument (Pharmacia Biosensor, AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The conventional immobilization technique was used to couple the L- and the retro-inverso peptides to the sensor chips through their N-terminal thiol reactive groups (9Benkirane N. Guichard G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 267 and 185 pg of L- and retro-inverso peptides were respectively immobilized per mm2 (corresponding to 267 and 185 RU). After the peptide immobilization, the remaining reactive groups on the sensor surface were deactivated by a pulse with cysteine. The antibody preparation was then injected at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min during 4 min at 25 °C, and the response expressed in RU was measured. After dissociating the bound antibody from the peptide surface in the presence of HCl (20 μl; flow rate, 5 μl/min) and washing, 20 μl of TFE in HEPES buffer (12.5%, v/v) were injected at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min during 4 min at 25 °C. The peptide surface was then washed by injecting 10 μl of HEPES buffer (without TFE) at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min for 2 min at 25 °C, and then the antibody preparation in HEPES (20 μl) was injected as described above, and the RU was measured. The same series of steps was repeated for each TFE concentration (i.e. 25, 50, 75, and 100%). As a control, between each TFE step the peptide surface was regenerated (dissociation of the bound antibody) and washed, and the antibody was injected in HEPES without TFE. By measuring the RU between each step, we thus checked that the TFE treatment did not irreversibly alter the peptide surface reactivity. They were performed at room temperature on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter flushed with nitrogen. Spectra were recorded in a wavelength interval of 250–190 nm using a 1-mm path length rectangular cell. Each spectrum was the average of five scans taken at a scan rate of 50 nm/s with a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm and was corrected for base line using Jasco software. TFE titration was carried out by dissolving the lyophilized peptide trifluoroactetate salts in the appropriate solvent: (i) 0.1 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.7, and varying concentrations of TFE or (ii) 100% TFE. Typically, the peptide concentration was 0.2 mm. The results were expressed as mean residue ellipticity [Θ] having the units degrees·cm2·dmol−1 according to the relation [Θ] = Θλ/(100lcN), where Θλ is the measured ellipticity, l is the optical path length, c is the peptide concentration, andN is the number of amino acid residues in the sequence. For the NMR experiments, 3 mmpeptide was dissolved in 500 μl of phosphate buffer with 10% D2O, pH 5.7 (noncorrected). All NMR experiments were recorded at 285 K on a 400 MHz DRX-Bruker spectrometer. The following homonuclear two-dimensional experiments were recorded: double-quantum-filtered J-correlated spectroscopy and total correlation spectroscopy with a mixing time (τm) of 70 ms and NOE spectroscopy 32 with mixing times from 100 to 400 ms. Water suppression was achieved using the WATERGATE sequence (11Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar). Spectra were processed on Silicon Graphics Indy workstation using the XWINNMR 1.2 software (Bruker GMBH). Distance restraints were derived from cross-peak intensities of the NOE spectroscopy spectra with τm = 200 ms. Intensitiy of peaks was extracted from the NOE spectra using XEASY software (12Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar), and the interproton distances were calculated taking the distance of 1.78 Å between the two Pro153 δH protons as a reference. Distance restraints were assigned as strong, medium, and weak and set at intervals of 1.8–2.5, 2.5–3.5, and 3.5–5.5 Å, respectively. Φ dihedral angles were restrained within the −170, −10] and 10, 170 intervals for the parent and retro-inverso peptides, respectively. DYANA-1.4 software (13Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) was used to run the structure calculations: sets of 50 structures were initially calculated based on 37 and 41 inter-residues distance restraints for parent and retro-inverso peptides, respectively, following the torsion angle dynamics procedure. Refinement with restrained minimization was then performed on the structures having the lowest energies, i.e. structures with target function typically below 1. We had to introduce d-amino acids in the DYANA library, changing signs of the z coordinates for all Hα and side chain atoms. The 2-isobutyl malonic acid residue was also introduced in the library, from the Leu residue, which was modified using the MOLMOL-2.5.1 software (14Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar). Two series of simulations were run with R and S conformers of 2-isobutyl malonic acid. Final refinement was run only on theS-2-isobutyl malonic acid because it led to less restraint violations. Changes in the ability of peptides (corresponding to the sequence of the FP variant) to bind antibodies were measured using a biosensor instrument based on surface plasmon resonance. The peptides were coupled to the sensor chips through their N-terminal thiol reactive groups. After immobilization of peptide and deactivation of any remaining reactive groups on the sensor surface by a pulse with cysteine, the antibody preparation was injected at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min during 4 min at 25 °C, and the response expressed in RU was measured. After dissociating the bound antibody from the peptide surface in the presence of HCl and washing, TFE in HEPES buffer (12.5%, v/v) was injected at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min during 4 min at 25 °C. The peptide surface was then washed by injecting HEPES buffer (without TFE) at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min during 2 min at 25 °C; the antibody preparation in HEPES (20 μl) was then injected as described above, and the RU was measured. The same series of steps was repeated for each TFE concentration (i.e. 25, 50, 75, and 100%). Control experiments performed to check that TFE treatment did not irreversibly alter the peptide surface reactivity are described under “Materials and Methods.” This protocol allowed us to study the effect of TFE on the antigenicity of the peptides without affecting the reactivity of antibodies that remained in the standard HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. The data presented in Fig. 1 illustrate the reactivity of guinea pig and rabbit antibodies raised against the parent and retro-inverso peptides 141–159 with the L-peptide and its retroenantiomer as a function of TFE concentration. A slight decrease in antibody binding was observed when the peptides were in 12.5% TFE, and a sharp drop of binding was found when peptides were in 25–50% TFE. In general, guinea pig (Fig. 1, a and b) and rabbit (Fig. 1, c and d) antibodies did not react or reacted very weakly with peptides in 75 and 100% TFE. A control experiment with the hexapeptide of sequence IRGERA, known to remain unordered in 100% TFE (15Benkirane N. Friede M. Guichard G. Briand J.-P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26279-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was performed in parallel. Using a monoclonal antibody induced against the L-hexapeptide (9Benkirane N. Guichard G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the protocol described above, no change in antibody binding was found when the parent and retro-inverso IRGERA peptides were in HEPES or in HEPES containing 12.5–100% TFE (Fig. 1 e). These results indicate that our procedure does not affect the reactivity of the antibody itself and that changes in antibody binding are only observed when the structure of the peptide becomes an α-helix in the presence of TFE. Interestingly, in another study (16Lang E. Szendrei G.I. Lee V.M.Y. Otvos L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 170: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it was shown in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that when the native structure of peptides is an α-helix, certain monoclonal antibodies react better with the peptides dried from TFE onto the solid phase than with the same peptides adsorbed in aqueous solution. Fig. 2 shows that when the parent and retro-inverso FMDV peptides were in 50% TFE, the time required to restore the structure recognized by antibodies was between 5 and 7 min in HEPES buffer at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min. It is possible that when the dextran-linked parent and retro-inverso FMDV peptides are exposed to TFE, due to the local peptide density on the dextran matrix and the tendency of this FMDV peptide to form an amphipathic α-helix in TFE (10Carver J.A. Esposito G. Viglino P. Fogolari F. Guichard G. Briand J.-P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Brown F. Mascagni P. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 569-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), helix bundle structures are formed, and a strong secondary structure stabilizing effect is exerted, explaining that several minutes (and not milliseconds) are required to induce the folding to unfolding transition in aqueous solution. Such a stabilizing effect has been described by Mutter et al. (17Mutter M. Tuchscherer G.G. Miller C. Altmann K.H. Carey R.I. Wyss D.F. Labbardt A.M. Rivier J.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1463-1469Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar) with template-assembled synthetic peptides involving helical peptides. In summary, these results indicate very clearly that antibodies from immunized animals do not bind the L- and retro-inverso peptides 141–149 when they adopt an α-helical conformation. Furthermore the antibody reactivity was completely restored after a few minutes (>5) when the sensor chip-immobilized peptides were placed in a TFE-free buffer. The conformational features of both the L- and the retro-inverso peptides were investigated in solution by CD spectroscopy. An overlay of the CD spectra of the L- and retro-inverso peptides (0.2 mm) in 0.1 mphosphate buffer solution at pH 5.7 and in TFE is shown in Fig.3 a. As expected, both peptides exhibited almost symmetrical CD curves in phosphate buffer solution as well as in TFE. In aqueous solution, the spectra showed only a strong Cotton effect at 197 nm ([Θ] = −1.08 × 104 and 1.04 × 104 for the L- and the retro-inverso peptides, respectively). Although such a CD signature is often assigned to a random-coil structure (18Alder A.J. Greenfield N.J. Fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 675-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 19de Prat-Gay G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), Siligardi et al. (20Siligardi G. Drake A.F. Mascagni P. Rowlands D.J. Brown F. Gibbons W.A. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1991; 38: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) argued for an equilibrium between a limited number of secondary structures that may include a left-handed extended helical conformation. In TFE, both the isomeric L- and retro-inverso peptides presented the typical pattern that can be assigned to the α-helical conformation, with a trough at 222 nm and an extremum around 205 nm. However, in the case of the retro-inverso peptide, the intensity of the Cotton effect at 222 nm was stronger ([Θ] = +6.20 × 103 versus−4.49 × 103 calculated for the L-peptide). This result is in good agreement with previous NMR investigations performed in TFE-d2 on a related antigenic peptide (variant SL), which revealed that the helical region present in the C-terminal half (with respect to the parent sequence) of both peptides is more defined in the retro-inverso isomer (10Carver J.A. Esposito G. Viglino P. Fogolari F. Guichard G. Briand J.-P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Brown F. Mascagni P. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 569-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Pegna M. Molinari H. Zetta L. Melacini G. Gibbons W.A. Brown F. Rowlands D. Chan E. Mascagni P. J. Peptide Sci. 1996; 2: 91-105PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the structural behavior of the retro-inverso isomer in solution, an H2O/TFE solvent titration was performed at room temperature. The presence of a plateau between 25 and 75% TFE, clearly deduced from the plot of Θ at 222 nm versus TFE concentration (Fig. 3 b), is indicative of a folding-unfolding pathway between three stable conformational components. It is worth noting that two plateaux and four conformational states were observed by Siligardi et al. (20Siligardi G. Drake A.F. Mascagni P. Rowlands D.J. Brown F. Gibbons W.A. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1991; 38: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in TFE titration of the related L-peptide encompassing residues 141–160 (variant SL) with a free N terminus. From our data, it appears that the retro-inverso isomer described in the present study shares similar conformational features with the L-peptides corresponding to variants SL and LP studied by Siligardi et al., which also involved a three-state process and a higher helical content in 100% TFE compared with the FP L-peptide (20Siligardi G. Drake A.F. Mascagni P. Rowlands D.J. Brown F. Gibbons W.A. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1991; 38: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Siligardi G. Drake A.F. Mascagni P. Rowlands D. Brown F. Gibbons W.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, during TFE titration of the retro-inverso peptide, Siligardi et al.observed two isodichroic points at 197 and 203 nm, which were not found in our case. The finding that some major conformational changes already occur when both the L- and retro-inverso peptides are in 5–25% TFE is in good agreement with the drop in antibody binding observed when the peptides were studied in this range of TFE concentration in mixed TFE buffer solutions (Fig. 1). The results presented above strongly suggest that the folding pattern in the α-helix observed in TFE for both the L- and retro-inverso peptides does not in fact correspond to the biologically relevant conformation(s) recognized by antibodies. It was thus decided to re-examine by NMR the structures of the L- and retro-inverso peptides in aqueous solution and in the absence of TFE. NMR data for both L- and retro-inverso peptides were collected on a DRX-400 spectrometer (Bruker) in aqueous solution (phosphate buffer, pH 5.7). A summary of NOE connectivities observed in the NMR spectra used for structure calculations of both peptides is shown in Fig.4. The parent peptide 141–159 was found to be very flexible, and the NMR data then corresponded to a conformational averaging. However, the N and C termini exhibited different behavior that were analyzed using the program PROMOTIF (23Hutchinson G. Thornton J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). It was found that the N-terminal region (residues 141–149) was very flexible and contained no particular local structural motif. On the contrary, the C-terminal part (residues 150–159) appeared to be more rigid, with two distorted β-turns, although no permanent hydrogen bond was observed. The first β-turn involves residues 155–158 and is present in 81% of the structures obtained from the final run of DYANA calculations (Fig. 5). The second one involves residues 156–159 in 41% of the structures. TableI summarizes angle values andC α(i) − C α(i+3) distances observed for these turns, and a superposition of the 10 structures with the best target functions is shown in Fig.6 a. The optimal fit of the backbone atoms corresponds to the sequence 150–158 and yields to a root mean square difference (r.m.s.d.) of 0.96 Å, whereas the 144–148 region (containing the RGD motif) gives an r.m.s.d. of 1.2 Å.Figure 5β-Turns found in the parent and retro-inverso peptides and frequency of occurrence.

Molinari H. Zetta L. Melacini G. Gibbons W.A. Brown F. Rowlands D. Chan E. Mascagni P. J. Peptide Sci. 1996; 2: 91-105PubMed Google Scholar) have reported the NMR structures of two VP1 peptides 141–160 (variants FP and SL) in TFE. Both peptides exhibited a helical motif from residues 151–158 and a loop encompassing the RGD motif (residues 145–147), whereas our results obtained in aqueous solution are rather in favor of two β-turns in the 155–159 region. Therefore, it appears that TFE is promoting a helical structure in the 141–159 (160) sequence. On the other hand it is notable that in good agreement with the results obtained in TFE by Pegna et al. (21Pegna M. Molinari H. Zetta L. Melacini G. Gibbons W.A. Brown F. Rowlands D. Chan E. Mascagni P. J. Peptide Sci. 1996; 2: 91-105PubMed Google Scholar), we could not find any particular element of secondary structure in the N-terminal part of the peptide (Figs. 5and 6 a). The retro-inverso peptide 141–159 was subjected to the same NMR study in aqueous solution. Again, no permanent hydrogen bond was observed, but the analysis of the torsional angles and above all theC α(i) − C α(i+3) distances revealed five atypical β-turns (TableII). As in the parent peptide, the C-terminal part of the retro-inverso peptide is folded by two β-turns involving residues 156–159 (56% occurrence; Fig. 5) and residues 155–158 (30% occurrence). Two other β-turns are also present in the central region of the peptide surrounding residues 150–151 and 152–153 with frequencies of 30 and 43%, respectively. Finally, the RGD motif is also involved in a β-turn present in 10% of the structures. Fig. 6 b shows the optimal superposition of the backbone atoms for the 10 structures with the lowest target functions. The best fit corresponds to the sequence 150–158 and yields to an r.m.s.d. of 0.8 Å. We also measured an r.m.s.d. of 0.9 Å on the positions of the backbone atoms for the sequence 144–148, containing the RGD motif. Carver et al. (10Carver J.A. Esposito G. Viglino P. Fogolari F.

In contrast our results show that in aqueous solution, these two regions are involved in β-turns, illustrating again the helical promoter role of TFE. These conformational changes could explain why the parent and retro-inverso peptides are not recognized by antibodies when the peptides are in TFE.Table IIAngle values and Cα(i)Cα(i+3) range of β-turns in retro-inverso peptide structuresres. 1res. 2res. 3res. 4Φ2Ψ2Φ3Ψ3d(Cα1Cα2)%degreesÅ156157158159112 ± 45−7 ± 62117 ± 3870 ± 824.8–6.956155156157158155 ± 40−128 ± 40112 ± 45−7 ± 625.0–7.03015115215315447 ± 14−99 ± 12−178 ± 56.6–7.043149150151152134 ± 46−113 ± 19134 ± 1846 ± 486.4–7.030145146147148135 ± 48−38 ± 76163 ± 13−59 ± 446.4–6.910res., amino acid residue. Open table in a new tab res., amino acid residue. Very few studies describing the structures of a peptide and its retro-enantiomer have been reported so far (10Carver J.A. Esposito G. Viglino P.

Soc. 1997; 119: 5321-5328Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been generally observed that the structures of L-peptides and their respective retro-inverso analogues are similar but not identical. The best topochemical similarity was achieved with a cyclo hairpin peptide and its retroenantiomer (24Higgins K.A. Bicknell W. Keah H.H. Hearn M.T. J. Peptide Res. 1997; 50: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Likewise, in the present study, only the C-terminal regions of the FMDV peptides, covering the residues 156–159, could be superposed (Fig.7). Although the CO-NH bonds are in opposite directions, the peptide backbones in this region assume closely similar conformations, and the side chains adopt the same orientation. This similarity may explain in part the cross-reaction of antibodies with these two peptides. Another important finding is that the retro-inverso analogue appears to be significantly more rigid than the parent peptide in aqueous solution, particularly in the region 145–154, which is unstructured and mobile in the parent peptide (Fig.5). This feature supports our previous observation that the retro-inverso peptide 141–159 is better recognized than the parent peptide by anti-VP1 and anti-virus antibodies (6Muller S. Guichard G. Benkirane N. Brown F. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.P. Peptide Res. 1995; 8: 138-144PubMed Google Scholar, 7Briand J.P Benkirane N. Guichard G. Newman J.F.E. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Brown F. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12545-12550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported that β-turns in antigenic peptides are the feature most commonly seen in peptide-antibody complex structures (26Scherf T. Hiller R. Naider F. Levitt M. Anglister J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6884-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,27Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The three additional β-turns found in the retroenantio structure (Fig. 5) represent putative important nucleation sites that may be retained and further stabilized or rearranged into different structures when the peptide interacts with the antibody paratope. As far as the FMDV sequence studied in this work is concerned, our findings thus suggest that the retro-inverso strategy has proven to be useful not because it allowed the generation of a peptide whose surface closely mimics the L-peptide or the cognate region in the virus, but rather because it reduced the conformational space available to the peptide when it binds to the corresponding antibody. In this respect, a detailed comparison of the L- and retroenantiomeric peptide structures in contact with the paratope of specific monoclonal antibodies will be of considerable interest.

This domain is responsible for initiating trimerization of type X collagen during biosynthesis. We have built a molecular model of the NC1 domain trimer based on the crystal structure coordinates of the highly homologous trimeric domain of ACRP30 (adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDa or AdipoQ). Mapping of the MCDS mutations onto the structure reveals two specific clusters of residues as follows: one on the surface of the monomer which forms a tunnel through the center of the assembled trimer and the other on a patch exposed to solvent on the exterior surface of each monomeric unit within the assembled trimer. Biochemical studies on recombinant trimeric NC1 domain show that the trimer has an unusually high stability not exhibited by the closely related ACRP30. The high thermal stability of the trimeric NC1 domain, in comparison with ACRP30, appears to be the result of a number of factors including the 17% greater total buried solvent-accessible surface and the increased numbers of hydrophobic contacts formed upon trimerization. The 27 amino acid sequence present at the amino terminus of the NC1 domain, which has no counterpart in ACRP30, also contributes to the stability of the trimer. We have also shown that NC1 domains containing the MCDS mutations Y598D and S600P retain the ability to homotrimerize and heterotrimerize with wild type NC1 domain, although the trimeric complexes formed are less stable than those of the wild type molecule. These studies suggest strongly that the predominant mechanism causing MCDS involves a dominant interference of mutant chains on wild type chain assembly.

Thomas J.T. Super M. Evans G. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 169-178PubMed Google Scholar). An intriguing finding is that virtually all of the mutations causing MCDS occur within the carboxyl-terminal non-collagenous NC1 domain of type X collagen (Ref.19Wallis G.A. Rash B. Sykes B. Bonaventure J. Maroteaux P. Zabel B. Wynnedavies R. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). The only two MCDS mutations not found in the NC1 domain affect the putative signal peptide cleavage site upstream of the non-collagenous domain 2 in the molecule (20Ikegewara S. Nakamura K. Nagano A. Haga N. Nakamura Y. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The role of the carboxyl-terminal non-collagenous domain of most collagens (including type X) in initiating intracellular α-chain selection, assembly, and helix formation is well established (Refs. 8Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and 21Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and references therein). Assembly studies based on cell-free translation of recombinant RNA encoding wild type and MCDS transcripts of type X collagen suggest that mutant chains do not interfere with the trimerization of the wild type protein based on SDS-PAGE assays (22Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. Mc Quillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the suggestion that the phenotype of MCDS is best explained by haplo-insufficiency. In support of this hypothesis, in one individual with MCDS, only wild type mRNA for type X collagen could be detected in the growth plate, suggesting that the mutant transcript is unstable and rapidly degraded (23Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, haplo-insufficiency is in discord with the clustering of both point and frameshift mutations in the NC1 domain of type X collagen; in haplo-insufficiency one would expect to find MCDS-causing frameshift mutations to be randomly distributed through the gene (19Wallis G.A. Rash B. Sykes B. Bonaventure J. Maroteaux P. Zabel B. Wynnedavies R. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The non-random clustering of MCDS mutations in the NC1 domain is more consistent with a mechanism involving dominant interference in which the mutant chains retain the ability to trimerize. It is possible that previous investigations have failed to detect trimerization of chains containing MCDS mutations due to the harsh assay conditions, such as SDS-PAGE, that have been employed. The crystal structure of the NC1-like domain of ACRP30, a protein closely related to type X collagen, has been recently solved at 2.1-Å resolution (24Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have therefore performed molecular modeling of the NC1 domain, based on the ACRP30 crystal structure coordinates, to gain greater insight into the structural basis of MCDS. The model reveals that the MCDS mutations are localized to two specific regions of the folded monomeric NC1 domain and that many of the MCDS mutations may not totally abolish the ability of affected chains to trimerize. Mutagenesis experiments, based on information obtained from the model, demonstrate that NC1 domains containing specific MCDS mutations retain the ability to form trimers and provide an explanation for the unusually high thermal stability exhibited by the assembled NC1 trimer. The amino acid sequence of the NC1 domain of human type X collagen was used to probe EMBL, GenBankTM, SwissProt and PIR data bases as well as data base updates using the advanced BLAST 2.0 search (25Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). We used a cut-off expectancy value (E) of 1 (such that no more than 1 match is expected to be found merely by chance, according to the stochastic model of Karlin and Altschul (26Karlin S. Altschul S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2264-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar)) and a gapped alignment using the Blosum 62 matrix (27Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4284) Google Scholar). Multalin (28Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4275) Google Scholar) was used to re-align the resulting 25 sequences using the Blosum 62 matrix using a penalty of 12 for gap opening and 2 for gap extending. None of the resulting aligned sequences have three-dimensional structures in the Brookhaven data base. All molecular modeling was performed on an R5000 O2 Silicon graphics workstation using QUANTA® and CHARMm 23.1® programs. The three–dimensional model of the NC1 domain of type X collagen was built based on the coordinates of human ACRP30. 2L. Shapiro, personal communication from Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York. The file containing the coordinates was rewritten manually to make a Protein Data Base file format that could be imported by QUANTA®. A homology model was built by copying the coordinates of the backbone of the ACRP30 trimer and the coordinates of identical residues in the type X collagen NC1 domain. The remaining side chains were built in the Protein Design module using the Ponder and Richards' rotamer library. Disordered loops in the crystal structure of ACRP30 (loop G-H in M1 and loops G-H and A-A′ in M2) were modeled where possible by overlaying the intact loop of a corresponding part of one of the other two monomers. This left a gap between Glu658 to Gly661 (corresponding to Asp224 to Gly 228 in ACRP30) in each monomer. The resulting trimer of the NC1 domain of type X collagen was energy-minimized (using the steepest descents followed by Newton-Raphson algorithm) to gradient convergence (<0.01 root mean square) removing bad steric and electrostatic contacts. The water molecules from the crystal structure were overlaid, and those internal to the trimer were incorporated into the model. The Protein Health module in QUANTA was used to check the integrity of the model using a Ramachandran map and to identify buried hydrophilic or exposed hydrophobic residues. The solvent-accessible surfaces of monomers and assembled trimers were calculated to estimate the surface area buried upon trimerization. The local environment of each residue on the interfaces was examined to locate those residues important for the trimer structure. The interfaces are not symmetric, because of a slight twist and stagger to the arrangement of the β-sandwich monomers (24Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Particular attention was given to the position of those residues in the NC1 model trimer that differed in ACRP30 and related proteins (see Fig.1).Figure 1Sequence alignment of C1q–like domains with a BLAST 2.0 Evalue of less than 0.015. BLAST 2.0 was used to probe the data bases with the NC1 domain of type X collagen sequence and retrieved 58 sequences with an E value less than 10. After discarding redundancy we aligned 25 sequences in Multalin using the Blosum 62 matrix and default penalty values. Those residues in red are conserved throughout the alignment; those in blue are conserved in at least 70% of sequences, and those highlighted in yellow show the MCDS point mutations. β-Strand topology is taken from ACRP30 and TNF nomenclature; ca1a_human, human type X collagen (Swiss-Prot accession number Q03692); ca1a_bovin, bovine type X collagen (Swiss-Prot accession number P3206); ca1a_mouse, murine type X collagen (Swiss-Prot accession number Q00780); ca1a_chick, gallus gallus type X collagen (Swiss-Prot accession number P08125); ca28_mouse, murine α2 type VIII collagen (Swiss-Prot accession number P25318); ca28_human, human α2 type VIII collagen (Swiss-Prot accession number P25067); ca18_rabbit, rabbit α1 type VIII collagen (Swiss-Prot accession number P14282); ca18_human, human α1 type VIII collagen (Swiss-Prot accession number P27658); ca18_mouse, murine α1 type VIII collagen (Swiss-Prot accession number Q00780); acr3_human, human adipocyte complement-related protein (Swiss-Prot accession number Q15848); acr3_mouse, murine adipocyte complement-related protein (Swiss-Prot accession number Q60994); cole_lepma, lepomis macrochirusinner ear-specific collagen (Swiss-Prot accession number P98085); hp27_tamas, chipmunk hibernation-associated protein (Swiss-Prot accession number Q06577); hp25_tamas, chipmunk hibernation-associated protein (Swiss-Prot accession number Q06576); hp20_tamas, chipmunk hibernation-associated protein (Swiss-Prot accession number Q06575); c1qc_mouse, murine C1q C chain (Swiss-Prot accession number Q02105); c1qc_human, human C1q C chain (Swiss-Prot accession number P02747); c1qb_mouse, murine C1q B chain (Swiss-Prot accession number P14106); c1qb_rat, rat C1q B chain (Swiss-Prot accession number P31721); c1qb_human, human C1q B chain (Swiss-Prot accession number P02746); c1qa_mouse, murine C1q A chain (Swiss-Prot accession number P98086); c1qa_human, human C1q A chain (Swiss-Prot accession number P02745); cerl_rat, rat cerebellin (Swiss-Prot accession number P23436); cerb_human, human cerebellin 1 (Swiss-Prot accession number P23435); multimerin_h, human multimerin (Swiss-Prot accession numberA57384).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA constructs were generated by PCR from the lambda genomic COL10A1 clone, HX3 (5Thomas J.T.

DNA encoding the entire human type X collagen NC1 domain was amplified using the primers 5′-CCAGGTCAAGCACATATGCCTGAGGGT-3′ (primer A, sense nucleotides 1550–1563), which incorporates an NdeI site (C (A/T)ATG) in-frame with the Met521 codon of the NC1 domain, and 5′-GGGGTGTACTCACATTGGAGCCAC-3′ (primer B, antisense nucleotides 2028–2052), which incorporates the stop codon and 9 base pairs of the 3′-untranslated region. To generate the extended reporter construct, DNA encoding the entire NC1 domain and upstream DNA encoding the 11 most carboxyl-terminal Gly-X-Y repeats of the collagenous domain was generated by PCR. A sense oligonucleotide of sequence 5′-CCAGCTCATATGGCAACTAAGGGCCTC-3′ (nucleotides 1429–1455), which incorporates an NdeI site coding for an in-frame Met codon at the amino terminus of the extended NC1 coding region, was used together with the antisense primer B. To produce the truncated NC1 translation construct, DNA encoding a portion of the NC1 domain from the Met549 codon to the stop codon was generated by PCR using the sense primer 5′-GGGGTAACACATATGCCTGTGTCT-3′ (nucleotides 1632–1656) together with the antisense primer B. To create constructs containing MCDS and related point mutations, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the PCR-based single overlap extension procedure described elsewhere (29Ling M.M. Robinson B.H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 157-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides A and B (described above) and mutagenic oligonucleotides (nucleotides 1875–1899) sense, 5′-CCAGGAATATACTTTTTTTCATAC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GTATGAAAAAAAGTATATTCCTGG-3′ for Y598F; sense, 5′-CCAGGAATATACGCTTTTTCATAC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GTATGAAAAAGCGTATATTCCTGG-3′ for Y598A; 5′-CCAGGAATATACGATTTTTCATAC- 3′ and antisense, 5′-GTATGAAAAATCGTATATTCCTGG-3′ for Y598D; and (nucleotides 1881–2004) sense, 5′-ATATACGCTTTTCCATACCACGTG-3′ and antisense, 5′-CACGTGGTATGGAAAAGCGTATAT-3′ for S600P. The resulting PCR fragments were cloned into the T/A cloning vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). Constructs generating sense RNA upon transcription from the T7 promoter were identified by restriction mapping and sequenced. In vitro expression was carried out using the TNT T7 polymerase-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 1 μg of each purified construct was expressed in 40 μl of TNT premix containing 2 μl of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) made up to a final volume of 50 μl with sterile distilled water. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. 5-μl aliquots of in vitro expression reaction were added to 10 μl of sample buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8 (room temperature), 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue; the concentration of SDS in the sample buffer was either 10% (w/v) or 0.75% (w/v) as indicated under “Results”). Where heating is indicated, samples were overlaid with 20 μl of mineral oil and incubated at the appropriate temperature for 5 min using Perkin-Elmer 480 thermal cycler prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. All samples were resolved on standard 12 or 16% PAGE gels containing 0.1% SDS according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed (10% (v/v) acetic acid containing 10% (v/v) methanol) for 30 min and washed twice in 30% (v/v) methanol containing 3% (v/v) glycerol. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak Biomax Film, or, if quantitation was required, phosphorimaged (Fuji-Bas). In vitro translations containing labeled NC1 domains were subjected to centrifugation at 109,000 ×g for 1 h to remove particulates. 50 μl of the supernatant was then dialyzed against NET buffer overnight (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA). 5 μl of hybridoma medium containing the X34 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a conformation-dependent epitope in the NC1 domain of native type X collagen (31Girkontaite I. Frischholz S. Lammi P. Wagner K. Swoboda B. Aigner T. Von der Mark K. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), was added to the dialyzed translation followed by incubation for 16 h at 4 °C with gentle inversion. Following the incubation, 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for a further 4 h, after which the protein A-Sepharose was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g (control incubations were carried out in the absence of X34). The pelleted protein A-Sepharose was washed in 500 μl of 1× NET buffer three times followed by resuspension in sample buffer containing 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Prior to SDS-PAGE analysis, the samples were heated for 2 min at 68 °C. The complete NC1 domain of human type X collagen was aligned with the carboxyl-terminal non-collagenous domain of mouse ACRP30 (Fig. 2). The type X collagen NC1 domain contains an extra 27 residues at the amino terminus that are not present in ACRP30 and a deletion of ACRP30-Tyr219. The globular domain of ACRP30 exhibits 40% identity and 65% similarity with the equivalent region of the type X collagen NC1 domain. Overlaying the secondary structural elements from the crystal structure of ACRP30 on the alignment revealed that those residues forming β-strands of ACRP30 were mostly conserved in the NC1 domain, whereas differences were predominantly localized to the loop regions (Fig. 2). Therefore, the secondary structural elements are highly conserved. Within the β-strands, those residues forming the hydrophobic core of the monomer of ACRP30 (see below) are particularly conserved. This conservation strongly indicates that the tertiary fold of the NC1 domain is identical to the β-sandwich of ACRP30. In addition, the conservation of key interface residues between monomers (see below and Fig. 2) indicates that the quaternary structures of these two proteins are similar. This pattern of conservation, based on alignments, also holds across the complete family of related proteins including collagen types X and VIII, C1q, ACRP30, hibernation protein and cerebellin (see Fig. 1). A model of the trimeric NC1 domain (Fig. 3) was built using the three-dimensional coordinates of trimeric ACRP30 based on the alignment shown in Fig. 2. The amino-terminal 27 residues of the NC1 domain of type X collagen were not included in the model since there is no equivalent sequence in ACRP30 (Fig. 2). The 8 loop regions in the NC1 domain were modeled on the ACRP30 structure since their lengths are conserved, and they are anchored spatially by the β-strands. Upon trimerization (Fig. 3 a), the mode of packing between the NC1 monomer subunits produces a tight association contributed to by the loss of solvent-accessible surface and hence providing a free energy gain. The total buried solvent-accessible surface of the NC1 domain on trimerization is 6222 Å2, compared with 5324 Å2 for ACRP30. The three monomers pack together forming a twisted tunnel that extends through the core of the structure. The hydrophobic contacts that produce the close packing between the NC1 monomers are identical or show only conservative changes with respect to ACRP30. These include Ala553, Ile557, Leu575, Ile596, Val621, Ile641, Phe675, and Ala678 in the NC1 domain. However, in the NC1 domain additional residues (Pro550, Val551, Val668, and Pro679) contribute to hydrophobic interfaces between monomers. The equivalent residues in ACRP30 are Tyr114, Arg115, Asn233 and His244, respectively. Pro550, Val551, Ile641, Phe675, and Pro679 form a hydrophobic plug at the base of the NC1 trimer tunnel as viewed in Fig. 3 b. Moving up from the base, the trimer tunnel surface, contributed by all three monomers, becomes more polar with Tyr598, Ser600, Ser639, and Ser671 forming a dense network of hydrogen bonds with each other and water molecules (e.g. see Fig. 3 c). These polar residues are conserved across the entire family of type X collagen-related proteins (Fig. 1). Examining the monomer-monomer interfaces is complicated by the asymmetric association of the three monomers (designated M1—M3; see Fig. 3 a). Significant monomer-monomer contacts include a backbone hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr623 and the amide nitrogen of His669(between M2–M3 and M3–M1). M1–M2 has a different backbone contact involving the carbonyl oxygen of Gly631 and the amide nitrogen of Leu633. Examination of the NC1 trimer model revealed that the hydrophobic side chains of Pro568, Pro570, Ile588, Trp611, and Trp651 are exposed to solvent on the external surface of the trimer. All NC1 domain residues that are affected by single amino acid substitutions causing MCDS were displayed simultaneously on the monomer (Fig.3 d) and trimer (Fig. 3 e) models revealing a striking clustering of position. The substituted residues are localized to two distinct regions. The side chains of residues that are substituted in MCDS either form the polar and hydrogen-bonded region within the trimer tunnel (e.g. Tyr598 and Ser600, see Fig. 3 c) or form a patch on the external surface of the monomer/trimer assembled from part of loop D–E and part of β-strand G (Figs. 1 and 2). A detailed summary of the location and orientation of amino acid residues substituted within the NC1 domain in MCDS is presented in TableI.Table IPredicted location and orientation of NC1 domain amino acid substitutions causing MCDSPoint mutationPosition of residue and direction of side chainComments on wild type residue orientationY597HaIndicates residues located in a cluster on an interior patch.On β-strand C, interior face of trimer, side chain pointing to interior of monomerOH group hydrogen bonds to Ser552 via waterY598DaIndicates residues located in a cluster on an interior patch.On β-strand C, interior face of trimer, side chain pointing into trimer tunnelOH group forms pyramidal geometry with 2 other Tyr598 and a water molecule (see Fig. 3)S600PaIndicates residues located in a cluster on an interior patch.On β-strand C, interior face of trimer, side chain pointing into trimer tunnelOH groups from 3 monomers form a network of H bonds both with water and directly connecting the three monomers via Ser671 and Ser639.

As described for the mouse liver, male and female rat liver expressed kinetically distinct forms of aldehyde oxidase. Our data suggest that the two forms arise as a result of differences in redox state and are most simply explained by expression of a single gene encoding aldehyde oxidase in rats. In support of this argument we have sequenced cDNAs from male and female rat liver. We examined mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis with RNA from males and females, from several tissues, and following androgen induction. Purified rat liver enzyme from males or females revealed a single 150-kDa species consistent with cDNA sequence analysis. Both male and female forms were reactive to the same carboxyl-terminal directed antisera.K m(app) values obtained in crude extracts of male or female rat liver and post-benzamidine-purified aldehyde oxidase differed substantially from each other but could be interconverted by chemical reduction with dithiothreitol or oxidation with 4,4′-dithiodipyridine. Our data indicate that a single gene is most likely expressed in male or female rat liver and that the kinetic differences between male and female rat liver aldehyde oxidases are sensitive to redox manipulation.

Native AOX is routinely prepared as a homodimer of 300 kDa. Each 150-kDa subunit contains two iron-sulfur centers, an FAD, and the molybdenum-pterin cofactor (MoCo) (1Hille R. Massey V. Spiro T.G.

AOX (EC 1.2.3.1) catalyzes the oxidation of a wide range of aldehydic compounds, purines, quinoliniums, and numerous pharmacologic agents. While substrate specificity for AOX is very broad, and wide species variation in substrate specificity exists, the general catalytic reaction takes the form of hydroxyl transfer from water to an aldehyde creating the cognate acid. For example, conversion of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid is a very efficient reaction for AOX from most species. Conversion of N-1-methyl nicotinamide (NMN) to the 2- or -4-pyridone has been used as a standard definition of AOXs, although it is usually a kinetically less efficient reaction than benzaldehyde oxidation.AOX is of interest both for its role in drug metabolism and as a source of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide, and the superoxide anion, that have been related to numerous human pathologies. The human gene encoding AOX has been linked to a rare form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although it is unknown if AOX encodes the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis locus itself (4Berger R. Mezey E.

The FeS, FAD, and MoCo cofactors comprise an internal electron transfer chain in which electrons are passed from the active site molybdenum center to the FeS centers and finally to FAD. Partial reduction of oxygen at the the reduced FAD site produces ROS. Unlike the related enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), AOX does not utilize NAD+ as a cofactor and therefore AOX does not undergo the classical “D-form” to “O-form” conversion characteristic of XDH (7Nishino T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Two distinct AOX activities have been reported for mouse liver (8Yoshihara S. Tatsumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hepatic AOX from male and female mice differed in K mand V max for use of the substrate, benzaldehyde. The male enzyme exhibited a K m of 40 μm while the female enzyme had a K m of 115.4 μm. The male V max was 423.7 nmol/min/mg of protein and the female enzyme was 203.0 nmol/min/mg of protein. Furthermore, male and female mouse AOX enzymes were dramatically regulated by testosterone. Treatment of female mice with testosterone proprionate (TP) converted both K m andV max values to the male pattern (8Yoshihara S. Tatsumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Previous work had shown that castration resulted in the loss of a male pattern with conversion to a female pattern and TP supplementation restored the male-specific pattern of AOX expression (9Holmes R.S. Biochem. Genet. 1979; 17: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This observation was consistent with early reports of androgenic regulation of mouse hepatic AOX (10Huff S.D. Chaykin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Greengard P. Quinn G.P. Teicher L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1271-1273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, regulation of mouse hepatic AOX by testosterone was found to be mediated by growth hormone (12Yoshihara S. Tatsumi K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) where, again, growth hormone supplementation was found to convertK m and V max of the female-specific pattern to a male-specific pattern. Nonetheless, when male and female hepatic AOXs were purified to homogeneity they revealed a single band of 150 kDa on SDS-PAGE analysis and a single active band on native PAGE (8Yoshihara S. Tatsumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). How the differences between male and female hepatic AOXs were generated remained unclear.Two distinct AOX activities were also purified from rat liver and identified as NMN oxidases I and II (13Ohkubo M. Fujimura S. Biochem. Int. 1982; 4: 353-358Google Scholar, 14Ohkubo M. Sakiyama S. Fujimura S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The two activities exhibited different K m values for the oxidation of NMN to either its 2- or 4-pyridone. These two activities also differed by pH optima, heat stability, and inhibitor sensitivity. NMN oxidases I and II were found to possess distinct kinetic parameters,K m and V max, for oxidation of several different substrates, including benzaldehyde and NMN. Furthermore, wide variation in K m has been observed between different species and between individual rat strains (15Felsted R.L. Chaykin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1274-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Beedham C. Bruce S.E. Critchley D.J. Al-Tayib Y. Rance D.J. Eur. J. Drug Met.

As was found for mice, rat hepatic AOX could be purified to homogeneity to yield a native enzyme of 300 kDa that resolved into two 150-kDa subunits by SDS-PAGE (13Ohkubo M. Fujimura S. Biochem. Int. 1982; 4: 353-358Google Scholar, 14Ohkubo M. Sakiyama S. Fujimura S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).AOX genes are widely expressed phylogenetically and in some organisms appear to arise from multigene families. Even the Archae express MoCo enzymes related to AOX (18Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R.

Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Two different AOX cDNA sequences were reported for corn plants that were themselves 83% identical (19Sekimoto H. Seo M.

Three cDNA sequences were reported for Arabidopsis thaliana (20Hoff T. Frandsen G.I. Rocher A. Mundy J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and tomato plants may also possess several AOX genes (21Ori N. Eshed Y. Pinto P. Paran I. Zamir D. Fluhr R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1019-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two AOX genes have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster, one encoding AOX and the other encoding the highly related pyridoxal oxidase (PO) which was identified as an AOX (22Dickinson W.J. Genetics. 1970; 66: 487-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Warner C.K. Watts D.T. Finnerty V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 180: 449-453Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Warner C.K. Finnerty V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 184: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sequences for AOX or PO in Drosophila have not been reported. Multiplicity in AOX genes was also reported for the mouse where independently segregating loci appeared to encode AOX enzymes with distinct electrophoretic mobilities and these were identified as AOX1 and AOX2 (9Holmes R.S. Biochem. Genet. 1979; 17: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Importantly, the different isozymes appeared to segregate as different AOX genetic loci under differential developmental and androgenic regulation. Human and bovine AOX sequences have been published that are approximately 82% identical, and a small fragment of a mouse AOX sequence was published (5Wright R.M. Vaitaitis G.M. Weigel L.K. Repine T.B. McManaman J.L. Repine J.E. Redox Report. 1995; 1: 313-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wright R.M. Vaitaitis G.M. Wilson C.M. Repine T.B. Terada L.S. Repine J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Rep. 1997; 8: 2343-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, second copies of the vertebrate AOX genes have not been cloned or sequenced. Therefore, while at least two or three AOX genes appear to exist in plants and flys, they have not been confirmed by sequence analysis in higher organisms. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA could be interpreted to suggest that only a single AOX gene was present in humans (28Terao M. Kurosaki M. Demontis S. Zanotta S. Garattini E. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Molecular characterization of AOX from the rat has not been reported. Because both forms of AOX appeared to be expressed in rat liver, we have examined expression of AOX genes from both male and female rat livers. We have confirmed the existence of two kinetically different forms of AOX in male and female rats. Sequence analysis of the corresponding cDNAs indicates that a single AOX gene is most likely activated in the liver in male and female rats. By Northern blot analysis, male and female rat liver RNA contained a single mRNA species that did not exhibit induction by TP. Purified rat liver AOX from males and females revealed a single 150-kDa band on SDS-PAGE. Present experiments suggest that a primary difference between male and female forms of AOX may lie in their respective redox states.DISCUSSIONIn the present work have assembled full-length sequences for AOX cDNAs from male and female rat liver. We examined expression of AOX by Northern blot analysis from males and females, from several tissues, and have examined the effect of androgen regulation. We purified AOX from rat livers of males and females and obtained a single 150-kDa band by SDS-PAGE analysis consistent with the deduced amino acid sequences from males or females of 1,333 amino acids and 147 kDa. Antisera raised against synthetic decapeptides reacted with AOX from males or females. Furthermore, K m(app) values for crude extracts of male or female rat liver and post-benzamidine purified AOX differed substantially but could be interconverted by chemical reduction with DTT or oxidation with 4,4′-DTDP.The deduced amino acid sequences for male and female rat liver AOX are 81 and 82% identical to human and bovine AOXs and are themselves 99.6% identical. They show excellent conservation in the domains attributed to iron, FAD, and MoCo binding. By this criterion, the rat AOXs clearly belong to the molybdenum iron-sulfur flavoproteins that include AOX, XDH, and XO. Furthermore, the rat AOXs conform to the domain models proposed for XDHs (7Nishino T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 30Sato A. Nishino T. Noda K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3534-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Amino acids critical for catalysis of this class of enzymes are conserved in the rat AOX sequences as they are in most other AOXs and XDHs. In particular, Glu-869 of the Mop enzyme is critical for catalysis and is conserved in nearly all XDHs and AOXs (see Ref. 21Ori N. Eshed Y. Pinto P. Paran I. Zamir D. Fluhr R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1019-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar for alignment of several sequences), including the two rat sequences reported here where it is found at amino acid 1265 in MoCo domain 5 (Fig. 2).We observed that the male and female cDNA sequences were not identical. While several arguments could be advanced to explain the differences, we suggest that the least tenable argument is for the expression of two different AOX genes in the livers of male and female rats. Nucleotide differences between males and females could arise during PCR amplification, cloning, or sequence analysis since this is also PCR based. The small number of differences observed between male and female sequences could also arise from allelic differences between males and females or simply from individual differences between rats. Sequence analysis of only one additional male cDNA uncovered two of the changes (nt 405 and 408) found between the male and female clones. The minimal number of differences found between males and females coupled with the individual variation already observed suggests that the differences are unlikely to represent expression of alternative genes. Furthermore, sequence polymorphism is a well described phenomenon in Drosophila XDH (32Keith T.P. Brooks L.D. Lewontin R.C. Martinez-Cruzado J.C. Rigby D.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1985; 2: 206-216PubMed Google Scholar, 33Riley M.A. Kaplan S.R. Veuille M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 56-69PubMed Google Scholar, 34Comeron J.M. Aguade M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15280-15285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Hoff T. Frandsen G.I. Rocher A. Mundy J. Biochim. Biophys.

Genet. 1981; 184: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and in plants these data are supported by multiple cDNA sequences of approximately 80% identity (19Sekimoto H. Seo M. Dohmae N. Takio K. Kamiya Y. Koshiba T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15280-15285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Hoff T. Frandsen G.I. Rocher A. Mundy J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that mice appear to express two AOX genes in the liver was not surprising (9Holmes R.S. Biochem. Genet. 1979; 17: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, genetic data derived in the mouse have not been supported yet by corresponding molecular data and few efforts have been made to establish AOX gene copy number in vertebrates. Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA failed to reveal second AOX genes in several vertebrates under conditions in which at least 80% identity would have produced hybridization (28Terao M. Kurosaki M. Demontis S. Zanotta S. Garattini E. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Northern blot analysis of AOX mRNA from male or female rats, and from several different tissues, demonstrated expression of a single 4,500 nt RNA. We did not observe variation in size or multiplicity of AOX mRNAs in the liver from males or females where kinetically distinct forms of AOX were identified. Furthermore, castration and/or testosterone supplementation resulted in no significant alteration in AOX mRNA abundance and we infer that testosterone does not appear to exert significant regulation of AOX mRNA abundance or form in the rat liver. We did observe surprisingly strong hybridization to an RNA of 2,500 nt that could be localized to the region from +1,682 to +2,217. While the identity of this RNA is unknown, it is too small to encode an AOX of 150 kDa. Thus, RNA analysis supports expression of a single AOX gene in the liver where post-translational events may be important for determining the differences between male and female kinetic variants.Interestingly, AOX-3 from A. thaliana encoded a protein of only 568 amino acids truncated at the amino terminus (20Hoff T. Frandsen G.I. Rocher A. Mundy J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It must differ from a true AOX because it cannot encode a protein capable of binding the full set of co-factors. AOX-3 from A. thalianashowed striking homology to AOX-1 and AOX-2 in the MoCo-binding region, confirming that it is indeed a member of the MH family. Confirmation that vertebrates encode such a protein would be of great interest since it may represent the RNA detected at 2,500 nt.Since our observations suggested that rats express a single AOX gene in the liver, we examined the possibility that redox status might underlie the differences in male and female variants. We found that partially purified crude extracts of male and female rat liver did indeed reveal different K m(app) variants of AOX. Reduction of crude extracts from males or females with DTT resulted in conversion to a single form. Subsequent reoxidation of the reduced AOX with 4,4′-DTDP resulted in conversion to a more female likeK m(app). Reduction or oxidation of post-benzamidine purified AOX also resulted in interconversion between the two extremes of K m(app) suggesting that the variants differed by their intrinsic oxidation state. Since DTT directly reduces protein disulfides to thiols while 4,4′-DTDP forms disulfides from thiols (35Grassetti D.R. Murray Jr., J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 119: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 36Eager K.R. Dulhunty A.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Cai S. Sauve R. J. Membr.

Macromol. 1997; 20: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we infer that manipulation of thiol oxidation state can interconvert kinetic variants of AOX.Redox effects on XDH are well known. Conversion between the NAD+ dependent, D-form, and the oxygen dependent, O-form, is a redox-dependent process reversible by chemical reduction (7Nishino T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 39Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 40Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, redox effects on XDH have dramatic effects on the kinetic parameters of the enzyme (41Saito T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10015-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AOX does not have an NAD+-dependent form of the enzyme, and therefore conversion between D-form and O-form is irrelevant. While cysteine residues critical for D-form to O-form conversion in XDH were not conserved in AOX (42Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29859-29864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), most of the 41 cysteine residues found in rat liver AOX are conserved with vertebrate XDHs. These cysteine residues would be expected to take part in the same biochemical reactivities as those found in XDH. Since we observed that redox effects on K m(app) were preserved from crude extracts through post-benzamidine-purified enzyme and that these effects alone were sufficient to explain the differences between male and female variants, we infer that the differentK m(app) variants result not from expression of alternative genes but from redox effects that may act either on AOX itself or on a closely associated protein capable of modulating K m(app) for AOX.Our observations can be explained by the activity of the hepatic microsomal monooxygenase. The cystamylating flavin monooxygenase catalyzes oxidation of cysteamine, a thiol, to cystamine, a disulfide, and this reaction provides a significant source of disulfide responsible for maintaining the intracellular thiol:disulfide potential (43Ziegler D.M. Duffel M.W. Poulsen L.L. Ciba Found. Symp. 1980; 72: 191-204Google Scholar, 44Tynes R.E. Hodgson E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The thiol:disulfide potential is thought to reflect two ratios: the GSH:GSSG ratio and the cysteamine:cystamine ratio. Protein oxidation state depends on overall thiol:disulfide potential. Higher levels of monooxygenase lead to a more oxidizing environment, while reduced monooxygenase levels result in a more reducing environment. Significantly, monooxygenase from mice or rats is regulated by testosterone in precisely the fashion that kinetic variants of AOX are regulated (43Ziegler D.M. Duffel M.W. Poulsen L.L. Ciba Found. Symp. 1980; 72: 191-204Google Scholar). Male rat hepatic monooxygenase levels are lower than female levels. Castration of male rats elevates monooxygenase and leads to elevated cystamine and a more oxidizing cytosol. Testosterone reverses this effect and restores the reducing environment. Furthermore, testosterone treatment of females lowers monooxygenase and elevates cysteamine levels. These observations may explain both the effect of testosterone and the ability to purify kinetically distinct forms of AOX from male and female rats since neither thioltransferase nor glutathione reductase, the two other enzymes establishing thiol:disulfide potential, are regulated by testosterone (43Ziegler D.M. Duffel M.W. Poulsen L.L. Ciba Found. Symp. 1980; 72: 191-204Google Scholar). We posit that AOX is sensitive to the thiol:disulfide potential and that kinetic variants of AOX reflect the intracellular thiol:disulfide potential through thiol modification of AOX. Activity of the monooxygenase could thereby regulate AOX K m(app) by “setting” the thiol:disulfide potential leading to a more oxidized form of AOX in the female or a more reduced form of AOX in the male. This may have direct consequences for ROS generation from AOX since the kinetically less efficient enzyme may bias ROS generation for superoxide anion. This argument does not require expression of a second AOX gene and can account for the failure of testosterone to regulate AOX gene expression in rats despite finding kinetically distinct forms in males and females. AOX thiol modification could also explain both novel electrophoretic variants (9Holmes R.S. Biochem. Genet. 1979; 17: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the widely variant kinetic characteristics of AOX from different organs and different species (16Beedham C. Bruce S.E.

The A6 cell line was used as a model epithelia to investigate regulation of aldosterone-induced Na+ transport byS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHHase), the only enzyme in vertebrates known to catabolizeS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), an end product inhibitor of methyl esterification. Sodium reabsorption was decreased within 2 h by 3-deazaadenosine, a competitive inhibitor of SAHHase, with a half inhibitory concentration between 40 and 50 μm. Aldosterone increased SAH catabolism by activating SAHHase. Increased SAH catabolism was associated with a concomitant increase in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism. Moreover, SAH decreased substrate methylation. Antisense oligonucleotide complementary to SAHHase mRNA decreased SAHHase activity and Na+ current by approximately 50%. Overexpression of SAHHase increased SAHHase activity and dependent substrate methyl esterification. Whereas basal Na+ current was not affected by overexpression of SAHHase, aldosterone-induced current in SAHHase-overexpressing cells was significantly potentiated. These results demonstrate that aldosterone induction of SAHHase activity is necessary for a concomitant relief of the methylation reaction from end product inhibition by SAH and the subsequent increase in Na+ reabsorption. Thus, regulation of SAHHase activity is a control point for aldosterone signal transduction, but SAHHase is not an aldosterone-induced protein. Aldosterone-induced Na+reabsorption, in part, is regulated by a critical methyl esterification; however, the signal transduction pathway regulating this methylation remains unclear.

Endocrine regulation of NaCl and water reabsorption at the collecting tubule of the kidney is the major site in vertebrates for maintaining normal blood pressure. Aldosterone is the primary hormone modulating salt reabsorption across renal epithelial tissue. Aldosterone increases cell entry of Na+ from the urine across the apical plasma membrane by regulating the activity of the 4 pS, amiloride-sensitive, Na+-selective channel (ENaC 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; βENaC, β subunit (one of three) of the heteromultimeric ENaC; SAHHase, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase; SAH, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; DZA, 3-deazaadenosine; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; AFC, N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; βENaC, β subunit (one of three) of the heteromultimeric ENaC; SAHHase, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase; SAH, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; DZA, 3-deazaadenosine; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; AFC, N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.; see Refs. 1Garty H.

Similar to other steroids, aldosterone regulates cell activity by modifying gene expression. Whereas the end result of aldosterone action, increased Na+ reabsorption, is well known, the aldosterone-induced proteins and resulting signal transduction pathways remain poorly described and controversial. Provocative studies by Sariban-Sohraby and colleagues (4Sariban-Sohraby S. Burg M. Wiesmann W.P. Chiang P.K. Johnson J.P. Science. 1984; 225: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and Wiesmannet al. (5Wiesmann W.P. Johnson J.P. Miura G.A. Chaing P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F43-F47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) established a correlation between methyl esterification and acute, aldosterone-induced Na+transport. Several subsequent studies support further the hypothesis that a critical protein methyl esterification, in part, signals the acute actions of aldosterone (3Eaton D.C. Becchetti A. Ma H. Ling B.N. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 941-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Blazer-Yost B.L. Hughes C.L. Nolan P.L. Am. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26613-26617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate of this critical methylation remains controversial and is an active area of research. Results from our laboratory suggest that aldosterone increases methyl esterification of p21ras in renal epithelial cells (9Al-Baldawi N.F. Stockand J.D. Eaton D.C. FASEB J. 1998; 21 (abstr.): 2447Google Scholar). A study by Rokaw et al. (10Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shyonsky V. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28746-28751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) provides evidence that βENaC also may be an important substrate of aldosterone-induced methylation. Although methylation is a component of aldosterone regulation of Na+transport, the signal transduction controlling this covalent modification remains to be described. The enzymes directly regulating substrate methylation are methyltransferase and methylesterase catalyzing methyl esterification and methyl ester hydrolysis, respectively. Protein methylation is analogous to protein phosphorylation both being molecular switches controlling protein activity/locale in a reversible manner. The predominant, intracellular methyl-donating molecule is S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet). Methyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of a methyl moiety from AdoMet onto a substrate with the end product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) being formed. This end product is a potent feedback inhibitor of most transmethylation reactions involving AdoMet as the methyl donor (11Ueland P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1982; 34: 223-253PubMed Google Scholar). The observation by Sariban-Sohraby et al. (4Sariban-Sohraby S. Burg M. Wiesmann W.P. Chiang P.K. Johnson J.P. Science. 1984; 225: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that aldosterone increases methylation of both protein and lipid is consistent with the notion that a general regulator of transmethylation reactions is the control point for mineralocorticoid-induced methylation. Thus, regulation of cellular SAH concentration may be an important site for controlling methylation relevant to aldosterone signal transduction. The only enzyme known to hydrolyze SAH in vertebrates isS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHHase; EC3.3.1.1; see Ref. 11Ueland P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1982; 34: 223-253PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme reversibly metabolizes SAH with hydrolysis resulting in production of adenosine andl-homocysteine. The cDNA encoding SAHHase has been identified in various species including Xenopus laevis(12Seery L.T. McCabe B.D. Schoenber D.R. Whitehead A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Pharmacological and molecular inhibitors of SAHHase and overexpression of SAHHase were used to test directly the notion that SAHHase activity regulates Na+ reabsorption. Since cellular SAH levels as set by hydrolase activity may regulate Na+ transport through modulation of substrate methyl esterification, the hypothesis that aldosterone increases SAHHase activity with concomitant increases in methylation also was tested. The results of the current study demonstrate that the natriferic actions of aldosterone are dependent on SAHHase activity with aldosterone-induced SAH hydrolysis promoting substrate methyl esterification and subsequent induction of Na+ reabsorption. Regulation of SAHHase activity by aldosterone was shown to be one control site for mineralocorticoid-induced methylation and Na+reabsorption. Amphibian distal tubule principal cells (A6 cells; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in 4% CO2 at 26 °C in a mixture of Coon's F-12 (3 parts) and Leibovitz's L-15 (7 parts) media (Irving Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 104 mm NaCl, 0.6% penicillin, 1.0% streptomycin, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 25 mmNaHCO3, and 1.5 μm aldosterone (complete media). Basic media were without aldosterone and fetal bovine serum. Single-stranded cDNA from A6 cells was created using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and poly(A)+ mRNA harvested with the FastTrack 2.0 Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). An X. laevis SAHHase full-length clone was amplified from this cDNA using a polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with specific primers developed from the reported X. laevis SAHHase sequence (see Ref. 12Seery L.T. McCabe B.D. Schoenber D.R. Whitehead A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number L35559) as follows: forward primer, 5′-TTCACCATGTCTGACAAACTGTCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGGAGGAAGATTGGTAAAAGAAAGC-3′. Subsequent to agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2%; TAE) to separate polymerase chain reaction products, a 1.8-kilobase pair fragment consistent with xSAHHase was isolated and ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The insert then was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−) (Invitrogen) usingNotI. Nucleotide sequence data from this new expression plasmid (pxSAHHase3.1(−)zeo) was homologous to that reported by Seeryet al. (12Seery L.T. McCabe B.D. Schoenber D.R. Whitehead A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and was consistent with the plasmid containing the full-length clone for xSAHHase. As shown in Fig.1, in vitro translation of pxSAHHase3.1(−)zeo using the TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) produced a protein of appropriate size (∼48 kDa) for a complete open reading frame. LipofectAMINE PLUS reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used for transfection of A6 and HEK293 cells. Transfection followed closely the standard protocol for these reagents only differing in the fact that for A6 cells incubation time was increased to 18 h. Transient transfected HEK293 cells were maintained in tissue culture using standard techniques and used for experimentation 2–3 days post-transfection. In contrast, A6 cell transfection was prolonged by zeocin (400 μg/ml) selection. Subpassages (up to four passages after transfection) of the extended transfected A6 cells were used for experimentation. Control transfectants contained either pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−) vector or pVgRXR (Invitrogen). Neither of these plasmids affected cell activity. Antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GGACAGTTTGTCAGACATGGTG-3′) was complementary to and spanned the translation start codon (−4 to 18) of xSAHHase mRNA, whereas sense oligonucleotide (5′-CACCATGTCTGACAAACTGTCC-3′) was homologous to the coding sequence of the same region. In X. laevis, the only sequence with identity to these oligonucleotides as described by a blastn (National Center for Biotechnology Information) search was SAHHase. Addition of exogenous single-stranded oligonucleotides to A6 cells followed a protocol similar to that previously described by this laboratory (13Ling B.N. Zuckerman J.B. Lin C. Harte B.J. McNulty K.A. Smith P.R. Gomez L.M. Worrell R.T. Eaton D.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 594-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, competent A6 cell monolayers washed with phosphate-buffered saline were treated for 24 h prior to experimentation with 5–10 μmoligonucleotide dissolved in basic media. Aldosterone then was repleted for 4 h in the presence of oligonucleotide. For Northern blot analysis, 3–5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from A6 cells was separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and probed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides of interest. Probes were produced by nick translation and incorporation of [32P]dCTP. Northern blots were hybridized and washed under high stringency conditions and then imaged on a PhosphorImager after 1–24 h exposure. Band density was quantified using SigmaGel software (Jandel Scientific). A continuous spectrophotometric, enzyme-coupled assay similar to that reported by Palmer and Abeles (14Palmer J.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Hershfield et al. (15Hershfield M.S. Aiyar V.N. Premakumar R. Small W.C. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was used to quantify SAHHase activity. In brief, whole cell lysate was collected by Dounce homogenizing cells washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline in 1 ml/106 cells of lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0). Cellular debris were precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant maintained at 4 °C was used as the source of SAHHase with enzyme activity being assayed within 2 h after centrifugation. With the addition of exogenous adenosine deaminase (EC3.5.4.4), SAHHase activity in whole cell lysate becomes rate-limiting for the metabolism of SAH to inosine. Enzyme activity was measured in the hydrolytic direction in the following reaction buffer: (in mm) 25 KPO4, 2 MgCl2, 1 EDTA, pH 7.2. The final reaction volume was 1 ml with 698 μl of reaction buffer, 100 μl of 1 mm SAH, 200 μl of A6 whole cell lysate, and 2 μl of adenosine deaminase (∼5 units; Sigma, type VIII). The reaction was initiated after addition of lysate, and absorbance changes at λ265 resulting from SAH metabolism to inosine were recorded using an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The initial rate of absorbance change (1–5 min) was used to establish activity. Transmethylation was quantified by alkaline hydrolysis of methyl esters in a vapor phase assay similar to that described by Clarke et al. (16Clarke S. Vogel J.P. Deschenes R.J. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4643-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In brief,N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine (AFC) was used as a methyl acceptor, AdoMet as a methyl donor, and A6 whole cell lysate as the source of methyltransferase. Subsequent to washing 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were extracted at 4 °C by Dounce homogenization (1 ml/106 cells) in 50 mm Tris-HCl plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0. Cellular debris were precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Methylation of AFC was assayed in 50 μl of lysate supplemented with 720 nm [methyl-3H]AdoMet (77 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 100 μm AFC. After incubation for 1 h, the reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 60% trichloroacetic acid. Methylated substrate was isolated by organic extraction in 400 μl of heptane. The organic phase was subsequently dried and subjected to base hydrolysis (1 m NaOH). Under these conditions, only methyl esters (e.g. methylated AFC) are hydrolyzed. Liberated radioactivity was assayed with a Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzer (model 1900CA; Packard Instrument Co.). The methyl donor (AdoMet) and end product (SAH) concentrations were quantified using standard paper chromatography. Confluent monolayers of A6 cells were maintained in methionine-free, basic media for 48 h. One day prior to experimentation, cell media were supplemented with tracer amounts (50 μm) of [35S]methionine (1157 Ci/mmol; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Irvine, CA). Aldosterone (1.5 μm) was repleted for 4 h and cells collected in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer as above. Metabolites were separated by paper chromatography on Whatman 3MM paper. To locate radiolabeled AdoMet and SAH, 5 μl of a mixture of 1 mm non-labeled methionine, homocysteine, cysteine, AdoMet, and SAH was run in parallel with each sample. Metabolite location was identified upon development using ninhydrin reagent plus heat. Two solvents were used in series to separate metabolites as follows: 1) n-butyl alcohol/glacial acetic acid/water (65:150:20, v/v), and 2) isopropyl alcohol/ammonia/water (70:10:20, v/v). Subsequent to localization of metabolites, corresponding spots were removed from the paper, and radioactivity was quantified using the Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzer. For assessment of transepithelial potentials (PD) and resistances (R), A6 cells were plated on permeable, 25-mm tissue culture inserts (0.02 μm Anopore membrane; Nalge NUNC International, Naperville, IL) and grown to confluency (approximately 10 days) in the presence of complete media. Monolayer competency was determined by resistance measurement (≥1.0 kiloohm/cm2). Prior to experimentation, competent monolayers were treated with basic media for 48 h. to decrease Na+ transport to a basal, non-steroid-induced state. This enabled the dissociation of the acute from chronic actions of aldosterone. Monolayers then were repleted with aldosterone (1.5 μm) with or without experimental agents for 4 h. Transepithelial PD and R before and after treatment were measured using a Millicell Electrical Resistance System with dual Ag/AgCl pellet electrodes (Millipore Corp.). Equivalent short circuit current (eqIsc) was calculated using Ohm's law: PD = eqIsc × R. Aldosterone-induced current in this system was amiloride-sensitive and carried by Na+. All reagents were purchased from Sigma or Calbiochem unless indicated otherwise. Sense and antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Emory University Microchemical Facility. This facility also synthesized the specific X. laevis SAHHase primers used for polymerase chain reaction. For each lysate, protein concentration was established using the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test for paired and unpaired data as appropriate. For multiple comparison, a one-way analysis of variance in conjunction with the Student-Newman-Keuls test was used. A p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Shown in Fig. 2are the time course and dose-response profiles of the actions of DZA (4-amino-1-[β-d-ribofuranosyl]-1H-imidazo[4,5]-pyridine) on steady state Na+ transport in A6 cells maintained in complete media. Maximum current inhibition occurred within 2 h after application. At 2 h, relative currents were 0.64 ± 0.07, 0.44 ± 0.17, 0.31 ± 0.01, 0.18 ± 0.22, and 0.04 ± 0.02 and were significantly different than currents at time 0 h for all doses of DZA (30, 50, 100, and 300 μm, respectively; n = 6) and amiloride. In contrast, relative current at 2 h across monolayers treated with vehicle (0.95 ± 0.09) was not different compared with 0 h. Moreover, all relative currents at 2 h were different compared with vehicle at 2 h. The half inhibitory concentration for DZA was between 40 and 50 μm. Interestingly, current inhibition by DZA at concentrations <100 μm lasted only 4 h, after which (≥6 h) current tended toward levels prior to addition. Relative current at 8 h for the 30 μm group was significantly greater than cells treated with vehicle. The effects of SAHHase inhibition on aldosterone-induced current and cellular concentrations of AdoMet and SAH are shown in Fig.3. The changes in current induced by aldosterone in the absence and presence of DZA are shown in Fig.3 A and summarized in Table I. Addition of aldosterone (1.5 μm) for 4 h to monolayers serum and steroid deprived for 48 h significantly increased eqIsc by 1.84 ± 0.11 μA/cm2 (n = 16). In the presence of 50, 100., and 300 μm DZA, aldosterone significantly increased current (ΔeqIsc = 1.05 ± 0.06, 0.82 ± 0.13 and 0.67 ± 0.13, respectively) compared with base line; however, induced current in the presence of DZA (at all doses) was significantly lower compared with that in the absence of DZA.Table IRegulation of eqIsc by aldosterone in knock-out and overexpressing A6 cellsGroup observationsaA6 cells washed with basic media, repleted with aldosterone alone, or in addition to 3-deazaadenosine (0.1 mm), sense DNA, antisense DNA, or repletion of cells transfected with control plasmid or pxSAHHase3.1(−)zeo, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 B shows the percent change in AdoMet and SAH levels in A6 cells in response to aldosterone in the absence and presence of the SAHHase inhibitor, DZA. AdoMet levels significantly decreased by 15.6 ± 1.7% (n = 6) in response to aldosterone. Similarly, aldosterone significantly decreased SAH levels by 5.8 ± 1.5% (n = 6). In the presence of DZA (300 μm), aldosterone-induced AdoMet catabolism was significantly attenuated with levels being only 2.5 ± 0.5% (n = 6) lower than the concentration prior to steroid addition. Upon simultaneous addition of DZA with aldosterone, SAH level significantly increased 14.6 ± 0.1% (n = 6), which is significantly greater compared with that in the absence of inhibitor. These observations demonstrate that inhibition of SAHHase activity decreases SAH metabolism resulting in a concomitant decrease in AdoMet metabolism. Regulation of methyltransferase activity in A6 cells by end product inhibition was confirmed. Transmethylation of pseudosubstrate (AFC) in response to enzymes contained in whole cell lysate was significantly inhibited by SAH (100 μm) from a control of 43.46 ± 4.80 cpm/μg to 20.04 ± 0.34 cpm/μg (n = 3; data not shown in a figure). Fig. 4 shows that aldosterone increases SAHHase activity in cell lysate but does not increase significantly xSAHHase mRNA levels. Active SAHHase was inhibited by DZA. As shown in Fig. 4 A (and summarized in TableII), application of aldosterone for 4 h to serum- and steroid-starved cells significantly increased SAHHase activity from 1.19 ± 0.19 (n = 5) to 2.38 ± 0.26 (n = 8) nm/min/mg. However, aldosterone-induced SAHHase activity was significantly attenuated to 0.39 ± 0.10 (n = 8) upon addition of DZA (10 μm) to cell lysate during enzyme assays. Northern analysis in Fig. 4, B and C, shows that mRNA identified by a radiolabeled xSAHHase probe does not increase in response to aldosterone. In such experiments (representative blot shown in Fig. 4 B and 5 experiments summarized in Fig.4 C), the ratio of xSAHHase to GAPDH mRNA did not significantly change in response to aldosterone application for 4 h with the steroid-depleted and repleted ratios being 1.04 ± 0.30 (n = 3) and 1.58 ± 0.34 (n = 5), respectively.Table IIRegulation of SAHHase activity by aldosterone in knock-out and overexpressing cellsGroup observationsDepletedRepleted, 4 hControl, n = 5, 81.19 ± 0.192.38 ± 0.26ap < 0.05 versus depleted.DZA, n = 80.39 ± 0.10bp < 0.05 versus repleted control and repleted pControl.Sense, n = 72.76 ± 0.42Antisense, n = 71.26 ± 0.21cp < 0.05 versus repleted sense.pControl, n = 5, 81.51 ± 0.362.82 ± 0.50dp = 0.088 versus depleted.pxSAHHase3.1(−)zeo, n = 5, 82.36 ± 0.37ep < 0.05 versus depleted control.4.91 ± 0.66ap < 0.05 versus depleted.,bp < 0.05 versus repleted control and repleted pControl.All values are mean ± S.E. nm/min/mg.

Application of oligonucleotides complementary to the region of the xSAHHase sequence around the translation start site reduced SAHHase activity and aldosterone-induced Na+transport (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 A(and summarized in Table II) shows that the SAHHase activity in cells treated with aldosterone for 4 h and sense oligonucleotide overnight (2.76 ± 0.42 nm/min/mg; n = 7) was not significantly different from the SAHHase activity in cells treated with steroid alone (2.38 ± 0.26 nm/min/mg;n = 8; Fig. 4 A). However, the SAHHase activity in cells that were treated with aldosterone for 4 h and antisense oligonucleotides overnight (1.26 ± 0.21 nm/min/mg; n = 7) was significantly lower than cells treated with aldosterone and sense oligonucleotides or cells treated with steroid alone. Aldosterone-induced current also was inhibited by antisense but not sense oligonucleotides (Fig. 5 B and Table I). In sense-treated cells, aldosterone significantly increasedeqIsc by 1.6 ± 0.10 μA/cm2(n = 63), an increase similar to the response of cells treated with steroid alone. In contrast to sense-treated cells, pretreatment with antisense oligonucleotides significantly decreased aldosterone-induced current by approximately 50% to 0.82 ± 0.10 μA/cm2 (n = 107). Note that simply washing steroid and serum-starved cells with basic media failed to significantly change current (n = 18). Overexpression of SAHHase in HEK293 cells increased hydrolase activity and AFC methylation (Fig.6). Fig. 6 A shows that the hydrolase activity in pxSAHHase3.1(−)zeo-transfected HEK293 cells of 1.66 ± 0.27 nm/min/mg (n = 6) is significantly greater than the 0.90 ± 0.16 nm/mg/min (n = 6) observed in control-transfected cells. Moreover, the methylation of AFC, depicted in Fig. 6 B, of 71.4 ± 11.7 cpm/μg × 10−2 (n = 7) in lysate from pxSAHHase3.1(−)zeo-transfected HEK293 cells is significantly greater compared with the 39.6 ± 8.3 (n = 9) cpm/μg/min × 10−2 in control transfectants. Transfection with pxSAHHase3.1(−)zeo of A6 cells, shown in Fig.7, increased both xSAHHase mRNA level and SAHHase activity. As shown in the representative Northern blot (Fig. 7 A), A6 cells transfected with pxSAHHase3.1(−)zeo had more xSAHHase mRNA compared with control transfectants. Four such experiments are summarized in Fig. 7 B. The ratio of relative band densities for xSAHHase to GAPDH is significantly increased 2.65-fold in pxSAHHase3.1(−)zeo versus control (relative density of xSAHHase/GAPDH = 1) transfectants. Fig. 7 C(summarized in Table II) demonstrates that similar to message level, SAHHase activity in the absence of aldosterone and serum is increased in A6 cells transfected with pxSAHHase3.1(−)zeo (2.36 ± 0.37 nm/min/mg; n = 5). Aldosterone addition significantly increased activity in pxSAHHase3.1(−)zeo transfectants to 4.91 ± 0.66 nm/min/mg (n = 8). The activity in response to aldosterone for SAHHase-overexpressing cells was significantly greater compared with that for control transfectants (2.82 ± 0.50 nm/min/mg; n = 8).

The selection utilizes pol β's ability to substitute for Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (pol I) in the SC18-12 strain, which lacks active pol I. pol β allows SC18-12 cells to grow, but they depend on pol β activity, so inhibition of pol β by AZT kills them. We screened a library of randomly mutated pol β cDNA for complementation of the pol I defect in the presence of AZT, and identified AZT-resistant mutants. We purified two enzymes with nonconservative mutations in the palm domain of the polymerase. The substitutions D246V and R253M result in reductions in the steady-state catalytic efficiency (K cat/K m) of AZT-TP incorporation. The efficiency of dTTP incorporation was unchanged for the D246V enzyme, indicating that the substantial decrease in AZT-TP incorporation is responsible for its drug resistance. The R253M enzyme exhibits significantly higher K m(dTTP) andK cat(dTTP) values, implying that the incorporation reaction is altered. These are the first pol β mutants demonstrated to exhibit AZT resistance in vitro. The locations of the Asp-246 and Arg-253 side chains indicate that substrate specificity is influenced by residues distant from the nucleotide-binding pocket.

Efficient and accurate synthesis of DNA, during replication and repair, is essential to the integrity of any genome. Template-directed synthesis requires that a polymerase select the appropriate deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) and exclude incorrect bases. The interaction between a polymerase and substrates must therefore be highly specific, yet flexible, in order to maintain sequence fidelity. The smallest of the eukaryotic enzymes that accomplish this reaction is DNA polymerase β (pol β), 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; AZT-TP, 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine triphosphate; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; NA, nutrient agar; NB, nutrient broth. a mammalian polymerase which fills short gaps in DNA (1Singhal R.K.

Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 6Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis by pol β can be compromised by the nucleoside analog drug AZT, which closely resembles a normal substrate. AZT-triphosphate (AZT-TP) presents a normal thymine moiety which may form a Watson-Crick base pair with adenosine, but has a modified sugar ring that results in chain termination. pol β incorporates AZT into DNA in vitro (7Copeland W.C. Chen M.S. Wang T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21459-21464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implying that pol β is not able to distinguish perfectly between the drug and the natural nucleotide substrate. This susceptibility of pol β makes AZT resistance a useful probe of enzyme-substrate interactions involved in DNA synthesis. The molecular basis for polymerase substrate specificity, and specifically AZT discrimination, is not well understood. The clinical problem of AZT-resistant HIV has been attributed to mutations in HIV reverse transcriptase. However, the mutant reverse transcriptase enzymes have exhibited little or no change in AZT-TP incorporationin vitro, despite their ability to confer AZT resistancein vivo.(8Lacey S.F. Reardon J.E. Furfine E.S. Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Eckert K.A. Kemp S.D. Larder B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15789-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) The absence of an apparent in vitrophenotype makes these enzymes troublesome subjects for mechanistic studies of substrate specificity. In order to investigate substrate specificity and drug resistance in pol β, we have developed a system for the identification of AZT-resistant forms of pol β, using in vivocomplementation of polymerase-deficient Escherichia coli.The recA718polA12 E. coli strain carries a temperature-sensitive mutation in the pol Agene, rendering DNA polymerase I (pol I) inactive above 37 °C (9Witkin E.M. Roegner-Maniscalco V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4166-4168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of rat pol β in these cells restores their ability to conduct DNA replication and repair at a nonpermissive temperature, indicating that pol β is able to substitute for E. colipol I (10Sweasy J.B. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because growth of these cells at a nonpermissive temperature depends on the activity of pol β, any inhibitor of pol β is lethal to the cells. At 37 °C in the presence of drug, cells expressing drug-sensitive pol β will die, while the cells expressing drug-resistant mutants will survive. The survival of a cell in the presence of AZT depends on the ability of pol β to distinguish between deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and very similar molecules. This creates selective pressure for mutant polymerases with strict substrate specificity. In vivo selection is a powerful strategy for the identification of drug-resistant mutants. The ability to screen large numbers of clones makes it possible to seek drug resistance mutations among a library of randomly mutated clones. We report here a selection for AZT resistance mutations in pol β. We show that AZT can prevent wild type pol β from complementing the pol I defect, allowing selection for drug-resistant mutants. We have exploited this system to select clones expressing drug-resistant pol β variants. We have identified AZT-resistant mutants carrying single amino acid changes in locations distributed around the enzyme. We describe two mutant enzymes identified by this selection which carry nonconservative substitutions in the palm domain causing dramatic increases in AZT resistance in vivo. The drug resistance of these mutant enzymes correlates with a drop in the steady state turnover number for AZT-TP incorporation relative to dTTP incorporation. Both enzymes carry a single amino acid substitution that is not near the active site or nucleotide binding pocket, suggesting that substrate specificity is influenced by residues distant from the active site. The strain used for isolating AZT-resistant mutants is known as SC18-12 and has the genotyperecA718 polA12 uvrA155 trpE65 lon-11 sul A1 (11Witkin E.M. McCall J.O. Volkert M.R. Wermundsen I.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 185: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The strain BL21 DE3 was used for protein expression and has genotype F− ompT hsdSB(rB-mB−) gal dcm (DE3). Nutrient agar (NA) was Difco nutrient agar with 5 g/liter NaCl. Nutrient Broth (NB) and LB broth were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions (Difco). The ability of SC18-12 cells expressing WT pol β to survive a range of AZT concentrations was measured in order to identify an AZT concentration which would kill the cells when they depend on pol β but not when pol I is active. SC18-12 cells were transformed by electroporation with the IPTG-inducible expression vector pβ2, a derivative of pHSG576 (12Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) containing the pol β cDNA. Transformants were allowed to recover at 30 °C for 2 h. Transformation efficiency was determined by plating serially diluted cells on NA 30 °C. Cells were kept overnight at 4 °C (to allow transformation efficiency plates to grow and be counted) then plated at approximately 400 colony forming units/plate on NA with chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) and tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml), 1 mm IPTG, and varying concentrations of AZT (Sigma). Duplicate plates were incubated at 30 and 37 °C. The number of colonies formed on each drug concentration was divided by the number formed in the absence of drug to give the surviving fraction. In order to generate a pool of mutant pol β enzymes, the rat pol β cDNA was amplified, with primers designed to anneal immediately upstream and downstream of the gene, under mutagenic polymerase chain reaction conditions expected to produce mostly single base changes (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm dNTPs, 30 pmol of each primer, 5 units of Taq polymerase cycle parameters: 1 min, 94 °C; 2 min, 55 °C; 3 min, 72 °C for 30 cycles) (13Zhou Y.H. Zhang X.P. Ebright R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The mutated polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the pβ2 vector. Drug-resistant mutants were selected out of the pool of random mutations on the basis of their ability to grow in the presence of AZT. SC18-12 cells were transformed by electroporation with the mutated pol β cDNA library. Transformants were allowed to recover at 30 °C for 2 h. Transformation efficiency was determined on NA at 30 °C. Cells were diluted in saline and plated at approximately 400 colony forming units/plate on NA with antibiotics, IPTG, and 600 nm AZT (Sigma), and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. Three equivalent plates were incubated at 30 °C (permissive temperature) to determine the total number of colony forming units screened. The surviving colonies were isolated on NA with antibiotics. The pβ2 plasmid was isolated from each of these strains and sequenced to identify mutations in the pol β cDNA. In order to confirm that AZT resistance was due to the pβ2 plasmid, rather than a cellular mutation, mutant plasmids were electroporated back into SC18-12 cells and assayed for the ability to grow in the presence of AZT. Strains expressing wild type or mutant pol β were grown overnight at 30 °C in NB without shaking and streaked radially onto rich medium with antibiotics, 1 mm IPTG, and 600 nm AZT where indicated. Plates were incubated for 2 days at 37 °C. SC18-12 cells expressing WT pol β were not able to grow enough to form rotary streaks in these conditions, so those mutants that did form streaks were considered AZT resistant. The AZT resistance phenotype of the confirmed mutants was quantified by plating on increasing concentrations of AZT. Plasmids identified as carrying drug resistance mutations within the pol β cDNA were electrotransformed into SC18-12 cells. Single colonies were grown overnight in NB at 30 °C, diluted in saline, and plated on NA with antibiotics, IPTG, and varying concentrations of AZT. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. The number of colonies formed on each drug concentration was divided by the number formed in the absence of drug to give the surviving fraction. The portion of the each mutant pol β cDNA containing the mutation was subcloned into the pHis-β vector, which expresses pol β as a fusion protein with a His tag at the N terminus. The enzymes were purified using Ni2+-charged His-bind resin from Novagen or Ni-NTA resin from Qiagen according to the manufacturers instructions. The proteins were expressed in BL21 DE3 cells, which were grown to OD600 = 0.5 and then induced overnight at room temperature with 1 mm IPTG. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pepstatin, chymostatin, and antipain (0.1 mg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 mg/ml), and aprotitin (1 mg/ml), and lysed by sonication. Extracts were cleared by ultracentrifugation, and then loaded onto a column containing approximately 1 ml of Ni2+charged resin/100 ml of starting culture. The column was washed with 60 mm imidazole and protein was eluted with 1 mimidazole in 0.5 m NaCl. Protein was concentrated if necessary in a Centricon 30 and stored at −80 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mmNaCl, 15% glycerol, and protease inhibitors as above. We estimate the preparation to be at least 90% homogenous (data not shown). In steady-state kinetic assays measuring incorporation of dNTPs (see below) the His-tagged pol β enzyme and the wild type (untagged) have identical kinetic constants K m(dNTP),K cat, and K m(DNA) when compared side by side in incorporation assays (data not shown). Therefore, we employed the His-tagged enzyme in biochemical assays. The activity of each enzyme was measured by incorporation of [α-32P]dATP into activated calf thymus DNA. Reaction conditions were 50 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μm dithiothreitol, 50 μm dNTPs, and 1 mm DNA. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then stopped with EDTA. Reactions were spotted onto GFA filters, which were washed twice in 22.5 mg/ml NaPPi, 8.5% concentrated perchloric acid, twice in 22.5 mg/ml NaPPi, 8% concentrated hydrochloric acid, and then once in 95% EtOH. Filters were dried and counted in a scintillation counter. The ability of each enzyme to incorporate dTTP and AZT-TP into a primer template was tested using annealed 16-mer and 45-mer of the following sequence: 5′-AACCAAGAGCATACGA and ATGTTGGTTCTCGTATGCTACCAATCGCAACTTGGATATAACAAC-5′. The site of incorporation is underlined. This sequence was chosen because pol β had previously been demonstrated to incorporate AZT-TP into this primer template (14Bouayadi K. Hoffmann J.S. Fons P. Tiraby M. Reynes J.P. Cazaux C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 110-116PubMed Google Scholar). The oligos were synthesized at the Yale Department of Pathology facility. The primer oligo was gel purified by standard methods. Both oligos were radiolabeled at the 5′ end by standard methods using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The oligos were annealed at a primer:template molar ratio of 1:1.2 in 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mmMgCl2. Complete annealing of primer was confirmed on a 20% acrylamide native minigel. Reactions were conducted at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5% glycerol, and 200 nm32P-end-labeled primer-template. The reactions were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 min, started by the addition of substrate, incubated for the indicated reaction time, and stopped by the addition of 0.5 mEDTA. Samples were analyzed on a 20% Sequel NE (American Bioanalytical) gel. Bands were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis to measure product formation as a function of time. The kinetic constantsK m and K cat were derived by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to plots of the results (velocityversus substrate concentration) using Sigmaplot curve-fitting software. The results of three independent determinations were averaged. The dissociation constantK D (DNA) was measured using a gel mobility shift assay (15Minnick D.T. Astatke M. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24954-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Casas-Finet J.R. Kumar A. Karpel R.L. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10272-10280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 16-mer and 45-mer oligos were prepared and annealed as described above. Fifteen protein concentrations ranging from 4 μm to 0.25 nm, expected to bracket theK D, were incubated with O.1 nm DNA in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 6 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After a 10-min incubation at 20 °C, samples were loaded onto a 6% acrylamide nondenaturing gel with the current running at 300 V. After loading, voltage was reduced to 150 V, and the gel was run for 1 h. Fractions bound were determined by PhosphorImage quantitation of the gel. The dissociation constantK D was derived from Sigmaplot fitting of the fraction bound versus protein concentration with the equation: Y = [(m 1 *x)/(x + K D)] +m 3, where m 1 is a scaling factor and m 3 is the apparent minimumY value (15Minnick D.T. Astatke M. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24954-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). WT rat pol β is capable of substituting for the E. coli enzyme DNA polymerase I in recA718polA12 cells, restoring the cells' ability to grow on rich medium at 37 °C (10Sweasy J.B. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether AZT would interfere with functional complementation of the polymerase defect of recA718polA12 cells by pol β. A representative rotary streak assay is shown in Fig.1 A. On the top row are plates grown at 30 °C, a permissive temperature at which pol I is active. The SC18-12 cells grow well at 30 °C with or without expression of WT pol β. The addition of 600 nm AZT to the medium (upper right) resulted in streaks that were somewhat sparse and translucent in appearance, but did not prevent the streak from growing out to the edge of the plate, where the cells are least dense. At 37 °C (bottom row, Fig. 1 A), SC18-12 cells are unable to form a rotary streak unless they express WT pol β. In the presence of AZT (bottom right), SC18-12 cells expressing WT pol β were unable to form a streak, demonstrating that pol β was unable to complement the growth defect of SC18-12 cells in the presence of AZT. These results indicate that AZT is toxic to the cells when they are dependent on pol β activity. At 30 °C, when pol I is functional, SC18-12 cells are not prevented by AZT from forming a rotary streak (top right), demonstrating that the drug at this concentration is not lethal to the cells when they can rely on bacterial polymerases and do not require pol β. In order to identify the range of AZT concentrations that would affect pol β but not bacterial polymerases, we measured the ability of the cells to grow on increasing concentrations of AZT (Fig. 1 B). The surviving fraction (ratio of colonies formed on a given drug concentration to colonies formed in the absence of drug) drops off sharply at 400–500 nm AZT. Those colonies that do form in the presence of AZT (at all concentrations measured) are usually smaller than normal, and appear translucent rather than opaque white, and irregularly shaped rather than round. The presence of 600 nm AZT in the medium is sufficient to kill virtually all pol β dependent growth, without affecting colony formation at 30 °C. Therefore, we conclude that drug-resistant pol β mutants can be identified by selecting for ability to complement therecA718polA12 growth defect in the presence of 600 nm AZT. We selected AZT-resistant mutants from a pool of plasmids carrying the randomly mutated pol β cDNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Of approximately 66,000 mutant colonies screened, 171 grew at 37 °C on nutrient agar containing 600 nm AZT. When the pol β expressing plasmids were rescued from these colonies and sequenced, the majority were found to have more than one mutation, and were put aside. In order to confirm that the AZT-resistant phenotype resulted from expression of mutant pol β, rather than a cellular mutation, we transformed each of the mutant plasmids that carried a single mutation back into SC18-12 cells. Of those that carried only one predicted amino acid substitution, nine were consistently able to confer resistance to AZT onrecA718polA12 cells when re-transformed into these cells. For further characterization, we chose two highly drug-resistant mutants, D246V and R253M. The pol β protein is composed of two domains: the 8-kDa domain, which contains the N terminus of the protein and has deoxyribophosphatase activity (17Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), and the 31-kDa domain, which can perform the incorporation reaction alone. The 31-kDa domain can be further subdivided into fingers, palm, and thumb domains by analogy to the shape of a hand. As in other polymerases, the active site is defined by two Mg2+ ions which participate in the catalytic reaction; these atoms are held in place by three conserved acidic residues (5Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar,18Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 19Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of pol β, the Mg2+ ions are coordinated by the residues Asp-190, Asp-192, and Asp-256, located in the palm domain. We mapped the altered amino acids to the pol β crystal structure (5Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar,6Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar); both carry nonconservative substitutions located in a loop connecting two β strands within the palm domain (Fig.2). Neither residue appears to contact the DNA or incoming nucleotide. Residue Arg-253 is at least 12 Å, and Asp-246 is more than 30 Å, from the active site Mg2+ ions and bound nucleotide. Replacement of the Arg residue at position 253 with Met (using the program Whatif) does not introduce any obvious steric clash with neighboring side chains, but does eliminate a hydrogen bond with Glu-154 and another with the backbone at Asp-226. The side chain of Asp-246 is solvent exposed in this structure. Both Arg-253 and Asp-246 are conserved in the rat, human, andXenopus pol β enzymes (22Reichenberger N.P.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), while most residues in the 240–253 loop are not, which is consistent with the suggestion that these residues have an important role in pol β function. To characterize more fully the AZT resistance phenotype of mutant enzymes, we tested their ability to substitute for pol I in the presence and absence of AZT. The D246V and R253M mutant enzymes were able to complement the growth defect of SC18-12 cells as well as wild type in the absence of drug (data not shown). In the presence of AZT, cells expressing pol β with the mutation D246V or R253M were substantially more drug resistant than cells expressing WT pol β. Fig. 3 A shows typical results of a rotary streak assay of SC18-12 cells expressing WT and mutant pol β. The D246V substitution conferred a moderate improvement in ability to grow on AZT, forming a partial streak. The R253M mutation allowed the cells to form a streak on AZT extending out to the perimeter of the plate. For a quantitative measure of AZT resistance, we determined the surviving fraction of cells expressing WT and mutant pol β when plated on increasing concentrations of AZT. Both pol β R253M and D246V enabled SC18-12 cells to form colonies on AZT just as readily as on no drug, up to the drug concentration that is tolerated by the bacterial polymerases (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the colonies formed by cells expressing pol β R253M appeared round and opaque, and otherwise hearty, unlike the colonies formed by cells depending on pol β WT or D246V, which were irregularly shaped and translucent. To determine whether the D246V and R253M enzymes are resistant to AZT in vitro, we purified the mutant proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that both enzymes were as active as wild type, as measured by their ability to incorporate dNTPs into activated DNA (data not shown). We used a steady-state primer extension assay to ask whether thein vivo drug-resistant phenotypes of the D246V and R253M mutants were due to increased specificity for dTTP over AZT-TP. All three pol β enzymes did extend the primer by one AZT-TP molecule, although the reaction was much slower than dTTP incorporation (Fig.4A). In steady state conditions, the AZT-TP incorporation reaction reaches saturation in about 35 min, while dTTP incorporation saturates after 2 min. We measured the reaction rate (incorporation as a function of time during the linear phase of the reaction, Fig. 4 B) at eight substrate concentrations for each enzyme to determine the steady state constants for AZT-TP and dTTP incorporation by WT and mutant pol β enzymes. Fig. 4 Cshows typical Michaelis-Menten plots from which K mand K cat are derived. The WT pol β enzyme has a 10-fold higher K m and 10-fold lowerK cat value for AZT-TP incorporation as compared with dTTP (Table I). The catalytic efficiency K cat/K m is therefore nearly 2 orders of magnitude lower for AZT-TP incorporation than dTTP. This substantial difference in catalytic efficiency explains why pol β preferentially incorporates dTTP.Table ISteady-state kinetic constants of WT and AZT-resistant pol β enzymespol βAZT-TP incorporationKcat/KmdTTP incorporationKcat/KmKcat(dTTP)KmKcatKmKcatKcat(AZTTP)(μM)(s−1)(μm)s−1WT198 ± 230.065 ± 0.0033.31 × 10−423.6 ± 4.80.75 ± 0.063.12 × 10−211.5D246V293 ± 560.0092 ± 0.00073.66 × 10−529.1 ± 5.40.48 ± 0.021.63 × 10−252.2R253M233 ± 500.024 ± 0.0029.70 × 10−5176.5 ± 662.78 ± 1.21.58 × 10−2115.8Km and Kcat were derived from Michaelis-Menten plots of primer extension assays. Open table in a new tab Km and Kcat were derived from Michaelis-Menten plots of primer extension assays. The K m (AZT-TP) of both mutants was only slightly higher than that of WT. The most significant change in these reactions was in K cat (AZT-TP), which decreased almost an order of magnitude for D246V and 3-fold for R253M compared with WT. This produced a decrease in catalytic efficiency (K cat/K m) of AZT-TP one order of magnitude below WT for D246V, and 3.5-fold for R253M. The steady-state constants of the D246V mutant enzyme for dTTP incorporation were essentially the same as wild type (Table I), implying that the reaction with natural substrate was unaffected by the mutation. While R253M was equally competent at dTTP incorporation as measured by catalytic efficiency, it exhibited a 7-fold higherK m and 4-fold higher K cat. For this enzyme, the incorporation of dTTP is not compromised, but apparently proceeds via a kinetically altered pathway. The in vivo phenotypes, where R253M is the strongest cannot be explained by the kinetics of the AZT reaction alone. The drug-resistance phenotype seems to correlate well with the ratio of turnover numbersK cat(dTTP)/K cat(AZTTP). This ratio is increased from 11.5 for wild type to 52.2 in the moderately resistant D246V and 116 in the strong phenotype mutant R253M. We performed a gel mobility shift assay to determine whether the mutant enzymes had an altered affinity for primer-template DNA (Fig.5). The K D for DNA of WT pol β was 15.4 ± 5.7 nm, compared with 3.0 ± 1.1 nm for D246V and 12.7 ± 2.1 nm for R253M. Therefore, the R253M enzyme appears to interact with primer-template DNA with an affinity similar to that of WT pol β, while the D246V enzyme may bind slightly tighter. We found in this study that the addition of AZT to plating medium prevented WT pol β from functionally substituting for E. coli pol I. The E. coli cells are able to survive in the presence of the drug when they are not depending on pol β, demonstrating that the lethality of AZT results from its interaction with pol β. This evidence that pol β incorporates AZT-TP in physiological conditions confirms the findings of Bouayadi et al. (14Bouayadi K. Hoffmann J.S. Fons P. Tiraby M. Reynes J.P. Cazaux C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 110-116PubMed Google Scholar) that expression of pol β-sensitized mammalian cells in culture to AZT. Although incorporation of AZT-TP by pol β is inefficient compared with pol α (7Copeland W.C. Chen M.S. Wang T.S. J. Biol.

We exploited the AZT sensitivity exhibited by SC18-12 cells when depending on pol β to select AZT-resistant mutants of pol β. This approach allowed us to identify drug-resistant mutants within a large pool containing random mutations. These pol β mutants present an opportunity to examine the bi"

The preference of polymerase III HE for misalignment extension over direct mismatch extension provides a basis for explaining the in vitro (−1)-frameshift specificity of polymerase III HE. The error rate of a DNA polymerase depends not only on the efficiency with which it discriminates against incorrect nucleotides during the insertion step but also on its efficiency in continuing synthesis from the mismatched primer-terminus that it created by misinsertion. This is most obvious for enzymes containing an associated proofreading activity. Proofreading and mismatch extension compete, and a slow extension rate is likely to lead to very few mismatches being able to escape removal by the exonuclease. Thus, the ability to extend mismatches is an important factor in determining polymerase fidelity. The accuracy of the duplication of the genetic material in the bacterium Escherichia coli depends largely on the fidelity of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (HE), 1The abbreviations used are: HE, holoenzyme; dNTP, deoxynucleotide triphosphate; bp, base pair; RF, replicative form.1The abbreviations used are: HE, holoenzyme; dNTP, deoxynucleotide triphosphate; bp, base pair; RF, replicative form. which is responsible for its chromosome replication (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 165-182Google Scholar). The HE is a large dimeric complex composed of 10 distinct subunits that is capable of simultaneously synthesizing the leading and lagging strands of the replication forks (2McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27919-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have revealed that HE is quite accurate for base substitution errors. Interestingly, gap-filling synthesis of M13 DNA (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23575-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using a forward mutational assay capable of detecting various types of synthesis errors revealed HE to be relatively inaccurate for (−1)-frameshift mutations. In fact, (−1)-frameshifts were the major class of errors generated by HE in this assay (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23575-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Studies of (−1)-frameshift mutations have lead to the proposal of several general mechanisms for their formation. One model proposed by Streisinger et al. (8Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) postulates the occurrence of slippage of the nascent DNA strand in homopolymeric sequences (the direct slippage model). Within this model, the frameshift mutation frequency increases with the length of the run, because larger runs produce more (and more stable) misaligned intermediates. This model has been suggested to contribute to spontaneous frameshift mutations in vivo (9Farabaugh P.J. Schmeissner U. Hofer M. Miller J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 10Pribnow D. Sigurdson D.C. Gold L. Singer B.S. Napoli C. Brosius J. Dull T.J. Noller H.F. J. Mol.

Dunn R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) as well as frameshifts produced in vitroby a variety of DNA polymerases (13Kroutil L.C. Register K. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A second mechanism, the “misincorporation model” proposed by Kunkel and Soni (14Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), states that frameshift mutations can be initiated by misinsertion of a nucleotide. If the misinserted nucleotide is complementary to the next template base, then its 1-base forward misalignment can form a frameshift intermediate containing a correctly base-paired terminus (and an unpaired extra base in the template strand). As in the direct slippage model, this frameshift intermediate would be fixed into a (−1)-frameshift mutation by further extension. The misincorporation mechanism has been shown to operate duringin vitro DNA polymerization by the Klenow polymerase (15Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4946-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and human immunodeficiency virus type I reverse transcriptase (16Bebenek K. Roberts J. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3589-3596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A third possible model for (−1)-frameshifts generated by polymerase III HE in vitro results from recent work by Bloom et al. (7Bloom L.B. Chen X. Fygenson D.K. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27919-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), who observed elevated misincorporation by polymerase III HE in cases where the misincorporated base was complementary to the next template base. The authors proposed a transient misalignment before incorporation, in which the incoming (incorrect) dNTP is aligned on the next template base (dNTP-mediated misalignment). Continued DNA synthesis from the misaligned intermediate (after incorporation of the misaligned dNTP) would also generate a (−1)-frameshift. Based on a detailed analysis of in vitro mutation spectra produced by E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (both wild-type and MutD5), we had suggested that most of the observed (−1)-frameshift mutations produced by this enzyme occur via the misincorporation plus slippage mechanism (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23575-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the following observations: (i) most of the (−1)-frameshifts occurred at nonreiterated template positions, (ii) the (−1)-frameshift mutations were proofread with the same efficiency as the base substitution mutations, and (iii) (−1)-frameshift errors significantly increased under conditions of biased dNTP pools, specifically at template positions where the 5′ neighbor is complementary to the dNTP provided in excess (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23575-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We further suggested that the high level of (−1)-frameshift mutations created by this enzyme reflects a general inability to directly extend terminal mismatches and a greatly enhanced extension efficiency if the terminal mismatch can be misaligned on the next template base. In this study, we have further investigated the mismatch extension capability of the wild-type and MutD5 holoenzyme by using a fidelity assay specifically designed to measure the relative probabilities by which a polymerase chooses each of the three possible pathways upon encountering a mismatched primer-terminus: (i) direct extension (yielding a base substitution), (ii) misalignment extension (yielding a −1-frameshift), or (iii) exonucleolytic proofreading (yielding no mutation). We show that for a mispaired primer-template in which misalignment is not possible, HE preferentially proofreads the mispaired base (>99%). However, for a primer-template in which the terminal primer base is complementary to the next template base, the polymerase extends from the slipped intermediate to yield a (−1)-frameshift mutation in a significant fraction of the cases. These data support models in which the in vitro frameshift specificity of HE results from its relatively low efficiency in direct mispair extension compared with its efficiency in misalignment and extension of the misaligned intermediate. Bacteriophage M13mp2 and its mutant derivatives containing a T→G substitution at position 103 (mp2G103) or a G→A substitution at position 102 (mp2A102) in thelacZα gene were obtained from Dr. Katarzyna Bebenek (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC). Strains MC1061, which was used to prepare competent cells, and CSH50, which was used as an α-complementation host to score plaque color, were stocks of our laboratory. The holoenzymes from a wild-type and a mutD5 strain were purified as described previously (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol.

These fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel, and the 3135-bp fragment was purified from the gel by electroelution. The fragment was desalted and concentrated using a Microcon-50 microconcentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). To form the terminally mismatched heteroduplexes, the purified fragment was hybridized to single-stranded circular viral mp2 DNA that was either wild-type (G102, T103) or altered at position 102 (A102, T103) (see Fig. 1), as follows. The fragment was diluted to 5 μg/ml with water and incubated at 70 °C for 5 min to denature the strands. Single-stranded circular viral DNA was added (5 μg/ml, final concentration) just before removal from the 70 °C water bath, and the mixture was placed on ice. After 5 min, SSC was added to a final 2× concentration (300 mm NaCl and 30 mm sodium citrate), and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 60 °C, after which it was placed on ice. The resulting partial duplex DNA was desalted and concentrated by a Microcon-50 microconcentrator. Using a 1:1 ratio of fragment to viral DNA, about one-half of the single-stranded DNA was converted to partially heteroduplex molecules containing the terminal T·C mismatch at position 103 (Fig. 2,lane 1).Figure 2DNA synthesis by polymerase III holoenzyme from a mispaired primer-terminus.

Reactions were initiated by adding 135 units of MutD5 HE or 120 units of wild-type HE (1 unit = 1 pmol of nucleotide incorporated per minute). At defined time points (from 15 s to 5 min), the reaction mixtures were quenched by adding 2 μl of 200 mm EDTA. Extension reactions by the Klenow fragment (0.5 unit/reaction; 1 unit = 10 nmol of nucleotide incorporated per 30 min) were carried out for 30 min in the absence of single-stranded binding protein and ATP. The reactions were extracted twice with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel (70 V, 4 h). Full-length reaction products (RF II band) were cut out from the gel, and the DNA was extracted using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). The extracted DNA was desalted and concentrated into a 10-μl final volume using a Microcon-50 microconcentrator. 2 μl of gel-purified RF II DNA were used to transfect 50 μl of competent cells prepared fromE. coli strain MC1061 by electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) set at 2.01 kV, 400 W, 25 μF. Immediately after electroporation, 1 ml of SOC medium was added. Plating was performed by adding the transfected cells to 3 ml of melted soft agar (42 °C) containing 2.5 μg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 0.24 mg of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-thiogalactoside, and 0.25 ml of a mid-log culture of indicator strain CSH50. This mixture was poured onto minimal agar plates. The plates were inverted and incubated for 18–24 h at 37 °C, followed by an additional 24-h incubation at room temperature. Plaques were counted and classified according to their dark blue, light blue, or colorless phenotype. The frequencies of mispair extension and misalignment extension were calculated by dividing the frequency of light blue plaques or colorless plaques, respectively, by 0.55. The latter represents the average 55% expression probability of a mutation contained in the (−)-strand of a full-length RF II molecule (17Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kunkel T.A. Alexander P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 160-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The use of a mismatch repair-proficient strain, such as MC1061, is preferred in this assay because it minimizes the occurrence of mixed (blue/colorless) plaques that make it difficult to score the light blue phenotype (17Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kunkel T.A. Alexander P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 160-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine how E. coli DNA polymerase III HE processes terminal mismatches in vitro, we used a fidelity assay that permits distinction between the different pathways available to the polymerase upon encountering a primer-template containing a 3′ terminal mismatch. The mismatched substrates used in this study are described in Fig. 1. They are based on the M13mp2lacZ α-complementation system and use differential plaque colors to distinguish the various reaction products. They represent a modification from those originally described by Kunkel and co-workers (17Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Roberts J.D. Preston B.D. Johnston L.A. Soni A. Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1990; 265: 13878-13887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which have been used to assess terminal mispair utilization by a number of different polymerases. Instead of using duplex DNA containing a small gap, we have constructed half-duplex M13mp2 molecules consisting of a 3135-bp duplex region and a 4061-bp single-stranded region. The 3135-bp primer contains the terminal mismatch. Upon synthesis by polymerase III HE, the full-length RF II products can be readily separated from the starting molecules using a 0.8% agarose gel (see Fig. 2), thus allowing us to recover and separately analyze the full-length extension products. This feature is important for assaying rapid and highly processive polymerases such as HE, because it permits the analysis of extension products at very short reaction times, even when not all substrates are bound or extended. Two substrates were prepared, both of which contained a T·C mismatch at the 3′ end of the primer strand (position 103 of thelacZα sequence) (Fig. 1). In one substrate, the next template nucleotide to be copied is a G, in the other substrate, it is an A. In both cases, the template strand is phenotypically wild-type (dark blue plaque), because the G→A change at position 102 is silent (17Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mismatched C in the primer strand is derived from a T→G base substitution mutant at position 103, which produces a light blue plaque. There are three possible outcomes for these two substrates when processed by HE. First, HE may simply extend the mispaired terminus C, creating a RF II heteroduplex molecule containing a base substitution mutation in the (−)-strand. Upon transfection, this molecule will yield a light blue plaque. (Actually, due to the action of mismatch repair on the internal mismatch, upon transfection into the competent cells, the probability of producing a light blue plaque is about 55%; the remaining 45% carry the (+)-strand genotype and will be dark blue. The 55% (−)-strand expression efficiency has been determined experimentally for a large series of base·base and frameshift mismatches (17Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kunkel T.A. Alexander P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 160-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Second, in the case of the G-containing substrate, the terminal mismatched C may first misalign on the next template base G, followed by the extension of this misaligned structure. Upon transfection, this will yield (again at 55% efficiency) a mp2 frameshift mutant with a colorless plaque phenotype. Third, instead of extending the terminal mismatch, HE may remove the mispaired C by exonucleolytic proofreading. Upon extension, this would produce a wild-type dark blue plaque. Thus, a simple enumeration of light blue, colorless, and dark blue plaques reveals the fate of the terminal mismatch upon polymerization. Extension reactions were performed for each DNA substrate with wild-type or MutD5 HE at two different dNTP concentrations: 50 and 1000 μm. The reaction products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 2), and full-length RF II molecules were purified and analyzed by transfection. Time-course experiments showed that the RF II product had already appeared after 15 s of reaction time, as expected for a rapid and highly processive enzyme such as HE (data not shown). As a control, we also performed extension reactions with the Klenow fragment (exo−; see “Experimental Procedures”). The data in Fig. 3 show that with the substrate containing the T·C mispair followed by a template A (right panel), most of plaques scored (>99%) in reactions with either the wild-type or MutD5 HE were dark blue, indicating that proofreading of the terminal base was the predominant outcome. The failure to detect light blue or colorless plaques even for the MutD5 HE, which possesses only limited (∼5%) exonuclease activity (5Fersht A.R. Knill-Jones J.W. Tsui W.-C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), indicates that HE is very inefficient in extending directly from the mispaired terminus. Extension by MutD5 HE of the substrate containing the T·C mispair with the 5′ neighboring template G (Fig. 3, left panel) yielded high numbers of colorless and dark blue plaques and significantly fewer light blue plaques. Sequencing of randomly selected colorless and light blue plaques (10 each) showed that all colorless mutants had lost template T at the site of mispair, and that all light blue mutants carried the expected T to G base change at position 103. The proportion of colorless and light blue plaques was lower when the dNTP concentration was decreased from 1000 to 50 μm, reflecting the stimulatory effect of high dNTP concentrations on the two forward reactions as they compete with the proofreading step (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23575-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The data with the G-containing substrate demonstrate that MutD5 HE is highly proficient in forming and extending a (−1)-frameshift intermediate (when permitted by the sequence context) as compared with direct extension of the mismatch, which is inefficient. The wild-type enzyme at either dNTP concentration produces a majority of dark blue plaques, indicating that proofreading is the predominating pathway. Nevertheless, among the mutants, colorless plaques outnumber the light blue plaques, indicating that misalignment extension is strongly preferred over direct extension in this case also. Note that the Klenow fragment greatly prefers direct extension over misalignment extension, as seen from the excess of light blue plaques versuscolorless plaques (Fig. 3). In Table I, we present the calculated probabilities for the G-containing substrate for each of the three pathways. At 1000 μm dNTP, the MutD5 HE chooses the misalignment extension pathway in 61% of the cases. The direct extension pathway is chosen in only 6% of the cases, while 33% of the mismatches are proofread. At 50 μm dNTP, the proportion of proofread molecules increases to 80.8%, whereas 17.8% are processed by misalignment extension, and only 1.5% are directly extended. Thus, the ratio between direct extension and extension from a misaligned intermediate at either dNTP concentration is about 1:10. The wild-type HE, which has a strong exonucleolytic proofreading activity (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23575-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), prefers to excise the mispaired C before polymerization. However, at 1000 μm dNTP, about 2% of the primer-templates are processed by HE to yield the (−1)-frameshift mutation, whereas only 0.1% is directly extended. Reactions sampled at different time points between 15 s and 5 min yielded the same ratios between direct extension, misalignment extension, or proofreading (data not shown). Because smaller HE subassemblies (core, polymerase III′, polymerase III*) cannot synthesize the required long stretch (∼4000 bp) of DNA within a short time (and in the presence of single-stranded binding protein), there can be little doubt that the observed products are made by HE. The results obtained with HE are in contrast to those obtained with the Klenow polymerase: this enzyme efficiently extended the mispaired C (95%) and only rarely chose the misalignment pathway (5%).Table IProbabilities (%) of misalignment extension, direct extension, and proofreading during extension reactions of DNA substrate containing a T·C terminal mismatch with a 5′ template GaProbabilities of misalignment extension and direct extension were calculated from the data in Fig. 3, making a correction for the average (−)-strand expression value of 55% (see Refs. 17 and18 and the text).

Open table in a new tab The data obtained in this study reveal properties of E. coli DNA polymerase III HE that appear to be unique among the polymerases tested to date. First, when presented with a preformed terminal mismatch, direct extension of the mismatch by the enzyme to yield the expected base substitution is extremely infrequent. For example, for the A-containing substrate (Fig. 1), only about 0.2% is extended to yield the expected base substitution (Fig. 3), with the vast majority (>99.8%) being removed by proofreading. This is true even for the proofreading-impaired HE purified from themutD5 mutator strain, in which only 5% or less of the exonuclease activity remains (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23575-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Secondly, when presented with a terminal mismatch in a sequence context in which the terminal base in the primer strand is complementary to the next template base (the G-containing substrate; see Fig. 1), extension is greatly facilitated but now takes place from the misaligned intermediate, yielding a (−1)-frameshift instead of the base substitution mutation. In the case of the proofreading-impaired enzyme, this second pathway significantly exceeds the exonuclease pathway (61 versus 33%; see TableI). For the wild-type enzyme, proofreading still predominates; however, most significantly, misalignment extension exceeds direct extension by 20:1 (Table I). This strong bias favoring misalignment extension over direct extension is unique to polymerase III, because other enzymes for which misalignment extension has been documented, such as Klenow fragment (15Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4946-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Bebenek K. Joyce C.M. Fitzgerald M.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13878-13887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), avian myeloblastosis virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptases (19Roberts J.D. Preston B.D. Johnston L.A. Soni A. Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), mammalian polymerase β (19Roberts J.D. Preston B.D. Johnston L.A. Soni A. Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and yeast polymerase I (20Kunkel T.A. Hamatake R.K. Motto-Fox J. Fitzgerald M.P. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4447-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), generally produce the frameshift mutation less efficiently than the base substitution. To illustrate the extreme tendency of polymerase III HE in this respect, we compared the enzyme side by side with the Klenow fragment. This enzyme also performed misalignment extension, but at only 5% of the rate of the direct extension (Table I). The present data on mismatch extension by HE are relevant for explaining the unusual spectrum of in vitro errors produced by HE in a forward mutagenesis assay using the lacI gene as a mutational target (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23575-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In these spectra, wild-type and MutD5 HE produced a majority of (−1)-frameshift mutations at nonreiterated sequences. We proposed (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23575-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that these frameshifts originated as base misinsertion errors that failed to be extended by the enzyme but were processed efficiently by extension from the slipped intermediate in sequence contexts where the next template base is complementary to the misinserted base. The present data demonstrating the clear preference for misalignment extension over direct extension when HE is faced with a (preformed) 3′ terminal mismatch are fully consistent with this model. Although a preformed terminal mismatch may not resemble a mismatch created during ongoing DNA synthesis in all respects, the behavior displayed by HE is striking and must reflect some property of HE that is likely relevant during ongoing DNA synthesis as well. An important alternative context in which to consider the tendency of HE to create (−1)-frameshifts is provided by the “dNTP-stabilized misalignment” model proposed by Bloom et al. (7Bloom L.B. Chen X. Fygenson D.K. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27919-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These investigators noted increased misincorporation by HE on an oligonucleotide template under conditions in which the misincorporating nucleotide was complementary to the next template base. The findings were interpreted to indicate that the polymerase is able to read ahead and use the information provided by the next template position to direct (mis)incorporation. First of all, this model provides an alternative mode of misincorporation by HE compared with direct base·base misinsertion. If correct, both base·base mismatching and misincorporation by dNTP-stabilized misalignment may provide the terminally mismatched substrates that HE may extend from either the aligned or misaligned state. Secondly, provided that the primer-terminus remains in the misaligned state after phosphodiester bond formation, the reaction product of a misincorporation via dNTP-stabilized misalignment is the same as the intermediate that we suggested to arise from a standard misincorporation and subsequent forward misalignment. This feature of the dNTP-stabilized misalignment model for misincorporation makes it a potentially attractive pathway for the generation of the (−1)-frameshifts observed in vitro (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23575-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, if the forward extension rate is slow relative to the interconversion of the aligned and misaligned states, then any distinction with regard to the initial mode of misincorporation would disappear. Finally, it is likely that the preferred usage of misaligned intermediates by HE and misincorporation by dNTP-stabilized misalignment are manifestations of the same, unusual enzymological property of HE that allows the enzyme to generate and/or use misaligned intermediates with relatively high efficiency. This property, which is obviously relevant for the fidelity of the enzyme, is most intriguing and deserves further investigation. In addition to providing insight into the mechanism of frameshift mutagenesis by HE, our present study also provides information about the contribution of proofreading to in vitro fidelity. The data from Table I indicate that for the MutD5 enzyme, 33 and 81% of the terminal mismatches are proofread at 1000 and 50 μmdNTP, respectively; for the wild-type enzyme, these numbers are 97.8 and 99.6%, respectively. Converted into fidelity factors (the fold reduction in mutant fraction due to proofreading), the proofreading activity of MutD5 HE contributes 1.5-fold [100/(100–33)] and 5.3-fold [100/(100–81)] to the accuracy of extension synthesis at the two dNTP concentrations, respectively, whereas for the wild-type enzyme, these factors are 45- and 250-fold. Thus, the efficiency of the MutD5 proofreading activity is reduced between 30- and 47-fold compared with the wild-type enzyme. These data are consistent with direct measurements of the exonuclease deficiency associated with the MutD5 enzyme taken in the absence of dNTPs that indicated that the exonuclease activity was decreased 26- to 47-fold (6Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23575-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that in the present experiments, which use a preformed terminal mismatch, proofreading correlates directly with the strength of the exonuclease. Interestingly, this correlation does not appear to hold for the proofreading contribution during ongoing in vitroDNA synthesis, in which we measured only a 4- to 6-fold difference in the error rates (for both base substitutions and frameshifts) between the wild-type and the MutD5 enzyme. This may be due to a different binding mode of the enzyme in the two assays. Possibly, upon initial binding to a primer, HE preferentially binds with the primer in the exonuclease subunit, as has been shown to be the case for T7 DNA polymerase (22Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In contrast, during ongoing DNA synthesis, the terminal nucleotide is in the polymerase active site, and a kinetic barrier may exist for transfer to the exonuclease site. Whereas this study provides new insights into the fidelity behavior of the replicative complex of E. coli, numerous questions still remain. Poor extension from terminal mismatches can be readily seen as a valuable attribute for a high fidelity enzyme because it will greatly increase the potential for exonucleolytic removal, but it is not clear why a high tendency to transform a terminal mismatch into a frameshift intermediate is particularly useful. This tendency seems to be a property intrinsic to the α subunit, because a similar frameshift predominance was observed in fidelity experiments performed with the isolated α subunit (23Mo J.-Y. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18947-18953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Apparently, the numerous other subunits present in the HE do not play a significant role in preventing these frameshifts. However, because high levels of frameshift mutagenesis are not observed in vivo (even before the action of mismatch repair) (24Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23762-23765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the question of how they are prevented inside the cell is interesting. We suggest that this additional mode of error prevention is somehow related to the functioning of HE at the in vivoreplication fork. Further experiments will be needed to address this important question. We thank Drs. T. Kunkel and K. Bebenek of National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for kindly providing the mutant M13mp2 phages used in this study. We thank Drs. K. Bebenek and W.

The correct lysosomal targeting of soluble lysosomal enzymes mainly depends on the synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate residues on their N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. These mannose 6-phosphate residues are lysosomal targeting signals. In the late Golgi compartments, lysosomal enzymes bind to mannose 6-phosphate receptors, which mediate the vesicular transport to the lysosomes (for review, see Refs. 1Kornfeld S. Melman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar and 2von Figura K. Naturwissenschaften. 1990; 77: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate residues is a two-step process: in the first reaction the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzymeN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.8.17) (briefly called phosphotransferase 1The abbreviations used are: phosphotransferase, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzymeN-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphotransferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SNA, sulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimidylacetate; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride.1The abbreviations used are: phosphotransferase, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzymeN-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphotransferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SNA, sulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimidylacetate; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride.) transfers N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to mannose residues of high mannose-type oligosaccharide side chains of lysosomal enzymes yieldingN-acetylglucosamine-1-phospho-6-mannose residues. In a second reaction the N-acetylglucosamine is removed by a phosphodiesterase generating mannose 6-phosphate residues on the oligosaccharide side chains (1Kornfeld S. Melman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). The phosphotransferase has been purified to homogeneity (3Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is a large enzyme of two disulfide linked homodimers of 166 and 51 kDa and two noncovalently linked 56-kDa subunits. The holoenzyme has a molecular mass of 540 kDa (4Bao M. Elmendorf B.J. Booth J.L. Drake R.R. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31446-31451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The specific recognition of soluble lysosomal enzymes by the phosphotransferase is the critical step for proper intracellular targeting of these enzymes. Thus, the phosphotransferase must be able to specifically recognize lysosomal enzymes, but since these represent a heterogeneous family of proteins, it must also be able to interact with structurally very diverse enzymes. No obvious sequence similarities suggesting a common homologous targeting signal can be detected among lysosomal enzymes. Earlier studies demonstrated that the specific recognition of lysosomal enzymes by the phosphotransferase depends on the native conformation of lysosomal enzymes (5Lang L. Reitman M. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, various studies tried to characterize the recognition determinants of lysosomal enzymes employing in vitromutagenesis strategies. In the COOH-terminal lobe of lysosomal protease cathepsin D, two regions have been delineated to be a minimal determinant for recognition by the lysosomal enzyme phosphotransferase, a lysine in position 203 and a stretch of 32 amino acid close to the COOH terminus (6Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Crystallographic structure determinations revealed that those critical residues are in close proximity on the surface of cathepsin D (7Metcalf P. Fusek M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1293-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, further studies showed that regions in the NH2-terminal lobe of cathepsin D also contribute to efficient recognition by the phosphotransferase (8Baranski T.J. Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23342-23348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cantor A.B. Baranski T.J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that various distantly spaced residues may act cooperatively to yield the fully effective sorting signal. Similar conclusions have been reached for aspartylglucosaminidase, in which three lysines distantly spaced on the enzyme surface contribute to the proper recognition by the phosphotransferase (11Tikkanen R. Peltola M. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and for cathepsin D and L in each of which two lysines approximately 34 Å apart are critical recognition determinants (12Cuozzo J.W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) indicated that recognition of lysosomal enzymes depends on lysines as critical residues. Besides the identification of lysines as a common feature of the lysosomal enzyme recognition determinant, its overall structure remains unknown. Comparisons of three-dimensional structures of recently crystallized lysosomal enzymes suggested that a loose consensus sequence in a β-hairpin structure may be common to several lysosomal enzymes (15Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grupp J.H. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Whether this sequence is indeed part of the recognition determinant common to all lysosomal enzymes remains to be proven. Arylsulfatases A (EC 3.1.6.8) and arylsulfatase B (EC 3.1.6.12) are lysosomal enzymes involved in the degradation of sulfated glycolipids and glycosaminoglycans, respectively. Arylsulfatase A is synthesized as a 62-kDa polypeptide, which bears three high mannose-type oligosaccharide side chains, two of which are phosphorylated by the phosphotransferase (16Gieselmann V. Schmidt B. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13262-13266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sommerlade H.J. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Neifer K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20977-20981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The position of the recognition determinant in lysosomal arylsulfatase A and homologous sulfatases is unknown. Since our current knowledge on the requirements of the interaction of the lysosomal enzymes with the phosphotransferase is based on the introduction of targeted amino acid substitutions we have chosen to characterize phosphotransferase recognition determinant on arylsulfatase A with monoclonal antibodies. Recently, we reported the generation of four monoclonal antibodies specific for human arylsulfatase A (18Sommerlade H.J. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fab fragments of these antibodies inhibited the synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate residues on arylsulfatase A in anin vitro phosphorylation system. Epitope mapping revealed that these antibodies recognized identical or adjacent epitopes on the enzyme, and it was assumed that the epitope was part of or close to the phosphotransferase recognition determinant. In order to extend this study and to map the recognition determinant more precisely, we have generated eight additional antibodies and examined their ability to interfere with mannose phosphorylation. Cell culture media RPMI 1640 for hybridomas and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for all other cell types were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum was obtained from Biochrom. DNA digesting and DNA modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs or Life Technologies, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham.

Female BALB/c mice 6 weeks of age were injected three times (day 1, 14, and 28) intraperitoneally with 100 μg of arylsulfatase A. Recombinant enzyme was purified by immunoaffinity purification as described earlier (18Sommerlade H.J. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Prior to injection the enzyme was adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide. Anti-arylsulfatase A titers were monitored 12 days after the last immunization. Animals scoring positive were boosted with 50 μg of arylsulfatase A and sacrificed 3 days later. Spleen cells of mice were fused with X63-Ag8.653 myeloma cells. Fusion was done as described (21Peters J.H. Baumgarten H. Monoclonal Antibodies. Springer Verlag, Stuttgart1992Crossref Google Scholar). After fusion, cells were plated in 200 wells of 24-well hybridoma plates (Greiner) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycine, 100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, 16 μm thymidine (Boehringer-Mannheim). The medium was further supplemented with 10% conditioned medium from the J774 cell line. Wells containing anti-arylsulfatase A immunoglobuline secreting hybridomas were identified via a radioimmunoassay in which an iodinated secondary anti-mouse light chain antibody raised in rabbits was used (Dakopatts, Copenhagen). Clones in positive cells were subcloned and reanalyzed by radioimmunoassay. Immunoglobulin subclass determination was performed with a kit from Boehringer-Mannheim. MAbs A3, C, E, and F are IgG1; mAbs A1, A2, and A4 are IgG2a; and A5 is IgG2b. All antibodies have κ-light chains. In part of the experiments three previously published mAbs have been used (18Sommerlade H.J. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To facilitate reading of this article these antibodies have been renamed, 19C2 is B1, 20D2 is B2, and 11B5 is D. Hybridomas were cultured in the Hereaus Miniperm system, which in all cases yielded several milligrams of mAbs. IgG2 mAbs were purified via affinity chromatography on Protein A-Sepharose and IgG1 on Protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia). Affinity chromatography was performed according to the manufacturers protocols. For production of Fab fragments, purified antibodies were adjusted to a concentration of 1–5 mg in phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm cysteine. Papain was added at a molar ratio of 1:40 mol of IgG. Depending on the antibody, proteolysis was performed at 37 °C for 1 to 4 h. Reaction was terminated by the addition of iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 20 mm. Fab fragments were purified by gel filtration on a Superdex G-75 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitation of unlabeled arylsulfatase A under nondenaturing conditions was performed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100. Five to 10 milliunits of arylsulfatase A were incubated with 10 μg of antibodies for 12–16 h. To enhance precipitation, 10 μg of goat anti-mouse affinity purified antibodies (Dianova) were added for another 2 h before Ig were collected by the addition of 60 μl ofStaphylococcus aureus suspension (Pansorbin, Calbiochem). After 30 min of continuous shaking, bacteria were pelleted for 4 min at 10,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer and washed once. Arylsulfatase A activity was determined in supernatants and pellets. 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated with 125 ng of mAbs and subsequently blocked with an excess of casein. Simultaneously, arylsulfatase A was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of mAb in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl. MAb-arylsulfatase A complexes generated in liquid phase were then added to the mAb-coated wells and allowed to bind for 2 h at 37 °C. Afterward liquid phase was removed, the wells were washed twice, and arylsulfatase A bound to the wells was quantified by activity determination (18Sommerlade H.J. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). If the antibody coupled to the well and complexed to the arylsulfatase A in the liquid phase compete and thus cannot bind arylsulfatase A simultaneously, the enzyme cannot be retained in the wells. 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated with 100 ng of arylsulfatase A/well for 16 h at 4 °C. Purified arylsulfatase A can be labeled via incubation with [35S]cysteine. 2F. Dietz, unpublished data. 35S-Labeled arylsulfatase A was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of mAbs. The antibody complexed with [35S]arylsulfatase A was added to the wells at neutral pH when octamerization of arylsulfatase A does not occur. Then pH of the wells was titrated to pH 4.5 and incubation continued for 1 h. Low pH favors octamerization of arylsulfatase A so that arylsulfatase A-antibody complexes should bind to solid phase arylsulfatase A if the antibody does not interfere with octamerization. Liquid phase was removed and wells were washed with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. Radioactivity bound to the plates was determined. As a control a duplicate plate was washed with neutral buffer, which reverses association of [35S]arylsulfatase A with arylsulfatase A bound to the wells. Preparation of Golgi membranes, [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc and arylsulfatase A by immunoaffinity chromatography has been described in detail (18Sommerlade H.J. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Lang L. Kornfeld S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Purified arylsulfatase B was kindly provided by M. Evers and C. Peters, Freiburg, Germany. Quantification of radioactivity after SDS-PAGE was done with a Fuji Bioimager. To modify carboxyl residues 50 μg of arylsulfatase A or arylsulfatase B were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and samples were divided into two parts of 50 μl each. One part received no addition and served as a control, the other part was supplemented with 20 mm1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydroxychloride (EDC) and 100 mm ethylendiamide. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by increasing sodium acetate concentration to 0.66 m. Treated and untreated samples were subsequently dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline. To modify amino groups of lysines, 50 μg of arylsulfatase A or arylsulfatase B were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, and samples were split into two aliquots. One aliquot received no additions and to the other 17.5 mmsulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl acetate (SNA) was added. Incubation was for 90 min on ice and reaction was terminated by dialysis against Tris-buffered saline. In each case, the success of the modification reaction was monitored by alterations in isoelectric focussing pattern. Mice were immunized with recombinant human arylsulfatase A and a total of 8 stable hybridomas secreting anti-arylsulfatase A antibodies were obtained. These antibodies precipitated arylsulfatase A under nondenaturing conditions from extracts of Ltk− cells overexpressing the human arylsulfatase A cDNA. Since the sum of enzyme activity remaining in the supernatant (in all cases less than 10%) and bound to the mAbs in the pellet was in the same range as the activity in the supernatant when a irrelevant control antibody was used, it can be concluded that the antibodies do not interfere with arylsulfatase A activity (data not shown). All mAbs recognize human arylsulfatase A specifically, they do not precipitate rat or murine arylsulfatase A (less than 10% in all cases). They do not cross-react with arylsulfatase B an enzyme highly homologous to arylsulfatase A. None of the mAbs recognizes arylsulfatase A under denaturing conditions as revealed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate residues, which represent the specific lysosomal targeting signal can be performed in vitro (18Sommerlade H.J. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Lang L. Kornfeld S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Purified lysosomal enzymes are incubated with a Golgi fraction as a source of lysosomal enzyme phosphotransferase and [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc from which the radioactively labeled 32P is transferred to the oligosaccharide side chains of the substrate enzymes. Subsequently, phosphorylation is detected by SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography. Fig. 1 shows an experiment in which recombinant arylsulfatase A purified to apparent homogeneity was phosphorylated in vitro in the absence or presence of control or anti-arylsulfatase A mAbs. Addition of an irrelevant control mAb has no effect on arylsulfatase A phosphorylation, whereas all mAbs (top panel) or their Fab fragments (bottom panel) inhibited phosphorylation almost completely. Addition of anti-arylsulfatase A mAbs or Fab fragments did not inhibit phosphorylation of arylsulfatase B, which was co-phosphorylated in the same sample, excluding nonspecific inhibition of phosphorylation by the addition of anti-arylsulfatase A mAbs. Inhibition of arylsulfatase A phosphorylation may be explained in two ways. 1) The antibodies inhibit recognition of arylsulfatase A by the phosphotransferase, because they mask the determinant responsible for lysosomal enzyme recognition. In this case the arylsulfatase A-mAb complexes will not be able to interact with the phosphotransferase. 2) The antibodies may still allow arylsulfatase A to be recognized by the phosphotransferase as a lysosomal enzyme, but after binding, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides is sterically inhibited by the anti-arylsulfatase A mAbs. To differentiate between these possibilities, we developed an assay in which arylsulfatase A inhibits the phosphorylation of arylsulfatase B competitively. If arylsulfatase A-mAb complexes can still bind to the phosphotransferase, they should be able to compete arylsulfatase B phosphorylation. If the mAbs prevent arylsulfatase A from interacting with the phosphotransferase, arylsulfatase A-mAb complexes should not compete arylsulfatase B phosphorylation. Fig. 2 shows results of three independent phosphorylation experiments. In these experiments arylsulfatase B and arylsulfatase A were co-phosphorylated in the same reaction. Arylsulfatase A was added in about 10-fold molar excess over arylsulfatase B. Addition of arylsulfatase A inhibits arylsulfatase B phosphorylation by about 40%. In all cases addition of anti-arylsulfatase A Fab fragments abolishes the inhibitory effect of arylsulfatase A on arylsulfatase B phosphorylation. Thus, Fab fragments of all mAbs prevent interaction of arylsulfatase A with the phosphotransferase. The importance of lysines for lysosomal enzyme recognition has been documented for several lysosomal enzymes (6Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S.

In order to investigate the role of lysines in sulfatases, purified arylsulfatase A and arylsulfatase B were treated with EDC and SNA to modify glutamate/aspartate carboxylic groups and amino groups of lysines, respectively (Fig. 3). EDC in combination with ethylenediamine converts carboxylic groups of glutamate and aspartate to the corresponding amides, SNA causes acetylation of amino groups of lysines. Modification of carboxyl groups affects arylsulfatase A and arylsulfatase B in vitro phosphorylation only slightly causing a reduction of phosphorylation by about 30–40% (see Fig. 3). In contrast, lysine modification inhibited phosphorylation of arylsulfatase A and arylsulfatase B completely. In case of modification of carboxylic groups, the enzyme activity of arylsulfatase A was lost, whereas acetylation of lysines left enzyme activity unchanged (data not shown). This excludes that an unspecific denaturing effect of the modifications accounts for the loss of phosphorylation. Thus, lysines are essential for the recognition of arylsulfatase A and arylsulfatase B by the lysosomal enzyme phosphotransferase. The fact that all mAbs inhibited the interaction of arylsulfatase A with the lysosomal enzyme phosphotransferase raises the question of specificity. The mAbs may interfere unspecifically with any protein-protein interactions of arylsulfatase A simply by size. To get a measure of the specificity of mAb inhibition of phosphorylation we have investigated the influence of the mAbs on another protein-protein interaction of arylsulfatase A that can be performed in vitro. This is the pH-dependent octamerization of arylsulfatase A. At neutral pH, arylsulfatase A exists as a dimer, which upon acidification associates to form octamers (23Lukatela G. Krauß N. Theis K. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Saenger W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3654-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To examine whether the mAbs interfere with octamerization, 100 ng of purified arylsulfatase A was adsorbed to a 96-well microtiter plate. 35S-Labeled arylsulfatase A was added at neutral pH to the wells. Afterward, pH in the wells was titrated to pH 4.5 under continuous shaking. At low pH, some of the fluid phase 35S-labeled arylsulfatase A should associate with arylsulfatase A bound to the solid phase via interaction of the octamerization domain. If wells are washed at pH 4.5, labeled arylsulfatase A remains bound to the solid phase (bars Co pH 4.5 in Fig. 4) whereas washing at neutral pH reverses octamerization and removes most of the bound [35S]arylsulfatase A (bars Co pH 7.4 in Fig.4). To investigate whether mAbs interfere with this pH-dependent octamerization process, mAbs were added either to the wells to bind to solid phase arylsulfatase A before labeled fluid phase [35S]arylsulfatase A was added (light bars in Fig. 4) or mAbs were preincubated with fluid phase [35S]arylsulfatase A before addition to wells (dark bars, Fig. 4). After titration to pH 4.5 and shaking for 1 h, wells were washed at pH 4.5 and counts remaining in the wells were determined. Compared with control mAb, none of the arylsulfatase A-specific mAbs inhibited binding of fluid phase [35S]arylsulfatase A to solid phase enzyme, irrespective whether mAbs were incubated with the fluid phase [35S]arylsulfatase A or unlabeled arylsulfatase A bound to the wells. Radioactivity in all wells could be removed by subsequent washing at neutral pH, which reverses octamerization (data not shown). Control experiments showing that arylsulfatase A-mAb complexes are stable at pH 4.5 have been performed (data not shown). To evaluate how many different epitopes are recognized by the mAbs, we investigated which of the mAbs can bind simultaneously to arylsulfatase A. Wells of a 96-well microtiter plate were precoated with the eight anti-arylsulfatase A mAbs and with a control antibody. Arylsulfatase A was preincubated with a 10-fold molar excess of antibodies for 16 h and then added to the wells containing the immobilized mAbs. In case arylsulfatase A-bound mAbs compete binding of the immobilized mAbs arylsulfatase A should not bind to the immobilized mAbs in the wells. After 3 h incubation of arylsulfatase A-mAb complexes in the wells, wells were washed and arylsulfatase A remaining in the wells was quantified by activity determination. Results are shown in Table I.Table ICompetition assay of monoclonal antibody binding to human arylsulfatase AImmobilized mAbsmAbs bound to ASAA1A2A3A4A5CEFB1B2COA1000001126110000100A22001614169581930097A330000010110010000101A43000075977900104A511001093100900099C10691829192057101919199E12111390107101001398114100F106717494108664407181100B1000001291131030nd100B20038010110498nd0100Wells of a 96-well microtiter plate were coated with 125 ng each of the mAbs listed in the left vertical lane.

Amide resonance shifts that were observed in a1H15N-HSQC-monitored titration of15N-labeled protein with the oligonucleotide dT18 indicate that binding of the nucleic acid occurs by means of two anti-parallel channels that were previously identified in the PC4CTD crystal structure.

The eukaryotic general transcriptional cofactor PC4 is known to enhance activated in vitro and in vivotranscription from various RNA polymerase II promoters, in concert with members of all major classes of transcriptional activators (1Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 2Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

The activator-dependent stimulation of transcription by PC4 has been shown to originate mostly from increased recruitment of basal transcription factors during the early stages of preinitiation complex (PIC) 1The abbreviations used are: PIC, preinitiation complex; RPA, replication protein A; ss, single-stranded; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect.1The abbreviations used are: PIC, preinitiation complex; RPA, replication protein A; ss, single-stranded; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. formation (4Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3520-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is likely that this effect is caused by the interactions that have been reported between PC4 and the activation domains of promoter-binding activator proteins on the one hand, and basal factors (including TFIIA) on the other (1Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 3Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, PC4 appears to act as a bridging factor that stabilizes the preinitiation complex. Recently it has become clear that PC4 has several additional functions. In the first place, the protein was found to be able to repress transcription under specific conditions (5Malik S. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.W.M. Gros P. Timmers H.Th.M. Van der Vliet P.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Repression at moderate PC4 concentrations is observed in minimal in vitrotranscription systems, that normally do not require the basal factor TFIIH (5Malik S. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.W.M. Gros P. Timmers H.Th.M. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and with respect to aspecific transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II from DNA ends and unwound regions (6Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.W.M. Gros P. Timmers H.Th.M. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Repression is not observed in full-factor in vitro transcription, because TFIIH is able to overcome repression by PC4 (5Malik S. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.W.M. Gros P. Timmers H.Th.M. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, PC4 appears to act as what could be called a fidelity-enhancing factor for RNA polymerase II transcription initiation by repressing adventitious transcription from incomplete PICs on the one hand, and on the other hand enhancing transcription from fully assembled PICs, i.e.those that include TFIIH, generally believed to be the last factor to enter the PIC during assembly (8Roeder R.G. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, PC4 has recently also been found to associate in vivo with the RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIC and to stimulate transcription by RNA polymerase III by increasing the rate of reinitiation (9Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, copurification of PC4 with the human replication protein A (RPA) and effects of PC4 observed in a reconstituted SV40 replication system suggested that the protein may play a further role in DNA replication (10Pan Z.-Q. Ge H. Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22111-22116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, it is emerging that PC4 is an extremely versatile factor, involved in the processing of genetic information at multiple levels. Although stimulation of RNA polymerase II transcription by PC4 is probably largely effected by protein-protein interactions depending on the N-terminal half of the protein, the C-terminal half of the protein in addition comprises a powerful ssDNA-binding domain (3Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M.

Biol. 1998; 276: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The physiological role of this domain has long remained enigmatic. Recently, binding of single-stranded DNA was found to be entirely dispensable for transcription activation by PC4 but strictly required for repression of transcription in the absence of TFIIH (6Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.W.M. Gros P. Timmers H.Th.M. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Earlier analysis of PC4CTD (12Werten S. Langen F.W.M. Van Schaik R. Timmers H.Th.M. Meisterernst M. Van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) has shown that it binds with nanomolar affinity to juxtaposed stretches of ssDNA running in opposite directions, such as present in partially melted double-stranded DNA or heteroduplexes. Optimal binding to such structures requires approximately 8 unpaired nucleotides in each of the two strands. Single-stranded oligonucleotides can be bound with almost equal affinity, provided these molecules contain a minimum of 16–20 nucleotides. These observations support the idea that ssDNA has to be bent 180° to create an arrangement of anti-parallel strands similar to the topology of a heteroduplex for PC4 to bind. Earlier, the crystal structure of PC4CTD was solved (13Brandsen J. Werten S. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. Kroon J. Gros P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This structure revealed a novel homodimeric fold in which each monomer consists of a curved four-stranded β-sheet and a 45°-kinked α-helix, both contributing to a complex dimerization interface. A prominent feature of the structure is the presence of two channel-like depressions running in anti-parallel directions. These channels, formed by the curved β-sheets, are lined both by positively charged and aromatic residues, suggesting involvement in ssDNA binding in a manner similar to the DNA binding mode of other single-stranded DNA-binding proteins such as RPA (14Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the channels that were identified indeed constitute the DNA binding surface of PC4CTD, we have studied this protein domain and its interaction with a single-stranded oligonucleotide by means of heteronuclear NMR. PC4CTD was overexpressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) using pET-11a (Novagen) constructs. The PC4CTD construct encodes amino acids 63–127 of the full-length protein, preceded by Met-Ala, originating from the vector sequence. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in synthetic medium (6.0 g/liter Na2HPO4, 2H2O, 3.0 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 1.0 mm MgSO4, 0.2 μg/liter FeCl3, 20 μm CaCl2, 0.5 mg/liter thiamine) containing 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and either 4.0 g/liter 12C-glucose, or 1.0 g/liter13C-glucose as the only carbon source. Induction took place at an A 600 nm of 0.5, by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 4 h the cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Na2S2O5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 500 mm KCl and lysed by freeze-thawing (once) and sonication for a total of 5 min (in bursts of 20 s). The lysate was then centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted to 200 mm of KCl by adding buffer A without KCl and immediately loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed using buffer A at 200 mm KCl and eluted with buffer A containing 500 mm KCl. Purest fractions, selected on the basis of Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, were pooled and, after dilution with buffer A without KCl to a final concentration of 75 mm KCl, applied to an SP-Sepharose column (Pharmacia), followed by washing with buffer B (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 5.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 75 mm KCl and elution by means of a linear salt gradient (75–1,000 mm KCl) in buffer B. Peak fractions were further purified using a Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia) in the same buffer containing 400 mm KCl and subsequently concentrated by means of Centricon spin dialysis tubes (molecular mass cut-off 10 kDa, Amicon). Protein samples at this stage appeared as single bands on silver-stained polyacrylamide gels. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assays (Bio-Rad) employing bovine gammaglobulin as a standard. Deuterated glycine was added to the final samples to an end concentration of 2 m, because this resulted in better long-term stability of the protein at higher temperatures. The oligonucleotide dT18 was purchased from Carl Roth GmbH & Co. The DNA was dissolved in buffer B containing 400 mmKCl and 2 m deuterated glycine to an oligonucleotide concentration of 11 mm. NMR experiments were carried out at 305 K (32 °C) on Bruker AMX500, AMX600, Varian UnityPlus 500, and UnityPlus 750 spectrometers. The protein concentration was 1.5 mm in all experiments. Protein-DNA titrations were carried out by repeated addition of small aliquots of an 11 mm solution of dT18 to a 1.5 mm15N-PC4CTD sample. Formation of the protein-DNA complex was observed through the recording of a 500 MHz1H15N-HSQC spectrum after each addition. 15N-T1 and 15N-T1ρrelaxation and heteronuclear NOE experiments were carried out at 500 MHz as described earlier (15Dayie K.T.

The longitudinal 15N relaxation rates were determined from a series of 7 spectra with delays of 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 768, and 1024 ms. The transverse in-phase 15N relaxation rates (21Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 563-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) were determined from a series of 7 spectra with delays of 8, 16, 32, 48, 64, 96, and 128 ms, using a15N-spin lock with a field strength of 1.4 kHz. Heteronuclear cross relaxation constants were derived from two 500 MHz spectra recorded with and without 2.5 s of saturation of the amide protons. To measure the exchange rate of amide protons, the protein was first lyophilized and then redissolved in D2O, followed by the recording of a series of 1H15N-HSQC spectra, up to 200 h after redissolving the protein. All spectra were processed on Silicon Graphics O2workstations using the software package NMR Pipe (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar). Longitudinal and transversal in-phase relaxation rates and the errors in these parameters were obtained by curve-fitting of a mono-exponential function through the peak intensities according to the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm using in-house developed software, as described by Vis et al. (17Vis H. Vorgias C.E. Wilson K.S. Kaptein R. Boelens R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 265-277Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The 600 MHz 1H15N-HSQC spectrum of PC4CTD is shown in Fig. 1. A nearly complete backbone assignment (listed in TableI) was obtained using double and triple resonance methods, essentially in the manner described by Vis et al. (23Vis H. Mariani M. Vorgias C.E. Wilson K.S. Kaptein R. Boelens R. Q. Magn. Res. Biol. Med. 1995; 2: 107-117Google Scholar). Thus, amide 15N and 1H frequencies were obtained from a high-resolution 600 MHz1H15N-HSQC spectrum, followed by the collection of corresponding intra- and inter-residual Cα and CO connectivities from 600 MHz HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO spectra. This information allowed in most cases for the unique matching of inter-residual Cα and CO connectivities to the intra-residue connectivities of the preceding amide. Peptide fragments identified in this way could then be retrieved in the protein sequence on the basis of characteristic Cα-frequencies (24Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy, Principles and Practice. 1st edition. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar) and, if detectable, side chain resonances obtained from a 750 MHz total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC spectrum. Nearly all Hαfrequencies could also be obtained from this total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC spectrum. Remaining ambiguities in the sequential assignment were resolved using short range NOEs from a 750 MHz NOE spectroscopy-HSQC.Table IPC4CTD backbone assignmentsAmino AcidFree ProteinComplexN (HN)Cα (Hα)CON (HN)Ala126.6 (8.99)52.0 (3.94)172.7126.8 (8.90)Met-63121.0 (8.20)54.7 (5.06)174.6121.0 (8.21)Phe-64121.0 (9.25)56.6 (ND)174.7121.2 (9.28)Gln-65128.2 (9.36)57.7 (ND)176.7128.3 (9.36)Ile-66118.3 (8.34)60.6 (4.50)173.0118.2 (8.35)117.8 (8.20)ND (ND)NDND (ND)117.8 (8.20)ND (ND)NDND (ND)Gly-67106.6 (7.50)44.8 (ND)172.7106.8 (7.54)Lys-68123.9 (8.82)58.9 (ND)NDND (ND)Met-69ND (ND)ND (ND)NDND (ND)Arg-70ND (ND)ND (ND)174.2ND (ND)Tyr-71119.9 (8.81)56.4 (5.21)175.1119.8 (8.89)Val-72121.7 (9.43)60.4 (5.34)175.5121.9 (9.45)Ser-73122.5 (9.59)55.8 (5.40)173.6122.5 (9.67)Val-74124.8 (8.39)61.3 (4.86)175.2124.7 (8.35)Arg-75124.5 (8.56)54.5 (4.66)172.8124.5 (8.61)Asp-76119.6 (8.41)52.6 (5.07)175.6119.5 (8.44)Phe-77126.1 (9.16)56.9 (4.76)174.5126.5 (9.23)Lys-78125.2 (8.94)57.0 (3.63)176.1ND (ND)Gly-79105.9 (8.55)45.4 (3.67/4.14)174.3105.1 (8.40)Lys-80121.3 (7.63)54.4 (4.56)174.8121.6 (7.72)Val-81124.0 (8.22)63.2 (4.29)175.1123.8 (8.15)Leu-82126.4 (8.69)53.4 (4.86)175.0126.1 (8.72)Ile-83123.8 (8.76)61.3 (4.31)174.1ND (ND)Asp-84127.8 (9.22)53.4 (5.33)174.8127.3 (9.24)Ile-85127.1 (8.78)62.0 (4.54)174.8126.9 (8.82)Arg-86127.0 (8.52)55.9 (4.99)173.4127.2 (8.60)Glu-87124.1 (8.13)55.7 (ND)NDND (ND)Tyr-88ND57.2 (ND)173.7ND (ND)Trp-89117.9 (9.26)55.1 (4.96)173.1117.7 (9.18)Met-90119.5 (8.59)53.4 (4.81)175.2118.7 (8.58)Asp-91129.3 (8.59)52.5 (ND)ND128.9 (8.53)Pro-92ND65.3 (ND)177.4ND (ND)Glu-93115.1 (7.92)55.7 (4.29)176.7115.0 (7.90)115.1 (8.00)55.9 (4.29)176.8115.2 (7.97)115.1 (8.06)55.7 (4.29)176.6115.1 (8.04)Gly-94108.4 (8.23)45.6 (3.66/4.09)173.9108.4 (8.27)Glu-95121.0 (8.03)54.7 (4.23)175.1121.1 (8.02)121.1 (8.10)55.2 (4.29)175.6121.1 (8.10)Met-96123.2 (8.38)55.3 (ND)ND123.3 (8.34)122.1 (8.49)55.2 (ND)175.6122.3 (8.56)Lys-97ND (ND)ND (ND)NDND (ND)Pro-98ND (ND)ND (ND)NDND (ND)Gly-99ND (ND)ND (ND)NDND (ND)Arg-100ND (ND)57.3 (ND)177.3ND (ND)Lys-101121.7 (8.41)56.3 (4.52)173.7122.1 (8.50)Gly-102111.5 (7.51)46.3 (3.98/4.16)170.8111.5 (7.55)Ile-103117.5 (8.71)59.9 (4.46)171.2117.3 (8.72)Ser-104122.5 (8.58)56.6 (5.14)173.9122.4 (8.63)Leu-105127.3 (9.41)53.5 (4.70)175.7127.2 (9.34)Asn-106118.7 (7.41)50.8 (5.23)174.3118.2 (7.32)Pro-107ND66.8 (ND)178.8ND (ND)Glu-108119.6 (8.34)60.1 (4.13)179.3119.6 (8.32)Gln-109121.4 (8.37)57.6 (4.50)178.9121.6 (8.42)Trp-110120.3 (8.64)59.4 (ND)177.0120.2 (8.63)Ser-111113.2 (8.30)62.5 (3.79)176.9113.2 (8.30)Gln-112120.0 (7.80)58.9 (3.98)178.4120.1 (7.84)Leu-113122.5 (8.16)59.2 (3.72)178.2122.6 (8.19)Lys-114116.5 (7.83)59.7 (3.40)180.1116.5 (7.81)Glu-115116.9 (7.77)58.2 (3.98)177.7116.8 (7.76)Gln-116115.3 (7.40)55.4 (4.65)175.8115.3 (7.40)Ile-117121.3 (7.28)66.9 (ND)176.7121.2 (7.26)Ser-118113.1 (8.49)62.0 (4.18)176.7113.0 (8.51)Asp-119122.1 (7.37)57.0 (4.29)178.5122.0 (7.35)Ile-120124.1 (8.07)65.5 (ND)177.4124.1 (8.07)Asp-121119.5 (8.75)57.7 (4.34)179.7119.5 (8.76)Asp-122120.1 (7.95)57.4 (4.34)177.6120.1 (7.94)Ala-123121.3 (7.59)54.9 (4.08)180.4121.2 (7.59)Val-124119.0 (8.20)66.3 (3.25)178.3119.3 (8.23)Arg-125117.0 (7.70)58.3 (4.03)177.3117.0 (7.69)Lys-126117.1 (7.24)56.8 (4.18)176.3117.0 (7.24)Leu-127126.1 (7.11)56.8 (4.03)181.9126.2 (7.10)Backbone assignment for PC4CTD (in ppm).

For several residues (Ile-66, Glu-93, Glu-95, and Met-96), multiple sets of signals could be observed. To investigate which parts of PC4CTD are involved in the interaction with ssDNA, a titration was performed with the oligonucleotide dT18. The choice of an 18-mer for our titration was based on earlier experiments that indicated that PC4CTD interacts with approximately 16–20 residues of ssDNA (12Werten S. Langen F.W.M. Van Schaik R. Timmers H.Th.M. Meisterernst M. Van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The complex that forms when the oligonucleotide is added exhibits slow exchange, resulting in a simultaneous decrease in the intensity of the original peaks and increase in the intensity of new signals (data not shown). Nevertheless, assignment of the new signals was in almost all cases straightforward, because the perturbations in the spectrum were relatively modest. Fig.2 A contains a selected region of the superimposed 1H15N-HSQC spectra of the free protein and the 1:1 complex showing resonances that are either not affected (Gln-116), slightly affected (Lys-126), or severely affected (Asn-106) by the addition of the ssDNA. Fig. 2 B lists all perturbations observed. The perturbations are given as Euclidean distances (in Hz) between the peak maxima in the HSQC spectra with and without an equimolar amount of dT18. Although small shifts (around 10 Hz) in peak positions are observed for residues throughout the protein, all perturbations exceeding 20 Hz map to the β-sheet region. Especially large shifts of 30 Hz or more are seen for the outermost parts of β-sheets, β2 and β3, and the loop that connects them (residues Phe-77, Lys-78, Gly-79, Lys-80, and Val-81), the “β-ridge” that separates the two anti-parallel channels (residues Trp-89, Met-90, Asp-91, and Lys-101), and the region that connects sheet β4 to the α-helix (residues Leu-105 and Asn-106). In addition, a surprisingly large perturbation was found for the N-terminal Ala residue, which originates from the expression vector sequence but is located in close proximity to the ends of the anti-parallel channels in the crystal structure. In Fig.3, the perturbations of Fig.2 B are shown in the PC4CTD crystal structure by means of color coding, with colors ranging from green (indicating no perturbation) through white to red (corresponding to a perturbation of 30 Hz or more). As this figure shows, the data support a model in which the ssDNA is held in between the β2β3-arms and the β-ridge of the protein. Consistent with current views concerning protein-ssDNA interactions (25Suck D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we find a large number of positively charged and aromatic residues at the binding surface with their side chains exposed to solution (Lys-68, Arg-70, Tyr-71, Arg-75, Phe-77, Lys-78, Lys-80, Arg-86, Tyr-88, Trp-89, Lys-97, Arg-100, and Lys-101). Interestingly, superposition of one of the PC4 anti-parallel channels onto the ssDNA binding channel found in the RPA-ssDNA cocrystal structure revealed that several of these residues (Arg-75, Phe-77, Arg-86, Tyr-88, Trp-89, and Arg-100) occupy positions with respect to the channel that correspond well to the positions of similar residues in the two RPA subunits (13Brandsen J. Werten S. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. Kroon J. Gros P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). This indicates that PC4 and RPA may have similar ways of contacting ssDNA even though the β-strand topology is markedly different. For residues Tyr-71, Arg-75, Phe-77, Lys-78, Lys-80, Arg-86, Trp-89, and Lys-101, large ssDNA-induced amide resonance perturbations were observed in our titration. We expect these residues to make side chain contacts with the DNA. For Trp-89, involvement in binding has recently been confirmed by mutagenesis (6Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.W.M. Gros P. Timmers H.Th.M. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For residues Lys-68, Arg-70, Tyr-88, Lys-97, and Arg-100, no assignments could be obtained, but the position of these residues with respect to the binding channels strongly suggests that their side chains are also involved in binding. Comparison with other single-stranded DNA-binding proteins suggests a particularly important role in ssDNA binding for the ends of β-strands, β2 and β3, and the loop β2β3 that connects them (residues 77–80). This part of the protein is reminiscent of typical ssDNA-binding loops found in many other single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, like the L45-loop of the OB-fold proteins (26Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). It contains an aromatic residue (Phe-77) and several positively charged residues (Lys-78 and Lys-80, with Arg-75 located nearby in β-strand β2). In the two RPA subunits, the corresponding strands and the connecting loop (β4′β5′) are seen to bind ssDNA through stacking of the aromatic residue Phe-269 (in subunit A) or Phe-386 (subunit B) onto a DNA base, as well as through interactions of the positively charged residue Lys-263 (A) or Arg-382 (B) with the phosphate backbone. The NMR data are in agreement with a similar role of the β2β3-loop of PC4 in ssDNA binding, because the ssDNA-induced amide resonance perturbations of all residues in this region are among the largest observed. The importance of the β4′β5′-loop region for ssDNA binding is further supported by a recent mutagenesis study (6Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.W.M. Gros P. Timmers H.Th.M. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Temperature factors from the crystallographic structure determination of PC4CTD (13Brandsen J. Werten S. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. Kroon J. Gros P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) suggested that the β2β3-loop and the β-ridge exhibit above average mobility. To assess the flexibility of these regions in solution, we carried out relaxation measurements (15N-T1, 15N-T1ρ, and1H15N-NOE) for the backbone amides. Results are shown in Fig. 4. Although15N-T1 did not show significant variation along the protein sequence, 15N-T1ρ values are indeed higher in this region than in the rest of the protein. Considerably lower heteronuclear 1H15N-NOE values were observed in the β2β3-loop and the β-ridge compared with the rest of the molecule. Consistent with these relaxation data, fast hydrogen exchange was observed in both the β2β3-loop and the β-ridge (Fig. 4, lower panel), whereas most of the amides in the core of the protein exhibit either medium or slow exchange. Thus, the regions of PC4 that mediate ssDNA contacts are relatively flexible in solution. Upon formation of the complex with dT18, T1ρ values for amide nitrogens throughout the protein are reduced, most likely because of the larger size of the complex (Fig. 5). However, the reduction of signals from residues in the β2β3-loop region is significantly larger than this uniform decrease in signal intensity. This effect may be caused by attenuation of the higher mobility in this region, which can be understood in terms of stabilization by ssDNA contacts.Figure 515 N-T 1ρ values for the amides in free (gray) and bound PC4CTD (black).The values obtained from curve fitting of peak intensities are shown with error bars indicating single standard deviations. The secondary structure of PC4CTD has been indicated schematically below the graph.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA binding by the two channels as demonstrated here is consistent with and provides support for existing biochemical data in several ways. In the first place, high affinity for heteroduplex structures and the apparent requirement for two juxtaposed single-stranded regions (12Werten S. Langen F.W.M. Van Schaik R. Timmers H.Th.M. Meisterernst M. Van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) are readily explained by the present model: each binding channel can contact one of the strands running in opposite directions, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Moreover, the binding site size (approximately 8 nucleotides in each of the two single-stranded regions) as determined from the affinities for both heteroduplexes and single-stranded oligonucleotides of increasing size (12Werten S. Langen F.W.M. Van Schaik R. Timmers H.Th.M. Meisterernst M. Van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), corresponds closely to what would be expected on the basis of the channel length in the PC4 structure: if it is assumed that ssDNA bound by PC4 is similar in conformation to ssDNA bound by RPA, 8 nucleotides should span a distance of nearly 40 Å, which is also approximately the length of the channels (Fig. 6). The backbone resonances of the residues Met-69, Arg-70, Tyr-88, and Lys-97–Arg-100 of PC4CTD could not be assigned because the corresponding signals were missing in all spectra. Interestingly, several other residues (Glu-93–Met-96) that are in close proximity to the ones that were unassigned give rise to multiple sets of signals, suggesting conformational heterogeneity. Because all of these residues are located in the region of the PC4CTD structure that connects the tips of the β-ridge (which themselves produce well defined nondegenerate resonances) to the core of the protein dimer, it is tempting to speculate that the orientation of the tips with respect to the protein core is ill-defined in solution. Interestingly, the tips contain several negatively charged residues (Asp-91, Glu-93, and Glu-95) that seem to interfere with the interaction of PC4CTDwith an 8-nucleotide heteroduplex in the hypothetical model published earlier (see Ref. 13Brandsen J. Werten S. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. Kroon J. Gros P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and Fig. 6 B), because these charges would be in close proximity to the phosphate backbone of the DNA. However, such DNA molecules are bound with very high affinity (12Werten S. Langen F.W.M. Van Schaik R. Timmers H.Th.M. Meisterernst M. Van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that steric hindrance does not occur. A possible explanation for this is that the tips may be able to adopt alternative conformations in which they have moved “inward” compared with the crystal structure (i.e. toward each other). Such alternative conformations may allow the β-ridge to be inserted into the heteroduplex opening more easily. Conformational heterogeneity would be consistent with the NMR degeneracy that is found for the amino acids in the hinge region and the fact that crystallographic temperature factors for this region are significantly higher than the average for PC4CTD (13Brandsen J. Werten S. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. Kroon J. Gros P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). So far only a single protein (other than the direct homologues of PC4 in various species) has been characterized that contains a region homologous to the PC4 C terminus. This protein, the yeast factor Sub1/Tsp1 (27Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21842-21847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Knaus K. Pollock R. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), is also an RNA polymerase II transcriptional coactivator but differs from PC4 in several important respects. In the first place, Sub1/Tsp1 is much larger than PC4 (33 kDa) and bears no homology to PC4 outside the region corresponding to the PC4 ssDNA-binding domain. Furthermore, the reported mechanisms for coactivation reported for Sub1/Tsp1 (28Knaus K. Pollock R. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and PC4 (4Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3520-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) differ considerably. Nevertheless, the homology between PC4CTD and Sub1/Tsp1(40–105) is very high (73% conserved, 49% identical), suggesting a similar fold and function. Indeed, Sub1/Tsp1 has been reported to bind to ssDNA (27Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21842-21847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The fact that two otherwise quite different transcriptional cofactors both contain this type of ssDNA binding domain suggests that interaction with ssDNA or heteroduplexes is part of a general mechanism that helps regulate transcription in eukaryotes. Indeed, direct evidence for a role of ssDNA binding by PC4 in regulation of transcription was recently provided (6Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.W.M. Gros P. Timmers H.Th.M. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The identification of DNA-contacting residues described here and the construction of point mutants that do not interact with ssDNA (6Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.W.M. Gros P. Timmers H.Th.M. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) will be helpful in the further elucidation of the precise role of the PC4 C-terminal domain and the homologous domain in Sub1/Tsp1, in transcription and other processes.

Calcium ion (Ca2+) is a universally employed cytosolic messenger in eukaryotic cells. It is involved in many cellular processes such as signal transduction, contraction, secretion, and cell proliferation (1Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar, 2Siesjö B.K. Wieloch T. Adv. Neurol. 1986; 44: 813-847PubMed Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, Ca2+plays a major role in the activities and functions of neuronal cells (3Rubin R.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1970; 22: 389-428PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rasmussen H.

One of the most widely recognized roles of Ca2+ in synaptic function is its action in neurotransmission. Studies on the effects of Ca2+ on neurotransmitter release, synaptic protein phosphorylation, synaptic vesicles, and synaptic membrane interactions have provided experimental evidence that Ca2+regulates several biochemical and morphological events in synaptic preparations (6Delorenzo R.J.

Cell Calcium. 1981; 2: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In many cases, the effects of Ca2+ are mediated by the Ca2+-binding proteins (8Davis T.N.

The EF-hand proteins are characterized by single or multiple pairs of a common helix-loop-helix motif that coordinates Ca2+ (9Kretsinger R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 239-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 10Kawasaki H. Kretsinger R.H. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 343-517PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, CaM, 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; CaM-kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. troponin C, and myosin light chain have four EF-hand motifs/molecule, whereas S100 proteins have only two motifs per molecule. In addition to the role as a Ca2+-buffering system, the binding of Ca2+causes a conformational change of EF-hand proteins and enables them to interact with their target proteins. Most of the EF-hand proteins except CaM show specific tissue distribution, suggesting their particular functions in each tissue. CaM has broad distribution within the cell and throughout different tissues and is a multifunctional regulatory protein that, in a Ca2+-dependent manner, activates a number of enzymes that are involved in a variety of physiological processes (11Vanaman T.C. Cheung W.Y. Calcium and Cell Function. 1. Academic Press Inc., New York1980: 41-58Google Scholar). Among these enzymes, CaM-kinase II is one of the most abundant Ca2+-activated protein kinases in the brain, and it plays important roles in a variety of neural functions including receptor function, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic plasticity (12GuptaRoy B. Beckingham K. Griffith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19846-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CaM-kinase II is activated by binding to the Ca2+-bound form of CaM, which dramatically increases the affinity of the enzyme for Mg2+/ATP, thus leading to substrate phosphorylation and autophosphorylation (13Shields S.M. Vernon P.J. Kelly P.T. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 1599-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 15Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). This self-regulation system coupled to Ca2+/CaM-dependent autophosphorylation may be involved in important physiological roles responding to transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (16Hagiwara T. Ohsako S. Yamauchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16401-16408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During autophosphorylation (of Thr286), trapping of CaM in CaM-kinase II occurs, resulting in prolongation of the activation period of CaM-kinase II. This process is understood as a good model of memory formation (15Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 17Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we cloned and characterized a novel two EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein, termed calbrain, that is brain-specific and highly expressed in the hippocampus. To characterize the physiological function of this protein in the hippocampus, the effects of calbrain on CaM-kinase II were examined. The results revealed that calbrain competitively inhibited the activity of CaM-kinase II, suggesting that calbrain may be involved in neuronal signal transduction and memory. Degenerate primers were originally designed from transmembrane regions of several mammalian G-protein-coupled receptors. Polymerase chain reaction was performed with these primers using 100 ng of human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) as a template. The cycling condition was 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 0.5 min at 72 °C for 37 cycles. The polymerase chain reaction products were end-repaired with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated into pCR-Script SK(+) vector (Stratagene). Samples were transformed, and colonies were picked for subsequent sequencing. The sequence data was obtained using ABI 373 sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) with dye-terminators by the method of Sanger et al. (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). The data was searched against SWISSPROT (Ver.30.0) data base by BLAST algorithm (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). The fragment that showed a similarity to Ca2+-binding proteins was chosen for further analysis. About one million recombinants of human brain λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) were grown and transferred onto nylon membranes. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used as a probe for the screening. Hybridization-positive plaques were picked and grown to purify the DNA. Inserts from those positive clones were subcloned into EcoRI cloning site of pBluescript KS (+) vector (Stratagene). The sequence was determined, and data was searched as above. The full-length coding region of calbrain was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used as a probe for Northern hybridization analysis. A human multiple tissue Northern blot filter (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg of poly(A)+RNA in each lane was prehybridized in a solution containing 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 10× Denhardt's, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide, and 2% SDS for 3 h at 42 °C. The blot was then hybridized in the same solution with the labeled probe at 42 °C for 20 h. The blot was washed several times with a mixture of 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.05% SDS for 30 min at room temperature and then once with a mixture of 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 40 min at 50 °C. The filter was exposed to Fuji BASIII imaging plates (Fuji Biomedical, Japan), and the image was analyzed by the BAS 1000 phosphor-imaging system (Fuji Biomedical, Japan). Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (all male, 8–9 weeks old) were anesthetized, and brains were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline. Brains were then quickly removed and frozen at-80 °C. Cryostat sections (10 μm-thickness) were mounted onto slides. The sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 0.01% proteinase K in Tris-HCl for 30 min, and then acetylated for 15 min with 0.2m triethanolamine containing 0.2% acetic acid. After sequential dehydration through a graded alcohol series, each section was hybridized either with a digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe or with a labeled sense probe as a control. The RNA probe was made from a rat homologue of calbrain gene that is 99.0% identical in nucleotide level to the human one. After hybridization at 50 °C overnight, the slides were incubated with RNase A (10 μg/ml) and washed with 2× SSC and then with 0.2× SSC. Slides were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min, washed, and developed by incubating at 4 °C overnight with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP)/nitro blue tetrazolium. Recombinant calbrain protein was expressed using the QIA expressionist system (QIAGEN). The gene construct encoding calbrain was subcloned into pQE expression plasmid vector and transformed intoEscherichia coli host strain M15. Transformed M15 cells were cultured in 500 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin until the A 600 of 0.7 at 37 °C. After adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactropyanoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, the cells were incubated for another 5 h. As a negative control, a plasmid vector with no insert was transformed and expressed in the same way. The cells were harvested and lysed with 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme before sonication. After removal of cellular debris, the supernatant was collected, and histidine-tagged calbrain protein was purified on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resin in a batch procedure. The protein-resin complex was set into a column and washed with washing buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 5.7. After washing, the protein was eluted with 0.1–0.5m imidazole gradient in washing buffer. Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tricine-SDS-PAGE) was carried out as described previously (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71457) Google Scholar). Protein samples, CaM protein as a control, and molecular weight markers were denatured and applied to 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Separated protein bands were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by the method of Kyhse-Andersen (20Schägger H. von Jago W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 199: 223-231Crossref Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). The calcium binding study using45Ca2+ was performed according to the method of Maruyama et al. (21Kyhase-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the protein transfer, the membrane was soaked in a solution containing 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8). The membrane was then incubated in the same buffer containing 1 mCi/liter 45CaCl2 for 10 min. Nonspecifically bound 45Ca2+ was removed by washing with 50% ethanol for 5 min, and dried membrane was exposed to imaging plates. The images were analyzed by Fuji phosphor-imaging system as above, under the Northern hybridization analysis. Ca2+ binding affinity of recombinant calbrain was determined by equilibrium dialysis. Calbrain was first dialyzed overnight against 1000 volumes of a solution containing 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EGTA to remove bound Ca2+ from the protein. The dialyzed protein was then used for equilibrium dialysis as follows. A 0.5-ml portion of protein at the concentration of 1 mg/ml was dialyzed with shaking for 48 h at 4 °C against 100 ml of the same solution as described above for Ca2+ binding affinity but containing various amounts of CaCl2 and45Ca2+ (5 μCi) to achieve the desired free-Ca2+ concentration. The solutions outside and inside the dialysis tubing were removed, the absorbance at 278 nm was determined, and the protein concentration calculated ( A2781% = 0.958). Samples of these solutions were subjected to liquid scintillation spectrometry. The association constants for metal and H+ binding to EGTA were based on values measured by Fabiato (23Fabiato A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 457-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The activity of CaM-kinase II was assayed by measuring the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation (32P incorporation) of syntide-2 substrate as described previously by Ochiishi et al. (24Ochiishi T. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Brain Res. 1993; 610: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP, 8 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 20 μmsyntide-2, 0.25 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mmEGTA, 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, and 0.3 μg/ml CaM-kinase II (purified from bovine brain, kindly provided by Dr. Yamauchi (25Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 116: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)). A range of CaM or recombinant calbrain (0–200 nm) was employed in the assay mixture at the total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 1 min and stopped by spotting onto P81 filter paper. The filter papers were washed several times with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. An inhibition assay of Ca2+-dependent activity of CaM-kinase II was performed in the standard mixture as described above in the presence of various concentrations of CaM. Autophosphorylation of CaM-kinase II was assayed in the standard mixture at the total volume of 60 μl. The reactions were carried out at 0 °C for 10 min as described previously (26Yoshimura Y. Yamauchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26354-26359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), then samples were boiled for 3 min and were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the band of CaM-kinase II protein was excised from the gel. Radioactivity of the gel was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. The effect of calbrain on CaM binding to CaM-kinase II was examined as described previously (27Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Setton B.M. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 274-283Google Scholar) with some modifications. The reaction mixture for the binding studies was the same as that used in the kinase activity assay without ATP. Various concentrations (0–200 μm) of 125I-CaM and calbrain were incubated in the reaction mixture at the total volume of 200 μl at 4 °C for 1 h, and they were reacted with 3 μg of polyclonal anti-CaM-kinase II antibody (Transduction Laboratories) at 4 °C for 16 h. The amount of antibody was proved to be adequate for binding to entire CaM-kinase II in the reaction mixture. Then, 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each reaction mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotating wheel. After 3 washes with the reaction mixture without CaM-kinase II, these samples were centrifuged (5000 rpm, 5 min), and the radioactivity of each pellet was measured by a gamma counter. Double-reciprocal plots and determination of K i values were performed as described by Segel (28Segel I.H. Bergmeyer H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). The isolated clone was found to have a 210-nucleotide open reading frame that encodes a 70-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 8.06 kDa (Fig.1). We named the clone as calbrain. A motif search suggested the presence of two EF-hands, a motif known to be involved in calcium binding (29Kretsinger R.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 8: 119-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). By a data base search, calbrain showed significant high homology to CaM and troponin C proteins. The four EF-hand domains of CaM, troponin C, and two EF-hand domains of S100β protein and calbrain were aligned, and the amino acid sequences were compared as shown in Fig. 2. The first domain of calbrain is highly (50.0% each) homologous to the first and the third domain of CaM. The second domain of calbrain is homologous to the second and the fourth domains of CaM (48.1 and 51.9%, respectively) and those of troponin C (51.9% each). The first and the second domains of calbrain showed only 29.6% homology. Although calbrain has only two EF-hand motifs, the similarity between calbrain and two EF-hand protein (S100β) is very low (Fig. 2).Figure 2Alignment of the amino acid sequences of EF-hand domains. The first and second EF-hand domains of calbrain (CALBR1 and CALBR2) and S100β (S100B1 and S100B2) and the first, second, third, and fourth domain of CaM and troponin C (CALM1 to CALM4, TROPO1 to TROPO4, respectively) were aligned. The conserved amino acid residues are shown in shaded boxes. The lineswith arrows indicate the helix and loop region of EF-hand. The numbers on the right indicate the percentages of similarity between either CALBR1 or CALBR2 and EF-domains in each protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From the results of Northern hybridization analysis under high stringency conditions, an approximate 1.5-kilobase single calbrain transcript was detected exclusively in the brain (Fig.3). No band was detected in other tissues examined including heart, placenta, lung, liver, muscle, kidney, and pancreas. Results ofin situ hybridization study for localization of calbrain mRNA in rat brain was conducted on rat brain sections showed strong signals in the pyramidal layers CA1 to CA3 of the hippocampal gyrus and the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus (Fig.4). The habenular nucleus in the epithalamus was also stained strongly. In the cerebellum, the Purkinje cells were strongly stained. There were also weak and scattering signals in the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain. No staining was observed when a sense probe was used as a control. The purified calbrain and CaM as a control were run on a 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel with molecular mass markers (Fig.5 A). The molecular mass based on the amino acid sequence of mammalian CaM is 16.7 kDa, which is approximately double the size of calbrain. On Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel, calbrain protein was observed at approximately 8 kDa, and CaM is observed as the same size of its molecular mass. The control fraction (sample using the nonrecombinant vector) on the same Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel did not show any protein bands. The 45Ca2+binding study of calbrain are shown in Fig. 5 A. Both CaM and calbrain showed strong radioactive bands at the expected positions, indicating the binding of 45Ca2+ to these proteins. Fig. 5 B shows a saturation curve for the Ca2+ binding to calbrain. Scatchard analysis (30Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) of the data (Fig. 5 B, inset and legend) reveals that, in the presence of 3.0 mm MgCl2 and 150 mm KCl, calbrain binds 2.0 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein with an apparent K d of 0.194 μm. The effect of calbrain on CaM-kinase II activity is shown in Fig.6, A and B. The activity of CaM-kinase II incubated in the solution containing 0–200 μm calbrain without CaM (Fig. 6 A, open circles) revealed that calbrain was not able to activate CaM-kinase II. On the other hand, Fig. 6 B showed that calbrain competitively inhibited activation of CaM-kinase II by CaM with a K i value of 143.5 ± 16.4 nm(mean ±S.E.). The effect of calbrain on the autophosphorylation of CaM-kinase II was examined, and the results were shown in Fig.7. Calbrain also competitively inhibited CaM-dependent autophosphorylation of CaM-kinase II with aK i value of 189.7 ± 12.4 nm (mean ±S.E.), whereas calbrain itself did not induce autophosphorylation of CaM-kinase II (data not shown). The binding study of CaM and calbrain to CaM-kinase II revealed that calbrain competitively inhibited CaM binding to CaM-kinase II, and the K i value of this inhibition was 128.6 ± 19.7 nm (mean ±S.E.) (Fig.8).Figure 7Inhibition of CaM-kinase II autophosphorylation by calbrain. The autophosphorylation of purified bovine CaM-kinase II in the presence of indicated concentrations of calbrain and varying concentrations of CaM was assessed by measuring [γ-32P]ATP radioactivity of CaM-kinase II extracted from electrophoresed gels. Autophosphorylation assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1/v represents 1/autophosphorylation of CaM-kinase II (%).

CaM-kinase II was immunoprecipitated by anti-CaM-kinase II antibody after the reaction, and the radioactivity of each sample was measured. The radioactivity of the bound125I-CaM in the presence of 500 nm CaM and 0 nm calbrain was measured and designated as 100%.

The first EF-hand motif of calbrain is very similar to the first and the third motifs, and the second EF-hand motif of calbrain very similar to the second and the fourth motifs of CaM and troponin C. Although calbrain is a two EF-hand protein, the homology between calbrain and two EF-hand proteins such as S100β was found to be very low. From the high sequence homology between EF-hand motifs, it has been proposed that CaM, troponin C, and myosin light chain gene evolved from a common four-domain molecule (22.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar,31Goodman M. Pechère J.F. Haiech J. Demaille J.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1979; 13: 331-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 32Fischer R. Koller M. Flura Mathews S. Strehler-Page M.A. Krebs J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17055-17062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each of these proteins, the first and the third and the second and fourth EF-hand domains show high homology, supporting the hypothesis that these proteins evolved from a two-domain precursor by gene duplication (33Perret C. J. Mol. Evol. 1988; 27: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Parmentier M. Lawson D.E.M. Vassart G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The significant homology between the EF-hand motifs of calbrain and CaM family suggests that although calbrain is a two EF-hand protein, evolutionally it is related closely to the CaM family rather than two EF-hand protein families. As calbrain is the first two EF-hand protein whose domains appear to be very similar to those of four EF-hand proteins, our findings may be interesting from the aspect of the evolution of EF-hand proteins. The biological functions of EF-hand proteins are strongly related to the conformational changes of EF-hand domains in response to Ca2+ binding. EF-hand domains that show large conformational changes by binding Ca2+ are known to have a trigger function in the activation of target proteins. The domains that have regulatory roles are termed regulatory domains (35Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and proteins that have such domain(s) are called Ca2+ sensor proteins. For example, CaM and troponin C, which are classified in this category, enable the cell to detect a stimulatory influx of Ca2+ and thereby transduce this signal into a variety of cellular processes (37deSilva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. de Silva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements. Oxford University Press, London1991: 268-298Google Scholar). On the other hand, EF-hand domains that exhibit small conformational changes are termed structural or buffer domains (36Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 38Baimbridge K.G. Miller J.J. Parkes C.O. Brain Res. 1982; 239: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). These domains are responsible for the structural stability, local Ca2+ transport, and function in buffering intracellular Ca2+. Proteins possessing these domains, such as calbindin and parvalbumin, are called Ca2+ buffer proteins (39Mattson M.P. Rychlik B. Chu C. Christakos S. Neuron. 1991; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 40Kosaka T. Kosaka K. Nakayama T. Hunziker W. Heizmann C.W. Exp. Brain Res. 1993; 93: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). From the amino acid sequence in the present study, it is difficult to predict whether calbrain has regulatory or structural domains, and therefore is a Ca2+ sensor or Ca2+ buffer protein. It has been suggested that the interhelical angle changes of EF-hand proteins upon Ca2+binding become a good index for their classification. Another useful method is to check whether or not the protein can bind to a hydrophobic column in a Ca2+-dependent manner (36Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Ca2+ sensor proteins that cause large conformational changes bind to the column by Ca2+-induced exposure of the hydrophobic surface in the protein formed by a pair of EF-hands. After that, these proteins can be eluted by removing Ca2+ with EGTA. This method was successfully applied for the purification of CaM (41Gophalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). We have purified the recombinant calbrain protein by this method, also (data not shown), and the results indicate that calbrain possesses a regulatory domain that shows a large conformational change with Ca2+ binding and, therefore, can be classified as a Ca2+ sensor protein. The distribution study of calbrain mRNA revealed that calbrain is a brain-specific Ca2+-binding protein that is expressed abundantly in the hippocampus, in the habenular nucleus of the epithalamus and in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum. The specific tissue distribution of EF-hand proteins has suggested their particular functions in each tissue (42Braun K. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 21: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 43Baimbridge K.G. Celio M.R. Rogers J.H.

Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 271: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The localization of calbrain mRNA in the hippocampus and cerebellum, together with its functional potency as a Ca2+ sensor protein being involved in the Ca2+ signal transduction suggest an important role for this protein in the central nervous system. A number of studies on hippocampus have shown that this part of the brain is particularly involved in acquisition and storage of spatial information (45McNaughton B.L. Morris R.G.M. Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 408-415Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 46Morris R.G.M. Garrud P. Rawlins J.N.P. O'Keefe J.

CaM-kinase II is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase capable of phosphorylating several endogenous proteins in the brain (48Cheung W.Y.

Many biochemical studies have indicated that phosphorylation induced by CaM-kinase II can act as a molecular switch, conferring properties that are advantageous for long-lasting storage of changes initiated by brief Ca2+ signals (57Lisman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3055-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 58Lisman J.E.

The binding study of CaM and calbrain to CaM-kinase II indicated that under nonautophosphorylated conditions, calbrain inhibited CaM binding to CaM-kinase II competitively (Fig. 8). Although calbrain could not activate CaM-kinase II, Fig. 6 B showed that calbrain competitively inhibited the activation of CaM-kinase II by CaM. Because K ivalues of binding and activity inhibition were similar, it was supposed that inhibition of CaM binding by calbrain may caused the reduction of kinase activity. CaM-kinase II activity is regulated by Ca2+/CaM and autophosphorylation (60Colbran R.J. Fong Y.L. Schworer C.M. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18145-18151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When CaM binds to the CaM binding domain, a conformational change is induced in the regulatory region, and the interaction of inhibitory domain with the active site is disrupted. It allows the active site to become accessible to exogenous substrate. When Ca2+/CaM is bound, CaM-kinase II is rapidly autophosphorylated on Thr286, and autophosphorylation increases CaM binding affinity to the kinase dramatically by decreasing of CaM-releasing time (61Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Under both experimental conditions used for the kinase activity assay (incubation at 30 °C for 1 min) and autophosphorylation assay (at 0 °C for 10 min), autophosphorylation on Thr286 of CaM-bound kinase occurs (24Ochiishi T. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Brain Res. 1993; 610: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 116: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Yoshimura Y. Yamauchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26354-26359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity detected in Fig. 6 Bmay be influenced by a change of CaM affinity caused by autophosphorylation. K i values of kinase activity (143.5 ± 16.4 nm) and autophosphorylation (189.7 ± 12.4 nm) did not significantly differ from that of CaM binding (128.6 ± 19.7 nm) under nonautophosphorylated condition. This is the first report of a novel Ca2+-binding protein that can inhibit CaM-dependent CaM-kinase II activity. Although calbrain can reduce autophosphorylation, it is supposed that this protein is involved in the physiological regulation of CaM-kinase II. As CaM-kinase II has multiple functions and essential roles in the brain, calbrain may also play important roles in the central nerve system. We thank Dr. T. Yamauchi for providing CaM-kinase II. We are also grateful to Dr. T. Yamauchi, Dr. S. Kimura, and Dr. N. A. Janjua for preparation of the manuscript and the figures."
https://openalex.org/W2020475407,"We have examined the effect of protein kinase C (PKC) on the expression of the E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNAs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The lower classic PKC activity on pretreatment with phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)) for 24 h markedly decreased IL-1β-induced E-selectin mRNA expression in the presence of fetal calf serum and basic fibroblast growth factor, although the induction of ICAM-1 mRNA expression was only influenced a little by the PKC down-regulation. On the other hand, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced gene expression of these adhesion molecules was unaffected by such PKC modulation. The intracellular signals generated by interleukin (IL)-1β and TNFα themselves are not mediated through classic PKC activation, because the response to neither stimulant was inhibited by the PKC down-regulation in the absence of fetal calf serum and basic fibroblast growth factor. Simultaneous treatment with IL-1β and PMA synergistically induced E-selectin gene expression but not when TNFα was substituted for IL-1β. ICAM-1 mRNA expression was only additively induced on the cotreatment. The synergistic effect on E-selectin mRNA induction was independent of de novo protein synthesis and mediated by elevated transcriptional activity. Promoter analysis of E-selectin indicated that the NF-ELAM1/activating transcription factor element is critical for the synergistic effect of the cotreatment with IL-1β and PMA.

Indeed, there has been an explosion of interest in these topics, which has been fueled by remarkable advances in new therapies directed at several adhesion molecules (reviewed in Ref. 8Carlos T.M. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 2068-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these molecules are inducible and regulated through gene expression. Regulation of adhesion molecule expression has been largely studied in vitro using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), in which two monokines, IL-1 and TNFα, can induce these adhesion molecules in the same manner through NF-κB activation (9Voraberger G. Schafer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2777-2786PubMed Google Scholar, 10Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Collins T. J. Exp.

However, a study involving dermal microvascular endothelial cells has shown that ICAM-1 is induced by either IL-1 or TNFα, whereas VCAM-1 is induced only by TNFα (12Swerlick R.A. Lee K.H. Li L.J. Sepp N.T. Caughman S.W. Lawley T.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 698-705PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the signals generated by IL-1 and TNFα for adhesion molecule induction are different in part. We have examined whether or not there is such tissue-specific regulatory control of the gene expression of adhesion moleculesin vivo, since the expression of chemokine mRNAs following systemic treatment with proinflammatory cytokines was induced in a tissue-specific manner in mice (13Narumi S. Wyner L.M. Stoler M.H. Tannenbaum C.S. Hamilton T.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 52: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Ohmori Y. Wyner L. Narumi S. Armstrong D. Stoler M. Hamilton T.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we found that E-selectin mRNA expression following systemic treatment with IL-1β was induced in the heart in a tissue-specific manner and that IL-1β was a much stronger inducer of E-selectin mRNA than TNFα, while ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were induced similarly by either IL-1β or TNFα (15Tamaru M. Tomura K. Sakamoto S. Tezuka K. Tamatani T. Narumi S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1292-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We assumed the presence of heart-specific microenvironments as one reason. There are many stimuli that affect cells in various tissues, including localized cytokines, growth factors, and specific extracellular matrices. Although the intracellular signals elicited by them remain to be elucidated, some of them would induce the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (16Farrar W.L. Thomas T.P. Anderson W.B.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C1090-C1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since E-selectin mRNA expression is also induced by treatments that activate PKC (22Ritchie A.J. Johnson D.R. Ewenstein B.M. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3056-3062PubMed Google Scholar), we have examined the cooperative effect of PKC activation on IL-1β- or TNFα-induced gene expression of E-selectin. Our results indicate that although the intracellular signals generated by IL-1β and TNFα themselves are not mediated through classic PKC activation, the coexistence of activated classic PKC and signals elicited by IL-1β, but not TNFα, synergistically induces the expression of E-selectin mRNA via increased transcription. Furthermore, promoter analysis of the E-selectin gene suggests that NF-ELAM1/activating transcription factor (ATF) element is indispensable for the synergistic transcription of E-selectin induced by the combined treatment with IL-1β and PMA.

(Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals were obtained from Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). HUVEC were isolated from human umbilical cords using a perfusate obtained with trypsin (Life Technologies). HUVEC were serially passaged (in a 1:5 split ratio) and maintained in medium 199 containing 10% FCS, antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin) and 10 ng/ml human recombinant bFGF. HUVEC were usually precultured in medium 199 supplemented with 0.5% FCS and antibiotics for 24 h before experiments. Tissue culture dishes were precoated with collagen type 4. HUVEC at the sixth to eighth passage were used for experiments. The plasmids encoding the genes for human ICAM-1 and E-selectin were purchased from British Biotechnology Ltd. (Oxford, United Kingdom). For Northern hybridization, plasmid DNA (1 mg) was radiolabeled by nick translation with [32P]dCTP to a specific activity of approximately 108 cpm/mg and was used at 7 × 106 cpm/blot. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the NF-ELAM1/ATF cis-element (−166 to −129) (5′-GAGACAGAGTTTCTGACATCATTGTAATTTTAAGCATC-3′), the oligonucleotides that introduced the mutations in the NF-ELAM1/ATF cis-element (5′-GAGACAGAGTTTCgtcgAgCcTTGTAATTTTAAGCATC-3′), the distal two κB consensus sequences (−128 to −101) (5′-GTGGATATTCCCGGGAAAGTTTTTGGAT-3′), or the proximal κB site (−100 to −75) (5′-GCCATTGGGGATTTCCTCTTTACTGG-3′) in the E-selectin promoter region were synthesized. The oligonucleotides (10 pmol) were radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P] ATP to a specific activity of over 106 cpm/pmol. Total RNA was isolated from confluent HUVEC using guanidine isothiocyanate cesium chloride according to the previously published method (23Chirgwin J.M. Pryzbyla R.J. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA (20 μg) were denatured and subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel as described previously (24Perbal B. A Practical Guide to Molecular Cloning. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar, 25Thomas P.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The RNA was then blotted by capillary transfer onto nylon membranes (Boehringer Mannheim Yamanouchi). The blots were prehybridized for 6 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution (0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 0.25 mg/ml denatured herring testes DNA and 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 12–18 h with 7 × 106 cpm of the denatured probe. The filters were washed for 30 min at room temperature in 0.1% SDS, 2× SSC and then for 15–30 min at 55 °C in the same solution. The blots were then exposed to XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with DuPont Cronex Lightening Plus intensifying screens at −70 °C. In some experiments, the blots were reutilized by stripping and rehybridization with different probes. Expression of β-actin was used as an internal control and was applied in all experiments. In addition, the RNA load per lane was assessed by ethidium bromide staining of the original agarose gel after capillary transfer. In some experiments, the autoradiograms were quantified by videodensitometry, and the levels of mRNA were normalized relative to those of β-actin. HUVEC were treated as indicated in the text, and nuclei were isolated as described previously (26Groudine M. Peretz M. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Transcription that started in intact cells was allowed to reach completion in the presence of [α-32P]UTP, and then the RNA was isolated and hybridized to slot-blotted plasmids containing specific cDNA inserts (5 μg of DNA/slot) essentially as described elsewhere (27Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar, 28Introna M. Bast Jr., R.C. Johnston P.A. Adams D.O. Hamilton T.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The blots were autoradiographed for 24–72 h at −70 °C as described above. The autoradiograms were quantified by videodensitometry, and the levels of transcripts were normalized relative to those of β-actin. The wild-type fragment (−800 to +50) of the human E-selectin promoter was generated by polymerase chain reaction using two gene-specific primers and HUVEC genomic DNA as the template. The two primers carried base pair substitutions that introduced a BglII site at the 5′-end of the fragment (BglII (−800) primer, 5′-GCGAAGATCTGAGATGGCGTTTCTCCATGT-3′) and aHindIII site at the 3′-end (HindIII primer, 5′-AGAGAAGCTTTGTCTCAGGTCAGTATAGGA-3′). The resulting fragment was cloned into the BglII and HindIII sites of the luciferase expression vector, PicaGene Basic Vector (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan). The 5′-flanking restriction sites, SspI,AccI, NsiI, and SmaI, were used to generate −554, −382, −232, and −116 chimeras, respectively. Deletion mutants with end points at −166 and −129 were generated using the HindIII primer, and the BglII (−166) primer (5′-GCGAAGATCTGAGACAGAGTTTCTGACATCATTG-3′) and BglII (−129) primer (5′-GCGAAGATCTCGTGGATATTCCCGGGAAAGT-3′), respectively. A mutant that introduced the mutations in the NF-ELAM1/ATF cis-element, mNF-ELAM1/ATF, was generated using the HindIII primer and the BglII (−166m) primer (5′-GCGAAGATCTGAGACAGAGTTTCgtcgAgCcTTG-3′). The resulting fragments were also cloned into the PicaGene Basic Vector. The 4× NF-ELAM1/ATF construct was made as follows. The double-stranded oligonucleotide carrying a XhoI site at the 5′-end and aBglII site at the 3′-end (5′-TCGAGTTTCTGACATCATTTTCTGACATCATTTTCTGACATCATTTTCTGACATCATA-3′) was inserted into the XhoI/BglII sites of the PicaGene Promoter Vector (Toyo Ink), which only contains the SV40 virus minimal promoter. HUVEC were plated onto six-well collagen-coated culture dishes (2 × 105cells/well) 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection was performed with Lipofectin (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, reporter DNA (20 μg) was mixed with 2 μl of Lipofectin and up to 200 μl of serum-free medium (Opti-MEM; Life Technologies). After a 30-min incubation, further Opti-MEM (800 μl) was added, and the mixture was applied to cells that had been washed twice with Opti-MEM. Four hours later, the medium was changed to medium 199 containing 10% FCS and 10 ng/ml bFGF. After a 24-h culture, the medium was changed to medium 199 containing only 0.5% FCS, followed by culture for a further 24 h. After the indicated treatment for 6 h, the cells were harvested. The cells were lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (Toyo Ink), and 20 μl of the resultant extract was used for the luciferase assay (Toyo Ink). The luciferase activities were normalized relative to total protein concentrations of the cell extracts. Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the procedure of Dignam et al.(29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off, and then harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended and then incubated on ice for 15 min in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then vortexed for 10 s with 0.6% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were separated from the cytosol by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 60 s and then resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and shaken for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. Protein concentrations were measured by means of the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For the binding reaction, nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) were incubated in a total reaction mixture of 25 μl comprising 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, and 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amershan Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The radiolabeled oligonucleotide (105 cpm) was added to the mixture after preincubation for 15 min at 4 °C, and then the total reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For antibody “supershift” analysis, 2 μg each of the indicated antibodies was added, followed preincubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were loaded on 6% polyacrylamide gels in low ionic strength buffer (25 mm Tris, 22.5 mm borate, and 0.25 mm EDTA) and run at 15 V/cm with cooling. The gels were then dried and analyzed by autoradiography. UV cross-linking was performed as described previously (30Narumi S. Tebo J.M. Finke J.H. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 529-534PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 80 mg of nuclear extract was incubated in a 100-μl total reaction mixture comprising 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 80 mm NaCl, and 20 μg of poly(dI-dC). The radiolabeled bromodeoxyuridine-substituted oligonucleotide (8 × 105 cpm) was then added to the reaction mixture. The preincubation and incubation times were as described above. The reaction mixture was then subjected to electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel. After separation, the gel was placed in contact with the filter surface of a 302-nm UV transilluminator and irradiated for 10 min. The optimal exposure conditions for cross-linking were determined experimentally. The gel was then autoradiographed for 30 min. The region corresponding to the specific protein-DNA complex was located by inspection and excised. To each slice, 500 μl of a mixture comprising 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol was added, followed by equilibration for 40 min. The gel slices were then loaded onto 1.5-mm-thick 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained, dried under vacuum, and then subjected to autoradiography. Initially, we wished to determine if classic PKC activation was involved in the intracellular signaling pathway through which IL-1β or TNFα induces E-selectin mRNA in HUVEC, since the PKC dependence of IL-1β or TNFα-induced E-selectin mRNA expression has not been well defined (31Montgomery K.F. Osborn L. Hession C. Tizard R. Goff D. Vassallo C. Tarr P.I. Bomsztyk K. Lobb R. Harlan J.M. Pohlman T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6523-6527Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). One reason for the discrepancy is that available PKC inhibitors such as H7 are not strictly specific for that kinase (32Hidaka H.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar), and another reason is whether or not the culture medium during the period of HUVEC stimulation includes FCS and bFGF, which can activate classic PKC. Therefore, we examined the effect of PKC down-regulation, due to pretreatment with PMA, on the gene expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1 induced by IL-1β or TNFα in the presence or absence of FCS and bFGF. HUVEC were precultured for 24 h with PMA (1 μg/ml) in medium 199 containing 10% FCS and 10 ng/ml of bFGF or containing only 0.5% FCS. Then the HUVEC were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and stimulated with IL-1β (400 pg/ml) or TNFα (500 pg/ml) for 3 h. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern hybridization as to the specific mRNA content using radiolabeled probes for the E-selectin, ICAM-1, and β-actin genes (Fig. 1). In the presence of FCS/bFGF, IL-1β-induced E-selectin mRNA expression was strongly decreased after a 24-h pretreatment with PMA, whereas ICAM-1 mRNA induction was decreased only a little by such PKC down-regulation. Interestingly, TNFα-induced gene expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1 was unaffected by the classic PKC down-regulation. In contrast, in the absence of FCS/bFGF, pretreatment with PMA did not affect the inducibility of these genes upon treatment with either IL-1β or TNFα. These data demonstrate that PKC-mediated pathways are not involved in the intracellular signaling pathways through which IL-1β or TNFα induces gene expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1 and that classic PKC activation by FCS/bFGF and IL-1β (but not TNFα) cooperatively affects the selective induction of E-selectin mRNA expression in HUVEC. To determine whether or not activated PKC synergizes with IL-1β, but not with TNFα, to induce E-selectin mRNA expression, HUVEC were treated with IL-1β or TNFα, either alone or in combination with PMA (100 ng/ml), in medium 199 containing only 0.5% FCS, without bFGF. Following autoradiography, the expression levels of E-selectin and ICAM-1 mRNA were normalized relative to that of β-actin (Fig.2). Treatment with IL-1β, TNFα, or PMA stimulated equivalent gene expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1. The combined treatment with IL-1β and PMA synergistically induced E-selectin mRNA expression, although the cotreatment had only an additive effect on the induction of ICAM-1 mRNA. In contrast, when TNFα was substituted for IL-1β, the cotreatment with PMA had no synergistic effect on the gene expression of E-selectin or ICAM-1. These data demonstrate that classic PKC activation and the IL-1β-induced intracellular signaling pathway, which differs from the TNFα-induced one, are necessary for full induction of E-selectin mRNA. To confirm the markedly different effects of IL-1β and TNFα on E-selectin mRNA expression in the presence of PMA, dose-response profiles for IL-1β and TNFα were examined. HUVEC were treated with increasing doses of IL-1β, ranging from 16 to 400 pg/ml, or TNFα, from 20 to 500 pg/ml, in the presence or absence of PMA (100 ng/ml) (Fig. 3). The dose curve for IL-1β-mediated induction of E-selectin mRNA revealed that in the presence of PMA, E-selectin was cooperatively induced by IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, E-selectin mRNA expression was only slightly increased by treatment with increasing doses of TNFα in the presence or absence of PMA. The synergistic effect of combined treatment with IL-1β and PMA on E-selectin mRNA induction is independent of de novoprotein synthesis, because it was potentiated and not inhibited by the presence of cycloheximide at the concentration (10 μg/ml) sufficient to inhibit protein synthesis by 95% (33Hamilton T.A. Jansen M.M. Somers S.D. Adams D.O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To determine if the effects of IL-1β, TNFα, and PMA on the gene expression of adhesion molecules are mediated by increased transcriptional activity of the genes, nuclear run-on studies were performed. HUVEC cultures were treated with IL-1β and TNFα, either alone or in combination with PMA for 2 h; nuclei were isolated; and the transcription that had started in intact cells was allowed to reach completion in the presence of [32P]UTP. The radiolabeled RNA transcripts were subsequently hybridized to slot-blotted plasmid DNA fragments encoding E-selectin, ICAM-1, or β-actin (Fig. 4). While either IL-1β, TNFα, or PMA weakly stimulated transcription of the E-selectin gene, the combination of IL-1β and PMA synergistically increased E-selectin transcription. In contrast, cotreatment with TNFα and PMA did not have a marked cooperative effect. On the other hand, ICAM-1 transcription was induced by IL-1β, TNFα, or PMA, and treatment with either IL-1β or TNFα combined with PMA had only an additive effect on the transcription of the gene. These results are largely consistent with the levels of specific mature mRNA found in total cellular RNA, indicating that the coexistence of classic PKC activation and the intracellular signals generated by IL-1β, but not by TNFα, synergize E-selectin mRNA induction principally via the activation of specific transcription. To identify the cis-regulatory sequences required for the synergistic effect of IL-1β and PMA on induction of E-selectin mRNA expression, HUVEC were transiently transfected with a series of 5′-flanking deletion mutants inserted into a firefly luciferase expression vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, FCS in the medium was reduced to 0.5%, and the HUVEC were cultured further for 24 h. Then the cells were treated for 6 h with IL-1β or TNFα, either alone or in combination with PMA (100 ng/ml), and harvested for the luciferase assay. A transient transfection study on HUVEC with a deletion mutant with 800 bp upstream of the transcription start site demonstrated that simultaneous treatment with IL-1β and PMA induced the luciferase activity synergistically, while cotreatment with TNFα and PMA caused only additive induction (Fig.5 B), as found in nuclear run-on studies (Fig. 4). This result demonstrates that the promoter region from −800 to +50 bp of the E-selectin gene is sufficient for the synergistic effect of IL-1β and PMA. As shown in Fig.5 C, all of the deletion mutants from 800 to 166 bp upstream of the transcription start site induced luciferase activity to equivalent levels in response to cotreatment with IL-1β and PMA. However, the deletion mutant with 116 bp of the upstream sequence was not able to induce the luciferase gene synergistically in response to the cotreatment, indicating that a critical promoter region involved in the synergistic E-selectin gene expression on cotreatment with IL-1β and PMA lies within the −166 to −116 bp region. As shown in Fig.5 A, this region between −166 and −116 bp of the E-selectin promoter gene contains one NF-ELAM1/ATF site (34van Huijsduijnen R.H. Whelan J. Pescini R. Becker-Andre M. Schenk A.M.

To further delineate the precise element(s) within the −166 to −116 bp region required for the synergism between IL-1β and PMA, we constructed a deletion mutant with 129 bp of the upstream sequence in which the NF-ELAM1/ATF site was deleted and examined its luciferase inducibility (Fig.6 A). The 166-bp of the upstream sequence was able to induce the synergistic expression of the luciferase gene in response to simultaneous treatment with IL-1β and PMA, whereas only additive induction was seen when TNFα was substituted for IL-1β. However, a reporter construct with 129 bp of the upstream sequence did not exhibit synergistic induction of the luciferase gene at all.

This is reminiscent of immunoglobulins, which can be raised against and specifically bind such structures (19Bedzyk W.D. Herron J.N. Edmundson A.B. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol.

This is of particular interest, because TCR genes, unlike immunoglobulin genes, have no somatic mutations allowing affinity maturation. Moreover, TCR need to recognize hapten or carbohydrate moieties in the context of an MHC-peptide complex in a predefined orientation (21Garboczi D.N. Ghosh P. Utz U. Fan Q.R. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C.

In this orientation, the CDR3 loops can interact extensively with peptide side chains, which are mainly located in the center of MHC molecules, as well as with residues of the MHC α-helices. The α-helices of MHC class I molecules are elevated at the N-terminal portions; therefore, the approximately planar surface of the TCR ligand binding site can realize the best contact with the ligand in a diagonal orientation (21Garboczi D.N.

Using mutational analysis, mapping of the photoaffinity-labeled site(s) and molecular modeling, we identified a specific binding mode, how the T1 TCR binds the ABA group. We propose that this binding principle has universal aspects. Amino acids and other chemicals were obtained from Bachem Finechemicals AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland), Sigma Chemie (Buchs, Switzerland), and Neosystems (Strasbourg, France).

HPLC-purified peptide derivatives were reconstituted in PBS at 1 mm. The specific radioactivity of 125I conjugates was approximately 2000 Ci/mmol. For the cytolytic assay,51Cr-labeled P815 cells (5 × 103cells/well) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in medium containing 10-fold dilutions of peptide derivatives, followed by UV irradiation at ≥350 nm. Cloned T1 CTL (1.5 × 104cells/well) were added, and after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, released 51Cr was determined. The specific lysis was calculated as 100 × ((experimental − spontaneous release)/(total − spontaneous release)). The relative antigenic activities were calculated by dividing the concentration of IASA-YIPSAEK(ABA)I required for half-maximal lysis by that required for the variant peptide derivatives. These values were normalized by division with the corresponding relative Kd competitor activities (14Romero P. Casanova J.-L. Cerottini J.-C. Maryanski J.L. Luescher I.F. J. Exp.

For peptide mapping, T1 CTL (4 × 107) were incubated likewise with Kd-SYIPSAEK(125IASA)I (1 mCi) in 2 ml of medium containing β2-microglobulin (2.5 μg/ml). After UV irradiation at ≥350 nm, cells were washed twice and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (1 × 107 cells/ml) containing 0.7% Nonidet P-40, HEPES, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and iodoacetamide. The detergent-soluble fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-TCR Cβ monoclonal antibody H57–597. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%, reducing conditions) and quantified using a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). S.D. values were calculated from 2–4 experiments. T1 α and β cDNAs extending from the 5′ terminus up to, but not including, bases encoding the extracellular membrane-proximal cysteine residues were generated by reverse transcription on total T1 CTL RNA followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The DNA fragments encoding a linker sequence and leucine zipper (LZ) components were generated by using oligonucleotides and PCR on templates pACID and pBASE (27Chang H.C. Bao Z.Z. Yao Y. Tse A.G.D. Goyarts E.C. Madsen M. Kawasaki E. Brauer P.P. Sacchettini J.C. Nathenson S.G. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11408-11412Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The T1 TCR-leucine zipper cDNAs were prepared by using recombinant PCR on these templates. The T1αLZ and T1βLZ cDNA containing basic and acidic LZ, respectively, were cloned into pCR-script (Stratagene) and subcloned into the EcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega). All PCR amplifications were performed usingPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and both strands of cloned inserts were sequenced and found to be error-free. TCR mutants were generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the suppliers instructions. 293T cells (ATCC) were transfected with pT1αLZ and pT1βLZ DNA (1:2 ratio) for transient expression of soluble αβT1 TCR following published procedures (28Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). After 2 days, supernatants were harvested, and T1 TCR concentrations were equalized. Preparation of T1 single chain Fv cDNA constructs and protein expression were performed as described previously (29Grégoire C. Lin S.Y. Mazza G. Rebai N. Luescher I.F. Malissen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A full-length Kd cDNA cloned in pKC expression vector (promotor SV40, Hanahan) was double-digested withHindIII and XbaI in order to excise the sequences encoding the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains up to nucleotide 966. The vector was religated using aHindIII–XbaI linker containing a stop codon, giving rise to translated C terminus RWKLA-stop. This KdcDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the TransformerTM kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Full-length cDNA coding for β2m was prepared and inserted in the same vector using the proper linkers (30Godeau F. Casanova J.-L. Fairchild K.D. Saucier C. Delarbre C. Gachelin G. Kourilsky P. Res. Immunol. 1991; 142: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). All procedures have been described previously (13Anjuère F. Kuznetsov D. Romero P. Cerottini J.-C. Jongeneel V. Luescher I.F.

Biochemicals for Protein Research. Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN1987: 87-108Google Scholar). In brief, photoaffinity-labeled T1 TCR was reduced, alkylated, and reconstituted in 500 μl of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (for tryptic digests) or 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8 (for V8 digests) containing 10% acetonitrile. Aliquots of enzymes (10 μg) were added in 12-h intervals, and after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, the digests were subjected to reverse phase HPLC on an analytical C-18 column (4 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size, Vydac, Hisperia, CA). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, rising within 1 h from 0 to 75%. Elution of radioactivity was monitored by γ-counting of 1-ml fractions. For destructive digestion the double-labeled V8 and Asp-N digest fragment was reconstituted in 300 μl of citrate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and Nonidet P-40 (0.01%) and incubated at 37 °C for 36 h with cathepsin C and carboxypeptidases P. Enzymes (5 μg) were added every 12 h. For biosynthetic labeling of T1 TCR with [3H]tyrosine, CD8 α/β-transfected T1.4 T cell hybridomas (0.7 × 106) were incubated in tyrosine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (5%) and 5 mCi of [3H]tyrosine (NEN Life Science Products; specific activity of 142 Ci/mmol) at 37 °C for 20 h. The washed cells were photoaffinity-labeled with Kd-SYIPSAEK(125IASA)I (specific radioactivity of 20 Ci/mmol). The M r values of the labeled digest fragments were assessed by SDS-PAGE as described (32Schragger A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). A homology model of the T1 TCR and the Kd-SYIPSAEK(ABA)I complex was built using the MODELLER program (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) based on the crystal coordinates of TCR A6 (Vα2.3, Jα24; Vβ12.3, Jβ2.1)-HLA-A2-Tax peptide complex (21Garboczi D.N. Ghosh P. Utz U. Fan Q.R. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), TCR 2C (Vα3, Jα58; Vβ8.2, Jβ2.4) (22Garcia K.C. Degano M. Stanfield R.L. Brunmark A.

A. 1995; 92: 2479-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The related sequences of corresponding chains were aligned using a dynamic programming method implemented in the MODELLER program (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). An all atom model of the complex was built using MODELLER by satisfaction of spatial restraints obtained from the alignment and parameters in the program. A distance restraint was introduced initially between the phenyl rings of ABA and β-Tyr48 and β-Tyr50, respectively. Side chain orientations were optimized using a backbone-dependent rotamer library (36Dunbrack R.L. Karplus M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 37Bower J.M. Cohen F.E. Dunbrack R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1268-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). CDR1β and CDR2β loops were not subsequently refined, since their conformation was modeled from the TCR 2C, which has the same Vβ8.2 as TCR T1. For the other CDR loops, the conformations with the low energies were identified by simulated annealing with the rest of the structure fixed. From these, the final loop orientations were selected by using data from the mutation experiments. The resulting structure was refined with 500 steps of steepest descent energy minimization using the CHARMM (version 25) program (38Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olasfon B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar) with the all-atom PARAM 22 parameter set (39MacKerell Jr., A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Karplus M. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11819) Google Scholar). No significant violation of spatial restraints was found for β-Tyr48, β-Tyr50, and K(ABA)after optimization, indicating that the imposed distance restraint does not imply a distortion of the structure. Details concerning the modeling will be presented separately. 2O. Michielin and M. Karplus, manuscript in preparation. To obtain information on PbCS(ABA) contacts with T1 TCR, several PbCS(ABA) variants were assessed by TCR photoaffinity labeling with soluble Kd-125IASA-YIPSAEK(ABA)I complexes (Fig.1 A). The replacement of PbCS Pro255 by Ala, Asp, or Ser reduced T1 TCR labeling by 10-, 100-, and 17-fold, respectively, whereas replacement by Leu increased it 2-fold, suggesting that voluminous aliphatic residues in this position stabilize, and polar ones destabilize, T1 TCR-ligand binding. Alanine substitution of PbCS Ser256 impaired T1 TCR photoaffinity labeling by 95%. Substitution of PbCS Glu258with alanine or glutamine obliterated detectable T1 TCR labeling, indicating that Glu258 forms a polar contact with T1 TCR. Shortening of PbCS Lys259 by one methylene group (YIPSAEOrn(ABA)I) also abolished T1 TCR labeling, indicating that the full spacer length was required. To define the interaction of ABA with T1 TCR, PbCS(ABA) variants with modified ABA were examined. These nonphotoreactive compounds were assessed in a cytolytic assay as derivatives of SYIPSAEK(ABA)I (Fig.1 B). Cloned T1 CTL killed target cells sensitized with SYIPSAEK(benzoic acid)I approximately 100-fold less efficiently than those sensitized with SYIPSAEK(ABA)I. Replacement of the phenylazide by a methyl group (SYIPSAEK(Ac)I) obliterated detectable antigen recognition, while introduction of an iodine and hydroxy substituent in ABA (YIPSAEK(IASA)I) reduced the efficiency of antigen recognition by 8-fold. These results indicate that the phenylazide of the ABA moiety was essential for antigen recognition and that changes of substituents predictably affected the efficiency of recognition. To identify Kd-TCR contacts, we prepared soluble Kd and 12 Kd mutants containing single alanine substitutions on the surface of the α1 or α2 helices (Fig.2). After photo-cross-linking with radiolabeled 125IASA-YIPSAEK(ABA)I, TCR-ligand binding was assessed by T1 TCR photoaffinity labeling, as described above. Six of the Kd mutations impaired T1 TCR-ligand binding by ≥50%. Two were on Kdα1 (E62A and Q72A), and four were on Kdα2 (Q149A, D152A, Y155A, and E166A). Some Kd mutations increased T1 TCR photoaffinity labeling by up to 20% (S69A, R79A, and E163A). To define ligand contact residues, soluble T1 TCR and 31 mutants were prepared and tested by T1 TCR photoaffinity labeling with soluble Kd-125IASA-YIPSAEK(ABA)I (Fig.3). Seven of these mutations reduced TCR photoaffinity labeling by ≥90%. Three of these were in CDR3 loops, three others were in CDR1, and one was in CDR2α. In addition, six other mutations reduced T1 TCR photoaffinity labeling by ≥50%. Four of these were in CDR2α, one was in CDR2β, and one was in CDR3α. Several mutations increased TCR photoaffinity labeling by up to 60% (e.g. αN27A, βY50F, and βT55A). Mutants labeled with an asterisk were T1 TCR Fv single chain constructs (29Grégoire C. Lin S.Y. Mazza G. Rebai N. Luescher I.F. Malissen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To localize the photoaffinity-labeled site(s), T1 TCR was photoaffinity-labeled with SYIPSAEK(125IASA)I, a derivative that was efficiently recognized by T1 CTL (Fig. 1 B) and, being monovalent, precluded cross-linking with Kd. Since T1 TCR was photoaffinity-labeled exclusively at the β-chain (15Luescher I.F. Anjuère F. Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel V. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Immunity. 1995; 3: 51-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the photoaffinity-labeled TCR was directly subjected to peptide mapping. After extensive digestion with trypsin, the resulting digest fragments were separated by reverse phase HPLC. The major labeled digest fragment eluted from the C-18 column after 30 min and according to SDS-PAGE was homogenous and had an apparent M r of approximately 3000 (Fig. 4,lane 2). When protease V8 was used instead of trypsin, a major labeled material eluted from the column after 32–33 min, which migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparentM r of approximately 8300 (Fig. 4,lane 1). The size of this fragment was bigger than any theoretical V8 fragment of the variable domain of the T1 TCR β-chain (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that protease V8, even after extensive digestion, omitted a cleavage site. Since this enzyme primarily cleaves C-terminal to Glu and hence may fail to cleave after Asp (31Keesey J. Biochemicals for Protein Research. Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN1987: 87-108Google Scholar), the labeled V8 digest product was digested with protease Asp-N. Essentially the same HPLC profile was observed; however, on SDS-PAGE this material migrated with an apparent M r of approximately 2000 (Fig. 4, lane 3), indicating that V8 failed to cleave at an aspartic acid. This residue probably was β-Asp38, because the big reduction in size (approximately 6300 Da) may correspond to the size of the segment 2–37, which contains the glycosylation site β-Asn24 (Fig. 5 B and Ref. 34Bentley G.A.

https://openalex.org/W1970246750,"Previous detailed mutational analysis has shown that the binding site on adenovirus (Ad) early region 1A (E1A) for TATA-binding protein (TBP) is located toward the N terminus of conserved region 3 (CR3). Here we demonstrate that synthetic peptides of between 15 and 22 amino acids, identical to amino acid sequences of CR3 present in the larger Ad5 E1A (13 S product) and in both the Ad12 E1A (13 and 12 S products) proteins that lie N-terminal to the zinc finger motif, can disrupt binding of E1A to TBP. These findings suggest that the peptides are biologically active in terms of interacting with TBP and must therefore comprise some, if not all, of the TBP binding site on E1A. The interaction between Ad12 E1A and TBP was confirmed by direct co-precipitation experiments. In 1H NMR studies of CR3 peptides, regular patterns of NOEs were observed from which their conformational preferences in aqueous solution were determined. Both Ad5 and Ad12 peptides were shown to contain regions of helical backbone structure in 50% trifluoroethanol. In each case, the type and intensities of NOE cross-peaks observed correlated best to α-helical turns. These helices are more extensive in larger peptides and extend from Glu141 to Val147 and from Arg144 to Pro152 in the full-length Ad5 and Ad12 13S E1A proteins, respectively. The structure of a 19-residue Ad5 CR3 peptide carrying the V147L mutation in the full-length protein that abolishes TBP binding was examined. No significant differences between the substituted and wild type peptides were observed, suggesting that this substitution in the intact protein may cause disruption of global rather than local structures.

Either together or separately, they are capable of inducing a variety of effects in mammalian cells. Following viral infection, they stimulate expression of other viral genes (1Jones N. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3656-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2Berk A.J. Lee F. Harrison T. Williams J. Sharp P.A.

In addition, introduction of E1A DNA into cells can have profound biological effects. For example, it can induce apoptosis, primarily through increasing p53 expression (5Rao L. Debbas M. Sabbatini P. Hockenberry D. Kormeyer S. White E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 6Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), induce DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression in quiescent cells (7Braithwaite A.W. Cheetham B.F. Li P. Parish C.R. Waldron-Stevens L.K. Bellet A.J.D. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 192-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Quinlan M.P. Grodzicker T. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 673-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibit differentiation (9Webster K.A. Muscat G.E.O. Kedes L. Nature. 1988; 332: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Kalman D. Whittaker K. Bishop J.M. O'Lague P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and under certain circumstances induce morphological transformation (11Gallimore P.H. Byrd P.J. Whittaker J.L. Grand R.J.A. Cancer Res. 1988; 45: 2670-2680Google Scholar). It seems likely that all of these results are attributable to the ability of the E1A proteins to interact with and modify the activity of important cellular regulators (reviewed in, for example, Refs. 12Moran E. Semin. Virol. 1994; 5: 327-340Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar and 13Bayley S.T. Mymryk J.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 5: 425-444Google Scholar). Although E1A proteins from different virus serotypes have many properties in common, certain important differences have been noted. Most significantly, group A adenoviruses (e.g. Ad12) can cause tumors in newborn rodents, while the group C viruses (e.g. Ad2 and Ad5) are nononcogenic. These differences have been attributed to activities of E1A (reviewed in Ref. 14Williams J. Williams M. Lu C. Telling G. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 199: 149-175Google Scholar). However, comparison of the amino acid sequences of E1As from different virus serotypes has indicated a number of highly conserved regions (CR). Mutational and biochemical analysis has demonstrated that these are involved in many although not all of the interactions with cellular proteins. For example, E1A binds to the retinoblastoma gene product pRb and related proteins p107 and p130 through conserved region 1 (amino acids 40–80) and conserved region 2 (amino acids 120–139; Refs. 15Whyte P. Williamson N.M. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 56: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholarand 16Dyson N. Guida P. McCall C. Harlow E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4606-4611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, interaction of E1A with the transcriptional regulator p300 is through CR1 and the much less well conserved N-terminal domain (17Wang H-G.H. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. Deaprio A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). A further complex formed by E1A involves a short region very close to the C terminus, which although not identified as a conserved region in the original studies (19Kimelman D. Miller J.S. Porter D. Roberts B.E. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 399-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Moran E. Mathews M. Cell. 1987; 48: 177-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) is highly homologous in proteins from different viral serotypes. This domain of E1A is involved in interaction with a 48-kDa cellular phosphoprotein termed the C-terminal binding protein (21Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaefer U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Of central importance to the role of Ad E1A as a regulator of gene expression is the “unique” conserved region 3, which is only present in its entirety in the larger E1A component. The C terminus of the domain binds certain members of the ATF family of DNA binding proteins (22Pei R. Berk A.J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3499-3506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lui F. Green M.R.

Gaire M. Hauss C. Reimund B. Goetz J. Kedinger C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, the CR3 region is probably involved in interaction with the cellular YY1 transcription factor (26Lewis B.A. Tullis G. Seto E. Horkoshi N. Weinmann R. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1628-1636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the best characterized protein-protein interaction involving conserved region 3 is with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), the DNA binding subunit of transcription factor IID (27Horkoshi N.

Brockmann D. Virus Res. 1997; 54: 99-106Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The contribution of each amino acid in Ad5 CR3 to TBP binding and to trans-activation has been studied in detail (28Lee W.S. Kao C. Bryant G.O. Liu X. Berk A.J.

However, it is not clear whether the zinc finger forms part of the interface or is simply required for the overall three-dimensional structure of the region (discussed in Ref. 34Jones N. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 59-80PubMed Google Scholar). While mutation of cysteine residues in CR3 (the zinc-coordinating amino acids) leads to a marked reduction in TBP binding (32Geisberg J.V. Lee W.S. Berk A.J. Ricciardi R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), it has been shown that point mutations in the region N-terminal to the zinc finger also inhibit the interaction with TBP. In addition, the substitutions V147L, E148G, P150A, and G151A on Ad5 E1A or deletion of amino acids 139–149 reduced binding to TBP (28Lee W.S. Kao C. Bryant G.O. Liu X. Berk A.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 365-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar,32Geisberg J.V. Lee W.S. Berk A.J. Ricciardi R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the work described here, we set out to analyze whether that portion of Ad E1A CR3, N-terminal to the zinc finger domain, was capable of interaction with TBP. In addition, the three-dimensional structure of the region was examined. These studies have been carried out using short synthetic peptides equivalent to the N-terminal sequences of Ad5 and Ad12 CR3 (Fig. 1). It has long been known that small synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences from proteins can adopt secondary structures analogous to that seen in the intact molecule. Such peptides are most frequently found to adopt either helical (35Segawa S.-I. Fukuno T. Fujiwara K. Noda Y. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), or β-turn (36Smith L.J. Alexandrescu A.T. Pitkeathly M. Doson C.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Molloy D.P. Milner A.E. Yakub I.K. Chinnadurai G. Gallimore P.H. Grand R.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20867-20876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) secondary structures, since the key interactions required to maintain the conformation (including hydrogen bonds) are short range and limited only by the number of amino acids within the peptide. Where a synthetic peptide mimics the structure of a binding site within a protein, it is clearly possible for that peptide also to mimic complex biological functions associated with the protein. For example, it has been shown that a peptide equivalent to CR3, when microinjected into cells, will activate expression from the adenovirus major late promoter (38Lillie J.W. Loewenstein P.M. Green M.R. Green M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the study presented here, we have shown that peptides equivalent to sequences from CR3 in both Ad5 and Ad12 E1A can inhibit binding of TBP to E1A. We have determined the structures of several peptides in solution by 1H NMR spectroscopy and suggest that the helical conformation adopted by each of these peptides is similar to the TBP binding motif on CR3 in intact E1A. Four synthetic peptides identical in sequence to portions of conserved region 3 from both Ad5 13 S E1A and Ad12 13 S E1A were used in this study (Fig. 1). The peptides were synthesized by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) procedures (Alta Bioscience, University of Birmingham) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 column eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile (0–60%) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The expression and purification of Ad12 E1A was performed as described (39Grand R.J.A. Gash L. Milner A.E. Molloy D.P. Turnell A.T. Szestak T. Gallimore P.H. Virology. 1998; 244: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Ad12 13 S E1A and Ad12 12 S E1A were expressed inEscherichia coli strain TG2 using the pKK 388–1 expression vector. Three hours after induction of a 3.0-liter culture in the presence of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. E1A was then purified using essentially the protocol described earlier (39Grand R.J.A. Gash L. Milner A.E. Molloy D.P. Turnell A.T. Szestak T. Gallimore P.H. Virology. 1998; 244: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 40Grand R.J.A. Gallimore P.H. J. Gen. Virol. 1984; 65: 2149-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Pure E1A was renatured by prolonged dialysis against 10 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C (39Grand R.J.A. Gash L. Milner A.E. Molloy D.P. Turnell A.T. Szestak T. Gallimore P.H. Virology. 1998; 244: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). E1A was considered to have adopted a native conformation based on its ability to bind to TBP (see below), C-terminal binding protein, Rb p105, and zinc (39Grand R.J.A. Gash L. Milner A.E. Molloy D.P. Turnell A.T. Szestak T. Gallimore P.H. Virology. 1998; 244: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). TBP was expressed from a pGex vector in Escherichia coli strain TG2 as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST; a generous gift from Dr. N. Jones, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). GST-TBP was eluted from glutathione-agarose (Sigma) in the presence of 25 mmglutathione, and purity was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified Ad12 E1A (15 μg in 10 μl of NETN buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40)) was incubated with GST-TBP (60 μg in 30 μl of NETN buffer) at 4 °C. After 1 h, glutathione-agarose beads (50 μl) that had been preblocked with 5% skimmed milk powder were added. This mixture was agitated for 90 min at 4 °C. Agarose beads were retrieved by centrifugation and washed three times with NETN buffer. 5 mm glutathione (15 μl) was added to the washed agarose beads, and the released proteins were mixed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. After polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, Ad12 E1A was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody 5D02, developed by us. 2P. H. Gallimore and R. J. A. Grand, unpublished data. The effect of synthetic Ad CR3 peptide on the Ad12 E1A-TBP interaction was monitored by incubating peptide with GST-TBP for 1 h prior to the addition of E1A. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) for Ad E1A CR3 peptides binding to GST-TBP was assessed by competition with purified bacterially expressed Ad12 266-aa E1A using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique essentially as described (37Molloy D.P. Milner A.E. Yakub I.K. Chinnadurai G. Gallimore P.H. Grand R.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20867-20876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Ninety-six-well plates were coated with Ad12 E1A (0.1 μg/well) by incubation overnight at 4 °C. E1A peptides serially diluted from 0 to 250 μg/ml were mixed with GST-TBP (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 23 °C prior to adding to each well. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the plates were washed six times with 0.1% Tween 80 in phosphate-buffered saline. TBP bound to E1A in the presence of synthetic peptide was determined on the plates with a goat antibody against GST followed by a horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody against goat IgG. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured after the addition of substrate using a Bio-Tek plate reader. Determinations were carried out in triplicate, and data were analyzed using a nonlinear least-squares approach (37Molloy D.P. Milner A.E. Yakub I.K. Chinnadurai G. Gallimore P.H. Grand R.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20867-20876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism measurements were performed on an Applied Biophysics CD spectrometer using a 1-cm path length quartz cell at 25, 35, 45, 55, and 65 °C. Each spectrum was the average of five scans of peptide dissolved in 1 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.4. Buffer background was subtracted. The concentrations of the wild type and V147L forms of the 19-aa Ad5 CR3 peptide were 100 μm. One-dimensional 1H NMR data were collected on a Bruker AMX500 spectrometer using samples of peptide at 300 μm concentration in 25 mm[2H]Tris, 5 mm[2H]dithiothreitol adjusted to pH 7.4 with [2H]Cl. A gated presaturation pulse of 1.5 s was used for accumulation over a 5000-Hz sweep width at an ambient probe temperature of 293 K with a 90° pulse of 5 μs. Spectra were recorded as 256 free induction decays and Fourier-transformed. GST-TBP and GST proteins used in one-dimensional experiments were dialyzed exhaustively against 25 mm [2H]Tris, 5 mm [2H]dithiothreitol adjusted to pH 7.4 with [2H]Cl and added directly to the NMR tube to give ratios of peptide to protein of between 200:1 and 20:1. The pH was monitored directly in the NMR tube using an Ingold 3060 electrode and adjusted to pH 7.4 using [2H]Cl or NaO[2H]. Two-dimensional experiments were acquired using either a Bruker AMX500 spectrometer or a Varian Unity Plus 600-MHz spectrometer with 2048 data points in F2 with a sweep width of 11 ppm and with between 360 and 608 rows in F1. Solutions of peptide were between 5 and 10 mm in concentration, 285 K at pH 5.5 in 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol (TFE)-d 3, 40% H2O, 10% 2H2O. [2H]Dithiothreitol was added to all peptide samples used in NMR spectroscopy to final concentrations of between 5 and 10 mm to prevent intermolecular disulfide bridge formation. The water resonance was suppressed by very weak presaturation applied during the relaxation delay (1.5 s) or by using a WATERGATE sequence (41Piotto M. Saudek V. Skelnar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar). Solvent artifacts were suppressed using pulsed field gradients (42Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1994; 103: 203-216Crossref Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) used an MLEV-17 mixing pulse of 60-ms duration (10-kHz spin locking field). Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments were performed using mixing times of 100-, 200-, and 400-ms duration. Between 32 and 96 transients were acquired for TOCSY and double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy (COSY) experiments and between 96 and 128 transients for NOESY experiments. Assignments of proton signals in the peptides were based upon TOCSY and quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy experiments to identify spin systems within individual residues that were then coupled to sequential NOE cross-peaks (e.g. d αN(i, i + 1) in NOESY experiments. For the assignment of proline residues within the peptides, the δ-CH2 proton signals were used in place ofd αN signals. Interproton distances were estimated from NOESY experiments (200-ms mixing time duration) by integrating the contours for each cross-peak. The distances were then grouped into five classes between strong and very weak (the strong and medium NOEs were allocated the same distance constraints in structural calculations). The patterns of backbone hydrogen bonding within the peptides were assessed by following the movement of chemical shift of backbone amide protons with changes in temperature (at 285, 290, 295, 300, and 305 K) in TOCSY experiments. Temperature shift coefficients were calculated from the slope of a plot of temperature against chemical shift and were linear in every case. The structures of peptides were determined using X-PLOR 3.8.5.1 (43Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, Cambridge, MA1992Google Scholar) using a protocol in which certain atoms of each residue were embedded using the distance geometry routine (atoms CA, HA, N, HN, CB*, CG*,dg_sub_embed protocol). The remaining atoms were placed by template fitting, and then the atomic coordinates were allowed to evolve under the applied NOE distance constraints during a series of simulated annealing steps (dgsa and refineprotocols). From the 100 structures generated, approximately 25–30 were discarded (wrong orientation in the distance geometry routine). The remaining structures were chosen with no violations of the applied NOEs of greater than 0.5 Å. TFE was used as a co-solvent with water in this study, since it is well known that TFE/water mixtures enhance the solution structures of small peptides, primarily by providing an environment in which hydrogen bond formation within the peptide is promoted. TFE also reduces the formation of spurious secondary structures as a result of hydrophobic aggregation (44Smith K.J. Trayer I.P. Grand R.J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6063-6073Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 45Smith K.J. Scotland G. Beattie J. Trayer I.P. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16703-16711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that the integrity of the N-terminal portion of Ad5 CR3 (aa 139–149) is essential for interaction of E1A with TBP and trans-activation (28Lee W.S. Kao C. Bryant G.O. Liu X. Berk A.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 365-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 32Geisberg J.V. Lee W.S. Berk A.J. Ricciardi R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, there is little or no structural information available on E1A, and therefore the precise consequences of these deletions and mutations are unknown. Here, we have assessed whether synthetic peptides, identical in sequence to the N terminus of CR3 of Ad5 and Ad12 E1A (Fig.1) interact with TBP. We have also examined the structure of the N-terminal portion of CR3, which comprises some, and perhaps all, of the TBP binding site on adenovirus E1A. Our initial aim was to demonstrate an interaction between TBP and E1A and then use this as an assay to determine the affinity of TBP for Ad E1A CR3 synthetic peptides. The Western blot presented in Fig.2 A confirms that purified bacterially expressed Ad12 13 S E1A binds to TBP and that this interaction is not disrupted by washing with NETN buffer (lane 1). A similar interaction occurs between Ad12 12 S E1A and GST-TBP (Fig. 2 A; lane 2), although it appears that considerably less Ad12 12 S E1A than 13 S E1A binds to TBP in this assay. Thus, determinants present in part of CR3 (i.e. the zinc finger) in the larger E1A molecule are important for the interaction. It should be noted that the monoclonal antibody 5D02 reacts somewhat more strongly with 13 S E1A than with 12 S E1A. 3D. P. Molloy, K. J. Smith, A. E. Milner, P. H. Gallimore, and R. J. A. Grand, unpublished data. In the absence of the full complement of structural determinants found in full-length E1A, the affinity of GST-TBP for the synthetic peptides is expected to be lower than for the intact protein. Thus, the ability of the synthetic peptides to disrupt Ad12 13 S E1A binding to GST-TBP was assessed under conditions where the peptide was present at a concentration far in excess of either GST-TBP or Ad12 13 S E1A. The effect of increasing concentration of the 22-aa Ad12 peptide (amino acids 138–159; Fig. 1) upon the formation of the GST-TBP·Ad12 13 S E1A complex is shown in Fig. 2 B. In the absence (Fig.2 B, lane 1) or presence of 3 nmol of peptide (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) Ad12 13 S E1A was detected in the supernatant after elution with GST-TBP from the agarose with glutathione. However, in the presence of 12 nmol of peptide (excess of peptide to E1A of 25:1), the GST-TBP·E1A complex was disrupted (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), and therefore little E1A could be detected when TBP was displaced with glutathione. We have also examined the effect of peptides identical to the N terminus of CR3 from Ad5 13 S E1A upon the formation of GST-TBP·Ad12 13 S E1A complex. It was found that high concentrations of the wild type (Fig. 2 B, lane 4) and mutant (V147L; Fig. 2 B, lane 6) forms of the 19-residue Ad5 peptide (aa 136–154; Fig. 1.) disrupt the GST-TBP·E1A complex. In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques were employed (see “Experimental Procedures”) to determine the affinity of GST-TBP for the various peptides, and the K d values were evaluated. These were found to be 2.3 × 10−6, 3.2 × 10−6, and 2.1 × 10−6m for the 19-aa wild type and V147L Ad5 CR3 peptides and the 22-aa Ad12 CR3 peptide, respectively (data not shown). In view of the dramatic competitive effects of the Ad5 and Ad12 peptides upon the interaction between Ad12 13 S E1A and GST-TBP, it was deemed essential to examine the structural properties of the peptides. The structure of the 19-residue peptide identical to wild type Ad5 CR3 amino acids Asp136 to Cys154 (Fig. 1) was examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. A section from the NOESY spectrum (of mixing time 200-ms duration) of the peptide is shown in Fig. 3 A, and a summary of the observed NOEs is illustrated in Fig. 3 B. The calculated structure for the peptide is presented in Fig.4. In the absence of long range NOE cross-peaks, the backbone conformation at the C terminus (residues Gly151–Cys154) of the peptide shows pronounced variation. Over residues Asp136–Pro150, the conformation of the peptide backbone is more ordered. On the basis of the types and relative volumes of the NOE cross-peaksd αN(i, i + 3) NOEs Glu138–Glu141, Gly139–Phe142, Glu140–Val143, Val143–Tyr146, Leu144–Val147, Asp145–Glu148 andd αN(i, i + 4) NOEs Phe142–Tyr146 and Val143–Val147 (Fig. 3 B), the region Asp136–His149 forms a series of tight overlapping right-handed α-helical turns. Additionally, the side chain atoms of the residues involved in helix formation are unidirectional and adopt the classical α-helix side chain orientation. As expected, the peptide adopts a regular COi–NHi,i+ 4donor-acceptor α-helical hydrogen bonding pattern consistent with low temperature shift coefficients for Glu140 (1.9 ppb/K), Phe142 (3.0 ppb/K), Leu144 (2.0 ppb/K), and Tyr146 (2.5 ppb/K; data not shown).Figure 31 H NMR assignments and structural properties of the 19-aa wild type Ad5 (aa 136–154) peptide.
