https://openalex.org/W1967937854,"Early social isolation results in adult behavioral and cognitive dysfunction that correlates with white matter alterations. However, how social deprivation influences myelination and the significance of these myelin defects in the adult remained undefined. We show that mice isolated for 2 weeks immediately after weaning have alterations in prefrontal cortex function and myelination that do not recover with reintroduction into a social environment. These alterations, which occur only during this critical period, are phenocopied by loss of oligodendrocyte ErbB3 receptors, and social isolation leads to reduced expression of the ErbB3 ligand neuregulin-1. These findings indicate that social experience regulates prefrontal cortex myelination through neuregulin-1/ErbB3 signaling and that this is essential for normal cognitive function, thus providing a cellular and molecular context to understand the consequences of social isolation."

Elemental F 2 gas is in principle an efficient reagent for their preparation, but its extreme reactivity requires special handling precautions. Substantial research has therefore focused on promoting selective reactivity of more conveniently handled fluoride ion salts. Liu et al. (p. 1322 ) present a manganese catalyst that transfers fluoride to a range of hydrocarbons in conjunction with a hypervalent iodine-based oxidant. Mechanistic studies implicate a manganese difluoride intermediate that reacts with alkyl radicals generated by a preceding manganese oxo."

It is valuable to know bond order for rationalizing aromaticity, and reactivity and for chemical structure determination. Gross et al. (p. 1326 ; see the Perspective by Perez and the cover) differentiated the bond orders in individual molecules in the fullerene C 60 and in polyaromatic hydrocarbons by imaging with noncontact atomic force microscopy (AFM). The molecules were adsorbed onto a copper surface, and the AFM tip was decorated with a CO molecule, which was used to measure tip frequency shifts above the bonds and their apparent lengths. Multiple bonds appeared brighter in the images because of stronger Pauli repulsion, and their shorter length was amplified by bending of the CO at the tip apex."

https://openalex.org/W2018249152,"Intergenerational Transposable Shutdown Transposable elements (TEs) are a potential threat, especially to the germline genome. In many eukaryotes, TEs are shut down by DNA methylation and/or small-RNA–mediated silencing. Therefore, it seems counterintuitive that results obtained by Ibarra et al. (p. 1360 ) on Arabidopsis showed that in the cells of this plant's sexual apparatus, many small TEs are demethylated by DEMETER (DME) DNA glycosylase and become activated. But it turns out that activation of the TEs triggers the formation of small-interfering RNAs, which in these experiments were seen to travel from the surrounding cells to the egg. Thus, activation of TEs in the companion cells “immunizes” the gametes via the interfering RNAs that shutdown the TEs in the gametes permanently."

This presents a challenge in characterizing transient signaling complexes. Herzog et al. (p. 1348 ) used chemical cross-linking and mass spectroscopy (XL-MS) to characterize the modular and dynamic interaction network involving phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which interacts with tens of regulatory and adaptor proteins in diverse signaling pathways. They found 176 interprotein and 569 intraprotein distance restraints that delineated the topology of the network. The study establishes the importance of XL-MS in the suite of structural methods used to characterize dynamic assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W2065391646,"Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) and IRF8 regulate B, T, macrophage, and dendritic cell differentiation. They are recruited to cis-regulatory Ets-IRF composite elements by PU.1 or Spi-B. How these IRFs target genes in most T cells is enigmatic given the absence of specific Ets partners. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in T helper 17 (T(H)17) cells reveals that IRF4 targets sequences enriched for activating protein 1 (AP-1)-IRF composite elements (AICEs) that are co-bound by BATF, an AP-1 factor required for T(H)17, B, and dendritic cell differentiation. IRF4 and BATF bind cooperatively to structurally divergent AICEs to promote gene activation and T(H)17 differentiation. The AICE motif directs assembly of IRF4 or IRF8 with BATF heterodimers and is also used in T(H)2, B, and dendritic cells. This genomic regulatory element and cognate factors appear to have evolved to integrate diverse immunomodulatory signals."

https://openalex.org/W2122905516,"Reversing Autism in Mice Autism comprises a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by defects in communication and social inter action. A group of nonsyndromic forms of autism is associated with mutations in the neuroligin genes, which encode postsynaptic adhesion molecules. Using a reversible knockout approach, Baudouin et al. (p. 128 , published online 13 September) investigated the in vivo functions of neuroligin-3 in the mouse cerebellum. Mutant mice showed a major defect in metabotropic glutamate receptor–dependent, long-term potentiation; disrupted heterosynaptic competition; and ectopic synapse formation in vivo. These synaptic defects could be rescued by reactivation of the neuroligin gene in the adult."
https://openalex.org/W1966411806,"Distinguishing Right from Left In most vertebrates during embryonic development, rotational movement of the cilia within a structure in the embryo, known as the node, generates unidirectional flow required for future left-right asymmetry of the internal organs. The flow may transport a determinant molecule or provide mechanical force. However, it is not clear how the flow is sensed. Yoshiba et al. (p. 226 , published online 13 September; see the Perspective by Norris and Grimes ) show that nodal flow in mouse embryos is sensed by the cilia of perinodal cells located at the edge of the node, in a manner dependent on Pkd2, a Ca 2+ -permeable cation channel that has been implicated in polycystic kidney disease in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2079015162,"Conquering Rice Sterility The hybrid sterility occurring among rice species has long been a puzzle and hampers progress in breeding crops with improved performance and yield characteristics. Yang et al. (p. 1336 ) have identified three linked genes encoding a killer, a partner, and a protector protein. The killer and partner work together to kill female gametes not carrying the functional protector, resulting in preferential transmission of gametes carrying the functional protector, which also causes segregation distortion in the progeny. This explanation for how reproductive isolation is maintained among species of rice, and perhaps other organisms, also offers approaches for boosting yields by intersubspecific heterosis."

In plants, individual xylem cells are peppered with open pits that facilitate fluid transport and so Oda and Fukuda (p. 1333 ) studied ROP “Rho family guanosine triphosphatases of plants” proteins from xylem cells to investigate how pits develop. Formation of the pits seems to depend on MIDD1 to destabilize the microtubules at that point. A cascade of ROP proteins establishes the point at which MIDD1 functions, and reverse inhibition of one of the ROP proteins keeps the pit formation focused on a point."
https://openalex.org/W2025390999,"In iron-pnictide superconductivity, the interband interaction between the hole and electron Fermi surfaces (FSs) is believed to play an important role. However, KFe(2)As(2) has three zone-centered hole FSs and no electron FS but still exhibits superconductivity. Our ultrahigh-resolution laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy unveils that KFe(2)As(2) is a nodal s-wave superconductor with highly unusual FS-selective multi-gap structure: a nodeless gap on the inner FS, an unconventional gap with ""octet-line nodes"" on the middle FS, and an almost-zero gap on the outer FS. This gap structure may arise from the frustration between competing pairing interactions on the hole FSs causing the eightfold sign reversal. Our results suggest that the A(1g) superconducting symmetry is universal in iron-pnictides, in spite of the variety of gap functions."

https://openalex.org/W2022976083,"DNA methylation is sensitive and responsive to stressful environmental conditions. Nonetheless, the extent to which condition-induced somatic methylation modifications can impose transgenerational effects remains to be fully understood. Even less is known about the biological relevance of the induced epigenetic changes for potentially altered well-being of the organismal progenies regarding adaptation to the specific condition their progenitors experienced.We analyzed DNA methylation pattern by gel-blotting at genomic loci representing transposable elements and protein-coding genes in leaf-tissue of heavy metal-treated rice (Oryza sativa) plants (S0), and its three successive organismal generations. We assessed expression of putative genes involved in establishing and/or maintaining DNA methylation patterns by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. We measured growth of the stressed plants and their unstressed progenies vs. the control plants. We found (1) relative to control, DNA methylation patterns were modified in leaf-tissue of the immediately treated plants, and the modifications were exclusively confined to CHG hypomethylation; (2) the CHG-demethylated states were heritable via both maternal and paternal germline, albeit often accompanying further hypomethylation; (3) altered expression of genes encoding for DNA methyltransferases, DNA glycosylase and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factor (DDM1) were induced by the stress; (4) progenies of the stressed plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to the same stress their progenitor experienced, and this transgenerational inheritance of the effect of condition accompanying heritability of modified methylation patterns.Our findings suggest that stressful environmental condition can produce transgenerational epigenetic modifications. Progenies of stressed plants may develop enhanced adaptability to the condition, and this acquired trait is inheritable and accord with transmission of the epigenetic modifications. We suggest that environmental induction of heritable modifications in DNA methylation provides a plausible molecular underpinning for the still contentious paradigm of inheritance of acquired traits originally put forward by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck more than 200 years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2058183941,"Background Acidithiobacillus caldus (A. caldus) is widely used in bio-leaching. It gains energy and electrons from oxidation of elemental sulfur and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs) for carbon dioxide fixation and growth. Genomic analyses suggest that its sulfur oxidation system involves a truncated sulfur oxidation (Sox) system (omitting SoxCD), non-Sox sulfur oxidation system similar to the sulfur oxidation in A. ferrooxidans, and sulfur oxygenase reductase (SOR). The complexity of the sulfur oxidation system of A. caldus generates a big obstacle on the research of its sulfur oxidation mechanism. However, the development of genetic manipulation method for A. caldus in recent years provides powerful tools for constructing genetic mutants to study the sulfur oxidation system. Results An A. caldus mutant lacking the sulfur oxygenase reductase gene (sor) was created and its growth abilities were measured in media using elemental sulfur (S0) and tetrathionate (K2S4O6) as the substrates, respectively. Then, comparative transcriptome analysis (microarrays and real-time quantitative PCR) of the wild type and the Δsor mutant in S0 and K2S4O6 media were employed to detect the differentially expressed genes involved in sulfur oxidation. SOR was concluded to oxidize the cytoplasmic elemental sulfur, but could not couple the sulfur oxidation with the electron transfer chain or substrate-level phosphorylation. Other elemental sulfur oxidation pathways including sulfur diooxygenase (SDO) and heterodisulfide reductase (HDR), the truncated Sox pathway, and the S4I pathway for hydrolysis of tetrathionate and oxidation of thiosulfate in A. caldus are proposed according to expression patterns of sulfur oxidation genes and growth abilities of the wild type and the mutant in different substrates media. Conclusion An integrated sulfur oxidation model with various sulfur oxidation pathways of A. caldus is proposed and the features of this model are summarized."
https://openalex.org/W2010463641,"Gigantism and dwarfism evolve in vertebrates restricted to islands. We describe four new species in the Rhinolophus hildebrandtii species-complex of horseshoe bats, whose evolution has entailed adaptive shifts in body size. We postulate that vicissitudes of palaeoenvironments resulted in gigantism and dwarfism in habitat islands fragmented across eastern and southern Africa. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences recovered two clades of R. hildebrandtii senso lato which are paraphyletic with respect to a third lineage (R. eloquens). Lineages differ by 7.7 to 9.0% in cytochrome b sequences. Clade 1 includes R. hildebrandtii sensu stricto from the east African highlands and three additional vicariants that speciated across an Afromontane archipelago through the Plio-Pleistocene, extending from the Kenyan Highlands through the Eastern Arc, northern Mozambique and the Zambezi Escarpment to the eastern Great Escarpment of South Africa. Clade 2 comprises one species confined to lowland savanna habitats (Mozambique and Zimbabwe). A third clade comprises R. eloquens from East Africa. Speciation within Clade 1 is associated with fixed differences in echolocation call frequency, and cranial shape and size in populations isolated since the late Pliocene (ca 3.74 Mya). Relative to the intermediate-sized savanna population (Clade 2), these island-populations within Clade 1 are characterised by either gigantism (South African eastern Great Escarpment and Mts Mabu and Inago in Mozambique) or dwarfism (Lutope-Ngolangola Gorge, Zimbabwe and Soutpansberg Mountains, South Africa). Sympatry between divergent clades (Clade 1 and Clade 2) at Lutope-Ngolangola Gorge (NW Zimbabwe) is attributed to recent range expansions. We propose an ""Allometric Speciation Hypothesis"", which attributes the evolution of this species complex of bats to divergence in constant frequency (CF) sonar calls. The origin of species-specific peak frequencies (overall range = 32 to 46 kHz) represents the allometric effect of adaptive divergence in skull size, represented in the evolution of gigantism and dwarfism in habitat islands."
https://openalex.org/W2047722687,"Cellular Potts models (CPMs) are used as a modeling framework to elucidate mechanisms of biological development. They allow a spatial resolution below the cellular scale and are applied particularly when problems are studied where multiple spatial and temporal scales are involved. Despite the increasing usage of CPMs in theoretical biology, this model class has received little attention from mathematical theory. To narrow this gap, the CPMs are subjected to a theoretical study here. It is asked to which extent the updating rules establish an appropriate dynamical model of intercellular interactions and what the principal behavior at different time scales characterizes. It is shown that the longtime behavior of a CPM is degenerate in the sense that the cells consecutively die out, independent of the specific interdependence structure that characterizes the model. While CPMs are naturally defined on finite, spatially bounded lattices, possible extensions to spatially unbounded systems are explored to assess to which extent spatio-temporal limit procedures can be applied to describe the emergent behavior at the tissue scale. To elucidate the mechanistic structure of CPMs, the model class is integrated into a general multiscale framework. It is shown that the central role of the surface fluctuations, which subsume several cellular and intercellular factors, entails substantial limitations for a CPM's exploitation both as a mechanistic and as a phenomenological model."
https://openalex.org/W2132676793,"The malaria parasite replicates within an intraerythrocytic parasitophorous vacuole (PV). The PV and host cell membranes eventually rupture, releasing merozoites in a process called egress. Certain inhibitors of serine and cysteine proteases block egress, indicating a crucial role for proteases. The Plasmodium falciparum genome encodes nine serine-repeat antigens (SERAs), each of which contains a central domain homologous to the papain-like (clan CA, family C1) protease family. SERA5 and SERA6 are indispensable in blood-stage parasites, but the function of neither is known. Here we show that SERA6 localizes to the PV where it is precisely cleaved just prior to egress by an essential serine protease called PfSUB1. Mutations that replace the predicted catalytic Cys of SERA6, or that block SERA6 processing by PfSUB1, could not be stably introduced into the parasite genomic sera6 locus, indicating that SERA6 is an essential enzyme and that processing is important for its function. We demonstrate that cleavage of SERA6 by PfSUB1 converts it to an active cysteine protease.

Some of the worlds most important parasitic diseases, including malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis, are caused by protozoan pathogens of the phylum Apicomplexa. A unifying feature of this group of parasites is their requirement to replicate within the confines of a host cell. Blood-stage forms of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium spp., invade erythrocytes where they undergo multiple rounds of nuclear division within a membrane-bound parasitophorous vacuole (PV). 6The abbreviations used are: PVparasitophorous vacuolePVMparasitophorous vacuole membraneSLOstreptolysin OIFAimmunofluorescence analysisPDprodomain. Daughter merozoites eventually bud from the mature intracellular schizont then the enclosing PV membrane (PVM) and host cell membrane rupture in a process called egress to release the new generation of parasites. Numerous reports have shown that egress can be efficiently blocked by inhibitors of serine and cysteine proteases. As an example of the latter, treatment of mature Plasmodium falciparum schizonts with the epoxide trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E64), an inhibitor of cysteine proteases of the papain-like superfamily (MEROPS clan CA, family C1), results in “sacks” of mature merozoites that remain trapped within at least one bounding membrane (1Salmon B.L.

Of the nine P. falciparum SERA family members, SERA6, -7, and -8 possess a canonical Cys residue at the position of the active site nucleophile in their papain-like central domains. In the remaining P. falciparum SERAs this residue is replaced with a Ser. Importantly, gene disruption studies in P. falciparum have shown that only SERA5 (“Ser”-type) and the much less abundant SERA6 (“Cys”-type: P. falciparum 3D7 PlasmoDB ID PF3D7_0207500) are essential in asexual blood stages (12Miller S.K.

Despite this, there is no experimental evidence that SERA6 can mediate protease activity, and its physiological function remains unknown. Here we examine the importance and function of SERA6 and its proteolytic processing in the asexual blood-stage life cycle of the parasite. We first confirm that SERA6 localizes to the PV in P. falciparum and show that it is an authentic endogenous PfSUB1 substrate, being precisely cleaved by PfSUB1 at 3 positions at or around the time of egress. Using targeted homologous recombination, we demonstrate that the predicted catalytic Cys of SERA6 is required for asexual blood-stage P. falciparum viability, suggesting that SERA6 is an essential enzyme. We similarly show that mutations in SERA6 that block processing by PfSUB1 are not tolerated in the parasite, suggesting that the processing is important for SERA6 function. Finally, we demonstrate that cleavage by PfSUB1 of the P. berghei orthologue of SERA6 converts it to a form with protease activity. Our observations suggest that SERA6 may participate in an essential proteolytic pathway that is triggered by discharge of PfSUB1 into the PV just prior to egress. Recombinant PfSUB1 (rPfSUB1) was produced, purified, and quantified as described previously (10Withers-Martinez C. Suarez C. Fulle S. Kher S. Penzo M. Ebejer J.P. Koussis K. Hackett F. Jirgensons A.

Three regions of the P. falciparum SERA6 sequence were expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli SHuffle® T7 Express lysY competent cells (New England Biolabs) using a synthetic SERA6 gene (sera6synth; produced by Geneart AG), codon-optimized for expression in Pichia pastoris and based on the predicted P. falciparum FCBR SERA6 sequence reported by Knapp et al. (27Knapp B. Nau U. Hundt E. Küpper H.A. A new blood stage antigen of Plasmodium falciparum highly homologous to the serine-stretch protein SERP.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (PFASERP H, GenBankTM accession number M55428). This differs from the predicted 3D7 SERA6 primary sequence (PlasmoDB ID PF3D7_0207500) by just two substitutions, at P894T and N929D (the last residue in each case is the FCBR one). The sera6synth gene was provided as an insert with terminal AscI and PacI sites in pGA14. Polypeptides comprising SERA6 residues Asp371–Gln927 (called S6C1) and residues Ser928–Val1031 (called S6 C-term) were expressed with N-terminal hexahistidine (His6) and S-tags using the pEt-30Xa/LIC system (Invitrogen). S6C1 accumulated in insoluble inclusion bodies that were extensively washed, solubilized into 8 m urea in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and buffer exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). S6 C-term was expressed in soluble form and was purified by nickel-chelate chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen). The resin was washed in 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm arginine in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, then bound proteins were eluted using the same buffer containing 1 m arginine. Eluted fractions were dialyzed overnight against PBS at 4 °C. A third recombinant protein corresponding to SERA6 residues Gly35–Lys66 (called S6 N-term) was expressed with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tag using expression vector pGEX-SERA6 (a kind gift of Brendan Crabb, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Australia) and was affinity purified using glutathione-agarose (Sigma) as described previously (12Miller S.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47524-47532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Yields of the purified recombinant proteins were ∼20 mg/liter of E. coli culture (S6C1), ∼5 (S6 C-term) and ∼2 mg/liter (S6 N-term). The three purified polypeptides were used to immunize mice, and S6C1 was also used to immunize rabbits (performed by Harlan Laboratories, UK). Before use, all sera were adsorbed against E. coli acetone powder (40 mg/ml serum) to deplete antibodies against bacterial proteins. The synthetic sera6synth gene was also used to express a recombinant form of full-length P. falciparum SERA6 (minus its secretory signal peptide) called rSERA6wt (residues Glu23–Val1031), plus three processing site mutants in which residues Ala369–Gln370 (called rSERA6mutS1), or Gly926–Gln927 (rSERA6mutS2), or all four residues (rSERA6mutS1S2), were substituted with Leu by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II kit (Agilent Technologies) (see supplemental Table S1 for all oligonucleotide primers used in this study). All four recombinant proteins were expressed with N-terminal His and S-tags in the pEt-30Xa/LIC system (Invitrogen) in E. coli BL21-Gold DE3 cells (Stratagene). Purification and use of these proteins is described below. A central region of P. berghei ANKA PbSERA3 (PlasmodDB ID PBANKA_030490), the orthologue of P. falciparum SERA6 (9Arisue N. Kawai S. Hirai M. Palacpac N.M. Jia M. Kaneko A. Tanabe K. Horii T. Clues to evolution of the SERA multigene family in 18 Plasmodium species.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e17775Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), was expressed in E. coli using a synthetic pbsera3 gene (pbsera3synth; Geneart AG) codon-optimized for expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9, Invitrogen) cells. For this, PbSERA3 residues Ser425–Gln935 (called PbS3C1) were expressed with N-terminal His and S-tags using the pEt-30Xa/LIC system. PbS3C1 accumulated in insoluble inclusion bodies, which were washed, solubilized in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography, eluting with 8 m urea, 250 mm imidazole in 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 4. Yields of purified protein were ∼5 mg/liter of E. coli culture. The protein was buffer-exchanged into PBS and used to immunize mice. Prior to use, the resulting sera (anti-PbS3C1) were adsorbed against E. coli acetone powder to remove antibodies to bacterial contaminants. Full-length PbSERA3 and a PbSERA3 C641A mutant (called rPbSERA3 and rPbSERA3C641A) were expressed as secreted proteins in insect cells, using the pbsera3synth gene. Substitution of the predicted catalytic Cys641 codon in pbsera3synth with an Ala codon was performed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II, Agilent Technologies) using oligonucleotide primer PbSERA3_C/A_fwd (supplemental Table S1) and its complementary reverse primer. The pbsera3synth and pbsera3synthC641A coding sequences were introduced into the pFastBacTM vector (Invitrogen), and recombinant bacmid was prepared by site-directed transposition according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Bac-to-Bac® Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). Recombinant virus was generated by transfecting Sf9 cells with bacmid DNA. For recombinant protein production, High FiveTM cells (Invitrogen) grown in ESF 921 medium (Invitrogen) containing tunicamycin (Sigma; 0.5 μg ml−1) were infected with recombinant virus as described previously (26Withers-Martinez C. Saldanha J.W. Ely B. Hackett F. O'Connor T. Blackman M.J. Expression of recombinant Plasmodium falciparum subtilisin-like protease-1 in insect cells.

Accumulation of secreted recombinant protein was monitored by Western blot using the mouse anti-PbS3C1 antibodies or polyclonal mouse antibodies against PbSERA3 (kindly provided by Volker Heussler, University of Bern, Switzerland). Clarified culture supernatants were adjusted to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, applied to a HiPrep Q XL 16/10 anion exchange column (GE Healthcare), and bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. The peak containing rPbSERA3 or rPbSERA3C641A (which showed identical elution profiles) was pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12 mm CaCl2. Yields of purified protein were very low (∼2–10 μg/L insect cell supernatant). Purified protein was stored in aliquots at −70 °C until required. Plasmid constructs for modification of the P. falciparum sera6 locus by single crossover targeted homologous recombination were based on plasmid pHH-SERA6synth, which was in turn derived from the backbone of pHH1-ΔSERA4 (a kind gift of Brendan Crabb, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Australia). To generate pHH-SERA6synth, the promoter and 5′ coding region of the genomic sera6 gene (from 979 bp upstream of the translation start site to the middle of exon 2, 474 bp downstream of the translational start site) were amplified with primers SERA6_prom_fwd and SERA6_prom_rev (supplemental Table S1), digested with BglII and XhoI and ligated into similarly digested pHH1-ΔSERA4 in place of the SERA4 sequence. This placed it directly upstream of the P. berghei dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfrts) 3′ UTR, which regulates correct transcription termination and polyadenylation of the transcript, as described previously (6Yeoh S. O'Donnell R.A. Koussis K. Dluzewski A.R. Ansell K.H. Osborne S.A. Hackett F. Withers-Martinez C. Mitchell G.H. Bannister L.H. Bryans J.S. Kettleborough C.A. Blackman M.J.

The remainder of the SERA6 coding region (2406 bp) was then amplified from the recodonized sera6synth sequence using primers SERA6synth_fwd and SERA6synth_rev (supplemental Table S1), digested with XhoI at both ends, and ligated in-frame with the authentic sera6 sequence to generate a vector (pHH-SERA6synth) that encoded the complete sera6 sequence. The promoter and first 624 bp of the sera6synth sequence were then excised from pHH-SERA6synth using restriction enzymes BamHI and AleI, and replaced with a 921-bp region of genomic sera6 DNA sequence amplified with primers SERA6gen_homology_fwd and SERA6gen_homology_rev (supplemental Table S1). This extends from intron 1 to the region of genomic sequence corresponding to the AleI site in the sera6synth sequence. The resulting construct (pHH-SERA6chim) therefore contained a region of sera6 genomic DNA in-frame with the sera6synth sequence, but lacked a promoter and the"
https://openalex.org/W2066725077,"The inner mitochondrial membrane plays a crucial role in cellular lipid homeostasis through biosynthesis of the non-bilayer-forming lipids phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the majority of cellular phosphatidylethanolamine is synthesized by the mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1). The biogenesis of Psd1 involves several processing steps. It was speculated that the Psd1 precursor is sorted into the inner membrane and is subsequently released into the intermembrane space by proteolytic removal of a hydrophobic sorting signal. However, components involved in the maturation of the Psd1 precursor have not been identified. We show that processing of Psd1 involves the action of the mitochondrial processing peptidase and Oct1 and an autocatalytic cleavage at a highly conserved LGST motif yielding the α- and β-subunit of the enzyme. The Psd1 β-subunit (Psd1β) forms the membrane anchor, which binds the intermembrane space-localized α-subunit (Psd1α). Deletion of a transmembrane segment in the β-subunit results in mislocalization of Psd1 and reduced enzymatic activity. Surprisingly, autocatalytic cleavage does not depend on proper localization to the inner mitochondrial membrane. In summary, membrane integration of Psd1 is crucial for its functionality and for maintenance of mitochondrial lipid homeostasis."

Individual cells showed glycolytic oscillations even at very low cell densities (e.g. 1.0 x 10(5) cells/ml). By contrast, the collective behaviour on the population level was cell density-dependent: at high cell densities it is oscillatory, but below the threshold density of 1.0 x 10(6) cells/ml the collective dynamics becomes quiescent. We demonstrate that the transition in the collective dynamics is caused by the desynchronisation of the oscillations of individual cells. This is characteristic for a Kuramoto transition. Spatially resolved measurements at low cell densities revealed that even cells that adhere to their neighbours oscillated with their own, independent frequencies and phases."
https://openalex.org/W1970048613,Cooling Year-Round Ice cores from Greenland show that several abrupt cooling events occurred during the last glacial period and early Holocene—two of the most dramatic being the Younger Dryas [which lasted from around 12.9 to 11.7 thousand years ago (ka)] and 8.2-ka event (which began around 8200 years ago and lasted for ∼150 years). Wintertime temperatures in Greenland during the Younger Dryas seem to have been relatively lower than summertime temperatures although it is not clear if the 8.2-ka event experienced the same pattern of seasonal cooling. Young et al. (p. 1330 ) report observations of the positions of the leading edge of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and mountain glaciers on Baffin Island during the 8.2-ka event and find that mountain glaciers were larger than their predecessors during the Younger Dryas. It seems that cooling during the 8.2-ka event was more evenly distributed across the seasons than it was during that earlier cold period.
https://openalex.org/W2064428941,"The use of quantitative metrics to gauge the impact of scholarly publications, authors, and disciplines is predicated on the availability of reliable usage and annotation data. Citation and download counts are widely available from digital libraries. However, current annotation systems rely on proprietary labels, refer to journals but not articles or authors, and are manually curated. To address these limitations, we propose a social framework based on crowdsourced annotations of scholars, designed to keep up with the rapidly evolving disciplinary and interdisciplinary landscape. We describe a system called Scholarometer, which provides a service to scholars by computing citation-based impact measures. This creates an incentive for users to provide disciplinary annotations of authors, which in turn can be used to compute disciplinary metrics. We first present the system architecture and several heuristics to deal with noisy bibliographic and annotation data. We report on data sharing and interactive visualization services enabled by Scholarometer. Usage statistics, illustrating the data collected and shared through the framework, suggest that the proposed crowdsourcing approach can be successful. Secondly, we illustrate how the disciplinary bibliometric indicators elicited by Scholarometer allow us to implement for the first time a universal impact measure proposed in the literature. Our evaluation suggests that this metric provides an effective means for comparing scholarly impact across disciplinary boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2069579049,"The treatment of cancer such as oligonucleotides or peptides requires efficient delivery systems. A novel peptide, TMTP1, previously derived and identified in our laboratory showed remarkable ability to target highly metastatic tumors both in vitro and in vivo, even at the early stage of occult metastasis foci. TMTP1 moderately inhibited tumor cell viability, although not enough to deem it an efficient killer of tumor cells. In this study, we sought to enhance the anti-tumor activity of TMTP1. To do this, we fused it to an antimicrobial peptide, D(KLAKLAK)2, and termed the resulting peptide TMTP1-DKK. We found that TMTP1-DKK could trigger rapid apoptosis in human prostate and gastric cancer cells through both the mitochondrial-induced apoptosis pathway and the death receptor pathway. Furthermore, direct injection of TMTP1-DKK into mice with prostate and gastric xenograft cancers resulted in reduction of tumor volumes and a significant delay in tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. These results suggest that TMTP1-DKK may serve as a powerful therapeutic agent for metastatic tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1985007684,"Cellular responses to Bmp ligands are regulated at multiple levels, both extracellularly and intracellularly. Therefore, the presence of these growth factors is not an accurate indicator of Bmp signaling activity.

In order to provide a simpler readout system to examine the presence of Bmp signaling in developing animals, we developed BRE-gal mouse embryonic stem cells and a transgenic mouse line that specifically respond to Bmp ligand stimulation. Our reporter identifies specific transcriptional responses that are mediated by Smad1 and Smad4 with the Schnurri transcription factor complex binding to a conserved Bmp-Responsive Element (BRE), originally identified among Drosophila, Xenopus and human Bmp targets. Our BRE-gal mES cells specifically respond to Bmp ligands at concentrations as low as 5 ng/ml; and BRE-gal reporter mice, derived from the BRE-gal mES cells, show dynamic activity in many cellular sites, including extraembryonic structures and mammary glands, thereby making this a useful scientific tool."
https://openalex.org/W2010738219,"It is well established that EGFR signals from both the plasma membrane (PM) and endosome (EN). However, very little is known about whether and how the EGFR signals at the PM and EN to differentially regulate various signaling pathways and the physiological outcomes. In this communication, we established a system that allowed the specific activations of EGFR at different cell locations: PM and EN. PM activation of EGFR is achieved by activation of endocytosis-deficient mutant EGFR1010LL/AA stably expressed in CHO cells (CHO-LL/AA cell). EN activation of EGFR is achieved by activating the wild type EGFR stably expressed in CHO cells (CHO-EGFR cell) after its internalization into EN with a previously reported protocol. We showed that both EGFR activations at PM and EN activated ERK to a similar level, but differentially stimulated transcriptional factors c-jun and c-fos. We further showed that EGFR activations at PM and EN resulted in differential spatio-temporal dynamics of phosphorylated ERK which caused the differential activation of two downstream substrates ELK1 and RSK. Finally we showed that EGFR signaling from PM and EN led to different physiological outcomes. CHO-LL/AA cells that only generate PM EGFR signals have a larger cell size and slower proliferation rate than CHO-EGFR cells. We conclude that location-specific EGFR activation differentially regulates cell functions through a spatio-temporal interplay of ERK activation."
https://openalex.org/W1975202788,"Mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by depolarization of mitochondrial membranes and the initiation of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis are pathological responses to hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in the neonatal brain. Carnitine metabolism directly supports mitochondrial metabolism by shuttling long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane for beta-oxidation. Our previous studies have shown that HI disrupts carnitine homeostasis in neonatal rats and that L-carnitine can be neuroprotective. Thus, this study was undertaken to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which HI alters carnitine metabolism and to begin to elucidate the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of L-carnitine (LCAR) supplementation. Utilizing neonatal rat hippocampal slice cultures we found that oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) decreased the levels of free carnitines (FC) and increased the acylcarnitine (AC): FC ratio. These changes in carnitine homeostasis correlated with decreases in the protein levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) 1 and 2. LCAR supplementation prevented the decrease in CPT1 and CPT2, enhanced both FC and the AC∶FC ratio and increased slice culture metabolic viability, the mitochondrial membrane potential prior to OGD and prevented the subsequent loss of neurons during later stages of reperfusion through a reduction in apoptotic cell death. Finally, we found that LCAR supplementation preserved the structural integrity and synaptic transmission within the hippocampus after OGD. Thus, we conclude that LCAR supplementation preserves the key enzymes responsible for maintaining carnitine homeostasis and preserves both cell viability and synaptic transmission after OGD."
https://openalex.org/W1997849175,"Previous studies on European robins, Erithacus rubecula, and Australian silvereyes, Zosterops lateralis, had suggested that magnetic compass information is being processed only in the right eye and left brain hemisphere of migratory birds. However, recently it was demonstrated that both garden warblers, Sylvia borin, and European robins have a magnetic compass in both eyes. These results raise the question if the strong lateralization effect observed in earlier experiments might have arisen from artifacts or from differences in experimental conditions rather than reflecting a true all-or-none lateralization of the magnetic compass in European robins. Here we show that (1) European robins having only their left eye open can orient in their seasonally appropriate direction both during autumn and spring, i.e. there are no strong lateralization differences between the outward journey and the way home, that (2) their directional choices are based on the standard inclination compass as they are turned 180° when the inclination is reversed, and that (3) the capability to use the magnetic compass does not depend on monocular learning or intraocular transfer as it is already present in the first tests of the birds with only one eye open."
https://openalex.org/W2039301130,"The ability to regulate protein levels in live cells is crucial to understanding protein function. In the interest of advancing the tool set for protein perturbation, we developed a protein destabilizing domain (DD) that can confer its instability to a fused protein of interest. This destabilization and consequent degradation can be rescued in a reversible and dose-dependent manner with the addition of a small molecule that is specific for the DD, Shield-1. Proteins encounter different local protein quality control (QC) machinery when targeted to cellular compartments such as the mitochondrial matrix or endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These varied environments could have profound effects on the levels and regulation of the cytoplasmically derived DD. Here we show that DD fusions in the cytoplasm or nucleus can be efficiently degraded in mammalian cells; however, targeting fusions to the mitochondrial matrix or ER lumen leads to accumulation even in the absence of Shield-1. Additionally, we characterize the behavior of the DD with perturbants that modulate protein production, degradation, and local protein QC machinery. Chemical induction of the unfolded protein response in the ER results in decreased levels of an ER-targeted DD indicating the sensitivity of the DD to the degradation environment. These data reinforce that DD is an effective tool for protein perturbation, show that the local QC machinery affects levels of the DD, and suggest that the DD may be a useful probe for monitoring protein quality control machinery."

Electronic architectures for brain- machine interfaces must therefore minimize size and power consumption, while maximizing the ability to compress data to be transmitted over limited-bandwidth wireless channels. Here we present a system of extremely low computational complexity, designed for real-time decoding of neural signals, and suited for highly scalable implantable systems. Our programmable architecture is an explicit implementation of a universal computing machine emulating the dynamics of a network of integrate-and-fire neurons; it requires no arithmetic operations except for counting, and decodes neural signals using only computationally inexpensive logic operations. The simplicity of this architecture does not compromise its ability to compress raw neural data by factors greater than [Formula: see text]. We describe a set of decoding algorithms based on this computational architecture, one designed to operate within an implanted system, minimizing its power consumption and data transmission bandwidth; and a complementary set of algorithms for learning, programming the decoder, and postprocessing the decoded output, designed to operate in an external, nonimplanted unit. The implementation of the implantable portion is estimated to require fewer than 5000 operations per second. A proof-of-concept, 32-channel field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of this portion is consequently energy efficient. We validate the performance of our overall system by decoding electrophysiologic data from a behaving rodent."
https://openalex.org/W2086079362,"Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) is useful to establish transmission routes and sources of infections for various microorganisms including Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). The recently released SITVITWEB database contains 12-loci Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units – Variable Number of Tandem DNA Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) profiles and spoligotype patterns for thousands of MTC strains; it uses MIRU International Types (MIT) and Spoligotype International Types (SIT) to designate clustered patterns worldwide. Considering existing doubts on the ability of spoligotyping alone to reveal exact phylogenetic relationships between MTC strains, we developed a MLVA based classification for MTC genotypic lineages. We studied 6 different subsets of MTC isolates encompassing 7793 strains worldwide. Minimum spanning trees (MST) were constructed to identify major lineages, and the most common representative located as a central node was taken as the prototype defining different phylogenetic groups. A total of 7 major lineages with their respective prototypes were identified: Indo-Oceanic/MIT57, East Asian and African Indian/MIT17, Euro American/MIT116, West African-I/MIT934, West African-II/MIT664, M. bovis/MIT49, M.canettii/MIT60. Further MST subdivision identified an additional 34 sublineage MIT prototypes. The phylogenetic relationships among the 37 newly defined MIRU-VNTR lineages were inferred using a classification algorithm based on a bayesian approach. This information was used to construct an updated phylogenetic and phylogeographic snapshot of worldwide MTC diversity studied both at the regional, sub-regional, and country level according to the United Nations specifications. We also looked for IS6110 insertional events that are known to modify the results of the spoligotyping in specific circumstances, and showed that a fair portion of convergence leading to the currently observed bias in phylogenetic classification of strains may be traced back to the presence of IS6110. These results shed new light on the evolutionary history of the pathogen in relation to the history of peopling and human migration."
https://openalex.org/W2051201900,"Calcineurin B homologous proteins (CHP) are N-myristoylated, EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding proteins that regulate multiple cellular processes, including intracellular pH homeostasis. Previous work has shown that the heart-enriched isoform, CHP3, regulates the plasmalemmal Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE1 isoform by enhancing its rate of oligosaccharide maturation and exocytosis as well as its half-life and transport activity at the cell surface (Zaun, H. C., Shrier, A., and Orlowski, J. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 12456-12467). However, the molecular basis for this effect is not well understood. In this report, we investigated whether the N-myristoylation and Ca(2+)-binding domains of CHP3 are important elements for regulating NHE1. Mutation of residues essential for either N-myristoylation (G2A) or calcium binding (D123A) did not prevent the interaction of CHP3 with NHE1, although the D123A mutant no longer showed elevated binding to NHE1 in the presence of Ca(2+) when assessed using in vitro binding assays. Disruption of either site also did not impair the ability of CHP3 to stimulate the biosynthetic processing and trafficking of NHE1 to the plasma membrane nor did it affect the H(+) sensitivity of the exchanger. However, they did significantly reduce the cell surface half-life and near maximal transport velocity of NHE1 to a similar extent. Simultaneous mutation of both sites (G2A/D123A) gave results identical to the individual substitutions. This finding suggests that both domains in CHP3 are interdependent and may function cooperatively as a Ca(2+)-myristoyl switch mechanism to selectively stabilize the NHE1·CHP3 complex at the cell surface in a conformation that promotes optimal transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W2001437717,"S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) involved in storage and transport of nitric oxide ((•)NO) plays an important role in vascular homeostasis. Breakdown of GSNO can be catalyzed by γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). We investigated whether vascular GGT influences the vasorelaxant effect of GSNO in isolated rat aorta. Histochemical localization of GGT and measurement of its activity were performed by using chromogenic substrates in sections and in aorta homogenates, respectively. The role of GGT in GSNO metabolism was evaluated by measuring GSNO consumption rate (absorbance decay at 334 nm), (•)NO release was visualized and quantified with the fluorescent probe 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate. The vasorelaxant effect of GSNO was assayed using isolated rat aortic rings (in the presence or absence of endothelium). The role of GGT was assessed by stimulating enzyme activity with cosubstrate glycylglycine, as well as using two independent inhibitors, competitive serine borate complex and non-competitive acivicin. Specific GGT activity was histochemically localized in the endothelium. Consumption of GSNO and release of free (•)NO decreased and increased in presence of serine borate complex and glycylglycine, respectively. In vasorelaxation experiments with endothelium-intact aorta, the half maximal effective concentration of GSNO (EC50 = 3.2 ± 0.5.10(-7) M) increased in the presence of the two distinct GGT inhibitors, serine borate complex (1.6 ± 0.2.10(-6) M) and acivicin (8.3 ± 0.6.10(-7) M), while it decreased with glycylglycine (4.7 ± 0.9.10(-8) M). In endothelium-denuded aorta, EC(50) for GSNO alone increased to 2.3 ± 0.3.10(-6) M, with no change in the presence of serine borate complex. These data demonstrate the important role of endothelial GGT activity in mediating the vasorelaxant effect of GSNO in rat aorta under physiological conditions. Because therapeutic treatments based on GSNO are presently under development, this endothelium-dependent mechanism involved in the vascular effects of GSNO should be taken into account in a pharmacological perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2086685964,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 is a Gram-negative soil bacterium capable of inducing tumors (crown galls) on many dicotyledonous plants. The genome of A. tumefaciens strain C58 was re-annotated based on the Z-curve method. First, all the 'hypothetical genes' were re-identified, and 29 originally annotated 'hypothetical genes' were recognized to be non-coding open reading frames (ORFs). Theoretical evidence obtained from principal component analysis, clusters of orthologous groups of proteins occupation, and average length distribution showed that these non-coding ORFs were highly unlikely to encode proteins. Results from the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments on three different growth stages of A. tumefaciens C58 confirmed that 23 (79%) of the identified non-coding ORFs have no transcripts in these growth stages. In addition, using theoretical prediction, 19 potential protein-coding genes were predicted to be new protein-coding genes. Fifteen (79%) of these genes were verified with RT-PCR experiments. The RT-PCR experimental results confirmed the reliability of our theoretical prediction, indicating that false-positive prediction and missing genes always exist in the annotation of A. tumefaciens C58 genome. The improved annotation will serve as a valuable resource for the research of the lifestyle, metabolism, and pathogenicity of A. tumefaciens C58. The re-annotation of A. tumefaciens C58 can be obtained from http://211.69.128.148/Atum/."
https://openalex.org/W2142795459,"Intracranial electrocortical recording and stimulation can provide unique knowledge about functional brain anatomy in patients undergoing brain surgery. This approach is commonly used in the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy. However, it can be very difficult to integrate the results of cortical recordings with other brain mapping modalities, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The ability to integrate imaging and electrophysiological information with simultaneous subdural electrocortical recording/stimulation and fMRI could offer significant insight for cognitive and systems neuroscience as well as for clinical neurology, particularly for patients with epilepsy or functional disorders. However, standard subdural electrodes cause significant artifact in MRI images, and concerns about risks such as cortical heating have generally precluded obtaining MRI in patients with implanted electrodes. We propose an electrode set based on polymer thick film organic substrate (PTFOS), an organic absorbable, flexible and stretchable electrode grid for intracranial use. These new types of MRI transparent intracranial electrodes are based on nano-particle ink technology that builds on our earlier development of an EEG/fMRI electrode set for scalp recording. The development of MRI-compatible recording/stimulation electrodes with a very thin profile could allow functional mapping at the individual subject level of the underlying feedback and feed forward networks. The thin flexible substrate would allow the electrodes to optimally contact the convoluted brain surface. Performance properties of the PTFOS were assessed by MRI measurements, finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, micro-volt recording, and injecting currents using standard electrocortical stimulation in phantoms. In contrast to the large artifacts exhibited with standard electrode sets, the PTFOS exhibited no artifact due to the reduced amount of metal and conductivity of the electrode/trace ink and had similar electrical properties to a standard subdural electrode set. The enhanced image quality could enable routine MRI exams of patients with intracranial electrode implantation and could also lead to chronic implantation solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2064991185,"Bunchgrasses are one of the most important plant functional groups in grassland ecosystems. Reproductive allocation (RA) for a bunchgrass is a hierarchical process; however, how bunchgrasses adjust their RAs along hierarchical levels in response to nutrient addition has never been addressed. Here, utilizing an 11-year nutrient addition experiment, we examined the patterns and variations in RA of Agropyron cristatum at the individual, tiller and spike levels. We evaluated the reproductive allometric relationship at each level by type II regression analysis to determine size-dependent and size-independent effects on plant RA variations. Our results indicate that the proportion of reproductive individuals in A. cristatum increased significantly after 11 years of nutrient addition. Adjustments in RA in A. cristatum were mainly occurred at the individual and tiller levels but not at the spike level. A size-dependent effect was a dominant mechanism underlying the changes in plant RA at both individual and tiller levels. Likewise, the distribution of plant size was markedly changed with large individuals increasing after nutrient addition. Tiller-level RA may be a limiting factor for the adjustment of RA in A. cristatum. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine plant responses in terms of reproductive allocation and allometry to nutrient enrichment within a bunchgrass population from a hierarchical view. Our findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying bunchgrass responses in RA to future eutrophication due to human activities. In addition, we developed a hierarchical analysis method for disentangling the mechanisms that lead to variation in RA for perennial bunchgrasses."
https://openalex.org/W2065813563,"Sex steroids have direct effects on the skeleton. Estrogen acts on the skeleton via the classical genomic estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERα and ERβ), a membrane ER, and the non-genomic G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). GPER is distributed throughout the nervous system, but little is known about its effects on bone. In male rats, adaptation to loading is neuronally regulated, but this has not been studied in females.We used the rat ulna end-loading model to induce an adaptive modeling response in ovariectomized (OVX) female Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were treated with a placebo, estrogen (17β-estradiol), or G-1, a GPER-specific agonist. Fourteen days after OVX, rats underwent unilateral cyclic loading of the right ulna; half of the rats in each group had brachial plexus anesthesia (BPA) of the loaded limb before loading. Ten days after loading, serum estrogen concentrations, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) gene expression of ERα, ERβ, GPER, CGRPα, TRPV1, TRPV4 and TRPA1, and load-induced skeletal responses were quantified. We hypothesized that estrogen and G-1 treatment would influence skeletal responses to cyclic loading through a neuronal mechanism. We found that estrogen suppresses periosteal bone formation in female rats. This physiological effect is not GPER-mediated. We also found that absolute mechanosensitivity in female rats was decreased, when compared with male rats. Blocking of adaptive bone formation by BPA in Placebo OVX females was reduced.Estrogen acts to decrease periosteal bone formation in female rats in vivo. This effect is not GPER-mediated. Gender differences in absolute bone mechanosensitivity exist in young Sprague-Dawley rats with reduced mechanosensitivity in females, although underlying bone formation rate associated with growth likely influences this observation. In contrast to female and male rats, central neuronal signals had a diminished effect on adaptive bone formation in estrogen-deficient female rats."
https://openalex.org/W2067354812,"Since 2004 it become clear that atypical bovine spongiform encephalopthies (BSEs) exist in cattle. Whenever their detection has relied on active surveillance plans implemented in Europe since 2001 by rapid tests, the overall and inter-laboratory performance of these diagnostic systems in the detection of the atypical strains has not been studied thoroughly to date. To fill this gap, the present study reports on the analytical sensitivity of the EU-approved rapid tests for atypical L- and H-type and classical BSE in parallel. Each test was challenged with two dilution series, one created from a positive pool of the three BSE forms according to the EURL standard method of homogenate preparation (50% w/v) and the other as per the test kit manufacturer's instructions. Multilevel logistic models and simple logistic models with the rapid test as the only covariate were fitted for each BSE form analyzed as directed by the test manufacturer's dilution protocol. The same schemes, but excluding the BSE type, were then applied to compare test performance under the manufacturer's versus the water protocol. The IDEXX HerdChek ® BSE-scrapie short protocol test showed the highest sensitivity for all BSE forms. The IDEXX® HerdChek BSE-scrapie ultra short protocol, the Prionics® - Check WESTERN and the AJ Roboscreen® BetaPrion tests showed similar sensitivities, followed by the Roche® PrionScreen, the Bio-Rad® TeSeE™ SAP and the Prionics® - Check PrioSTRIP in descending order of analytical sensitivity. Despite these differences, the limit of detection of all seven rapid tests against the different classes of material set within a 2 log10 range of the best-performing test, thus meeting the European Food Safety Authority requirement for BSE surveillance purposes. These findings indicate that not many atypical cases would have been missed surveillance since 2001 which is important for further epidemiological interpretations of the sporadic character of atypical forms."
https://openalex.org/W1965485763,"Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) improves motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), but can exert detrimental effects on impulsivity. These effects are especially related to the inability to slow down when high-conflict choices have to be made. However, the influence that DBS has on delay aversion is still under-investigated. Here, we tested a group of 21 PD patients on and off stimulation (off medication) by using the Cambridge Gamble Task (CGT), a computerized task that allows the investigation of risk-related behaviours and delay aversion, and psychological questionnaires such as the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), the Sensitivity to Punishment and to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ), and the Quick Delay Questionnaire (QDQ). We found that delay aversion scores on the CGT were no higher when patients were on stimulation as compared to when they were off stimulation. In contrast, PD patients reported feeling more impulsive in the off stimulation state, as revealed by significantly higher scores on the BIS. Higher scores on the sensitivity to punishment subscale of the SPSRQ highlighted that possible punishments influence patients' behaviours more than possible rewards. Significant correlations between delay aversion scores on the CGT and QDQ delay aversion subscale suggest that these two instruments can be used in synergy to reach a convergent validity. In conclusion, our results show that not all impulsivities are detrimentally affected by DBS of the STN and that the joint use of experimental paradigms and psychological questionnaires can provide useful insights in the study of impulsivity."
https://openalex.org/W2120033151,"Schwann cell (SC) transplantation is currently being discussed as a strategy that may promote functional recovery in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). However this assumes they will not only survive but also remyelinate demyelinated axons in the chronically inflamed CNS. To address this question we investigated the fate of transplanted SCs in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the Dark Agouti rat; an animal model that reproduces the complex inflammatory demyelinating immunopathology of MS. We now report that SCs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP-SCs) allografted after disease onset not only survive but also migrate to remyelinate lesions in the inflamed CNS. GFP-SCs were detected more frequently in the parenchyma after direct injection into the spinal cord, than via intra-thecal delivery into the cerebrospinal fluid. In both cases the transplanted cells intermingled with astrocytes in demyelinated lesions, aligned with axons and by twenty one days post transplantation had formed Pzero protein immunoreactive internodes. Strikingly, GFP-SCs transplantation was associated with marked decrease in clinical disease severity in terms of mortality; all GFP-SCs transplanted animals survived whilst 80% of controls died within 40 days of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2036553744,"Humans with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) or ocular albinism (OA1) display abnormal aspects of organelle biogenesis. The multigenic disorder HPS displays broad defects in biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles including melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes. A phenotype of ocular pigmentation in OA1 is a smaller number of macromelanosomes, in contrast to HPS, where in many cases the melanosomes are smaller than normal. In these studies we define the role of the Mreg(dsu) gene, which suppresses the coat color dilution of Myo5a, melanophilin, and Rab27a mutant mice in maintaining melanosome size and distribution. We show that the product of the Mreg(dsu) locus, melanoregulin (MREG), interacts both with members of the HPS BLOC-2 complex and with Oa1 in regulating melanosome size. Loss of MREG function facilitates increase in the size of micromelanosomes in the choroid of the HPS BLOC-2 mutants ruby, ruby2, and cocoa, while a transgenic mouse overexpressing melanoregulin corrects the size of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) macromelanosomes in Oa1(ko/ko) mice. Collectively, these results suggest that MREG levels regulate pigment incorporation into melanosomes. Immunohistochemical analysis localizes melanoregulin not to melanosomes, but to small vesicles in the cytoplasm of the RPE, consistent with a role for this protein in regulating membrane interactions during melanosome biogenesis. These results provide the first link between the BLOC pathway and Oa1 in melanosome biogenesis, thus supporting the hypothesis that intracellular G-protein coupled receptors may be involved in the biogenesis of other organelles. Furthermore these studies provide the foundation for therapeutic approaches to correct the pigment defects in the RPE of HPS and OA1."
https://openalex.org/W2082176597,"We describe the application of a novel HIV confirmatory testing algorithm to determine the primary efficacy endpoint in a large Phase III microbicide trial. 9385 women were enrolled between 2005 and 2009. Of these women, 537 (6%) had at least one positive HIV rapid test after enrolment. This triggered the use of the algorithm which made use of archived serum and Buffy Coat samples. The overall sample set was >95% complete. 419 (78%) of the rapid test positive samples were confirmed as primary endpoints using a combination of assays for the detection of HIV-specific antibodies (EIA's and Western Blot), and for components of the virus itself (PCR for the detection of nucleic acids and EIA for p24 antigen). 63 (12%) cases were confirmed as being HIV-positive at screening or enrolment and 55 (10%) were confirmed as HIV negative. The testing algorithm confirmed the endpoint at the same visit as that of the first positive rapid test in 90% of cases and at the time of the preceding visit in 10% of cases. Of the 63 cases which were subsequently confirmed to be HIV-1 positive at or before enrolment, 54 specimens contained no detectable HIV antibodies at screening or enrolment. However, 43 were positive using an EIA which detects both HIV antigen and antibody and also had a positive p24 antigen or HIV PCR test, which was highly suggestive of acute infection. There were 6 unusual cases which had undetectable HIV-1 DNA or RNA. In 4 of the 6 cases the presence of HIV-1-specific antibodies was confirmed by Western Blot. One of these cases with an indeterminate Western Blot was a previous vaccine trial participant. The algorithm served the objectives of the study well and can be recommended for use in determining HIV as an endpoint in clinical trials.ISRCTN.org ISRCTN 64716212."
https://openalex.org/W2073762427,"Observations of cooperation range from human philanthropy to fiddler crabs leaving their territories to help neighbors thwart an intruder ( 1 ). Two of the best-known explanations for such cooperation are direct reciprocity ( 2 ), in which cooperation evolves as a conditional strategy over repeated interactions, and population structuring ( 3 ), in which cooperators associate disproportionately with cooperators. However, many systems have the potential to generate cooperation through both of these routes; for example, common murres (see the figure) regularly preen both their mates and close colony neighbors over repeated interactions. How might these routes to cooperation interact? In a recent paper, van Veelen et al. ( 4 ) consider this question in a systematic way. Their answer is unexpected."
https://openalex.org/W2014609814,"While the profiling of subtypes of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) have been the subject of considerable scrutiny, both psychometrically and psychophysiologically, little attention has been paid to the effect of diagnoses comorbid with AD/HD on such profiles. This is despite the greater than 80% prevalence of comorbidity under the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic definitions. Here we investigate the event related potential (ERP) and psychometric profiles of Controls, AD/HD, and comorbid AD/HD (particularly AD/HD+ODD/CD) groups on six neurocognitive tasks thought to probe the constructs of selective and sustained attention, response inhibition and executive function. Data from 29 parameters extracted from a child group (age range 6 to 12; 52 Controls and 64 AD/HD) and from an adolescent group (age range 13 to 17; 79 Controls and 88 AD/HD) were reduced via a Principal Components Analysis, the 6 significant eigenvectors then used as determinants of cluster membership via a Two-Step Cluster Analysis. Two clusters were found in the analysis of the adolescent age group - a cluster dominated by Control and AD/HD participants without comorbidity, while the second cluster was dominated by AD/HD participants with externalising comorbidity (largely oppositional defiant/conduct disorder ODD/CD). A similar segregation within the child age group was not found. Further analysis of these objectively determined clusters in terms of their clinical diagnoses indicates a significant effect of ODD/CD comorbidity on a concurrent AD/HD diagnosis. We conclude that comorbid externalising behaviour in AD/HD constitutes a distinct pathological entity in adolescence."

https://openalex.org/W2006423197,"A major goal of bioinformatics is the characterization of transcription factors and the transcriptional programs they regulate. Given the speed of genome sequencing, we would like to quickly annotate regulatory sequences in newly-sequenced genomes. In such cases, it would be helpful to predict sequence motifs by using experimental data from closely related model organism. Here we present a general algorithm that allow to identify transcription factor binding sites in one newly sequenced species by performing Bayesian regression on the annotated species. First we set the rationale of our method by applying it within the same species, then we extend it to use data available in closely related species. Finally, we generalise the method to handle the case when a certain number of experiments, from several species close to the species on which to make inference, are available. In order to show the performance of the method, we analyse three functionally related networks in the Ascomycota. Two gene network case studies are related to the G2/M phase of the Ascomycota cell cycle; the third is related to morphogenesis. We also compared the method with MatrixReduce and discuss other types of validation and tests. The first network is well known and provides a biological validation test of the method. The two cell cycle case studies, where the gene network size is conserved, demonstrate an effective utility in annotating new species sequences using all the available replicas from model species. The third case, where the gene network size varies among species, shows that the combination of information is less powerful but is still informative. Our methodology is quite general and could be extended to integrate other high-throughput data from model organisms."
