https://openalex.org/W2940133868,"Background 
Growing physician maldistribution and population demographic shifts have contributed to large geographic variation in healthcare access and the emergence of advanced practice providers as contributors to the healthcare workforce. Current estimates of geographic accessibility of physicians and advanced practice providers rely on outdated “provider per capita” estimates that have shortcomings.


Purpose 
To apply state of the art methods to estimate spatial accessibility of physician and non-physician clinician groups and to examine factors associated with higher accessibility.


Methods 
We used a combination of provider location, medical claims, and U.S. Census data to perform a national study of health provider accessibility. The National Plan and Provider Enumeration System was used along with Medicare claims to identify providers actively caring for patients in 2014 including: primary care physicians (i.e., internal medicine and family medicine), specialists, nurse practitioners, and chiropractors. For each U.S. ZIP code tabulation area, we estimated provider accessibility using the Variable-distance Enhanced 2 step Floating Catchment Area method and performed a Getis-Ord Gi* analysis for each provider group. Generalized linear models were used to examine associations between population characteristics and provider accessibility.


Results 
National spatial patterns of the provider groups differed considerably. Accessibility of internal medicine most resembled specialists with high accessibility in urban locales, whereas relative higher accessibility of family medicine physicians was concentrated in the upper Midwest. In our adjusted analyses independent factors associated with higher accessibility were very similar between internal medicine physicians and specialists–presence of a medical school in the county was associated with approximately 70% higher accessibility and higher accessibility was associated with urban locales. Nurse practitioners were similar to family medicine physicians with both having higher accessibility in rural locales.


Conclusions 
The Variable-distance Enhanced 2 step Floating Catchment Area method is a viable approach to measure spatial accessibility at the national scale."

A vaccine for infants has been compulsory since 1989, whereas those born before 1989 need to spend their own money to be vaccinated in private clinics or hospitals. The aim of this study was to investigate and ascertain the determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) for adult hepatitis B vaccine in Selangor, Malaysia.In 2016, 728 households were selected through a stratified, two stage cluster sample and interviewed. Willingness to pay for hepatitis B vaccine was estimated using the Contingent Valuation Method, and factors affecting WTP were modelled with logit regression.We found that 273 (37.5%) of the households were willing to pay for hepatitis B vaccination. The mean and median of WTP was estimated at Ringgit Malaysia (RM)303 (approximately US$73) for the three dose series. The estimated WTP was significantly greater in those with higher levels of education, among Malays and Chinese (compared to others, predominantly Indians), and for those with greater perceived susceptibility to hepatitis B virus infection. Other factors-perceived severity, barriers, benefits and cues to action-were not significantly associated with WTP for adult hepatitis B vaccination.Additional resources are needed to cover the households that are not willing to pay for hepatitis B vaccination. More awareness (particularly in regards to hepatitis B virus susceptibility) could change the national perception towards self-paid hepatitis B virus vaccination and increase hepatitis B vaccine coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2952150493,"The global downregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is emerging as a common hallmark of cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well known. We identified that the oncogenic miR-146b-5p attenuates miRNA biosynthesis by targeting DICER1 and reducing its expression. DICER1 overexpression inhibited all the miR-146b-induced aggressive phenotypes in thyroid cells. Systemic injection of an anti-miR-146b in mice with orthotopic thyroid tumors suppressed tumor growth and recovered DICER1 levels. Notably, DICER1 downregulation promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through miRNA downregulation. Our analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed a general decrease in DICER1 expression in thyroid cancer that was associated with a worse clinical outcome. Administration of the small-molecule enoxacin to promote DICER1 complex activity reduced tumor aggressiveness both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our data confirm DICER1 as a tumor suppressor and show that oncogenic miR-146b contributes to its downregulation. Moreover, our results highlight a potential therapeutic application of RNA-based therapies including miRNA inhibitors and restoration of the biogenesis machinery, which may provide treatments for thyroid and other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2936909840,"Among the most widespread plant species with clonal reproduction Arundo donax L. represents one of most studied one characterized by very low genetic biodiversity. Although it is a perennial rhizomatous tall grass native to eastern and southern Asia, it spreads only asexually in the invaded range all over the world thriving very well in a large array of pedo-climatic conditions. This ability to morphologically or physiologically adapt to a broad array of conditions could be attributed to epigenetic mechanisms. To shade light on this relevant issue, 96 stems of A. donax from spontaneous populations distributed across the Italian invaded range (island of Sardinia, Northern and Southern Italy) were analysed. Leaf DNAs were extracted and processed through AFLPs and MSAPs for defining either genetic and epigenetic profiles. Both analyses clearly showed that the A. donax populations of Sardinia island are genetically distinct from those of Italian mainland; AFLPs showed an extremely low genetic biodiversity due to vegetative reproduction, whilst, epi-biodiversity, estimated through MSAP marker, increased within the analyzed populations. These results suggest that the capability of A. donax to invade and thrive in diverse environmental conditions can be, at least, partially attributed to a higher epigenetic variability. Therefore, the different DNA methylation status may have significant and important biological meaning, in particular, in the case of invasive clonal plants such as A. donax, also for the biodiversity definition, and MSAP marker can be considered an useful and cost effective marker to reveal it."

Therefore, the laboratory experiments based on the analysis of the air in the vicinity of fungal isolates potentially found in the building materials were performed. The results revealed that the employed gas sensors array consisting of MOS-type sensors enables the detection of the differences among the examined samples of fungi and distinguishing between the non-contaminated and contaminated samples, shortly after fungal contamination occurs. Electronic nose readouts were analysed using Principal Component Analysis and the results were verified with standard chromatographic analysis by means of SPME-GC/MS method, which proved that gas sensors array can be applied for early detection of fungal contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2938288313,"Cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) has been investigated with promising results for peri-implant diseases treatment. However, prior to in-vivo applications of CAP sources in humans, short-term harmful mucosal damage or other unwanted side effects have to be reviewed. 180 male mice (B6C3F1) were divided into twelve treatment groups (n = 15). The right buccal cheek mucosa was treated with CAP. The first and second group each received continuous 10 sec irradiation with 2 different plasma sources (kINPen09, PS-MWM). The third group was treated with the kINPen09 for one minute. Control groups were treated with a corresponding dose of ultraviolet light for 8 seconds or 48 seconds and the other one was left untreated. The animals were weighed before and after treatment. The animals were sacrificed one day or one week after exposure. Stained tissue samples were histologically examined for tissue damage independently by two experienced pathologists. One day after CAP treatment histological analysis showed focal mucosal erosion with superficial ulceration and necrosis accompanied by a mild inflammatory reaction. One week after CAP treatment, the mucosal defects were completely re-epithelialized, associated with remnants of granulation tissue in the stroma irrespective of treatment duration. Furthermore, no cytological atypia was found and no severe weight loss occurred. The control groups did not show any alterations at all. CAP treatment led to a superficial mucosal damage that healed within few days. Nonetheless, further long-term experiments are necessary to exclude undesirable side effects after longer observation time. Particularly, potential carcinogenic effects must be ruled out prior to the application of CAP treatment in daily dental practice."
https://openalex.org/W2938253339,"Poultry by-product meal (PBM) has been utilised as a substitute of fishmeal (FM) in many aquaculture species. However, little information is known regarding the use of bioprocessed PBM (BPBM) in aquaculture production. This study was undertaken to investigate whether replacing FM with BPBM improved growth performance, gut morphology and fatty acid synthesis of juvenile barramundi, Lates calcarifer. The PBM was bioprocessed by baker yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisae and Lactobacillus casei. The BPBM was used to replace FM at 75% and 100% (75BPBM and 100BPBM) contrasting against unprocessed PBM (75PBM and 100PBM) at the same levels and FM based diets as the control. Juvenile barramundi with a mean initial weight of 3.78±0.16 g were stocked at a density of 20 fish per tank. After the 42 days of study, the final weight, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratios of fish fed 75PBM and 75BPBM were not significantly different from the control. However, 100% supplementation diets of 100PBM and 100BPBM resulted in reduced performance in all growth and feed variables except total feed intake and survival. The hind gut microvillus density was significantly higher (P<0.05) in fish fed 75BPBM, whereas the microvillus diameter remained unaffected with the other experimental diets when compared to the control. A reduction in eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids of fish muscles led to a lower Σn-3/Σn-6 ratio in all dietary groups when compared to the control. The percentage of Σn-3 PUFAs decreased in 100% FM replacement diets of 100PBM and 100BPBM, while Σn-6 PUFAs increased when both bioprocessed and unprocessed PBM protein was increased in the diets. Fish fed bioprocessed diets had higher fatty acid hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratios (HH), indicating improved suitability for human consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2938641297,"Bats are implicated as natural reservoirs for a wide range of zoonotic viruses including SARS and MERS coronaviruses, Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, Hendra, Rabies and other lyssaviruses. Accordingly, many One Health surveillance and viral discovery programs have focused on bats. In this report we present viral metagenomic data from bats collected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [KSA]. Unbiased high throughput sequencing of fecal samples from 72 bat individuals comprising four species; lesser mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma hardwickii), Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus), straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), and Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) revealed molecular evidence of a diverse set of viral families: Picornaviridae (hepatovirus, teschovirus, parechovirus), Reoviridae (rotavirus), Polyomaviridae (polyomavirus), Papillomaviridae (papillomavirus), Astroviridae (astrovirus), Caliciviridae (sapovirus), Coronaviridae (coronavirus), Adenoviridae (adenovirus), Paramyxoviridae (paramyxovirus), and unassigned mononegavirales (chuvirus). Additionally, we discovered a bastro-like virus (Middle East Hepe-Astrovirus), with a genomic organization similar to Hepeviridae. However, since it shared homology with Hepeviridae and Astroviridae at ORF1 and in ORF2, respectively, the newly discovered Hepe-Astrovirus may represent a phylogenetic bridge between Hepeviridae and Astroviridae."
https://openalex.org/W2936339071,"Objective The aims were to review practices concerning Differential Item Functioning (DIF) detection in composite measurement scales, particularly those used in health research, and to provide guidance on how to proceed if statistically significant DIF is detected. Methods This work specifically addressed the Rasch model which is the subject of growing interest in the field of health owing to its particularly advantageous properties. There were three steps: 1) Literature review to describe current practices; 2) Simulation study to determine under which conditions encountered in health research studies can erroneous conclusions be drawn from group comparisons when a scale is affected by DIF but which is not considered; 3) Based on steps 1 and 2, formulation of recommendations that were subsequently reviewed by leading internationally recognized experts. Results Four key recommendations were formulated to help researchers to determine whether statistically significant DIF is meaningful in practice, according to the kind of DIF (uniform or non-uniform) and the DIF effect size. Conclusion This work provides the first recommendations on how to deal in practice with the presence of DIF in composite measurement scales used in health research studies."
https://openalex.org/W2937107674,"Inflammatory and oncogenic signaling converge in disease evolution of BCR–ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms, clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by gain-of-function mutation in JAK2 kinase (JAK2V617F), with highest prevalence in patients with polycythemia vera (PV). Despite the high risk, DNA-damaging inflammatory microenvironment, PV progenitors tend to preserve their genomic stability over decades until their progression to post-PV myelofibrosis/acute myeloid leukemia. Using induced pluripotent stem cells-derived CD34+ progenitor-enriched cultures from JAK2V617F+ PV patient and from JAK2 wild-type healthy control, CRISPR-modified HEL cells and patients’ bone marrow sections from different disease stages, we demonstrate that JAK2V617F induces an intrinsic IFNγ- and NF-κB-associated inflammatory program, while suppressing inflammation-evoked DNA damage both in vitro and in vivo. We show that cells with JAK2V617F tightly regulate levels of inflammatory cytokines-induced reactive oxygen species, do not fully activate the ATM/p53/p21waf1 checkpoint and p38/JNK MAPK stress pathway signaling when exposed to inflammatory cytokines, suppress DNA single-strand break repair genes’ expression yet overexpress the dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) 1. RNAi-mediated knock-down and pharmacological inhibition of DUSP1, involved in p38/JNK deactivation, in HEL cells reveals growth addiction to DUSP1, consistent with enhanced DNA damage response and apoptosis in DUSP1-inhibited parental JAK2V617F+ cells, but not in CRISPR-modified JAK2 wild-type cells. Our results indicate that the JAK2V617F+ PV progenitors utilize DUSP1 activity as a protection mechanism against DNA damage accumulation, promoting their proliferation and survival in the inflammatory microenvironment, identifying DUSP1 as a potential therapeutic target in PV."
https://openalex.org/W2937676480,"Introduction Increased mobile phone subscribership in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) provides novel opportunities to track population health. The objective of this study was to examine reliability of data in comparing participant responses collected using two mobile phone survey (MPS) delivery modalities, computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and interactive voice response (IVR) in Bangladesh (BGD) and Tanzania (TZA). Methods Using a cross-over design, we used random digit dialing (RDD) to call randomly generated mobile phone numbers and recruit survey participants to receive either a CATI or IVR survey on non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors, followed 7 days later by the survey mode not received during first contact; either IVR or CATI. Respondents who received the first survey were designated as first contact (FC) and those who consented to being called a second time and subsequently answered the call were designated as follow-up (FU). We used the same questionnaire for both contacts, with response options modified to suit the delivery mode. Reliability of responses was analyzed using the Cohen’s kappa statistic for percent agreement between two modes. Results Self-reported data on demographic characteristics and NCD behavioral risk factors were collected from 482 (CATI-FC) and 653 (IVR-FC) age-eligible and consenting respondents in BGD, and from 387 (CATI-FC) and 674 (IVR-FC) respondents in TZA respectively. Survey follow-up rates were 30.7% (n = 482) for IVR-FU and 53.8% (n = 653) for CATI-FU in BGD; and 42.4% (n = 387) for IVR-FU and 49.9% (n = 674) for CATI-FU in TZA respectively. Overall, there was high consistency between delivery modalities for alcohol consumption in the past 30 days in both countries (kappa = 0.64 for CATI→IVR (BGD), kappa = 0.54 for IVR→CATI (BGD); kappa = 0.66 for CATI→IVR (TZA), kappa = 0.76 for IVR→CATI (TZA)), and current smoking (kappa = 0.68 for CATI→IVR (BGD), kappa = 0.69 for IVR→CATI (BGD); kappa = 0.39 for CATI→IVR (TZA), kappa = 0.50 for IVR→CATI (TZA)). There was moderate to substantial consistency in both countries for history of checking for hypertension and diabetes with kappa statistics ranging from 0.43 to 0.67. There was generally lower consistency in both countries for physical activity (vigorous and moderate) with kappa statistics ranging from 0.10 to 0.41, weekly fruit and vegetable with kappa ranging from 0.08 to 0.45, consumption of foods high in salt and efforts to limit salt with kappa generally below 0.3. Conclusions The study found that when respondents are re-interviewed, the reliability of answers to most demographic and NCD variables is similar whether starting with CATI or IVR. The study underscores the need for caution when selecting questions for mobile phone surveys. Careful design can help ensure clarity of questions to minimize cognitive burden for respondents, many of whom may not have prior experience in taking automated surveys. Further research should explore possible differences and determinants of survey reliability between delivery modes and ideally compare both IVR and CATI surveys to in-person face-to-face interviews. In addition, research is needed to better understand factors that influence survey cooperation, completion, refusal and attrition rates across populations and contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2939109551,"The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of bile acid–activated transcription factors and an important regulator of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and Wnt signaling. Down-regulated expression of FXR plays an important role in some malignancies such as colon cancer, and in rodent models of intestinal neoplasia, FXR knockout increases the size and number of colon tumors. These previous observations implicate FXR as a tumor suppressor, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Employing complementary experimental approaches and using human colon cancer specimens, human and murine colon cancer cell lines, and FXR transgenic mice, here we identified an additional, potentially important role for FXR. We observed an inverse relationship between the expression of FXR and matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7), a collagenase and signaling molecule consistently associated with colon cancer progression. We noted that FXR gene ablation increases MMP7 expression. Consistent with this finding, FXR overexpression and a dominant-negative FXR mutation reduced and augmented, respectively, MMP7 expression. Of note, MMP7 was the only MMP gene family member whose expression was down-regulated after FXR activation. FXR-mediated regulation of MMP7 transcription did not require heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), indicating that FXR represses MMP7 expression independently of RXR. Last, we uncovered that FXR suppresses MMP7 transcription by binding to a negative FXR-responsive element in the 5′ MMP7 promoter, an event that inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and invasion. These findings identify the FXR-MMP7 axis as a potential therapeutic target for managing colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2939239217,"The MST1R (RON) kinase is overexpressed in >80% of human pancreatic cancers, but its role in pancreatic carcinogenesis is unknown. In this study, we examined the relevance of Mst1r kinase to Kras driven pancreatic carcinogenesis using genetically engineered mouse models. In the setting of mutant Kras, Mst1r overexpression increased acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM), accelerated the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), and resulted in the accumulation of (mannose receptor C type 1) MRC1+, (arginase 1) Arg+ macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Conversely, absence of a functional Mst1r kinase slowed PanIN initiation, resulted in smaller tumors, prolonged survival and a reduced tumor-associated macrophage content. Mst1r expression was associated with increased production of its ligand Mst1, and in orthotopic models, suppression of Mst1 expression resulted in reduced tumor size, changes in macrophage polarization and enhanced T cell infiltration. This study demonstrates the functional significance of Mst1r during pancreatic cancer initiation and progression. Further, it provides proof of concept that targeting Mst1r can modulate pancreatic cancer growth and the microenvironment. This study provides further rationale for targeting Mst1r as a therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2949576961,"Sorghum bicolor is a drought-resilient facultative short-day C4 grass that is grown for grain, forage, and biomass. Adaptation of sorghum for grain production in temperate regions resulted in the selection of mutations in Maturity loci (Ma1 -Ma6) that reduced photoperiod sensitivity and resulted in earlier flowering in long days. Prior studies identified the genes associated with Ma1 (PRR37), Ma3 (PHYB), Ma5 (PHYC) and Ma6 (GHD7) and characterized their role in the flowering time regulatory pathway. The current study focused on understanding the function and identity of Ma2. Ma2 delayed flowering in long days by selectively enhancing the expression of SbPRR37 (Ma1) and SbCO, genes that co-repress the expression of SbCN12, a source of florigen. Genetic analysis identified epistatic interactions between Ma2 and Ma4 and located QTL corresponding to Ma2 on SBI02 and Ma4 on SBI10. Positional cloning and whole genome sequencing identified a candidate gene for Ma2, Sobic.002G302700, which encodes a SET and MYND (SYMD) domain lysine methyltransferase. Eight sorghum genotypes previously identified as recessive for Ma2 contained the mutated version of Sobic.002G302700 present in 80M (ma2) and one additional putative recessive ma2 allele was identified in diverse sorghum accessions."

https://openalex.org/W2938518782,"Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the autonomous nervous system modulation on heart rate and is associated with several pathologies, including cardiac mortality. While mechanistic studies show that smoking is associated with lower HRV, population-based studies present conflicting results.We assessed the mutual effects of active smoking status, cumulative smoking history, and current smoking intensity, on HRV among 4751 adults from the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. The HRV metrics standard deviation of normal-to-normal (NN) inter-beat intervals (SDNN), square root of the mean squared differences of consecutive NN intervals (RMSSD), total power (TP), low (LF) and high frequency (HF) power, and their ratio (LF/HF), were derived from 20-minute electrocardiograms. Smoking status, pack-years (PY), and tobacco grams/day from standardized questionnaires were the main exposures. We fitted linear mixed models to account for relatedness, non-linearity, and moderating effects, and including fractional polynomials.Past smokers had higher HRV levels than never smokers, independently of PY. The association of HRV with current smoking became apparent when accounting for the interaction between smoking status and PY. In current smokers, but not in past smokers, we observed HRV reductions between 2.0% (SDNN) and 4.9% (TP) every 5 PY increase. Furthermore, current smokers were characterized by dose-response reductions of 9.8% (SDNN), 8.9% (RMSSD), 20.1% (TP), 17.7% (LF), and 19.1% (HF), respectively, every 10 grams/day of smoked tobacco, independently of common cardiometabolic conditions and HRV-modifying drugs. The LF/HF ratio was not associated with smoking status, history, or intensity.Smoking cessation was associated with higher HRV levels. In current smokers, heavier smoking intensity appears gradually detrimental on HRV, corroborating previous evidence. By affecting both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system indexes, but not the LF/HF balance, smoking intensity seems to exert a systemic dysautonomic effect."

https://openalex.org/W2938796096,"Introduction Chronic energy deficiency is an important public health problem among older (aged ≥ 65 years) population. Globally, one in seven older people has a medium to high risk of malnutrition. The situation of chronic energy deficiency among older people is quite poorly known in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the magnitude of chronic energy deficiency and associated factors among elders’ aged ≥ 65 years, in Aykel town administration, Amhara Regional State, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross-sectional survey was carried out from March 28th to April 20th, 2018. Study participants were recruited by a census technique. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis used to identify factors associated with chronic energy deficiency. All variables with p–values of < 0.2 in the bivariate analysis were remarked for the multivariable analysis. Both Crude Odds Ratio (COR) and Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) were computed to determine the strength of association. In the multivariate analysis, all variables at p–values of < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Results A total of 892 participants recruited for the study. The prevalence of chronic energy deficiency was 17.6% (95%CI: 15.00, 20.20) among the study community. It was significantly associated with female sex (AOR: 1.58; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.41), age (AOR: 3.90; 95%CI: 1.85, 8.25), household food insecurity (AOR: 1.95; 95%CI: 1.16, 3.00), poor household wealth status (AOR: 1.77; 95%CI: 1.07, 2.94), loss of appetite due to illness (AOR: 2.93, 95%CI: 1.92, 4.48) and poor dietary diversity score (AOR: 5.51; 95%CI: 2.89, 10.52). Conclusions The magnitude of chronic energy deficiency was high in the study area. It was significantly associated with female sex, age, poor dietary diversity score, loss of appetite due to illness, household food insecurity and poor wealth status. Therefore, there is a need to design and implement programs and strategies to improve nutritional status particularly focusing on female older population in improving dietary practices and food security. In addition, improving household economic and living standards is an essential measure to address the burden of CED among the older community."
https://openalex.org/W2951931495,"Background and aim Infection at birth due to mother-to-child (MTC) transmission is the most common cause of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Vietnam. This study was undertaken to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pregnant women and mothers in Vietnam concerning HBV prevention and immunization. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Quang Ninh and Hoa Binh provinces in 2017. A standardized questionnaire was administered to women when they received care at primary and tertiary maternal health clinics. Multivariate regression was used to identify predictors of HBV knowledge and practices. Results Among the 380 women surveyed, 50.3% were pregnant and 49.7% were postpartum. Despite 70.3% of participants reported having received information about HBV during their pregnancy, only 10.8% provided correct answers to all questions regarding HBV transmission routes and preventive measures. Around half of the participants incorrectly believed that HBV is transmitted through sneezing, contaminated water or sharing foods with chronic HBV patients. Although 86.1% of participants believed that HBV vaccination is necessary for infants, only 66.1% responded they were definitely willing to have their own child vaccinated within 24 hours. More than a third of participants expressed concern about having casual contacts or sharing foods with chronic HBV patients. In multivariate analysis, having received information about HBV during their pregnancy was significantly associated with better HBV knowledge score. Delivery at provincial level clinics was a strong predictor for perinatal HBV screening and hepatitis B birth dose administration. Conclusions The results highlight the need to prioritize educating pregnant women and mothers in future public health campaigns in order to increase knowledge, reduce misperception, and improve hepatitis B vaccine birth dose coverage in Vietnam."
https://openalex.org/W2938204690,"Recently, flipped classrooms (FCs) have gradually been used in Chinese higher education settings. However, few studies have focused on the effects of FCs on interdisciplinary curricula. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of an FC on the engagement, performance, and perceptions of students and on teacher-student interaction in a pharmaceutical marketing course.A clustered randomized controlled study was conducted, with 137 junior-year pharmacy undergraduates using an FC serving as the intervention group, in contrast to students using lecture-based learning (LBL) as the control group. Flanders' interaction analysis system (FIAS) was used to measure teacher-student interaction, and questionnaires regarding attitudes toward and satisfaction with the teaching model were administered.The students in the FC group scored significantly higher than those in the LBL group (88.21±5.95 vs. 80.05±5.59, t = -8.08, p = 0.000) on pharmaceutical marketing. The multiple linear regression results showed that the FC model had a significant impact on student performance (β = 8.16, p<0.0001). The percentages of teacher talk in the FC and LBL groups were 21% and 96%, respectively (χ2 = 2170.274, p = 0.000); however, the percentages of student talk in the FC and LBL groups were 75% and 2.6%, respectively (χ2 = 2012.483, p = 0.000). Compared with the LBL group, most students in the FC group held more positive attitudes toward the teaching model; the mean scores for the 8 attitude attributes in the FC group were significantly higher than those in the LBL group (p = 0.000). There were significant differences in the ratings of satisfaction with teacher-student interaction (p = 0.000), the students' learning attitude (p = 0.000), the teacher's preparatory work (p = 0.000), the teaching objective (p = 0.000), and the teaching effect (p = 0.000) between the two groups.Compared with LBL methods, implementing the FC model improved student performance, increased teacher-student interaction and generated positive student attitudes toward the experience. As an effective pedagogical model, it can also stimulate pharmacy students' learning interest and improve their self-learning abilities."

https://openalex.org/W2935759262,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive tumor of the brain. NF1, a tumor suppressor gene and RAS-GTPase, is one of the highly mutated genes in GBM. Dysregulated NF1 expression promotes cell invasion, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. Loss of NF1 expression in glioblastoma is associated with increased aggressiveness of the tumor. Here, we show that NF1-loss in patient-derived glioma cells using shRNA increases self-renewal, heightens cell invasion, and promotes mesenchymal subtype and epithelial mesenchymal transition-specific gene expression that enhances tumorigenesis. The neurofibromin protein contains at least four major domains, with the GAP-related domain being the most well-studied. In this study, we report that the leucine-rich domain (LRD) of neurofibromin inhibits invasion of human glioblastoma cells without affecting their proliferation. Moreover, under conditions tested, the NF1-LRD fails to hydrolyze Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP, suggesting that its suppressive function is independent of Ras signaling. We further demonstrate that rare variants within the NF1-LRD domain found in a subset of the patients are pathogenic and reduce NF1-LRD's invasion suppressive function. Taken together, our results show, for the first time, that NF1-LRD inhibits glioma invasion, and provides evidence of a previously unrecognized function of NF1-LRD in glioma biology."
https://openalex.org/W2938663412,"Biomineralization is a widespread biological process in the formation of shells, teeth, or bones. Matrix proteins in biominerals have been widely investigated for their roles in directing biomineralization processes such as crystal morphologies, polymorphs, and orientations. Here, we characterized a basic matrix protein, named mantle protein N25 (N25), identified previously in the Akoya pearl oyster (Pinctada fucata). Unlike some known acidic matrix proteins containing Asp or Glu as possible Ca2+-binding residues, we found that N25 is rich in Pro (12.4%), Ser (12.8%), and Lys (8.8%), suggesting it may perform a different function. We used the recombinant protein purified by refolding from inclusion bodies in a Ca(HCO3)2 supersaturation system and found that it specifically affects calcite morphologies. An X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) assay revealed that N25 could help delay the transformation of vaterites (a metastable calcium carbonate polymorph) to calcite. We also used fluorescence super-resolution imaging to map the distribution of N25 in CaCO3 crystals and transfected a recombinant N25-EGFP vector into HEK-293T cells to mimic the native process in which N25 is secreted by mantle epithelial cells and integrated into mineral structures. Our observations suggest N25 specifically affects crystal morphologies and provide evidence that basic proteins lacking acidic groups can also direct biomineralization. We propose that the attachment of N25 to specific sites on CaCO3 crystals may inhibit some crystal polymorphs or morphological transformation. Biomineralization is a widespread biological process in the formation of shells, teeth, or bones. Matrix proteins in biominerals have been widely investigated for their roles in directing biomineralization processes such as crystal morphologies, polymorphs, and orientations.

Biomineralization is a crucial and widespread process among various species from prokaryotic magnetic bacteria to advanced eukaryotic organisms. Typical structures like magnetosome, spicule, shell, teeth, and bone are the products of these processes. These biominerals, which mainly consist of inorganic materials, offer organisms the functions of hunting, navigating, and defending (1Baeuerlein E.

Calcium carbonate is one of the most abundant biomineralization materials utilized by numerous creatures because Ca2+ and CO32− are common metabolic substances both inside and outside cells and CaCO3 crystals possess excellent mechanical properties and plasticity (3Currey J.D.

One of the areas of most concern in biomineralization is the molecular mechanism that regulates the ordered deposition of inorganic ions into solid phases. It has been shown that organic macromolecules, mainly containing proteins, chitin, and other components, may play substantial roles during these processes, although the content of macromolecules is less than 5% of the dry weights of the biominerals (6Heuer A.H.

In common with other biominerals, shell formation is considered to be under the control of organic materials.

Proteins Pif97 and Pif80 are believed to regulate the lamellar sheets of the nacreous layer, and during this process, Pif97 functions as a chitin-binding protein and probably recruits Pif80, possibly together with N16, to induce the deposition of aragonite on chitin membrane in specific c-axis orientation (12Metzler R.A.

These candidate genes were up-regulated at least 20 times at the juvenile stage and were thought to be closely related to biomineralization because the typical shell structures begin to form during this period. One of the candidates, the protein PfY2, was identified as a novel matrix protein and has been reported as an inhibitory regulator of CaCO3 precipitation (26Yan Y. Yang D. Yang X. Liu C. Xie J. Zheng G. Xie L. Zhang R. A novel matrix protein, PfY2, functions as a crucial macromolecule during shell formation.Sci.

A deeper investigation was conducted in this study, and a new matrix protein-coding gene, N25, was cloned, and this protein was further identified as a matrix protein exhibiting calcite binding and morphological modifying abilities. After cloning the full-length cDNA of N25, it was necessary to determine the sites where N25 was synthesized and expressed and where N25 protein localized. The real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay was conducted in different tissues, including foot, viscus, gonad, mantle edge, mantle pallium, gill, and adductor muscle, to reveal the tissue-specific expression pattern. The result showed that the N25 mRNA was narrowly synthesized in the mantle tissue, which is thought to be the most substantial organ directing shell formation, with a much higher amount than in other tissues (Fig. 1D). Correspondingly, N25 protein was also detected in both the extracts from the decalcified prismatic insoluble matrix (PISM) and nacreous insoluble matrix (NISM), but the signal from PISM was stronger than that of NISM (Fig. 1C). These results implied that N25 was mainly expressed in mantle tissue and finally integrated into shell structure as a part of the insoluble frame. It is believed that the mantle tissue mainly controls shell formation, during which cells facing the inner side of the shell are responsible for the secretion of matrix proteins and other components. However, it is not possible to observe the process of how N25 is synthesized and secreted by the mantle epithelial cells due to a lack of both an appropriate bivalve cell line and an efficient gene transduction system. As a compromise, the eukaryotic 293T cell was chosen as a substitute. N25-EGFP with secretion signal peptide (Fig. S1) was expressed initially and distributed uniformly in the cytoplasm, and the subsequent appearance of tiny fluorescence spots represented the local regions with highly condensed recombinant protein. We speculated that these spots were vesicles. In addition, we found that the average fluorescence intensity of N25-EGFP decreased after imaging the cells with a time-lapse method. The absolute intensity of the region of interest o (ROIo) declined significantly from 0 to 42 min (Fig. 2E), and correspondingly, the amounts of spots in ROIo deceased compared with 0 min (Fig. 2, A and B). The region of interest c (ROIc) was chosen as a control to eliminate or minimize the possibility that the decreased fluorescence intensity was induced by nonspecific photobleaching. The relative intensity of ROIo, which also dropped at 42 min (Fig. 2F), is represented by the intensity ratio of ROIo to ROIc to subtract the influence of the decline of the base intensity. The motion image is available in Movie S1. To further investigate the exact secretion process of a single vesicle, we performed TIRF imaging of the cells, and only those vesicles located near or even anchored to the bottom membrane were observed. Fig. 2, G–J, shows the secretion process, during which a spot disappeared by rapid diffusion between 130 and 130.3 s, as indicated with the white arrows. The dynamic image is available in Movie S2. It could be concluded from these observations that the predicted signal peptide of N25 worked in the eukaryotic cell and the synthetic proteins were involved in a secretion pathway that could mimic similar events in mantle cells. Several methods have been applied to explore the expression output of protein in Escherichia col; however, it was fairly difficult to obtain condensed and relatively pure N25 protein because most of the protein exists in inclusion bodies except for a tiny amount in soluble form. The inclusion bodies were washed with 1% Triton X-100 and dissolved in denaturant followed by purification with affinitive chromatography. Denatured N25 was further linearized by reducing disulfide bonds with DTT and dropped into a refolding environment with no denaturant, leading to an instant dilution of N25 into a low enough concentration that prevented the unfolded N25 from aggregating; then the protein molecule would refold spontaneously to a stable native packed conformation. After affinitive chromatography with Ni-NTA, the relatively pure N25 was harvested and condensed by ultrafiltration before analyzing by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The apparent molecular mass of N25 was about 35 kDa, consistent with the bands in Fig. 1C but nevertheless different from the calculated value of 25 kDa. To further identify the purified protein, the band in SDS-PAGE was analyzed and confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. S5). Post-translational modification analysis (Table S1) and practical molecular mass measurement (Fig. S6) were also conducted by LC-mass spectrometry (MS) and QTOF-MS, respectively. The measured molecular mass of N25 was 25,776 Da, which was 124 Da larger than the predicted value of 25,652 Da, which suggests that the structure or shape of the molecule probably contributed to the altered migration. CaCO3 and chitin binding assays were performed to explore the affinity properties and interaction between N25 and different crystal polymorphs because the attachment of proteins might play critical roles in regulating crystal characteristics. N25 protein was mixed with calcite, aragonite, and chitin, respectively, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. 1% Triton X-100 was applied to wash away the nonspecifically absorbent proteins before analyzing the samples by SDS-PAGE. Components remaining after washing were thought to have a relatively strong interaction with the solid materials. As shown in Fig. 1B, N25 protein was able to bind all three materials; however, calcite binding was a bit stronger than that of aragonite, but both calcite binding and aragonite binding were obviously higher than that of chitin. In contrast, maltose-binding protein (MBP), used as a negative control, showed no affinity for any of the materials. These data demonstrated that N25 attached specifically to calcite, aragonite, and chitin, implying its natural integration into the shell components. The influence of N25 on the transformation of ACC to a stable crystalline structure was estimated by the ACC transition assay. ACC formed immediately at the moment Ca2+ was mixed with CO32− and transformed to calcite rapidly in less than 15 min (Fig. 3, buffer group). The compositions of buffer groups all changed into calcites at 15, 35, and 55 min (Fig. 3). MBPs present in the reaction solution slightly delayed the transition to calcites from vaterites (Fig. 3, MBP group), a kind of crystal form that was considered as a metastable polymorph of CaCO3 and would finally change to calcites after a long enough the time. At 15 min, 29.9% of vaterites remained in the MBP group, and the proportion declined to 22.7% at 35 min and finally to 16.7% at 55 min. In contrast, vaterites in N25 groups were maintained for a longer period with percentages of 51.3% at 15 min and 51.8% at 55 min, whereas at 35 min the proportion was 39.8%, which was relatively lower compared with the other time points but still significantly higher than those of the MBP groups. These observations and results indicated that N25 protein might help to stabilize the vaterites and delay their transformation into calcites. The effects of N25 on the morphology and polymorphism of CaCO3 crystals were explored by its addition to a reaction system containing saturated Ca(HCO3)2 solution, constituted by mixing Ca2+ and HCO3− solution to an ultimate Ca2+ concentration of about 8 mm. Compared with the typical rhombohedral calcite crystals in the control group supplied with storage buffer (Fig. 4, A and A1), the crystals in the MBP group that contained 200 μg/ml MBP showed no obvious morphology alteration (Fig. 4, B and B1), whereas the crystals in the N25 group showed significant changes in crystal morphologies (Fig. 4, C and C1). The degree of morphology alteration increased with elevated concentrations of N25 from 4 μg/ml to 40 and 200 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 4, D–F). We noticed that the rhombohedral faces began to shrink at the edges and corners, whereas some extra growth structures also arose randomly and irregularly on the faces of crystal particles. Fig. 4G shows, at the 4th day, an extreme state of the abnormal morphology that might be caused by a complicated cooperative effect contributed by extra overgrowth on each face together with the inhibition of the corners and edges. Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the crystal forms of these particles and indicated that most of the particles in each group were calcites with specific peaks around 283, 713 and 1088 cm−1 except the spherical particles indicated with black arrows in Fig. 4, C and G, whose characteristic peaks were 301, 620, 1075, and 1091 cm−1, illustrating their vaterite property (Fig. 4H). These data showed that N25 may play critical roles in regulating calcite morphology. For a deeper understanding of how N25 affected calcite crystallization, distribution mapping assays were conducted by labeling N25 with the fluorescent dye Cy5-NHS ester before adding to the calcite crystallization reaction. The super-resolution images were harvested with z-axis stacks at a z resolution of 0.1 μm and reconstructed to a 3D image by a Nikon (Japan) structured illumination microscope (N-SIM) at an excitation wavelength of 645 nm. It was observed that the fluorescence signal showed inhomogenous distribution from the front view (Fig. 5A1) and the side view (Fig. 5A2); moreover, N25 protein seemed to encircle the crystal and reside on the surfaces. To further confirm this observation, the fluorescence intensity was analyzed for each section slice, and the 2D histograms are presented for slices 23, 53, and 83, respectively (Fig. 5, B1–B3 and C1–C3), in which most of the signal pixels are distributed in a circular pattern without fluorescent signals inside the crystals. A surface simulation was performed to further clarify the N25 distribution pattern by replacing the red fluorescent signals with white granules. These white granules were shown to attach to the main faces and the shrunken borders of calcite crystal habit (Fig. 5D2), which could be correlated to the contractive edges in Fig. 5E2. A smaller signal ring, indicated by the white arrowhead in Fig. 5D1, arose inside the large fluorescent circle near the bottom of the glass plate and corresponded to the irregularly sinking cavities presented and indicated in Fig. 5E1 with a white arrowhead. We then mimicked the theoretic morphology and crystal habit in the normal condition and a specific situation with modified morphological parameters. The growth equilibrium theory was proposed to predict the normal morphology according to the structure of calcite, and a hexahedron-shaped crystal habit was generated (Fig. 5F1), which was consistent with the typical crystal habit of calcite in ambient condition. Several growth faces were listed with different growth rates; however, the {1 0 4}, {0 1 8}, {1 1 0}, {0 1 2}, and {0 0 6} were the five most possible growth faces with relatively low growth rates. The final habit of calcite showed only one face, {1 0 4}, because this face showed the lowest growth rate and constituted the main crystal habit. In a modified condition (Table 1), the distances of the other faces were decreased to 5920.8, 6720.8, 7740.6, and 6640.6, respectively, which induced these faces to emerge (Fig. 5F2). When further decreasing the distances to 4920.8, 5720.8, 6030.6, and 5040.6, respectively, the area of these faces expanded, whereas the {1 0 4} face area declined correspondingly (Fig. 5F3). Parameters that were utilized for calculation are listed in Table 1. We could infer from these observations that N25 bound to specific crystal surfaces of calcites first and then modified the morphology, potentially through increasing the attachment energy and decelerating the growth of these crystal faces.Table 1Initial and modified parameters calculated for calcite morphologyhklMultiplicityE-attDistanceModified E-att AModified distance AModified E-att BModified distance B{1 0 4}6−4960.44960.4−4960.44960.4−4960.44960.4{0 1 8}6−9920.89920.8−5920.85920.8−4920.84920.8{1 1 0}6−9920.89920.8−6720.86720.8−5720.85720.8{0 1 2}6−8940.68940.6−7740.67740.6−6030.66030.6{0"
https://openalex.org/W2937591818,"Improvement in Home Dialysis (HoD) utilizations as a mean to improve the patient reported and health services outcomes, has been a long-held goal of the providers and healthcare system in United States. However, measures to improve HoD rates have yielded limited success so far. Lack of patient awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its management options, is one of the important barriers against patient adoption of HoD. Despite ample evidence that Comprehensive pre-ESERD Patient Education (CPE) improves patient awareness and informed HoD choice, use of CPE among US advanced CKD patients is low. Need for significant resources, lack of validated data showing unequivocal and reproducible benefits, and the lack of validated CPE protocols proven to have consistent efficacy in improving not only patient awareness but also HoD rates in US population, are major limitations deterring adoption of CPE in routine clinical practice. We recently demonstrated that if a structured, protocol based CPE is integrated within the routine nephrology care for patients with advanced CKD, it substantially improves informed HoD choice and utilizations. However, this requires establishing CPE resources within each nephrology practice. Efficacy of a stand-alone CPE model, independent of clinical care, has not been examined till date. In this report we report the efficacy of our structured CPE protocol, delivered outside the realm of routine nephrology care—as a stand-alone patient education program, in a geographically distant region, and show that: when provided opportunity for informed dialysis choice, a majority of advanced CKD patients in US would prefer HoD. We also show that initiating CPE leads to accelerated growth in HoD utilizations and reduces disparities in HoD utilizations, goals for system improvements. Finally, the reproducibility of our structured CPE protocol with consistent efficacy data suggest that initiating such programs at institutional levels has the potential to improve informed dialysis selection and HoD rates across any similar large healthcare institute within US."

The transmembrane proteoglycan syndecan-4 localizes to these attachment points and has been shown to be important in the initial stages of cardiac remodeling, but its mechanistic function in the heart remains insufficiently understood. Here, we sought to map the cardiac interactome of syndecan-4 to better understand its function and downstream signaling mechanisms. By combining two different affinity purification methods with MS analysis, we found that the cardiac syndecan-4 interactome consists of 21 novel and 29 previously described interaction partners. Nine of the novel partners were further validated to bind syndecan-4 in HEK293 cells (i.e. CAVIN1/PTRF, CCT5, CDK9, EIF2S1, EIF4B, MPP7, PARVB, PFKM, and RASIP). We also found that 19 of the 50 interactome partners bind differently to syndecan-4 in the left ventricle lysate from aortic-banded heart failure (ABHF) rats compared with SHAM-operated animals. One of these partners was the well-known mechanotransducer muscle LIM protein (MLP), which showed direct and increased binding to syndecan-4 in ABHF. Nuclear translocation is important in MLP-mediated signaling, and we found less MLP in the nuclear-enriched fractions from syndecan-4−/− mouse left ventricles but increased nuclear MLP when syndecan-4 was overexpressed in a cardiomyocyte cell line. In the presence of a cell-permeable syndecan-4–MLP disruptor peptide, the nuclear MLP level was reduced. These findings suggest that syndecan-4 mediates nuclear translocation of MLP in the heart.

https://openalex.org/W2935995840,"Despite the removal of user fees on public primary healthcare in Zambia, prior studies suggest that out-of-pocket payments are still significant. However, we have little understanding of the extent to which out-of-pocket payments lead patients to hardship methods of financing out-of-pocket costs. This study analyses the prevalence and determinants of hardship financing arising from out-of-pocket payments in healthcare, using data from a nationally-representative household health expenditure survey conducted in 2014. We employ a sequential logistic regression model to examine the factors associated with the risk of hardship financing conditional on reporting an illness and an out-of-pocket expenditure. The results show that up to 11% of households who reported an illness had borrowed money, or sold items or asked a friend for help, or displaced other household consumption in order to pay for health care. The risk of hardship financing was higher among the poorest households, female headed-households and households who reside further from health facilities. Improvements in physical access and quality of public health services have the potential to reduce the incidence of hardship financing especially among the poorest."

https://openalex.org/W2940265636,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) affects about 700.000 individuals per year worldwide with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as a major subcategory. Despite a comprehensive treatment concept including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy the 5-year survival rate is still only about 50 percent. Chronic inflammation is one of the hallmarks of carcinogenesis. Until now, little is known about the premalignant status of oral lichen planus (OLP) and molecular alterations in OLP are still poorly characterized. Our study aims to delineate differential DNA methylation patterns in OLP, OSCC, and normal oral mucosa. By applying a bead chip approach, we identified altered chromosomal patterns characteristic for OSCC while finding no recurrent alterations in OLP. In contrast, we identified numerous alterations in the DNA methylation pattern in OLP, as compared to normal controls, that were also present in OSCC. Our data support the hypothesis that OLP is a precursor lesion of OSCC sharing multiple epigenetic alterations with OSCC."

A movie with large field of view (∼10mm2) records thousands of cells (e.g. ≈ 5000 cells even at a low cell density of 20 × 106 cells/ml) at once and yields averaged measurements of the mean () and standard deviation (σ) of the swimming speed, head oscillation amplitude (A0) and frequency (f0), and the fraction of motile spermatozoa (α). Interestingly, we found that the measurement of α is facilitated because the swimming spermatozoa enhance the motion of the non-swimming population. We demonstrate the ease and rapidity of our method by performing on-farm characterisation of bull spermatozoa motility, and validate the technique by comparing laboratory measurements with tracking. Our results confirm the long-standing theoretical prediction that for swimming spermatozoa."

They have been demonstrated to be more informative than conventional barcoding methods. Hence in this study, foliar endophytic fungal (FEF) assemblages in three Magnoliopsida plants were delimited using nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence-secondary structural features based phylogenetic analysis, also known as molecular morphometrics. A total of 392 FEF isolates were obtained from the Aglaia elaeagnoidea, Flacourtia inermis, and Premna serratifolia leaves and grouped into 98 morphotypes. Among these host plants, P. serratifolia showed the maximum percentage of colonization frequency. Representatives of each morphotype was sequenced and subjected to further molecular characterization. The results revealed that morphotypes were belonged to the phylum of Ascomycota, distributed over two classes (Sordariomycetes (68.59%) and Dothideomycetes (31.41%)), 6 orders and 19 genera. Based on compensatory base changes (CBC) analysis and absolute identity of ITS2 structure, 21, 20 and 23 species were recognized from A. elaeagnoidea, F. inermis, and P. serratifolia respectively. Diversity indices were higher in A. elaeagnoidea, despite it accounted for a modest 16.8% of total isolates recorded in this study. The genus Colletotrichum was predominant in A. elaeagnoidea (39%) and P. serratifolia (48%). Similarly, Diaporthe (43%) was dominant in F. inermis. Several host-specific species were also observed. This study concludes that these plants host diverse species of Ascomycota. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed report on FEF diversity from these plants. Also, the inclusion of ITS2 secondary structure information along with the sequence provides a further dimension to resolve the inherent problems in identification of fungal species."

However, how this signaling pathway induces cell death is unclear. Previously, we found that the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 pathway activates the pro-apoptotic transcriptional co-regulator Cited2 in vitro after DNA damage. In the present study, we report that Cited2 protein expression is also dramatically increased following stroke/ischemic insult. Critically, utilizing conditional knockout mice, we show that Cited2 is required for neuronal cell death, both in culture and in mice after ischemic insult. Importantly, determining the mechanism by which Cited2 levels are regulated, we found that E2F transcription factor (E2F) family members participate in Cited2 regulation. First, E2F1 expression induced Cited2 transcription, and E2F1 deficiency reduced Cited2 expression. Moreover, determining the potential E2F-binding regions on the Cited2 gene regulatory sequence by ChIP analysis, we provide evidence that E2F1/4 proteins bind to this DNA region. A luciferase reporter assay to probe the functional outcomes of this interaction revealed that E2F1 activates and E2F4 inhibits Cited2 transcription. Moreover, we identified the functional binding motif for E2F1 in the Cited2 gene promoter by demonstrating that mutation of this site dramatically reduces E2F1-mediated Cited2 transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2938183404,"The radiological consequences of a nuclear power plant (NPP) accident, resulting in the release of radionuclides to the environment, will depend largely on the mitigating actions instigated shortly after the accident. It is therefore important to make predictions of the radiation dose to the affected population, from external as well as internal exposure, soon after an accident, despite the fact that data are scarce. The aim of this study was to develop a model for the prediction of the cumulative effective dose up to 84 years of age based on the ground deposition of 137Cs that is determined soon after fallout. The model accounts for different assumptions regarding external and internal dose contributions, and the model parameters in this study were chosen to reflect various mitigating actions. Furthermore, the relative importance of these parameters was determined by sensitivity analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this model is unique as it allows quantification of both the external and the internal effective dose using only a fallout map of 137Cs after a nuclear power plant accident. The cumulative effective dose over a period of 50 years following the accident per unit 137Cs deposited was found to range from 0.14 mSv/kBq m-2 to 1.5 mSv/kBq m-2, depending on the mitigating actions undertaken. According to the sensitivity analysis, the most important parameters governing the cumulative effective dose to various adult populations during 50 years after the fallout appear to be: the correlation factor between the local areal deposition of 137Cs and the maximum initial ambient dose rate; the maximum transfer from regional average fallout on the ground to body burden; the local areal deposition of 137Cs; and the regional average 137Cs deposition. Therefore, it is important that mapping of local 137Cs deposition is carried out immediately after fallout from a nuclear power plant accident, followed by calculations of radiation doses for different scenarios using well-known parameters, in order to identify the most efficient mitigation strategies. Given this 137Cs mapping, we believe our model is a valuable tool for long-term radiological assessment in the early phase after NPP accidents."

Here we report the analysis of a ΔabsA2 deletion strain, which exhibits the classic precocious antibiotic hyper-production phenotype, and its complementation by an N-terminal triple-FLAG-tagged version of AbsA2. The complemented and non-complemented ΔabsA2 mutant strains were used in large-scale microarray-based time-course experiments to investigate the effect of deleting absA2 on gene expression and to identify the in vivo AbsA2 DNA-binding target sites using ChIP-on chip. We show that in addition to binding to the promoter regions of redZ and actII-orfIV AbsA2 binds to several previously unidentified sites within the cda biosynthetic gene cluster within and/or upstream of SCO3215—SCO3216, SCO3217, SCO3229—SCO3230, and SCO3226, and we relate the pattern of AbsA2 binding to the results of the transcriptomic study and antibiotic phenotypic assays. Interestingly, dual ‘biphasic’ ChIP peaks were observed with AbsA2 binding across the regulatory genes actII-orfIV and redZ and the absA2 gene itself, while more conventional single promoter-proximal peaks were seen at the CDA biosynthetic genes suggesting a different mechanism of regulation of the former loci. Taken together the results shed light on the complex mechanism of regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor and the important role of AbsA2 in controlling the expression of three antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters."

https://openalex.org/W2938132364,"The voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channel Kv1.3 regulates leukocyte proliferation, activation, and apoptosis, and altered expression of this channel is linked to autoimmune diseases. Thus, the fine-tuning of Kv1.3 function is crucial for the immune system response. The Kv1.3 accessory protein, potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E (KCNE) subunit 4, acts as a dominant negative regulatory subunit to both enhance inactivation and induce intracellular retention of Kv1.3. Mutations in KCNE4 also cause immune system dysfunction. Although the formation of Kv1.3-KCNE4 complexes has profound consequences for leukocyte physiology, the molecular determinants involved in the Kv1.3-KCNE4 association are unknown. We now show that KCNE4 associates with Kv1.3 via a tetraleucine motif situated within the carboxy-terminal domain of this accessory protein. This motif would function as an interaction platform, in which Kv1.3 and Ca2+/calmodulin compete for the KCNE4 interaction. Finally, we propose a structural model of the Kv1.3-KCNE4 complex. Our experimental data and the in silico structure suggest that the KCNE4 interaction hides a forward-trafficking motif within Kv1.3 in addition to adding a strong endoplasmic reticulum retention signature to the Kv1.3-KCNE4 complex. Thus, the oligomeric composition of the Kv1.3 channelosome fine-tunes the precise balance between anterograde and intracellular retention elements that control the cell surface expression of Kv1.3 and immune system physiology.-Solé, L., Roig, S.

L. acutangula is widely grown; however, L. aegyptiaca is considered as an underutilized crop. The species delimits, phylogenetic positions, and the varietal identities of L. acutangula and L. aegyptiaca in Sri Lanka are not known. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to establish the species delimits and varietal identities of L. acutangula and L. aegyptiaca varieties grown in Sri Lanka using morphometric, phylogenetic and organoleptic assessments. We assessed five varieties of L. acutangula and three varieties of L. aegyptiaca. The vegetative and reproductive data were collected for the morphometric analysis and DNA sequence polymorphism of the makers rbcL, trnH-psbA and ITS for the phylogenetic analysis. We also conducted an organoleptic assessment based on taste parameters; aroma, bitterness, color, texture, and overall preference using the dishes prepared according to the most common Sri Lankan recipe for Luffa. The variation of the vegetative and reproductive traits grouped L. acutangula varieties into two distinct clusters. The trnH-psbA polymorphism provided the basis for the species delimits of L. acutangula and L. aegyptiaca. The rbcL and ITS polymorphisms provided the basis for the identities of the varieties of L. aegyptiaca and L. acutangula respectively. In the phylogeny, the L. acutangula varieties of Sri Lanka formed a unique clade and the L. aegyptiaca varieties formed a reciprocal monophyletic group in comparison to worldwide L. aegyptiaca reported. The taste parameters aroma, texture, color, and overall preference were significantly different among the Luffa varieties. The L. aegyptiaca varieties received lower preference in the organoleptic assessment. The present study sets the species delimits, phylogenetic positions and the varietal identities of the cultivated germplasm of Luffa and revealed the distinct morphological and organoleptic properties of each variety."

Among them, the presence of a unique mitochondrion is remarkable. Even though the mitochondrial DNA constitutes up to 25% of total cellular DNA, the structure and functionality of the mitochondrion are dependent on the expression of the nuclear genome. As in other eukaryotes, specific peptide signals have been proposed to drive the mitochondrial localization of a subset of trypanosomatid proteins. However, there are mitochondrial proteins encoded in the nuclear genome that lack of a peptide signal. In other eukaryotes, alternative protein targeting to subcellular organelles via mRNA localization has also been recognized and specific mRNA localization towards the mitochondria has been described. With the aim of seeking for mitochondrial localization signals in T. cruzi, we developed a strategy to build a comprehensive database of nuclear genes encoding predicted mitochondrial proteins (MiNT) in the TriTryps (T. cruzi, T. brucei and L. major). We found that approximately 15% of their nuclear genome encodes mitochondrial products. In T. cruzi the MiNT database reaches 1438 genes and a conserved peptide signal, M(L/F) R (R/S) SS, named TryM-TaPe is found in 60% of these genes, suggesting that the canonical mRNA guidance mechanism is present. In addition, the search for compositional signals in the transcripts of T. cruzi MiNT genes produce a list, being worth to note a conserved non-translated element represented by the consensus sequence DARRVSG. Taking into account its reported interaction with the T. brucei TRRM3 protein which is enriched in the mitochondrial membrane fraction, we here suggest a putative zip code role for this element. Globally, here we provide an inventory of the mitochondrial proteins in T. cruzi and give evidence for the existence of both peptide and mRNA signals specific to nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2937281245,"A major challenge in HIV vaccine development is the identification of immunogens able to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). While remarkable progress has been made in the isolation and characterization of bNAbs, the epitopes they recognize appear to be poorly immunogenic. Thus, none of the candidate vaccines developed to date has induced satisfactory levels of neutralizing antibodies to the HIV envelope protein (Env). One approach to the problem of poor immunogenicity is to build vaccines based on envelope (env) genes retrieved from rare individuals termed elite neutralizers (ENs) who at one time possessed specific sequences that stimulated the formation of bNAbs. Env proteins selected from these individuals could possess uncommon, yet to be defined, structural features that enhance the immunogenicity of epitopes recognized by bNAbs. Here we describe the recovery of envs from an EN that developed unusually broad and potent bNAbs. As longitudinal specimens were not available, we combined plasma and provirus sequences acquired from a single time-point to infer a phylogenetic tree. Combining ancestral reconstruction data with virus neutralization data allowed us to sift through the myriad of virus quasi-species that evolved in this individual to identify envelope sequences from the nodes that appeared to define the transition from neutralization sensitive envs to the neutralization resistant envs that occur in EN plasma. Synthetic genes from these nodes were functional in infectivity assays and sensitive to neutralization by bNAbs, and may provide a novel source of immunogens for HIV vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2936134993,"Introduction Previous research has indicated that only children (i.e., those living with no siblings) have higher odds of obesity during childhood and young adulthood, compared with those living with siblings. However, little is known about whether the developing difference in overweight/obesity is accompanied by a difference in mental health (i.e., internalizing symptoms of depression and anxiety). Methods The subjects for this prospective study were a randomly generated cohort of 1348 high-school students in Guangzhou, China. Participants completed assessments of anthropometric indices, lipid profiles, family-based factors, lifestyle, and internalization of symptoms (including those of depression and anxiety). Results Compared to their peers with siblings, only children (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.06, 2.65]) had significantly higher risk for obesity. However, only children with overweight/obesity had lower OR for depression at follow-up (aOR = 0.19, 95% CI [0.34, 0.86]), compared to individuals who were overweight/obese with siblings. This relationship was not significant for non-overweight individuals. No significant relationship between the number of siblings and anxiety at follow-up was observed, regardless of body mass index (BMI). Conclusions Although being an only child was significantly associated with overweight and obesity among adolescents in China, participants with history of overweight/obesity are less likely to experience symptoms of depression associated with being an only child."
https://openalex.org/W2936703579,"Background Brachial artery reactivity (BAR) is usually determined as the maximum brachial artery diameter (BAD) following release of an occluding pressure cuff compared to a BAD before cuff inflation. BAD early after cuff deflation can also serve as baseline for estimating total brachial artery reactivity (TBAR). We investigate whether TBAR is associated with first time coronary heart disease events. Methods Participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (n = 5499) consisting of whites, African-Americans, Chinese and Hispanics were followed longitudinally for a mean of 12.5 years. Brachial artery ultrasound was performed following five minutes of cuff occlusion at the forearm. TBAR was estimated from BAD following cuff release as the difference between maximum and minimum brachial artery diameters divided by the minimum diameter multiplied by 100%. TBAR was added to multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with Framingham risk factors as predictors and time to first coronary heart disease event as outcome. Results Average TBAR was 9.7% (9.7 SD). Mean age was 61.7 years, 50.9% women. Increased TBAR was associated with lower risk of CHD events with a hazard rate of 0.78 per SD increase (95% C.I. 0.67, 0.91; p = 0.001). A TBAR below the median of 7.87% (Inter Quartile Range: 4.16%, 13.0%) was associated with a 31% lower risk of coronary heart disease event (Hazard Ratio: 0.69; 95% C.I.: 0.55, 0.87). Conclusion TBAR is an independent predictor of first time coronary heart disease events and is exclusively measured after release of a blood pressure occlusion cuff."

Detailed information usually obtained by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) on the contribution of blood supply from internal and external carotid artery branches is required to prevent non-target embolization and is helpful for pre-surgical planning. Purpose To investigate the contribution of the feeding vasculature to intracranial meningiomas with superselective arterial spin labelling (sASL) as an alternative to DSA. Material and methods Consecutive patients presenting for meningioma resection were prospectively included. sASL perfusion images acquired on a clinical 3T MRI scanner were independently rated by two readers. Contribution of the external carotid artery (ECA), internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral/basilar artery (VA/BA) was rated as none, <50% or >50%. Correlation of sASL was performed in two patients undergoing DSA. Results 32 patients (61 ± 13 years) harboring 42 meningiomas could be included. sASL was technically successful in all patients. 19 meningiomas had ICA dominant supply, 19 had ECA dominant supply. One meningioma had mixed supply and in three meningiomas a perfusion signal could not be detected. While exclusive unilateral ECA supply was common (n = 14) and exclusive unilateral ICA was rare (n = 4), mixed supply from multiple vessels (n = 20) was a frequent finding. Interrater agreement was substantial (κ = 0.73). Agreement with DSA was perfect within our predefined categories. Conclusion sASL is able to identify the presence and extent of the feeding vasculature in intracranial meningiomas."
https://openalex.org/W2939085134,"Locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a state of quadriplegia and anarthria with preserved consciousness, which is generally triggered by a disruption of specific white matter fiber tracts, following a lesion in the ventral part of the pons. However, the impact of focal lesions on the whole brain white matter microstructure and structural connectivity pathways remains unknown. We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) and tract-based statistics to characterise the whole white matter tracts in seven consecutive LIS patients, with ventral pontine injuries but no significant supratentorial lesions detected with morphological MRI. The imaging was performed in the acute phase of the disease (26 ± 13 days after the accident). DT-MRI-derived metrics were used to quantitatively assess global white matter alterations. All diffusion coefficient Z-scores were decreased for almost all fiber tracts in all LIS patients, with diffuse white matter alterations in both infratentorial and supratentorial areas. A mixture model of two multidimensional Gaussian distributions was fitted to cluster the white matter fiber tracts studied in two groups: the least (group 1) and most injured white matter fiber tracts (group 2). The greatest injuries were revealed along pathways crossing the lesion responsible for the LIS: left and right medial lemniscus (98.4% and 97.9% probability of belonging to group 2, respectively), left and right superior cerebellar peduncles (69.3% and 45.7% probability) and left and right corticospinal tract (20.6% and 46.5% probability). This approach demonstrated globally compromised white matter tracts in the acute phase of LIS, potentially underlying cognitive deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2935698665,"The fibularis tertius muscle (FTM) is a rare anatomic variation. The prevalence of this exclusively human structure, which is found in the anterior compartment of the leg, is often underestimated, and it is believed that foot and ankle conditions are more difficult to manage in patients with an FTM. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of the FTM palpation and determine whether its presence is associated with an individual’s sex, because the exact prevalence in males and females is unclear. An observational cross-sectional study was carried out. The study included 481 people (23.49% men and 76.51% women) with a mean age of 23.51±5.369 years, who were recruited from a Podiatric Medicine and Surgery Clinic (Spain). Data on routine demographic and clinical factors were recorded, and the presence or absence of the FTM was determined based on surface visual or palpated localization of the tendon (using a consistent protocol). The FTM was present in 38.25% (184/481) of the participants. Furthermore, FTM were present in 38.6% (142/481) of females and 37.2% (42/481) of males. The study revealed that the presence of the FTM varies between individuals and does not depend on an individual’s sex. Significant differences in the prevalence of the FTM between countries should be carefully evaluated rather than generalizing the results of this Spanish study to other non-Spanish populations. Larger numbers of participants should be enrolled in future studies in order to meet the statistical criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2937702561,"We present a novel quasi-Bayesian method to weight multiple dynamical models by their skill at capturing both potentially non-linear trends and first-order autocorrelated variability of the underlying process, and to make weighted probabilistic projections. We validate the method using a suite of one-at-a-time cross-validation experiments involving Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), its temperature-based index, as well as Korean summer mean maximum temperature. In these experiments the method tends to exhibit superior skill over a trend-only Bayesian model averaging weighting method in terms of weight assignment and probabilistic forecasts. Specifically, mean credible interval width, and mean absolute error of the projections tend to improve. We apply the method to a problem of projecting summer mean maximum temperature change over Korea by the end of the 21st century using a multi-model ensemble. Compared to the trend-only method, the new method appreciably sharpens the probability distribution function (pdf) and increases future most likely, median, and mean warming in Korea. The method is flexible, with a potential to improve forecasts in geosciences and other fields."
https://openalex.org/W2938791161,"Introduction Children and young people (CYP) are encouraged to increase time spent being physically active, especially in moderate and vigorous intensity pursuits. However, there is limited evidence on the prospective association of activity levels with injuries resulting in use of hospital services. We examined the relationship between objectively-measured physical activity (PA) and subsequent injuries resulting in hospital admissions or accident and emergency department (A&E) attendances, using linked electronic hospital records (EHR) from a nationally representative prospective cohort of CYP in Wales and Scotland. Methods We analysed accelerometer-based estimates of moderate to vigorous (MVPA) and vigorous PA (VPA) from 1,585 (777 [46%] boys) seven-year-old Millennium Cohort Study members, living in Wales or Scotland, whose parents consented to linkage of cohort records to EHRs up until their 14th birthday. Negative binomial regression models adjusted by potential individual, household and area-level confounders, were fitted to estimate associations between average daily minutes of MVPA, and VPA (in 10-minute increments), and number of injury-related hospital admissions and/or A&E attendances from age nine to 14 years. Results CYP spent a median of 59.5 and 18.1 minutes in MVPA and VPA/day respectively, with boys significantly more active than girls; 47.3% of children experienced at least one injury-related admission or A&E attendance during the study period. Rates of injury-related hospital admission and/or A&E attendance were positively associated with MVPA and VPA in boys but not in girls: respective adjusted incidence rate ratios (95% CI) for boys: 1.09 (1.01, 1.17) and 1.16 (1.00, 1.34), and for girls: 0.94 (0.86, 1.03) and 0.85 (0.69, 1.04). Conclusion Boys but not girls who engage in more intense PA at age seven years are at higher risk of injury-related hospital admission or A&E attendance when aged nine to 14 years than their less active peers. This may reflect gender differences in the type and associated risks of activities undertaken. EHRs can make a useful contribution to injury surveillance and prevention if routinely augmented with information on context and setting of the injuries sustained. Injury prevention initiatives should not discourage engagement in PA and outdoor play given their over-riding health and social benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2938625956,"Disuse induces adaptations in skeletal muscle, which lead to muscle deterioration. Hindlimb-unloading (HU) is a well-established model to investigate cellular mechanisms responsible for disuse-induced skeletal muscle dysfunction. In myosin heavy chain (MHC) type IIB fibers HU induces a reduction in contraction speed (Vo) and a reduction in the relative myosin light chain 3f (MLC3f) protein content compared with myosin light chain 1f (MLC1f) protein. This study tested the hypothesis that increasing the relative MLC3f protein content via rAd-MLC3f vector delivery would attenuate the HU-induced decline in Vo in single MHC type IIB fibers. Fischer-344 rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, HU for 7 days, and HU for 7 days plus rAd-MLC3f. The semimembranosus muscles were injected with rAd-MLC3f (3.75 x 1011-5 x 1011 ifu/ml) at four days after the initiation of HU. In single MHC type IIB fibers the relative MLC3f content decreased by 25% (12.00±0.60% to 9.06±0.66%) and Vo was reduced by 29% (3.22±0.14fl/s vs. 2.27±0.08fl/s) with HU compared to the control group. The rAd-MLC3f injection resulted in an increase in the relative MLC3f content (12.26±1.19%) and a concomitant increase in Vo (2.90±0.15fl/s) of MHC type IIB fibers. A positive relationship was observed between the percent of MLC3f content and Vo. Maximal isometric force and specific tension were reduced with HU by 49% (741.45±44.24μN to 379.09±23.77μN) and 33% (97.58±4.25kN/m2 to 65.05±2.71kN/m2), respectively compared to the control group. The rAd-MLC3f injection did not change the HU-induced decline in force or specific tension. Collectively, these results indicate that rAd-MLC3f injection rescues hindlimb unloading-induced decline in Vo in MHC type IIB single muscle fibers."
