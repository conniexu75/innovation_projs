https://openalex.org/W2080575348,Interpretation of high-resolution angular distribution measurements of the primary auroral electron flux detected by a rocket probe launched into a visible aurora from Fort Churchill in the fall of 1966 leads to the following conclusions. The auroral electron flux is nearly monoenergetic and has a quasi-trapped as well as a precipitating component. The quasi-trapped flux appears to be limited to a region defined by magnetic-mirror points and multiple electrostatic double layers in the ionosphere. The electrostatic field of the double-layer distribution enhances the aurora by lowering the magnetic-mirror points and supplying energy to the primary auroral electrons.

https://openalex.org/W2002631272,"The ejection of microdroplets from the surface of a freezing supercooled water drop has been observed and photographed. The fragmentation of a freezing drop in the forms of splintering, shattering, or bursting has been known for some time. This newly observed phenomenon of the ejection of numerous microdroplets, the duration of their ejection, and the electrical properties of these droplets suggest a possible mechanism of charge generation in thunderstorms."
https://openalex.org/W2080073134,The hydrolysis rate of isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate (GB) in seawater can be predicted from known or extrapolated rate constants for the reaction between GB and the hydroxo-metal complexes of magnesium and calcium and between GB and the hydroxide ion. At 25 degrees C and pH 7.9 (typical values of many surface waters) the half-life of GB is approximately 30 minutes.

https://openalex.org/W2019130480,"A brief review is given of what the study of galaxies has taught us about properties of the universe. It is assumed that the universe started from a general ""explosion,"" and that the general expansion observed today, as well as the 3 degrees K blackbody radiation, are consequences of this explosion. The present average density in the universe is probably close to the critical value of 10(-29) g/cm(3). Only about 3 percent of this is contained in galaxies; the rest consists probably of intergalactic gas at a temperature between 10(5) and 10(6) degrees K. Observations in our own galaxy indicate that this intergalactic gas is still flowing into it."
https://openalex.org/W1974198202,"The oldest sediment yet sampled from the abyssal margins of South America, late Jurassic (or possibly very early Cretaceous) shallow-water, coarse-grained, calcareous sandstone containing palynomorphs and mollusk prisms, was recovered from a depth of 4400 meters on the seaward scarp of the Demerara Plateau. The sandstone was deposited in a shallow, late Jurassic epicontinental sea after the initial stages of rifting when the newly created Atlantic began to founder."
https://openalex.org/W2026428132,Laboratory experiments show that solid carbon dioxide is an effective trap for ozone at temperatures as high as 156 degrees K. Ultraviolet reflection-absorption spectra of ozone in solid carbon dioxide at 127 degrees K indicate that the ozone observed over the polar cap of Mars may be trapped in solid carbon dioxide.
