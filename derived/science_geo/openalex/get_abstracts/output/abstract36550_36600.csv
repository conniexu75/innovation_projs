https://openalex.org/W1598081743,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is a second messenger of the phosphoinositide system which can mobilize calcium from intracellular stores. Rat cerebellum is an abundant source of a receptor for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Worley, P. F., Baraban, J. M., Supattapone, S., Wilson, V. S., and Snyder, S. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12132-12136). In this study we have solubilized and purified this receptor to apparent homogeneity from rat cerebellum. Crude membrane, detergent-solubilized, and purified receptor preparations display similar selectivity for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate over other inositol phosphates. The purified receptor is globular with a Stokes' radius of approximately 10 nm. Electrophoretic analysis reveals one protein band with an Mr of 260,000. While binding is reversibly inhibited by 300 nM calcium in particulate fractions and detergent-solubilized membranes, the purified protein is not inhibited by calcium concentrations up to 1.5 mM. Inhibition by calcium is reconstituted by addition of detergent-solubilized cerebellar membranes, but not by the cytosolic fraction of cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W1630602822,"There has been considerable controversy regarding the role of oxygen free radicals as important mediators of cell damage in reperfused myocardium. This controversy regards whether superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals are generated on reperfusion and if these radicals actually cause impaired contractile function. In this study, EPR studies using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyroline-n-oxide (DMPO) demonstrate the formation of .OH and R. free radicals in the reperfused heart. EPR signals of DMPO-OH, aN = aH = 14.9 G, and DMPO-R aN = 15.8 G aH = 22.8 G are observed, with peak concentrations during the first minute of reperfusion. It is demonstrated that these radicals are derived from .O2- since reperfusion in the presence of enzymatically active recombinant human superoxide dismutase markedly reduced the formation of these signals while inactive recombinant human superoxide dismutase had no effect. On reperfusion with perfusate pretreated to remove adventitial iron, the concentration of the DMPO-OH signal was increased 2-fold and a 4-fold decrease in the DMPO-R signal was observed demonstrating that iron-mediated Fenton chemistry occurs. Hearts reperfused with recombinant human superoxide dismutase exhibited improved contractile function in parallel with the marked reduction in measured free radicals. In order to determine if the reperfusion free radical burst results in impaired contractile function, simultaneous measurements of free radical generation and contractile function were performed. A direct relationship between free radical generation and subsequent impaired contractile function was observed. These studies suggest that superoxide derived .OH and R. free radicals are generated in the reperfused heart via Fenton chemistry. These radicals appear to be key mediators of myocardial reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W1567770396,"Transformation of leukotriene (LT) A4 into leukotriene C4 has been found to be carried out by human platelets in a rather efficient manner. LTC4 was characterized by a combination of high performance liquid chromatography, UV spectrophotometry, use of labeled precursor, guinea pig ileum bioassay, and enzyme immunoassay. LTA4 metabolism was found to be substrate-dependent, time-dependent, and proportional to platelet concentration even at sub- or supraphysiological levels (0.0019-1 X 10(9) platelets/ml). Neither plasma alone nor the supernatant of resting or activated platelets was found to catalyze the production of LTC4 in the presence or in the absence of reduced glutathione. These data suggest that platelets contain a glutathione S-transferase specific for LTC4 biosynthesis. The formation of LTC4 was greatly enhanced when LTA4 was incubated with platelets in the presence of albumin. Low concentrations of albumin (2-4 g/liter) stabilized LTA4 to an extent that conversion into LTC4 by the platelets could be detected after 1 h of incubation. The possible intercellular transfer of LTA4 between neutrophils and platelets was tested. The production of LTC4 by neutrophils was greatly enhanced in the presence of platelets. Furthermore, the supernatant of neutrophils stimulated with the calcium ionophore contained a short-lived acid-labile substance which was converted by the platelets into LTC4. When platelets were prelabeled with [35S]cysteine to allow intracellular synthesis of [35S]glutathione, the coincubation of both cell types challenged with the calcium ionophore resulted in the production of [35S] LTC4. These data indicate that platelets can produce large amounts of LTC4 from neutrophil-derived LTA4. They also suggest that such interactions may occur in vivo and that platelets could be an important contribution to the generation of the biologically active LTC4."

https://openalex.org/W1560152642,"The DNA helicase activity associated with purified simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor (T) antigen has been examined. A variety of DNA substrates were used to characterize this ATP-dependent activity. Linear single-stranded M13 DNA containing short duplex regions at both ends was used to show that SV40 T antigen helicase displaced the short, annealed fragment by unwinding in a 3' to 5' direction. Three different partial duplex structures consisting of 71-, 343-, and 851-nucleotide long fragments annealed to M13 single-stranded circular DNA were used to show that SV40 T antigen can readily unwind short and long duplex regions with almost equal facility. ATP and MgCl2 were required for this reaction. With the exception of GTP, dGTP, and CTP, the other common nucleoside triphosphates substituted for ATP with varied efficiency, while adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) was inactive. The T antigen helicase activity was also examined using completely duplex DNA fragments (approximately 300 base pairs) with or without the SV40 origin sequence as substrates. In reactions containing small amounts (0.6 ng) of DNA, the ATP-dependent unwinding of duplex DNA fragments occurred with no dependence on the origin sequence. This reaction was stimulated 5- to 6-fold by the addition of the Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein. When competitor DNA was added so that the ratio of SV40 T antigen to DNA was reduced 1000-fold, only DNA fragments containing a functional SV40 origin of replication were unwound. This reaction was dependent on ATP, MgCl2, and a DNA-binding protein, and was stimulated by inorganic phosphate or creatine phosphate. The origin sequence requirements for the unwinding reaction were the same as those for replication (the 64-base pair sequence present at T antigen binding site 2). Thus, under specified conditions, only duplex DNA fragments containing an intact SV40 core origin were unwound. In contrast, unwinding of partially duplex segments of DNA flanked by single-stranded regions can occur with no sequence specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1525694901,"Two tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) cDNA clones were isolated from mouse cDNA libraries and characterized. The sequence coding for mature mouse tPA protein including its 29-residue signal peptide, as well as that for the 3‘ and part of the 5‘-nontranslated regions of the mRNA was determined. The mature protein consists of 530 amino acids and is encoded by a transcript of approximately 2800 nucleotides. The mouse tPA protein has 81% homology with its human counterpart, and amino acid sequence conservations suggest that the multidomain-like structure found for human tPA is maintained in the mouse enzyme. The tPA cDNA has been used as a probe to analyze tPA gene expression during F9 cell differentiation. tPA mRNA is not detected in F9 stem cells. When F9 cells are induced to differentiate with retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, tPA mRNA accumulates. We demonstrate that this induction occurs at least in part because of an increase in tPA gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1578617720,"Treatment of quiescent 3T3 cells with sodium orthovanadate induces a 10-fold stimulation of a kinase that phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6. The kinase in crude extracts is extremely labile and rapidly loses activity when incubated at 37 degrees C. This reaction is blocked by phosphatase inhibitors such as p-nitrophenyl phosphate and beta-glycerophosphate, suggesting that dephosphorylation of the kinase leads to its inactivation (Novak-Hofer, I., and Thomas, G. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10314-10319). After three steps of purification the kinase can be separated from greater than 99% of the cellular phosphorylase a phosphatases. At this stage the kinase preparation is almost completely stable but can be inactivated by readdition of specific column fractions that contain both phosphorylase phosphatase and protease activity. However, employing a number of specific inhibitors it is shown that the inactivating agent in these fractions is a protein phosphatase. Furthermore, the physical and enzymatic properties of the kinase inactivator argue that it can be classified as a type 2A phosphatase. These results are consistent with the finding that the purified catalytic subunits of phosphatase type 1 and type 2A also inactivate the kinase. At equivalent phosphorylase a phosphatase activities, the type 2A catalytic subunit is 3 times more potent than the type 1 enzyme in carrying out this reaction. These data indicate that the major S6 kinase inactivator in 3T3 cell extracts is a type 2A phosphatase, supporting the hypothesis that the orthovanadate-stimulated S6 kinase is regulated in vivo by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1508702670,"The ATPase of SV40 large T antigen (T antigen) which is essential for the replication of SV40 minichromosomes was recently shown to be functionally related to a newly discovered DNA helicase activity. The T antigen helicase unwinds DNA duplices of several kilobase pairs in a reaction depending on the presence of hydrolyzable ribo- or deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The in vitro rate of movement through duplex DNA was found to be about 100 base pairs/min at 37 degrees C. For DNA unwinding, T antigen requires a 3'-single strand extension of a partially double-stranded substrate and invades the double strand section processively, in a 3' to 5' direction. The minimum length of the single-stranded tail was determined to be less than 5 nucleotides. Unwinding studies in the presence of the Escherichia coli single strand-specific DNA-binding protein and competition experiments indicate that T antigen helicase binds preferentially at the single-stranded/double-stranded DNA junction. This DNA structure is therefore proposed to serve as an entry site for the T antigen helicase. Previously reported data suggest that T antigen is the replicative helicase of the SV40 minichromosome. The results presented here are consistent with these findings and imply that T antigen migrates actively and processively along the template for the leading strand."
https://openalex.org/W1589242674,"A lambda gt11 cDNA library, prepared from porcine submaxillary gland mRNA, was screened with anti-apomucin IgG, and five antibody-reactive phage were isolated. The phage with the largest cDNA insert, designated lambda PSM103, was further characterized. Its fusion protein reacted with anti-apomucin IgG and was used to affinity purify antibodies that specifically reacted with apomucin, indicating that the protein shares antigenic determinants with apomucin. The nucleotide sequence of 1510 bases in the 3.7-kilobase cDNA insert of lambda PSM103 has been established, thereby giving a deduced amino acid sequence of 503 residues in apomucin, or about 45% of the molecule. The deduced sequence of the apomucin polypeptide was found to contain 4.8 tandemly repeated, identical sequences of 81 residues each. The presence of these uniquely repeated sequences was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion of DNA derived from lambda PSM103. The repeat sequence was also confirmed in apomucin by the isolation of an 81-residue tryptic peptide with an amino acid composition and an amino-terminal amino acid sequence (up to 44 residues) identical to those of the tandem repeat. Moreover, the peptide was isolated in 760% yield, indicating that the tandem repeat occurs at least eight times in apomucin. The presence of such a long repetitive region in the gene for apomucin raises the possibility for considerable polymorphism in the gene and a corresponding size heterogeneity of apomucin. The predicted secondary structure of the 503 residues confirms the earlier proposal that apomucin is an extended, nonglobular polypeptide. Although the sequences around 192 serine and threonine residues have been established in apomucin, a recognition sequence for the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase that initiates glycosylation of apomucin is not evident, except that the glycosylated residues occur in turns."
https://openalex.org/W1487828245,"The 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor purified from rabbit skeletal muscle contains four polypeptide components of 175,000 Da (nonreduced)/150,000 Da (reduced), 170,000, 52,000, and 32,000 Da (Leung, A. T., Imagawa, T., and Campbell, K. P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7943-7946). A monoclonal antibody specific to the 52,000-Da polypeptide component of the dihydropyridine receptor has been produced and used in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments to demonstrate that the 52,000-Da polypeptide is an integral subunit of the purified dihydropyridine receptor. Peptide mapping experiments with 32P-labeled dihydropyridine receptor have also demonstrated that the 52,000-Da polypeptide is distinct from and not a proteolytic fragment of the 170,000-Da subunit. Densitometric scanning of Coomassie Blue-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of the purified dihydropyridine receptor has demonstrated that the 52,000-Da polypeptide exists in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with the 170,000-, 175,000/150,000-, and 32,000-Da subunits of the dihydropyridine receptor. Electron microscopy of the freeze-dried, rotary-shadowed dihydropyridine receptor has shown that the preparation contains a homogeneous population of 16 x 22-nm ovoidal particles large enough to contain all four polypeptides of the dihydropyridine receptor. The particles have two distinct components of similar size which may represent the location in the molecule of the two larger subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1483481578,"An alpha subunit cDNA of the mouse nicotinic acetylcholine receptor under transcriptional control of the Rous Sarcoma virus long terminal repeat was transfected into and expressed in a quail fibroblast cell line. The biosynthesis and post-translational modification of the alpha subunit protein made in this heterologous system have been studied using immunoprecipitation and ligand binding assays. The polypeptide is present at high steady-state levels and inserted in the correct transmembrane orientation. However, in the absence of assembly with other subunits the alpha subunit is confined to an intracellular membrane compartment and is not transported to the plasma membrane. Twenty percent of the newly synthesized alpha subunit acquired high affinity alpha bungarotoxin binding in a time-dependent process within 20 min of translation. Sucrose gradient fractionation demonstrated that both the polypeptide and toxin binding forms of the alpha subunit have a sedimentation coefficient of 5 s suggesting the absence of stable homo-oligomers. Quantitative binding assays demonstrated that the apparent affinity and rate of association of alpha bungarotoxin to the unassembled alpha subunit are greater than for native receptor. On the other hand, the affinities for the small ligands D-tubocurarine and gallamine are 10(3) lower than for native receptor; no detectable binding was observed for decamethonium, hexamethonium, or carbamylcholine. Thus, the acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit, independent of other subunits of the receptor, acquires a mature conformation and high affinity alpha bungarotoxin binding when expressed in a quail fibroblast cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1501868120,"Nuclear factor III (NF-III, origin recognition protein C) is a cellular DNA binding protein that has high affinity for a DNA sequence contained within the adenovirus origin of DNA replication. We have purified NF-III more than 760-fold from HeLa nuclear extracts by a combination of conventional methods and DNA recognition site affinity chromatography. The NF-III polypeptide has an apparent molecular weight of 92,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sedimentation coefficient of the native protein is 3.1 S, and the Stokes radius is 61 A. These values indicate that NF-III exists in solution as a somewhat asymmetric monomer. Purified NF-III binds specifically to a sequence within domain C of the adenovirus origin of replication and stimulates initiation of adenovirus DNA replication in in vitro reconstitution experiments. NF-III also binds specifically to a sequence element in the human histone H2B gene that is required for H2B-specific mRNA synthesis in vitro. Thus, NF-III may function as an activator of both viral DNA replication and cellular transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1589214741,"A study of the single turnover kinetics of the reaction between oxycytochrome P-450cam and reduced putidaredoxin was performed using the inhibitor metyrapone to trap the cytochrome immediately after release of the product, 5-exo-hydroxycamphor. EPR determinations of the concentrations of reduced putidaredoxin and ferric metyrapone-bound cytochrome at the same time points showed that there is no time lag between the oxidation of reduced putidaredoxin and the appearance of metyrapone-bound cytochrome. This implies that the rate constant for electron transfer is smaller than the rate constant for the later processes involved in product formation and release, lumped into a single step. Taking this restriction into account and doing computer simulation of absorbance versus time curves, previously obtained at various putidaredoxin concentrations using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, allowed bounds to be determined for rate constants of the processes within the reaction. At 4 degrees C in buffer at pH 7.4 with 0.50 M KCl, the rate constant for the bimolecular association of the two enzymes is between 3 and 20/microM.s; the rate constant for dissociation is between 12 and 600/s; the rate constant for electron transfer is between 60 and 100/s; and the rate constant for the later processes is at least 200/s."
https://openalex.org/W1546137810,"The recA protein of Escherichia coli is a DNA-dependent ATPase. In the absence of DNA, the rate of recA protein-promoted ATP hydrolysis drops 2000-fold, exhibiting an apparent kcat of approximately 0.015 min-1. This DNA-independent activity can be stimulated to levels approximating those observed with DNA by adding high concentrations (approximately 2M) of a wide variety of salts. The increase in ATP hydrolysis appears to require the minimal interaction of three to four ions with recA protein. The active species in ATP hydrolysis is an aggregate of recA protein. There appears to be little or no cooperativity with respect to ATP binding (Hill coefficient = 1.0). The salt-stimulated ATP hydrolysis reaction is dependent upon Mg2+ ions and is optimal between pH 7.0 and 8.0. In many respects, the high salt concentration appears to be functionally mimicking DNA in activating the recA protein ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1576943367,"We studied the influence of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on diacylglycerol phosphorylation in Swiss 3T3 cells. Rates of incorporation of 32P into phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) were determined in prelabeled cells into which sn-1,2-didecanoylglycerol (diC10) had been introduced. PDGF stimulated the formation of [32P]PA and -PtdIns from endogenous substrates but decreased the formation of [32P]PA10 and -PtdIns10. Direct measurements of diacylglycerol phosphorylation in lysates of quiescent and stimulated cells showed that PDGF stimulated the phosphorylation of endogenous diacylglycerol 2-fold in parallel with diacylglycerol accumulation but decreased by 50% the phosphorylation of diC10. Total diacylglycerol kinase activity, measured in a mixed micellar assay, was not changed by PDGF treatment. The maximum activity of diacylglycerol kinase exceeded that needed to phosphorylate all of the endogenous diacylglycerol, suggesting that the PDGF-dependent increase in diacylglycerol mass would account for the increase in PA formation. The increased mass of diacylglycerol also could explain the inhibition of diC10 phosphorylation, via substrate competition. The predominant species of endogenous diacylglycerol was 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (18:0/20:4 diacylglycerol). In mixed micelles, the rate of phosphorylation of 18:0/20:4 diacylglycerol was 8-fold higher than that of diC10, and the 18:0/20:4 species competed with diC10 for phosphorylation. Studies showed that a membrane-bound enzyme accounted for the PDGF effect on PA formation; there was no evidence for translocation of cytosolic enzyme to the membrane. The results support these conclusions: 1) PDGF stimulates the phosphorylation of cellular diacylglycerol by promoting a transient accumulation of this lipid. 2) The stimulated phosphorylation is catalyzed by a diacylglycerol kinase that preferentially phosphorylates 18:0/20:4 diacylglycerol over diC10. 3) The diacylglycerol kinase responsible for the PDGF effect is membrane-bound."
https://openalex.org/W1587607464,"The complete amino acid sequence of 6-phospho-fructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase from rat liver was determined by direct analysis of the S-carboxamidomethyl protein. A complete set of nonoverlapping peptides was produced by cleavage with a combination of cyanogen bromide and specific proteolytic enzymes. The active enzyme is a dimer of two identical polypeptide chains composed of 470 amino acids each. The NH2-terminal amino acid residue of the polypeptide chain was shown to be N-acetylserine by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the purified N-terminal tetradecapeptide isolated after cleavage of the intact S-carboxamidomethylated protein with lysyl endoproteinase (Achromobacter protease I). Alignment of the set of unique peptides was accomplished by the analysis of selected overlapping peptides generated by proteolytic cleavage of the intact protein and the larger purified cyanogen bromide peptides with trypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and lysyl endoproteinase. Four nonoverlapping peptides were aligned by comparison with the amino acid sequence predicted from a partial cDNA clone encoding amino acid positions 166-470 of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (Colosia, A.D., Lively, M., El-Maghrabi, M. R., and Pilkis, S. J. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 143, 1092-1098). The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA corroborated the peptide sequence determined by direct methods. A search of the Protein Identification Resource protein sequence database revealed that the overall amino acid sequence appears to be unique since no obviously homologous sequences were identified. However, a 100-residue segment of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (residues 250-349), including the active site histidine residue of the bisphosphatase domain, was found to be homologous to the active site regions of yeast phosphoglycerate mutase and human bisphosphoglycerate mutase."
https://openalex.org/W1570089337,"The NADPH-supported enzymatic reduction of molecular oxygen by ferredoxin-ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase was investigated. The ESR spin trapping technique was employed to identify the free radical metabolites of oxygen. The spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was used to trap and identify the oxygen-derived free radicals. [17O]Oxygen was employed to demonstrate that the oxygen-centered radicals arose from molecular oxygen. From the data, the following scheme is proposed: (Formula:see text). The formation of the free hydroxyl radical during the reduction of oxygen was demonstrated with quantitative competition experiments. The hydroxyl radical abstracted hydrogen from ethanol or formate, and the resulting scavenger-derived free radical was trapped with known rate constants. If H2O2 was added to the enzymatic reaction, a stimulation of the production of the hydroxyl radical was obtained. This stimulation was manifested in both the concentration and the rate of formation of the DMPO/hydroxyl radical adduct. Catalase was shown to inhibit formation of the hydroxyl radical adduct, further supporting the formation of hydrogen peroxide as an intermediate during the reduction of oxygen. All three components, ferredoxin, ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase, and NADPH, were required for reduction. Ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase reduces ferredoxin, which in turn is responsible for the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide and ultimately the hydroxyl radical. The effect of transition metal chelators on the DMPO/hydroxyl radical adduct concentration suggests that the reduction of chelated iron by ferredoxin is responsible for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to the hydroxyl radical via Fenton-type chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1554637595,"Heat shock proteins are induced at normal temperatures by oxidants and during reoxygenation following hypoxia. We now report cyanide-resistant O2 consumption increased 30-50% in rat lungs exposed to heat shock or reoxygenation following hypoxia. The synthesis of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, but not Mn superoxide dismutase, was increased in rat lung slices by in vivo hyperthermia (39 degrees C), by in vitro heat shock (41 degrees C), and during incubation of lung slices with the Cu chelator diethyldithiocarbamate, which decreased the activity of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase. The heat shock-induced increase in Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase developed 2 h later than the induction of heat shock proteins and was not blocked by actinomycin D. The rates of synthesis of both superoxide dismutases were decreased 50% by hypoxia and failed to increase during reoxygenation. During hypoxia the activity of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase decreased about 50%, but the activity of Mn superoxide dismutase remained unchanged. We conclude that hyperthermia increases the synthesis of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, the synthesis of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase and Mn superoxide dismutase are not coordinately regulated by hyperthermia or by the oxidant stress produced by lowering the activity of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, and the synthesis of heat shock proteins and Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase are regulated at different levels of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1945745853,"Light stimulates the hydrolysis of exogenous, [3H]inositol-labeled phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) added to squid photoreceptor membranes, releasing inositol trisphosphate (InsP3). At free calcium levels of 0.05 microM or greater, hydrolysis of the labeled lipid is stimulated up to 4-fold by GTP and light together, but not separately. This activity is the biochemical counterpart of observations on intact retina showing that a rhodopsin-activated GTP-binding protein is involved in visual transduction in invertebrates, and that InsP3 release is correlated with visual excitation and adaptation. Using an in vitro assay, we investigated the calcium and GTP dependence of the phospholipase activity. At calcium concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 microM, some hydrolysis occurs independently of GTP and light, with a light- and GTP-activated component superimposed. At 1 microM calcium there is no background activity, and hydrolysis absolutely requires both GTP and light. Ion exchange chromatography on Dowex 1 (formate form) of the water-soluble products released at 1 microM calcium reveals that the product is almost entirely InsP3. Invertebrate rhodopsin is homologous in sequence and function to vertebrate visual pigment, which modulates the concentration of cyclic GMP through the mediation of the GTP-binding protein transducin. While there is some evidence that light also modulates PtdInsP2 content in vertebrate photoreceptors, the case for its involvement in phototransduction is stronger for the invertebrate systems. The results reported here support the scheme of rhodopsin----GTP-binding protein----phospholipase C activation in invertebrate photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1553223526,"We have expressed the mouse platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor cDNA under transcriptional control of simian virus 40 promoter in Chinese hamster ovary cells, a cell type that lacks PDGF receptors. Stable transfectants expressed receptor protein that was recognized by antireceptor antibodies. PDGF stimulated a diverse group of responses in the transfected cells including tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and a 32-kDa cellular substrate, receptor internalization, phosphoinositide turnover, cytoplasmic alkalinization, changes in the intracellular calcium concentration, thymidine uptake into DNA, and cell division. There were no responses to PDGF in the control Chinese hamster ovary cells. After prolonged exposure to PDGF, the transfectants became refractory to subsequent PDGF stimulation and the receptor protein was no longer detectable. These data validate the authenticity of the PDGF receptor cDNA, show that transfection of a single type of receptor cDNA sequence confers PDGF sensitivity to a diverse group of cellular responses, and demonstrate that effector molecules that mediate the PDGF responses are present in cells that lack PDGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1659779931,"Pyridoxal-P has been shown to be an activator of the spinach leaf ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. It has a higher apparent affinity than the physiological activator 3-phosphoglycerate but only activates the enzyme activity 6-fold whereas 3-phosphoglycerate gives a 25-fold activation. Reductive phosphopyridoxylation of the spinach leaf enzyme results in enzyme having less dependence on the presence of activator for activity. Labeled pyridoxal-P is incorporated into both the 54- and 51-kilodalton subunits of the spinach leaf enzyme. The incorporation is inhibited by the presence of either 3-phosphoglycerate or the allosteric inhibitor, inorganic phosphate, thus suggesting that pyridoxal phosphate is covalently bound to the allosteric activator site. The pyridoxal phosphate is bound to an epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue. The phosphopyridoxylated enzyme is more resistant to phosphate inhibition than the unmodified form. The modified 51-kDa subunit has been digested with trypsin, and the peptide containing the labeled pyridoxal phosphate has been purified via high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced. Comparison of this sequence with the deduced amino acid sequence of a rice endosperm cDNA clone indicates that the putative allosteric site of the 51-kDa subunit is close to the carboxyl-terminal. This is in contrast to what had been demonstrated for the position of the activator site of the Escherichia coli ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase which was shown to be close to the amino-terminal of the subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1573974844,"Neurotensin receptors were solubilized from mouse brain using the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS). The binding of 125I-labeled [Tyr3]neurotensin to the soluble fraction was time-dependent, saturable, and reversible. Unlabeled neurotensin and its analogues acetylneurotensin (8-13), neurotensin (9-13), and neurotensin (1-12) competitively antagonized the binding of 125I-labeled [Tyr3]neurotensin to CHAPS-solubilized extracts with relative potencies similar to those observed with membrane-bound receptors. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data indicated that the soluble extract contained a single class of neurotensin binding sites with a Kd of 0.36 nM and a Bm of 63 fmol/mg. As already observed with membrane-bound receptors, the affinity of neurotensin for the soluble binding activity was decreased by Na+ ions. By contrast, soluble receptors were no longer sensitive to GTP and the antihistamine drug levocabastine. A molecular weight of about 100,000 was determined for soluble neurotensin receptors both under native conditions by gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 34 and under denaturating conditions by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after photoaffinity labeling."
https://openalex.org/W1508094043,"Immunoblot studies of synaptic membranes isolated from rat brain using antibodies raised against a previously purified glutamate-binding protein (GBP) indicated labeling of an approximately 70-kDa protein band. Since the antibodies used were raised against a 14-kDa GBP, the present studies were undertaken to explore the possibility that the 14-kDa protein may have been a proteolytic fragment of a larger Mr protein in synaptic membranes. Protease activity during protein purification was prevented by introducing five protease inhibitors, and a three-step purification procedure was developed that yielded a high degree of purification of glutamate-binding proteins. The major protein enriched in the most highly purified fractions was a 71-kDa glycoprotein, but a 63-kDa protein was co-purified during most steps of the isolation procedure. The glutamate-binding characteristics of these isolated protein fractions were very similar to those previously described for the 14-kDa GBP, including estimated dissociation constants for L-glutamate binding of 0.25 and 1 microM, inhibition of glutamate binding by azide and cyanide, and a selectivity of the ligand binding site for L-glutamate and L-aspartate. The neuroexcitatory analogs of L-glutamate and L-aspartate, ibotenate, quisqualate, and D-glutamate, inhibited L-[3H]glutamate binding to the isolated proteins, as did the antagonist of L-glutamate-induced neuronal excitation, L-glutamate diethylester. On the basis of the lack of any detectable glutamate-related enzyme activity associated with the isolated proteins and the presence of distinguishing sensitivities to analogs that inhibit glutamate transport carriers in synaptic membranes, it is proposed that the 71-kDa protein may be a component of a physiologic glutamate receptor complex in neuronal membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1480796280,"Protein I, the major outer membrane protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, is a voltage-dependent anion channel which can translocate from the gonococcus into human cells. Since granule exocytosis from neutrophils is regulated by ion fluxes, we examined the effect of protein I on neutrophil activation. Pretreatment with protein I (250 nM) impaired degranulation from neutrophils: beta-glucuronidase release decreased to 27 +/- 6% S.E. of cells treated with N-f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP, 0.1 microM) and to 13 +/- 4% of cells treated with leukotriene B4 (LTB4, 0.1 microM); lysozyme release decreased to 52 +/- 17% of fMLP-treated cells and 22 +/- 9% of LTB4-treated cells. Morphometric analysis was consistent: control neutrophils increased their surface membrane after fMLP (43.3 +/- 5.6 microns relative perimeter versus 71.4 +/- 3.7 microns) while protein I-treated neutrophils did not (29.4 +/- 2 (S.E.) microns relative perimeter versus 34 +/- 4 microns). Enzyme release after exposure to phorbol myristate acetate was not affected (lysozyme: 86 +/- 27% of control). Cell/cell aggregation in response to fMLP was inhibited by treatment with protein I. However, generation of O2 was not affected. Protein I altered the surface membrane potential (Oxonol V): protein I evoked a transient membrane hyperpolarization which was not inhibited by furosemide. After exposure to fMLP, protein I-treated neutrophils underwent a furosemide-sensitive hyperpolarization rather than the usual depolarization. Protein I did not alter increments in [Ca]i (Fura-2) stimulated by fMLP (460 +/- 99 nM (S.E.) versus 377 +/- 44 nM) nor decrements in [pH]i (7.22 +/- 0.04 S.E. versus 7.22 +/- 0.02, bis-(carboxy-ethyl)carboxyfluorescein). The results suggest that degranulation and O2 generation have separate ionic requirements and that protein I interrupts the activation sequence proximal to activation of protein kinase C."

We have cloned and characterized the gene for MEP from NIH-3T3 cells. This cosmid clone (pcosMMEP), containing the unique 12,000-base pair mouse MEP gene, has been transfected into monkey kidney (CV-1) cells and human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells. The stable A4MEP transfectants produce mouse MEP that is an active cathepsin which is secreted, glycosylated, and processed intracellularly to lower molecular weight forms as in the wild-type NIH-3T3 cells. The CVMEP cells (nontransformed phenotype) produce quantities of mouse MEP similar to that found in NIH-3T3 cells, whereas the A4MEP cells (transformed phenotype) produce greater amounts of MEP similar to the levels seen in Kirsten virus-transformed NIH-3T3 cells. The MEP mRNAs from both mouse cells and stably transfected human cells are the same size and have the same single major site for initiation of transcription, indicating that the cloned mouse MEP promoter is active in transfected cells."

The enzyme has a native molecular weight of 230,000 and a sedimentation coefficient of 9.3 S. Its subunit molecular weight derived from electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gels is 58,900, and it has a unique N-terminal sequence for the first 25 amino acids, which indicate that the native enzyme is composed of 4 homologous subunits. It is insensitive to sulfhydryl reagents and EDTA and can be heated to 60 degrees C for 60 min without loss of activity. The enzyme requires Mg2+ for activity, is highly specific for dGTP among the canonical deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and has a unique activity among nucleoside triphosphatases in that the products of the reaction are deoxyguanosine and inorganic tripolyphosphate. Preliminary evidence suggest that this enzyme is responsible for the optA mutant phenotype first described by Saito and Richardson (Saito, H., and Richardson, C.C. (1981) J. Virol. 37, 343-351)."
https://openalex.org/W1591034999,"The structure of Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I (AvFdI) has been extensively characterized by a variety of techniques. Although its physiological function is unknown, it has long been implicated as being involved in electron donation to nitrogenase. Here we report that the AvFdI gene (fdxA) has been cloned from an EcoRI digest lambda library using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe and that its sequence has been determined. The amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence is identical to the previously published protein sequence. Analysis of the promoter region indicates that AvFdI is not a nif specific gene product. A mutant of A. vinelandii has been constructed which is identical to the wild-type, at the DNA level, except that the fdxA gene has been interrupted by insertion of a kanamycin cartridge. This mutant, called LM100, does not synthesize AvFdI but does synthesize the Fe and MoFe proteins of nitrogenase and grows at wild-type rates under N2-fixing conditions. This demonstrates that AvFdI is not required for N2 fixation by A. vinelandii. There is a small acidic protein, which is present in wild-type A. vinelandii, whose level is dramatically increased in LM100. The nature of this protein is under further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1584449567,"By using porcine elastase I cDNA as a probe, we have isolated two different but closely related cDNAs encoding elastase-like proteases from a human pancreatic cDNA library. The amino acid sequences deduced from the cloned cDNA sequences showed 56-61% identity with those of both pancreatic elastases I and II, similar to the homology between elastases I and II. The active form of the elastase-like proteases appeared to be composed of 242 amino acids and preceded by a signal peptide and propeptide of 28 amino acids. Dot blot analysis of various tissue mRNAs demonstrated that the genes for the cloned cDNAs are expressed at a high level only in the pancreas. In addition, sequence analysis of the cloned genomic genes corresponding to one of the cDNAs showed that they are members of the elastase gene family. These results indicate that the two enzymes encoded by the cDNAs should be classified into a third class of elastase isozyme. Therefore, we designated them as human pancreatic elastases IIIA and IIIB. They strongly resembled cholesterol-binding pancreatic protease, suggesting that they may possess not only a digestive function but also function(s) related to cholesterol metabolism or transport in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1601695596,"We have previously characterized a cellular thyroid hormone-binding protein (p55) that is found concentrated on the lumenal face of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope (Cheng, S.-y., Hasumura, S., Willingham, M.C., and Pastan, I. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 947-951). To understand the role p55 plays in thyroid hormone action, we examined the regulation of p55 by 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). Rat pituitary tumor GH3 cells cultured in regular medium, thyroid hormone-depleted medium (Td medium), or Td medium supplemented with 50 nM T3 (Td + T3 medium) were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against p55. Treatment with T3 caused a fall in p55 levels. Poly(A+) RNA from cells cultured in regular, Td, or Td + T3 medium was hybridized to a cDNA from p55. T3 withdrawal or addition had no effect on p55 mRNA levels. Furthermore, the initial rates of synthesis of p55 from cells cultured in regular, Td, and Td + T3 were found to be similar. However, analysis of the decay curves from cells in which p55 was pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine indicated that p55 is 2-fold less stable in T3 containing medium. These results indicated that down-regulation of p55 by T3 occurs at the post-translational level. Since DNA sequence analysis indicates that p55 is identical to protein disulfide isomerase and the beta-subunit of prolyl-4-hydroxylase, T3 may mediate its effects on the synthesis, secretion, and/or transport of proteins via p55."
https://openalex.org/W1507146886,"Radiation inactivation and target analysis were used to determine the molecular mass of the binding sites for high density lipoproteins (HDL) on membranes prepared from human fibroblasts. These membrane binding sites shared characteristics with the previously described HDL binding sites on whole fibroblasts in tissue culture. They exhibited the same affinity for HDL, the same ligand specificity, and the same sensitivity to proteolytic agents. They were also up-regulated by cholesterol loading of the cells. Kinetics of HDL dissociation from membrane binding sites could not be described by a single exponential function, indicating that HDL probably bind to multiple classes of sites on fibroblast membranes. After exposure to ionizing radiation, these sites decreased in number as an apparent single exponential function of radiation dose, corresponding to an average molecular mass of 16,000 +/- 1,000 Da, which is smaller than any known cell-surface receptor protein. These data indicate that HDL binding sites on fibroblast membranes are not classical receptors in that they are kinetically heterogeneous and small in molecular mass."
https://openalex.org/W1493278869,"MAK11 is a gene necessary for the maintenance of killer M1 double-stranded RNA, but not for other cellular double-stranded RNAs (L-A, L-BC, T, W). The DNA sequence of this gene revealed a 1407-base pair open reading frame, which corresponds to a 54-kDa protein. The C-terminal region is lysine-rich and is necessary for mak11-complementing activity. The N-terminal 24 amino acids of the open reading frame include 16 hydrophobic amino acids, 4 basic residues, and 4 neutral amino acids; this sequence could span a membrane. We constructed a MAK11-lacZ fusion that includes the entire MAK11 protein and complements the mak11-1 mutation. The fusion protein was localized in a membrane fraction as shown by centrifugation in Percoll gradients. The fusion protein could be released from the membrane fraction by salt washing. Western blotting of protein, isolated from the membrane fraction and purified by p-aminophenyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside-agarose column chromatography, revealed a fusion protein monomer of 170 kDa which agrees with the predicted molecular weight. While the mak11-1 mutation results in specific loss of M1 double-stranded RNA without any apparent growth defect, replacing a 792-base pair internal EcoRV fragment of MAK11 with the URA3 gene (gene disruption) resulted in a lethal mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2129194997,"Respiratory deficient mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae previously assigned to complementation group G59 are pleiotropically deficient in respiratory chain components and in mitochondrial ATPase. This phenotype has been shown to be a consequence of mutations in a nuclear gene coding for mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase. The structural gene (MSL1) coding for the mitochondrial enzyme has been cloned by transformation of two different G59 mutants with genomic libraries of wild type yeast nuclear DNA. The cloned gene has been sequenced and shown to code for a protein of 894 residues with a molecular weight of 101,936. The amino-terminal sequence (30-40 residues) has a large percentage of basic and hydroxylated residues suggestive of a mitochondrial import signal. The cloned MSL1 gene was used to construct a strain in which 1 kb of the coding sequence was deleted and substituted with the yeast LEU2 gene. Mitochondrial extracts obtained from the mutant carrying the disrupted MSL1::LEU2 allele did not catalyze acylation of mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA even though other tRNAs were normally charged. These results confirmed the correct identification of MSL1 as the structural gene for mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase. Mutations in MSL1 affect the ability of yeast to grow on nonfermentable substrates but are not lethal indicating that the cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase is encoded by a different gene. The primary sequence of yeast mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase has been compared to other bacterial and eukaryotic synthetases. Significant homology has been found between the yeast enzyme and the methionyl- and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases of Escherichia coli. The most striking primary sequence homology occurs in the amino-terminal regions of the three proteins encompassing some 150 residues. Several smaller domains in the more internal regions of the polypeptide chains, however, also exhibit homology. These observations have been interpreted to indicate that the three synthetases may represent a related subset of enzymes originating from a common ancestral gene."
https://openalex.org/W1486049343,"To clarify the mechanism of inhibition of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase by cardiac glycosides, we tried to see if ouabain binding alters the properties of the binding sites for Na+, K+, and ATP. Ouabain was bound in the presence of either Na+ + MgATP or MgPi. Ligand-induced changes in the rate of release of ouabain from the two resulting complexes were used as signals to determine the affinities, the numbers, and the interactions of the ligand binding sites. Because the two complexes showed differences in the properties of their ligand binding sites, and since neither complex could be converted to the other, it is concluded that either the enzyme has two dissimilar but mutually exclusive ouabain sites or that it can be frozen in two distinct conformations by ouabain. The following ligand sites were identified on the two complexes: 1) two coexisting ATP sites (K0.5 values, 0.1 and 2 mM) representing altered states of the catalytic and the regulatory sites of the native enzyme; 2) mutually exclusive Na+ and K+ sites whose affinities (K0.5 values, 1.3 mM Na+ and 0.1 mM K+) suggested their identities with the high affinity uptake sites of the native enzyme; and 3) coexisting low affinity Na+ and K+ sites (K0.5 values, 0.2-0.6 M) representing either the discharge sites, or the regulatory sites, or the access channels of the native enzyme. The data suggest that the inability of the ouabain-complexed enzyme to participate in the normal reaction cycle is not because of its lack of ligand binding sites but most likely due to ouabain-induced disruptions of interprotomer site-site interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1552386243,"Monoclonal antibodies to chick type X collagen have been used to study the structure, biosynthesis, and location of type X in cartilage. The antibodies were produced by injecting purified type X collagen into female SJL/J mice and then fusing their spleen cells with Sp2/0 myeloma cells. Hybridoma culture supernatants were screened for antibodies to type X collagen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blots. Positive supernatants did not cross-react with other collagen types (I, II, IX, XI) or with fibronectin. Three monoclonal antibodies were chosen for further characterization. Two of them (1A6 and 6F6) recognize a pepsin-sensitive domain of type X collagen. Rotary shadowing showed that 1A6 and 6F6 both recognize the same end of type X, probably the aminoterminal non-triple helical domain. Amino acid sequencing of the intact protein and of the epitope-containing peptide confirmed that the antibody recognition sites for 1A6 and 6F6 are within the amino-terminal domain. Monoclonal antibody 2B3 reacts with the pepsinized (45 kDa) and weakly with the nonpepsinized (59 kDa) forms of type X collagen. The monoclonal antibodies were used for immunolocalization of type X in hypertrophic chondrocytes and reacted only with tissue samples from areas undergoing endochondral ossification, e.g. growth plate and fracture callus. Antibody 6F6, when coupled to Sepharose, selectively binds to type X collagen from cell and organ cultures. In a pulse-chase experiment, no processing of the 59-kDa form of type X could be detected. Two components with molecular masses of approximately 70 and 85 kDa, arising from a disulfide-bonded aggregate, were synthesized by both the permanent and calcifying cartilage organ cultures but did not react with the antibody, suggesting that these proteins are not related to type X. In summary, the pulse-chase results and the immune precipitation with monoclonal antibody 6F6 did not detect biosynthetic precursors larger than 59 kDa or proteolytically processed forms of type X."
https://openalex.org/W1519117577,The SP6 polymerase/promoter system was used to synthesize porcine pro-opiomelanocortin mRNAs with nucleotide sequence deletions in the 5'- as well as 3'-untranslated and coding regions. The translational efficiency of the mutant mRNAs was evaluated by cell-free translation or by monitoring the rate and extent of ribosome binding in the presence of sparsomycin. The results of these experiments indicate that specific nucleotide sequences in the 5'-untranslated and coding regions of the pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA decrease its rate of translation. Structure mapping of the mRNA with double-strand and single-strand specific nucleases suggests that these sequences can form stable secondary structures.
https://openalex.org/W1501434368,"Molecular interactions between purified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, whole thymus histones, histone H1, rat fibroblast genomic DNA, and closed circular and linearized SV40 DNA were determined by the nitrocellulose filter binding technique. Binding of the polymerase protein or histones to DNA was augmented greatly when both the enzyme protein and histones were present simultaneously. The polymerase protein also associated with histones in the absence of DNA. The cooperative or promoted binding of histones and the enzyme to relaxed covalently closed circular SV40 DNA was greater than the binding to the linearized form. Binding of the polymerase to SV40 DNA fragments in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl indicated a preferential binding to two restriction fragments as compared to the others. Polymerase binding to covalently closed relaxed SV40 DNA resulted in the induction of superhelicity. The simultaneous influence of the polymerase and histones on DNA topology were more than additive. Topological constraints on DNA induced by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were abolished by auto ADP-ribosylation of the enzyme. Benzamide, by inhibiting poly(ADP-ribosylation), reestablished the effect of the polymerase protein on DNA topology. Polymerase binding to in vitro-assembled core particle-like nucleosomes was also demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1489098022,"Mouse thymidylate synthase minigenes that lack introns were constructed by ligating restriction fragments containing 4.5, 1.0, or 0.25 kilobase pairs (kb) of 5'-flanking DNA of the normal thymidylate synthase gene and as little as 0.25 kb of 3'-flanking DNA to full-length thymidylate synthase cDNA. All three minigenes were expressed at approximately the same levels following transfection into hamster V79 cells that were deficient in thymidylate synthase. S1 nuclease protection assays revealed that the multiple 5' and 3' termini of thymidylate synthase mRNA in cells transfected with these minigenes were at the same positions as those of the normal mRNA in mouse cells. Deletion analysis of the promoter region revealed that minigenes extending to position -150 nucleotides (relative to the AUG codon) were expressed at approximately the same level as those extending to -1 kb. However, minigenes extending to -53 nucleotides were inactive. To determine if the minigenes were capable of being regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, thymidylate synthase gene expression was measured in hamster cells that were stably transfected with the largest minigene and synchronized by serum-stimulation. Thymidylate synthase enzyme level and mRNA content increased 3-5-fold as cells progressed from G1 through S phase."
https://openalex.org/W1545946086,"The reaction of human beta-endorphin and biotinyl N-hydroxysuccinimide with or without spacer arm, afforded a series of products that were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry of the biotinylated products and their tryptic digests produced abundant protonated molecular ions (MH+), which specified the number and location of biotinylation. Between 1 and 4 biotinyl residues were incorporated per human beta-endorphin molecule, at Lys-9, -19, -24, -28, and -29, but not at the amino-terminal Tyr-1. Three HPLC fractions were isolated for receptor binding studies with monobiotinylation of Lys-9 (B1 beta and B1X beta; X = C6 spacer arm), Lys-19 (B1 gamma), and a mixture of Lys-24, Lys-28, and Lys-29 derivatives (B1 alpha, BX1 alpha). All derivatives displayed tight binding to avidin, and no dissociation from avidin was detectable over several hours at 0 degrees C for the derivatives (BX1 alpha) tested. IC50 values for binding to mu and delta opioid receptor sites were 3-8 times higher for monobiotinylated derivatives than for the parent human beta-endorphin (IC50,mu = 1.5 nM, IC50,delta = 1.3 nM). Association with avidin decreased opioid receptor affinities for the C6 spacer derivative biotinylated at position Lys-9, which is close to the (1-5) enkephalin receptor region. In contrast, avidin did not affect or even increased apparent affinities to mu and delta sites for derivatives biotinylated at the alpha-helical part of the molecule (Lys-19, -24, -28, and -29). Thus, when bound to avidin, the biotinylated human beta-endorphin derivatives with spacer arm (BX1 alpha), substituted near the carboxyl terminal (Lys-24, -28, and -29), displayed mu binding affinities equal to and delta binding affinities only four times lower than underivatized human beta-endorphin. Biotinylated human beta-endorphins also bound to low affinity nonopioid binding sites on NG-108-15 cells; however, affinities to these sites were considerably reduced when derivatives were bound to avidin. The ability of biotinylated human beta-endorphin to cross-link the mu and delta opioid receptors to avidin allows application of the biotin-avidin system as a molecular probe of the opioid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1564081566,"The reduction of the following exogenous quinones by succinate and NADH was studied in mitochondria isolated from both wild type and ubiquinone (Q)-deficient strains of yeast: ubiquinone-0 (Q0), ubiquinone-1 (Q1), ubiquinone-2 (Q2), and its decyl analogue 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DB), duroquinone (DQ), menadione (MQ), vitamin K1 (2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), the plastoquinone analogue 2,3,6-trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (PQOc1), plastoquinone-2 (PQ2), and its decyl analogue (2,3-dimethyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone). Reduction of the small quinones DQ, Q0, Q1, and PQOc1 by NADH occurred in both wild type and Q-deficient mitochondria in a reaction inhibited more than 50% by myxothiazol and less than 20% by antimycin. The reduction of these small quinones by succinate also occurred in wild type mitochondria in a reaction inhibited more than 50% by antimycin but did not occur in Q-deficient mitochondria suggesting that endogenous Q6 is involved in their reduction. In addition, the inhibitory effects of antimycin and myxothiazol, specific inhibitors of the cytochrome b-c1 complex, on the reduction of these small quinones suggest the involvement of this complex in the electron transfer reaction. By contrast, the reduction of Q2 and DB by succinate was insensitive to inhibitors and by NADH was 20-30% inhibited by myxothiazol suggesting that these analogues are directly reduced by the primary dehydrogenases. The dependence of the sensitivity to the inhibitors on the substrate used suggests that succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase interacts specifically with center i (the antimycin-sensitive site) and NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase preferentially with center o (the myxothiazol-sensitive site) of the cytochrome b-c1 complex. The NADH dehydrogenase involved in the myxothiazol-sensitive quinone reduction faces the matrix side of the inner membrane suggesting that center o may be localized within the membrane at a similar depth as center i."
https://openalex.org/W1578764295,"Two different phosphofructokinase-phosphorylating protein kinases were separated from extracts of Ascaris suum muscle by chromatography on DEAE-Fractogel. They were tentatively designated phosphofructokinase kinase I and phosphofructokinase kinase II. Phosphofructokinase kinase I eluted from the chromatography column at an ionic strength of 0.07 and contained about 25% of the phosphofructokinase-phosphorylating activity assayed in crude extracts. The protein kinase activity was not stimulated by the addition of either cAMP or cGMP. It was inhibited by the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitory protein from rabbit muscle (Walsh inhibitor), by the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase from beef heart, and by the cAMP-binding protein from Ascaris muscle. These properties suggest that phosphofructokinase kinase I is homologous to the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinases from mammals. This assumption is supported by the estimation of the Mr of 40,000 for the purified phosphofructokinase kinase I under denaturing conditions and by the fact that the presence of cAMP eliminated the inhibition by the cAMP binding proteins. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was 8.7. Phosphofructokinase kinase II was eluted from the DEAE-Fractogel column at an ionic strength of 0.16 and contained approximately 75% of the phosphofructokinase kinase activity measured in the extracts. The molecular and kinetic properties were significantly different from those of phosphofructokinase kinase I. The enzyme was not inhibited by the heat-stable inhibitor protein nor by cAMP-binding proteins. The Mr of the native enzyme was estimated as 220,000 by molecular sieve chromatography. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was pH 5.45."

Subfragments of P1 DNA EcoRI fragment 7 were cloned into expression vectors, and the c1 repressor protein from P1 wild-type phage and a revertant of a temperature-sensitive repressor mutant were overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to near-homogeneity. The decreased electrophoretic mobility of P1 DNA BamHI fragment 9 in the presence of appropriate protein fractions was used as an assay for the repressor protein. Highly purified repressor migrates as a single polypeptide on denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, corresponding to a molecular weight of about 33,000. A molecular weight of about 63,000 for the native repressor molecule was calculated from determinations of the sedimentation coefficient, which was 2.6 s, and the Stokes radius, which was 55 A. Cross-linking the protein with glutaraldehyde yielded two bands. These data and a high frictional coefficient (2.1) suggest that the native repressor exists in solution as an asymmetric dimer molecule."

A., Shaeffer, R., Galvez, L., and Malave, S. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 80, 6102-6104, 1983; Halperin, J. A., Martin, A. M., and Malave, S. (1985) Life Sci. 37, 561-566. We describe here some properties of the CSF inhibitor of the Na+/K+ pump. Active material was extracted from human CSF with 50% methanol and then concentrated and desalted by ultrafiltration. This extract inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the ouabain-sensitive influx of K+ into human red cells and the activity of purified Na+/K+-ATPase. Partial separation of the inhibitory activity was achieved by gel filtration and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Inhibition of both pump and enzyme was specific in that other red cell membrane transport systems or enzymes examined were not influenced by CSF extracts. Dialysis and ultrafiltration experiments indicate that the molecular weight of the inhibitor is approximately equal to 600. The inhibitory activity is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes indicating that the inhibitor might be a small peptide. In the presence of CSF extract the K0.5 for external K+ to stimulate the Na+/K+ pump increased from 1.4 to 3.1 mM, suggesting that the CSF inhibitor competes with external K+ for stimulation of the pump. We estimate that the concentration of the inhibitor in CSF might be approximately equal to 50 pg/ml, a value close to the concentration of other active peptides found in human CSF."
https://openalex.org/W1529978975,"Abstract The introduction of a single nick in DNA circles by Crithidia fasciculata nicking enzyme (Shlomai, J., and Linial, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16219-16225) requires the presence of a bent structure in the DNA helix. However, the sequence directing the local bending of the DNA helix is not per se a preferred site for nicking by the enzyme. No extensive sequence specificity is involved in defining the cleavage site for C. fasciculata nicking enzyme in the duplex circular DNA substrate. However, the abundance of A and T residues is significantly high at both the 3' and the 5' termini generated at the nicked site. Nicking of the sequence-directed bent fragment from C. fasciculata kinetoplast DNA minicircles correlates with the periodicity determined by the unique nucleotide distribution in the bent sequence, reflected in its thermodynamic parameters. Occurrence of nicking is best correlated with the predicted minima of the melting temperature and delta G profiles, as well as with A and T dinucleotide sequences at the nicked site, in both the supercoiled and the relaxed sequence-directed bent DNA substrates. The potential role of the bend-dependent nicking reaction in the replication of kinetoplast DNA minicircles is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1560626950,"Sendai and influenza virions are able to fuse with mycoplasmata. Virus-Mycoplasma fusion was demonstrated by the use of fluorescently labeled intact virions and fluorescence dequenching, as well as by electron microscopy. A high degree of fusion was observed upon incubation of both virions with Mycoplasma gallisepticum or Mycoplasma capricolum. Significantly less virus-cell fusion was observed with Acholeplasma laidlawii, whose membrane contains relatively low amounts of cholesterol. The requirement of cholesterol for allowing virus-Mycoplasma fusion was also demonstrated by showing that a low degree of fusion was obtained with M. capricolum, whose cholesterol content was decreased by modifying its growth medium. Fluorescence dequenching was not observed by incubating unfusogenic virions with mycoplasmata. Sendai virions were rendered nonfusogenic by treatment with trypsin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, or dithiothreitol, whereas influenza virions were made nonfusogenic by treatment with glutaraldehyde, ammonium hydroxide, high temperatures, or incubation at low pH. Practically no fusion was observed using influenza virions bearing uncleaved hemagglutinin. Trypsinization of influenza virions bearing uncleaved hemagglutinin greatly stimulated their ability to fuse with Mycoplasma cells. Similarly to intact virus particles, also reconstituted virus envelopes, bearing the two viral glycoproteins, fused with M. capricolum. However, membrane vesicles, bearing only the viral binding (HN) or fusion (F) glycoproteins, failed to fuse with mycoplasmata. Fusion between animal enveloped virions and prokaryotic cells was thus demonstrated."

The relationship of the number of receptors which are modified as a function of the receptors which bind cAMP was investigated. Modification was assessed by determining the amounts of R and D forms in Western blots which detect all receptors whether or not they are exposed on the surface. Cyclic AMP or the analog, adenosine 3',5'-monophosphorothioate ((Rp)-cAMPS), induced a loss of cAMP-binding activity (down-regulation), which was not accompanied by a loss of the receptor protein. About 60% of the receptors do not bind cAMP in the absence of Ca2+ and are unmasked by 10 mM Ca2+. However, the fraction of receptors which are modified in response to cAMP is equal in the absence or presence of Ca2+. (Rp)-cAMPs induces down-regulation (50%) but not modification. Addition of cAMP, following down-regulation by (Rp)-cAMPS, causes all receptors to be modified. cAMP induces both down-regulation (80%) and modification. Modification is more readily reversed than down-regulation: 30 min after removal of cAMP, receptors remain down-regulated (57%) but are found in the R form. All receptors shift to the D form when cAMP is readded to the cells. These results indicate that exposed, as well as cryptic and down-regulated receptors, are modified in response to the cAMP stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1591713964,"The cation-transporting activity and Na,K-ATPase activity of CV-1 cell recipients of the mouse ouabain resistance gene (ouaR6, or OR6 cells; see Levenson, R., Racaniello, V., Albritton, L., and Housman, D. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 1489-1493) have been further characterized. OR6 cells grown in strophanthidin (a cardiac aglycon which may be removed rapidly from the Na,K-ATPase) possess both ouabain-sensitive and -insensitive 86Rb+ uptake activities. The ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake activity of these cells (OR6-S cells) exhibits the same Ki for ouabain as that of the CV-1 parent cells (Ki(app) = 3 x 10(-7) M ouabain), but accounts for only approximately 30% of total 86Rb+ uptake into Na+-loaded OR6-S cells, compared to 80% for CV-1 cells. Most of the ouabain-resistant 86Rb+ uptake in OR6-S cells is dependent on internal Na+ and is insensitive to furosemide, suggesting that it is due to an ouabain-resistant Na,K pump. In OR6-S cell lysates, 50% of Na+-dependent ATPase activity is insensitive to 1 mM ouabain, compared to less than 5% in CV-1 cell lysates. In addition, purified plasma membranes from OR6-S cells contain a 100-kDa protein which is transiently phosphorylated by ATP in an Na+-dependent, K+-sensitive manner, like the alpha subunit of the CV-1 Na,K-ATPase and the canine renal Na,K-ATPase, but which is unaffected by preincubation in 1 mM ouabain. All of these data suggest that OR6-S cells possess a ouabain-insensitive Na,K pump with characteristics similar to the ouabain-sensitive pump of CV-1 parent cells. Since the mouse ouabain resistance gene does not encode either subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, these results suggest that the ouabain resistance gene product may modify the ouabain sensitivity of the endogenous CV-1 Na,K pump."
https://openalex.org/W1548004076,"A murine monoclonal antibody (mAb A23-16) was produced that recognizes a glycoprotein antigen preferentially expressed on the surface of human small cell lung carcinoma cells. This antibody is of IgG 1 isotype, has an association constant of 5 x 10(7) M-1, and reacts preferentially with human small cell lung carcinoma cell lines and fresh frozen sections in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoperoxidase assays, respectively. The antigen recognized by A23-16 is a sulfated glycoprotein with phosphorylated threonine residues. The mature 90-kDa molecule has intrachain disulfide bonds and appears to be derived from a 76-kDa precursor, that is neither sulfated nor phosphorylated, but contains N-linked oligosaccharides. Conversion of the 76-kDa precursor to the mature form is accompanied by processing of these oligosaccharides from the high mannose to the complex type, although the increase in molecular mass from 76 to 90 kDa cannot be accounted for by this modification alone. MAb A23-16 reacts with its target antigen independent of the N-linked oligosaccharides, but requires intact intrachain disulfide bond(s) for reactivity. These studies on the molecular characterization of a monoclonal antibody-defined glycoprotein, preferentially expressed by small cell lung cancer, provide a basis for further structural and functional studies that may eventually lead to a delineation of its biological relevance for neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1518415272,"Seryl-tRNA synthetase has been purified from the middle silk glands of Bombyx mori by successive chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, hydroxylapatite, and Bio-Rex 70. The high abundance of seryl-tRNA synthetase in the middle silk glands may result from an adaptation of this organ for the production of the serine-rich protein, sericin. The enzyme is a dimer of Mr = 124,000 consisting of similar or identical subunits and has an oligomeric structure similar to its procaryotic and eucaryotic counterparts. Seryl-tRNA synthetase can be cleaved with trypsin to generate a fragment of Mr = 45,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels; the presence of tRNASer protects the enzyme from tryptic cleavage. Conversion to the Mr = 45,000 species is accompanied by a 90% loss in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity, but only a 20% loss in ATP PPi exchange activity."
