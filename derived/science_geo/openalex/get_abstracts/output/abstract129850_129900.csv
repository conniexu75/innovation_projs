https://openalex.org/W1978279440,"Caveolin, a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal component of caveolae membranes. We and others have suggested that caveolin functions as a scaffolding protein to organize and concentrate certain caveolin-interacting signaling molecules within caveolae membranes. In this regard, it has been shown that a 20-amino acid membrane-proximal region of the cytosolic NH2-terminal domain of caveolin is sufficient to mediate the interaction of caveolin with signaling proteins, namely G-proteins, Src-like kinases, eNOS, and H-Ras. This caveolin-derived protein domain has been termed the caveolin-scaffolding domain. Binding of the caveolin-scaffolding domain functionally suppresses the activity of G-protein α subunits, eNOS, and Src-like kinases, suggesting that caveolin binding may also play a negative regulatory role in signal transduction.Here, we report the direct interaction of caveolin with a growth factor receptor, EGF-R, a known caveolae-associated receptor tyrosine kinase. Two consensus caveolin binding motifs have been previously defined using phage display technology. One of these motifs is present within the conserved kinase domains of most known receptor tyrosine kinases (termed region IX). We now show that this caveolin binding motif within the kinase domain of the EGF-R can mediate the interaction of the EGF-R with the scaffolding domains of caveolins 1 and 3 but not with caveolin 2. In addition, the scaffolding domains of caveolins 1 and 3 both functionally inhibit the autophosphorylation of the EGF-R kinasein vitro. Importantly, this caveolin-mediated inhibition of the EGF-R kinase could be prevented by the addition of an EGF-R-derived peptide that (i) contains a well conserved caveolin binding motif and (ii) is located within the kinase domain of the EGF-R and most known receptor tyrosine kinases. Similar results were obtained with protein kinase C, a serine/threonine kinase, suggesting that caveolin may function as a general kinase inhibitor. The implications of our results are discussed within the context of caveolae-mediated signal transduction. In this regard, caveolae-coupled signaling might explain how linear signaling pathways can branch and interconnect extensively, forming a signaling module or network.

In this regard, caveolae-coupled signaling might explain how linear signaling pathways can branch and interconnect extensively, forming a signaling module or network. Caveolae are vesicular organelles that represent a subdivision of the plasma membrane. They are most abundant in terminally differentiated cell types, i.e. adipocytes, endothelial cells, and muscle cells (skeletal, cardiac, and smooth), although they are found in most cells (1Couet J.

It has been suggested that caveolae may function as subcellular compartments to (i) store inactive signaling molecules for regulated activation and (ii) to facilitate cross-talk between distinct signaling cascades (1Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Sherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Lisanti M.P. Scherer P. Tang Z.-L. Sargiacomo M.

Caveolin, a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a major structural component of caveolae. Several independent lines of evidence indicate that caveolin may function as a scaffolding protein within caveolae membranes. (i) Both the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of caveolin face the cytoplasm, allowing them to freely interact with cytosolic molecules (5Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 6Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). (ii) Caveolin undergoes two stages of oligomerization. First, caveolin monomers assemble into discrete multivalent oligomers containing ∼14–16 monomers per oligomer (8Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P.

Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Subsequently, these individual caveolin homo-oligomers (4–6-nm particles) can interact with each other to form caveolae-like structures in vitro (25–50-nm clusters) (8Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). (iii) Interaction of caveolin with purified heterotrimeric G-proteins and c-Src functionally suppresses their enzymatic activity, holding these proteins in an inactive conformation (10Li S.

Thus, caveolin may organize the formation of caveolae microdomains and regulate caveolae-related signaling events. Using a variety of domain mapping approaches (deletion mutagenesis, GST fusion proteins, synthetic peptides), a region within caveolin has been defined that mediates the interaction of caveolin with itself and other proteins. This cytoplasmic 41-amino acid membrane-proximal region of caveolin is sufficient to mediate the formation of caveolin homo-oligomers (8Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl-terminal half of this region (20 amino acids, residues 82–101) mediates the interaction of caveolin with G-protein α subunits and Src-family tyrosine kinases (10Li S.

Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). This caveolin region preferentially recognizes the inactive conformation of these molecules, as mutationally activated Gα subunits (Gs, Q227L), v-Src, and H-Ras (G12V) fail to interact with caveolin (10Li S.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). As this caveolin domain (residues 82–101) is critical for caveolin homo-oligomerization and the interaction of caveolin with certain caveolae-associated proteins (G-proteins, H-Ras, eNOS, and Src-family kinases), we have previously termed this protein domain the caveolin scaffolding domain (11Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 13Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25437-25440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). What is the molecular basis of these interactions? Perhaps the caveolin scaffolding domain recognizes a common sequence motif within caveolin binding signaling molecules. To investigate this possibility, we have used the caveolin scaffolding domain as a receptor to select caveolin binding peptide ligands from random peptide sequences displayed at the surface of bacteriophage (phage display libraries). Two related caveolin binding motifs (ΦXΦXXXXΦ and ΦXXXXΦXXΦ, Φ being aromatic amino acids Trp, Phe, or Tyr) were elucidated, and these motifs exist within most caveolae-associated proteins (15Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolin binding motifs (ligand) mediate the interaction of caveolin-binding proteins with the scaffolding domain of caveolin (receptor). Caveolin binding motifs are present within most Gαsubunits and within the kinase domains of many distinct classes of protein kinases: serine-threonine kinases (PKCα), 1The abbreviations used are:PKCα, protein kinase C; -R, -receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Ins, insulin; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; wt, wild type; -Rp, receptor peptides; I-Rp, insulin receptor peptide; KD, kinase domain; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CR, cytoplasmic region. 1The abbreviations used are:PKCα, protein kinase C; -R, -receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Ins, insulin; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; wt, wild type; -Rp, receptor peptides; I-Rp, insulin receptor peptide; KD, kinase domain; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CR, cytoplasmic region. dual specificity kinases (mitogen-activated protein kinase), nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (Src-family kinases), and receptor tyrosine kinases (EGF-R, Ins-R, PDGF-R). With the exception of Src-family kinases, however, it remains unknown whether caveolin interacts directly with these kinases or can functionally regulate their activity. Here, we present evidence that the EGF-R kinase interacts directly with the caveolin scaffolding domain via a conserved caveolin binding motif (ΦXΦXXXXΦ; W S Y GVTV W ) that is localized within the kinase domain of most receptor tyrosine kinases. We also show that caveolin binding can functionally regulate the kinase activity of EGF-R in vitro. Thus, EGF-R is the first signaling receptor to be shown to interact directly with caveolin. In support of our current observations, many receptor tyrosine kinases as well as their signaling cascades have been previously localized to caveolae or caveolae-related domains, including EGF-R, PDGF-R, fibroblast growth factor receptor, Ins-R, and nerve growth factor receptor (trk) (16Liu P.

Antibodies and their sources were as follows: anti-caveolin 1 mouse IgG (mAb 2297) and anti-caveolin 1 rabbit polyclonal IgG (gifts of Dr. John R. Glenney, Transduction Laboratories); anti-EGF-R, anti-activated-EGF-R (recognizes only the autophosphorylated form of the receptor after EGF stimulation), anti-erbB2, anti-gelsolin, and anti-β-adaptin mouse monoclonal IgGs (Transduction Laboratories). A variety of other reagents were purchased commercially: purified recombinant EGF-R kinase (containing residues 647–1186 of the human EGF-R; Stratagene); glutathione-agarose beads and reduced glutathione (Sigma); protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc). Peptide synthesis was performed by the biopolymers facility at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). The catalytic subunit of protein kinase C (PKC-M, rat brain) and its substrate (histone H1, calf thymus) were purchased from Calbiochem. A431 cells and CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were serum-starved for more than 6 h before performing experiments. Cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, and EGF treatment (50 ng/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) was performed for 5 min. Caveolin-enriched membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (12Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). EGF-treated A431 cells (three 150-mm dishes) were washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0. The cell suspension was homogenized using a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes), sheared in a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts, Kinematica GmbH, Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY), and subjected to sonication using an ultrasonicator (three 20-s bursts; Branson Sonifier 250, Branson Ultrasonic Corp., Danbury, CT). The homogenate was then adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 90% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 0.15 mNaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–35% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (4 ml of 5% sucrose, 4 ml of 35% sucrose, both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Twelve-to-thirteen 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 15% acrylamide). After transfer to nitrocellulose, Western blot analysis was performed with various antibody probes. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000 dilution; Amersham Life Science, Inc.) were used to visualize bound primary antibodies by an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL) (Amersham). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). A near confluent 150-mm dish of A431 cells was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% CHAPS, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 15 min and pre-cleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose for 6 h at 4 °C. After pre-clearing, supernatants were transferred to 1.5-ml microfuge tubes containing anti-caveolin or anti-EGF-R IgGs pre-bound to protein G-Sepharose. After incubation rotating overnight at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed 3 × with lysis buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis with an anti-EGF-R mAb probe. One ml of a pre-cleared A431 cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with streptavidin-agarose alone or with streptavidin-agarose containing a pre-bound biotinylated caveolin 1 peptide (residues 61–101). The beads were washed (6–8 times) with lysis buffer, and bound material was eluted with sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, immunoblot analysis was performed with an anti-EGF-R mAb probe (1:1,000 dilution). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgGs (1:5,000 dilution, Amersham) were used to visualized bound primary antibodies by ECL (Amersham). The construction, expression, and purification of GST fusion proteins was as we described previously (7Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Briefly, portions of the cytoplasmic tail of the EGF-R were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers containing engineered restriction sites and subcloned into the vector pGEX-4T-1. After expression inEscherichia coli (BL21 strain; Novagen, Inc.), GST-EGF-R fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads (21Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. After transfer, nitrocellulose sheets were stained with Ponceau S to visualize protein bands and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-GST IgG (1:1,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). We used 96-well plates (Nunc Maxisorp) to perform all ELISAs. The ELISA were carried out essentially as described previously (15Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 pmol of peptide in 100 mmsodium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, was used per well for coating the plate for 16–20 h at 4 °C or for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were saturated for 1 h at room temperature with TBST (10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Purified GST-EGF-R fusion proteins (200 ng/well) (22Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 568-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) or biotinylated peptides (100 pmol) in TBST were then added to the wells. After 2 h of incubation, the cells were washed (3–5 times) with TBST. Binding of GST fusion proteins was detected using an anti-GST mAb probe (diluted 1:1,000) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (diluted 1:2,000). Binding of biotinylated peptides was observed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (diluted 1:2,000). The color reaction was initiated by the addition of ABTS (2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate)) (Boehringer Mannheim). Optical density was measured on a microplate reader at 410 nm. To the caveolin 1 (82–101) peptide-coated well, a mixture of the GST fusion protein (∼3 pmol) and increasing amounts of competing peptide were added. The mixture was assembled just before addition to the well. The procedure that followed was as described above. We also used biotinylated peptides in several experiments, and binding was revealed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (diluted 1:2,000). ∼100 ng of purified recombinant EGF-R kinase (Stratagene) was incubated with caveolin peptides at concentrations of 0, 1, 3, and 10 μmin kinase reaction buffer. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 40 mm MnCl2, 200 μmNa3VO4). When caveolin or EGF-R peptides were included in the reaction, the mixture was pre-incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol). After incubation for 15 min at 25 °C, the reaction was halted by the addition of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 2 min. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Control samples omitting either [γ-32P]ATP or EGF-R showed no activity. Lysates from untransfected CHO cells, CHO-EGF-R wild type (wt), and CHO kinase dead EGF-R cells were prepared as described above for A431 cells in the following buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% CHAPS, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors). For EGF-treated samples, EGF (100 ng/ml) was present at all steps during the experiment. GST and GST-caveolin 1 (residues 61–101) were prebound to agarose beads and prewashed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysis buffer extensively. These beads contained ∼100 pmol/100 μl of packed volume. Approximately 50 μl of this material was incubated with 1.5 ml of lysate. After binding, the beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer and eluted with elution buffer (lysis buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione). The eluate was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using antibodies directed against EGF-R. PKC kinase activity was measured using histone H1 as the substrate, as suggested by the manufacturer (Calbiochem). Briefly, kinase reactions were performed using 4 ng of PKC-M and 3 pmol of histone H1 in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2). After 1 h preincubation with a given peptide at 4 °C, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol). After 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 2 min. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Control samples omitting either [γ-32P]ATP or PKC showed no activity. A431 cells are known to express both EGF-R (23Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J. Dull T. Gray A. Tam A. Lee J. Yarden Y. Liberman T. Schlessinger J. Downard J. Mayes E. Whittle N. Waterfield M. Seeburg P. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar) and caveolin 1 (5Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 24Raposo G. Dunia I. Delavier-Klutchko C. Kaveri S. Stroberg A.D. Benedeth E.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 340-352PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we used this cell line to examine the potential association of EGF-R with caveolin. A carbonate-based fractionation scheme was employed for the purification of caveolin-enriched membranes. Fig. 1shows that EGF-R co-fractionates with caveolin 1 in A431 cells (Fig. 1,upper panel). Interestingly, erbB2 (also known as neu), a close relative to the EGF-R, also co-fractionates with caveolin 1. In contrast, β-adaptin, gelsolin, and greater than 99% total cellular proteins were excluded from these caveolin-rich membrane fractions (Fig. 1, lower panel). β-Adaptin has been implicated in the formation of plasma membrane-derived clathrin-coated vesicles, whereas gelsolin is a cytosolic actin binding protein. Caveolin 1 has been shown to interact directly with a variety of cytoplasmic signal transducing molecules (i.e.Gα subunits, H-Ras, eNOS and c-Src) through a common membrane-proximal region of its NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain. This 20-amino acid region (residues 82–101) has recently been termed the caveolin scaffolding domain. However, it is not known whether caveolin interacts directly with signaling receptors, such as EGF-R. To evaluate the potential interaction of EGF-R with caveolin 1, we used two independent approaches: (i) coimmunoprecipitation and (ii) peptides encoding the caveolin 1 scaffolding domain coupled to agarose. Fig.2 A shows that EGF-R coimmunoprecipitates with caveolin 1 when either a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody directed against caveolin 1 is employed. However, EGF-R failed to coimmunoprecipitate when antibodies directed against caveolin-3 were utilized. As caveolin-3 is only expressed in muscle tissue types and is not expressed in A431 cells, this serves as an appropriate negative control for nonspecific coimmunoprecipitation. To assess the role of the caveolin 1 scaffolding domain in this interaction, we next incubated A431 cell lysates with the caveolin 1 scaffolding domain coupled to agarose beads. Fig. 2 B shows that this caveolin 1 peptide retained the EGF-R, whereas agarose beads alone showed no binding of EGF-R. These studies directly implicate the caveolin 1 scaffolding domain in this interaction. Using the caveolin 1 scaffolding domain as a receptor to select random peptide ligands, two similar caveolin binding motifs were recently deduced (ΦXΦXXXXΦ and ΦXXXXΦXXΦ, where Φ is an aromatic residue Trp, Phe, or Tyr) (15Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). These two motifs are present in a composite manner (ΦXΦXXXXΦXXΦ) in most G-protein α subunits, a known class of caveolin-interacting proteins (15Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J.

Thus, we searched the cytoplasmic tail of the EGF-R and other receptor tyrosine kinases for a caveolin binding motif. Fig.3 A shows that a single caveolin binding motif (ΦXΦXXXXΦ) was identified within the kinase domain of EGF-R (DV W S Y GVTV W ELMTF), and this motif is conserved within the kinase domains of most known receptor tyrosine kinases (Ins-R, PDGF-R, erbB2, fibroblast growth factor receptor, nerve growth factor receptor (trk), IGF-R, and others). Also note that this EGF-R sequence is identical to the corresponding sequence within erbB2, a close relative of the EGF-R. To determine whether this short EGF-R sequence can serve as a ligand for the caveolin scaffolding domain, we created three GST-EGF-R fusion proteins covering different regions of the cytoplasmic region of EGF-R (Fig. 3 B, N-CR, KD, andC-CR). In addition, we also designed a peptide encoding this EGF-R-derived caveolin binding motif (termed EGF-Rp, representing residues 894–907 of EGF-R). Note that this predicted caveolin binding stretch (residues 894–907) is included within KD (712–979) and C-CR (889–1210) fusion proteins but is excluded from the N-CR (669–888) fusion protein. Using an established ELISA that we previously used to map the caveolin binding region of G-protein α subunits (15Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), we evaluated the ability of these three GST-EGF-R fusion proteins to interact with the caveolin 1 scaffolding domain. For this purpose, we used three different caveolin peptides encoding the scaffolding domains of caveolin 1 or caveolin 2 or an irrelevant caveolin 1 peptide (residues 53–81). As illustrated in Fig. 4, the KDand C-CR fusion proteins selectively interacted with the caveolin 1 scaffolding domain but not with the caveolin 2 scaffolding domain or with the irrelevant caveolin 1 peptide. In addition, theN-CR fusion did not show an interaction with any of these peptides. Taken together, these results indicate the caveolin binding region of EGF-R lies between EGF-R residues 889 and 979 (by comparison of the binding of N-CR and KD fusions). These mapping studies are as predicted based on the presence of a caveolin binding motif between EGF-R residues 894–907. To evaluate if this EGF-R region was indeed implicated in caveolin binding, we examined the binding of a biotinylated version of the EGF-Rp peptide to the caveolin 1 scaffolding domain. Fig.5 A shows that the EGF-Rp peptide interacted with the caveolin 1 sc"

We have addressed the novel possibility that the level of intracellular K+ regulates the apoptotic process by controlling the activity of death enzymes. We show that K+, at normal intracellular levels, inhibits both apoptotic DNA fragmentation and caspase-3(CPP32)-like protease activation, suggesting that intracellular K+ loss must occur early during apoptosis. Direct measurement of K+ by inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry and flow cytometry indicates a major decrease in intracellular K+ concentration in the apoptotic cell. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that caspase and nuclease activity were restricted to the subpopulation of cells with reduced K+. Disruption of the natural K+electrochemical gradient suppressed the activity of both caspase and nuclease independent of the mode of activation of the apoptotic inducing agent, demonstrating that a decrease in intracellular K+ concentration is a necessary, early event in programmed cell death.

Apoptosis is a physiological form of cell death that occurs in response to a variety of signals. Although diverse agents induce apoptosis via unique signal transduction pathways, the process is remarkably similar in all systems. Morphologically, the cells in early stages of apoptosis shrink, and chromatin condenses. The nucleus then fragments, and the entire cell blebs into apoptotic bodies that maintain membrane integrity, ensuring encapsulation of the intracellular components. Genetic evidence has shown the requirement of specific gene products for the effective elimination of cells (1Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R.

Little is currently known about the mechanisms that provide this chronic suppressive effect on the apoptotic machinery. In response to an apoptotic stimuli, there is a relief of the suppressive influences within a cell that manifests biochemical alterations including the activation of proteases and nucleases. Much attention has focused recently on the role of proteases related to interleukin-1β converting enzyme (recently renamed caspases (10Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G.

Caspases are synthesized and maintained in the cytoplasm as proenzymes which themselves must undergo a proteolytic activation, perhaps triggering apoptosis. The substrates cleaved by these enzymes are numerous (17Kumar S. Lavin M.F. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 255-268PubMed Google Scholar) and include both structural proteins (18Kayalar C. Ord T.

The active apoptotic nuclease(s) cleaves chromatin to produce nucleosomal (180–200 base pairs) or oligonucleosomal (multiples thereof) DNA fragments (32Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar, 33Skalka M. Matyásová J. Cejková M. FEBS Lett. 1976; 72: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When analyzed by electrophoresis these fragments produce the widely recognized “apoptotic ladder.” Destruction of the structural proteins and the genome clearly represents a commitment step to the apoptotic process beyond which death is inevitable. One of the most striking morphological changes common to all apoptotic cells is the loss of volume (i.e. cell shrinkage). Alterations in cell volume are typically mediated by changes in the intracellular ion levels, and apoptotic changes appear to be no exception (5Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Benson R.S.P. Heer S. Dive C. Watson A.J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1190-C1203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Barbiero G.

However, nothing is known about the effects of these ionic changes on the activity of the underlying apoptotic machinery. Ions are well known to influence protein structure and can profoundly alter the activity of many different enzymes including proteases and nucleases (37Polgar L. Patthy A.

Since the majority of apoptotic enzyme activity takes place in a membrane-intact cell, one assumes that these enzymes should be functional in the presence of ion concentrations that approximate the intracellular environment. K+ is the predominant intracellular ion, and thus, we analyzed the effects of K+ on two key apoptotic enzymes, caspase-3-like protease and the internucleosomal DNA cleavage nuclease. The results demonstrate an in vitro inhibition of these enzymes by normal intracellular K+ concentrations and anin vivo association of K+ loss with their activation, implying the K+ efflux is necessary for the activation of apoptosis. Thymocytes were prepared as described previously (5Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A.

Briefly, bilaterally adrenalectomized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were killed by decapitation and thymocytes quickly released by gentle homogenization. Cells were then filtered, washed, resuspended in PBS, 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DEX, dexamethasone; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoro-methylcoumarin; PBFIAM, potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate-acetoxymethylester; CHAPS,3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; [K] i , intracellular concentration of K+. and counted on a hemacytometer. For normal cultures, cells were plated at 5 × 105/ml in normal medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY), 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 75 units/ml streptomycin sulfate and incubated at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere). To investigate the spontaneous digestion of thymocyte nuclei, plasma membranes were lysed in ice-cold 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2 at a concentration of 4 × 108 nuclei/ml. Nuclei (4 × 107) were then added to microcentrifuge tubes containing final concentrations of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and experimental treatments in a final volume of 400 μl. Samples were rotated at room temperature for 1.5 h. Following incubation, 200 μl were removed and EDTA, NaCl, and SDS added to 25 mm, 540 mm and 0.5%, respectively. TE buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA) was added to bring the final volume up to 400 μl and proteinase K added to 0.5 mg/ml, and the samples were incubated at 55 °C for 1 h prior to phenol/chloroform extraction and DNA precipitation. DNA was resuspended in 30 μl of TE buffer (10 μg of RNase A), and concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically after 16 h incubation (37 °C). DNA (15 μg) was electrophoresed (3.25 h, 80 V) through 1.8% agarose gels (20 mm Tris phosphate, 2 mm EDTA), stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed using UV transillumination. For quantitation, photographs were scanned (Silver Scanner III, La Cie Limited, Beaverton, OR) into a Macintosh computer, and densitometric plots were obtained using NIH Image software (NIH Bethesda, MD). The percent DNA degraded was calculated by dividing the low molecular weight area under the curve (<4.4 kilobase pairs) by the total area and multiplying by 100. The HeLa nuclei assay was performed as described previously (29Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 45Schwartzman R.A.

Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, to prepare nuclear extracts nuclei were resuspended in 300 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Extracts were ultracentrifuged (165,000 × g; 1 h; 4 °C) and stored at −70 °C. HeLa cells, grown in suspension culture, were counted, and nuclei were isolated as described above for thymocyte autodigestion. Nuclei were resuspended at 2 × 107 nuclei/ml in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and added (2 × 106 nuclei) to samples containing final concentrations of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and experimental treatments in a total volume of 400 μl. Following incubation for 5 h at room temperature with rotation, samples were processed for electrophoresis as described above for thymocyte autodigestion. In the absence of added extract, HeLa nuclei do not spontaneously degrade their DNA to any significant degree during the course of this incubation (29Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One μg of of linearized pUC18 plasmid was added to tubes containing 50 mm Tris, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 μg of thymocyte nuclear extract, and increasing concentrations of KCl. Samples were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of 20 μg of proteinase K, further incubation at 55 °C for 1 h, and electrophoresis for 1.5 h on a 1% agarose gel. DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Caspase-1-like and caspase-3-like protease activity was measured using a fluorometric assay (47Hasegawa J.-I. Kamada S. Kamiike W. Shimizu S. Imazu T. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1713-1718PubMed Google Scholar, 48Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2737-2742PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by resuspending thymocytes (108/ml) in 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.5) followed by Dounce homogenization. Alternatively, cells from culture were resuspended in 10 mmMgCl2, 0.25% Nonidet P-40. Debris was pelleted at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were placed on ice. In some experiments, extracts were next incubated for 1 h (30 °C) with 1 mm dATP and 10 μg/ml cytochromec. For caspase-3-like enzyme assays, 10–50 μg of extract (measured by the method of Bradford (49Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar)) was preincubated (10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS (pH 7.5) ± treatment) with 200 μm of the noncompetitive inhibitor Z-DEVD-aldehyde (DEVD-al) (BaChem Biosciences, King of Prussia, PA) (1 h; 30 °C). Parallel samples were prepared without inhibitor. Substrate (Z-DEVD-AFC) (Kamiya Biomedical Co., Thousand Oaks, CA) was then added to all tubes (200 μmfinal). Samples were incubated for (5 min; 30 °C), and their fluorescence at 505 nm was measured (excitation at 400 nm). Samples were incubated an additional hour and fluorescence again measured. A standard curve of fluorescence versus free AFC (Sigma) was the used to calculate the specific activity of caspase-3-like enzymes in each sample. Caspase-1-like activity was measured in an identical manner using Z-YVAD-AFC (Kamiya Biomedical Co., Thousand Oaks, CA) as substrate and Z-YVAD-aldehyde (BaChem Biosciences, King of Prussia, PA) as inhibitor. Cleavage of caspase-3 was followed by in vitrotranslating caspase-3 (gene kindly provided by Dr. Vishva M. Dixit, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor) in the presence of Tran35S-label (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. In vitro translated product was then added (2.5 μl/50 μl reaction volume) to the activation reactions described above. Following activation, samples were processed and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Following culture, cells were counted and sized on a Coulter Multisizer II (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Cells (2 × 107) were pelleted, washed in PBS, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and layered on top of a 0.5-ml oil (3:7, 1-bromodecane:1-bromododecane), 0.5-ml 15% trichloroacetic acid gradient and spun at ≈14,000 × g for 17 s. K+ in the trichloroacetic acid layer (intracellular K+) was measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometry (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle, NC). Similar measurements were also obtained by atomic absorption. Intracellular K+ was measured by flow cytometry using the dye PBFI-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (50Minta A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19449-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with PBFI-AM by addition of the dye to the media at a final concentration of 5 μm for 1 h prior to harvest. After harvest, cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10 μg/ml propidium iodide. Analysis was accomplished using a Becton Dickinson FACStar flow cytometer (excitation 340–350 nm; emission 425 nm). For DNA content, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, pelleted, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in PBS containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide. DNA content was then analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSort flow cytometer. For caspase measurements, cells were sorted into normal sized and shrunken populations on a Becton Dickinson FACStar by gating on a dot plot of forward versus side scatter. To assess the effects of K+, we employed a culture system similar to that used by others (51Walev I. Reske K. Palmer M. Valeva A. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thymocytes were cultured for 4 h in either normal or high K+ RPMI 1640 medium. Normal medium contains 5.3 mm KCl, 102.7 mmNaCl, whereas these concentrations were reversed in the high K+ medium. High K+ medium contains Na+ and K+ levels similar to intracellular levels while maintaining an isosmotic environment (measured on a Wescor vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Logan, UT)). Fetal bovine serum used with the high K+ medium was previously dialyzed (molecular mass cutoff <3000 kDa) against multiple changes of high K+medium. Following incubation, cells were processed for DNA analysis or caspase-3-like activity. Results were analyzed by Student's t test and considered significantly different from controls at p< 0.05. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation can be recapitulatedin vitro by incubation of isolated thymocyte nuclei with Ca2+ and Mg2+ in a process known as autodigestion. The nuclease is present within the nuclei in an inactive form, perhaps as a pro-enzyme, which is activated by the addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+. When KCl was included in this incubation, DNA degradation was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner with a K i ≈70 mm (Fig. 1). Inhibition was nearly complete at a K+ concentration equivalent to that normally found inside a cell (52Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Publishing, New York1983: 286Google Scholar). These data suggest that K+ efflux from an apoptotic cell is an important regulator of chromatin degradation. Interestingly, monovalent cations other than K+ (Na+, Cs+, Cd+, and Li+) were also effective at similar concentrations. Moreover, identical results were seen when Cl− was replaced with alternative anions (H2PO4−, C2H3O2−). The similar effects of all these ions suggest that this response is not cation- or anion-specific but, rather, a result of the ionic strength of the buffer. The importance of K+ in nuclease inhibitionin vivo lies in the fact that it is the only ion present at high concentrations within the cell. The results with K+and other ions were not due to alterations in osmotic pressure since 300 mm mannitol (which exerts an osmotic pressure equivalent to 150 mm KCl) had no effect (data not shown). The thymocyte autodigestion assay functionally consists of essentially two molecular events, activation of a latent nuclease and degradation of the chromatin substrate. To assess the effects of K+ on active enzyme, we employed an in vitro apoptosis assay (29Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,45Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1190-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 46Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this assay, the apoptotic nuclease(s) is first activated in thymocytes in vivo by injection of the rat with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX). Active nuclease is then extracted from the thymocyte nuclei and applied to nuclei from healthy, growing HeLa cells that contain no capacity for autodigestion (29Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this assay (Fig. 2 A), active nuclease was inhibited by K+ levels in a manner very similar to that seen in the autodigestion assays (K i ≈65 mm). Although intracellular levels of K+ clearly inhibit chromatin degradation by an active nuclease, it is possible that this effect is through a change in chromatin structure rather than a direct effect on the enzyme per se. To address this question we used linearized plasmid DNA as a substrate. As seen in Fig.2 B, K+ inhibited degradation of linearized pUC18 plasmid by thymocyte nuclear extracts in a dose-dependent manner (K i ≈80 mm). Together, the results from these two independent assays demonstrate that K+ levels expected to be found in nondying cells exert a direct inhibitory effect on the active apoptotic nuclease and again imply that a decrease in [K+] i is a prerequisite for apoptotic DNA degradation . Activation of caspases is a central event that occurs upstream of DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. To establish the extent of K+ effects on the apoptotic machinery, we assessed the effects of K+ on caspase activity. Fig. 3 A demonstrates that caspase-1-like activity (enzyme activity that is inhibited by Z-YVAD-al) remains low in extracts prepared from thymocytes treated with dexamethasone in vivo for 4 h (DEX), similar to extracts from untreated animals (CON). However, caspase-3-like activity (protease activity(ies) inhibited by Z-DEVD-al) is increased 9-fold in these same cytoplasmic extracts (Fig.3 B), suggesting that caspase-3-like enzymes may play a predominant role, relative to caspase-1-like enzymes, in DEX-induced rat thymocyte apoptosis. This result is consistent with other studies (53Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 54Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L. Salfeld J. Towne E. Tracey D. Wardell S. Wei F.-Y. Wong W. Kamen R. Seshadri T. Cell. 1995; 80: 401-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 C demonstrates that extracts from untreated thymocytes also contain pro-caspase-3-like enzymes that can be activated by preincubation for 1 h (30 °C) with 1 mm dATP and 10 μg/ml cytochrome c, similar to that seen with other cells (55Liu X. Kim C. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in caspase-3-like activity seen in Fig. 3 B is not due to an inability to extract protease from nondying cells. The greatly increased activity in the dATP and cytochrome c-activated extracts, compared with that present in extracts from thymocytes treated in vivowith dexamethasone, probably reflects the heterogeneous response to the steroid in vivo compared with the homogeneous activation accomplished in vitro with dATP and cytochrome c. More importantly, these results allow us to distinguish between the effects of K+ on the activity of mature caspase-3-like enzymes versus the activation of the proenzyme molecule. The effects of K+ on mature caspase-3-like activity was assessed using cytoplasmic extracts from thymocytes treated with dexamethasone in vivo. When K+ in the enzyme assay was varied from 0 to 200 mm, these levels had no effect on the activity of the active protease (Fig.4 A). Similarly, in vitro-activated caspase-3-like enzymes (i.e. extracts from untreated rats that had been previously activated in vitro by dATP and cytochrome c) were refractory to any inhibitory effects of K+ (Fig. 4 D). To assess the effects of K+ on activation of the pro-enzyme, we incubated the extracts from untreated animals with dATP and cytochromec for 1 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of KCl. As shown in Fig. 4 B, K+ inhibited thein vitro activation of caspase-3-like enzymes in a dose-dependent manner (K i ≈40 mm) with nearly complete suppression by 100 mmKCl. Thus, physiological concentrations of K+, expected to be found in nonapoptotic cells, can directly inhibit the activation of pro-caspase-3-like enzymes. Since the inhibitor used is likely to block the activity of several caspases, we sought to determine the specificity of K+ inhibition by evaluating the selective cleavage of pro-caspase-3 to its active subunits. Fig. 3 Cshows that dATP and cytochrome c stimulate cleavage of the 32-kDa in vitro transcribed/translated35S-pro-caspase-3 molecule into both the 17/11-kDa and 20/11-kDa subunits. Thus, at least one target of K+inhibition is caspase-3 itself occurring at the level of the cleavage reaction. Together, these data demonstrate that K+ levels found in non-apoptotic cells are sufficient to inhibit activation of caspase-3-like enzymes in vitro. The data have suggested that the intracellular K+ concentration must decrease within cells signaled to undergo apoptosis. Using inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry, we analyzed the relationship between intracellular K+levels and other features of apoptosis. As shown in Fig.5 A, viability remains >93% in this experiment, obviating any concerns with membrane integrity. As hypothesized, the average [K+] i decreased in the dying thymocyte population (Fig. 5 B) with a significant shift first detected after 4 h and a steady decrease thereafter to 56 mm at 8 h. Thus, the [K+] i in an apoptotic cell decreased to a level sufficient for enzyme activation. It should be noted, however, that these data represent the average [K+] i in the entire population of cells asynchronously undergoing apoptosis (56Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this reduction in [K+] i may not accurately reflect the magnitude of change that occurs within a single apoptotic cell. Previous estimates from our lab have placed the [K+] i in the shrunken apoptotic cells at ≈35 mm (56Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of chromatin integrity (Fig. 5 C) revealed the appearance of oligonucleosomal fragments after 4 h, the intensity of which continued to increase. Similarly, caspase-3-like activity (Fig.5 D) increased in a time-dependent manner with a significant increase detected as early as 2 h. The appearance of caspase activity prior to detection of a decrease in [K+] i seemed paradoxical in light of theK i for inhibition of activation of caspase-3-like enzymes. Thus we analyzed K+, caspase, and nuclease activities in the normal-sized and shrunken cells to determine if specific subpopulations were responsible for the detection of protease activity at 2 h. As previously shown, apoptosis proceeds asynchronously (56Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), forming two distinct subpopulations that can be defined by the flow cytometer based on forwa"
https://openalex.org/W1968599399,"Mitochondrial alterations including permeability transition (PT) constitute critical events of the apoptotic cascade and are under the control of Bcl-2 related gene products. Here we show that induction of PT is sufficient to activate CPP32-like proteases with DEVDase activity and the associated cleavage of the nuclear DEVDase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Thus, direct intervention on mitochondria using a ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepin receptor or a protonophore causes DEVDase activation. In addition, the DEVDase activation triggered by conventional apoptosis inducers (glucocorticoids or topoisomerase inhibitors) is prevented by inhibitors of PT. The protease inhibitor N-benzyloxycabonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD.fmk) completely prevents the activation of DEVDase and PARP cleavage, as well as the manifestation of nuclear apoptosis (chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, hypoploidy). In addition, Z-VAD.fmk delays the manifestation of apoptosis-associated changes in cellular redox potentials (hypergeneration of superoxide anion, oxidation of compounds of the inner mitochondrial membrane, depletion of non-oxidized glutathione), as well as the exposure of phosphatidylserine residues in the outer plasma membrane leaflet. Although Z-VAD.fmk retards cytolysis, it is incapable of preventing disruption of the plasma membrane during protracted cell culture (12 – 24 h), even in conditions in which it completely blocks nuclear apoptosis (chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation). Electron microscopic analysis confirms that cells treated with PT inducers alone undergo apoptosis, whereas cells kept in identical conditions in the presence of Z-VAD.fmk die from necrosis. These observations are compatible with the hypothesis that PT would be a rate limiting step in both the apoptotic and the necrotic modes of cell death. In contrast, it would be the availability of apoptogenic proteases that would determine the choice between the two death modalities."
https://openalex.org/W1975602003,"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a pleiotropic lymphokine whose production is restricted to activated T cells and NK cells. Along with other cytokines, IFN-gamma gene expression is inhibited by the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. We have previously identified an intronic enhancer region (C3) of the IFN-gamma gene that binds the NF-kappaB protein c-Rel and that shows partial DNA sequence homology with the cyclosporin A-sensitive NFAT binding site and the 3'-half of the NF-kappaB consensus site. Sequence analysis of the IFN-gamma promoter revealed the presence of two additional C3-related elements (C3-1P and C3-3P). In addition, an NF-kappaB site (IFN-gamma kappaB) was identified within the promoter region. Based on this observation, we have analyzed the potential role of NF-kappaB and NFAT family members in regulating IFN-gamma transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis demonstrated that after T cell activation, the p50 and p65 NF-kappaB subunits bind specifically to the newly identified IFN-gamma kappaB and C3-related sites. In addition, we identified the NFAT proteins as a component of the inducible complexes that bind to the C3-3P site. Site-directed mutagenesis and transfection studies demonstrate that calcineurin-inducible transcriptional factors enhance the transcriptional activity of the IFN-gamma promoter through the cyclosporin-sensitive C3-3P site, whereas NF-kappaB proteins functionally interact with the C3-related sites. In addition, when located downstream to the beta-galactosidase gene driven by the IFN-gamma promoter, the intronic C3 site worked in concert with both the IFN-gamma kappaB and the C3-3P site to enhance gene transcription. These results demonstrate that the coordinate activities of NFAT and NF-kappaB proteins are involved in the molecular mechanisms controlling IFN-gamma gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1973032213,"Shear stress, the tangential component of hemodynamic forces, activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction pathways in cultured vascular endothelial cells to induce the transcriptional activation of many immediate early genes. It appears that integrins, protein-tyrosine kinases, and the structural integrity of actin are important factors involved in these shear stress-induced responses. The underlying molecular events were investigated by the application of a shear stress of 12 dyn/cm2 on bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). We found that such a shear stress increased the tyrosine phosphorylation and the kinase activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and its association with growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2) in a rapid and transient manner, suggesting that FAK may be linked to these mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways through a Grb2·Son of sevenless (Sos) complex.

Hemodynamic forces play important roles in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis, but they can also be pathophysiological factors in conditions such as atherosclerosis. The involvement of hemodynamic forces in atherogenesis is manifested by the focal distribution of atherosclerotic lesions in the bifurcations and curved regions of the arterial tree where blood flow is disturbed with flow separation. Fluid shear stress, the tangential component of the hemodynamic forces, is low and unsteady in these lesion-prone areas (1Glagov S. Zarins C. Giddens D.P. Ku D.N. Arch. Pathol. Lab.

To unravel the roles played by hemodynamic forces in atherogenesis, flow channels have been used as in vitro systems to study functional changes of ECs in response to shear stress (for a review, see Ref. 3Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that fluid shear stress induces a rapid induction of immediate early genes. c-Src and Ras are important mediators of shear stress activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), also known as stress-activated protein kinases, to activate these immediate early genes (4Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Li Y.-S. Shyy J.Y.-J. Li S. Lee J.D. Su B. Karin M. Chien S. Mol. Cell.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: A18Google Scholar). Although many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the EC response to shear stress, including those via G-proteins, cytoskeletal structure, membrane-associated K+ channels, and integrins (for a review, see Ref. 9Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Peterson T.E. Tseng H. J. Biomechanics. 1995; 28: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), there is little experimental evidence indicating where and how the mechanotransduction occurs to activate the downstream signaling events, e.g. the activation of the MAPKs. In response to shear stress, concomitant with the elongation of ECs and the alignment of stress fibers with the direction of flow, the focal adhesions on the abluminal side of ECs undergo dynamic, local reorientation without a noticeable change in the total attachment area (10Davies P.F. Robotewskyj A. Griem M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2031-2038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the molecular level, such a dynamic rearrangement of focal adhesions may be related to spatial and temporal responses of the associated proteins, e.g. focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, tensin, and Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (for a review, see Ref. 11Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was recently shown that shear stress causes a rapid and transient activation of c-Src in ECs (6Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 98: 2623-2631Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Both chemical stimulation, e.g. the treatment of monocytes with monocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and the adhesion of NIH3T3 fibroblasts on fibronectin promote the interaction of growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2) with FAK (12Kharbanda S.

During cell attachment to the substratum, the association of integrins with the extracellular matrix (ECM) induces FAK autophosphorylation on Tyr-397, which leads to Src recruitment. The association of FAK with Src family PTKs at focal adhesions further increases the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-925, creating a Grb2 binding site (14Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 15Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell.

Shibata M. Yamakawa A. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9015-9019Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Grb2 is constitutively bound to Son of sevenless (Sos), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, via its SH3 domain. The Grb2·Sos complex activates Ras by converting the GDP-bound inactive state to the GTP-bound active state (19Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A.

Grb2 also associates with activated receptor tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor receptor and monocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, through the interaction of its SH2 with the phosphotyrosines of these receptor tyrosine kinases (21Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 22Suen K.L.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5161-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The association of Grb2·Sos with activated receptor tyrosine kinases brings Sos to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, where it can interact with membrane-associated Ras to catalyze GDP-GTP exchange (24Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Results from the current study demonstrate that shear stress induces the activation of FAK and the formation of FAK·Grb2·Sos ternary complex in ECs. This signaling pathway leads to the activation of both ERK and JNK. On the upstream side, integrins (e.g. VNR), by interacting with FAK, may be involved in the mechanotransduction that transfers fluid shear stress into biochemical signals. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated from bovine aorta either with collagenase or by gently scraping with a rubber policeman. BAEC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 mmeach of penicillin-streptomycin and sodium pyruvate. Cell cultures were maintained in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. All experiments were conducted with cultures prior to passage 10. Genistein (100 μm, from Sigma), cytochalasin B (1 μm, Sigma), and anti-αvβ3integrin (i.e. the VNR) mAb (clone LM609, 10 μg/ml, from Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used to treat BAEC in various experiments prior to the application of shear stress. A flow system was used to impose fluid shear stress on cultured ECs as described previously (25Frangos J.A. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.B. Ives C.L. Science. 1985; 227: 1477-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). In brief, a 75 × 38-mm glass slide was seeded with a confluent monolayer of BAEC. A silicone gasket was sandwiched between the glass slide and an acrylic plate to create a rectangular flow channel (0.025 cm in height, 2.5 cm in width, and 5.0 cm in length) with inlet and outlet for exposing the cultured BAEC to fluid shear stress. Steady, laminar flow across the channel was generated by using a peristaltic pump and a damping reservoir. During the flow experiments, the system was kept at 37 °C and equilibrated with 95% humidified air with 5% CO2. Plasmids hemagglutinin (HA)-JNK1, HA-FAK(wt), HA-FAK(F397Y), Myc-ERK2, and ΔmSos1 were described previously (13Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

The various DNA plasmids were transfected into BAEC at 80% confluence using the lipofectamine method (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation for 6 h, the transfected cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in fresh complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium to reach confluence. Within 48 h after transfection, the BAEC monolayer was serum-starved for 12 h and then either subjected to fluid shear stress or kept as static controls. The antibodies used in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were polyclonal anti-FAK (14Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), polyclonal anti-Grb2/Sem5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal anti-JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ERK2 mAb (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), anti-HA mAb (Boehringer Mannheim), and anti-c-Myc mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation, cells were scraped into lysis buffer; the lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed and used for either kinase activity assay or immunoblotting. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the samples, in 2% SDS sample buffer, were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For immunoblotting, proteins in the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% nonfat milk followed by incubation with the primary antibody in TTBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The bound primary antibodies were detected by using a goat anti-mouse or a goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). To assay endogenous ERK activity, BAEC were lysed in a kinase lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mmNaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm β-glycerophosphate). ERK2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK2 mAb and protein A-Sepharose beads. To perform immunocomplex kinase assays, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice in the lysis buffer and twice in a kinase assay buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 2 mmdithiothreitol). Two micrograms of myelin basic protein (MBP) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN, Irvine, CA) in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer with 25 μm ATP were added to each immunocomplex pellet for kinase reaction at 30 °C for 20 min. The phosphoproteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gels were dried for autoradiography. In the inhibition experiments, epitope-tagged Myc-ERK2 plasmids (3 μg) were co-transfected with plasmids encoding the various negative mutants (9 μg) into BAEC. After shear stress experiments, the cells were lysed in the kinase lysis buffer. Myc-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc mAb and protein A-Sepharose beads, followed by Myc-ERK2 kinase activity assays using the same procedures as described above. The kinase activities of the endogenous JNK1 and epitope-tagged HA-JNK1 were assessed by using essentially the same method as those for ERK, except that glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun-(1–79) fusion protein was used as the substrate. For FAK kinase activity assays, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-FAK followed by kinase activity assays in a kinase assay buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 25 μm ATP. Confluent monolayers of BAEC were fixed in acetone at room temperature for 3 min. The cells were then incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing a polyclonal anti-FAK (SC-903, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a concentration of 1:200 (v/v) and 20 μg/ml anti-VNR mAb (LM609, Chemicon) for 3 h at room temperature. The specimens were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Double immunostaining of FAK and VNR was observed under a confocal microscopy system (MRC-1000, Bio-Rad) equipped with an argon/krypton laser line, a scan head, and a Nikon Diaplot 300 inverted microscope. FITC was excited at a wavelength of 488 nm and detected within a band between 506 and 538 nm. Rhodamine was excited at 568 nm and detected within a band between 589 and 621 nm. We and others have previously shown that shear stress activates many transcriptional factors in ECs, including c-Jun and NF-κB, which lead to the induction of several inflammation-related genes such as the monocyte chemotactic protein-1 gene (28Shyy J.Y-J.

Commun. 1994; 201: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Some of this transcriptional activation is due, at least in part, to the activation of MAPKs, including ERK and JNK (4Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Li Y.-S. Shyy J.Y.-J. Li S. Lee J.D. Su B. Karin M. Chien S. Mol. Cell.

To examine the functional roles of PTKs and actin organization involved in shear stress activation of ERK and JNK, confluent monolayers of BAEC cultured on glass slides were pretreated with genistein (PTKs inhibitor) or cytochalasin B (actin microfilament disrupting reagent) followed by an exposure to fluid shear stress for 10 min (for ERK2 assay) or 30 min (for JNK1 assay); these are the time periods at which the shear-induced activities are highest for the two kinases (5Li Y.-S. Shyy J.Y.-J. Li S. Lee J.D. Su B. Karin M. Chien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Densitometry analysis indicates that shear stress drastically increased the kinase activities of ERK and JNK in cells that were treated with Me2SO as solvent control (compare first and second lanes in Fig.1, A and B). Pretreatment of BAEC with either genistein or cytochalasin B had little effect on the ERK2 activity but significantly decreased JNK1 activity in the static state as compared with Me2SO control. However, both the pretreatment abolished the shear stress activation of ERK2 and JNK1. These results suggest that the shear stress activation of MAPKs depends upon the upstream PTK signaling as well as the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. To investigate tyrosine phosphorylation in ECs in response to shear stress, confluent monolayers of BAEC were subjected to a shear stress of 12 dyn/cm2 for various lengths of time, and cell lysates from either static or sheared BAEC were immunoblotted with PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. Proteins with molecular masses of 45, 60, and 120 kDa were inducibly phosphorylated on tyrosines in the sheared cells (data not shown). To investigate whether the 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein corresponds to FAK, FAK was immunoprecipitated from these cell lysates and detected by immunoblotting with PY20 mAb. As shown in Fig.2 A, shear stress induced a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK with a molecular mass of 120 kDa. A maximum level was reached within 1 min, which was then decreased gradually. Fig. 2 B indicates that the kinase activity of FAK was also increased by shear stress. After a 5-min shearing treatment, the kinase activity of FAK increased by 3-fold (assessed by FAK autophosphorylation). The shear stress activation of FAK was also dependent upon actin structure integrity, since pretreatment of the cells with cytochalasin B attenuated such an activation. The activation of ERK and JNK in response to shear stress is mediated by Ras (5Li Y.-S. Shyy J.Y.-J. Li S. Lee J.D. Su B. Karin M. Chien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 7Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which is activated, in many other instances (e.g. epidermal growth factor stimulation), by the Grb2·Sos complex. Thus, we examined next whether shear stress induced the association of Grb2 with FAK in BAEC by immunoblotting the nitrocellulose membrane used in Fig. 2 A with a polyclonal anti-Grb2. As shown in Fig. 3, there was an increase in the amount of Grb2 co-immunoprecipitated with FAK in ECs subjected to shear stress for 1 min. The increased association of Grb2 with FAK lasted for at least 5 min and then decreased to a level similar to that in the static controls. In a separate experiment, cell lysates immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-Sos and immunoblotted with the polyclonal anti-Grb2 revealed a constant level of Grb2/Sos association in both static and sheared cells (data not shown), confirming that Grb2 is constitutively associated with Sos. Together, the results presented in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that the FAK-Grb2·Sos pathway is activated by shear stress, which may mediate the upstream PTK signaling to activate the downstream ERK and JNK pathways in ECs. We used dominant negative mutants of FAK and Sos to test the above hypothesis that the FAK-Grb2·Sos pathway is critical for shear stress activation of ERK and JNK. Tyr-397 of FAK is the major autophosphorylation site, which binds Src family PTK (13Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 17Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). FAK(wt) encodes a wild-type HA-tagged FAK. FAK(F397Y) encodes a mutated HA-FAK in which Tyr-397 has been replaced by Phe that blocks the binding of both Src family and Grb2 to FAK (31Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We co-transfected an empty plasmid pcDNA3, HA-FAK(wt), or HA-FAK(F397Y) together with either the epitope-tagged Myc-ERK2 or the epitope-tagged HA-JNK1 to assess the functional roles of the Tyr-397 of FAK in shear stress activation of ERK and JNK. The transfected cells were either kept as static controls or subjected to a treatment of shear stress for 10 min (for Myc-ERK2 assay) or 30 min (for HA-JNK1 assay) followed by immunocomplex kinase assays using MBP or GST-c-Jun-(1–79) fusion protein as the respective substrate. As shown in the top part of Fig.4 A, in cells transfected with the pcDNA3 empty vector or HA-FAK(wt), shear stress significantly increased the kinase activity of Myc-ERK2, as demonstrated by the enhanced MBP phosphorylation. In contrast, co-transfection of FAK(F397Y) blocked the shear stress activation of Myc-ERK2. Immunoblotting with anti-Myc mAb (bottom part of Fig.4 A) revealed that the Myc-ERK2 expression was not affected by the co-transfection of the various plasmids. While shear stress also enhanced the phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) in cells transfected with the pcDNA3 empty vector or HA-FAK(wt), co-transfection with FAK(F397Y) reduced the phosphorylation by 50% (Fig. 4 B). The phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) was attributed to the HA-JNK1 activity rather than that of the co-immunoprecipitated HA-FAK, since immunocomplex kinase assays indicated that the FAK immunoprecipitated from the same sample by polyclonal anti-FAK could not phosphorylate GST-c-Jun-(1–79) (data not shown). The bottom part of Fig.4 B also shows that the HA-JNK1 expression was not affected by the co-transfection of the various plasmids. Similar experiments were performed by using ΔmSos1 to assess the effects of functional blocking of Grb2·Sos on the shear stress activation of ERK and JNK. In ΔmSos1, the segment between nucleotides 618 and 1036 that corresponds to the guanine nucleotide exchange domain in the wild-type Sos cDNA has been deleted. Hence, the encoded protein acts as a dominant negative mutant of Sos (27Sakaue M. Bowtell D. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, co-transfection of ΔmSos1 caused decreased phosphorylation of both MBP and GST-c-Jun-(1–79) in response to shear stress, indicating a suppression of Myc-ERK2 and HA-JNK1 activities in these cells. The results presented in Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that shear stress activates FAK-Grb2·Sos in ECs, which is a functional signaling pathway upstream of ERK and JNK. The adhesion of fibroblasts to fibronectin-coated dishes promotes the interaction of Grb2 with FAK (14Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Activation of α2β1 integrin in T lymphocytes results in an increase in the GTP-bound Ras (32Kapron-Bras C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Jeevaratnam P. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20701-20704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cyclic stretch-induced mitogenic response of smooth muscle cells is dependent upon fibronectin and vitronectin receptors (33Wilson E. Sudhir K. Ives H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These previous studies, together with the finding that actin organization is important for the shear stress activation of ERK and JNK (Fig. 1), prompted us to investigate the roles of integrins in the shear stress activation of ERK and JNK. We chose VNR (i.e.αvβ3 integrin) in this study due to its abundance in EC and its presence in the atherosclerotic plaques (34Hoshiga M. Alpers C.E. Smith L.L. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of BAEC were preincubated for 2 h with antibody LM609, an anti-αvβ3 mAb that has been shown to inhibit endothelial spreading (35Sriramarao P. Mendler M. Bourdon M.A. J.

https://openalex.org/W2112620000,"Protein kinase B (PKB) is a member of the second messenger-dependent family of serine/threonine kinases that has been implicated in signaling pathways downstream of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Here we report the characterization of the human β-isoform of PKB (PKBβ). PKBβ is ubiquitously expressed in a number of human tissues, with mRNA and protein levels elevated in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. After transfection into HEK-293 or COS-1 cells, PKBβ is activated 2- to 12-fold by mitogens and survival factors. Activation was due to phosphorylation on Thr-309 and Ser-474, which correspond to Thr-308 and Ser-473 implicated in the regulation of PKBα. Both phosphorylation and activation were prevented by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Moreover, membrane-targeted PKBβ was constitutively activated when overexpressed in HEK-293 cells. Although the specific activity of PKBβ was lower than that of PKBα toward Crosstide as a substrate (23 nmol/min/mg compared with 178 nmol/min/mg for PKBα), both enzymes showed similar substrate specificities. Using confocal microscopy, we show that activation of PKBβ results in its nuclear translocation within 20 to 30 min after stimulation. These observations provide evidence that PKBβ undergoes nuclear translocation upon mitogenic activation and support a role for PKB in signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases to the nucleus through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase."

Functional genomics involves the development of global experimental approaches for analyzing gene function by utilizing information and reagents provided by structural genomics. Functional genomic data needs to be generated by rigorous experiments to allow a fair evaluation of the emerging technologies. The data should also be made publicly accessible in order for the scientific community to gain maximum benefit.

We have obtained a monoclonal antibody (295) to a cell surface molecule present on toxin-sensitive HL60 cells that can inhibit cytolysis by both RTX toxins. Utilization of this monoclonal antibody for immunoaffinity purification of detergent-solubilized target cell membranes yielded two polypeptide chains of approximate molecular masses of 100 and 170 kDa. Microsequencing of tryptic peptides from the two proteins showed complete homology with CD11a and CD18, the two subunits of the β2 integrin, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). Anti-CD11a and CD18 monoclonal antibodies also inhibited RTX toxin-mediated cytolysis. Direct binding experiments demonstrated the ability of an immobilized RTX to bind LFA-1 heterodimers present in a detergent lysate of human HL60 target cells. Transfection of CD11a and CD18 integrin genes into a cell line (K562) that is not sensitive to either RTX toxin resulted in LFA-1 expressing cells, KL/4, that were sensitive to both toxins. These experiments identify LFA-1 as a cell surface receptor that mediates toxicity of members of this family of pore-forming toxins.

These experiments identify LFA-1 as a cell surface receptor that mediates toxicity of members of this family of pore-forming toxins. A paradigm emerging from studies of bacterial protein toxins is that target cell recognition is often the initial event of a multistep process ultimately leading to diverse mechanisms of cell death. For example, colicins (1Pattus F. Massotte D. Wilmsen H.U. Lakey J. Tsernoglou D. Tucker A.X. Parker M.W. Experientia. 1990; 46: 180-192PubMed Google Scholar) bind to various outer membrane proteins ofEscherichia coli (2Parker M.W. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. Pattus F. Trends Biochem.

Leukotoxin kills cells of the lymphocytic and monomyelocytic lineage of man and some higher nonhuman primates. The narrow host range of leukotoxin suggests that the toxin may bind a specific cell surface receptor. However, no target cell receptors for RTX toxins have yet to be identified. Both toxin-sensitive and several toxin-resistant cells (12Simpson D.L. Berthold P. Taichman N.S. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are capable of absorbing toxin from culture supernatants, indicating that simple adsorption of the toxin onto a cell membrane is not enough to cause cell death. The ability of these toxins to adhere to various cell surfaces also indicates that classical experiments designed to detect the presence of a receptor such as saturation of binding or inhibition of labeled toxin binding with excess unlabeled toxin will not be effective in detecting cell surface receptors for this family of toxins. We have employed an alternative approach to identify a cell surface molecule that mediates RTX toxin cytotoxicity. Balb/cJ female mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) 12–16 weeks old were immunized intravenously with 2 × 107 HL60 cells, boosted on days 10, 20, and 30 with an equal number of cells and allowed to rest for 60 days. 3 days before fusion, the animals again received 2 × 107 HL60 cells intravenously. On the day of fusion, spleens were removed aseptically, and a single cell suspension was prepared with a loose fitting tissue homogenizer. The cells were washed once in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, and the erythrocytes were lysed with 0.17m ammonium chloride-Tris buffer. Spleen cells recovered in this manner had a viability of >95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Sp2/0-Agl4 myeloma cells were mixed with spleen cells (1:10) and centrifuged. A 1-ml portion of 30% polyethylene glycol solution (PEG 1000; J. T. Baker Chemical Co., Phillipsburg, NJ) was slowly added to the cell pellet. The pellet was gently stirred, allowed to set for 1 min, and then dispersed by the addition of 50 ml of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium. After centrifugation, the cells were suspended in 30 ml of Kennett's HY medium (4.5 g/liter Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with high glucose, glutamine, 10% NCTC 109, 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% 0.15 mg/ml oxaloacetate, 0.05 mg/ml pyruvate, and 0.2 unit/ml bovine insulin) and 1% 5 mmhypoxanthine and 0.8 mm thymidine), and 0.1-ml portions were placed in 96-well tissue culture plates. The next day, an additional 0.1 ml of medium containing aminopterin (0.04 μm) was added to each well. Cells were fed every 3–4 days by drawing off 0.1 ml of spent medium. Clones were visible 7–9 days after the fusion, and when they covered approximately one-half of the bottom of the well, they were screened for their ability to inhibit RTX-mediated cytotoxicitv in the biological assay (13Lally E.T.

Leukotoxic activity of recombinant ltxA and hylA gene products was determined essentially as described previously (13Lally E.T. Golub E.E. Kieba I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31289-31295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli containingltxC and either ltxA or hylA in the pOTSNco12 plasmid were grown to late log phase, induced, and sonicated. The bacterial sonicate was incubated with target cells at 37 °C for 45 min. RTX-sensitive HL60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 and used as positive controls, whereas negative controls consisted of incubating target cells with: (i) tissue culture medium, (ii) sonicates from uninduced bacteria, or (iii) sonicates from induced bacteria that contained the pOTSNco12 plasmid without an insert. The cells were placed on ice, 100 μl of trypan blue (0.4%) were added, and surviving cells were counted in a hemocytometer. At least four fields were counted in triplicate and averaged for each dilution assayed. The percentage of lysis was calculated by dividing the number of surviving cells by the number of cells in the negative controls and subtracting from 100. Prior to incubation with anti-integrin antibodies, HL60, KL/4, and K562 cells were washed twice in cold 1% BSA PBS and incubated with mouse IgG myeloma protein (10 μg; 30 min on ice) that was the same isotype as the anti-integrin antibody. Immunoglobulin bound during this incubation occurs via the F(c) receptor. After washing again in cold 1% BSA PBS, the cells were incubated with an anti-integrin antibody for 15 min, washed, and incubated for an additional 15 min with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemical). The fluorescence level of a control group composed of cells, mouse IgG myeloma protein, and FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG represented the background staining due to Fc-bound Ig. The fluorescence level of our experimental groups were then gated on the control group to determine the amount of anti-integrin antibody bound on the cells. After incubations, cells were washed, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and stored at 4 °C until analysis. 5000–10000 cells were read per sample on a FACStar Plus™ (ABI, Mountain View CA) flow cytometer. HL60 cells were pelleted (2000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and washed with PBS, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin). The suspension was vortexed intermittently on ice for 30 min and centrifuged (14,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant fraction was used for protein isolation. The supernatant was batch extracted with 0.5 ml of mAb295-activated Sepharose. The resin was pelleted by centrifugation (3000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C) and washed three times with 15 ml of wash buffer (10 mm phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.5% Triton X-100). Bound protein was eluted with 100 mm triethanolamine, pH 11.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and concentrated by lyophilization. The proteins were run on 8% SDS-PAGE gels using Bio-Rad reagents. Gel solutions were filtered (0.2 μm) and stored at 4 °C prior to use. Gels (including the stacker) were cast and allowed to stand for 24–48 h at room temperature (22 °C) prior to use, and 0.1 mmthioglycolate was added to the upper chamber buffer prior to electrophoresis. Eluted proteins were solubilized in 5 × buffer containing 0.5 m sucrose and heated at 37 °C for 15 min. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Prior to transfer, polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was pre-wet in MeOH for 10 s and then in transfer buffer with 10% MeOH for 5 min. After transfer, the membrane was rinsed with Milli-Q® water three times for 5 min. The membrane was stained with Amido Black, and proteins of 100 and 170 kDa were cut from the membrane and digested with trypsin. The resultant tryptic fragments were separated by HPLC, and peptides from each protein were selected for sequencing. Purified A. actinomycetemcomitansleukotoxin (20Lear J.D. Furblur U.G. Lally E.T.

The beads were washed with PBS and incubated with 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 1 h to block the remaining sites. CHAPS extracts (10 μg of protein) of HL-60 cells were incubated with the derivatized beads for 15 h at 4 °C in PBS. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) followed by a final rinse in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Bound protein was eluted from the beads using SDS gel loading buffer and size fractionated on 8–16% SDS gradient gels under nonreducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked in PBS, 5% milk and subsequently incubated with anti-LFA-1 antibodies for 15 h at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times with PBST and incubated with a goat anti-mouse HRP conjugate in PBS, 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed with PBST and developed using chemiluminescent detection. K562 transfectants (21Ortlepp S. Stephens P.E. Hogg N. Figdor C.G. Robinson M.K. Eur. J.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), which is present in both normal and transfected cells, was used as a control gene (25Reed J.C. Krajewski S. Kitada S. Miyashita T. Herzenberg L.A.

Messenger RNA was prepared from KL4 and K562 cell lines using the Quick Prep micro mRNA purification kit (Pharmacia 27-9255-01) followed by first strand cDNA synthesis using You-Prime First-Strand Beads (Pharmacia 27-9264-01) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequent amplification was performed using a Perkin-Elmer 9600 Thermocycler and Ready To Go PCR beads (Pharmacia 27-9555-01) under the following conditions. The primers for PCR were: forward primer CD11a, GGGAATGACCTTGGCAACAGACCCCACAGAT; reverse primer CD11a, GGGTCTCCTGACTCTCCTTGGTCT; forward primer CD18, ATCCTGACTCCATTCGCTGC; reverse primer CD18, CTCGGTCTGAAACTGGTTGG; forward primer GADPH, CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA; reverse primer GADPH, TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC.

The internal probes for Southern blotting were: CD11a, CGCGACAGAGGTGTTCCGGGAGGAGC (expected PCR product = 610 bp); CD18, GGACCTCTCCTACTCCATGCTTGATGACCTCAGG (expected PCR product = 496 bp). Initial experiments were designed to identify a monoclonal antibody that has specificity for a cell surface molecule on target cells and is capable of inhibiting RTX-mediated cytotoxicity. Balb/cJ mice were immunized with HL60 cells via the intravenous route. Spleens from immunized mice were removed and fused with Sp2/0-Ag14, a mouse myeloma cell line. Hybridoma culture supernatants were screened for their ability to inhibit HL60 cytotoxicity by two RTX toxins, E. coli α-hemolysin, andA. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin. Of 2,500 clones screened, one clone, mAb295 (IgG1,κ), was noted to be an efficient inhibitor of the cytotoxic activity of both toxins (Fig.1 A). Fluorescent cell sorting analysis demonstrated that the mAb295 antigen resides on the cell surface of human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes (Fig. 1 B). To identify the mAb295 antigen, HL60 cell membrane extracts were first solubilized with 0.5% CHAPS, passed through a CNBr Sepharose 4B-mAb295 affinity column (26Hughes E.N. Engelsberg B.N. Billings P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13520-13527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then analyzed with SDS-PAGE. Examination of the gels revealed two proteins of relative molecular masses of 100 and 170 kDa had bound to the mAb affinity resin. (Fig. 2, lane 3). No evidence of these bands was noted when the same HL60 CHAPS lysate was passed over an affinity column with a control myeloma protein attached (Fig. 2, lane 4). Eluted proteins from a mAb295 affinity column were subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After staining with Amido Black, proteins of interest were cut from the blot and subjected to trypsin digestion. Peptides were separated by HPLC and sequenced by solid phase amino acid sequencing. Two tryptic peptides from the 170-kDa protein were sequenced and showed complete homology with sequences from CD11a, whereas three peptides from the 100-kDa band were sequenced and found to be identical to sequences of CD18 (Table I). The CD11a and CD18 polypeptides form the α and β subunits, respectively, of a leukocyte-specific β2 integrin, LFA-1.Table IAmino acid sequences of tryptic peptides derived from 100- and 170-kDa proteins present in the eluate from a mAb295-Sepharose columnProteinTryptic peptideMass1-aMass was determined by mass spectrometry/calculated.SequenceHomology170 kDa11583.8 /1583.9AGYLGYTVTWLPSRCD11a (residues 401–414)22734.3 /3205.5FGEAITALTDINGDGLVDVAVGAPLEEQGAVYCD11a (residues 521–552)100 kDa11884.1 /1881.2SAVGELSEDSSNVVHLIKCD18 (residues 332–349)21810 /1810LLVFATDDGFHFAGDGKCD18 (residues 250–266)3ND1-bND, not determined.

Sequences were then used to query the protein data base, and homologous sequences were identified. Identification of LFA-1 as the molecule that is recognized by mAb295 led us to explore the possibility that anti-CD11 and anti-CD18 monoclonal antibodies might also inhibit RTX-mediated cytotoxicity. A panel of anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibodies was screened to identify those inhibiting RTX toxin-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig.3 A). TS1/22, an anti-CD11a antibody, and three anti-CD18 antibodies (TS1/18, KIM127, and KIM185) were capable of inhibiting RTX cytolysis. The possibility that the experimental observations were due to Fc receptor binding was ruled out by incubating cells with an isotype-matched (IgG1,κ) control antibody, MOPC 21. If inhibition of RTX cytotoxicity was due to anti-integrin antibodies binding via the Fc receptor and not to the β2 integrin, then MOPC21 would be equally effective inhibiting target cell killing as the anti-integrin antibodies. This was not observed. To determine the region of LFA-1 recognized by mAb295, antibodies (TS1/22, TS1/18, KIM127, and KIM185) that recognize CD11a-CD18 were used in a series of cross-blocking experiments. Of those tested, only TS1/22 (Fig. 3 B), an antibody recognizing the 200-amino acid I domain of CD11a (27Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), inhibited mAb295 binding, an indication that the mAb295 epitope also resides on CD11a. Several mechanisms could account for inhibition of RTX-mediated cytotoxicity by anti-β2 integrin monoclonal antibodies. A likely explanation is steric hinderance. The monoclonal antibody then interferes with binding of the toxin to the same integrin heterodimer. Alternatively, the toxin does not bind to β2 integrins, but rather the interaction of antibody and integrin effect changes in the cell surface, rendering it impervious to toxin binding at a distal site. To resolve this issue, a series of experiments examining the ability of RTX toxins to bind directly to β2 integrins was initiated. Purified A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin was passively adsorbed onto polystyrene beads, and additional protein binding was blocked by incubating the beads with BSA. The toxin beads were then incubated with a 0.5% CHAPS lysate from HL60 cells. Bound protein was eluted from the beads, run on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and incubated with either 25.3.1 (an anti-CD11a antibody) or KIM185 (an anti-CD18 antibody). The Western blot shows that CD11a (Fig. 4 A,lane 3) and CD18 (Fig. 4 A, lane 7) polypeptides are detected in the eluate from RTX toxin beads. Control beads coated with BSA alone showed no evidence of binding of either integrin unit (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and6). Furthermore, when 10 μg of soluble A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin was added to the CHAPS lysate, the ability of the RTX toxin beads to bind either component of the LFA-1 heterodimer was completely abolished (Fig. 4 A,lanes 4 and 8). To further assess binding specificity, we determined the ability of mAb295 to block LFA-1 toxin interaction (Fig. 4 B). Preincubation of HL-60 lysates with mAb295 (10 μg/tube) diminished integrin binding to beads (Fig.4 B, lanes 4 and 8). No inhibition of binding was observed when the lysates were incubated with an equivalent amount of an isotype control antibody, MOPC21 (Fig. 4 B,lanes 3 and 7). A transfected cell line was employed to further define the involvement of CD18 and CD11a genes in RTX toxin-mediated cytotoxicity. K562, a human erythroleukemia cell line that does not express detectable CD11a or CD18 was transfected with both CD11a and CD18 in a single plasmid. One of the transfected cell lines, KL/4, was shown to express both CD11a and CD18 genes using reverse transcriptase-PCR. Analysis of cDNA revealed the expected 610- and 496-bp PCR products for CD11a (Fig.5, lane 1) and CD18 (Fig. 5,lane 2) genes in KL/4 cells. No signal for CD11a or CD18 was detected in mock transfected control K562/gen cells (Fig. 5,lanes 4 and 5). Both cell lines produced detectable levels of the control gene, GADPH (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 6). The 610- and 496-bp PCR products amplified from KL/4 hybridized to internal sequence probes of CD11a (Fig. 5,lane a) and CD18 (Fig. 5, lane b), respectively. FACS analysis of transfected KL/4 cells (TableII) demonstrated cell surface expression of CD11a and CD18 gene products, whereas no evidence of LFA-1 expression was observed on K562 cells. Fluorescence intensity levels of the two proteins appeared similar, indicating that production of the two proteins is comparable. In addition, the failure to demonstrate expression of either CD11b or CD11c chains demonstrate that LFA-1 is the only β2-integrin expressed on KL/4 cells. Functional characterization of the LFA-1 on cells (KL/4) has been described previously (21Ortlepp S. Stephens P.E. Hogg N. Figdor C.G. Robinson M.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Integrin expression by KL/4 cells appears to be in a low state of activation as determined by their inability to bind either ICAM-1 ligand or antibodies that recognize activation epitopes.Table IIExpression of β2 integrin heterodimers in transfected K562 cellsMOPC 21 (control)2-aSigma (catalog number M9269).38 (CD11a)2-bR & D Systems (catalog numbers BCA1, BCA2, and BCA3).44 (CD11b)2-bR & D Systems (catalog numbers BCA1, BCA2, and BCA3).3.9 (CD11c)2-bR & D Systems (catalog numbers BCA1, BCA2, and BCA3).TS1/18 (CD18)2-cEndogen, Inc.

K562 cells do not express β2 integrin gene products and are resistant to the lytic effects of E. coliα-hemolysin or A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin (12Simpson D.L. Berthold P. Taichman N.S. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, K562/gen, a mock transfected K562 cell control, showed no evidence of susceptibility to either toxin (Fig.6 A). However, when K562 cells were transfected with CD11a and CD18 genes on the same plasmid, the resultant cell line (KL/4) was sensitive to both RTX toxins (Fig.6 A). The lethal effects of the RTX toxins could be ablated by preincubation of KL/4 cells with anti-CD11a monoclonal antibody mAb295 but not by MOPC21, an isotype matched control antibody. Transmission electron microscopy corroborated these experiments. K562 cells incubated with A. actinomycetemcomitansleukotoxin remain uniform in size and shape with prominent cellular organelles and are morphologically similar to untreated cells (Fig.6 B, plate 1). In contrast, KL/4 cells showed significant morphologic changes after toxin exposure. In half of the cells we noted an increase in size associated with vacuolated cytoplasm and degenerating organelles (Fig. 6 B, plate 2,arrow). The remainder of KL/4 cells showed no evidence of RTX intoxication. KL/4 cells preincubated with mAb295 (10 μg/ml) were morphologically similar to untreated controls (data not shown). We have used mAbs, direct binding, and gene transfection experiments to demonstrate that A. actinomycetemcomitansleukotoxin and E. coli α-hemolysin bind to CD11a-CD18 integrin (LFA-1) on human target cells. LFA-1 is found on most circulating leukocytes (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages) but not on cells of nonhematopoetic origin. A member of the β2 integrin family, LFA-1, mediates leukocyte binding to endothelial cells via interactions with several members of the ICAM family (28Larson R.S. Springer T.A. Immunol.

Virtually the same photosystem II (PSII) core phosphoproteins (D1, D2, CP43, and the<i>psbH</i> gene product) and the light-harvesting chlorophyll<i>a/b</i> complex II (LHCII) phosphopolypeptides (LHCB1 and LHCB2), as earlier identified by radiolabeling experiments, were recognized in both pumpkin and spinach leaves. Notably, the PSII core proteins and LHCII polypeptides were found to have a different phosphorylation pattern <i>in vivo</i> with respect to increasing irradiance. Phosphorylation of the PSII core proteins in leaf discs attained the saturation level at the growth light intensity, and this level was also maintained at high irradiances. Maximal phosphorylation of LHCII polypeptides only occurred at low light intensities, far below the growth irradiance, and then drastically decreased at higher irradiances. These observations are at variance with traditional studies <i>in vitro</i>, where LHCII shows a light-dependent increase in phosphorylation, which is maintained even at high irradiances. Only a slow restoration of the phosphorylation capacity for LHCII polypeptides at the low light conditions occurred <i>in vivo</i> after the high light-induced inactivation. Furthermore, if thylakoid membranes were isolated from the high light-inactivated leaves, no restoration of LHCII phosphorylation took place <i>in vitro</i>. However, both the high light-induced inactivation and low light-induced restoration of LHCII phosphorylation seen <i>in vivo</i> could be mimicked in isolated thylakoid membranes by incubating with reduced and oxidized dithiothreitol, respectively. We propose that stromal components are involved in the regulation of LHCII phosphorylation <i>in vivo,</i> and inhibition of LHCII phosphorylation under increasing irradiance results from reduction of the thiol groups in the LHCII kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2078506029,"Leptin is a hormone produced in adipose cells that regulates energy expenditure, food intake, and adiposity. In mice, we observed that circulating leptin levels increase 20-40-fold during pregnancy. Pregnant ob/ob females had no detectable serum leptin, demonstrating that the heterozygous conceptus was not the source of the leptin. However, leptin RNA and protein levels in maternal adipose tissue were not elevated. The circulating leptin was in a high molecular weight complex, suggesting that the rise in leptin was due to expression of a binding protein. Indeed, quantitative assays of serum leptin binding capacity revealed a 40-fold increase, coincident with the rise in serum leptin. Leptin binding activity reached a capacity of 207 +/- 15 nmol/liter of serum at day 18 of gestation, and half-maximal binding was observed with approximately 3 nM leptin. The binding protein was purified and partially sequenced, revealing sequence identity to the extracellular domain of the leptin receptor. We found that the placenta produces large amounts of the OB-Re isoform of leptin receptor mRNA, which encodes a soluble binding protein. Thus, the extreme hyperleptinemia of late pregnancy is attributable to binding of the leptin by a secreted form of the leptin receptor made by the placenta."

Northern blots were hybridized (Rapid-hyb, Amersham Corp.) using probes (leptin, bp 463–3426 in GenBank™/EBI accession numberU43653, or β-actin; labeled by random priming) and washed twice (0.5 × SSC, 20 min, 65 °C). 5′-RACE 3The abbreviations used are: RACE, Rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MER, medium reiteration frequency repeat; PLE, placental leptin enhancer; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s). was performed using a commercial kit and human placental cDNA (CLONTECH).

Competitor oligonucleotides were added prior to the addition of nuclear extract. Polyclonal antiserum to Sp1 (2 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added after the probe and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C before electrophoresis. Methylation interference analysis was performed essentially as described (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1997Google Scholar). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used in gel mobility shift assays (a lowercase letter indicates an introduced mutation): PLE1, CAGTACCCTCAGGCTTACTAGGGTGGTGAAAAACTC; mPLE1, CAGTACtagtAGGCTTACTAGGGTGGTGAAAAACTC; PLE2, AGGGTGGTGAAAAACTCCGCCCTGGTAAATTTGTGG; mPLE2, AGGGTGGTGAAAAACTCtagtCTGGTAAATTTGTGG; PLE3, CCTGGTAAATTTGTGGTCAGACCAGTTTTCTGCTCT; mPLE3, CCTGGTAAATTTGTGagtAGcttAGTTTTCTGCTCT; oligo D, TGCTCTCGAACACTGTTTTCTGTTGTTTAAGATGTT; and Sp1, GAATCCTAACTGGGCGGAGTTATGCTGGTG. Leptin expression in adipose tissue (both white and brown) has been reported in a number of species. The only other tissue identified as having significant amounts of leptin mRNA is human placenta (27Green E.D. Maffei M. Braden V.V. Proenca R. DeSilva U. Zhang Y. Chua S.C. Leibel R.L. Weissenbach J. Friedman J.M. Genome Res. 1995; 5: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, we did not detect leptin mRNA in mouse placenta,1 so a Northern blot was performed to confirm that human placenta contains leptin mRNA (Fig.1). Leptin RNA was detected in human placenta at a level roughly 100-fold lower than that in white adipose tissue. It was the same size as in adipose tissue, ∼4 kb. Additional confirmation that leptin is expressed in placenta came from the expressed sequence tag data base, which contains leptin cDNAs in libraries from both 8–9 week and term placentas. Having established that human placenta contains leptin mRNA, we performed 5′-RACE to determine if placenta and adipose tissue use the same promoter. All six clones extending upstream of exon 2 agreed with the reported sequence for exon 1 from adipose tissue (data not shown). Thus, the same promoter is used for placental and adipose expression. To search for DNA elements important for placental expression, reporter constructs containing from 218 to 2922 bp of 5′-flanking genomic DNA were used in transient expression assays. Expression of these leptin promoter-luciferase reporters was studied in four cell types: primary rat adipocytes, HeLa cells, and the choriocarcinoma cell lines JEG-3 (32Kohler P.O. Bridson W.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1971; 32: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and JAR (33Pattillo R.A. Ruckert A. Hussa R. Berstein R. Delfs E. In Vitro. 1971; 6: 398-399Google Scholar). In each case, all constructs directed transcription at higher levels than the promoterless pGL3-basic vector (Fig. 2). Intriguingly, when the 5′-flanking region was lengthened from −1546 to −1951, expression increased significantly in the choriocarcinoma cell lines but not in adipose and HeLa cells (Fig. 2). These data suggest that the 400-bp region from 1951 to 1546 bp upstream of the promoter contains a placenta-selective enhancer. Next, the 400-bp region was tested directly for enhancer activity using the heterologous SV40 promoter to drive luciferase. In JEG-3 cells, this DNA caused 8–9-fold enhancement, independent of its orientation, at a distance of 2.1 kb from the promoter (Fig.3). The 400-bp region could not increase expression in the absence of a promoter and did not have promoter activity itself. These data demonstrate that the DNA from 1951 to 1546 bp upstream of the leptin promoter contains an enhancer. To identify the boundaries of the enhancer, deletion constructs were tested for enhancer activity (Fig. 4). Deletions from the 3′-end to −1645, −1748, or −1847 reduced, but did not abolish, luciferase expression. In contrast, any deletion of the 5′-end resulted in complete loss of enhancer activity. Thus, the 100-bp region from 1946- to 1847-bp upstream of the promoter is sufficient for partial leptin enhancer activity in JEG-3 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to identify the sequence elements and proteins responsible for the enhancer activity. Four overlapping oligonucleotides (designated PLE1, PLE2, PLE3, and oligo D) were used to screen the 100-bp region. With nuclear extracts from JEG-3 cell and human placenta, protein binding was detected to PLE1, PLE2, and PLE3 but not to oligo D (Fig.5 A). Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells showed abundant binding to PLE2, slight binding to PLE1, and none to PLE3. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the proteins binding to PLE3, and possibly PLE1, are placenta-specific. Additional support comes from the observation that no PLE3 binding activity was detected by mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from rat liver, undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, rat adipocytes, or erythroid K562 cells (data not shown). Since the PLE2 oligonucleotide contains a canonical Sp1 sequence (CCGCCC; Ref. 34Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar), we tested whether Sp1 is responsible for the observed protein binding to PLE2. An oligonucleotide with an authentic Sp1 site gave the same pattern as PLE2 upon protein binding (Fig.5 A). Mutation of the Sp1 motif in PLE2 (mPLE2) abolished protein binding to PLE2 (Fig. 5 A). Finally, antibodies to Sp1 caused a decreased mobility of the protein-PLE2 complex (Fig.5 B). Thus, Sp1 is able to bind the PLE2 sequence and appears to account for most of the binding activity to PLE2 in JEG-3 cells. To identify specific residues in the PLE1 and PLE3 binding sites, methylation interference analysis was performed. Methylation of guanines at positions −1946, −1943, −1942, −1941, −1939, −1937, −1936, and −1935 in PLE1 and at −1894, −1892, −1888, and −1887 in PLE3 reduced binding to these elements (Fig.6 A). This information was used to design mutations of the PLE1 and PLE3 binding sites (Fig.6 B), which were incorporated into oligonucleotides (mPLE1 and mPLE3, sequences shown under “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, these mutant oligonucleotides were unable to form the PLE1 and PLE3 complexes (not shown) and were unable to compete for protein binding to the unmutated sites (Fig. 6 C). Binding to PLE1 was not competed by PLE2, PLE3, or Sp1. Binding to PLE3 was not competed by PLE1, PLE2, or the following binding sites for transcription factors known to regulate placental genes: Sp1 (35Sadasivan E. Cedeno M.M. Rothenberg S.P. J. Biol.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that the leptin enhancer contains three independent protein-binding sites: an Sp1 site (PLE2) and two novel placenta-selective binding sites, PLE1 and PLE3. Since no protein binding to the 3′ 40 bp of the 100-bp enhancer was detected, a 60-bp enhancer comprising the 5′-end was tested for enhancer activity. A reporter using the 60-bp enhancer (p1875) expressed luciferase at a slightly higher level than the 100-bp construct (p1860) (Fig. 7). It is possible that the 3′ end of the 100-bp region has some inhibitory activity. The contributions of the PLE1, PLE2, and PLE3 sites to the function of the placental leptin enhancer was examined in the context of the 60-bp enhancer. Mutation of the Sp1 site at PLE2 had no effect on activity (Fig. 7). However, mutation of PLE1 reduced enhancement by 56%, and mutation of PLE3 abolished enhancer activity. Similarly, constructs containing only PLE1 (p1870) or PLE3 (p1871, p1877) did not have enhancer activity. Triplication of the PLE3 motif created a construct which showed 32-fold enhancement. Thus, as measured in JEG-3 cells, the PLE3 motif is essential for enhancer activity and when multimerized is a strong enhancer. To examine the tissue specificity of the leptin enhancer, the reporter plasmids were tested for activity in four different cell types (Fig.8). Transient transfection expression experiments confirmed that the enhancer works in the choriocarcinoma cell lines (JEG-3, JAR) but not in adipocytes or HeLa cells. The triplicated PLE3 element stimulated transcription in JEG-3 and JAR, but not in HeLa cells. These results suggest that the enhancer and the transcription factor binding to the PLE3 site are placenta-selective. Leptin is expressed predominantly in adipocytes where its production correlates with the degree of adiposity. However, leptin is also made by the placenta (27Green E.D. Maffei M. Braden V.V. Proenca R. DeSilva U. Zhang Y. Chua S.C. Leibel R.L. Weissenbach J. Friedman J.M. Genome Res. 1995; 5: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We identified an enhancer located 1.9 kb upstream of the human leptin gene. It contains three protein binding elements, PLE1–3, and transient expression experiments demonstrate that the enhancer works in choriocarcinoma lines but not in adipose or HeLa cells. The proteins binding to the PLE3 motif and possibly to the PLE1 motif may be placenta-specific and contribute to the activity of the enhancer in JEG-3 cells. Sp1 binds at the PLE2 motif but does not contribute to enhancer activity in these cells. We concentrated on PLE3 which, when triplicated, constitutes a strong enhancer. Placental enhancers have been identified for the chorionic somatomammotropin-B (45Jacquemin P. Oury C. Peers B. Morin A. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 93-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and glycoprotein hormone α-subunit (48Jameson J.L. Jaffe R.C. Deutsch P.J. Albanese C. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31650-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), GATA (39Steger D.J. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 93-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), among others) implicated in transcription of these and other placental genes, suggesting that the protein binding to the PLE3 motif is a novel, placenta-specific transcription factor. Verification will require cloning of the transcription factor and analysis of its expression pattern. The enhancer is located within a MER11 (medium reiteration frequency repeat) element (28Gong D.W. Bi S. Pratley R.E. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3971-3974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). MER11 elements (which can be at least 1100 bp in length) are found 1500–3000 times in the human genome, but are not present in the murine genome (49Kaplan D.J. Jurka J. Solus J.F. Duncan C.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4731-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This observation provides an explanation of why the human, but not the murine, placenta expresses leptin mRNA. The MER11 insertion introduced DNA elements in a configuration that allowed interaction with the leptin promoter. (This hypothesis can be tested using phylogenetic analysis, scoring placental leptin expression, and the presence of the upstream MER11. Since the MER11 upstream of the leptin gene is only 94% identical to a consensus MER11, it is likely that the insertion event occurred at least several million years ago.) The high degree of sequence similarity between the leptin enhancer and other MER11s suggests that the other MER11s have the potential to be placental enhancers but require an accessible, compatible promoter for realization of this function. For example, 1.2 kb upstream of the human P450C17 gene (50Picado-Leonard J. Miller W.L. DNA. 1987; 6: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) is a MER11 that matches the leptin PLE1–3 motifs exactly, yet the P450C17gene is not expressed in the placenta (51Voutilainen R. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 63: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Insertion of repetitive elements in germline DNA is one of the major forces in evolution. Presumably, most insertions do not affect gene expression although sometimes insertion will disrupt a gene (52Kazazian Jr., H.H. Wong C. Youssoufian H. Scott A.F. Phillips D.G. Antonarakis S.E. Nature. 1988; 332: 164-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Least commonly, introduction of a repetitive element results in a gain of function (53Schulte A.M. Lai S. Kurtz A. Czubayko F. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14759-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) as apparently is the case with the human leptin enhancer. Thus, human placental production of leptin appears to be an example of evolution in action; ectopic expression of a gene is acquired coincidentally and then is available for integration into the physiology of the tissue. The biology of leptin during gestation is not well understood. In humans, the serum leptin concentration is increased 1.7-fold at the end of pregnancy (corrected for fat mass; Ref. 54Butte N.F. Hopkinson J.M. Nicolson M.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Placental production is a likely explanation for this increase although increased synthesis by maternal adipose tissue is also possible. One might have expected that a low leptin would be found during gestation since the metabolic effects of high leptin levels are not observed (decreased food intake) or would be undesirable (decreased metabolic efficiency) when the mother is putting great effort into nutrition of the fetus and into preparation for lactation. There is no information on either the bioactivity/bioavailability of leptin, or on the responsiveness of the body to leptin during pregnancy. If pregnancy is indeed a state of leptin resistance, then the observed increase in leptin could be a compensatory response. Alternatively, the increase in leptin levels might be selectively important for the reproductive system, rather than for general energy metabolism. Some information about the role of leptin in pregnancy comes from studies using the ob/ob mouse. Leptin is needed for reproductive system maturation and fertility (11Chehab F.F. Lim M.E. Lu R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 14Ahima R.S. Dushay J. Flier S.N. Prabakaran D. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) although this requirement can be bypassed and pregnancy induced (inefficiently) by gonadotropin treatment (10Smithberg M. Runner M.N. J. Hered. 1957; 48: 97-100Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ongoing leptin treatment is not necessary to maintain pregnancy, but leptin appears to be needed for parturition and nursing (11Chehab F.F. Lim M.E. Lu R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar).1 However, comparison between humans and mice is not straightforward. In humans, the serum leptin concentration is increased 1.7-fold (54Butte N.F. Hopkinson J.M. Nicolson M.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) compared with 20-fold in mice.1In mice there is also an increase in expression of a high-affinity binding protein, which has not been observed in humans.1While the increase in leptin during pregnancy in humans may be a random evolutionary event without functional significance, another possibility is that, in humans, placental leptin has a paracrine function, for example preparing the uterus for parturition. This hypothesis has the advantage of unifying the need for leptin during parturition in the mouse, with the apparent attenuation of its systemic metabolic effects. In summary, we have identified an enhancer of the human leptin gene and a placenta-selective element within the enhancer. This enhancer mediates placental expression of leptin, which could explain the increased leptin levels during human pregnancy. The biologic functions of leptin in gestation are not known, but a role in the control of pregnancy, parturition, or establishment of the lactating state seems likely and merits further investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2312647513,"HER2/Neu is overexpressed in 25 – 30% of all human breast cancers as a result of both gene amplification and enhanced transcription. Transcriptional upregulation of HER2/neu leads to a 6 – 8-fold increased abundance of its mRNA per gene copy and likely results from the elevated activity of transcription factors acting on the HER2/neu promoter. Here we report that transcripts of PEA3, an ETS transcription factor implicated in oncogenesis, were increased in 93% of HER2/Neu-overexpressing human breast tumor samples. Analyses to uncover the molecular basis for elevated PEA3 transcripts in HER2/Neu-positive breast tumors revealed that the HER2/Neu receptor tyrosine kinase initiated an intracellular signaling cascade resulting in increased PEA3 transcriptional activity; transcriptionally-activated PEA3 stimulated HER2/neu and PEA3 gene transcription by binding to sites in the promoters of these genes. PEA3 also activates transcription of genes encoding matrix-degrading proteinases, enzymes required for tumor cell migration and invasion. These findings implicate PEA3 in the initiation and progression of HER2/Neu positive breast cancer, and suggest that PEA3 and signaling proteins affecting its regulation are appropriate therapeutic targets."

Gene targeting was used to generate a mouse with a null mutation in the SERCA3 gene. Homozygous mutant mice were viable, fertile, and did not exhibit an overt disease phenotype. Because SERCA3 is expressed in arterial endothelial cells, aortic ring preparations were analyzed to determine whether it is involved in the regulation of vascular tone. Contraction-isometric force relations in response to phenylephrine or KCl, as well as relaxation produced by exposure to a nitric oxide donor, were similar in wild-type and null mutant aortas. Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortas after precontraction with phenylephrine was significantly reduced in homozygous mutants (61.3 ± 5.6% in wild type, 35.4 ± 7.3% in mutants). Ca2+ imaging of cultured aortic endothelial cells demonstrated that the acetylcholine-induced intracellular Ca2+ signal is sharply diminished in SERCA3-deficient cells and also indicated that replenishment of the acetylcholine-responsive Ca2+ stores is severely impaired.

Rep. 1995; 15: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SERCA pumps are encoded by three distinct genes and belong to the P-type superfamily of ion transport ATPases (reviewed in Ref. 4Missiaen L. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Declerck I. Casteels R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 50: 191-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). SERCA1 is restricted to fast-twitch skeletal muscle (5Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B.

By clearing Ca2+ from the cytosol, these sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps mediate muscle relaxation and replenish Ca2+ stores needed for excitation/contraction coupling. Non-muscle tissues contain thapsigargin-sensitive (9Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 269: C775-C784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that perform functions analogous to those of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps in that they control cytosolic Ca2+ levels and sequester Ca2+ in organelles from which it can be released by various agonists (4Missiaen L.

These include both SERCA3 and the ubiquitous SERCA2b, an alternatively spliced C-terminal variant of the SERCA2 gene (11Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15024-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gunteski-Hamblin A.M. Greeb J. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

SERCA2b is also the major intracellular Ca2+ pump of most smooth muscles (14Lytton J. Zarain-Herzberg A. Periasamy M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue distribution and cell-type specificity of SERCA3, unlike that of SERCA2b, is quite limited (1Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wu K.-D. Lee W.-S. Wey J. Bungard D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C775-C784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is expressed in endothelial cells, in epithelial cells of trachea, intestine, and salivary glands, and in platelets, mast cells, and lymphocytes (10Wu K.-D. Lee W.-S. Wey J. Bungard D. Lytton J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15771-15776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Each of the cell types in which SERCA3 is expressed also contains SERCA2b. In salivary gland acinar and duct cells, SERCA3 is localized at the basal pole, whereas SERCA2b is localized at the luminal pole (18Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15771-15776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). SERCA3 has a lower Ca2+ affinity, a higher sensitivity to vanadate, and a higher pH optimum than SERCA2b (19Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unusual biochemical characteristics and restricted cell-type distribution of SERCA3, and the prominence of Ca2+signaling in the cell types in which it is expressed, suggest that it might play a role in specialized signaling functions, such as those involved in the regulation of vascular tone (15Anger M. Samuel J.-L. Marotte F. Wuytack F. Rappaport L. Lompre A.-M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Anger M. Samuel J.-L. Marotte F. Wuytack F. Rappaport L. Lompre A.-M. J. Mol. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 539-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we prepared a SERCA3-deficient mouse and analyzed contraction and relaxation of aortic ring preparations, as well as Ca2+ signaling in aortic endothelial cells. The results suggest that SERCA3 plays an important role in the Ca2+signaling mechanisms that mediate endothelium-dependent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. A λ phage clone containing part of the mouse SERCA3 gene was isolated from a strain 129/SvJ genomic library and partially characterized by restriction mapping, Southern blot hybridization, and DNA sequence analysis. The region analyzed included exons that correspond to exons 3–9 of the rabbit SERCA1 gene (20Korczak B. Zarain-Herzberg A. Brandl C.J. Ingles C.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4813-4819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which encode amino acids 46–365. In over 250 codons sequenced, only a single conservative amino acid substitution was observed in the mouse sequence relative to that of rat SERCA3, thereby confirming the identity of the gene. The targeting vector, pMJKO (a gift of Dr. Steven Potter), contained both the neomycin resistance gene and HSV-tk gene. Digestion of the SERCA3 genomic clone with BamHI yielded a 2-kb fragment extending from aBamHI site in intron 2 to a BamHI site at codon 139 in exon 5 and a 3-kb fragment extending from the BamHI site in exon 5 to a BamHI site at codon 286 in exon 8. The 2-kb fragment was blunt-end ligated into a blunt-ended XhoI site in the vector between the 3′-end of the neo gene and the 5′-end of HSV-tk gene, and the 3-kb fragment was ligated into a BamHI site in the vector immediately 5′ of the neo gene. The construct was linearized at a NotI site in the vector and transfected by electroporation into ES cells. 1 day after electroporation, cells were exposed to G418 at 450 μg/ml, and the concentration was reduced to 250 μg/ml 24 h later to select cells containing the neo gene. After 2 days, 2 μmgancyclovir was added to the medium and continued for 3 days to select cells lacking the HSV-tk gene. Clones resistant to both drugs were picked and expanded 10 days after electroporation. DNA from G418- and gancyclovir-resistant ES cells was digested with EcoRI and analyzed by Southern hybridization using a 530-bp BamHI fragment from the region 3′ to the fragments used to prepare the construct. Homologous recombination was verified by Southern blot analysis of HindIII-digested DNA using a probe spanning the region from exon 4 through exon 5. Three ES cell lines containing the disrupted SERCA3 gene were used for blastocyst-mediated transgenesis. The resulting chimeric mice were mated to Black Swiss mice, and tail DNA from offspring with the ES cell-derived agouti coat color were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. Total RNA was isolated from various tissues using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), denatured in glyoxal, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Hybridization with32P-labeled probes and washes were performed by the method of Church and Gilbert (21Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar). The SERCA3 probe was a PCR fragment that spanned nucleotides 2773–3385 of the rat SERCA3 cDNA (1Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse eNOS probe was prepared by RT-PCR of mouse lung RNA using primers from human (22Janssens S.P. Shimouchi A. Quertermous T. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14519-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bovine (23Sessa W.C. Harrison J.K. Barber C.M. Zeng D. Durieux M.E. D'Angelo D.D. Lynch K.R. Peach M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15274-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) eNOS cDNAs (5′-GGC ATC ACC AGG AAG AAG AC-3′, corresponding to bovine codons 491–497; 5′-CG CCA AGA GGA CAC CAG T-3′, complementary to bovine codons 623–629). Equivalent loading of RNA was confirmed by hybridization with a mouse β-actin probe. First strand cDNA was prepared using 1–4 μg of total RNA from mutant or wild-type lung, colon, and heart, oligo(dT) primers, and Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primers for PCR amplification of cDNA were from the 5′-end of exon 4 (corresponding to codons 77–83) and from the 3′-end of exon 6 (complementary to codons 175–181). PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and then isolated, subcloned, and sequenced. A pBluescript subclone (24Toyofuko T. Kurzydlowski K. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the rat SERCA3 cDNA (1Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to prepare the mutant SERCA3 coding sequence. A fragment with a deletion of codons 127–154 was generated by PCR using the T7 primer and a primer, 5′-C AGC AGG TAC CTT GTC TCC CAC CAT CTC AGG CTC ATA CTC C-3′, complementary to sequences beginning in codon 120 and ending in codon 162 but lacking codons 127–154. Since the amplified fragment included a SmaI site at codon 33 and a KpnI site at codon 159 that was located just 3′ to the deletion, aSmaI-KpnI fragment was removed from it and used to replace the corresponding region of the wild-type sequence in the pBluescript subclone. The coding region was inserted into the pMT2 expression vector (a generous gift from Dr. R. J. Kaufman), which was used for expression of both wild-type and mutant rat SERCA3 cDNAs. The methods used for transfection of HEK-293 cells, isolation of microsomes 48–72 h after transfection, and analysis of Ca2+ uptake into microsomal vesicles were the same as those described previously (25Toyofuko T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed using total RNA isolated from transfected cells and a rat SERCA3 cDNA (1Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) probe. Western blot analysis of microsomes and whole cell lysates from transfected cells was performed as described previously (1Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the polyclonal antibody C4 directed against an N-terminal fragment of rabbit SERCA2. For the histology survey, brain, heart, lung, trachea, liver, spleen, kidney, stomach, large intestine, thymus, thyroid, pituitary, salivary gland, and quadriceps muscle were taken from two 7-week-old and three 3-month-old SERCA3 −/− andSERCA3 +/+ mice, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and analyzed by light microscopy. Aortas were dissected from ten SERCA3 −/− and sixSERCA3 +/+ mice, ranging in age from 8 weeks to 10 months, after perfusion fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The aortas were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in Spurr's resin. 1-micron-thick cross-sections of the aorta were stained with toluidine blue for light microscopy or stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for examination of endothelial cells by electron microscopy. Morphometric measurements were obtained at the following magnifications: aortic diameter (smallest diameter), 80×; aortic wall (tunica media) thickness and adventitial thickness, 500×; and number of endothelial cells and smooth muscle nuclei over a distance of 1500 μm, 1250×. The data were analyzed using the general linear model of statistical analysis systems. Force measurements were carried out as described previously (26Lalli J. Harrer J.M. Luo W. Kranias E.G. Paul R.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Segments of thoracic aorta, 5 mm in length, from 11–16-week-oldSERCA3 +/+ and SERCA3 −/−sibling mice were mounted on stainless steel wires, placed in a bath of bicarbonate-buffered physiological saline (118 mm NaCl, 4.73 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.026 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, and 25 mm NaH2CO3; pH when bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 was 7.4 at 37 °C), and connected to a Harvard apparatus differential capacitor force transducer. In experiments requiring de-endothelialized vessels, the endothelium was removed by gently rubbing the ring between the thumb and forefinger. For each aorta, resting tension was set to 25–30 mN to approximate an in vivo pressure of 100 mm Hg. Data were recorded using BIOPAC digital acquisition and analyzed using AcqKnowledge Software, and results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Concentration-response curves were generated to the contractile agents KCl and phenylephrine. Following precontraction with 2–5 μm phenylephrine, which yielded 80–90% maximum contraction, relaxation curves were generated in response to ACh and the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside. Percent relaxation was calculated based on the sustained phase of relaxation. Statistical analyses were performed by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance using Sigma Stat software (Jandel Scientific). Blood pressure was recorded in unanesthetized adult SERCA3 +/+ andSERCA3 −/− mice (n = 5 for each genotype) by the tail-cuff procedure described by Krege et al. (27Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Smithies O. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) using a Visitech Systems (Apex, North Carolina) computerized tail-cuff apparatus. After a 5-day training period to allow the mice to become accustomed to the device, daily blood pressure measurements were recorded over a period of 14 days. Intra-arterial blood pressure measurements in adult mice (fiveSERCA3 +/+ and fourSERCA3 −/−) were obtained by catheterization of the femoral artery under inactin anesthesia as described previously (28Lorenz J. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1137-H1146PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were isolated from adultSERCA3 +/+ and SERCA3 −/−aortas by collagenase digestion, essentially as described earlier (29Jarrell B. Levine E. Shapiro S. Williams S.K. Carabasi R.A. Mueller S. Thornton S. J. Vasc. Surg. 1984; 1: 757-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The descending thoracic aorta was placed into PBS containing 0.1% BSA, blood was flushed from the vessel, and each end was ligated with 5-0 silk suture. A solution of PBS containing 8 mg/ml collagenase B (Boehringer Mannheim) and 8 mg/ml BSA (eFAF grade, Sigma) was injected into the ligated vessel. The vessel was incubated at 37 °C in BSA/PBS for 40 min. The ligated ends were then removed, the vessel was opened longitudinally, and loosely adhered cells were dislodged by repeated flushing with a pipette. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium containing 1 mg/ml glucose and 0.1% BSA, and plated onto glass coverslips coated with fibronectin. After 18 h at 37 °C, sheets of 4–20 endothelial cells had adhered and spread. To confirm that these sheets were composed of endothelial cells, separate coverslips were incubated with 10 μg/ml 1,1“-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate-acetylated low density lipoprotein (Biomedical Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA) for 4 h at 37 °C and then counterstained with 5 μg/ml bis-benzamide to identify individual cells. Greater than 98% of the isolated cells were determined to be endothelial cells by their accumulation of the 1,1”-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate-acetylated low density lipoprotein fluorescent probe in intracellular membranes (30Danthuluri N.R. Cybulsky M.I. Brock T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: H1549-H1553PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslips containing sheets of endothelial cells cultured for 18 h or less were washed and loaded for 60 min at 37 °C with 2 mm fura-2 AM with 0.04% pluronic acid in Ca2+ imaging buffer (140 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) (31Voyta J.C. Via D.P. Butterfield C.E. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2034-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. Cells from four SERCA3 +/+ and threeSERCA3 −/− mice were imaged. Loaded cells were washed with fluorochrome-free Ca2+ imaging buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow hydrolysis of the fura-2 AM. Intracellular Ca2+ responses for individual cells were analyzed using a Ca2+ imaging system (Intracellular Imaging, Inc., Cincinnati OH) interfaced with an inverted microscope fitted with a Peltier temperature-controlled stage. The experiments were performed at 33 °C in Ca2+ imaging buffer. Endothelial cells were stimulated by adding an equal volume of a 2 × ACh solution in Ca2+ imaging buffer. After 100 s, ACh was washed out of the chamber to permit recovery of intracellular Ca2+ stores, and ACh was again added. At the end of each experiment, the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, was added to a final concentration of 10 μm to determine the maximum Ca2+ response. The results for multiple cells are reported as mean ± S.E. For statistical analysis, a single between factor or mixed two-factor analysis of variance was performed first. If the test of normality or equal variance within the test populations failed, a nonparametric Mean-Whitney rank sum test was performed, and the p value reported represents the significance of the differences in median values observed. The targeting construct (Fig.1) contained 5.0 kb of genomic sequence, with the neo gene disrupting exon 5, which encodes amino acids 109–154. After electroporation of ES cells, 168 colonies survived positive-negative selection in G418 and gancyclovir. Southern blot analysis using a 3′-outside probe revealed that eight clones contained the unique 3.9-kb EcoRI fragment that was diagnostic of a targeted allele (left panel of Fig. 1 B), and homologous recombination was confirmed by the presence of a 6.0-kbHindIII fragment that hybridized with an internal probe (middle panel of Fig. 1 B). Blastocyst-mediated transgenesis yielded 14 male chimeric mice. These animals were bred with wild-type females, and Southern blot analysis of tail DNA samples from offspring with the ES cell-derived agouti coat color led to the identification of animals carrying the targeted allele. Matings of heterozygous animals produced wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant offspring, as demonstrated by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA (right panel of Fig. 1 B). Genotype analysis of 239 offspring of heterozygous matings yielded 69 (28.8%) wild-type, 114 (47.7%) heterozygous, and 56 (23.4%) homozygous mutant mice, which is almost identical to the normal 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio. Heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice seemed normal with respect to viability and growth and were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates in their gross appearance and behavior. Homozygous mutant male and female mice were fertile, and matings of homozygotes resulted in live births of healthy offspring. Northern blot analysis of RNA from colon and lung of mice of all three genotypes and from aorta of wild-type and homozygous mutant mice revealed the presence of an mRNA in SERCA3 −/− tissues that was slightly smaller in size than the wild-type mRNA (Fig.2 A). The levels of the mutant mRNA were sharply reduced in SERCA3 −/−colon and lung, relative to wild-type levels, but were not reduced inSERCA3 −/− aorta. The basis for the slight difference in size between the mutant and wild-type mRNAs was determined by RT-PCR analysis. The sizes of the PCR products corresponding to the wild-type and mutant mRNAs were 314 and 230 bp, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Sequence analysis revealed that the last 84 nucleotides of exon 5 were excised from the mutant mRNA by the splicing of a cryptic donor site in exon 5 to the acceptor site of exon 6 (Fig. 2 C). The mutant mRNA had a 28-codon deletion corresponding to amino acids 127–154, but the open reading frame was intact. To determine whether the mutant SERCA3 was capable of mediating Ca2+transport, the deletion mutant and wild-type SERCA3 were expressed transiently in HEK-293 cells, and Ca2+ uptake activity was analyzed. A high level of Ca2+ uptake was observed in microsomes from cells transfected with the wild-type construct, but only background levels of Ca2+ uptake occurred in microsomes from cells transfected with the mutant construct (Fig.3). Northern blot analysis showed that SERCA3 mRNA was expressed at high levels in HEK-293 cells transfected with either the wild-type or mutant construct (upper inset panel of Fig. 3). Western blot analysis demonstrated that microsomes from cells expressing the wild-type SERCA3 mRNA contained high levels of the protein, but only the endogenous SERCA pump (presumably SERCA2b) was detected in microsomes from nontransfected cells and from cells expressing the mutant SERCA3 mRNA (lower inset panel of Fig. 3). Trace levels of an immunoreactive protein that was slightly smaller than the wild-type pump was detected in whole cell extracts of cells transfected with the mutant construct but not in extracts of control cells (data not shown), suggesting that the mutant SERCA3 is synthesized but is unstable and is not incorporated into microsomal membranes. A survey of multiple organs revealed no obvious histopathology inSERCA3 −/− mice at 7 weeks and 3 months of age. While performing experiments with aortic rings, we identified a 14-week-old SERCA3 −/− mouse in which the aorta was stiff. Histological analysis revealed necrosis of the tunica media; however, in additional samples, this defect was not observed. Morphometric analysis of SERCA3 +/+ andSERCA3 −/− aortas from mice ranging in age from 8 weeks to 10 months revealed no significant differences in numbers (per 150 μm of basement membrane) of endothelial cells (SERCA3 −/−, 4.84 ± 0.28;SERCA3 +/+, 4.80 ± 0.50) or smooth muscle cells (SERCA3 −/−, 15.72 ± 1.24;SERCA3 +/+, 15.65 ± 1.93). There were also no significant differences in the diameter of the aorta (SERCA3 −/−, 442.8 ± 16.9 μm;SERCA3 +/+, 484.8 ± 26.4 μm), thickness of the aortic wall (SERCA3 −/−, 36.1 ± 1.6 μm; SERCA3 +/+, 36.5 ± 1.9 μm), or thickness of the adventitia (SERCA3 −/−, 20.6 ± 2.8 μm; SERCA3 +/+, 17.6 ± 2.0 μm). Electron microscopy revealed no apparent differences in endothelial cells of SERCA3 +/+ andSERCA3 −/− mice. Because SERCA3 is expressed in arterial endothelial cells (15Anger M. Samuel J.-L. Marotte F. Wuytack F. Rappaport L. Lompre A.-M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Anger M. Samuel J.-L. Marotte F. Wuytack F. Rappaport L. Lompre A.-M. J. Mol.

To test this hypothesis, we first examined contractility of aortic rings from sibling SERCA3 +/+ andSERCA3 −/− mice. In our initial experiments, concentration-isometric force relations were determined for phenylephrine and KCl. When exposed to either contractile agent,SERCA3 +/+ and SERCA3 −/−aortas yielded similar dose-response curves (Fig.4). Although there was a trend toward greater sensitivity in the mutant aortas, the differences were not statistically significant. Exposure ofSERCA3 −/− and SERCA3 +/+aortas, both with and without endothelium, to concentrations of phenylephrine and KCl that yield maximum contraction revealed no significant differences in maximum force per unit area (TableI).Table IMaximal contractile force of isolated aortic rings from wild-type and SERCA3 homozygous mutant micePEKCl+endo−endo+endo−endoWild type31.6 ± 4.138.9 ± 6.030.8 ± 2.528.4 ± 4.0Mutant33.5 ± 5.631.3 ± 2.631.7 ± 3.724.7 ± 3.9Aortas with intact endothelium (+endo, n = 10) or without endothelium (−endo,"
https://openalex.org/W2330015980,"Examination of a panel of ER positive breast cancer cell lines showed that they were differentially growth inhibited by vitamin D3 and its analogue EB1089. EB1089 treatment of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 E, BT20, T47D, and ZR75 demonstrated a correlation between a reduction in Cdk2 kinase activity towards phosphorylation of histone H1 and a decrease in DNA synthesis, while no modulation of Cdk2 activity was observed in the vitamin D3 and EB1089 resistant cell line MCF-7 L. This was accompanied by a time dependent decrease in the percentage of S phase cells in the responsive lines. Characterization of the expression levels of Cdk2 and its related cell cycle proteins in MCF-7 E cells showed that after EB1089 treatment, there was a concentration and time dependent up-regulation of p21 as well as a decrease in cyclin A proteins. Paradoxically, cyclin E levels were increased as a function of treatment. Analysis of cyclin-Cdk2-Cdki complex formation showed that in EB1089 treated MCF-7 E cells, Cdk2, cyclin A and cyclin E immunoprecipitates contained an increased abundance of p21. In contrast to MCF-7 E cells, increases in both p21 and p27 as well as their complex formation with Cdk2 were observed in BT20 and ZR75 cells. These findings indicate that up-regulation of p21 as well as p27 in some cell types may account for the inactivation of Cdk2 activity and a G1 block of the cell cycle following EB1089 treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2063824048,"Chromosome 11q13 is amplified in about 13% of primary breast cancers. CCND1, encoding the cell cycle regulatory gene cyclin D1, and EMS1, encoding a filamentous actin binding protein, are favoured candidate onocogenes, whereas INT-2 is an unexpressed gene at this locus. In this study we tested the possibility that different regions of this large amplicon could be independently amplified and subsequently defined the phenotype of EMS1 amplified tumours in a series of 961 primary breast carcinomas. Using DNA slot blots, EMS1 was amplified in 15.2% of samples: 5.4% were coamplified for CCND1; 7.9% coamplified for INT-2 and 6.7% showed EMS1 amplification alone. The degree of amplification of CCND1 and INT-2 was highly correlated (P=0.0001). In contrast, no such relationship existed between EMS1 and CCND1 or INT-2 amplification, demonstrating independent amplification of EMS1 in 44% of amplified tumours. EMS1 amplification (⩾twofold increase in copy number) was positively correlated with patient age ⩾50 years (P=0.025), ER positivity (P=0.022), PgR positivity (P=0.018), and was negatively correlated with HER-2/neu (c-erbB2) amplification (P=0.01). In common with CCND1/INT-2, EMS1 amplification was associated with increased risk of relapse in patients with lymph node-negative disease (P=0.028). In contrast, EMS1 and CCND1/INT-2 amplification appeared to confer different phenotypes in ER positive and negative tumours. A ⩾threefold increase in EMS1 copy number was associated with an apparent increased risk of relapse and death in patients with ER negative tumours, but was without effect in ER positive tumours. In contrast, CCND1/INT-2 amplification had no effect in the patients with ER negative tumours but was associated with early relapse in ER positive patients. Thus EMS1 amplification may identify subgroups of breast cancer patients with increased probability of relapse and death distinct from those identified by CCND1/INT-2 amplification. Further studies are required to more clearly determine the functional consequences of EMS1 overexpression and a biological basis for the relationship between EMS1 amplification and phenotype in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2089191180,"Tetanus toxin entry into vertebrate motorneurons may involve binding of neuronal surface gangliosides containing the “1b” substructure (a NeuAcα2,8NeuAc group on an internal galactose residue). The domains of tetanus toxin involved in ganglioside binding are known to reside within the carboxyl-terminal half of the toxin's heavy chain (“C fragment”). We developed a novel photoaffinity reagent based upon the structure of the 1b ganglioside GD1b(125I-azido-GD1b) to define the ganglioside-binding domains of tetanus toxin. Using this ligand, we observed radiolabeling of tetanus toxin C fragment which could be specifically inhibited by a ganglioside of the 1b series (GT1b), but not by a non-1b series ganglioside (GM3). When tetanus toxin C fragment was proteolyzed with clostripain, whether before or after reaction with125I-azido-GD1b, a radiolabeled band was observed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis autoradiography, which was selectively inhibited by GT1b. Protein sequencing of proteolyzed tetanus toxin C fragment co-migrating with that band revealed the carboxyl-terminal 34 amino acid residues of tetanus toxin. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of a photoaffinity labeled synthetic polypeptide representing the 34-amino acid domain revealed modification at a single residue (His1293).

We propose that this domain of tetanus toxin is sufficient for ganglioside binding. The major Clostridial neurotoxins, botulinum and tetanus toxins, are a family of homologous proteins with selective toxicity for vertebrate motorneurons (1Niemann H. Alouf J.E. Freer J. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 303-348Google Scholar). Their neurotropism is a long studied phenomenon (for an excellent historical review and primary historical references, see Niemann (1Niemann H. Alouf J.E. Freer J. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 303-348Google Scholar)). These toxins are believed to gain neural entry by recognition of specific binding sites on motorneuronal axonal processes, followed by endocytosis, intracellular transport, and targeting of the toxins to sites of action. The motorneuron membrane structures responsible for reception ofClostridial toxins have not been definitively established. However, a wealth of data implicate cell surface glycolipids as toxin-binding sites (2Habermann E. Dreyer F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 129: 93-179PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies demonstrated that a crude preparation of mixed brain gangliosides, glycosphingolipids containing anionic sialic acid (NeuAc) carbohydrate residues, could “fix” tetanus toxin in vitro (3van Heyningen S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1980; 11: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4Wellhoner H.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Exp. Pharmacol. 1982; 93: 1-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, purified gangliosides containing the “1b” substructure (a NeuAcα2,8NeuAc group on an internal galactose residue) were shown to directly support toxin binding, and to inhibit toxin binding to brain membranes (5Rogers T.B.

Acta. 1993; 1156: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)), ganglioside binding is supported by the isolated carboxyl-terminal half (≈50 kDa) of the respective heavy chains. This region of tetanus toxin is commonly termed the “C fragment” and roughly comprises amino acids 864–1315 (1Niemann H. Alouf J.E. Freer J. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 303-348Google Scholar).Recently, in a highly informative study, Halpern and Loftus (22Halpern J.L. Loftus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11188-11192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) synthesized various peptide fragments near the carboxyl terminus of tetanus toxin and measured their binding to immobilized GT1b ganglioside and neurons at physiological pH and ionic strength. Their data indicated that ganglioside binding is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal portion of the tetanus toxin C fragment, although contributions of protein secondary and tertiary structure to binding (e.g. interactions of non-contiguous polypeptide sequences) may be significant.To extend this analysis, we developed a novel ganglioside-based photoaffinity ligand to identify polypeptide domains of tetanus toxin involved in binding to 1b series gangliosides. A radioiodinated aryl azide derivative of GD1b ganglioside (125I-azido-GD1b) was synthesized, incubated with tetanus toxin C fragment in solution, and then the reaction was photolyzed, thereby covalently fixing the ligand at the toxin's presumptive ganglioside-binding site(s). The photoaffinity-labeled tetanus toxin C fragment was then enzymatically proteolyzed and the resultant radiolabeled peptides purified and sequenced. An advantage of azido-GD1b photoaffinity labeling is that ganglioside binding may be performed prior to toxin fragmentation, while the protein is in its native conformation. Using this technique we identify the 34-amino acid peptide at the carboxyl terminus of tetanus toxin as sufficient for ganglioside binding, and demonstrate specific photoaffinity labeling at His1293.RESULTSIncubation of tetanus toxin C fragment with125I-azido-GD1b, followed by photoflash activation, produced radiolabeling of a polypeptide band which co-migrated with the tetanus toxin C fragment (Fig.3 A). When tetanus toxin C fragment was preincubated with ganglioside GT1b prior to reaction with 125I-azido-GD1b, radiolabeling was inhibited (Fig. 3 B). Half-maximal inhibition of125I-azido-GD1b labeling of tetanus toxin C fragment occurred at ≈1 μm GT1b. Preincubation of tetanus toxin C fragment with ganglioside GM3 to a concentration of 50 μm was without significant effect on subsequent radiolabeling (Fig. 3 B), whereas preincubation with ganglioside GM1 resulted in half-maximal inhibition at approximately 10 μm (data not shown), consistent with previously published inhibition studies (5Rogers T.B. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2402-2407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Tetanus toxin C fragment (1 μg/reaction) was preincubated (without inhibitor or with 10 μm of either GT1b or GM3), reacted with 125I-azido-GD1b, and proteolyzed with clostripain, and the polypeptides subjected to Tricine SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A). Alternately, tetanus toxin C fragment was first proteolyzed with clostripain, then the mixture of fragments preincubated with inhibitors (as indicated) and photoaffinity labeled with125I-azido-GD1b (Fig. 4 B). Autoradiographic analysis of these reactions after Tricine SDS-PAGE demonstrated only one band for which radiolabeling was selectively inhibited by GT1b, regardless of whether the tetanus toxin C fragment was proteolyzed before or after reaction with125I-azido-GD1b. This band co-migrated with a polypeptide fragment detected by Coomassie Blue staining of unlabeled proteolyzed tetanus toxin C fragment electrophoresed in an adjacent lane (not shown). In the sample which was first photoaffinity labeled, then proteolyzed, this appeared to be the only radiolabeled polypeptide fragment, in that other radiolabeled bands were lipid-related (they appeared in control reactions in which tetanus toxin C fragment was excluded, data not shown). These results suggest that a peptide fragment of tetanus toxin binds to125I-azido-GD1b in a manner that is selectively inhibitable by 1b series gangliosides (GT1b). The observation that a comparable pattern of labeling was observed whether the 125I-azido-GD1b reaction was performed before or after proteolysis indicates that the labeled peptide is sufficient to mediate ganglioside binding (see below). Furthermore, the observation that quantitatively greater labeling of comparable amounts of tetanus toxin C fragment occurred if the125I-azido-GD1b reaction followed proteolysis (Table I) suggests that other domains of the polypeptide may attenuate ganglioside binding.Figure 4Proteolysis of tetanus toxin C fragment before or after 125I-azido-GD1b labeling.Intact (A) or clostripain-proteolyzed (B) tetanus toxin C fragment (1 μg/reaction) was photoaffinity labeled with125I-azido-GD1b in the absence of ganglioside inhibitors (lanes 1), or in the presence of 10 μm GT1b (lanes 2) or GM3 (lanes 3). Radiolabeled intact tetanus toxin C fragment was subsequently digested with clostripain. The reactions were resolved by Tricine SDS-PAGE and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. The migration position of a unique clostripain proteolytic product of tetanus toxin C fragment (resolved in adjacent lanes, not shown) is indicated with arrows. The adjacent proteolytic fragment was subsequently isolated and sequenced (see text). In the reactions containing GT1b (lanes 2), the radiolabeled band which migrates just slower than the proteolytic fragment is an artifact of 125I-azido-GD1breaction with GT1b, since it appeared in all reactions containing GT1b, including those in which the toxin fragment was omitted (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table I125I-Azido-GD1b photoaffinity labeling of tetanus toxin C fragment before and after proteolysisInhibitorRadiolabel co-migrating with tetanus toxin carboxyl-terminal polypeptideLabeled then proteolyzedProteolyzed then labeledrelative units (%of control)None28.4 (100)169 (100)GT1b 0 (0)49 (29)GM354.3 (191)197 (116)Intact or clostripain-proteolyzed tetanus toxin C fragment (1 μg/reaction) was photoaffinity labeled with125I-azido-GD1b in the presence or absence of the indicated ganglioside inhibitors (10 μm).

Following electrophoresis, the gel was sliced in half. The side containing radiolabeled tetanus fragments was analyzed by autoradiography, whereas the side containing the lanes of unlabeled tetanus fragments was subjected to electrotransfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Based upon the mobility of the GT1b-inhibitable radiolabeled band, a rectangle of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was excised from the lane containing proteolyzed unlabeled tetanus toxin C fragment and subjected to microsequencing. The results indicated a peptide with amino-terminal sequence DILIASNXYFNHLKDKILG (where X represents no determination). This sequence corresponds to the amino acids following the clostripain cleavage site closest to the carboxyl terminus of tetanus toxin (Fig. 5). Therefore the clostripain cleavage product of tetanus toxin C fragment which is labeled with125I-azido-GD1b in a GT1b-inhibitable manner is consistent with its identification as the carboxyl-terminal 34 amino acids of tetanus toxin: DILIASNWYFNHLKDKILGCDWYFVPTDEGWTND (Fig.5).Figure 5Sequence comparisons of the carboxyl termini of Clostridial toxins.

No comparable molecular species was detected if the same incubation was performed in the absence of azido-GD1b (data not shown).

Carboxypeptidase P treatment of the trypsin fragment confirmed this observation (Fig.8, Table II), in that sequentially cleaved derivatized fragments from 1–16 to 1–12 were detected, whereas only the underivatized fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–11 was found.

Moreover, this peptide is superior to the intact tetanus C fragment in supporting ganglioside binding, since there was greater125I-azido-GD1b labeling if proteolysis was performed prior to photoaffinity labeling. A synthetic polypeptide corresponding to these 34 amino acids was specifically photolabeled by azido-GD1b.These results agree with the findings of Halpern and Loftus (22Halpern J.L. Loftus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11188-11192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who reported structure-activity relationships for the binding of recombinant tetanus toxin fragments to neurons or to gangliosides at physiological pH and ionic strength. They found markedly enhanced binding of peptide 1120–1315 relative to peptide 858–1315, indicating not only that peptide 1120–1315 is sufficient to support both neuron and ganglioside binding, but that the presence of amino acids 858–1119 inhibits such binding. Whereas peptide 858–1310 supported binding to gangliosides and neurons, peptide 858–1305 did not. Although these studies indicate that amino acids 1306–1310 are required for binding, they may not bind directly to gangliosides, since peptide 1296–1315 neither bound to gangliosides nor blocked other peptides from binding, and a monoclonal antibody against peptide 1296–1315 bound to toxin-ganglioside complexes without inhibiting their interaction. In contrast, a monoclonal antibody recognizing an epitope in peptide 1236–1315 inhibited toxin-ganglioside binding and tetanus toxin-mediated toxicity (29Andersen-Beckh B. Binz T. Kurazono H. Mayer T. Eisel U. Niemann H. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3498-3505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that amino acids within 1236–1295 may be particularly critical for direct ganglioside binding. Our results indicate that the critical residues for ganglioside binding are included in the carboxyl-terminal peptide 1282–1315, and photoaffinity labeling occurred predominantly at residue 1293. The structurally unrelated enterotoxin from another Clostridialspecies (Clostridium perfringens) also encodes its cell binding function in its carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids (30Hanna P.C. Mietzner T.A. Schoolnik G.K. McClane B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11037-11043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The presence of a 34-amino acid peptide of tetanus toxin capable of independently supporting specific ganglioside binding suggests that there may be an oligosaccharide recognition domain shared among the 7 homologous Clostridial neurotoxins, all of which are known to possess some ganglioside binding activity. Alignment of the carboxyl-terminal sequences of the 6 botulinum toxins which are homologous to tetanus toxin (11Eisel U. Jarausch W. Goretzki K. Henschen A. Engels J. Weller U. Hudel M. Habermann E.

Lett. 1984; 211: 219-223Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), indicates the conservation of particular residues which may mediate carbohydrate recognition (Fig. 5). Those toxins which functionally interact the least with GT1b (e.g. botulinum Types C and D) are more divergent from tetanus toxin in their carboxyl-terminal sequence compared with those which are most inhibited by GT1b. The site of photoaffinity labeling (His1293) is near two lysine residues (Lys1295and Lys1297) which may bind the sialic acid carboxylate(s). Furthermore, tetanus toxin binding to neural membranes exhibits a pH maximum near the pK of histidine (pH 6, Ref. 6Morris N.P. Consiglio E. Kohn L.D. Habig W.H. Hardegree M.C. Helting T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6071-6076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enhanced binding at low pH may reflect protonation of His1293 near the sialic acid binding pocket. Botulinum toxins B, F, A, and E have one or more cationic amino acids at comparable positions on their carboxyl-terminal structures (Fig. 5).All of the above toxins are encoded episomally withinClostridial species (i.e. in phage or plasmid) (1Niemann H. Alouf J.E. Freer J. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 303-348Google Scholar). This fact raises the possibility that toxin sequences may have originally been found in vertebrate host genes, and then adopted by these bacteria. Consequently, definition of the amino acid sequences necessary for ganglioside recognition in Clostridial toxins may aid in identification of vertebrate proteins with similar carbohydrate binding functions.Tetanus toxin C fragment, while itself nontoxic, retains not only the ganglioside binding activity of native tetanus toxin, but also its selective cytologic mobility (e.g. motorneuronal retrograde axonal transport and subsequent retrograde transynaptic transfer), albeit with some loss of transport efficiency (18Bizzini B.

https://openalex.org/W1969301447,"Recent evidence suggests that arachidonic acid (AA) may be involved in regulating cellular proliferation. The predominant mechanism of AA release from cellular phospholipids is via phospholipase A2 (PLA2) hydrolysis. The purpose of this study was to examine the roles of the distinct 14-kDa and 85-kDa PLA2 enzymes in human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cell (hCAVSMC) proliferation. Cultured hCAVSMCs proliferate in the presence of growth medium with a typical doubling time of 30–40 h, grow at a slower proliferative rate upon reaching confluency (day 8), and eventually undergo contact inhibition of growth (day 10). Neither Type II 14-kDa PLA2activity nor mass changed over a 10-day culture period. In contrast, 85-kDa PLA2 protein activity and mRNA decreased as time in culture progressed. This reduction in 85-kDa PLA2correlated with reductions in DNA synthesis and suggested a possible association between 85-kDa PLA2 and proliferation. To directly evaluate the role of the 85-kDa PLA2 in proliferation we examined the effects of an 85-kDa PLA2inhibitor (AACOCF3) and 85-kDa PLA2 antisense oligonucleotides on proliferation. Both reagents dose dependently inhibited proliferation, whereas a 14-kDa PLA2 inhibitor (SB203347), a calcium-independent PLA2 inhibitor (HELSS), an 85-kDa sense oligonucleotide, and a nonrelevant scrambled control oligonucleotide had no effect. The mechanism by which 85-kDa PLA2 influences cellular proliferation remains unclear. Inhibition of 85-kDa PLA2 activity produced neither phase-specific cell cycle arrest nor apoptosis (fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis). Addition of AA (20 μm) attenuated the effects of both AACOCF3 and 85-kDa antisense oligonucleotides implicating AA as a key mediator in cellular proliferation. However, although prostaglandin E2(PGE2) was present in the culture medium, it peaked early (day 3) in culture, and indomethacin had no effect on cellular proliferation indicating that hCAVSMC proliferation was not mediated through PGE2. These data provide the first direct evidence that PLA2 is involved in control of VSMC proliferation and indicate that 85-kDa PLA2-mediated liberation of AA is critical for cellular proliferation."

To characterize the affinity and specificity of ER interaction with ERE sequencesin vitro under equilibrium conditions, fluorescence anisotropy assays were performed using recombinant, purified ER and a fluorescein-labeled 35-base pair oligonucleotide bearing an idealized palindromic ERE. In buffer containing 100 mm KCl, the baculovirus-expressed, purified human ER bound with similar affinity to the consensus ERE and a mutant ERE with a single base pair change per half-site. Above 225 mm KCl, ER exhibited discrimination between the consensus and mutated ERE targets. Between 225 and 275 mm KCl, binding to the consensus ERE was independent of salt concentration and occurred with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K d ) of 1.8 ± 0.6 nm, whereas binding to the mutant ERE was not detected at ER concentrations below 100 nm under the same conditions. At 300 mm KCl, the K d for the consensus ERE increased approximately 25-fold, suggesting complex salt concentration dependence. Both estrogen-occupied and unoccupied ER bound to the consensus ERE sequence with similar affinity, indicating that estrogen affects ER activity at a step other than DNA binding. Unlike the full-length ER, the recombinant DNA binding domain of ER did not discriminate between the consensus and mutated ERE sequences even at buffer salt concentrations greater than 200 mm NaCl, suggesting that ER sequences outside the DNA binding domain may be important in promoting specific binding.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5145-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), leading to the assembly of an active transcriptional complex responsible for the positive and negative regulation of target genes. One of the principal requirements for E2-induced regulation of target genes is the specific association of ER with the ERE. The ability of unpurified ER from rat uterine cytosolic extracts to discriminate the consensus ERE from other DNA sequences was examined by using an avidin-biotin complexed with DNA assay to quantify the binding interaction (17Murdoch F.E. Grunwald K.A.A. Gorski J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10838-10844Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These assays indicated that ER recognized the vitellogenin ERE (vitERE) with an affinity that was three orders of magnitude greater than that for a mutated form of the ERE (mutERE) bearing 1 base change per half-site in a salt-dependent manner. This unpurified ER also bound to the vitERE with an affinity that was five orders of magnitude greater than that for plasmid DNA. The highest level of discrimination was found with binding buffer containing physiological levels of salt (17Murdoch F.E. Grunwald K.A.A. Gorski J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10838-10844Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The ability of purified ER to discriminate between ERE sequences in the absence of other proteins at various salt concentrations has not been examined in such detail under equilibrium conditions. The amino acid sequences in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of ER that are necessary for specific interaction of the ER with ERE have been located in the N-terminal zinc finger (18Danielsen M. Hinck L. Ringold G.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1131-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 19Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and verified by the crystal structure of the DBD bound to the ERE (20Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Although a great deal of evidence has been accrued for the ER DBD, there are several functional differences noted between the DBD fragment and the full-length receptor. The DBD binds to the ERE with lower affinity than the full-length ER (21Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Erijman L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24070-24076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA bending induced by ER DBD binding was found to be 34°, rather than the 56° bending detected for the full-length receptor (22Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Nardulli A.M. Greene G.L. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Studies using a construct consisting of the DBD from region C plus sequences from region D indicated that this larger protein fragment bound to imperfect ERE sequences more stably than the DBD alone (19Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggest that protein sequences other than those present in the DBD may be important for high affinity binding of the ER to the ERE. The role of E2 in the ability of ER to bind to DNA has been controversial. Previous models of E2 action suggested that hormone binding induced interaction of ER with DNA. Several studies using gel shift analysis and quantitative DNA binding assays have indicated that E2-occupied and unoccupied ER from rat uterine extracts bind to ERE sequences with similar affinity (24Murdoch F.E. Meier D.A. Furlow J.D. Grunwald K.A.A. Gorski J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Furlow J.D. Murdoch F.E. Gorski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12519-12525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-independent binding of human ER to ERE sequences has also been reported in transiently transfected cells (26Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6595-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and in whole cells containing endogenous ER (27Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that human ER expressed from a recombinant baculovirus and produced byin vitro transcription/translation requires E2for DNA binding (28Beekman J.M. Allan G.F. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1266-1274PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, we used fluorescence anisotropy to examine the specificity and affinity of the ER-ERE interaction under equilibrium conditions. The ability of the full-length purified ER and ER DBD to discriminate between the consensus ERE and the mutERE was compared under various salt conditions. Since ER has been reported to interact with the ERE as either a dimer (20Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D.

The role of E2 in ER binding to the ERE was also examined using this equilibrium technique. The baculovirus-expressed, purified human ER was kindly provided by PanVera Corporation in storage buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5m KCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 0.02% sodium azide. The purity of the human ER was estimated as 80%. Mouse ER was prepared from recombinant baculovirus-infected SF21 cells using established procedures and purified using a DNA affinity column. 2I. Anderson, C. Bartley, W. Gray, and J. Gorski, manuscript in preparation. The concentration of active ER, based on estrogen-binding ability, was determined by a modification of the hydroxylapatite receptor assay (24Murdoch F.E. Meier D.A. Furlow J.D. Grunwald K.A.A. Gorski J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The DNA binding ability of each ER preparation was compared by gel shift analysis (see below). The DBD of the Xenopus ER was prepared as described previously (21Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Erijman L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24070-24076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 35-bp oligonucleotide containing the vitERE and its flanking sequences was synthesized and reverse-phase purified (Research Genetics, Inc.). The sense strand was labeled with fluorescein-maleimide at a thio-reactive ATP generated at the 5′ end, using the FluoroAmp™ T4 kinase green oligonucleotide labeling system (Promega Corp.). The fluorescein-labeled sense strand in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) was separated from free fluorescein on a 20-cm Sephadex G-25 desalting column (31Hill J.J. Royer C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 390-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The absorbance spectrum from 250–600 nm and the fluorescence anisotropy (see below) of each column fraction was measured. The concentration (C) of the oligonucleotide was calculated from its absorbance at 260 nm (A 260), which was corrected for the absorbance of fluorescein at 260 nm by using the following equation C=A260−(0.35×A494)(10,000L/mol·cm)×NEquation 1 where N equals the number of base pairs and L is liter. The absorbance of fluorescein at 260 nm represents 35% of its absorbance at 494 nm (A 494). The degree of fluorescein incorporation (FI) was calculated as follows FI=(N×10,000/65,000)×A494A260−(0.35×A494)Equation 2 where 65,000 is the fluorescein extinction coefficient. Column fractions of oligonucleotides corresponding to a high degree of fluorescein substitution and an anisotropy value for fluorescein-bound oligonucleotide, in comparison to values for free fluorescein, were frozen at −20 °C for further use. The resulting fluorescein-labeled sense strand was mixed with unlabeled antisense strand, heated to 95 °C for 2 min, and slowly cooled to room temperature for 2–4 h to anneal. The resulting 35-bp annealed oligonucleotide, designated F-vitERE, is shown in Sequence 1. 5′F­AGCTTCGAGGAGGTCACAGTGACCT_GGAGCGGATC­3′3′­TCGAAGCTCCTCCAGTGTCACTGGA_CCTCGCCTAG­5′.The 6-bp inverted repeat half-sites separated by the 3-bp spacer are underlined. An unlabeled version of vitERE for competition assays was annealed as described above. A 35-bp oligonucleotide containing a mutated vitERE (F-mutERE) was synthesized, labeled with fluorescein-maleimide using the same method as for F-vitERE, and annealed as described previously. F-mutERE is shown in Sequence 2. 5'F-AGCTTCGAGGAG_A__TCACAGTGA_T__CT_GGAGCGGATC-3'3'-TCGAAGCTCCTC_T__AGTGTCACT_A__GA_CCTCGCCTAG-5' .The sequences in each of the two half-sites that deviate from F-vitERE are marked with a double underline. Unlabeled mutERE oligonucleotide was also annealed as described previously for use as a competitor. Each reaction contained 2.0 pmol of purified ER, occupied with 5-fold excess E2 (Sigma) for at least 1 h at 4 °C, and 2.5 pmol of fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 μm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.24 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 100 mm KCl. The samples were incubated for at least 16 h at 4 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 19:1) in 50 mm Tris, 0.4m glycine, and 1 mm EDTA at room temperature and detected by fluorimaging (Molecular Dynamics Fluorimager SI). The fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide was diluted to the appropriate concentration in fluorescence anisotropy buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 μm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 100 to 300 mm KCl or NaCl). Ligand-bound ER was prepared by incubating undiluted purified ER with 5–10-fold molar excess of E2 (Sigma) for at least 1 h at 4 °C. The ER was then diluted to the appropriate starting concentration in binding buffer containing fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide in the first sample tube with salt and oligonucleotide concentrations adjusted to correct for any dilution from the large volume ER addition. The ER was serially diluted from the starting tube into the samples tubes containing fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide, and the samples were incubated for at least 1 h on ice to allow protein-DNA complex formation. Longer incubations did not increase the anisotropy values observed for the ER·ERE complex, indicating that the reactions were at equilibrium. After prewarming samples to 21 °C for 2 to 3 min, fluorescence anisotropy and total intensity were measured for each dilution using an ISS KOALA fluorometer (ISS, Inc.) in photon counting mode. Samples were excited in L-format by 488-nm light from a Omnichrome 543-AP CW argon ion laser defocused through an Oriel multifiber optic bundle. The parallel and perpendicular emission components were measured through a Corion 530 high pass filter. Each sample emission measurement was corrected by subtraction of the background buffer emission measurement. Anisotropy of fluorescence was typically calculated from three to four emission measurements, and the average value was used. Standard deviation for the anisotropy values was 0.001 or less. Binding curve analysis was conducted using the numerically based BIOEQS program (32Royer C.A. Smith W.R. Beechem J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Royer C.A. Beechem J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 481-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Royer C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Given the concentration of the protein and DNA, the final stoichiometries of the interaction, and initial guesses for the ΔG for formation of the various bound species, BIOEQS calculates the concentration of the various species in the equilibrium binding curve numerically using a constrained optimization algorithm in which the mass balance constraints are incorporated as Lagrange multipliers (32Royer C.A. Smith W.R. Beechem J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The program then relates this species concentration vector to the observable parameter (in this case anisotropy) at each point in the titration, and fits for the free energy and plateau values by adjusting these floating parameters using a Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares algorithm. Since the final stoichiometries of the ER-ERE interaction are not known exactly, both a simple binding model and cooperative DNA-induced dimerization model were tested for their ability to describe the interaction of ER with the ERE. The simple binding model was used to determine ΔG for the binding of an ER monomer unit or a preformed ER-homodimer to the DNA. This model includes free ERE, free ER, and ER-bound ERE and can be described by ER+ERE⇄(ER1)EREEquation 3 The simple binding model does not discriminate between one ER monomer or two noninteracting monomers of equal affinity binding to the DNA. Since the ER concentration used in the assays was expressed as a monomer, the simple binding model was applied here to describe the binding of a single ER monomer to the DNA. This model could be used to describe the binding of the preformed ER dimer by an appropriate adjustment of the units for the concentration axis. The cooperative dimer model describes the DNA-binding of two ER proteins that interact with each other. This model incorporates free ERE, free ER monomer, ER monomer-bound ERE, amd ER dimer-bound ERE and can be described as 2ER+ERE⇄(ER)1ERE+ER⇄(ER)2EREEquation 4 In this more complex model, BIOEQS solves for ΔG for the formation of the monomeric ER-DNA species (ΔG 1) and the overall ΔG for the formation of the dimeric ER-DNA species (ΔG 2) from the free monomeric ER and unbound DNA. From the anisotropy data, the initial plateau corresponding to the unbound ERE and the end plateau corresponding to ER-bound ERE were also adjustable parameters during the fit. In the dimer fit, the plateaus were initially floated. Once the plateaus were defined, the monomer ER-DNA species was then assigned an anisotropy value that is halfway between the unbound ERE and ER-bound ERE plateaus, and the data were refitted. The ΔG for formation of the complexes is described by the following equations ΔG1°=−RT ln[ER][ERE][ER·ERE]Equation 5 ΔG2°=−RT ln[ER]2[ERE][ER2·ERE]Equation 6 The concentrations of the various species are indicated in the brackets. R represents the gas constant and T is the temperature. BIOEQS solves for the ΔG values, given the following mass balance constraints [ERE]T=[ERE]+[ER·ERE]+[ER2·ERE]Equation 7 [ER]T=[ER]+[ER·ERE]+2[ER2·ERE]Equation 8 where subscript T represents the total concentration of the species indicated in the brackets. Thus, BIOEQS solves this system of equations numerically. The ΔG values are adjusted using least-squares analysis. If the difference between ΔG 2 and ΔG 1 is significantly different from ΔG 1 alone, this difference in free energy may be attributed to protein-protein coupling. The free energy associated with the cooperativity (ΔG coop) of the system can be obtained from ΔGcoop=ΔG2−2(ΔG1).Equation 9 From the ΔG 1 values, the equilibrium dissociation constant (K d ) was calculated by the following relationship ΔG1=−RT lnKdEquation 10 Several degrees of error analysis were incorporated into the fitting and interpretation of the data. Each individual anisotropy measurement for a titration was obtained three to five times and the average anisotropy from these replicates is reported. The standard deviation of these measurements, which was ±0.001, was included in the BIOEQS input file along with the DNA concentration, protein concentration, and average anisotropy measurements. The χ2 (or variance) was calculated in the data fitting for each experiment, based on the residual anisotropy values, which are the differences between the raw and fitted anisotropy data. Rigorous confidence interval tests at the 67% level were calculated for each fit and reported as the error for ΔG values (35Beechem J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The protein-DNA complexes formed between purified baculovirus-expressed human ER and F-vitERE were examined by fluorescence-detected gel shift analysis and compared with the complexes formed between purified baculovirus-expressed mouse ER and F-vitERE (Fig.2). ER was occupied with E2prior to incubation with the fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. A single human ER complex with F-vitERE was detected (lane 7) and supershifted with antibody ER712 (lane 6). Although the peptide antigen used to produce antibody ER712 originated from the conserved hinge region of the rat ER, this peptide contains a two amino acid variation between the rat and human ER (36Furlow J.D. Ahrens H. Mueller G.C. Gorski J. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, a fourfold excess of antibody ER712 was used and completely supershifted the human ER complex. The human ER complex with F-vitERE and the supershifted complex aligned with the corresponding mouse ER complexes (lanes 2 and 3), indicating that the approximate sizes of the DNA-bound mouse ER and human ER complexes were similar. Although each reaction contained 2 pmol of ER, the intensity of the mouse ER·F-vitERE complex was greater than the human ER·F-vitERE complex, suggesting that the DNA binding ability of the mouse ER preparation or stability of the complex was better under these conditions. To examine specificity of binding, the complexes were competed with a 10-fold excess of either unlabeled vitERE or mutERE. The mutERE is a palindromic sequence containing a single base pair alteration in each of the half sites. The abundance of the single human ER complex with F-vitERE was not reduced when mutERE was included as competitor (lane 9) but its formation was diminished when vitERE was used as competitor (lane 8), indicating that the purified human ER specifically binds to the vitERE sequence. Likewise, the mouse ER complex with F-vitERE was competed with vitERE (lane 4) but not with mutERE (lane 5). To determine whether the purified ER preparations would bind to F-mutERE, several reactions were prepared in which the purified proteins were incubated with F-mutERE. The human ER unexpectedly bound to F-mutERE (lane 14) and the complex was supershifted with antibody ER712 (lane 13). Similarly, the mouse ER also bound to F-mutERE (lanes 11 and12). The competition experiments verified that both mouse ER and human ER bind with higher affinity to vitERE than to mutERE. These results also indicated that the purified mouse ER and human ER exhibit non-negligible affinity for the mutERE sequence under these conditions. The affinity of E2-bound human ER (ER-E2) for F-vitERE and F-mutERE in solution was next examined using fluorescence anisotropy assays. Fluorescence anisotropy has been used to study both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions (37Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 38Fernando T. Royer C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3429-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39LeTilly V. Royer C.A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13717-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and provides a means to measure molecular interactions under equilibrium conditions without the need to separate free and bound molecules (41Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The binding buffer conditions used were virtually identical to those for the gel shift assays, except that soybean trypsin inhibitor was substituted for BSA as carrier protein. At a salt concentration of 100 mm KCl, the anisotropy profile (Fig.3 A) for human ER-E2 binding to F-vitERE was characterized by an initial plateau for the unbound DNA, followed by a steady anisotropy increase as ER complexed with the fluorescein-labeled DNA, and concluded with a short plateau for saturated binding. At the highest ER-E2concentrations, the anisotropy increase following the short plateau probably indicates formation of higher order complexes. The total fluorescence intensity did not change significantly during the titration, indicating that the anisotropy signal was not convoluted with changes in fluorescence lifetimes or contaminated by scattered excitation light, and thus directly represents a molar quantity. The equilibrium binding profile for ER-E2 interacting with F-mutERE was very similar (data not shown). The data were not fitted because the upper plateau was not well defined. In agreement with the gel shift results, purified human ER-E2 bound with similar apparent affinity to both F-vitERE and F-mutERE at 100 mmKCl. The specificity of E2-occupied human ER binding to F-vitERE compared with F-mutERE was next examined in the fluorescence anisotropy assays by using incremental increases in the buffer salt concentration. In the lac repressor system, increasing salt concentration reduces nonspecific protein-DNA apparent affinity more strongly than specific affinity by competing for interaction with the negatively charged phosphate backbone (42Record Jr., M.T. Lohman T.M. de Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 43Record Jr., M.T. Ha J.-H. Fisher M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 291-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The total anisotropy change from the unbound F-vitERE to the human ER-E2 complex with F-vitERE was 0.02 anisotropy unit at 200 mm KCl (Fig.3 B), significantly smaller than the 0.06 anisotropy unit observed at 100 mm KCl, suggesting that ER may be aggregating on the ERE at 100 mm KCl. The anisotropy profile for ER-E2 binding to F-vitERE at 200 mmKCl (Fig. 3 B) exhibited a starting plateau, an anisotropy increase, and an ending plateau, indicating that this binding was saturable. The anisotropy increase observed for ER-E2binding to F-mutERE at 200 mm KCl (Fig.4 A) was shifted to higher protein concentration as compared with vitERE and did not plateau at the highest ER concentrations used, indicating a lower relative affini"

In fission yeast, overexpression of the essentialpad1 + gene confers pleiotropic drug resistance through a pathway involving an AP-1 transcription factor encoded bypap1 +. We have identified POH1, a human pad1 homologue that can substitute fully forpad1 + and induce AP-1-dependent drug resistance in fission yeast. POH1 also confers P-glycoprotein-independent resistance to taxol (paclitaxel), doxorubicin, 7-hydroxystaurosporine, and ultraviolet light when transiently overexpressed in mammalian cells. Poh1 is a previously unidentified component of the human 26 S proteasome, a multiprotein complex that degrades proteins targeted for destruction by the ubiquitin pathway. Hence, Poh1 is part of a conserved mechanism that determines cellular susceptibility to cytotoxic agents, perhaps by influencing the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of transcription factors.

Exposure of eukaryotic cells to any of a wide variety of cytotoxic agents can result in the appearance of multiply resistant subpopulations, a phenomenon that frequently limits the effectiveness of anticancer therapies. Much effort has been directed toward improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie such pleiotropic resistance. Many of these studies have used mammalian cell lines selected in vitro for their resistance to high concentrations of cytotoxic drugs. Under these circumstances the mechanism of resistance typically involves overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), 1The abbreviations used are: P-gp, P-glycoprotein; UCN-01, 7-hydroxystaurosporine; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: P-gp, P-glycoprotein; UCN-01, 7-hydroxystaurosporine; HA, hemagglutinin. a drug-excluding pump with broad specificity (1Riordan J.R.

Science. 1983; 221: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, P-gp overexpression fails to account for the majority of clinical drug resistances especially in solid tumors (3Kaye S.B. Am. J. Med. 1995; 99 (6A44S): 6A40SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and the key determinants of this phenomenon remain largely unknown.We have taken an alternative route to the identification of human proteins potentially involved in pleiotropic drug resistance. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is established as a model organism in which powerful genetical approaches can be used to elucidate fundamental but complex eukaryotic processes such as mitosis (4Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the pad1 + gene inS. pombe was recently found to confer moderate resistance to the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine and a variety of other drugs including caffeine and the spindle poison thiabendazole (5Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yanagida M. Toda T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 569-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Usui T. Yoshida M. Honda A. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Gene. 1995; 161: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 7Kumada K. Yanagida M. Toda T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 59-68PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified a human functional pad1 homologue (Poh1) that confers moderate resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and also to ultraviolet light when transiently overproduced in mammalian cells. Poh1 is a previously unidentified component of the 26 S proteasome and genetical data suggest that Poh1-induced drug resistance is mediated through AP-1 transcription factors.DISCUSSIONThe validity of fission yeast as a model organism with which to investigate drug resistance in mammals is confirmed by our demonstration that Pad1, a key determinant of pleiotropic resistance inS. pombe, is functionally conserved as Poh1 in human cells. In COS cells the response to a specific subset of cytotoxic insults is modified by overexpression of POH1 in such a way that cell survival is favored. Alterations in P-gp expression or intracellular drug accumulation do not appear to be involved, but it is not clear at this stage if the POH1-induced survival advantage reflects a decreased propensity for cell death or an alteration in the processing of potentially lethal damage. POH1 can also induce drug resistance in fission yeast, which lacks the apoptotic cell death program, suggesting that modulation of apoptosis is unlikely to be solely responsible for POH1-induced resistance in mammalian cells.Poh1 is a novel component of the 26 S proteasome, indicating that proteolysis is involved in determining the sensitivity of human cells to cytotoxic treatments. A number of recent reports lend weight to this idea. Mutations in the fission yeast proteasome components encoded bymts2 + and mts3 + (21Gordon C. McGurk G. Wallace M. Hastie N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5704-5711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 366: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) are temperature-sensitive for growth and confer resistance to the spindle poison methyl benzimidazole-2-yl carbamate at the permissive temperature. Interestingly, overexpression of POH1 in fission yeast also induces resistance to this drug.2 Furthermore tumor necrosis factor-induced killing of human fibrosarcoma cells was modulated by proteasome inhibitors (23Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). We therefore consider it likely that Poh1 induces drug resistance by modulation of a mammalian proteasome activity.Poh1 and AP-1 Transcription FactorsThe requirement for Pap1 in Pad1/Poh1-induced drug resistance in fission yeast and the similarity between Poh1 and Jab1 suggest that modulation of transcription could underlie the induction of drug resistance by the Poh1 proteasome component. Indeed, overexpression of Pap1 in fission yeast results in a pattern of drug resistance indistinguishable from that seen on overexpression of Pad1/Poh1 (5Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yanagida M. Toda T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 569-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). What then might be the significant targets of AP-1 that induce resistance to cytotoxic agents? Mammalian AP-1-responsive genes reported include those encoding glutathione S-transferase Ya and π, elevated levels of which could contribute to cellular resistance (24Moffat G.J. McLaren A.W. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16397-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pinkus R. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly in budding yeast the promoter of the GSH1 gene has been shown to be AP-1 responsive (26Wu A.L. Moye Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This gene encodes γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, which performs the rate-limiting step in glutathione biosynthesis and can influence cellular drug resistance. However, the observation in budding yeast of AP-1-induced resistance to nitrosoguanidine suggests that glutathione-independent mechanisms are also significant (27Grey M. Brendel M. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 469-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In line with our observation of unaltered P-gp expression on POH1 overexpression, AP-1-mediated drug resistance in budding and fission yeast was found to be independent of endogenous P-gp-related drug transporters (6Usui T. Yoshida M. Honda A. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Gene. 1995; 161: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,28Dexter D. Moye Rowley W.S. Wu A.L. Golin J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 7106-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and elevated expression of one or other of these AP-1 factors has been correlated with drug resistance in a number of instances (24Moffat G.J. McLaren A.W. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16397-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yao K.S. Godwin A.K. Johnson S.W. Ozols R.F. O'Dwyer P.J. Hamilton T.C.

Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of c-Jun appears to be regulated in response to signals transduced by mitogen-activated protein kinase (35Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In addition, murine cells lacking c-Fos were found to be sensitized to UV radiation (36Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), although DNA repair was not defective, suggesting a role for AP-1 factors in a pathway that modulates cell survival after exposure to a given level of cytotoxic insult. Our results suggest that Poh1, a component of the 26 S proteasome, also participates in such a pathway in mammalian cells. This pathway is potentially involved in clinical resistance to anticancer drugs, and our preliminary data indicate that Poh1 is widely but variably expressed in human cancer cell lines. 3V. Spataro and C. Norbury, unpublished data. The extent of the involvement of Poh1 in clinical drug resistance awaits further investigation.A further direct connection between ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and transcription factors arose with the recent description of budding yeast Sug1 and its mammalian counterpart (mSug1/Trip1/FZA-B) both as a transcriptional co-activator and as a component of the 26 S proteasome (37Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J.F. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 38Akiyama K. Yokota K. Kagawa S. Shimbara N. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Noda C. Tanaka K.

Nature. 1996; 379: 655-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mammalian mSug1 associates with c-Fos via its leucine zipper (40Wang W. Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8236-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and also with a number of transcription factors of the nuclear receptor family (41vom Baur E. Zechel C. Heery D. Heine M.J. Garnier J.M. Vivat V. Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It is not clear at this stage whether Sug1 (and, by extension, Pad1/Poh1) acts as a proteasomal receptor for transcription factors that have been targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, or if the 26 S proteasome component and transcription factors interact for other reasons. It is nonetheless intriguing that the c-Jun binding protein Jab1, which was identified as a transcriptional co-activator (16Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) is clearly a close relative of Pad1/Poh1, identified here as a component of the 26 S proteasome. It seems possible that coordination of proteolysis with transcriptional activation could be significant in the modulation of transcriptional responses to a wide variety of stimuli. Exposure of eukaryotic cells to any of a wide variety of cytotoxic agents can result in the appearance of multiply resistant subpopulations, a phenomenon that frequently limits the effectiveness of anticancer therapies.

Overexpression of the pad1 + gene inS. pombe was recently found to confer moderate resistance to the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine and a variety of other drugs including caffeine and the spindle poison thiabendazole (5Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yanagida M. Toda T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 569-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Usui T. Yoshida M. Honda A. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Gene. 1995; 161: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 7Kumada K. Yanagida M. Toda T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 59-68PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified a human functional pad1 homologue (Poh1) that confers moderate resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and also to ultraviolet light when transiently overproduced in mammalian cells. Poh1 is a previously unidentified component of the 26 S proteasome and genetical data suggest that Poh1-induced drug resistance is mediated through AP-1 transcription factors. DISCUSSIONThe validity of fission yeast as a model organism with which to investigate drug resistance in mammals is confirmed by our demonstration that Pad1, a key determinant of pleiotropic resistance inS. pombe, is functionally conserved as Poh1 in human cells. In COS cells the response to a specific subset of cytotoxic insults is modified by overexpression of POH1 in such a way that cell survival is favored. Alterations in P-gp expression or intracellular drug accumulation do not appear to be involved, but it is not clear at this stage if the POH1-induced survival advantage reflects a decreased propensity for cell death or an alteration in the processing of potentially lethal damage. POH1 can also induce drug resistance in fission yeast, which lacks the apoptotic cell death program, suggesting that modulation of apoptosis is unlikely to be solely responsible for POH1-induced resistance in mammalian cells.Poh1 is a novel component of the 26 S proteasome, indicating that proteolysis is involved in determining the sensitivity of human cells to cytotoxic treatments. A number of recent reports lend weight to this idea. Mutations in the fission yeast proteasome components encoded bymts2 + and mts3 + (21Gordon C. McGurk G. Wallace M. Hastie N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5704-5711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 366: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) are temperature-sensitive for growth and confer resistance to the spindle poison methyl benzimidazole-2-yl carbamate at the permissive temperature. Interestingly, overexpression of POH1 in fission yeast also induces resistance to this drug.2 Furthermore tumor necrosis factor-induced killing of human fibrosarcoma cells was modulated by proteasome inhibitors (23Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). We therefore consider it likely that Poh1 induces drug resistance by modulation of a mammalian proteasome activity.Poh1 and AP-1 Transcription FactorsThe requirement for Pap1 in Pad1/Poh1-induced drug resistance in fission yeast and the similarity between Poh1 and Jab1 suggest that modulation of transcription could underlie the induction of drug resistance by the Poh1 proteasome component. Indeed, overexpression of Pap1 in fission yeast results in a pattern of drug resistance indistinguishable from that seen on overexpression of Pad1/Poh1 (5Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yanagida M. Toda T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 569-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). What then might be the significant targets of AP-1 that induce resistance to cytotoxic agents? Mammalian AP-1-responsive genes reported include those encoding glutathione S-transferase Ya and π, elevated levels of which could contribute to cellular resistance (24Moffat G.J. McLaren A.W. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16397-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pinkus R. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly in budding yeast the promoter of the GSH1 gene has been shown to be AP-1 responsive (26Wu A.L. Moye Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This gene encodes γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, which performs the rate-limiting step in glutathione biosynthesis and can influence cellular drug resistance. However, the observation in budding yeast of AP-1-induced resistance to nitrosoguanidine suggests that glutathione-independent mechanisms are also significant (27Grey M. Brendel M. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 469-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In line with our observation of unaltered P-gp expression on POH1 overexpression, AP-1-mediated drug resistance in budding and fission yeast was found to be independent of endogenous P-gp-related drug transporters (6Usui T. Yoshida M. Honda A. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Gene. 1995; 161: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,28Dexter D. Moye Rowley W.S. Wu A.L. Golin J.

Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of c-Jun appears to be regulated in response to signals transduced by mitogen-activated protein kinase (35Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In addition, murine cells lacking c-Fos were found to be sensitized to UV radiation (36Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), although DNA repair was not defective, suggesting a role for AP-1 factors in a pathway that modulates cell survival after exposure to a given level of cytotoxic insult. Our results suggest that Poh1, a component of the 26 S proteasome, also participates in such a pathway in mammalian cells. This pathway is potentially involved in clinical resistance to anticancer drugs, and our preliminary data indicate that Poh1 is widely but variably expressed in human cancer cell lines. 3V. Spataro and C. Norbury, unpublished data. The extent of the involvement of Poh1 in clinical drug resistance awaits further investigation.A further direct connection between ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and transcription factors arose with the recent description of budding yeast Sug1 and its mammalian counterpart (mSug1/Trip1/FZA-B) both as a transcriptional co-activator and as a component of the 26 S proteasome (37Swaffield J.C.

Nature. 1996; 379: 655-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mammalian mSug1 associates with c-Fos via its leucine zipper (40Wang W. Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Garnier J.M. Vivat V. Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It is not clear at this stage whether Sug1 (and, by extension, Pad1/Poh1) acts as a proteasomal receptor for transcription factors that have been targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, or if the 26 S proteasome component and transcription factors interact for other reasons. It is nonetheless intriguing that the c-Jun binding protein Jab1, which was identified as a transcriptional co-activator (16Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) is clearly a close relative of Pad1/Poh1, identified here as a component of the 26 S proteasome.

However, the observation in budding yeast of AP-1-induced resistance to nitrosoguanidine suggests that glutathione-independent mechanisms are also significant (27Grey M. Brendel M. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 469-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In line with our observation of unaltered P-gp expression on POH1 overexpression, AP-1-mediated drug resistance in budding and fission yeast was found to be independent of endogenous P-gp-related drug transporters (6Usui T.

Our results suggest that Poh1, a component of the 26 S proteasome, also participates in such a pathway in mammalian cells. This pathway is potentially involved in clinical resistance to anticancer drugs, and our preliminary data indicate that Poh1 is widely but variably expressed in human cancer cell lines. 3V. Spataro and C. Norbury, unpublished data. The extent of the involvement of Poh1 in clinical drug resistance awaits further investigation.A further direct connection between ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and transcription factors arose with the recent description of budding yeast Sug1 and its mammalian counterpart (mSug1/Trip1/FZA-B) both as a transcriptional co-activator and as a component of the 26 S proteasome (37Swaffield J.C.

It is not clear at this stage whether Sug1 (and, by extension, Pad1/Poh1) acts as a proteasomal receptor for transcription factors that have been targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, or if the 26 S proteasome component and transcription factors interact for other reasons. It is nonetheless intriguing that the c-Jun binding protein Jab1, which was identified as a transcriptional co-activator (16Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) is clearly a close relative of Pad1/Poh1, identified here as a component of the 26 S proteasome. It seems possible that coordination of proteolysis with transcriptional activation could be significant in the modulation of transcriptional responses to a wide variety of stimuli. The requirement for Pap1 in Pad1/Poh1-induced drug resistance in fission yeast and the similarity between Poh1 and Jab1 suggest that modulation of transcription could underlie the induction of drug resistance by the Poh1 proteasome component. Indeed, overexpression of Pap1 in fission yeast results in a pattern of drug resistance indistinguishable from that seen on overexpression of Pad1/Poh1 (5Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yanagida M. Toda T. J.

What then might be the significant targets of AP-1 that induce resistance to cytotoxic agents? Mammalian AP-1-responsive genes reported include those encoding glutathione S-transferase Ya and π, elevated levels of which could contribute to cellular resistance (24Moffat G.J. McLaren A.W.

https://openalex.org/W2318094197,"Expression of the E1B 19K protein is required to inhibit apoptosis induced by E1A during adenovirus infection and transformation. E1B 19K is homologous to Bcl-2 in function and the two proteins also share limited amino acid sequence homology. Consequently, the E1B 19K and Bcl-2 proteins bind to and inhibit the cellular death-inducing proteins Bax, Bak and Nbk/Bik. Both E1B 19K and Bcl-2 localize to membranes of the nucleus and the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition to membrane association, and unlike Bcl-2, the E1B 19K protein is found associated with intermediate filament proteins in the cytoplasm and the nuclear lamina and copurifies with the lamins both during infection and transformation. While a membrane targeting domain at the C-terminus of Bcl-2 ensures its proper localization, the mechanism by which the E1B 19K protein localizes is unknown. Not surprisingly, lamin A fragments were cloned from a yeast two-hybrid screen for E1B 19K-interacting proteins. The interaction was demonstrated in yeast and mammalian cells in vivo and in vitro and was unique and specific to E1B 19K, with no interaction evident between Bcl-2 and lamin A. Mutants of lamin A/C which localized inappropriately in the cytoplasm or nucleus but retained E1B 19K binding, interfered with the nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic membrane targeting of the E1B 19K protein. Improper localization impaired the ability of the E1B 19K protein to inhibit apoptosis. Thus, proper localization of the E1B 19K protein is required for its function and the interaction of the E1B 19K protein with lamin A/C may represent a means for nuclear envelope localization."
https://openalex.org/W2037039296,"Heat shock gene expression is differentially regulated in cells exposed to stress stimuli and in cells undergoing processes of differentiation and development. Regulation of the classical heat shock response is mediated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), whereas heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) is activated in certain differentiating cells, for example during hemin-mediated differentiation of human K562 erythroleukemia cells. Hence, the signaling pathways leading to induction of heat shock gene expression upon different stimuli are likely to be distinct. We have used RNA arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction to identify genes that are differentially regulated upon activation of HSF1 and HSF2. In this study, we report that thioredoxin (TRX) expression is induced in K562 cells in response to hemin in an HSF2-dependent manner. Increased TRX expression was primarily detected on the transcriptional level, subsequently leading to elevated TRX mRNA and protein levels. Hemin treatment caused no reduction in cellular glutathione concentrations, indicating that the increased TRX expression was not due to oxidative stress. Studies using cell lines where overexpression of the HSF2-β isoform represses HSF2 activation implied that active HSF2 is required for transcriptional induction of TRX. Unlike HSF2, activation of HSF1 did not induce TRX expression. Taken together, our results suggest that HSF1 and HSF2 may regulate distinct target genes, and activation of HSF2 could be involved in the regulation of TRX expression during hemin-mediated differentiation of K562 cells.

The heat shock response, characterized by induction of heat shock gene expression leading to increased synthesis of heat shock proteins, is a ubiquitous cellular response to elevated temperatures as well as other forms of stress (for review see Refs. 1Lindquist S.

The regulation of heat shock gene expression in eukaryotes is mediated at the transcriptional level by pre-existing transcriptional activators, heat shock factors (HSFs), 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock transcription factor; GSH, glutathione; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RAP-PCR, RNA arbitrarily primed PCR; TRX, thioredoxin. 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock transcription factor; GSH, glutathione; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RAP-PCR, RNA arbitrarily primed PCR; TRX, thioredoxin. that bind to regulatory heat shock elements present in the promoter region of all heat shock genes (for review see Refs. 5Lis J.T.

InDrosophila, only one HSF has been identified, and this factor has both developmental and stress-responsive functions (8Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In mammals, two differentially regulated transcriptional activators exist; HSF1 is the functional homologue of the general HSF that is activated by classical stress stimuli, whereas HSF2 is activated during hemin-mediated differentiation of human K562 erythroleukemia cells (9Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 10Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell.

In addition, HSF2 is constitutively active in mouse embryonal carcinoma cells and during mouse embryogenesis and spermatogenesis (13Mezger V. Rallu M. Morimoto R.I. Morange M. Renard J.-P. Dev.

Yet the signals and signaling pathways leading to activation of HSF2 are not known. Furthermore, the observations that HSF2 recognizes heat shock elements slightly differently and activates heat shock gene expression less efficiently than HSF1 (9Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 17Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 3370-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have raised the possibility that HSF2 may have other target genes apart from the known heat shock genes. Recently, the existence of two distinct HSF2 isoforms, HSF2-α and HSF2-β, has been demonstrated in mouse tissues (19Fiorenza M.T. Farkas T. Dissing M. Kolding D. Zimarino V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The smaller isoform, HSF2-β, is generated from the transcript by an additional splice, resulting in the deletion of an 18-amino acid sequence relative to the larger HSF2-α isoform (20Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because the expression of HSF2-α and HSF2-β isoforms varies between different tissues, it is plausible that these two proteins are functionally distinct. In fact, HSF2-α has been shown to be a more potent transcriptional activator than HSF2-β, as analyzed by transient transfection in NIH 3T3 cells (20Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the hemin-mediated acquisition of HSF2 DNA binding activity and transcriptional induction of heat shock gene expression are repressed in cells overexpressing HSF2-β, as has been demonstrated by using stably transfected K562 cell clones that express various levels of mouse HSF2 isoforms (21Leppä S. Pirkkala L. Saarento H. Sarge K.D. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15293-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results imply that regulation of HSF2 activity is complex and involves differential expression of HSF2 isoforms presumably in a tissue- and/or cell type-dependent manner. RNA arbitrarily primed PCR (RAP-PCR) has been shown to be a powerful method for identifying transcripts that are differentially expressed during the cell cycle, tissue and organ development, and tumorigenesis (for review see Ref. 22McClelland M. Mathieu-Daude F. Welsh J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 242-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify genes that are differentially regulated during the HSF1-mediated heat shock response and upon activation of HSF2, we have used the RAP-PCR method described by Ralph and co-workers (23Ralph D. McClelland M. Welsch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10710-10714Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that TRX is transcriptionally induced in concert with activation of HSF2 in hemin-treated K562 cells but not upon activation of HSF1. This observation is of particular interest concerning the differential regulation of gene expression by distinct HSFs, apart from their established function in the transcriptional induction of heat shock genes. Human K562 erythroleukemia cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 units/ml), and 2 mmglutamine in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. K562 cells stably overexpressing HSF2-α and HSF2-β isoforms (21Leppä S. Pirkkala L. Saarento H. Sarge K.D. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15293-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.). Prior to exposure to hemin or heat shock treatments, 5 × 106 cells were plated in medium without G418. Hemin (Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 20 or 30 μm, and heat shock was performed in a 42 °C water bath. Cytoplasmic RNA from hemin- or heat shock-treated cells was isolated and treated with DNase I. RAP-PCR was performed as described by Ralph and co-workers (23Ralph D. McClelland M. Welsch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10710-10714Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed with an arbitrary primer (5′-CCCATACACGCGTATACTGG-3′). The same primer was used to amplify the cDNA in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The extended DNA products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing-type gel and visualized by autoradiography. PCR products representing the transcripts of interest were isolated from the gel, reamplified by PCR, cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and sequenced using the Sequenase reagent kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA isolated from hemin- or heat shock-treated cells was separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.), and hybridized at 65 °C with a [α-32P]dCTP (50 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol; ICN)-labeled 500-base pair insert of human TRX and plasmids specific for human hsp70 (24Wu B.

The intensities of radioactive signals were quantitated using phosphoimaging (Bio-Rad), and the obtained values were normalized against β-actin. Nuclear run-on transcription reactions were performed with equal numbers of nuclei (7 × 106) isolated from hemin- or heat shock-treated cells in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]dUTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) as described previously (27Banerji S.S. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled RNA was hybridized to nitrocellulose-immobilized probes for TRX, hsp70,hsp90/89α, hsp27 (SPD-910, StressGen), and β-actin. Bluescript (Stratagene) was used as a vector control. The hybridizations were carried out at 42 °C for 72 h. Filters were washed with 0.2 × SSC-0.2% SDS at 65 °C and visualized by autoradiography. The intensities of radioactive signals were quantitated using phosphoimaging, and the obtained values were normalized against β-actin. Whole cell extracts were prepared from hemin- or heat shock-treated cells as described previously (28Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). 12 μg of protein was separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus. TRX was detected by a rabbit polyclonal anti-TRX antibody (29Berggren M. Gallegos A. Gasdaska J.R. Gasdaska P.Y. Warneke J. Powis G. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 3459-3466PubMed Google Scholar), the inducible form of Hsp70 by 4g4 (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.), and the constitutively expressed Hsc70 by SPA-815 (StressGen). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega and Amersham Corp. The signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). K562 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/3.5-cm-diameter plate prior to addition of hemin to a final concentration of 30 μm. At indicated time points, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellet was lyzed with 500 μl of 6% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation of the precipitated proteins, the cellular GSH concentrations were determined from triplicate samples as thiols soluble in trichloroacetic acid by colorimetric analysis as described previously (30Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar). Cells incubated for 1 h with 100 μm menadione (Sigma) were used as a positive control for oxidative stress. To assess the changes in gene expression occurring in concert with induction of heat shock gene expression in hemin-treated K562 cells, cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from hemin-treated and heat-shocked cells and analyzed by RAP-PCR. The expression patterns were compared with control mRNAs isolated from untreated cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, several transcripts were differentially expressed upon exposure to heat shock or hemin treatment. To determine whether the PCR products corresponded to inducible mRNAs, cDNAs were recovered, amplified, and subcloned. Subsequent sequence analysis using the GenBank™ data base revealed that one of the hemin-inducible cDNAs was identical to the sequence encoding human TRX (31Wollman E.E. d'Auriol L. Rimsky L. Shaw A. Jacquot J.-P. Wingfield P. Graber P. Dessarps F. Robin P. Galibert F. Bertoglio J. Fradelizi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15506-15512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern analysis confirmed that a 0.5-kilobase mRNA coding for TRX was specifically induced upon hemin treatment in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1 B). The mRNA levels of TRX increased gradually, reaching maximal levels at 16–24 h and declining back to basal levels by 72 h (Fig. 1 B). In comparison, expression of the major heat shock genes was analyzed from the same samples, showing marked increases of the hsp70 mRNA levels upon exposure to heat shock or hemin, whereas the hsp90 mRNA levels were only moderately increased (Fig. 1 B). Subsequently, TRX protein levels in untreated, heat-shocked, and hemin-treated K562 cells were analyzed by Western blotting using a TRX-specific antibody. Following increased amounts of TRX mRNA, the levels of TRX protein increased within 16 h of hemin treatment (Fig. 1 C). Accumulation of the inducible Hsp70 protein both in heat-shocked and hemin-treated cells and the constitutive expression of Hsc70 were consistent with our previous results (21Leppä S. Pirkkala L. Saarento H. Sarge K.D. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15293-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To examine whether induction of TRX expression upon hemin treatment was regulated on the transcriptional level, nuclear run-on assay was performed with nuclei isolated from heat-shocked and hemin-treated K562 cells. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1, heat shock did not induce transcription of the TRX gene (Fig. 2). In contrast, transcription of TRX was enhanced 2–3-fold upon exposure to hemin for 16–24 h. The kinetics of the transcriptional induction of TRX was similar to that of hsp70 and hsp90. Furthermore, transcription of both hsp70 andhsp90 was induced to a significantly higher level in response to heat shock (70- and 7-fold, respectively) than upon hemin treatment (2–3-fold), which is in agreement with previous studies, showing that HSF1 is a more potent transcriptional activator ofhsp70 and hsp90 gene expression than HSF2 (9Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar,18Kroeger P.E. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3370-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transcription of hsp27 gene, which was induced 6-fold by heat shock, was not markedly affected by hemin treatment. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that induction of TRX expression in hemin-treated K562 cells is primarily regulated on the transcriptional level. Because induction of TRX expression occurred in close correlation with the activation of HSF2, we next examined whether HSF2 could be involved in the hemin-mediated induction of TRX. For this purpose, we used transfected K562 cell clones constitutively overexpressing either HSF2-α or HSF2-β. Our previous studies have shown that upon exposure of the HSF2-β-overexpressing cells to hemin, the acquisition of HSF2 DNA binding and transcriptional activity was suppressed, whereas HSF2 was prominently activated in cells overexpressing HSF2-α, indicating that HSF2-β may function as a negative regulator of HSF2 activity during hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells (21Leppä S. Pirkkala L. Saarento H. Sarge K.D. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15293-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mock transfected cells (vector) and cells transfected either with HSF2-α (2α-F4 and 2α-C7) or HSF2-β (2β-C8 and 2β-D5) were exposed to heat shock or hemin, nuclei and total RNA were isolated and analyzed by nuclear run-on assay and Northern blotting, respectively. Consistent with the TRX induction in parental K562 cells (Figs. 1 B and 2), a 2–3-fold increase in transcription of TRX gene was detected within 16 h of hemin treatment in mock transfectants and 2α-F4 cells (Fig.3 A). However, the hemin-mediated induction of TRX transcription was clearly suppressed in 2β-C8 and 2β-D5 cells. Transcription of the hsp70 gene was similarly repressed in hemin-treated but not in heat-shocked HSF2-β-overexpressing cells, indicating that overexpression of HSF2-β did not interfere with the activation cascade of HSF1 (Fig.3 A; Ref. 21Leppä S. Pirkkala L. Saarento H. Sarge K.D. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15293-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the hemin-mediated increase in TRX mRNA levels was 2–3-fold in mock transfectants and HSF2-α-overexpressing cells, whereas TRX mRNA levels were not markedly increased in hemin-treated HSF2-β-overexpressing cells (Fig.3, B and C). In conclusion, these results suggest that regulation of TRX expression is dependent on HSF2 activation in hemin-treated K562 cells. TRX is a widely distributed redox protein that is known to play an important role in cellular responses against oxidative damage (for review see Refs. 32Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Powis G. Kirkpatrick D.L. Angulo M. Gasdaska J.R. Broome Powell M. Salmon S.E. Montfort W.R. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1996; 7: 121-126PubMed Google Scholar). Because induction of TRX could be a result of an altered cellular redox state, we wanted to determine whether possible redox effects could be underlying the observed increase in TRX expression upon hemin treatment. For this purpose, K562 cells were treated with hemin up to 72 h, and the concentrations of intracellular GSH were analyzed. Menadione, a pro-oxidant that causes oxidative stress by generation of superoxide radicals through redox cycling thereby reducing intracellular GSH levels (35Thor H. Smith M.T. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Jewell S.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12419-12425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chaput M. Brygier J. Lion Y. Sels A. Biochimie. 1983; 65: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig.4, unlike menadione, hemin caused no decrease but rather an increase in the GSH levels. Hence, hemin treatment does not cause oxidative stress in K562 cells. Elevated GSH levels were detected gradually after 16 h, and the maximum 4-fold increase occurred after 2 days of exposure to hemin, after which the GSH levels reached a plateau. A similar increase in the GSH levels was observed in HSF2-α- and HSF2-β-overexpressing cells (data not shown), indicating that GSH synthesis does not depend on activation of HSF2 in K562 cells. Previous studies have indicated that the signaling pathways of mammalian HSFs are distinct (9Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 10Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 12Sarge K.D.

Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Moreover, theDrosophila HSF has recently been shown to have multiple functions because mutational analysis has revealed that HSF inDrosophila is essential not only for the heat shock response but is also required during oogenesis and larval development (8Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the developmental functions of Drosophila HSF appear not to be mediated through the induction of heat shock genes (8Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies on HSF2 activation during mouse embryogenesis indicate that HSF2 activation and heat shock gene expression are not coupled (16Rallu M. Loones M. Lalleman Y. Morimoto R. Morange M. Mezger V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2392-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Together these studies implicate that under normal conditions, HSF (HSF2 in mammals) would be involved in the regulation of novel, presently unknown target genes. In this study, we have shown that upon hemin treatment of K562 cells, the activation of HSF2 is required for the transcriptional induction of TRX gene, in addition to the elevated expression of the classical heat shock genes. To our knowledge, this finding is novel and provides further insight on the differential regulation of gene expression upon activation of the distinct HSFs. TRX is a widely distributed redox-active protein that regulates intracellular redox-dependent processes, including transcriptional activity, proliferation, and apoptosis (Ref. 29Berggren M. Gallegos A. Gasdaska J.R. Gasdaska P.Y. Warneke J. Powis G. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 3459-3466PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Hence, TRX is associated with a number of crucial functions other than acting as an antioxidant. Interestingly, TRX, which has been identified also as adult T cell leukemia-derived factor, has been reported to be produced by many human T cell lymphotrophic virus-1-transformed T cells and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells (for review see Ref. 38Yodoi J. Tursz T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 57: 381-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Adult T cell leukemia-derived factor/TRX has been shown to act as a growth promoter of both normal and tumor cells (39Yamauchi A. Masutani H. Tagaya Y. Wakasugi N. Mitsui A. Nakamura H. Inamoto T. Ozawa K. Yodoi J. Mol. Immunol. 1992; 29: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Oblong J.E. Berggren M. Gasdaska P.Y. Powis G. J. Biol.

Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1643-1650PubMed Google Scholar) and to operate in synergism with interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 (42Wakasugi N. Tagaya Y. Wakasugi H. Mitsui A. Maeda M. Yodoi J. Tursz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8282-8286Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many human cancers overexpress TRX (43Nakamura H. Masutani H. Tagaya Y. Yamauchi A. Inamoto T. Nanbu Y. Fujii S. Ozawa K. Yodoi J. Cancer. 1992; 69: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 44Gasdaska P.Y. Oblong J.E. Cotgreave I.A. Powis G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These effects may all stem from its roles in gene expression by affecting the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of transcription factors, including NF-κB and AP-1 (45Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 46Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrügger W. Dröge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc.

Structure. 1995; 3: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that TRX enhances the DNA binding activity of AP-1 through a direct association with the redox/repair protein Ref-1 (48Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar,49Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Our results showing that TRX levels in K562 cells are elevated in concert with the differentiation-related processes induced by hemin occurring in the absence of oxidative stress favor the idea that TRX would function as an important effector protein in cell growth and differentiation. Furthermore, our study provides evidence that HSF2 would be an initiating factor for the elevated TRX expression in hemin-treated K562 cells. The mechanisms regulating TRX gene expression are poorly understood. The available data relate to transcriptional regulation during oxidative stress. A recent report on increased TRX expression following exposure to oxidative agents in Jurkat cells revealed specific DNA binding activities to the TRX promoter sequences that show no homology with any known consensus sequences for DNA-binding factors (50Taniguchi Y. Taniguchi-Ueda Y. Mori K. Yodoi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2746-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, we have no reason to believe that our results would be related to oxidative stress. Using the above-mentioned novel oxidative stress responsive element and nuclear extracts from hemin-treated K562 cells for gel mobility shift assay, we were not able to detect any inducible protein-DNA interactions (data not shown). Furthermore, oxidant-induced heat shock response has been demonstrated to activate HSF1 instead of HSF2 (51Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Polla B.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this study, we could not observe any activation of HSF1. Therefore, the observed HSF2 activation followed by elevated TRX expression appears to be a completely separate process from the oxidant-induced elevation of TRX expression. Interestingly, the increased expression of TRX was followed by elevated levels of GSH. However, our results show that the kinetics of GSH synthesis is clearly different from that of TRX induction. Whereas the GSH levels increase until 2 days of exposure to hemin, the induction of TRX expression seems to be transient, peaking at 16–24 h (Figs. 1 and4). This implies that hemin-mediated induction of TRX and regulation of the intracellular GSH levels are not directly coupled. Nevertheless, both GSH and TRX will contribute to shifting the intracellular environment toward a more reducing state. Little is known about the roles of GSH in differentiation-related processes. In this regard, K562 cells have previously been reported to synthesize and recycle GSH efficiently, and serum-starved K562 cells greatly increase their reduced GSH in response to growth factors by activating de novo biosynthesis (52Frischer H. Kennedy E.J. Chigurupati R. Sivarajan M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although it remains to be shown whether HSF2 is directly involved in the transcriptional regulation of TRX, our results on the transcriptional induction of TRX upon activation of HSF2 point toward a novel regulatory role of HSF2. In addition, this study further reinforces the distinction between the pathways leading to the activation of the mammalian transcription factors HSF1 and HSF2. We thank Garth Powis for kindly providing human TRX antibody, Dirk Bohmann for critical comments on the manuscript, and Helena Saarento for excellent technical assistance."

Therefore, to determine whether the gland-derived differentiation activity was a member of the LIF/CNTF cytokine family, we tested whether it acted via these same receptors and signal cascades. Blockade of LIFRβ inhibited the sweat gland differentiation activity in neuron/gland co-cultures, and extracts of gland-containing footpads stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of LIFRβ and gp130. An inhibitor (CGX) of molecules that bind the CNTFRα, which is required for CNTF signaling, did not affect the gland-derived differentiation activity. Soluble footpad extracts induced the same changes in NBFL neuroblastoma cells as LIF and CNTF, including increased vasoactive intestinal peptide mRNA, STAT3 dimerization, and DNA binding, and stimulation of transcription from the vasoactive intestinal peptide cytokine-responsive element.

Patterson P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, CNTF, LIF, and CT-1, members of a larger family of molecules known as the neuropoietic cytokines, are currently the only proteins known to produce the changes in sympathetic neuron phenotypein vitro that are observed during the development of the sweat gland innervation in vivo. Analysis of mice lacking CNTF and LIF reveals, however, that in the absence of both cytokines the sweat gland sympathetic innervation still acquires cholinergic properties and VIP immunoreactivity (25Francis N.J. Asmus S.E. Landis S.C. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, an antiserum that blocks CT-1 induction of cholinergic differentiation in cultured sympathetic neurons does not inhibit the sweat gland-induced increase in cholinergic function (19Habecker B.A. Pennica D. Landis S.C. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, although LIF, CNTF, and CT-1 are the only currently identified proteins that produce all of the changes in sympathetic neuron phenotype induced by sweat glands, it is unlikely that any of them is responsible for the differentiation activity present in sweat glands. The LIF/CNTF/CT-1 family of cytokines elicits similar effects in a variety of cell types (20Pennica D. Shaw K.J. Swanson T.A. Moore M.W. Shelton D.L. Zioncheck K.A. Rosenthal A. Taga T. Paoni N.F.

The transmembrane receptor subunits LIFRβ and gp130 do not have intrinsic kinase activity, but their intracellular domains are constitutively associated with Jak tyrosine kinases (Jak1, Jak2, or Tyk2) (44Stahl N.

Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytokines LIF and CNTF alter sympathetic neuron phenotype and stimulate production of VIP in NBFL neuroblastoma cells through activation of LIFRβ/gp130 and the Jak-STAT pathway (52Symes A. Lewis S. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Lewis S. Rao M. Dauer W. Symes A. Landis S. Fink S. Hyman S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have therefore used primary sympathetic neurons and NBFL neuroblastoma cells to investigate whether the sweat gland-derived differentiation activity shares these receptors and downstream signaling pathways. We present evidence that the gland-derived activity requires LIFRβ, results in the activation of both LIFRβ and gp130, and does not require the CNTFRα. In addition, it causes the activation of STAT3 and stimulates transcription of the VIP gene via a cytokine-responsive element in the VIP promoter. Therefore, the sweat gland-derived differentiation activity shares signaling mechanisms with these cytokines and appears to be a novel member of the LIF/CNTF cytokine family. Cultures of sympathetic neurons were prepared from the superior cervical ganglia of newborn rats as described by Hawrot and Patterson (55Hawrot E. Patterson P.H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and modified by Rao and Landis (11Rao M. Landis S. Neuron. 1990; 5: 899-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To reduce the number of nonneuronal cells, neurons were preplated for at least 2 h, and then for 2 days after plating they were grown in the antimitotic agent cytosine arabinoside (araC; 10 μm). Primary cultures of rat sweat gland cells and sweat gland/neuron co-cultures were established as described previously (9Habecker B.A. Tresser S.J. Rao M.S. Landis S.C. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Co-cultures were harvested to assay neuronal choline acetyltransferase activity 5–7 days after the addition of sweat gland cells. Cytokines and antibodies were diluted in L15-CO2 and filter-sterilized before the addition onto cells. NBFL neuroblastoma cells were maintained as described previously (56Symes A. Rao M.S. Lewis S. Landis S.C. Hyman S. Fink J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected overnight by calcium phosphate precipitation, with 12 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 4 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid/35-mm plate. Cells were treated with cytokines or footpad extracts beginning 6 h after transfection; 36 h later, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. Luciferase was normalized to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity to control for transfection efficiency. Mice with targeted disruption of the genes for CNTF or LIF have been described elsewhere (57Masu Y. Wolf E. Holtmann B. Sendtner M. Brem G. Thoenen H.

Founder breeding pairs for CNTF-deficient mice were a kind gift of Dr. Hans Thoenen. CNTF-deficient mice were derived from these initial pairs and propagated by crossing homozygous null animals. Because LIF-deficient females are sterile (59Stewart C.L. Kasper P. Brunet L. Bhatt H. Gadi I. Kontgen F. Abbondanzo S. Nature. 1992; 359: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar), LIF-deficient mice were obtained from crosses of LIF-deficient males with LIF heterozygous females, and offspring were genotyped using PCR for LIF (25Francis N.J. Asmus S.E. Landis S.C. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and LacZ as described by Raoet al. (60Rao M.S. Escary J. Sun Y. Perreau J. Patterson P.H. Zigmond R.E. Brulet P. Landis S.C. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1175-1185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). PCR reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Footpad extracts were prepared from the rear footpads of rats and mice as described previously (9Habecker B.A. Tresser S.J. Rao M.S. Landis S.C. Dev.

Extracts were concentrated by centrifugation through Centricon 10-kDa filters, and protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce protein assay kit. Cholinergic function was determined by measuring the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the synthetic enzyme for acetylcholine, using the method of Fonnum (61Fonnum F. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) as modified by Rao (11Rao M. Landis S. Neuron. 1990; 5: 899-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Dopamine was quantified as a measure of catecholamine production (62Mains R.E. Patterson P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 329-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Co-cultures were homogenized in ice-cold 0.2 n perchloric acid, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatants were assayed for dopamine content by high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection as described (63Stephans S.E. Yamamoto B.K. Synapse. 1994; 17: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Statistical significance of results was analyzed by ANOVA using Statview 4.0. Asterisks indicate values that differ significantly from control values. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from NBFL cells treated with cytokines or footpad extracts by Nonidet P-40 lysis (64Montminy M.R. Low M. Tapia-Arancibia L. Reichlin S. Mandel G. Goodman R. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde, 1.3% agarose gels and electrotransferred onto GeneScreen membranes. Northern blots were hybridized as described with a 580-base pair fragment of human VIP (65Tsukada T. Horovitch S.J. Montminy M. Mandeland G. Goodman R.H. DNA. 1985; 4: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and rehybridized with a probe for the unregulated internal reference gene cyclophilin (66Danielson P.E. Forss-Petter S. Brow M.A. Calavetta L. Douglass J. Milner R.J. Sutcliffe J.G. DNA. 1988; 7: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar) to correct for loading differences. Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from sweat gland cells, neuron gland co-cultures, and the sciatic nerves, sweat glands, and rear footpads of adult rats using RNAzol B (67Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63225) Google Scholar). To prepare RNA for PCR analysis, 0.5 μg of total RNA was converted to cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers. PCR reactions were carried out with CNTF- (forward, 5′-ACAGTTGATTTAGGGGATGG-3′; reverse, 5′-AGGGAGACAGAGGTATGAGC-3′), oncostatin M- (forward, 5′-ACCTCACGGGGAACACAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TGAAGACCCTCCCCACTG-3′), or β-actin- (forward, 5′-TCATGAAGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGT-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATG-3′) specific oligonucleotide primers. Reaction products were subjected to gel electrophoresis, and some samples were denatured and transferred to Nytran membranes. Amplification reactions were carried out through 30 cycles, and the products were 420 base pairs (CNTF), 453 base pairs (OSM), and 285 base pairs (actin). Southern blots were hybridized as described previously (8Habecker B.A. Landis S.C. Science. 1994; 264: 1602-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and detected with a biotinylated CNTF oligonucleotide probe (5′-TCGTTGGAGTGAGATGACTGAGGCAGAGCG) using the Flash rad-free chemiluminescence system (Stratagene). NBFL cells were grown to confluency on 10-cm plates. Cells were treated with cytokines or footpad extracts for 15 min before harvesting in ice-cold PBS. Nuclear extracts were isolated, and binding reactions were performed as described previously (52Symes A. Lewis S. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The G3 synthetic complementary oligonucleotides 5′-GGGGATTTCCTGGAATTAAG-3′ and 5′-GGGGCTTAATTCCAGGAAATC-3′ were annealed and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Nuclear extracts (approximately 15 μg of protein) were incubated with 0.5 ng of labeled probe (approximately 250,000 cpm) for 20 min at room temperature before electrophoretic separation on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1) in 0.5 × TBE at 200 V. Antibodies, when used, were added 10 min prior to the addition of the probe. STAT1 and STAT3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Footpad and sciatic nerve extracts were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for identification of CNTF. Blots were blocked 1 h with 5% low fat dry milk in TBS-T and incubated overnight with anti-CNTF (the kind gift of Peter Richardson, Montreal General Hospital) diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution. Bound antibodies were detected using goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000) and visualized by chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). NBFL cells were grown to confluency on 10-cm plates. Cells were treated with cytokines or footpad extracts for 10 min before washing twice in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm sodium vanadate. Cells were harvested in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) with 1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of the inhibitors sodium vanadate (1 mm), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Cells were lysed by mixing for 10 min at 4 °C and were then spun at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was frozen at −80 °C. LIFRβ and gp130 immunoprecipitation and phosphotyrosine blotting was carried out as described (36Stahl N. Davis S. Wong V. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Biol.

To test whether the sweat gland-derived differentiation factor uses LIFRβ, we asked whether blocking LIFRβ prevented sweat gland-induced changes in the sympathetic neuron phenotype. Sympathetic neurons were co-cultured with sweat gland cells or treated with LIF or retinoic acid in the presence or absence of antisera that block LIFRβ function. Five to seven days after treatment and/or co-culture, cells were assayed for adrenergic and cholinergic function. The addition of two polyclonal antisera raised against the mouse LIFRβ (a kind gift of Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA) (68Richards L.J. Kilpatrick T.J. Dutton R. Tan S.S. Gearing D.P. Bartlett P.F. Murphy M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), each at a dilution of 1:100, prevented the LIF-induced increase in ChAT activity and suppression of catecholamine content in sympathetic neurons. Similarly, the addition of anti-LIFRβ to sympathetic neurons that were co-cultured with sweat gland cells inhibited both the induction of cholinergic and the loss of adrenergic properties in these neurons (Fig. 1,A and B). The retention of normal catecholamine content indicated that the lack of ChAT induction was not the result of compromised neuron health due to antibody treatment. Anti-LIFRβ did not inhibit the retinoic acid-induced increase in ChAT activity and decrease in catecholamine content, which is mediated through the retinoic acid receptor α (69Berse B. Blusztajn J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22101-22104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting that the blockade of ChAT induction and catecholamine suppression was specific to inhibition of LIFRβ. Similar results were observed in sympathetic neurons treated with footpad extracts from wild type and CNTF −/− mice rather than co-cultured with sweat gland cells (data not shown), indicating that inhibition of LIFRβ on neurons rather than gland cells was responsible for the lack of neuronal ChAT induction. These results suggest that the sweat gland-derived differentiation factor acts through the LIFRβ to induce changes in sympathetic neuron phenotype. Since the differentiation factor produced by sweat gland cells required activation of LIFRβ, we determined whether LIF itself was contributing to the differentiation activity in co-cultures. LIF does not appear to be produced by sweat glands in vivo (12Rao M.S. Patterson P.H. Landis S.C. Development. 1992; 116: 731-744PubMed Google Scholar, 25Francis N.J. Asmus S.E. Landis S.C. Dev.

https://openalex.org/W2023076500,"The sequences responsible for S phase-specific induction of the human thymidine kinase (TK) gene have been mapped to a small region that contains putative E2F binding sites. We have analyzed protein-DNA interactions at the TK promoter during cell cycle progression in human fibroblasts using an in vivofootprinting approach. We found 14 protein binding sites that were occupied in vivo. All of the sites (among them two inverted CCAAT boxes and several Sp1 sites) bound transcription factors constitutively throughout the cell cycle, i.e. none of the factor binding was cell cycle-dependent. An E2F-like site located between nucleotides −97 and −89 relative to the major transcription start site was protected in G0, G1, S, and G2 phases. This cell cycle-independent protection of E2F sequences in the TK promoter differs from the G0/G1-restricted binding of E2F complexes observed for genes in which the E2F sites function as repressor elements (Tommasi, S., and Pfeifer, G. P. (1995)Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 6901–6913; Zwicker, J., Liu, N., Engeland, K., Lucibello, F. C., and Müller, R. (1996)Science 271, 1595–1597). A comparison of several genes containing E2F motifs indicates that E2F sites located in proximity to the transcription initiation site (−50 to +20) in TATA-less promoters predominantly function as repressor elements, while in other genes constitutively bound E2F complexes located further upstream mediate activation presumably in conjunction with a functional TATA box.

A comparison of several genes containing E2F motifs indicates that E2F sites located in proximity to the transcription initiation site (−50 to +20) in TATA-less promoters predominantly function as repressor elements, while in other genes constitutively bound E2F complexes located further upstream mediate activation presumably in conjunction with a functional TATA box. A large number of reports document the pivotal role that the transcription factor E2F may play in coordinating transcription during the mammalian cell cycle, particularly in the induction of specific genes at the G1/S transition (1Nevins J.R.

E2F was initially identified as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein complex required for the E1A-dependent transcription of the adenovirus early E2 gene (5Kovesdi I. Reichel R. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1986; 45: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Five distinct members of the E2F family (E2F-1 through E2F-5) have so far been identified (3La Thangue N.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 4Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These transcription factors heterodimerize in vivo with different DP proteins (DP-1 through DP-3) and this interaction appears to be essential for both high affinity DNA binding and E2F-dependent transactivation (6Helin K.

A number of proliferation-associated genes such as those encoding c-myc, B-myb, DNA polymerase α, dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase (TK), 1The abbreviations used are: TK, thymidine kinase; LM, ligation-mediated; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CCRU, cell cycle regulatory unit; CDE, cell cycle-dependent element; CHR, cell cycle genes homology region; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: TK, thymidine kinase; LM, ligation-mediated; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CCRU, cell cycle regulatory unit; CDE, cell cycle-dependent element; CHR, cell cycle genes homology region; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; bp, base pair(s). cyclin A,cdc2, and E2F-1 contain potential recognition sites for E2F in their promoters and these sequences are important for cell cycle regulation of these genes (9Hiebert S.W.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6901-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The presence of E2F binding sites within the promoters of several genes coding for DNA synthesis enzymes suggests that growth regulation of these proteins may take place by a common mechanism. E2F sites can function as transcriptional activator or repressor elements which may be dependent on the stage of the cell cycle (18Zwicker J. Müller R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This dual role as an activator and/or repressor is perhaps also a function of the promoter in which the E2F sites reside or the nucleotide sequence of the E2F site. In vivo footprinting studies have shown that E2F complexes can be released from their promoter binding sites upon induction of certain cell cycle-regulated genes during cell cycle progression (17Tommasi S. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6901-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Zwicker J. Liu N. Engeland K. Lucibello F.C. Müller R. Science. 1996; 271: 1595-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Evidence from in vitro studies suggests that E2F complexes loose their DNA binding activity through kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the E2F protein by a cyclin A-Cdk2 complex (20Dynlacht B.D. Flores O. Lees J.A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1772-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 21Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S. Arany Z. Kaelin W.G. Livingston D.M.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8420-8431Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to investigate whether the release of E2F complexes is a feature of all E2F-regulated genes or whether this release may depend on promoter context or the functional role of the E2F complexes. The human thymidine kinase gene is cell cycle regulated at the transcriptional level. Using deletion and site-directed mutational analysis, it was established that the upstream sequences of the human TK promoter, spanning nucleotides −133 to −64, designated CCRU (cell cycle regulatory unit), were sufficient to confer cell cycle regulation (23Roehl H.H. Conrad S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3834-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Kim Y.K. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2296-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this 70-bp CCRU domain is able to confer G1-S regulation onto a non-cell cycle-regulated, heterologous promoter (24Kim Y.K. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2296-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This sequence includes the distal CCAAT box element, and three GC-rich motifs that resemble a consensus E2F binding site. Mutations of these elements almost completely abolished the promoter activity (25Kim Y.K. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2723-2727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, one of the regulatory sites in the mouse TK promoter (MT2, −81 GTTCGCGGGCAAATG), is an E2F-like binding site that interacts with a fusion protein containing human E2F and mouse nuclear protein complexes containing E2F, p107, Cdk2, cyclin A, and cyclin E in a cell cycle-dependent manner (26Dou Q.-P. Zhao S. Levin A.H. Wang J. Helin K. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1306-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons, a member of the E2F family can be considered a likely candidate for cell cycle regulation of the human thymidine kinase gene. However, despite the analogy with murine E2F-related cis-regulatory elements and the discovery that complexes containing cyclin A, p107 and p33 cdk2 associate with a 25-bp long sequence inside the regulatory region, the involvement of E2F in human TK regulation is unclear (27Li L.-J. Naeve G.S. Lee A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3554-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Good L. Chen J. Chen K.Y. J. Cell.

Rawlings S.L. Li L.-J. Roy B. Lee A.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1741-1749PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the in vivo occupancy of the various cis-regulatory elements within the TK promoter region, especially in relationship to the involvement of E2F in proliferation control. The 70-bp CCRU and 100 nucleotides of the surrounding sequences on both sides including the transcription initiation site were analyzed throughout the cell cycle with a high resolution in vivo footprinting method (31Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 32Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Our data provides direct evidence that the occupancy of this E2F site is constitutive throughout the cell cycle. Conditions for culturing and synchronization of normal human foreskin fibroblasts (strain HF-39) have been described previously (17Tommasi S. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6901-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cells were brought to quiescence by serum deprivation for 14 days, then stimulated to proliferate by the addition of fresh medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) containing 15% fetal calf serum and harvested at various time points. HF-39 fibroblasts were serum-stimulated after 14 days of serum starvation and cell synchrony was monitored by flow cytometric analysis. Growth-arrested and serum-stimulated fibroblasts were stained with propidium iodide as recommended by the supplier (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Samples were run on a FACS IV (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer. Data was acquired and analyzed on a Cicero Workstation (Cytomation, Ft. Collins, CO). Subconfluent HF-39 fibroblasts were rendered quiescent by incubation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 14 days. After addition of 15% fetal calf serum, cells were collected at the times indicated, and total RNA was isolated by a guanidine isothiocyanate method (RNAgentsTM, Promega). A 10-μg aliquot of each RNA sample was separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a GeneScreen (NEN Life Science Products) nylon membrane. The membrane was then hybridized at 60 °C in 0.25 m sodium phosphate (ph 7.2), 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin with a probe specific for the 7th exon of the human TK gene. A probe specific for the GAPDH gene was used as a control. Immediately after the serum starvation period and at different time points after serum stimulation, subconfluent fibroblasts were treated with 0.2% DMS, and nuclei were isolated as described previously (17Tommasi S. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6901-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). DNA was isolated from pelleted nuclei and cleaved at methylated bases with hot piperidine. The chemically cleaved DNA was then amplified by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), the sequence ladders were separated on 8% acrylamide, 7 m urea gels in 0.1m Tris-borate-EDTA, and transferred to nylon membranes (33Pfeifer G.P. Singer-Sam J. Riggs A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 567-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,34Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled single-stranded hybridization probes were synthetized by a PCR-based technique using primer 3 (see below) from the appropriate primer set (35Rozek D. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5490-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 36Tommasi S. LeBon J.M. Riggs A.D. Singer-Sam J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). G, G + A, C + T, and C reactions were obtained by in vitro treatment of purified DNA (either from fibroblasts or HeLa cells) with DMS (37Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8985) Google Scholar). Four gene-specific LM-PCR primer sets, selected with the aid of a computer program (38Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8543-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), were used to analyze the promoter region of the human TK gene and are listed below. Primers a1, b1, c1, and d1 were used for primer extension with Sequenase, primers a2, b2, c2, and d2 were used for PCR amplification and primers a3, b3, c3, and d3 were used to make hybridization probes. For analysis of the lower strand by LM-PCR, the following primers were used: tka1, CCCGATCAGCCACGTC, T m = 49.5 °C; tka2, CCACGTCCATCGCCCTGATTTC, T m = 62.2 °C; tka3, ATTTCCAGGCCCTCCCAGTCC, T m = 60.0 °C; tkb1, GAACCTTGCTTGGGCAAA, T m = 51.0 °C; tkb2, CCACACCAGACACATCCATCATGGCGTC, T m = 69.4 °C; and tkb3, ATCATGGCGTCTACAGCCGCATGG, T m = 65.6 °C. For analysis of the upper strand, the following primers were used: tkc1, CGGGAAGTTCACGAACC, T m = 48.0 °C; tkc2, GTTCACGAACCCGAGTACTCTCCAAG, T m = 60.3 °C; tkc3, TCTCCAAGGCCGTCCCGCAGTA, T m = 64.5 °C; tkd1, GGAGATTTGGCCGCAGC, T m = 53.8 °C; tkd2, CAGCCCGCCCCCTCGTGGGA, T m = 69.7 °C; and tkd3, AATCCGGGACGTGCGCCCAG, T m = 65.7 °C. Nonsynchronized fibroblasts and purified DNA from the same cells were irradiated with a germicidal UV lamp (254 nm). DNA isolation, cleavage at cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers with T4 endonuclease V and photolyase, and ligation-mediated PCR analysis were done essentially as described previously (34Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have used normal human foreskin fibroblasts for serum starvation and cell synchronization experiments. We found that serum starvation for 48 h did not give a high degree of cell cycle synchrony. Serum starvation for longer periods of time (up to 14 days) drastically improved levels of synchrony after restimulation with serum. We determined cell cycle progression in cells that were serum-deprived for 14 days by flow cytometry and propidium iodide staining (Fig. 1). This analysis shows that more than 95% of the cells were in G0after serum starvation (0 h), cells started to move into S phase between 18 and 24 h, and about 80% had reached S and G2 phase after 30 h. Cells returned to a G1 DNA content after 37 h. This degree of cell cycle synchrony is required for the in vivo footprinting studies at different phases of cell cycle progression. The expression of the human TK gene is cell cycle-regulated and its induction is serum-dependent in normal human cells (39Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar, 40Stuart P. Ito M. Stewart C. Conrad S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1490-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At the onset of DNA synthesis, after serum-deprived or quiescent cells are stimulated to proliferate, there is a severalfold increase in the rate of transcription of the TK gene. The induction of the human TK gene after serum stimulation was determined in synchronized fibroblasts by Northern blot analysis. TK mRNA was almost undetectable in quiescent cells (Fig. 2). Steady-state levels of TK mRNA increased sharply just before the cells entered S phase (between 12 and 18 h after serum stimulation) and reached maximum levels after 24 to 30 h, when the majority of the cells are in S/G2. In asynchronously cycling HeLa cells, where transcriptional activation of the TK gene has been shown to be deregulated during the cell cycle (41Chen Z.-F. Cheng S.-M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3253-3256PubMed Google Scholar, 42Chang Z.-F. Huang D.-Y. Lai T.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27374-27379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), much higher levels of TK mRNA are present compared with those in unsynchronized fibroblasts (Fig. 2, last two lanes). To identify upstream regulatory elements, at which the binding pattern of transcription factors may change as a function of the cell cycle, we have investigated protein-DNA interactions in vivo at the TK promoter by a genomic footprinting technique. Human fibroblasts were treated with DMS, a methylating agent that reacts predominantly with guanines at the N-7 position, enabling later cleavage of the modified bases by hot piperidine. Sequence ladders were then amplified by LM-PCR and analyzed on sequencing gels as described (31Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 32Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 33Pfeifer G.P. Singer-Sam J. Riggs A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 567-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 43Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In a situation where transcription factors are bound to the DNA, they will either decrease accessibility of specific guanines to DMS (protection) or, often at the edges of a footprint, increase reactivity (hyperreactivity). When DMS patterns from naked DNA controls and patterns from serum-starved fibroblasts and cells at various time points following growth stimulation are compared, one might be able to detect protein-occupied sites and could therefore identify those elements at which changes in protein-DNA interactions occur during cell cycle progression. Four different LM-PCR primer sets were designed to analyze the 5′-flanking region of the human TK gene, beginning from approximately 300 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. First, we analyzed sequences between nucleotides −263 and −162 upstream of the transcription start site (Fig.3). There are several potential Sp1 binding sites located within this region. Clear footprints were observed at two Sp1 consensus sites (5′-GGGCGG and 5′-GAGGCGG) located between nucleotides −232 and −227 and nucleotides −223 and −217, respectively. Additional footprints were seen near another potential Sp1 binding site (5′-GGGTGGG, nucleotides −202 to −196; confirmed by analysis of the opposite strand) and a sequence near nucleotide −185, which interacts with an unknown factor. These protein-DNA interactions were all constitutive throughout the cell cycle, i.e. there was no change in the binding pattern at the beginning of S phase (18 h). Fig. 4 A shows a genomic footprinting analysis of upper strand sequences spanning from nucleotides −7 to −137 relative to the transcription start site. This region contains a putative TATA box, at position −21, which deviates by 1 nucleotide from the canonical TATA site, and two inverted CCAAT boxes, at positions −36 to −40, and −67 to −71, respectively. The two CCAAT elements have been reported to bind the transcription factor NF-Y (or CP1) in a cell cycle-specific manner (44Knight G.B. Gudas J.M. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8350-8354Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 45Pang J.H. Chen K.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2909-2916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Chang Z.-F. Liu C.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17893-17898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding of CCAAT-binding proteins may regulate S phase-specific transcription of TK. Deletion of both CCAAT boxes severely impaired promoter strength and excision of the distal CCAAT box seemed to be more deleterious than excision of the proximal CCAAT box (47Mao X. Xia L. Liang G. Gai X. Huang D.-Y. Prystowsky M.B. Lipson K.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 48Lipson K.E. Liang G. Xia L. Gai X. Prystowsky M.B. Mao X. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Both the proximal and distal CCAAT elements showed a similar in vivo footprint pattern (Figs. 4 and5). The two guanines of the core motif are partially protected from DMS modification at all time points. To further confirm protein binding at the two CCAAT boxes, we have also used UV light for footprinting (see below; Fig. 5). The constant DMS modification pattern at the two guanines indicates that these two elements are occupied in vivo before serum addition and during all subsequent phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 4 A). Thus, cell cycle-dependent binding of CCAAT box binding factors does not appear to be involved in TK gene regulation. Binding of these factors is constitutive, but may be regulated by posttranslational modification of promoter-bound factors.Figure 5UV photofootprinting of the CCAAT box elements in the human thymidine kinase promoter. Nonsynchronized fibroblasts were UV-irradiated at a dose of 1,000 J/m2(lane 6) or 2,000 J/m2 (lane 7). Naked DNA from fibroblasts was irradiated with 1,000 J/m2(lane 4) or 2,000 J/m2 (lane 5). The distribution of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers was mapped by ligation-mediated PCR. Two strongly UV-hyperreactive sites are seen at the TT sequences of the two inverted CCAAT boxes (ATTGG on this strand).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Farther upstream, near the top of the gel, an area of protection is evident. This area corresponds to an Sp1 consensus binding site (5′-GGGCGG), and also this site is occupied before serum addition and during all subsequent phases of the cell cycle. In Fig. 4 B the same sequences were analyzed on the opposite DNA strand. The TATA box, the two CCAAT elements (which are not footprinted on the C-rich strand), one Sp1 site as well as one additional footprint are indicated. An area of strong DMS protection is seen at a potential E2F site. This sequence (5′-CCTGGCGGG, nucleotides −89 to −97; the Gs protected from DMS modification are underlined) resembles a typical E2F consensus binding site (5′-TTTSSCGC, where S is G or C), found in other G1-S-regulated promoters. Since this sequence is located inside the CCRU, members of the E2F family may be involved in cell cycle regulation of the TK gene. As shown in Fig. 4 B, this footprint does not change as a function of the cell cycle, indicating that the E2F-like site is always occupied in vivo at various stages during cell cycle progression (G0, G1, S, and G2). Therefore signals other than sequence-specific binding to the DNA of the E2F-like factor must be involved in G1-S activation of the TK gene. To further confirm protein DNA interactions at the two CCAAT boxes which were only partially protected from DMS modification in vivo (Fig. 4 A), we have conducted a UV photofootprint analysis (Fig. 5). Fibroblasts were UV-irradiated and the distribution of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers was mapped and compared with that in irradiated naked DNA (34Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The UV photoproduct patterns are only slightly different between UV-irradiated naked DNA and UV-irradiated cells at the E2F binding site. However, there were two very conspicuousin vivo UV hyperreactive sites located at the TT sequences of both inverted CCAAT boxes. This hyperreactivity for pyrimidine dimer formation has been observed previously at other CCAAT boxes that presumably are binding sites for NF-Y (34Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The results provide additional evidence that the two CCAAT boxes in the thymidine kinase promoter interact with proteins in vivo. A summary of the in vivo footprinting results for the human TK promoter is shown in Fig. 6. From this genomic footprinting analysis, we have evidence for at least 14 different transcription factors. Among these footprints, we noticed a potential TATA box, two inverted CCAAT boxes and several Sp1-like binding sites. All of these sites were constitutively occupied by the factors as the cells proceeded from G0 into G1, S, and G2 phase. Several lines of evidence indicate that transcriptional regulation plays a key role in induction of the human TK gene in normal diploid cells following serum stimulation (45Pang J.H. Chen K.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2909-2916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Stewart C.J. Ito M. Conrad S.E. Mol. Cell.

Conrad S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3834-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 51Lipson K.E. Chen S.-T. Koniecki J. Ku D.-H. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6848-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined cell cycle-specific binding of transcription factors at the promoter of the human TK gene. Fourteen putative protein-binding sites were identifiedin vivo by a genomic footprinting technique (for a summary see Fig. 6), suggesting that transcriptional regulation of the gene in a periodic fashion is probably accomplished through complex mechanisms. Ten of these sites correspond to well known regulatory elements, as deduced by sequence inspection and comparison with known factor-binding sites. They include a TA rich element which resembles a TATA box, two inverted CCAAT boxes and a series of GC elements, probably binding sites for Sp1, further upstream. The presence of CCAAT boxes and Sp1 transcription factor binding sites is a common feature of many cell cycle-regulated genes (18Zwicker J. Müller R.

The core of the CCRU contains three E2F-like sites (Fig. 7) and has been shown to form minor S-phase-specific complexes containing p107, cyclin A, and p33 cdk2 , in nuclear extracts isolated from growth-stimulated cells (27Li L.-J.

Nevertheless, the TK-specific complexes identified in previous work showed very little affinity for an oligonucleotide containing a consensus E2F motif (27Li L.-J. Naeve G.S. Lee A.S. Proc. Natl.

We have shown previously that it binds the microtubule binding domains of the microtubule-associated proteins, MAP2, MAP4, and tau. We also showed that mapmodulin is identical to a protein named PHAPI (Vaesen, M., Barnikol-Watanabe, S., Götz, H., Awni, L.A., Cole, T., Zimmermann, B., Kratzin, H.D. and Hilschmann, N. (1994) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 375, 113–126). We report here that mapmodulin is a phosphoprotein that is predominantly cytosolic but is also found peripherally associated with endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes in mammalian cells. The protein occurs as a trimer in cytosol, and phosphorylation is required for its microtubule-associated protein-binding activity. Heat treatment of nonphosphorylated mapmodulin can render it competent for binding to microtubule-associated proteins, suggesting that phosphorylation induces a conformational change in mapmodulin. Finally, despite identity in polypeptide sequence with a protein reported to act as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, native mapmodulin was not able to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A in Chinese hamster ovary cell cytosol.

This “Golgi capture” process requires intact microtubules, cytoplasmic dynein, ATP hydrolysis, as well as cytosolic and membrane-associated proteins (1Corthésy-Theulaz I. Pauloin A. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1333-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We have recently described the purification of a 31-kDa protein, named mapmodulin, that appears to be essential for Golgi capture (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have shown that mapmodulin binds MAP4, MAP2, and tau (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It binds free MAPs in strong preference to microtubule-bound MAPs and does so via the microtubule-binding domain of the MAP. Binding to each of these MAPs requires the carboxyl-terminal portion of mapmodulin and decreases the rate with which MAPs can subsequently re-bind to microtubules. We have proposed that mapmodulin represents a novel class of proteins that functions to displace MAPs transiently from microtubules, thereby permitting organelle translocation (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Peptide sequence analysis of mapmodulin revealed complete identity with “putative HLA-associated protein-I” (PHAPI; Ref. 3Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Götz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmermann B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PHAPI was purified from lymphoblastoid cell cytosol based on its ability to bind to a peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of the human HLA class II DR2α-chain. Despite the basic nature of the α-chain peptide employed, control experiments showed that basic residues were not sufficient for PHAPI binding (3Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Götz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmermann B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Preliminary immunoelectron microscopy detected the protein over all cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm, membranes, and nucleus (3Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Götz H. Awni L.A. Cole T.

The same protein was also purified independently as LANP (4Matsuoka K. Taoka M. Satozawa N. Nakayama H. Ichimura T. Takahashi N. Yamakuni T. Song S.-Y. Isobe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). I1PP2Awas reported to specifically inhibit protein phosphatase 2A in in vitro assays (6Li M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this paper, we further characterize mapmodulin/PHAPI and show that it is an abundant cytosolic phosphoprotein, partially associated with ER and Golgi membranes. The predominant form of mapmodulin in cells is phosphorylated; phospho-mapmodulin binds to the MAP4 microtubule-binding domain with higher affinity than the dephosphorylated form, suggesting that this posttranslational modification plays a role in regulating MAP binding. Sequence alignments revealed that mapmodulin shares limited structural homology with CLIP-170, a putative endosome-microtubule linker protein (8Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 9Pierre P. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this sequence similarity, mapmodulin does not serve as a linker between the Golgi complex and microtubules. Finally, neither native CHO mapmodulin nor bacterially expressed, His-tagged mapmodulin inhibit protein phosphatase 2A under physiological conditions, in contrast to reports from another laboratory for the protein purified as I1PP2A. Antibodies, CHO mapmodulin, recombinant, His-tagged mapmodulin, and Golgi membranes were prepared as described previously (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purified bovine tubulin (10 mg/ml) was polymerized by incubation with 1 mm GTP and 20 μm taxol for 15 min at 37 °C. After ultracentrifugation, pellets were resuspended in PE buffer (85 mm K-PIPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 10 μm taxol) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. In a standard reaction, 6 μg of KCl-stripped Golgi membranes were incubated with 20 μg of microtubules in PE buffer for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 100 μg of cytosol. The reaction mix (50 μl) was layered over 40% sucrose in PE buffer and spun at 35000 rpm for 30 min at 25 °C in a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, California). Pellets were subjected to anN-acetylglucosamine transferase I enzymatic assay (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CHO cells were homogenized in SEAT buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) by 5 passages through a 22-gauge needle. Nuclei and debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor, and aliquots of the pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence was carried out essentially as described by Warren et al. (10Warren G. Davoust J. Cockcroft A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cells were permeabilized using 0.5% saponin or 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then incubated with anti-mapmodulin affinity-purified antibodies for 1 h at 22 °C. After washing, the cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:500. Slides were viewed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a Texas red filter (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT) with a × 100 Plan Neofluor, 1.3 oil immersion objective; images were recorded on Fuji 1600 film. The solid phase binding immunoassays were performed exactly as described (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Phosphatase assays were carried out using the Life Technologies, Inc. protein phosphatase assay system. Reaction mixtures contained assay buffer (20 mmimidazole-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm EDTA), 20 μl of CHO cytosol, 20 μl of 32P-labeled phosphorylase a (in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 mm caffeine, 1% β-mercaptoethanol), in a final volume of 60 μl. Reactions were initiated with the 32P-labeled substrate, and after 10 min at 30 °C, 180 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added. After incubating on ice for 20 min, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. The radioactivity in 200 μl of the supernatant was then measured in a scintillation counter. The effect of mapmodulin was measured by incubating cytosol with different concentrations of purified mapmodulin, or commercially purchased I1PP2A(CalBiochem). The concentration of cytosol used corresponded to the low linear range of phosphatase activity (2.9 μg/ml in assay buffer). CHO cytosol (50 μg) was incubated with 1 unit of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 37 °C as recommended by the manufacturer; the reaction was then terminated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Mapmodulin was purified from CHO cytosol on the basis of its ability to stimulate the dynein- and microtubule-dependent localization of Golgi complexes in broken cells (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As described above, mapmodulin is identical to PHAPI, a protein that was purified from human lymphoblastoid B-cell line cytosol on the basis of its capacity to bind peptides representing the basic, cytosolic tail of HLA class II α-chain (3Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Götz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmermann B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Mapmodulin (PHAPI) has a predicted mass of 28.4 kDa (3Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Götz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmermann B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When the native protein purified from CHO cytosol is resolved by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions, the protein has an apparent molecular mass of ∼31 kDa (Fig. 1). We have prepared a His-tagged recombinant form of mapmodulin and purified the protein after expression in Escherichia coli cells (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,lane 2); a His-tagged, carboxyl-terminal truncated form, which lacks the acidic region encoded by residues 164–249, was also generated (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (lane 3). Mapmodulin chromatographs as an apparent oligomer upon gel filtration chromatography. When purified CHO cell mapmodulin was fractionated on a Superdex 200 FPLC column at physiological ionic strength (PBS), it eluted just ahead of the 76-kDa marker, suggesting that under physiological conditions, the native protein may in fact be a trimer (Fig. 2 A). Cross-linking experiments carried out with purified, CHO cell mapmodulin (Fig. 2 B) or recombinant, His-tagged mapmodulinΔC (Fig. 2 C) revealed that both forms of the protein form trimers. These data suggest that mapmodulin is likely a trimer in CHO cytosol. In addition, the ability of the carboxyl-terminal truncated form to form apparent trimers indicates that the carboxyl terminus of the protein is not required for mapmodulin homo-oligomerization. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against purified, CHO mapmodulin and recombinant, His-tagged mapmodulin. In total CHO cytosol, anti-native mapmodulin recognized a single polypeptide by immunoblot analysis with an apparent mass of ∼31 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 4). The CHO cell protein was smaller in mass than the purified, recombinant mapmodulin, which contained additional histidine residues (Fig. 1, lane 5). The polyclonal anti-CHO mapmodulin antibodies were used to localize mapmodulin by indirect immunofluorescence of CHO cells. Using mild conditions for permeabilization (0.5% saponin), interphase cells exhibited an overall diffuse staining, as would be expected from a cytosolic protein. More rigorous detergent pre-extraction (0.2% Triton X-100) led to a clearer image of uniform labeling of what appeared to be both ER and Golgi membranes, suggesting that mapmodulin occurs in both soluble and membrane-bound forms (Fig.3 A). With longer times of detergent extraction, nuclear staining is also observed. These findings were consistent with previous preliminary immunoelectron microscopic localization of PHAPI in lymphoblastoid cells (3Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Götz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmermann B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To verify the membrane interaction of mapmodulin, we subjected a CHO cell postnuclear supernatant to flotation in a sucrose gradient. In these gradients, membrane-bound organelles float upward and can be readily resolved from cytosolic proteins. As shown in Fig.3 B, the bulk of a Golgi marker,N-acetylglucosamine transferase I (○, fractions 3–9), was well separated from the bulk of the protein that remained at the bottom of the gradient (⋄, fractions 15–22). Endosomes and lysosomes co-fractionate with Golgi on such gradients; ER membranes float to an intermediate density (not shown). While the majority of mapmodulin fractionated with soluble protein (•), a significant amount was detected in the lighter density, membrane-enriched regions of the gradient. These biochemical data confirm that mapmodulin occurs in both soluble and membrane-associated forms. Quantitation of fractionated CHO cells revealed that 3–5% of the cellular pool of mapmodulin is membrane-bound. This fraction can be stripped off of membranes with 0.5 m KCl (data not shown). Fig.4 A presents the sequence of PHAPI (3Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Götz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmermann B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the tryptic peptides we obtained from purified, CHO mapmodulin. The mapmodulin/PHAPI sequence is comprised of a generally basic, Leu/Ile- rich, amino-terminal region and a long, acidic carboxyl-terminal portion; the protein has an overall calculated pI of 3.7. The sequence does not contain consensus nucleotide binding sites and thus is unlikely to represent a molecular motor. Interestingly, we found that mapmodulin shares small segments of similarity with CLIP-170, the putative cytoplasmic linker between endosomes and microtubules (8Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 9Pierre P. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three of the four segments display 35–60% sequence identity and 53–80% similarity without introduction of any gaps or deletions (Fig. 4 B). The homologous segments reside within the amino-terminal region of mapmodulin and the carboxyl-terminal domain of CLIP-170, and their order and relative orientation is conserved between the two proteins. The highest level of identity (60%) was found between residues 145–154 of mapmodulin and residues 1313–1322 of CLIP-170, part of the putative organelle-binding domain of CLIP-170 (9Pierre P. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While this homology is intriguing, its true significance is at present, entirely unclear. Given the sequence similarity with CLIP-170, it was of interest to determine whether mapmodulin can link the Golgi to microtubules. For this purpose, we used an assay established by Kreis and co-workers (8Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 11Scheel J. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18141-18148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to detect CLIP-170-mediated, endosome-microtubule interactions. Taxol-stabilized bovine microtubules were incubated with KCl-treated Golgi membranes in the presence or absence of added CHO cytosol at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were then centrifuged through a sucrose cushion to separate free Golgi membranes from those that may have become microtubule-bound. The extent of Golgi binding was then quantified by measuring the level of Golgi-specific enzyme, N-acetylglucosamine transferase I, in the microtubule pellet. As shown in Table I, cytosol increased the association of KCl-treated Golgi with microtubules at least 7-fold. In contrast, CHO cell mapmodulin alone did not stimulate the association of KCl-treated Golgi with microtubules by more than a few percent. We estimate CHO cytosol to contain ∼50 ng of mapmodulin/100 μg, comparable with the amount tested in these experiments (64 ng). Thus, mapmodulin does not mediate the binding of Golgi complexes to microtubules under these experimental conditions, when added at concentrations similar to those found in cytosol. This feature distinguishes mapmodulin functionally from CLIP-170, which has been shown to mediate endosome-microtubule association under very similar conditions (8Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 11Scheel J. Kreis T.E. J. Biol.

The reaction mix (50 μl) was then layered onto a 40% sucrose cushion and spun at 35,000 rpm for 30 min at 25 °C in a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman). Resulting pellets were subjected to a GlcNAc transferase I assay to monitor Golgi association with microtubules. Open table in a new tab KCl-stripped Golgi complexes (6 μg) were incubated with 20 μg of taxol-stabilized microtubules and CHO cytosol (100 μg) or purified mapmodulin for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mix (50 μl) was then layered onto a 40% sucrose cushion and spun at 35,000 rpm for 30 min at 25 °C in a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman). Resulting pellets were subjected to a GlcNAc transferase I assay to monitor Golgi association with microtubules. Two-dimensional gel analyses of mapmodulin in CHO cytosol revealed that the protein is phosphorylated. As shown in Fig.5 A, antibodies raised against native CHO mapmodulin recognized one major and one minor spot on a two-dimensional gel immunoblot. When cytosol was treated with alkaline phosphatase, the bulk of the immunoreactivity shifted to the position of the slightly smaller, less acidic spot (panel B). Thus, the major form of mapmodulin is phosphorylated in CHO cytosol. Antibodies raised against the recombinant protein were much less effective in recognizing the phosphorylated form of mapmodulin. Only after phosphatase treatment of CHO cytosol did the antibody yield a significant reaction product (Fig. 5, C and D). It is very likely that the E. coli cells used for expression purposes lack the kinases responsible for mapmodulin phosphorylation. These experiments show that mapmodulin appears primarily as a phosphoprotein in CHO cytosol. It should be noted that a smaller (∼28 kDa), and more basic (pI = 4.4), immunoreactive spot was occasionally detected in some cytosol preparations. This form was only recognized by anti-recombinant mapmodulin antibodies. Since distinct splice variants of PHAPI have appeared in the data base, this spot may represent the product of a distinctly spliced mRNA. Since our previous MAP binding experiments were carried out with native, phosphorylated CHO mapmodulin (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining the potential importance of mapmodulin phosphorylation in terms of MAP binding. For this purpose, we used a solid phase immunoassay to compare the binding of phospho- and dephospho-mapmodulin to the microtubule binding, carboxyl-terminal domain of MAP4 (12Wang X.M. Peloquin J.G. Zhai Y. Bulinski J.C. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, nonphosphorylated, recombinant mapmodulin displayed only barely detectable binding to the carboxyl-terminal domain of MAP4, relative to that observed with the native form. When the same preparation of nonphosphorylated mapmodulin was boiled for 10 min, its MAP4 binding capacity was dramatically increased. These results suggest that mapmodulin phosphorylation allows this protein to assume a binding-competent conformation. Unfolding of the nonphosphorylated form of the protein by heat treatment appears to expose its MAP4 binding domain. The fact that a polyclonal antibody raised against the nonphosphorylated form of the protein only poorly recognizes the phosphorylated form is consistent with significant conformational differences between the two forms. Additional experiments will be needed to determine the nature of this conformational transformation. Direct dephosphorylation of phospho-mapmodulin would be predicted to eliminate its ability to bind MAPs. However, phosphatase treatment was not sufficient to block the MAP-binding capacity of mapmodulin (not shown). It is very possible that phosphatase treatment does not fully dephosphorylate mapmodulin; all we have shown is that at least partial dephosphorylation uncovers an epitope recognized by anti- dephospho-mapmodulin. Finally, it should be noted that heat treatment of carboxyl-terminal truncated mapmodulinΔC did not generate a molecule that could bind MAP4 (data not shown), reconfirming our previous conclusion that the acidic carboxyl terminus of mapmodulin is essential for MAP4 binding (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). During the course of our study, Li et al. (6Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 7Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) reported the purification of a ≥ 250 kDa potent and specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, which they named I1PP2A. Sequence analysis of this inhibitor revealed identity with PHAPI. This finding made it incumbent upon us to check whether native mapmodulin possessed phosphatase 2A-inhibitory activity. Phosphorylase a was used as a substrate, and CHO cytosol was used as the source of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. Fig.7 shows that commercial I1PP2A was a strong inhibitor of phosphatase 2A activity in CHO cytosol. In contrast, both native and recombinant mapmodulin failed to have any influence on phosphatase activity in this assay. This result was obtained with numerous cytosol and mapmodulin preparations. In summary, native mapmodulin, as purified by our published procedure, does not display phosphatase 2A inhibitory activity using phosphorylase a as substrate. It is important to note that unlike I1PP2A, which has an apparent M r of ≥ 250,000, native and recombinant mapmodulin/PHAPI chromatograph as ∼90-kDa species (Fig.2). This molecular distinction may in part explain the discrepancy between our results and those of Li et al. (7Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mapmodulin stimulates the microtubule and cytoplasmic dynein-dependent localization of Golgi complexes to the centrosomes of semi-intact Chinese hamster ovary cells (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In our efforts to understand how this protein stimulates Golgi localization, we found that mapmodulin binds the microtubule-associated proteins, MAP2, MAP4, and tau, via their homologous microtubule-binding domains (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We proposed that this property may allow mapmodulin to displace MAPs from the path of organelles translocating along microtubules toward the centrosome. In this paper, we have characterized the cellular localization and posttranslational modification of this novel, MAP-binding protein. By fractionation, the protein is predominantly cytosolic, but at least ∼5% can be shown to float in a sucrose gradient with endosome and Golgi-associated marker proteins. This was consistent with membrane localization determined by immunofluorescence light microscopy. Gel filtration experiments suggested that the cytosolic protein occurs as a trimer. In addition, two-dimensional gel analysis, carried out in conjunction with alkaline phosphatase treatment, confirmed that the major form of mapmodulin in CHO cytosol is phosphorylated. The primary structure of mapmodulin has two striking features. The carboxyl terminus is highly enriched in acidic residues, and the presence of this domain is required for MAP binding (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal portion contains a high proportion of leucine residues and a sequence that matches the consensus for a leucine-rich repeat. Leucine-rich repeats are relatively short motifs found in proteins of diverse function and localization. They appear to be able to form amphipathic structures with hydrophobic surfaces capable of interacting with other proteins. Since mapmodulin and carboxyl-terminal truncated mapmodulin apparently form trimers, it seems reasonable to propose that homo-oligomerization is mediated by the leucine-rich repeats. Here we have shown that mapmodulin phosphorylation is required for MAP binding. Although the kinases responsible for mapmodulin phosphorylation remain to be identified, multiple casein kinase II recognition motifs are present in the amino-terminal domain of the protein. Perhaps the amino-terminal portion interacts strongly with the carboxyl-terminal, MAP-binding domain in the nonphosphorylated state. Phosphorylation might loosen this interaction to permit mapmodulin-MAP interaction. Our finding that boiling of nonphosphorylated mapmodulin generates a protein that is competent for MAP binding is consistent with this hypothesis. Recombinant mapmodulin was active in our in vitro Golgi localization assay only when reactions were supplemented with additional cytosol (2Ulitzur N. Humbert M. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is likely that recombinant mapmodulin is rapidly phosphorylated by the residual cytosol present in our broken cells, converting it to an active conformation. Sequence analysis of mapmodulin revealed four consecutive stretches of homology between the carboxyl-terminal region of CLIP-170 and the amino-terminal region of mapmodulin. Pierre et al. (9Pierre P. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that the carboxyl-terminal domain appears to be involved in anchoring the protein to patches at the plasma membrane, while the conserved repeated motif present in the amino-terminal domain of CLIP-170 regulates its binding to microtubules in vivo. Future experiments will be needed to determine whether the CLIP-170-related portions of mapmodulin mediate membrane association. Despite sequence similarity with CLIP-170, mapmodulin does not appear to represent the key cytosolic factor responsible for direct Golgi binding to microtubules. Mapmodulin failed to enhance significantly the association of KCl-treated Golgi membranes with microtubules using a microtubule co-sedimentation assay. Under identical conditions, total CHO cytosol strongly stimulated microtubule co-sedimentation. A similar assay enabled Kreis and co-workers (8Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) to show that CLIP-170 linked endocytic carrier vesicles to microtubules. What is the significance of the identity of mapmodulin with PHAPI? At low ionic strength (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.6, 40 mmNaCl), PHAPI bound to the peptide KGLRKSNAAERRGPL but not to the peptide KAARKAAAAERRAAA; PHAPI was released by increasing the NaCl concentration above 160 mm (3Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Götz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmermann B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because of the charge similarity between the HLA-DR2α peptide and the corresponding control peptide, the authors concluded that the interaction showed sequence specificity beyond the general charge distribution of the lysine and arginine residues (3Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Götz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmermann B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although we cannot explain the physiological significance of PHAPI (mapmodulin) binding to the HLA-DR2α peptide, it is interesting to note that MAP proteins utilize a basic domain for interaction with microtubules (reviewed in Ref. 13Maccioni R.B. Cambiazo V. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 835-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). An example of this tubulin-binding sequence, which is repeated in MAP2 protein, KCGSLKNIRHRPGGG, shares remarkable compositional similarity with the test sequence employed to isolate PHAPI. The overall spacing of basic residues and the presence and relative distribution of the specific, bulky amino acids leucine, asparagine, and proline are strikingly conserved between the HLA-DR2α peptide and the tubulin binding domain of MAP2. Mapmodulin/PHAPI is likely the human homolog of a protein described as rat “leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein” (LANP; 83.6% amino acid identity; Refs. 4Matsuoka K. Taoka M. Satozawa N. Nakayama H.

Lichter P. Zimmer M. Genomics. 1995; 29: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). LANP was reported to be localized to the nuclei and cytoplasm of Purkinje cells. Our immunofluorescence analysis using affinity-purified antibodies and a variety of cell types did not reveal significant quantities of mapmodulin in the nucleus; mapmodulin was predominantly in the cytosol and on Golgi and ER membranes. It remains possible that our antibody recognizes a different phosphorylated form of mapmodulin than that studied in this report. Chen et al. (5Chen T.-H. Brody J.R. Romantsev F.E. Yu J.-G.

This protein was previously identified as a phosphoprotein that is highly expressed in cancer tissues and self-renewing cell populations. Our data confirm the conclusion that PHAPI is a phosphoprotein in CHO cells. Li et al. (6Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 7Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) purified and cloned a potent and specific protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor, I1PP2A, which they later found to be identical to PHAPI. In the present study, we confirmed that commercial I1PP2A is a potent phosphatase inhibitor. However, we were unable to detect any phosphatase inhibitory activity in preparations of either native or recombinant mapmodulin. It is important to note that the purification procedure of both bovine kidney and E. coli-purified I1PP2A includes poly(l-lysine)-agarose and elution with high salt (6Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 7Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Moreover, I1PP2Awas reported to elute from a gel filtration column as a ≥ 250 kDa form, rather than the native ∼90 kDa trimeric form of mapmodulin/PHAPI (this study). Li et al. (6Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 7Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) stated that differences in protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor activity in the extracts from control and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-treated cells could not be distinguished prior to chromatography on poly(l-lysine)-agarose. These results imply that I1PP2A may be active in an aggregated form. We have shown that the native form of PHAPI/mapmodulin is not active as a phosphatase inhibitor. However, it remains entirely plausible that under certain conditions in living cells, the potential of mapmodulin to act as a phosphatase inhibitor is in some way unmasked. We discovered mapmodulin based on its ability to stimulate the microtubule-dependent and cytoplasmic dynein-dependent localization of Golgi complexes in eukaryotic cells. This protein has a number of interesting biochemical features, including regulation by phosphorylation-induced conformational changes and MAP-binding capacity. A future challenge will be to elucidate further the biological roles of the mapmodulin/PHAPI phosphoprotein in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015482361,"By direct sequencing of cosmids using primers designed from the known cDNA sequence, we identified 19 exons in the human MET proto-oncogene, and sequenced the corresponding 5' and 3' exon-intron junctions. By homology search in the database of the Washington University Genome Sequence Center (GSC), we identified one additional exon. These 20 exons, together with a previously reported exon, bring the total exon number of MET to 21. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify each exon and adjacent intronic sequences to permit examination of each exon for mutations. By restriction mapping, we assembled a 110 kb genomic contig that covered almost the entire MET proto-oncogene. This information is relevant for the screening of recently reported mutations of the MET gene which cause hereditary papillary renal carcinomas and for the search for additional mutations of the same gene which may play a role in the pathogenesis of common human carcinomas including carcinomas of the breast, ovary and pancreas."

Amino acids are actively transported into plant cells by proton-coupled symporters (1Bush D.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 513-542Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). These proteins link translocation across the plasma membrane to the proton-motive force generated by a P-type, H+-ATPase (2Briskin D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 95-109Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3Serrano R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 61-94Crossref Google Scholar). In plants, there are many heterotrophic tissue systems that are dependent upon carbon and nitrogen import for growth and development. Since amino acids are the primary form of nitrogen available to the heterotrophic plant tissues, the amino acid symporters are responsible for the systemic distribution of organic nitrogen, and therefore, they are essential contributors to plant growth (4Pate J.S. Stewart F.C. Bidwell R.G.S. Plant Physiology: A Treatise, Vol. VIII: Nitrogen Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1983: 335-401Google Scholar, 5Bush D.R. Singh B. Plant Amino Acids: Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Marcel Dekker, NY1998Google Scholar). Detailed investigations of the transport properties and bioenergetics of these symporters using isolated plasma membrane vesicles and imposed proton electrochemical potential differences have shown that they are electrogenic transporters that are driven by either transmembrane proton or electrical potential differences (6Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These transporters are inhibited by chemical modification of histidine residues by diethyl pyrocarbonate (6Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and substrate protection experiments suggest the sensitive residue is at or near the substrate binding site (5Bush D.R. Singh B. Plant Amino Acids: Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Marcel Dekker, NY1998Google Scholar, 7Bush D.R. Li Z.-C. Bonnemain J.L. Delrot S. Lucas W.J. Dainty J. Recent Advances in Phloem Transport and Assimilate Compartmentation. Presses Academiques, France1991: 148-153Google Scholar). Several classes of symporters were initially resolved based on expression patterns and substrate specificity (6Li Z.-C. Bush D.R.

Transport competition experiments showed that binding sites are stereo-specific and identified the carboxylic acid, the alpha amino group, and substitutions at the β-carbon as important determinants in governing substrate binding (8Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1338-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, one of these symporters was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and electrophysiological methods allowed for a high resolution investigation of transport kinetics that suggests these transporters operate by a simultaneous binding mechanism (12Boorer K.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2213-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The first plant amino acid symporter cloned (NAT2/AAP1) was identified by two groups using functional complementation of yeast amino acid transport mutants with different Arabidopsis cDNA expression libraries (13Hsu L.-C.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded protein contains 485 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 52.9 kDa and three sites of potentialN-linked glycosylation. Hydropathy analysis suggested this is an integral membrane protein with 10–12 membrane-spanning regions. A search of the non-redundant protein data bases did not identify any strong homologies, suggesting NAT2/AAP1 represented a new class of transport protein (13Hsu L.-C. Chiou T.-J. Chen L. Bush D.R.

Caspari T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 595-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These include five clones that are closely related to NAT2/AAP1 (AAP2–6) (16Kwart M. Hirner B. Hummel S. Frommer W.B.

Plant Physiology. 1997; 115: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Most of the plant amino acid transporters have relatively broad substrate specificity although they often exhibit some preference (lowerK m or higher V max) for related groups of amino acids. The presence of multiple genes coding for amino acid carriers suggests there is considerable complexity in the function of these transporters in nitrogen allocation in plants (21Bush D.R. Chiou T.-J. Chen L. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Despite the physiological importance of amino acid transporters in plant growth, little is known about these transport proteins at the molecular level. This deficiency is a result of the difficulty of working with low abundance membrane proteins and the apparent toxicity of these eukaryotic membrane proteins expressed in E. coli. 1T.-J. Chiou and D. R. Bush, unpublished data. 1T.-J. Chiou and D. R. Bush, unpublished data. To learn more about the molecular structure and function of plant amino acid symporters, our laboratory has chosen NAT2/AAP1 as a prototypical example for detailed analysis. We chose this symporter because it is a member of a large family of translocators, because it transports amino acids that are commonly found in the phloem translocation stream, and also because it is widely expressed in plant tissues, suggesting it plays an important role in nitrogen partitioning. In the results reported here, we have investigated the topology of NAT2 in the plasma membrane as an important first step in describing plant amino acid symporters at the molecular level. We determined its membrane topology by engineering a c-myc epitope onto the N or C terminus, and then we expressed the chimeric proteins in a cell-free translation system, in yeast, and in COS-1 cells.DISCUSSIONIn the results presented here, we showed that the N terminus of NAT2/AAP1 is on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, and the C terminus faces outside the cell. This conclusion was supported by the differential sensitivity to proteolysis by the N- and C-terminally tagged NAT2 proteins and by immunofluorescent localization of epitope-tagged NAT2 in COS-1 cells. In addition, partial proteolysis of the in vitro translated C-terminal tagged protein produced six immunoprecipitable peptide fragments, suggesting NAT2 has six protein domains that are accessible to proteinase K. An 11-TMD model of NAT2 is proposed based on the number and size of the proteolytic fragments, predictions derived from hydropathy analysis, the absence of protein glycosylation, and localization of the N and C termini of NAT2 on opposite sides of the plasma membrane. Taken together, we believe these data provide good evidence that NAT2 contains 11 TMD.The novel 11 transmembrane domain model we propose here is different from the well-known model of the major facilitator superfamily that contains a common structural motif of 12 transmembrane segments with cytoplasmic N and C termini (34Griffith J.K.

NAT2 is also unique when compared with the cotransporter family of fungal and bacterial amino acid transporters, which show significant sequence similarity across the prokaryotic-eukaryotic boundary (40Sophianopoulou V.

The amino acid carriers in this family exhibit very similar hydrophobic profiles that are predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains (40Sophianopoulou V. Diallinas G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 53-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Andre B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1575-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Indeed, the topology of lysP inE. coli was shown by gene-fusion analysis to have 12 transmembrane domains (50Ellis J. Carlin A. Steffes C. Wu J. Liu J. Rosen B.P. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The distantly related amino acid transporters of animals, such as the family of Na+-dependent amino acid neurotransmitters (51Clark J.A. Amara S.G.

Dechant E. North R.A. Kabat D. J. Biol.

The C terminus of several transport proteins has been implicated in regulating transport activity (53Dauterive R. Laroux S. Bunn R.C. Chaisson A. Sanson T. Reed B.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28400-28404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a C-terminal deletion of NAT2/AAP1 increases transport activity of this porter. 3L. Chen and D. R. Bush, unpublished data. Although the reason for this stimulation is still under investigation, this observation suggests that the C terminus may play an important role in transport function. Since the C terminus of NAT2/AAP1 is localized on the outside face of the plasma membrane, this observation also raises the possibility that this carrier could be regulated by extra-cellular factors. NAT2 is also unique when compared with otherArabidopsis amino acid transporters such as ProT1, ProT2 (proline transporter; Ref. 18Rentsch D. Hirner B. Schmelzer E. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and AAT1 (cationic amino acid transporter; Ref. 19Frommer W.B. Hummel S. Unseld M. Ninnemann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12036-12040Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). So far, the 11-transmembrane topology is specific to the Arabidopsis AAP family.An alignment of the hydropathy profile of the AAP family members shows that they are super-imposable (32Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16996) Google Scholar). This observation supports our focus on NAT2 as a prototypical example of this family. Interestingly, there is a hyper-variable region between TMD5 and TMD6 of the alignment. According to the topology model, this region is oriented to the outside of the cell. This observation raises the interesting hypothesis that this loop may be involved in defining substrate specificity. When we compare the amino acid sequences in this region, some members contain similar numbers of charged amino acid residues. For example, AAP2 and AAP4 have three basic amino acid residues, and they transport the same group of amino acids. Likewise, AAP3 and AAP5 share significant similarities in both charge and substrate patterns (17Fischer W.-N. Kwart M. Hummel S. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16315-16320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Rentsch D. Hirner B. Schmelzer E. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The importance of these observations will require additional investigations.As a growing number of amino acid transporters are identified in higher plants, it becomes increasingly important to define the molecular characteristics of these amino acid transporters in the context of nitrogen allocation across the plant as a multicellular organism. The topology of NAT2/AAP1 described here is the foundation of future investigations of the structure and function of theArabidopsis AAP family. Amino acids are actively transported into plant cells by proton-coupled symporters (1Bush D.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 513-542Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). These proteins link translocation across the plasma membrane to the proton-motive force generated by a P-type, H+-ATPase (2Briskin D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 95-109Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3Serrano R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 61-94Crossref Google Scholar). In plants, there are many heterotrophic tissue systems that are dependent upon carbon and nitrogen import for growth and development. Since amino acids are the primary form of nitrogen available to the heterotrophic plant tissues, the amino acid symporters are responsible for the systemic distribution of organic nitrogen, and therefore, they are essential contributors to plant growth (4Pate J.S. Stewart F.C. Bidwell R.G.S. Plant Physiology: A Treatise, Vol. VIII: Nitrogen Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1983: 335-401Google Scholar, 5Bush D.R. Singh B. Plant Amino Acids: Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Marcel Dekker, NY1998Google Scholar). Detailed investigations of the transport properties and bioenergetics of these symporters using isolated plasma membrane vesicles and imposed proton electrochemical potential differences have shown that they are electrogenic transporters that are driven by either transmembrane proton or electrical potential differences (6Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These transporters are inhibited by chemical modification of histidine residues by diethyl pyrocarbonate (6Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and substrate protection experiments suggest the sensitive residue is at or near the substrate binding site (5Bush D.R. Singh B. Plant Amino Acids: Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Marcel Dekker, NY1998Google Scholar, 7Bush D.R. Li Z.-C. Bonnemain J.L. Delrot S. Lucas W.J. Dainty J. Recent Advances in Phloem Transport and Assimilate Compartmentation. Presses Academiques, France1991: 148-153Google Scholar). Several classes of symporters were initially resolved based on expression patterns and substrate specificity (6Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,8Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1338-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Arch.

Transport competition experiments showed that binding sites are stereo-specific and identified the carboxylic acid, the alpha amino group, and substitutions at the β-carbon as important determinants in governing substrate binding (8Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1338-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Li Z.-C. Bush D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, one of these symporters was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and electrophysiological methods allowed for a high resolution investigation of transport kinetics that suggests these transporters operate by a simultaneous binding mechanism (12Boorer K.J. Frommer W.B. Bush D.R. Kreman M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2213-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The first plant amino acid symporter cloned (NAT2/AAP1) was identified by two groups using functional complementation of yeast amino acid transport mutants with different Arabidopsis cDNA expression libraries (13Hsu L.-C. Chiou T.-J. Chen L. Bush D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7441-7445Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Frommer W.B. Hummel S. Riesmeier J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5944-5948Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded protein contains 485 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 52.9 kDa and three sites of potentialN-linked glycosylation. Hydropathy analysis suggested this is an integral membrane protein with 10–12 membrane-spanning regions. A search of the non-redundant protein data bases did not identify any strong homologies, suggesting NAT2/AAP1 represented a new class of transport protein (13Hsu L.-C. Chiou T.-J. Chen L. Bush D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7441-7445Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Several amino acid transporter genes have now been isolated fromArabidopsis using functional complementation of yeast transport mutants (15Tanner W. Caspari T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 595-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These include five clones that are closely related to NAT2/AAP1 (AAP2–6) (16Kwart M. Hirner B. Hummel S. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 1993; 4: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Fischer W.-N. Kwart M. Hummel S. Frommer W.B. J. Biol.

Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), a cationic amino acid transporter (AAT1) (19Frommer W.B. Hummel S. Unseld M. Ninnemann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12036-12040Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), two proline transporters (ProT1 and ProT2) (18Rentsch D. Hirner B. Schmelzer E. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and a lysine and histidine transporter (LHT1) (20Chen L. Bush D.R. Plant Physiology. 1997; 115: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Most of the plant amino acid transporters have relatively broad substrate specificity although they often exhibit some preference (lowerK m or higher V max) for related groups of amino acids. The presence of multiple genes coding for amino acid carriers suggests there is considerable complexity in the function of these transporters in nitrogen allocation in plants (21Bush D.R. Chiou T.-J. Chen L. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the physiological importance of amino acid transporters in plant growth, little is known about these transport proteins at the molecular level. This deficiency is a result of the difficulty of working with low abundance membrane proteins and the apparent toxicity of these eukaryotic membrane proteins expressed in E. coli. 1T.-J. Chiou and D. R. Bush, unpublished data. 1T.-J. Chiou and D. R. Bush, unpublished data. To learn more about the molecular structure and function of plant amino acid symporters, our laboratory has chosen NAT2/AAP1 as a prototypical example for detailed analysis. We chose this symporter because it is a member of a large family of translocators, because it transports amino acids that are commonly found in the phloem translocation stream, and also because it is widely expressed in plant tissues, suggesting it plays an important role in nitrogen partitioning. In the results reported here, we have investigated the topology of NAT2 in the plasma membrane as an important first step in describing plant amino acid symporters at the molecular level. We determined its membrane topology by engineering a c-myc epitope onto the N or C terminus, and then we expressed the chimeric proteins in a cell-free translation system, in yeast, and in COS-1 cells. DISCUSSIONIn the results presented here, we showed that the N terminus of NAT2/AAP1 is on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, and the C terminus faces outside the cell. This conclusion was supported by the differential sensitivity to proteolysis by the N- and C-terminally tagged NAT2 proteins and by immunofluorescent localization of epitope-tagged NAT2 in COS-1 cells. In addition, partial proteolysis of the in vitro translated C-terminal tagged protein produced six immunoprecipitable peptide fragments, suggesting NAT2 has six protein domains that are accessible to proteinase K. An 11-TMD model of NAT2 is proposed based on the number and size of the proteolytic fragments, predictions derived from hydropathy analysis, the absence of protein glycosylation, and localization of the N and C termini of NAT2 on opposite sides of the plasma membrane. Taken together, we believe these data provide good evidence that NAT2 contains 11 TMD.The novel 11 transmembrane domain model we propose here is different from the well-known model of the major facilitator superfamily that contains a common structural motif of 12 transmembrane segments with cytoplasmic N and C termini (34Griffith J.K.

This superfamily contains many plasma membrane transport systems identified in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Major facilitator superfamily members function as uniporters, symporters, and antiporters for a variety of organic and inorganic substrates (34Griffith J.K. Baker M.E. Rouch D.A. Page M.G.P.

NAT2 is also unique when compared with the cotransporter family of fungal and bacterial amino acid transporters, which show significant sequence similarity across the prokaryotic-eukaryotic boundary (40Sophianopoulou V.

The amino acid carriers in this family exhibit very similar hydrophobic profiles that are predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains (40Sophianopoulou V. Diallinas G. FEMS Microbiol.

Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and AAT1 (cationic amino acid transporter; Ref. 19Frommer W.B. Hummel S. Unseld M. Ninnemann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12036-12040Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). So far, the 11-transmembrane topology is specific to the Arabidopsis AAP family. An alignment of the hydropathy profile of the AAP family members shows that they are super-imposable (32Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16996) Google Scholar). This observation supports our focus on NAT2 as a prototypical example of this family. Interestingly, there is a hyper-variable region between TMD5 and TMD6 of the alignment. According to the topology model, this region is oriented to the outside of the cell. This observation raises the interesting hypothesis that this loop may be involved in defining substrate specificity. When we compare the amino acid sequences in this region, some members contain similar numbers of charged amino acid residues. For example, AAP2 and AAP4 have three basic amino acid residues, and they transport the same group of amino acids. Likewise, AAP3 and AAP5 share significant similarities in both charge and substrate patterns (17Fischer W.-N. Kwart M. Hummel S. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16315-16320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Rentsch D. Hirner B. Schmelzer E. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The importance of these observations will require additional investigations. As a growing number of amino acid transporters are identified in higher plants, it becomes increasingly important to define the molecular characteristics of these amino acid transporters in the context of nitrogen allocation across the plant as a multicellular organism. The topology of NAT2/AAP1 described here is the foundation of future investigations of the structure and function of theArabidopsis AAP family. We thank Dr. N. V.

https://openalex.org/W2011720898,"Plasma concentrations of the atherogenic lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) are predominantly determined by inherited sequences within or closely linked to the apolipoprotein(a) gene locus. Much of the interindividual variability in Lp(a) levels is likely to originate at the level of apo(a) gene transcription. However, the liver-specific apo(a) basal promoter is extremely weak and does not exhibit common functional variations that affect plasma Lp(a) concentrations. In a search for additional apo(a) gene control elements, we have identified two fragments with enhancer activity within the 40-kilobase pair apo(a)-plasminogen intergenic region that coincide with DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHII and DHIII) observed in liver chromatin of mice expressing a human apo(a) transgene. Neither enhancer exhibits tissue specificity. DHIII activity was mapped to a 600-base pair fragment containing nine DNase I-protected elements (footprints) that stimulates luciferase expression from the apo(a) promoter 10–15-fold in HepG2 cells. Binding of the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 plays a major role in the function of this enhancer, but no single site was indispensable for activity. DHIII comprises part of the regulatory region of an inactive long interspersed nucleotide element 1 retrotransposon, raising the possibility that retrotransposon insertion can influence the regulation of adjacent genes. DHII enhancer activity was localized to a 180-base pair fragment that stimulates transcription from the apo(a) promoter 4–8-fold in HepG2 cells. Mutations within an Sp1 site or either of two elements composed of direct repeats of the nuclear hormone receptor half-site AGGTCA in this sequence completely abolished enhancer function. Both nuclear hormone receptor elements were shown to bind peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and other members of the nuclear receptor family, suggesting that this enhancer may mediate drug and hormone responsiveness.

Nature. 1987; 339: 301-303Google Scholar) and forms the characteristic protein constituent of the atherogenic lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). Many clinical studies have shown that high Lp(a) concentrations in plasma are associated with an increased incidence of arterial disease (2Rhoads G.G. Dahlen G. Berg K. Morton N.E. Dannenberg A.L. J.

Assoc. 1994; 271: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The most recent prospective study reported that men whose Lp(a) concentration exceeded 35 nmol/liter had a nearly 3-fold greater risk of developing coronary artery disease (5Wild S.H. Fortmann S.P. Marcovina S.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice that express human apo(a) show an increased propensity to develop fatty streak lesions when fed a high fat diet, which suggests that the protein may play a direct role in atherogenesis (6Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Hammer R.E. Chiesa G. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Apo(a) is synthesized in the liver (7Tomlinson J.E. McLean J.W. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5957-5965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kraft H.G. Menzel H.J. Hoppichler F. Vogel W. Utermann G. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and Lp(a) is probably formed by the covalent attachment of apo(a) to the apoB100 moiety of an LDL-like particle at the hepatocyte surface (9White A.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28716-28723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, interindividual plasma Lp(a) concentrations vary very widely, spanning a range from ∼0.1 to more than 200 mg/dl (10Gaubatz J.W. Cushing G.L. Morrisett J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Perombelon Y.F.N. Soutar A.K. Knight B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1481-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Lp(a) concentrations are predominantly genetically determined (12Hasstedt S.J. Williams R.R. Genet. Epidemiol. 1986; 3: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Utermann G. Menzel H.J. Kraft H.G. Duba H.C. Kemmler H.G. Seitz C. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), and at least 90% of the variation in plasma concentration is attributable to inherited sequences within or closely linked to the apo(a) gene locus itself (14Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Lin J. Lackner C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the sequence variations responsible and the mechanisms by which they affect Lp(a) levels are not yet fully understood. The apo(a) gene exhibits extreme size polymorphism as a result of the presence of a hypervariable region that may contain between 12 and 51 tandem repeats of a sequence similar to kringle four of plasminogen (15Lackner C. Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Rahmig T. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 2153-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A general inverse relationship exists between the number of kringle four repeats and plasma Lp(a) levels (13Utermann G. Menzel H.J. Kraft H.G. Duba H.C. Kemmler H.G. Seitz C. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), suggesting that apo(a) gene size partly determines the amount of circulating Lp(a). This relationship is likely to result from post-translational processes, since it has been shown that the residence time of immature apo(a) proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and, consequently, their availability for incorporation into lipoproteins are inversely related to protein isoform size (16White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, identically sized apo(a) isoforms may be associated with up to 200-fold variations in apo(a) levels in plasma, suggesting that the apo(a) locus influences Lp(a) concentration through a mechanism that is independent of apo(a) gene size (11Perombelon Y.F.N. Soutar A.K. Knight B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1481-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Cohen J.C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1630-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is likely that much of this influence occurs at the level of transcription, since hepatic apo(a) mRNA abundance differs markedly between individuals in both primate and human populations (18Hixson J.E. Britten M.L. Manis G.S. Rainwater D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6013-6016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Koschinsky M.L. Beisiegel U. Henne-Brunns D. Eaton D.L. Lawn R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Wade D.P. Knight B.L. Harders-Spengel K. Soutar A.K. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 91: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and apo(a) mRNA concentration has been shown to correlate with Lp(a) levels in cynomolgus monkeys (21Azrolan N. Gavish D. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An understanding of the mechanisms that control transcription of the apo(a) gene is therefore important. In a previous study, the minimal apo(a) promoter was mapped by deletion analysis, and basal transcription of the apo(a) gene was shown to be dependent on the binding of the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-1α to a site in the untranslated region of the promoter (22Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since HNF-1α expression is limited to the liver and a few other tissues (23Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 677-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this feature of the apo(a) promoter partly accounts for the liver specificity of transcription of the apo(a) gene. However the apo(a) promoter is extremely weak, directing only a very low level of basal transcription in transiently transfected HepG2 cells (22Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of studies have failed to reveal functional polymorphisms in the apo(a) promoter of a magnitude that might account for the apo(a) allele size-independent variation in apo(a) concentrations (24Zysow B.R. Lindahl G.E. Wade D.P. Knight B.L. Lawn R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Bopp S Kochl S. Acquati F. Magnaghi P. Petho-Schramm A.

Invest. 1997; 99: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that optimal transcription of the apo(a) gene, like that of many genes might depend on the presence of one or more enhancer regions at some distance from the basal promoter. Therefore, to gain a greater understanding of the factors that control expression of the apo(a) gene and to identify regions that might harbor functional variations that affect apo(a) synthesis, we began to look for additional apo(a) gene regulatory elements. We focused our search on the 40-kb sequence between the apo(a) and plasminogen gene, since several hepatoma cell-specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites have been detected in this region (27Magnaghi P. Mihalich A. Taramelli R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and such sites indicate an open chromatin conformation, which is often associated with active regulatory regions (28Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 29Fedor M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of two enhancers upstream of the apo(a) gene and the characterization by site-directed mutagenesis, DNase I footprinting, and gel mobility shift assays of the cis-elements andtrans-acting factors most critical for their function. Plasmid GL3F, consisting of bases −98 to +130 of the apo(a) 5′-flanking region fused upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL3-basic (Promega), was constructed by ligation of an XhoI-SacI fragment of p(−98)GLA1 (22Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pGL3-basic digested with XhoI and SacI. Fragments of the apo(a)-plasminogen intergenic region were subcloned into aKpnI site immediately upstream of the apo(a) promoter insert in pGL3F. A region spanning DNase-hypersensitive site IV (Fig. 1) (27Magnaghi P. Mihalich A. Taramelli R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) consisting of ∼3 kb of sequence immediately upstream of the previously cloned 1.4-kb apo(a) gene 5′-flanking region (30Wade D.P. Clarke J.G. Lindahl G.E. Liu A.C. Zysow B.R. Meer K. Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was amplified from genomic DNA using the PromoterFinder DNA Walking Kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, libraries of purified genomic DNA fragments ligated to adaptor linkers were amplified with a primer complementary to the adaptors and a primer (5′-TGACAGAGCAAGAATGTCTCAGGAAAG-3′) complementary to nucleotides −858 to −832 (relative to the start site of transcription) of the apo(a) 5′-flanking sequence (30Wade D.P. Clarke J.G. Lindahl G.E. Liu A.C. Zysow B.R. Meer K. Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Products were subjected to a second amplification with a nested primer complementary to the adaptors and a primer complementary to nucleotides −1226 to −1197 of the apo(a) 5′-flanking sequence (5′-CGTCAGTGCACTTCAACCGGGGTGAGAGTC-3′). After cloning into T-vector (Promega) the identity of the 3-kb product was verified by dideoxy sequencing. The product was excised from the T-vector as an NsiI-SphI fragment and ligated into KpnI-digested pGL3F after the cohesive ends of both vector and insert were blunted with Klenow enzyme. Consecutive fragments comprising a further 28 kb of the intergenic region were excised from cosmid 2B (27Magnaghi P. Mihalich A. Taramelli R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) by digestion with KpnI, isolated from agarose gels, and subcloned into the KpnI site of pGL3F. Fragments representing the 5′ and 3′ termini of the cosmid clone (9.0 and 2.1 in Fig. 1) were ligated first into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) to provide an additional polylinker-derivedKpnI site for subcloning. Nested deletion mutants of the 1.8- and 2.0-kb KpnI subclones in GL3F (pGL3F1.8K and pGL3F2K, Fig. 3) were synthesized by digestion with Exonuclease III and Mung Bean nuclease (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The enhancer core region of the 1.8-kb fragment (bases −1796 to −1215, 3′ terminus of each fragment designated as −1; see Fig. 3) was excised from deletion mutant p(−1215)GL3F1.8K by digestion with XbaI and KpnI for ligation upstream of heterologous promoters. After blunting with Klenow enzyme, the fragment was subcloned into the EcoICRI site of pGL3F and pGL3 promoter (a luciferase reporter construct driven by the SV40 promoter (Promega)) and the SmaI site of pLDLRGL3 (a luciferase reporter construct driven by the LDL receptor gene promoter (31Sun X.-M. Neuwirth C. Wade D.P. Knight B.L. Soutar A.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2125-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). Corresponding constructs were made with aPvuII-EcoICRI restriction fragment of the 2.0-kb enhancer (bases −1 to −618) that contained the enhancer core region (bases −1 to −186). The orientation of the inserts was verified by restriction digestion. Site-directed mutants of sequences within regions protected from DNase I digestion by the binding of nuclear proteins (Fig. 6) were synthesized using the Unique Site Elimination Mutagenesis kit (Pharmacia) as described (22Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All mutated fragments were sequenced and subcloned into parent vectors that had not undergone the mutagenesis procedure. A deletion mutant of p(−1215)GL3F1.8K lacking the region containing footprint J (Fig. 6 A) was constructed by removal of bases −1796 to −1697 from p(−1215)GL3F1.8K by digestion with KpnI and AvaI and religation of the remaining vector after blunting with Klenow enzyme. To construct a deletion mutant lacking the region of footprint B (Fig. 6 A), p(−1158)GL3F1.8K was digested with PvuII, removing bases −1197 to −1156, and the parent vector was circularized with T4 DNA ligase.Figure 3Deletion analysis of the 1.8-kb and 2.0-kb enhancer fragments.

Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described by Wade et al. (22Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the binding buffer contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 66.6 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 10% (v/v) glycerol. When binding reactions were performed with recombinant Sp1 (Promega), poly(dI-dC) was omitted from the buffer. Antiserum to Sp1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and antiserum to PPARα and PPARγ was from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. Sites of hypersensitivity to DNase I digestion in mouse liver chromatin were detected as described by Magnaghi et al. (27Magnaghi P. Mihalich A. Taramelli R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The presence of a number of HepG2-specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites in sequences between the apo(a) and plasminogen genes (27Magnaghi P. Mihalich A. Taramelli R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) suggested that this region may be of importance in the transcriptional regulation of the liver-specific apo(a) gene. We therefore investigated whether elements in the apo(a)-plasminogen intergenic region could affect the expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the apo(a) minimal promoter region (positions −98 to +130 relative to the cap site) (22Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs containing consecutive fragments of the apo(a)-plasminogen intergenic region extending from the previously cloned 1.4-kb 5′-flanking region (30Wade D.P. Clarke J.G. Lindahl G.E. Liu A.C. Zysow B.R. Meer K. Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) to approximately 31 kb upstream of the apo(a) gene cap site were synthesized and assayed for luciferase expression in transiently transfected HepG2 cells (Fig.1). One fragment (9.0-kb fragment, Fig.1 C) consistently repressed expression of the reporter gene to ∼20% of control values, a result not likely to be due to a methodological artifact related to its length, since no repression was observed with the comparably sized 7.0-kb fragment. This region may therefore contain negative regulatory elements. Two discreteKpnI fragments enhanced luciferase expression from the apo(a) promoter ∼4-fold (1.8- and 2.0-kb fragments, Fig.1 C). When cloned in reverse orientation, the 1.8-kb fragment retained its ability to stimulate transcription, showing the orientation independence characteristic of enhancers, while the 2.0-kb fragment did not (Fig. 1 C). However, the 2.0-kb fragment could not drive transcription of the luciferase reporter gene in the absence of the apo(a) minimal promoter (results not shown), suggesting that it is not itself a promoter, and the core region of this fragment was subsequently shown to exhibit enhancer-like orientation-independent activity (see below). We examined chromatin isolated from the livers of transgenic mice containing stably integrated copies of a YAC clone spanning the apo(a) gene and including the complete apo(a)-plasminogen intergenic region. 2H-J. Muller and F. Acquati, manuscript in preparation. These mice transcribe the apo(a) gene at high levels in a liver-specific manner,2 suggesting that the regulatory regions necessary for appropriate apo(a) gene expression are present in the integrated sequences. Figs. 1 and 2 show that DNase I-hypersensitive sites DHII and DHIII are detectable in the apo(a)-plasminogen intergenic region in positions coincident with the sequences we have identified as having enhancer activity. These sites are not detectable in chromatin isolated from kidney or brain of the transgenic mice (results not shown). To map the positions of functional regulatory elements within the 1.8- and 2.0-kbKpnI fragments, a series of deletion mutants of each fragment was constructed as shown in Fig.3. Deletion of sequences from −1 to −1215 of the 1.8-kb fragment (the first base of the KpnI site at the 3′-end of each fragment is designated −1) resulted in a ∼5-fold increase in enhancer activity (Fig. 3 A), indicating the presence of negative regulatory elements or interfering sequences in this region. Further deletions down to position −1517 reduced enhancer activity in a stepwise manner to zero, suggesting that all the elements necessary for maximal enhancer activity are present in the region between positions −1517 and −1215. However, a −1506 to −1215 NheI-XbaI fragment excised from deletion construct p(−1215)GL3FK1.8, which includes all of the nuclear protein binding sites that were subsequently detected between positions −1517 and −1215 (see below),"
https://openalex.org/W2331990033,"Tyrosine autophosphorylation of the v-Fms oncogene product results in the formation of high-affinity binding sites for cellular proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. These proteins transduce various mitogenic and morphogenic signals. As reported previously, Y696KNI in the kinase insert domain of v-Fms binds to the growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2), a stimulator of the Ras/Raf1 pathway. Here, we mapped Y921TNL within the C-terminal domain of Fms as a novel autophosphorylation site. We demonstrate that this site constitutes a second Grb2 binding site: a recombinant fusion protein (residues 904 – 944) containing phosphorylated Y921 bound Grb2 from FDCP-1Mac11 cell extracts significantly more efficiently than a corresponding protein (residues 617 – 759) containing Y696. A yeast two-hybrid system which allowed the formation of a functional Fms tyrosine kinase was employed to quantify binding of Grb2. Fms-protein containing either one of the two phosphorylation sites bound Grb2 equally well, binding was increased for proteins carrying both sites. In contrast, the simultaneous substitution of Y696 and Y921 by phenylalanines abolished Grb2 binding. Mouse NIH3T3 cells expressing the Y921F mutant Fms-protein showed a substantially higher content of fibronectin network than wild-type transformed cells and had largely lost their serum independent growth phenotype."

Wild-type and mutated versions of HGFL were produced after transfection of the corresponding cDNAs into tissue culture cells. The biological importance of the domains within HGFL was then examined by addition of recombinant wild-type or mutant forms of HGFL to assays aimed at elucidating regions involved in the stimulation of DNA synthesis, the induction of shape changes in macrophages, and the ability to stimulate cell scattering. Mutant proteins lacking the serine protease-like domain (light chain) were not biologically active in any of the assays tested and could not compete with wild-type HGFL in cell scattering experiments. These data, in addition to direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses, suggest that the light chain may play an important role in the interaction of HGFL with its receptor, Ron. Elimination of the proposed protease cleavage site between the heavy and light chains (by mutation of Arg-483 to Glu) produced a protein with activity comparable to wild-type HGFL. Further studies with this mutated protein uncovered an additional proteolytic cleavage site that produces biologically active protein.

HGFL has been shown to be synthesized as a single polypeptide chain that is proteolytically cleaved to an active disulfide-linked heterodimer. The large α or heavy chain encodes an amino-terminal hairpin loop structure, homologous to the preactivation peptide in plasminogen, and four kringle domains. Kringle domains are triple disulfide-bonded loop structures composed of approximately 80 amino acids that are thought to be important in protein:protein interactions. The small β or light chain contains a serine protease-like domain in which the three active site amino acids have been changed such that protease activity is unlikely. The cDNA for HGFL codes for a protein of approximately 80 kDa containing 711 amino acids and three potential N-linked carbohydrate addition sites (1Han S. Stuart L.A. Degen S.J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9768-9780Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the exact size of the two chains of HGFL as determined by Western analysis has been placed at anywhere from 45 kDa to 62 kDa for the heavy chain and approximately 25–35 kDa for the light chain (6Bezerra J.A. Laney Jr., D.W. Degen S.J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Bezerra J.A. Han S. Danton M.J.S. Degen S.J.F.

Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). HGFL has been classified in the same growth factor family as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), with both proteins having a strikingly similar domain structure composed of the NH2-terminal hairpin loop, four kringle domains, and a serine protease-like domain. Because of this similarity, HGFL is thought to elicit a broad range of functions as has been determined for HGF. However, in contrast to the wide expression patterns of HGF, HGFL has been shown to be produced primarily by liver hepatocytes (9Bezerra J.A. Witte D.P. Aronow B.M. Degen S.J.F. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 394-399PubMed Google Scholar). To date, several functions for HGFL have been determined, including the ability to stimulate mouse resident peritoneal macrophage (4Leonard E. Skeel A. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 114: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), to induce cellular proliferation (10Gaudino G. Follenzi A. Naldini L. Collesi C. Santoro M. Gallo K.A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), to induce cell motility (13Santoro M.M. Collesi C. Grisendi S. Gaudino G. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7072-7083Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), to bring about cellular apoptosis (12Iwama A. Yamaguchi N. Suda T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and to stimulate bone resorption (14Kurihara N. Iwama A. Tatsumi J. Ikeda K. Suda T. Blood. 1996; 87: 3704-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These functions are thought to be brought about by the binding of HGFL to its membrane-bound receptor, Ron (10Gaudino G. Follenzi A. Naldini L. Collesi C. Santoro M. Gallo K.A. Godowski P.J. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3524-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 15Wang M.-H. Ronsin C. Gesnel M.-C. Coupey L. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Breathnach R. Science. 1994; 266: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, the various functions of HGFL appear to be dependent on cell type and/or Ron expression levels, with no single cell performing all functions. As is the case for the ligands, the Ron gene product displays strong structural homology with the HGF receptor, Met (16Iwama A. Okano K. Sudo T. Matsuda Y. Suda T. Blood. 1994; 83: 3160-3169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Met receptor family encodes a variety of transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors including the HGFL receptor, Ron, and avian SEA (17Huff J.L. Jelinek M.A. Borgman C.A. Lansing T.J. Parsons T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6140-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Ron is a heterodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein expressed relatively late in development in the central and peripheral nervous system, in cells of developing bones and in epithelia along the digestive tract, skin, and lungs (18Quantin B. Schuhbaur B. Gesnel M.-C. Dolle P Breathnach R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Gaudino G. Avantaggiato V. Follenzi A. Acampora D. Simeone A. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2627-2637PubMed Google Scholar). Ron is synthesized as a single-chain precursor of 185 kDa. After synthesis, Ron is cleaved into a disulfide linked heterodimer consisting of a 35-kDa α chain and 150-kDa β chain. The α chain and amino-terminal region of the β chain are present at the cell surface. The cytoplasmic portion of Ron contains the kinase domain and phosphorylation sites required for eliciting activity through HGFL binding. Based on the pleiotropic effects of HGFL, the aims of the experiments presented in this paper were to elucidate the essential regions or domains in HGFL that may be required to elicit preferential biological activities. To accomplish this goal, a series of HGFL cDNAs lacking various domains or containing point mutations were constructed. Representative recombinant proteins were then produced and assayed for their ability to elicit cellular proliferation, macrophage activation, and cell scattering functions. Our findings represent an initial dissection of HGFL protein function and suggest the necessity of the light chain containing the serine protease-like domain for HGFL activity. Further, our results demonstrate the requirement of the various kringle domains for modulating protein activity. All mutants were generated using the pAlter1 mutagenesis kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with the appropriate mutagenic oligonucleotide listed in Table I and a wild-type human HGFL cDNA cloned into pAlter1. The wild-type HGFL cDNA is the cDNA presented in Han et al. (1Han S. Stuart L.A. Degen S.J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9768-9780Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), with the sequence from exon 1 included at its 5′ end. Mutants were identified by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis (ΔK1, ΔK2, ΔK3, ΔK4, ΔK1K2, and ΔPAP) or by sequence analysis alone (Glu, Xa, IIa, ΔL, and K1K2). All mutants were cloned into theEcoRI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in the proper orientation for expression after transient and stable transfections.Table IOligonucleotides used in creating wild-type and mutant forms of HGFLMutantNucleotidesHGFL sequenceStrandΔPAP146–165, 235–254ATGTGGCAGATGCTGAAGAGCAACTGCTGCCATGGACTCACodingΔK1308–327, 559–578AGAAAGACTACGTACGGACCCGGGAGGCCGCGTGTGTCTGCodingΔK2539–558, 805–824GCTGCGGCATCAAATCCTGCGGGTCCGAGGCACAGCCCCGCodingΔK3827–846, 1084–1103AAGAGGCCACAACTGTCAGCACAGACGACGTGCGGCCCCACodingΔK41088–1107, 1345–1364ACGACGTGCGGCCCCAGGACGCTGATGACCAGCCGCCATCCodingΔK1K2308–327, 805–824AGAAAGACTACGTACGGACCGGGTCCGAGGCACAGCCCCGCodingΔL1435–14641-aInserted stop codon (lowercase).CGTTCCAAGCTGCGCtagGTGGTTGGGGGCCATCodingK1K2805–8341-aInserted stop codon (lowercase).GGGTCCGAGGCACAGtagCCCCGCCAAGAGGCCCodingGlu1432–14641-bNucleotide substitutions to replace activation site with Glu for Arg-483, thrombin (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg), or factor Xa (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) recognition sequence (lowercase).CGGCGTTCCAAGCTGgagGTGGTTGGGGGCCATCodingXa1423–14611-bNucleotide substitutions to replace activation site with Glu for Arg-483, thrombin (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg), or factor Xa (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) recognition sequence (lowercase).CTGGATCAGCGGCGTatcgaaggtCGCGTGGTTGGGGGCCodingIIa1423–14611-bNucleotide substitutions to replace activation site with Glu for Arg-483, thrombin (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg), or factor Xa (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) recognition sequence (lowercase).CTGGATCAGCGGCGTctggttccgCGCGTGGTTGGGGGCCoding48G24–531-cDifference with Ref. 20.CCAGGGACCCCTAAGcATTGAGTCAGAAGCNon-coding1-a Inserted stop codon (lowercase).1-b Nucleotide substitutions to replace activation site with Glu for Arg-483, thrombin (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg), or factor Xa (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) recognition sequence (lowercase).1-c Difference with Ref. 20Yoshimura T.

Open table in a new tab One additional mutation was generated at nucleotide 48 in the signal sequence. Our original cDNA had an A at this position, whereas a G was present in the gene. This resulted in a tyrosine at amino acid 13 in the cDNA and a cysteine at this position in the gene. Because we were not sure what this difference would have on the expression of recombinant HGFL, we performed site-directed mutagenesis using the Chameleon kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotide 48G. The appropriate substitution was identified by DNA sequence analysis. CMT-93 (mouse rectum carcinoma), 293 (transformed human primary kidney), HT-29 (human colon adenocarcinoma), and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. For production of recombinant HGFL and HGFL mutant proteins, the corresponding cDNAs were transfected into tissue culture cells as described previously (21Waltz S.E. Gould F.K. Air E.L. McDowell S.A. Friezher-Degen S.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9024-9032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For transient protein expression, 293 cells were transfected and on the following day placed in serum-free medium for 5 additional days. For stable protein expression, CHO cells were transfected and placed in 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After selection, single colonies were isolated and cultured for 5 days in serum-free medium. The amount of recombinant HGFL protein from cell supernatants was measured by immunoblotting. For analysis of secreted recombinant protein, cell culture supernatants were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels under denaturing conditions. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred by electrophoresis to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol at 4 °C for 4 h at 250 mA. The membrane was probed with a polyclonal anti-HGFL rabbit antibody. The polyclonal antibody extensively used for HGFL detection was raised in rabbits against a fusion protein of β-galactosidase and a 960-base pair cDNA fragment coding for 321 amino acids of human HGFL (including part of the second kringle to the carboxyl terminus of the protein, which included part of the serine protease-like domain). This antibody recognizes mouse, rat, and human HGFL (7Bezerra J.A. Han S. Danton M.J.S. Degen S.J.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 666-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The membrane was then incubated with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody, followed by incubation with a preformed avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). A horseradish peroxidase luminescent visualization system (ECL, Amersham Life Science) was applied, and the membrane was exposed to x-ray film. A known amount of HGFL was used as a standard to determine the concentration of each recombinant protein by Western analysis. Recombinant protein was produced from all cDNA expression vectors with a range of concentrations from about 0.5 to 7 μg/ml in serum-free medium. Alternatively, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for protein quantification. Protein samples (native or reduced) were incubated in Nunc immunoplates overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed and incubated with primary antibody, washed again, and incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Peroxidase substrate was added, and the absorbance measured at 490 nm after color development. Samples were assayed against a concentration curve of wild-type human HGFL protein as a standard. To analyze if activation of HGFL was important before or during the functional assays, HGFL functions were tested with recombinant protein, which was cleaved by porcine or human kallikrein (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) at 50–100 nm. Kallikrein has been shown to cleave plasma HGFL into a functional heterodimer (22Wang M.-H. Yoshimura T. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3436-3440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No functional differences between kallikrein species were detected. Furthermore, the use of soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) in macrophage stimulation assays has been shown to enhance function (11Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All functional assays were also performed in combination with STI (Sigma). Identical results were obtained in all assays regardless of the use of kallikren, STI, or a combination of both before or during biological testing. CMT-93 cells were seeded in triplicate in 100 μl of complete medium at a concentration of 5 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture plate. Two days later, the medium was aspirated and 200 μl of medium containing 0.5% serum was added. After 48 h, recombinant HGFL protein (a concentration of 200–400 ng/ml was found to be optimal) was added. Two days after recombinant protein addition, 10 μl of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added for 16 h. The amount of BrdUrd incorporation was determined using an ELISA-based BrdUrd labeling and detection kit from Boehringer Mannheim according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the isolation of mouse resident peritoneal macrophages, the mouse was anesthetized and a small abdominal incision was made under sterile conditions. Ten milliliters of serum-free DMEM was introduced into the abdominal cavity, immediately withdrawn, and transferred to a 15-ml polypropylene tube. The cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in serum-free DMEM, and plated in six-well tissue culture dishes. Approximately 80% of the cells were macrophage, as determined microscopically. After 24 h, the cells were extensively washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and recombinant protein (or untransfected conditioned medium) was added in a volume of 1–2 ml. The number of macrophage were counted after 3 h, and the percent of macrophage with shape changes were determined. After counting, the macrophage were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, stained with hematoxylin, and photographed. For the isolation of lung macrophage, the mice were anesthetized and an abdominal incision was made. The mouse was exsanguinated from a cut in the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta. The anterior neck was dissected and the trachea cannulated with a 18-gauge catheter. The lungs were then perfused with 3 ml of serum-free DMEM, and the medium was immediately withdrawn and transferred to a polypropylene tube. This step was repeated to a total perfusion volume of 10 ml. The cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in serum-free DMEM, and plated in six-well tissue culture dishes. Approximately 80% of the cells were lung macrophage. Recombinant protein or control medium was applied as for peritoneal macrophages. A 293 cell line expressing the mouse Ron receptor was obtained by transfection with a full-length mouse Ron cDNA in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A clonal line (293/Ron) was isolated and used for further studies. For scattering assays, an approximately 70% confluent plate of 293/Ron cells was split 1:100 and placed in six-well tissue culture plates containing 5 ml of complete medium/well. The following day, the medium was aspirated and the cells were cultured with various concentrations of wild-type or deletion mutants of HGFL for 24–48 h. After culture, the cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and stained with hematoxylin. 293/Ron cells were grown to approximately 70% confluence in 60-mm tissue culture plates in complete medium. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and recombinant protein (or appropriate controls) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Detachment from the tissue culture plates was accomplished in 2 ml of Versene in PBS. The cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS, followed by resuspension in a solution of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and a 1:1 mixture of antibodies directed against HGFL and an anti-rabbit-fluorescein conjugate. After a 30-min incubation period on ice, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS followed by fixation in PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then analyzed by measuring fluorescence intensity on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Results are expressed as the mean channel fluorescence of 10,000 cells using logarithmic amplification. The Ron protein was purified by an anti-Ron affinity column as described previously (42Wang M.-H. Montero-Julian F.A. Dauny I. Leonard E.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2167-2175PubMed Google Scholar). To study the interaction of Ron with multiple HGFL recombinant proteins, the Ron receptor was purified, placed in a 96-well ELISA plate at 50 ng/well, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected from cells transfected with different HGFL variant cDNAs, and equal amounts of HGFL recombinant proteins were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. To measure the amount of captured recombinant protein, an antibody against HGFL was added (42Wang M.-H. Montero-Julian F.A. Dauny I. Leonard E.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2167-2175PubMed Google Scholar). For detection analyses, an anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim) was applied to the wells. The reaction was developed with substrate, and theA 405 was measured in an ELISA plate reader. Each sample was tested in duplicate. The single-chain form of HGFL (WT HGFL up, Fig. 9) was utilized initially for these experiments. However, it became apparent that processed preparations were needed for full activity. Thus, the wild-type (WT) HGFL in Fig. 9 contains significant amounts of proteolytically cleaved protein. In an effort to identify important structural domains involved in the function of HGFL, a panel of mutated cDNAs of HGFL were constructed. Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the structural domains contained within the wild-type human HGFL protein (wt). The schematics shown below wild-type HGFL consist of predicted translation products generated from transfection of HGFL mutant cDNAs. Eight deletion mutants and four site-directed mutants of HGFL were created by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The deletion mutants were created by deletion of the cDNA sequence corresponding to the HGFL domain of interest (ΔPAP, ΔK1, ΔK2, ΔK3, ΔK4, ΔK1K2, or sequence following kringle 2 as in K1K2). Deletion of the light chain of HGFL (ΔL) was accomplished by creating a stop codon (TAG) after amino acid 483, immediately preceding the activation site. To study the effect of proteolytic cleavage as it relates to HGFL function, a mutation that disrupts the putative cleavage site was also created with the substitution of Glu for Arg-483 at the activation site (Glu). Furthermore, two mutations were created in which an engineered processing site for factor Xa (Xa) or thrombin (IIa) was created at the putative activation site of HGFL. The Xa processing site changed amino acids Ser-480, Lys-481, Gly-482 to Ile-480, Glu-481, and Gly-482, whereas the IIa site was created by changing these amino acids to Leu, Val, and Pro, respectively. Not shown in Fig. 1 is a mouse HGFL clone containing the full-length cDNA for expression of recombinant mouse HGFL (mwtHGFL; Ref.3Degen S.J.F. Stuart L.A. Han S. Jamison C.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9781-9791Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). All of the cDNAs for the corresponding proteins in Fig. 1 were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 and transfected either stably into CHO cells or transiently into 293 cells. Serum-free culture medium from the transfected cells was used as a source of recombinant HGFL. Fig. 2 shows representative samples of culture medium from wild-type and mutant HGFLs separated under reducing conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody against HGFL. A majority of the protein products appeared to consist of the single-chain form of HGFL. In culture medium from untransfected cells, as well as both stable and transient transfections with wild-type and mutant forms of HGFL, variable nonspecific background was also seen. The band migrating at approximately 65 kDa (Fig. 2,lanes WT, Glu, and IIa) is thought to represent bovine serum albumin for several reasons. This band diminishes with the addition of bovine serum albumin during antibody incubation (data not shown), and the intensity also decreases when the cells are extensively washed with PBS (four to six times) before incubation with serum-free medium (Fig. 2, lanes ΔK1,ΔK3, and K1K2). Furthermore, this band appears to originate from serum since addition of serum to untransfected and recombinant supernatants produces a band of similar mobility. Nevertheless, recombinant protein preparations with or without this band have identical functional activities. Further, recombinant proteins purified by heparin agarose isolation performed identically in biological assays to unpurified recombinant supernatants from transfected cells (data not shown). The concentration of each mutant was determined, and equal amounts of protein were applied to the various assays. Because of the fact that HGFL has the ability to induce a variety of effects, functional analyses were performed on cells that displayed the experimental phenotype. Scattering experiments using HGF have been primarily performed on MDCK cells because of the fact that these cells form tight monolayers and express the endogenous HGF receptor. MDCK cells were not responsive to recombinant HGFL, suggesting that the Ron receptor may not be expressed by these cells (data not shown). 293 cells were then chosen for scattering experiments because these cells are easily transfected and because they displayed the same phenotypic changes seen with HGF and MDCK cells after transfection with the mouse Ron receptor cDNA. A clonal line of 293 cells containing approximately wild-type levels of exogenous Ron, as judged by Western analysis with endogenously expressing Ron cell lines, was then chosen for further study. Equal amounts of the various recombinant HGFL proteins were tested for scattering activity on this 293/Ron cell line. Fig.3 A shows the morphogenic effects of various recombinant HGFL proteins on these cells. In the absence of HGFL protein, the 293/Ron cells show a coherent morphology. In contrast, with the addition of wild-type HGFL, the cells display a scattered phenotype. A striking scattering effect was observed in an optimal range of approximately 200–400 ng/ml of wild-type HGFL. The physiologic concentration of HGFL found in human plasma is approximately 400 ng/ml (7Bezerra J.A. Han S. Danton M.J.S. Degen S.J.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 666-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The histogram in Fig. 3 B shows a summation of the ability of each of the recombinant HGFL mutants to cause cell scattering. As is demonstrated, deletions of kringles 2 and 3 along with deletion of the light chain of HGFL results in no effect on cell scattering. HGFL has been shown to cause dramatic morphological effects on mouse peritoneal macrophage (4Leonard E. Skeel A. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 114: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5Leonard E. Skeel A. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 102: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Among these effects are the ability to activate macrophage contractile proteins for the ingestion of complement coated erythrocytes and the ability to assume elongated shapes with increased phagocytic vesicles (4Leonard E. Skeel A. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 114: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5Leonard E. Skeel A. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 102: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To identify domains within HGFL that are responsible for stimulating the morphogenic phenotype of these cells, stimulation of both lung and peritoneal macrophage were examined. Recombinant supernatant from cells transfected with the wild-type and mutated forms of HGFL was applied to macrophage cultures. After 3 h, the number of stimulated macrophage were counted and photographed. Fig.4 shows representative results for various recombinant mutants tested. Wild-type and various mutated versions of HGFL (such as Glu and Xa) showed an increased ability to stimulate peritoneal macrophage, as indicated by elongated shape changes.

The first part of the presequence targets the protein to mitochondria and mediates translocation into the mitochondrial matrix compartment; the second part contains the sorting signal that is required for delivery of the protein to the intermembrane space. The localization of the structures that recognize the sorting signal is unclear. Here we show that upon import in vivo, the sorting signal of cytochromeb 2 causes an early divergence from the general matrix import pathway and thereby prevents translocation of a folded C-terminal domain into mitochondria. By co-immunoprecipitations we find that translocation intermediates of cytochromeb 2 are associated with Tim23, a component of the inner membrane protein import machinery. Cytochromeb 2 constructs with an alteration in the sorting signal are mistargeted to the matrix of wild-type mitochondria. In mitochondria containing a mutant form of Tim23, however, the translocation of the altered sorting signal across the inner membrane is inhibited, and cytochrome b 2 is correctly sorted to the intermembrane space.

Nearly all mitochondrial proteins are synthesized by cytosolic ribosomes and posttranslationally imported into the organelle (1Pon L. Schatz G. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W.

Translocation across the outer membrane requires transport through a general import pore that is formed by a complex of Tom proteins. Translocation across the inner membrane involves a common step for all preproteins carrying a presequence and is mediated by a complex of the translocase proteins Tim17 1The abbreviations used are: Timx, component of the protein translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane of molecular weight x; Tomx, component of the protein translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane of molecular weight x; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; Fe/S protein, Rieske iron/sulfur protein of respiratory chain complex III; HB, heme-binding domain of cytochromeb 2; MOPS, 4-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; mtHsp70, mitochondrial heat shock protein of 70 kDa; pb2-DHFR, precursor of cytochrome b2-DHFR fusion protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SP, spheroplasts; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: Timx, component of the protein translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane of molecular weight x; Tomx, component of the protein translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane of molecular weight x; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; Fe/S protein, Rieske iron/sulfur protein of respiratory chain complex III; HB, heme-binding domain of cytochromeb 2; MOPS, 4-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; mtHsp70, mitochondrial heat shock protein of 70 kDa; pb2-DHFR, precursor of cytochrome b2-DHFR fusion protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SP, spheroplasts; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.and Tim23 (Refs. 4Pfanner N.

The initial entry of preproteins into the inner membrane requires the membrane potential (Δψ). The matrix heat shock protein 70 (mtHsp70) then binds to segments of the preproteins emerging on the matrix side and drives their further translocation in an ATP-dependent reaction. In addition, mtHsp70 promotes the unfolding of preprotein domains during entry into the mitochondrial membranes. This is thought to occur by generation of an inward-directed force by preprotein-bound mtHsp70 (pulling). mtHsp70 transiently binds to the inner membrane, to the peripheral membrane protein Tim44 (8Horst M.

Rassow J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2205-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); therefore, conformational changes of mtHsp70 are directional and can exert a force on the preprotein in transit. Cytochrome b 2 of yeast mitochondria has for many years served as a paradigm in elucidating the more complex import pathways of proteins that have a final location in the intermembrane space. In this compartment, mature cytochrome b 2(l(+)-lactate cytochrome c oxidoreductase) is a soluble tetrameric protein (12Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Reid G.A. Yonetani T. Schatz G. J. Biol.

The preprotein contains a bipartite presequence. The first part of the presequence (residues 1–31) mediates translocation across both mitochondrial membranes and is cleaved in the matrix. The second part (residues 32–80) contains the information that is required for sorting of the protein to the intermembrane space. The inner membrane peptidase I, which carries the catalytic site on the intermembrane space side (15Schneider A. Behrens M. Scherer P. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), removes the second part of the presequence, yielding the mature protein. The sorting signal of cytochrome b 2 resembles the targeting signals of secretory bacterial proteins, suggesting a conservation of targeting mechanisms in mitochondria in line with the endo-symbiont theory of organelle evolution (16Hartl F.U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The sequencing project of the yeast genome, however, has recently demonstrated that a possible conservation of the prokaryotic targeting system does not include a conservation of the Sec machinery of the prokaryotic translocase; homologs of sec genes have not been found in the yeast genome (17Glick B.S. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2651-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This does not exclude a conservation of mechanistic principles. In a series of studies it has been shown that the sorting signal of cytochrome b 2 seems to be imported into the matrix in tandem with the first part of the presequence (18Hartl F.U. Ostermann J. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 19Koll H. Guiard B. Rassow J. Ostermann J. Horwich A.L. Neupert W. Hartl F.U.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1349-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that the sorting signal is subsequently recognized by a separate system besides the import machinery and re-exported to the intermembrane space. Other data have suggested that the sorting signal serves as a stop signal in the import machinery and does not proceed into the matrix (24van Loon A.P.G.M. Brändli A.W. Schatz G. Cell. 1986; 44: 801-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Müller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G.

Müller S. Schatz G. Glick B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17279-17288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this concept, the sorting signal leaves the import machinery in the inner membrane laterally, without involvement of a separate reexport system. In a previous study we used different constructs of cytochromeb 2 as a molecular ruler to localize the functional sorting signal within the mitochondrion (29Gärtner F. Bömer U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6043-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). By studyingin vitro import into isolated mitochondria, we found that the sorting signal functions already during insertion into the inner membrane. mtHsp70 could exert an unfolding (pulling) activity only on folded domains that were located close to the cytochromeb 2 presequence. A folded domain located at the C terminus of a cytochrome b 2 fusion protein was not unfolded and therefore not translocated across the outer membrane, suggesting that the sorting signal directed an early divergence of the preprotein from the mtHsp70-driven matrix import pathway. We now asked whether these in vitro findings were of relevance for protein sorting in vivo. We indeed observed that the sorting signal of cytochrome b 2 strongly restricts the unfolding activity of the mitochondrial import machinery in intact cells. It prevents import of a folded C-terminal domain and finally leads to retrograde translocation and accumulation of the mature sized protein in the cytosol. To further localize the submitochondrial site of sorting of cytochrome b 2, we characterized a mutant form of the channel protein Tim23 and found that thetim23-2 mutation suppressed the mis-sorting of a cytochromeb 2 construct containing an altered sorting signal. Our results indicate a branching site of import pathways in the inner membrane Tim machinery, separating the import pathway of cytochrome b 2 from the general transport channel of matrix targeted proteins. We suggest that the sorting signal of cytochrome b 2 is recognized in close vicinity to Tim23. For expression in yeast, the DNA constructs were cut from pGEM4 plasmids (29Gärtner F. Bömer U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6043-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Rassow J. Hartl F.-U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and transferred to the yeast expression plasmid pYE DP 1/8–10 (31Cullin C. Pompon D. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 65: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The pGEM4 plasmids were cut byHindIII at the 3′-end of the inserts and filled by Klenow fragment, and a BglII linker was inserted. The inserts were subsequently released from the plasmids by cutting withEcoRI and BglII and inserted between theEcoRI and BamHI sites of the vector pYE DP 1/8–10. The plasmids were propagated in the yeast strain 334 (32Hovland P. Flick J. Johnston M. Sclafani R.A. Gene (Amst .). 1989; 83: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This strain has no glucose repression of GAL expression and cannot utilize galactose. The cytochrome b 2* constructs were made by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Two subsequent PCRs were performed on pb2-(1–84)-DHFR in pGEM4 (30Rassow J. Hartl F.-U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the first reaction, a 5′-primer corresponding to the SP6 promotor was combined with the 3′-mutagenesis primer. The resulting PCR product was used as 5′-primer in a second PCR with a 3′-primer corresponding to the T7 promotor. An EcoRI-MscI fragment of the PCR product was inserted between the EcoRI and MscI sites of the corresponding cytochrome b 2constructs to introduce the mutations. The presequences of the resulting constructs were sequenced. All DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard procedures (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar, 34$$Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in selective synthetic complete medium containing 3% glycerol to anA 600 of 0.8–1.2. Galactose was added to a final concentration of 2% to induce the expression of the cytochromeb 2 fusion proteins. After 4 h of induction, ∼20 mg of cells were collected by centrifugation and converted to spheroplasts by zymolyase treatment as described previously (12Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The suspension was divided into 5 aliquots, and the spheroplasts were reisolated by centrifugation (1 min, 16,000 × g). Two aliquots were resuspended in 350 μl of cold permeabilization buffer (0.1 m potassium acetate, 0.2 m sorbitol, 2 mm MgCl2, supplemented with 0.02 volumes of 1m HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2) to open the plasma membrane (“perm. SP”) (35Ruohola H. Kabcenell A.K. Ferro-Novick S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The permeabilized spheroplasts were reisolated by centrifugation (10 min, 16,000 × g). Pellet and supernatant were separated and the proteins released to the supernatant were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 0.05% sodium deoxycholate. One aliquot of the suspensions of spheroplasts was resuspended in 350 μl of EM buffer (1 mmEDTA, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) to open the plasma membrane and the outer mitochondrial membrane (“swelling”). The spheroplasts of an additional aliquot were resuspended in EM buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 to lyse all organelles. The latter two samples and one of the samples with permeabilized spheroplasts were treated with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) to digest the cytochromeb 2 fusion proteins not protected by membranes. The fifth aliquot of spheroplasts was taken as a control and analyzed directly (“total SP”). Samples were resuspended in 100 μl of sample buffer, and portions of 40 μl were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies directed against DHFR. Antibodies directed against the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tom20 were used to control the fractionation procedure. To compare the growth rate of different yeast strains (as shown in Fig.2), the cells were first grown in liquid selective minimal medium at 28 °C containing 2% glucose. The cultures were diluted with Ringer's solution and spotted on selective minimal medium plates containing 2% glucose or 2% glucose and 2% galactose. After 5 days at 28 °C, cells were scraped from the plates and again diluted with Ringer's solution and spotted onto plates. Plates were incubated for 5 days at 28 °C. Yeast cells were grown in YPG medium (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 3% glycerol), and mitochondria were prepared according to published procedures (12Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J.

Radiolabeled preproteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine afterin vitro transcription by SP6 RNA polymerase (Amersham Corp., Stratagene) or by coupled transcription/translation with T7 polymerase (Stratagene). Isolated yeast mitochondria (15–25 μg) were incubated with reticulocyte lysate containing the radiolabeled preprotein (5–10% (v/v)) in import buffer (3% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 250 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium malate, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 1 μm valinomycin and cooling on ice. Samples with a dissipated membrane potential received valinomycin prior to incubation with preprotein. For generation of mitoplasts, import reactions were diluted with 9 volumes of EM buffer and left on ice for 30 min. Control mitochondria were diluted with isotonic SEM buffer (EM buffer supplemented with 250 mm sucrose). Proteinase K treatment, reisolation of mitochondria, and separation by SDS-PAGE or Tricine-SDS-PAGE have been described previously (39Bömer U. Rassow J. Zufall N. Pfanner N. Meijer M. Maarse A.C. J.

Autoradiographs were obtained and quantified using a storage PhosphorImaging system (Molecular Dynamics). Specific antibodies were pre-bound to protein A-Sepharose (10 μl wet volume, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h in 480 μl of lysis buffer (1% digitonin (Merck, 1 × recrystallized from ethanol), 10% glycerol (w/v), 50 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). Import reactions were performed for 20 min with 25 μg of mitochondrial protein per lane and 20% (v/v) reticulocyte lysate. After reisolation and washing with SEM buffer, mitochondria were resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.25 μg/ml chymostatin, 1.25 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and shaken end-over-end for 10 min at 8 °C. Unsolubilized material was removed by ultracentrifugation (30 min at 100,000 × g). The supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 8 °C by end-over-end shaking with antibodies prebound to protein A-Sepharose. After three washing cycles with lysis buffer, the protein A-Sepharose pellets were heated in sample buffer and applied to SDS-PAGE. Gärtner et al. (29Gärtner F. Bömer U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6043-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) used three building blocks to monitor the sorting and unfolding pathway of cytochrome b 2 in isolated mitochondria (Fig.1 A) as follows: the bipartite presequence; the ∼100-residue non-covalent heme binding domain (HB) of cytochrome b 2 that forms a tightly folded domain and strictly depends on the function of mtHsp70 for unfolding and translocation across the mitochondrial membranes (26Glick B.S. Wachter C. Reid G.A. Schatz G. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1901-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 41Voos W. Gambill D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); and the cytosolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) as passenger protein, the unfolding of DHFR requires only a low energy input and thus does not depend on functional mtHsp70 (29Gärtner F. Bömer U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6043-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 41Voos W. Gambill D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the in vitroexperiments, a heme binding domain located at the C terminus (pb2-DHFR-HB) was not imported but got stuck in the mitochondrial import sites. When the intramitochondrial sorting signal was inactivated by deletion of a 19-residue segment, the resulting preprotein pb2Δ-DHFR-HB was completely imported (29Gärtner F. Bömer U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6043-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We now expressed the hybrid proteins (Fig. 1 A) from a galactose-inducible vector in intact S. cerevisiae cells. To avoid indirect effects of the induction by galactose, a yeast strain with gal1 mutation was employed that cannot utilize galactose as carbon source and lacks a glucose repression ofGAL expression (32Hovland P. Flick J. Johnston M. Sclafani R.A. Gene (Amst .). 1989; 83: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). After a 4-h induction, cells were isolated and converted to permeabilized spheroplasts (Fig.1 B). We first analyzed two hybrid proteins with a complete presequence and DHFR at the C terminus; the heme binding domain was either directly adjacent to the presequence (pb2-HB-DHFR) or not included (pb2-DHFR). Both proteins were found in the organellar pellet of permeabilized spheroplasts (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 8) and protected against proteinase K (Fig.1 B, lanes 6 and 12) unless the membranes were disrupted with detergent (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and11). In a hypotonic buffer (to swell mitochondria and open the intermembrane space), both proteins became accessible to added protease (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 10). pb2-HB-DHFR was efficiently processed to the mature sized form (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), whereas pb2-DHFR was observed in both the intermediate sized form and the mature sized form (Fig. 1 B, lane 7). A slower processing of pb2-DHFR has also observed in in vitro import experiments (29Gärtner F. Bömer U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6043-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and may be attributed to a lack of most sequences of mature cytochrome b 2. No precursor sized forms of the hybrid proteins were observed. These results indicate an efficient import of the proteins into mitochondria and a correct sorting to the intermembrane space in vivo. We then studied the localization of the construct b2-DHFR-HB (Fig. 1 B, lanes 13–18). This protein was efficiently processed to the mature sized form; only minute amounts of precursor or intermediate sized forms were observed (Fig. 1 B, lane 13). However, the processed protein was mainly found in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1 B, lane 15) and not protected against proteinase K in permeabilized spheroplasts (Fig. 1 B, lane 18). A placement of the heme binding domain at the C terminus of a hybrid protein thus reveals a striking effect on its cellular sorting and prevents a complete import into mitochondria. We will address below (see Fig. 3) the mechanism how a processed protein can be found in the cytosolic fraction. When the cytochrome b 2 sorting signal was inactivated, the resulting hybrid protein b2Δ-DHFR-HB was found in the organellar fraction (Fig. 1 B, lanes 20 and24). It remained protease-protected also in swollen mitochondria (Fig. 1 B, lane 22), demonstrating it was transported across the inner membrane. These results indicate that pb2-HB-DHFR, pb2-DHFR, and pb2Δ-DHFR-HB were correctly sorted into mitochondria in vivo comparable to the situationin vitro. Mis-sorting of the hybrid protein depends on both the presence of the heme binding domain at the C terminus and an intact sorting signal (pb2-DHFR-HB). To determine the effect on the viability of yeast cells, we expressed the hybrid proteins permanently by growing yeast on galactose-containing medium (Fig.2, right panel). While pb2Δ-DHFR-HB and pb2-DHFR did not affect cellular growth, cells expressing pb2-DHFR-HB grew poorly. The mis-sorting of pb2-DHFR-HB is thus accompanied by an inhibitory effect on cellular viability. The results obtained with b2-DHFR-HB in vivo (this study) and in vitro (29Gärtner F. Bömer U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6043-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are on the one hand comparable; under both conditions, the hybrid protein was not completely imported into mitochondria, indicating that the presence of an intact sorting signal prevents import of the heme binding domain located at the C terminus. On the other hand, the processing and the final location of b2-DHFR-HB were different between the in vivoand the in vitro situation; in vivo the hybrid protein was processed to the mature form and found in the cytosolic fraction; in vitro processing was mainly to the intermediate sized form that got stuck in mitochondrial import sites (29Gärtner F. Bömer U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6043-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This difference can be attributed to the slow kinetics of the second processing step. Since the in vitro experiments have to be performed within a time range of ∼1 h due to the limited stability of the isolated mitochondria, the time range used for the in vivo experiments (4 h) is not possible. For further characterization of the b2-DHFR-HB transport intermediates, we again used isolated mitochondria and imported the preprotein from reticulocyte lysate. To complete the processing of b2-DHFR-HB in vitro, a short term import incubation was followed by a reisolation of the mitochondria and a second incubation (chase). pb2-DHFR-HB and, as control, pb2-DHFR were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine and incubated with isolated energized yeast mitochondria for 10 min. The mitochondria were reisolated and incubated again (chases, without further addition of preproteins) (Fig. 3, A andB). b2-DHFR was processed to the intermediate and mature sized forms (Fig. 3 A, upper panel, columns 5 and7) and transported to a protease-protected location (Fig.3 A, upper panel, columns 6 and 8). No b2-DHFR was found in the supernatant after the chase reaction (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). b2-DHFR-HB was also processed to the intermediate and mature sized forms (Fig.3 A, columns 1 and 3), but none of the forms was protected against proteinase K added to the mitochondria after the chase reaction (Fig. 3 A, columns 2 and 4). Moreover, a major portion of the mature protein was found in the supernatant after the chase (Fig. 3 A, lower panel, column 3). Fig. 3 B shows the time-dependent formation of mature b2-DHFR-HB during the chase reaction and the release into the supernatant. When the mitochondrial membrane potential was dissipated before the import reaction, no processing to intermediate or mature sized forms was observed (not shown), demonstrating that the processing occurred in mitochondria. We conclude that b2-DHFR-HB was transported partially into mitochondria such that the presequence could be cleaved by the matrix processing peptidase and the inner membrane peptidase I (the folded heme binding domain remained outside mitochondria as shown previously (29Gärtner F. Bömer U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6043-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). The intermediate sized form remained stuck in the mitochondrial membranes (accessible to externally added protease), whereas the mature sized form was mainly released to the supernatant. If the cytochromeb 2 sorting sequence is arrested in the mitochondrial inner membrane, it should be possible to demonstrate interactions of translocation intermediates with distinct components of the inner membrane protein import machinery. By co-immunoprecipitation, we first tested for association of preproteins with Tim23. The following hybrid proteins were used: b2-DHFR with a fully functional cytochrome b 2 presequence; b2*-DHFR with a partial inactivation of the sorting signal by replacing two positively charged residues (lysine 48 and arginine 49) by uncharged residues (Fig.4 A), the resulting hybrid protein is mistargeted into the matrix space (see below, Fig.6 B) (20Schwarz E.

https://openalex.org/W2159934672,"Recent genetic studies indicate that several molecular variants discovered in angiotensinogen (AG), the precursor of vasoactive octapeptide angiotensin II, could potentially be responsible for inherited predisposition to human blood pressure variation. We have previously shown that a ubiquitously expressed nuclear factor, AGCF1, bound to AGCE1 (AGcore promoterelement 1 including the core nucleotides,CTCGTG, CTC-type) located between the TATA box and transcription initiation site (positions −25 to −1) is an authentic regulator of human AG transcription. In the present study, we showed that AGCF1 has biologically and immunologically similar properties to those of a helix-loop-helix nuclear factor USF1 and examined the effects of two other naturally occurring molecular variants (ATCGTG, ATC-type and ATTGTG, ATT-type) found in the AGCE1 position on the human AG transcriptional activity. Competitive gel-shift and transfection experiments demonstrated that the transcriptional activity for the CTC- and ATC-type promoters was 2.5 times higher than that for the ATT-type through the alteration of AGCF1-binding affinity. These results suggest the possible involvement of USF1 as a component in AGCF1 formation and the potential importance of AGCE1 variation in blood pressure regulation through human AG expression.

The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. The reaction between renin and angiotensinogen (AG) 1The abbreviations used are: AG, angiotensinogen; hAG, human AG; AGCF1, human AG core promoter binding factor 1; AGCE1, human AG core promoter element 1; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; HLH, helix-loop-helix. is the initial and rate-limiting step of this enzymatic cascade that generates the decapeptide angiotensin I, which is further processed to the functional octapeptide angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (1Reid I.A.

Because plasma AG concentration is close to the K m of the renin reaction, variation of plasma AG concentration can influence angiotensin II generation (4Gould A.B. Green B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1971; 5: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Several observations indicate a direct relationship between plasma AG levels and blood pressure. First, plasma AG concentrations highly correlate with blood pressures in some patients (5Walker W.G. Whelton P.K. Saito H. Russell P.P. Hermann J. Hypertension. 1979; 1: 473-482Crossref Google Scholar), and associations between AG concentrations and hypertension have been demonstrated in families (6Fasola A.F. Martz B.L. Helmer O.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1968; 25: 410-415Crossref Google Scholar). Second, the overexpression of AG leads to elevated blood pressure in transgenic animals (7Kimura S. Mullins J.J. Bunnemann B. Metzger R. Hilgenfeldt U. Zimmermann F. Jacob H. Fuxe K. Ganten D. Kaling M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recently, Jeunemaitre et al. (8Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Lifton R.P. Williams C.S. Charru A. Hunt S.C. Hopkins N.P. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.-M. Corvol P. Cell. 1992; 71: 169-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar) showed that a common AG gene variant, M235T, was significantly linked to essential hypertension and was also associated with elevated plasma AG concentration. Whether M235T directly accounts for a physiological effect or acts as a marker for a causative mutation is as yet unresolved, they proposed that some other variants of the AG gene lead to a chronic increase in AG levels and thereby eventually to increased blood pressure. AG is mainly synthesized in the liver and is secreted into the plasma through the constitutive pathway (9Lynch K.R. Peach M.J. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible to suppose that the transcriptional regulation of the AG gene affects its plasma concentration. Kim et al. (10Kim H.-S. Krege J.H. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R. Hodgin J.B. Best C.F. Jennette J.C. Coffman T.M. Maeda N. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2735-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) have generated mice carrying two, three, or four functional copies of the murine wild-type AG gene at its normal chromosomal location and reported that plasma AG levels increased progressively with an increase in blood pressure. A recent study showed that the inhibition of AG transcription resulted in a reduction in plasma AG levels associated with a decrease in blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats, by using synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides as “decoy” cis-elements to block the binding of nuclear factors to the targeted promoter regions (11Morishita R. Higaki J. Tomita N. Aoki M. Moriguchi A. Tamura K. Murakami K. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 502-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest an etiological importance of the transcriptional regulation of the AG gene. We previously identified several regulatory elements of the human AG gene transcription including the upstream and downstream activating elements (12Shimada S. Yanai K. Takahashi S. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 13Nibu Y. Takahashi S. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol.

Commun. 1994; 205: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and recently demonstrated that a ubiquitously expressed nuclear factor, AGCF1, bound to AGCE1 (AGcore promoter element 1) including the core nucleotides (CTCGTG), an E box-like motif located between the TATA box and transcription initiation site, is an authentic regulator that mediates the responsiveness to multiple AG regulatory elements (15Yanai K. Nibu Y.K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15981-15986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent genetic study found the three types of molecular variants, CTCGTG, ATCGTG, and ATTGTG, in the AGCE1 position of the human AG promoters (8Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Lifton R.P. Williams C.S. Charru A. Hunt S.C. Hopkins N.P. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.-M. Corvol P. Cell. 1992; 71: 169-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether these variations affect the AGCF1-binding affinity and the human AG transcriptional activity. Here, we suggested the possible involvement of USF1, an E box-binding helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factor (16Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) as a component in AGCF1 formation and discussed the potentially important relationship between the naturally occurring AGCE1 variations and their transcriptional activity. The reconstituted human AG gene, 13B2(3′)(+) and 13Am4B2(3′)(+) were constructed as described previously (15Yanai K. Nibu Y.K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15981-15986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 13cat were used as templates to construct mutations in AGCE1 by oligonucleotides-directed mutagenesis (15Yanai K. Nibu Y.K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15981-15986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Kuipers O.P. Boot H.J. de Vos W.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4458Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Once the site-directed mutations were obtained and confirmed by sequencing, the altered 1266-base pair (position −1222 to +44) fragments were used for constructions of 13(ATC)B2(3′)(+) and 13(ATT)B2(3′)(+). Human USF1 cDNA fragment were obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as follows. Single-stranded cDNA generated from human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) total RNA using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) was subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers synthesized based on the human USF sequence (18Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar): 5′-TCGGGAATTCCCCCTCACAGAGAGATGAAGGGG-3′ (primer 1; corresponding to nucleotide 97–129) for the full-length fragment, or 5′-GGTCGAATTCCCGCCATGATGTCACCACAAGAAGTACTG-3′ (primer 2; corresponding to nucleotide 607–630) for the truncated fragment, and 5′-GATCCCTCGAGTTAGTTGCTGTCATTCTTGATGACG-3′ (primer 3; comple- mentary to nucleotides 1029–1053). DNA amplification using a GeneAmp AmpliTaq PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) was performed in a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler with 25 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (63 °C, 1 min), and extension (72 °C, 1 min). The obtained fragment was cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and confirmed by sequencing. HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and nonessential amino acids. The cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and transfected 24 h later by calcium phosphate co-precipitation with reporter plasmids (3 μg) and a β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pCMV-βgal (1 μg) to normalize transfection efficiency. In the co-transfection assay, 2 μg of reporter plasmids were transfected with 1, 2, or 4 μg of modulator plasmids and 1 μg of pCMV-βgal. Total amounts of DNA were adjusted 7 μg by pcDNA3. After 48 h of culture, β-galactosidase activities were measured (19Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and cell extracts containing equivalent amounts of β-galactosidase activity were used for CAT assay (20Fukamizu A. Takahashi S. Seo M.S. Tada M. Tanimoto K. Uehara S. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7576-7582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated form was measured with a Bio-imaging analyzer (Model BAS2000; Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells were prepared using the protocol of Dignamet al. (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA probe was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)] (Boehringer Mannheim) and end-labeled oligonucleotide (0.5 ng, approximately 15,000 cpm) at 20 °C for 15 min in the presence or absence of the unlabeled oligonucleotides. The binding reaction was carried out in a solution containing 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. In the supershift experiments, 2 μl of USF1-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixtures were directly loaded onto 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 4% glycerol made in 1 × TBE (90 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mmEDTA). After electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 2.5 h at 4 °C, the gels were dried and autoradiographed with an intensifying screen. We previously showed that AGCF1 contained 31-, 33-, and 43-kDa proteins as major components by UV cross-linking (15Yanai K. Nibu Y.K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15981-15986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the course of characterizing AGCF1, we noticed that its binding activity was heat-stable and affected by MgCl2 (data not shown). These observations allowed us to speculate that the 43-kDa proteins identified would be USF1, which is classified as the members of basic HLH/leucine zipper family of transcription factors (16Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), although the nucleotide residue at position −18 in AGCE1 of the human AG core promoter was substituted to the thymidine (CTCGTG) from the adenine (CACGTG) in a consensus E box for USF. To examine whether USF1, a heat-stable MgCl2-sensitive 43-kDa transcription factor, is a component of AGCF1, we performed EMSA using the nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2 cells (Fig.1). The DNA-protein complex formed by AGCF1 binding to AGCE1 was inhibited by molar excess of nonlabeled USF1 binding element of the adenovirus major late promoter (18Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) as well as AGCE1, although retinoic acid response element 1 of the cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II promoter (CRABPII-1) (22Durand B. Saunders M. Leroy P. Leid M. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 71: 73-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and estrogen response element of vitellogenin promoter (vit-ERE) (23Hyder S.M. Stancel G.M. Nawaz Z. McDonnell D.P. Loose-Mitchell D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18047-18054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which had partially related sequences to AGCE1 (Fig. 1 A), did not compete for this binding at all (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–6). Similar results were obtained by using the adenovirus major late promoter as the probes (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7–12). Furthermore, the addition of USF1-specific antibody to EMSA reactions generated a supershifted complex (Fig. 1 B, compare lane 13 with lane 14), indicating that AGCF1 complex contains USF1. The ability of USF1 to function as a transcriptional modulator of the human AG gene was analyzed by using a dominant negative form of USF1 protein (dnUSF) that lacked the NH2-terminal activation domain but possessed its DNA binding domain (Fig.2 A) (24Kirschbaum B.J. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5094-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The bacterially expressed GST-dnUSF fusion protein had the same binding specificity as compared with that of AGCF1 (data not shown). The expression of dnUSF dramatically reduced the transcriptional activity of the reconstituted human AG gene (13B2(3′)(+)) but had little effect on that of the Am4 mutant (13Am4B2(3′)(+)) that completely disrupted AGCF1 bindingin vitro (15Yanai K. Nibu Y.K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15981-15986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 B). To further confirm the participation of USF1 in human AG transcription, an activator form of USF1 was co-transfected with the human AG reporters (Fig. 3 A). In this assay, we used the minimal hAG core promoter (including only TATA box and AGCE1) as a reporter because of the saturated CAT activity in the reconstituted construct and to avoid the effects of hAG regulatory elements other than AGCE1. The expression of full-length USF1 activated the human AG minimal promoter (DM12cat), but had little effect on that of the Am4 mutant (DM12Am4cat) in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that USF1 could regulate the human AG gene transcription in the AGCE1-dependent manner.Figure 3Activation by an activator form USF1 of the human AG core promoter.

Open boxes marked TATA boxand white vertical lines represent TATA box and AGCE1 mutation (Am4), respectively. B, transfection experiments and CAT assays were performed as described in Fig.2 B. The effect of USF1 on DM12cat and DM12Am4cat is indicated by □ and ○, respectively. The CAT activity of DM12cat is designated as 1, and each value of CAT activity represents the mean ± S.E. for at least four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, a previous genetic study identified the three types of molecular variants, CTCGTG, ATCGTC, andATTGTG (8Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Lifton R.P. Williams C.S. Charru A. Hunt S.C. Hopkins N.P. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.-M. Corvol P. Cell. 1992; 71: 169-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar), localized to AGCE1 position of the human hAG promoters. In contrast, these E box-like motifs in AGCE1 were not conserved in the rodent angiotensinogen promoters (Fig.4 A) (25Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Takahashi S. Sagara M. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. Jpn. Heart J. 1992; 33: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These differences prompted us to examine the possibility that the AGCF1 binding affinity might be affected by the naturally occurring molecular variants by using competition assays. Although the DNA-protein complex formed by AGCF1 binding to the CTC-type AGCE1 was inhibited by a molar excess of the unlabeled CTC-type AGCE1, ATC-type AGCE1 partially prevented this complex formation. In particular, the ATT-type and rodent counterparts hardly competed for this binding (Fig. 4, B andC). These results indicate that the AGCF1 binding to AGCE1 is a species-specific interaction and that the molecular variation in AGCE1 alters the AGCF1 binding affinity. AGCE1 plays an important role in mediating the responsiveness of multiple upstream and downstream cis-acting elements of the human AG gene to activate its promoter (15Yanai K. Nibu Y.K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15981-15986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As the disruption of AGCF1 binding, which resulted in the functional attenuation of the human AG regulatory elements, dramatically reduced the AG transcriptional activity (15Yanai K. Nibu Y.K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15981-15986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that the alteration of AGCF1 binding affinity caused by the three types of naturally occurring mutations affected the AG transcription (Fig.5). Although the transcriptional activity of the ATC-type in the reconstituted human AG gene (13(ATC)B2(3′)(+)) was not significantly different from that of the CTC-type, the ATT-type represented about 40% of the transcriptional activity compared with that of the CTC-type. Taken together, these results demonstrate that molecular variation of the human AG core promoter, AGCE1, affects its transcriptional activity by alteration of the AGCF1-binding activity. In the present study, we showed that AGCF1 has a DNA binding specificity similar to that of a HLH nuclear factor USF1 (26Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Gregor P.D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11985-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sawadogo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11994-12001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Furthermore, co-transfection experiments demonstrated that USF1 could regulate transcriptional activity of the human AG gene in the AGCE1-dependent manner (Figs. 2 and 3). Next, we examined the effects of naturally occurring molecular variants (CTCGTG, CTC-type; ATCGTG, ATC-type; and ATTGTG, ATT-type) localized to AGCE1 on the hAG transcriptional activity. Competitive EMSA and site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the transcriptional activity for the CTC- and ATC-type mutations was significantly higher than that for the ATT-type by alteration of the AGCF1 binding affinity (Figs. 4and 5). USF was originally described as a transcription factor derived from HeLa nuclear extract that binds to an E box of the adenovirus major late promoter (16Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). This factor is also shown to be involved in the regulation of cellular genes, including the murine metallothionein I gene (29Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the rat γ-fibrinogen gene (30Chodosh L.A. Carthew R.W. Morgan J.G. Crabtree G.R. Sharp P.A. Science. 1987; 238: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the human growth hormone gene (31Peritz L.N. Fodor E.J.B. Silversides D.W. Cattini P.A. Baxter J.D. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5005-5007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the p53 gene (32Reisman D. Rotter V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the cardiac ventricular myosin light chain 2 gene (33Navankasattusas S. Sawadogo M. van Bilsen M. Dang C.V. Chien D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7331-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, USF acts not only as a classical upstream activator, but also as a factor that interacts with initiator elements of a variety of core promoters, which can lead to markedly enhanced levels of basal transcription (34Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that human AG promoter functioned without TATA box in the presence of AGCE1 (15Yanai K. Nibu Y.K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15981-15986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This initiator-like activity of AGCE1 may be explained by the presence of USF as a component of AGCF1 (Fig. 1), because USF could activate the basal level of transcription of the human AG core promoter in the AGCE1-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Recently, Caulfied et al. (35Caulfield M. Lavender P. Farrall M. Munroe P. Lawson M. Turner P. Clark A.J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 330: 1629-1633Crossref Scopus (582) Google Scholar) have shown significant linkage between hypertension and chromosomal regions including and close to the human AG gene, but they could not confirm association with the M235T mutation as a candidate marker for essential hypertension, probably due to ethnic differences in its allele frequency. As the functional effect of the M235T on essential hypertension was unclear, Lifton (36Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8545-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) pointed out the possible existence of functional variant(s) other than this mutation at AG locus. For example, we considered that the transcriptional regulation is one of the candidate control mechanism accounting for the variation of human angiotensinogen expression and provided the functional evidence that the transcriptional activities for the CTC- and ATC-type AG promoters were 2.5 times higher than that for the ATT-type by alteration of the AGCF1 binding affinity (Figs. 4 and 5). On the basis of the present results, it is suggested that the transcriptional activities of the CTC/CTC and ATC/ATC homozygotes or the CTC/ATC heterozygote are 2.5 times higher than that of the ATT/ATT homozygote and that the CTC/ATT and ATC/ATT heterozygotes is 1.75 times higher than that of the ATT/ATT homozygote. A genetically chronic overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system could favor renal sodium reabsorption, vascular hypertrophy, and/or an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity, and predisposition to the development of common cardiovascular diseases. In this point, interestingly, associations between molecular variation of the AG gene and diseases including pre-eclampsia, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and nephropathy in insulin-dependent diabetes have been reported (37Ward K. Hata A. Jeunemaitre X. Helin C. Nelson L. Namikawa C. Farrington P.F. Ogasawara M. Suzumori K. Tomoda S. Berrebi S. Sasaki M. Corvol P. Lifton R.P. Lalouel J.M. Nat.

In addition to the systemic action of angiotensin II, the tissue function of this peptide is now considered to play an important role in local tissue regulation because components of the renin-angiotensin system have been demonstrated in a variety of tissues, such as adrenal glands, kidney, heart, and brain (43Phillips M.I. Speakman E.A. Kimura B. Regul. Pept. 1993; 43: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Since AGCF1 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, variants in AGCE1 may affect the levels of local AG synthesis, resulting in a change in the rate of angiotensin II formation. Recently, Sato et al. (44Sato N. Katsuya T. Rakugi H. Takami S. Nakata Y. Miki T. Higaki J. Ogihara T. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) performed a case-control study in Japanese population to examine whether a genetic variant in AGCE1 is directly associated with increased risk of hypertension and suggested that a part of the previously reported genetic risk of hypertension associated with M235T might be explained by an increase in transcriptional regulation of AG induced by the AGCE1 polymorphisms. As discussed to date, the statistical significance that incriminates the AG gene locus is strongly associated with human hypertension (8Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Lifton R.P.

However, there was little direct evidence regarding the mechanism by which molecular variants of the AG gene affect the regulation of AG levels. Here we presented the first clue of human AG variations associated with the alteration of their transcription regulation, providing an experimental tool or a predictive marker to probe the predisposition of this disorder.

https://openalex.org/W2025107135,"We have evaluated the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and Ca2+influx in ligand-stimulated internalization of the c-Kit receptor. The wild type (wt) c-Kit receptor and YF719, a mutant receptor in which the SH2-mediated binding site for the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase is disrupted, were expressed in DA-1 cells. YF719 internalized with similar kinetics as wt c-Kit although the receptor remained localized close to the plasma membrane. However, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, or in the presence of the competitive Ca2+ influx blocker Ni2+, the YF719 mutant failed to internalize. Failure to internalize in the absence of Ca2+ was also observed for the wt c-Kit receptor in cells that were pretreated with the PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Following stimulation with ligand, clathrin heavy chains were found to co-immunoprecipitate with c-Kit. However, under conditions in which PI3-kinase activity is inhibited and Ca2+ influx is blocked, clathrin failed to co-immunoprecipitate with c-Kit. Our results demonstrate that both Ca2+ influx and PI3-kinase activity influence c-Kit endocytosis, and inhibition of these two signals disrupts the earliest stages of ligand-mediated internalization.

CSF-1, and flt-3/flk-2 receptors. Together with its ligand steel factor (SLF), c-Kit is a key controlling receptor for a number of cell types including hematopoietic stem cells, mast cells, melanocytes, and germ cells. c-Kit is the gene product of the W locus in mice (1Huang E.

Cell. 1990; 63: 213-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Mutations in either locus severely affect the growth and survival of stem cells of these tissues. As with other receptor tyrosine kinases, stimulation of the c-Kit receptor with SLF results in the recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of SH2-containing second messenger-generating enzymes (4Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar) such as phospholipase C-γ and PI3-kinase (5Rottapel R. Reedijk M. Williams D.E. Lyman S.D.

The phosphorylated lipid products of these enzymes stimulate a variety of intracellular processes including Ca2+ mobilization and actin reorganization (7Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K.

Biomemb. 1991; 23: 7-27PubMed Google Scholar). Coincident with second messenger generation, the process of receptor internalization is also initiated. Within minutes following ligand binding, receptors cluster in dimers or oligomers and internalize by endocytosis, likely through clathrin-coated pits (10Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 11Schmid S.L. Damke H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Eventually, clathrin coats are removed, and the remaining vesicles fuse with endosomes, late endosomes, and ultimately lysosomes, resulting in receptor degradation. Numerous deletion and mutagenesis studies have been carried out to map regions of receptor tyrosine kinases required for ligand-stimulated internalization (13Lin C.R. Chen W.S. Lazar C.S.

Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and interactions with second messenger-generating enzymes have been implicated. In particular, recruitment and activation of PI3-kinase have been associated with ligand-stimulated internalization of the PDGF receptor (14Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Receptors carrying mutations within the cytoplasmic domain that disrupt the PI3-kinase-binding site are impaired in the later stages of endocytosis (25Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13225-13230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, conflicting results with a deletion mutant encompassing this binding site demonstrate no impairment in any stage of endocytosis (16Severinsson L. Ek B. Mellstrom K. Claesson W.L. Heldin C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 801-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-stimulated endocytosis of c-Kit was investigated by Yee et al. (26Yee N.S. Hsiau C.W. Serve H. Vosseller K. Besmer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31991-31998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They reported that a c-Kit mutant with no kinase activity was impaired for ligand-stimulated internalization. Individual mutations converting tyrosines 719 and 821 to phenylalanines, however, failed to affect internalization, although Phe-821 was impaired for mitogenesis (27Serve H. Yee N.S. Stella G. Sepp L.L. Tan J.C. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Tyr-719 is located in the kinase insert region of the c-Kit catalytic domain. In its phosphorylated form, it forms part of a consensus binding site for the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase and has been shown to mediate this interaction in vitro and in vivo (6Lev S. Givol D. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have also examined the role of PI3-kinase activation on ligand-stimulated internalization of c-Kit. We found that in the absence of PI3-kinase activation, the c-Kit receptor internalizes but remains localized near the inner aspect of the plasma membrane. However, when both PI3-kinase and Ca2+ influx are inhibited, clathrin fails to co-immunoprecipitate with c-Kit, and receptor internalization is completely prevented. These results show that concurrent inhibition of PI3-kinase activity and Ca2+influx disrupts the earliest stages of c-Kit internalization. gp + e NIH 3T3 packaging cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington ON) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. DA-1 cells are an interleukin-3-dependent, c-kit-negative murine lymphoma cell line (28Ihle J.N. Contemp. Top. Mol. Immunol. 1985; 10: 93-119PubMed Google Scholar). They were routinely grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 10−5m β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% supernatant from WEHI-3 cells as a source of interleukin-3. Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) were isolated and cultured as described (29Berger S.A. Mak T.W. Paige C.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for wild type (wt) murine c-kit or mutants in which tyrosine 719 was replaced with phenylalanine were cloned into the LXSN retroviral expression vector. These vectors were transferred into the gp + e NIH 3T3 packaging cells by electroporation, and transfectants were selected by growth in 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). DA-1s were co-cultured with a confluent layer of pooled gp + e transfectants for 24 h. The non-adherent DA-1s were removed and cultured for an additional 5–10 days in interleukin-3. c-Kit-positive DA-1 cells were enriched by two rounds of cell sorting (FacsStar Plus, Becton Dickinson). Surface expression of c-Kit was detected using biotinylated SLF and streptavidin-conjugated phycoerythrin (Jackson, Westgrove PA). Stable populations of c-Kit expressing DA-1s were then cloned by limiting dilution. As reported by others (6Lev S. Givol D. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we confirmed that the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase co-immunoprecipitates with c-Kit following stimulation of the wt receptor with SLF but fails to co-immunoprecipitate with YF719 (data not shown). We also confirmed that stimulation of DA-1 cells expressing wt or YF719 c-Kit receptors with SLF results in an equivalent mitogenic response (27Serve H. Yee N.S. Stella G. Sepp L.L. Tan J.C. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (data not shown), indicating that PI3-kinase activation is not essential for growth stimulation in this instance. Recombinant murine SLF was produced in soluble form in Escherichia coliusing the pFLAG.ATS isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible secretion expression vector (Invitrogen). This vector includes an eight amino acid N-terminal FLAG epitope (InterScience, Markham, ON).E. coli containing the pFLAG.ATS plasmid was incubated overnight at 37 °C in LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This culture was then diluted 20-fold and grown to an A 600 of 0.4–0.5 before being induced with 0.033 g/liter isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cultures were then incubated overnight at 37 °C before they were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The bacterial supernatant was passed through a 0.22-micron filter and stored at −80 °C with 1 mmCaCl2 and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. FLAG-SLF was purified by passing supernatants over a column of Anti-FLAG M1 mouse monoclonal antibodies covalently attached to agarose gel. The column was first equilibrated with 30 ml PBS + 1 mm CaCl2. Bacterial supernatants were then passed over the M1 column three times. The FLAG-SLF fusion protein binding to the affinity column is Ca2+-dependent; therefore, elution of FLAG-SLF can be achieved by adding EDTA. Six elutions with 1 ml of PBS + 2 mm EDTA were performed. These were collected, concentrated, and checked for purity by silver stain. SLF was also conjugated with biotin (Sigma) as described (30Hu Q. Trevisan M. Xu Y. Dong W. Berger S.A. Lyman S.D. Minden M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2530-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 1 × 106 cells of wt and YF719 DA-1 clones were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 0.5% FBS (PBS/FBS) and washed twice with the same solution. MgCl2and CaCl2, when added, were at 0.5 and 1 mm, respectively. Biotin-conjugated SLF (b-SLF) was then added to the cells in PBS/FBS at a concentration that allowed for maximal fluorescence- staining, typically 1:100 to 1:50 dilution. Cells were incubated on ice with b-SLF for 60 min. The kinetics of receptor internalization were the same whether cells were preincubated on ice or for a short time at 37 °C (not shown) indicating that the incubation on ice does not have any deleterious effects on the internalization process. Cells were incubated for various times at 37 °C and washed three times with ice-cold PBS/FBS. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice. This fixation procedure stabilized the staining pattern for several hours with little disruption of the cellular architecture. Following fixation, cells were washed three times with PBS/FBS and then incubated with streptavidin-conjugated phycoerythrin (Jackson) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice with PBS/FBS and analyzed by flow cytometry for expression and internalization of c-Kit. Actinomycin D (Sigma) stain was used to detect dead cells. These were gated out and not included in the analysis. The internalization of c-Kit was confirmed to be a ligand-dependent process using a FITC-conjugated anti-kit antibody (2B8) (Pharmingen, San Diego CA) directed at the extracellular domain of c-Kit. This antibody does not compete with SLF binding to the c-Kit receptor. Cells were either first incubated with (or without) SLF for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, washed, and then labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-kit for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry. In the absence of ligand, receptor levels did not decrease after incubation at 37 °C. However, addition of ligand caused a progressive loss of staining with the anti-kit antibody (data not shown) indicating that internalization of c-Kit is stimulated by ligand binding. 1 × 106cells of wt or YF719 DA-1 clones were resuspended in PBS + 0.5% FBS (PBS/FBS) and washed twice with the same solution. FITC-conjugated SLF was then added to the cells in PBS/FBS at a dilution of 1:100 to 1:50. Cells were incubated on ice with FITC-SLF for 40–60 min. Cells were then transferred to a 37 °C water bath for a short incubation time and then subsequently placed back on ice. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS/FBS and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice. Control experiments showed that this fixation procedure is sufficient to prevent further movement of receptor into the cell (not shown). Following fixation, cells were washed three times with PBS/FBS. Cells were then labeled with an anti-FITC antibody conjugated with Texas Red (TxR) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min on ice. Cells were washed three times with PBS/FBS and then resuspended in 5 μl of 90% glycerol containing 1,4-diazobicyclo-[2.2.2]-octane (purchased from Aldrich) which significantly reduces photobleaching (31Johnson G.D. Davidson R.S. McNamee K.C. Russell G. Goodwin D. Holborow E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 55: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to settle for 10 min on the microscope slide before applying a coverslip and nail polish. Incubation with glycerol was sufficient to immobilize the cells, while maintaining their three-dimensional structure relatively undistorted. Cells were observed by fluorescence microscope (Leitz DMR/BE) using a 100 × oil-immersion objective with filters for both FITC and TxR. Photographs were always exposed for 90 s. When cells were photographed using both filters, the Texas-Red image was exposed first since it experienced greater photobleaching. For experiments investigating the co-localization of the c-Kit receptor and SLF, cells were incubated with b-SLF and a FITC-conjugated anti-c-Kit antibody (2B8, Pharmingen) for 60 min at 4 °C either in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 0, 7.5, or 15 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS/FBS and fixed as described above. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin for 15 min at room temperature, washed, resuspended in glycerol/1,4-diazobicyclo-[2.2.2]-octane and plated on microscope slides as described above. Control experiments with a FITC-labeled isotype control antibody (Pharmingen) or streptavidin-conjugated TxR alone showed no staining (not shown). Wortmannin (purchased from Sigma) was dissolved at a concentration of 20 mm in Me2SO and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis as described above with the exception that 100 nm wortmannin was added to the binding buffer minutes before the 37 °C incubation. For c-Kit immunoprecipitations, 2.5 × 106 BMMCs per sample were starved overnight in RPMI + 0.5% FBS and then washed twice in PBS + 0.5% FBS. Cells were then incubated with 500 ng/ml SLF at 37 °C for various time points using the indicated conditions and then immediately washed twice in ice-cold PBS/FBS. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (Caledon, Georgetown ON), 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA with the following inhibitors: 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μm NaF, and 1 mm sodium molybdate (all from Sigma). Lysates were then spun at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, and supernatants were incubated with 50 μl of a 20% Protein A slurry (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and 5 μl of a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against a glutathione S-transferase kit cytoplasmic tail fusion protein or 5 μl of preimmune serum and 50 μl of a 20% Protein A slurry. 2R. Rottapel, unpublished data. A whole cell lysate prepared from 1/10th the number of cells was used as a positive control on the Western blot. All the other lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed three times in HNTG wash buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X, 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.0), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Beads were resuspended in loading buffer with β2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min, and released proteins were resolved on a 7.5% acrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked in PBS plus 5% skim milk powder and 0.5% Tween 20. Blots were incubated with an anti-clathrin monoclonal antibodies (from Transduction Laboratories, Kentucky) at a dilution of 1:5,000 overnight followed by goat anti-mouse-conjugated horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (Jackson) at a dilution of 1:2,000 and visualized with chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Blots were stripped by acid treatment and re-probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Kit antisera at a dilution of 1:500 followed by incubation with protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.) at a dilution of 1:30,000. Visualization was again by chemiluminescence. We used labeled ligand in conjunction with flow cytometry to follow the average rate of internalization over a population of cells. Labeled ligand offers the advantage of following only those receptors that are activated, unlike the use of anti-receptor antibodies that cannot distinguish between activated and unactivated receptors. Cells were incubated with b-SLF at 4 °C and then further incubated for varying amounts of time at 37 °C. Internalization was arrested by adding ice-cold PBS/FBS and shifting the cells back to 4 °C. Following washing and fixing, the cells were then incubated with Streptavidin-conjugated phycoerythrin and analyzed for surface expression. Fig. 1demonstrates typical flow cytometry profiles with b-SLF, showing a decline in the intensity of the fluorescence signal as the bound ligand is internalized with the c-Kit receptor. Recruitment and activation of PI3-kinase has been implicated in both endocytic and exocytic processes in a number of different experimental systems. We therefore investigated the ligand-stimulated internalization kinetics of both wt and YF719, a c-Kit receptor mutant that fails to recruit and activate PI3-kinase. Fig. 2 depicts the average of three flow cytometry experiments. The mean fluorescence intensity of cells that were maintained at 4 °C is denoted as 100% surface receptor expression. As shown in Fig. 2 A, wt c-Kit and the YF719 mutant expressed in DA-1 cells internalize with similar kinetics. The half-life for loss of surface label is approximately 6 min. Another early signaling event following ligand-stimulated activation of c-Kit is the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, followed by Ca2+ influx from the extracellular milieu (32Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). A number of Ca2+-binding proteins are associated with coated pits and endosomes, suggesting that high levels of intracellular Ca2+ may influence receptor endocytosis (33Mayorga L.S. Beron W. Sarrouf M.N. Colombo M.I. Creutz C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30927-30934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lin H.T. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7707-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect on receptor internalization of removing extracellular Ca2+. As shown in Fig.2 B, when Ca2+ is excluded from binding and wash buffers, wt c-Kit internalizes with kinetics similar to that observed in the presence of Ca2+; however, the YF719 receptor fails to internalize. To confirm that Ca2+ influx is required for YF719 internalization, Ni2+, a competitive blocker of Ca2+ influx channels (36Franzius D. Hoth M. Penner R. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 428: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), was added to the incubation medium containing Ca2+, and the internalization kinetics were determined. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the inclusion of 2.5 mm Ni2+ in the binding and wash buffers blocks internalization of the YF719 mutant but has little effect on the kinetics or the extent of internalization of wt c-Kit. Taken together, these results demonstrate that internalization of YF719 is dependent on Ca2+ influx. Receptor endocytosis is a multi-step process involving transfer of receptor from clathrin-coated pits, to early and late endosomes (12Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). PI3-kinase activity has been particularly associated with movement of receptor down later steps in the endocytic pathway (25Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13225-13230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the distribution pattern of internalized wt and mutant c-Kit receptors following activation with SLF using fluorescently labeled ligand and fluorescence microscopy. Cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated SLF at 4 °C to allow ligand binding. Cells were then incubated for a further period at 37 °C to allow for internalization. Following washing and fixing, the cells were further stained with anti-FITC antibody coupled with Texas Red. Because cells were not permeabilized, the anti-FITC antibody binds only those occupied receptors remaining on the surface of the cell. As shown in Fig.3 A, when wt cells are incubated with FITC-SLF at 4 °C, or for only a short time at 37 °C, the FITC and Texas Red stains are superimposable indicating that the ligand-receptor complex is on the cell surface. With longer incubations at 37 °C, the fluorescence becomes increasingly punctate, and there is an accompanying loss of Texas Red staining. Finally, after 10–15 min of incubation at 37 °C, little Texas Red fluorescence is observed, whereas the majority of the FITC staining is in large aggregates and appears to be internal to the cells. This pattern of staining is consistent with a process involving ligand-driven aggregation of the receptor, followed by internalization of the ligand-receptor complex and subsequent movement down the endocytic pathway. The receptor distribution pattern following ligand binding was also investigated for the YF719 mutant. As shown in Fig. 3 B, in the presence of Ca2+, the YF719 receptor was also observed to aggregate and internalize. However, unlike the wt receptor, the distribution pattern of the YF719 receptor remained punctate and was primarily located near the interior of the plasma membrane, even after a 15-min incubation. This suggests that although the YF719 receptor is internalizing, further movement down the endocytic pathway may be impaired. When Ca2+ was omitted from the binding and wash buffers, the wt receptor internalized and displayed a pattern of staining identical to that observed in the presence of Ca2+ and with similar kinetics (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, although the YF719 receptor was still observed to aggregate, the Texas Red and FITC stains remained co-localized on the surface of the cell (Fig. 4 B). This observation indicates that the receptor-ligand complexes are not internalizing, in agreement with our flow cytometric data which also demonstrated an inability of the YF719 receptor to internalize in the absence of Ca2+. We have extended our observations to time points as long as 30 min. At these times, the YF719 mutant still fails to internalize in the absence of Ca2+. The acidic environment of endosomes and lysosomes may, in some cases, lead to dissociation of ligand and receptor, resulting in ligand degradation and recycling of receptors back to the cell surface (37Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since we used labeled ligand to follow the fate of the SLF·c-Kit complex, it was important to verify that SLF and c-Kit remained associated in intracellular compartments. Wild type and YF719 DA1 cells were incubated with both b-SLF and a FITC-conjugated anti-c-Kit antibody at 4 °C followed by 37 °C incubations. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with streptavidin-conjugated TxR. As shown in Fig.5, after a 7.5-min incubation at 37 °C, co-localization of the TxR and FITC labels is observed for both the wt and mutant YF719 receptor, either in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. This co-localization is also observed after a 15-min incubation at 37 °C (data not shown). This observation therefore confirms that receptor and ligand remain associated during the internalization process. Our observation of impaired receptor internalization in the absence of Ca2+ for the YF719 mutant cannot distinguish between a dependence on PI3-kinase binding to the c-Kit receptor or a further requirement for PI3-kinase reaction products generated by enzymatic activation. To address this question, we performed our internalization experiments following pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of the PI3-kinase enzyme (38Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). We prepared wt DA-1 cells for either flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. Minutes before incubation of the cells"
https://openalex.org/W2326905841,"Several inherited predisposition to cancer syndromes are associated with the development of nervous system tumors. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder in which affected individuals are at risk for developing astrocytomas. One of the genes responsible for this disorder is TSC2, located on chromosome 16p, and encoding a 180 kDa protein (tuberin) that functions in part as a negative regulator of rap1. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that 30% of sporadic astrocytomas have reduced or absent tuberin expression. In addition to loss of tuberin in sporadic astrocytomas, aberrant rap1 mediated signaling may also result from overexpression of rap1. In this study, we test the hypothesis that alterations in the rap1 signaling pathway are frequently observed in certain subsets of gliomas compared to other tumors of the nervous system. Analysis of sporadic astrocytomas and ependymomas demonstrated either increased rap1 or reduced/absent tuberin protein expression in 50-60% of different cohorts of these gliomas, compared to 30-33% of sporadic schwannomas and meningiomas and none of eight oligodendrocyte tumors. These results suggest that alterations in the rap1 signaling pathway are important in the development of certain sporadic human gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2092341712,"The level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the cytoplasm is tightly regulated by two enzymes, the inositol 1,4,5,5-phosphatase and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase. Two isoforms of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase have been identified, the <i>A</i> form and the <i>B</i> form. The regulatory properties of the two isoforms were compared following overexpression and purification of the proteins from a v-<i>src</i> transformed mammalian cell line. The highly purified, recombinant inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinases were differentially regulated by calcium/calmodulin and via phosphorylation by protein kinase C or the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Both enzymes had similar affinities for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (<i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> 2–5 μm). Calcium/calmodulin stimulated the activity of isoform A about 2.5-fold, whereas the activity of isoform B was increased 20-fold. The cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase A to the extent of 0.9 mol/mol and isoform B to 1 mol/mol. Protein kinase C phosphorylated isoform A to the extent of 2 mol/mol and isoform B to 2.7 mol/mol. Phosphorylation of isoform A by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase caused a 2.5-fold increase in its activity when assayed in the absence of calcium/calmodulin, whereas phosphorylation by protein kinase C decreased activity by 72%. The activity of isoform B in the absence of calcium/calmodulin was not affected by phosphorylation using either kinase. When assayed in the presence of calcium/calmodulin, phosphorylation of isoform A by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase increased activity 1.5-fold, whereas phosphorylation of isoform B decreased activity by 45%. Phosphorylation of either isoform A or B by protein kinase C resulted in a 70% reduction of calcium/calmodulin-stimulated activity. Differential expression and regulation of the two inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase isoforms provides multiple mechanisms for regulating the cytosolic level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in cells."

https://openalex.org/W2323074787,"Growth factor stimulated receptor tyrosine kinases activate a protein kinase cascade via the serine/threonine protein kinase Raf-1. Direct upstream activators of Raf-1 are Ras and Src. This study shows that MEK1, the direct downstream effector of Raf-1, can also stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity by a positive feedback loop. Activated MEK1 mediates hyperphosphorylation of the amino terminal regulatory as well as of the carboxy terminal catalytic domain of Raf-1. The hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 correlates with a change in the tryptic phosphopeptide pattern only at the carboxy terminus of Raf-1 and an increase in Raf-1 kinase activity. MEK1-mediated Raf-1 activation is inhibited by co-expression of the MAPK specific phosphatase MKP-1 indicating that the MEK1 effect is exerted through a MAPK dependent pathway. Stimulation of Raf-1 activity by MEK1 is independent of Ras, Src and tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1. MEK1 can however synergize with Ras and leads to further increase of the Raf-1 kinase activity. Thus, MEK1 can mediate activation of Raf-1 by a novel positive feedback mechanism which allows fast signal amplification and could prolong activation of Raf-1."
https://openalex.org/W2312634433,"In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), in addition to the characteristic t(11;14)(q13;q32), rearrangements on the 3′ side of the cyclin D1 gene have been described. In a series of 32 MCL we found three cases with 3′-rearrangements by Southern blot analysis with a probe representing the 3′ untranslated region of the cyclin D1 gene. All three were characterized by the absence of the 4.5 kb transcript, and instead, two cases showed overexpression of the 1.7 kb and a third case (MCLp14) an aberrant 2.5 kb transcript. At the genomic level, fine mapping experiments showed in the 3′ untranslated region a 2 kb deletion in MCLp14 and a breakpoint in the other two cases. Fiber FISH analysis showed that in all three cases the 3′ aberration co-exists with a regular t(11;14) breakpoint 5′ of cyclin D1 on a single allele. Fiber FISH analysis of 16 additional MCL revealed two other such cases with breakpoints 5′ and 3′ of cyclin D1. These mono-allelic aberrations affecting the cyclin D1 gene suggest that the t(11;14) as a first step switches on transcription, and then sequences in the untranslated region of cyclin D1 are affected to stabilize the message."
https://openalex.org/W1968430250,"To study the role of the focal adhesion tyrosine kinase (FAK) in receptor-mediated secretion, we transfected FAK cDNA into a variant (3B6) of the RBL-2H3 mast cell line. This 3B6 cell line expressed low levels of FAK and was defective in high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) but not Ca2+ionophore-mediated secretion. FcεRI-mediated secretion was reconstituted after transfection of wild-type FAK. Histamine release was also enhanced by the stable expression of two mutants of FAK: a kinase-inactive form in which the ATP binding site Lys-454 was replaced by Arg or a mutant in which the autophosphorylation site Tyr-397 was replaced by Phe. Therefore, the catalytic activity and the autophosphorylation site of FAK are not essential for secretion. FcεRI aggregation increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of both mutants of FAK to the same extent as wild-type FAK. Therefore, tyrosine kinases activated by FcεRI aggregation are phosphorylating FAK and some of these phosphorylation sites are other than Tyr-397. These results strongly suggest that FAK plays a role in FcεRI-induced secretion by functioning as an adapter or linker molecule.

The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 1FAK, focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK; FcεRI, high affinity IgE receptor; RBL-2H3, rat basophilic leukemia cells; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a widely expressed tyrosine kinase that localizes with integrins and several proteins to intracellular sites where cells are in contact with the extracellular matrix (1Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A.

FAK also becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to the activation of various receptors including the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) and Ag receptors on T-cells (1Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A.

FAK is essential for development as the inactivation through homologous recombination of the FAK gene results in early embryonal mesodermal defects, retarded growth, and prenatal death (5Illc D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that the aggregation of FcεRI results in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, a mast cell line that has been extensively used to study FcεRI-mediated secretion (3Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor-induced phosphorylation of FAK and secretion from these cells are enhanced by adherence of the cells to fibronectin (3Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody to a ganglioside present on the RBL-2H3 cells induces many of the same intracellular reactions initiated by FcεRI aggregation but fails to result in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and does not result in secretion (7Swaim W.D.

These experiments suggest that FAK may play a role in secretion from mast cells and basophils. To further define the role of FAK in secretion, we transfected FAK cDNA into a variant of the RBL-2H3 mast cell line that expressed low levels of this kinase and had decreased FcεRI, but not Ca2+ ionophore-mediated secretion. FcεRI-induced histamine release was reconstituted in the cell lines that expressed increased levels of FAK. These studies demonstrate a function for FAK in FcεRI-mediated secretion. Full-length mouse Fak cDNA was generously provided by Dr. S. Hanks (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). pGEM-72(−) was from Promega (Madison, WI) and pBluescript was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). pSVL was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. pSV2-hph containing the hygromycin resistance gene was from ATCC (Rockville, MD). RBL-2H3 cells have been characterized previously (8Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The 3B6 cells were identified during an attempt to express in RBL-2H3 cells a chimera consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane portions of the interleukin-2α receptor fused to the intracellular portion of human β1 integrin (the plasmid CMV-IL2R described in (9LaFlamme S.E.

Expression of this chimeric protein could not be detected by either fluorescence-activated cell sorter or by immunoblotting in cloned cell lines that were resistant to G418. However, we identified two cell lines, 3B6 and 1B6, that had decreased levels of FAK. Morphologically the 3B6 cells are different from the 1B6 in that they contain what appears to be large inclusion bodies or granules. For the present studies, we used the 3B6 cell line, the one that was defective in FcεRI-mediated secretion. The 3B6 cells were cultured in medium containing 300 μg/ml (active concentration) of G418 (Geneticin). Point mutations in FAK were generated using the Muta-Gene Phagmid in vitro Mutagenesis Kit as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For point mutation of Tyr-397 to Phe (Y397F), theClaI-EcoRI fragment of FAK was subcloned in pGEM-72(−). The single strand DNA was mutated using the oligonucleotide (5′-TCTCTGCAAAGTCATC-3′). To mutate Lys-454 to Arg (K454R), the Sph-Nsi fragment was cloned in pGEM-72(−), and the single strand DNA was mutated using the oligonucleotide (5′-ACATGTTCTGATTGCA-3′). Mutagenized fragments were sequenced to confirm the mutations before subcloning into full-length FAK cDNA. Full-length FAK containing these mutations was subcloned into pSVL at the XbaI-BamHI site for use in transfection studies. pSV2-hph containing the hygromycin resistance gene was used for co-transfection. The cDNAs for wild-type or mutagenized FAK and for pSV2-hph were linearized, and the expression vector and the drug-resistant plasmid at a ratio of 10:1 (55 μg total) were incubated with 3B6 cells for 10 min on ice. After electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 960 microfarad, 310 mV in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium, cells were kept on ice for 10 min, then equal aliquots (2 × 105 cells) transferred to three 100-mm diameter tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson and Co., Lincoln Park, NJ). Selection (2 mg/ml hygromycin) was started after 48 h. Clones were identified, isolated using cloning rings and expanded for testing. For immunoblotting of whole cell lysates, cells (105 cells/well) were washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline and immediately lysed with hot sample buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol). The lysates were boiled for 30 min, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blotted with the indicated antibodies. For immunoprecipitation of FAK, 2 × 106 cells were lysed with 1% hot SDS in 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. After boiling for 30 min, the lysates were diluted 1:4 with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and mixed with 2.5 μg of the anti-FAK mAb (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and then added to 10 μg of rabbit anti-mouse Ig that had been preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A-agarose. For immunoprecipitation with other antibodies, lysates from 2 × 106 cells prepared with ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 unit/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were incubated with antibodies directly coupled to Sepharose 4B beads. For all immunoprecipitations, the lysates were incubated with the beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing, the beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteins in the eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with the indicated antibodies. Cell Activation and in vitro kinase reactions were done as described previously (3Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Hamawy M.M. Minoguchi K. Swaim W.D. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

During studies on the role of FAK in secretion in RBL-2H3 cells, a variant cell line, 3B6, was identified that expressed low levels of FAK. By immunoblot analysis, the 3B6 cells expressed 16 ± 9% (mean ± S.D., n = 3) as much FAK as RBL-2H3 cells (data not shown). The 3B6 cells were also defective in FcεRI-dependent secretion (Fig.1). FcεRI aggregation in the 3B6 cells induced a maximum histamine release of 6 ± 5% compared with 55 ± 10% (mean ± S.D., n = 7) from the RBL-2H3 cells. However, the Ca2+ ionophore-mediated histamine release was similar in the 3B6 and RBL-2H3 cells, indicating that the 3B6 cells had a normal distal degranulation pathway. By flow cytometry, the RBL-2H3 and 3B6 cells expressed similar numbers of FcεRI (data not shown). The expression levels of the key signaling tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk were also not decreased in the 3B6 cells (see below). The 3B6 cell line was stable in culture and maintained the phenotype of low FAK and defective FcεRI-mediated histamine release. For example, 26 cloned lines isolated from untransfected 3B6 cells all expressed low levels of FAK and in all the FcεRI-induced histamine release was similar to the parental 3B6 cells (data not shown). After FAK cDNA transfection into the 3B6 cells, 16 cloned cell lines were obtained. By immunoblotting of whole cell lysates, five of these cloned lines had levels of FAK that were greater than the parental 3B6; two of these cell lines were excluded from further analysis because in one the expression of FAK was unstable and decreased in culture, and the other cell line grew very slowly (the three cell lines used here are shown in Fig.2). In contrast, the level of FAK in the remaining 11 lines was similar to the parental 3B6 cells (data not shown). An additional 21 cloned lines that expressed high levels of FAK were isolated by cloning of one of the batch cultures from which the original 16 clones were derived. In the FAK transfected cell lines, the levels of the key signaling molecules Lyn and Syk and the receptor subunit FcεRIβ were similar to the parental 3B6 cells (Fig. 2). Flow cytometric analysis also indicated that the parental 3B6 cells and the FAK-transfectants expressed similar levels of FcεRI (data not shown). Therefore, by transfection, stable cell lines were isolated that had increased expression of FAK. We previously reported that FcεRI aggregation in RBL-2H3 cells increases tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (3Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hamawy M.M. Minoguchi K. Swaim W.D. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5227-5233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether aggregating FcεRI would also induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of transfected FAK (Fig.3). FcεRI aggregation in the three transfected cell lines increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, indicating that at least some of the expressed FAK participates in FcεRI-initiated signaling. FcεRI aggregation results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the β and γ subunits of the receptor and of the tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk (12Paolini R. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P.

These proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated rapidly after FcεRI aggregation at a step that is upstream of Ca2+influx. FcεRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylations of Lyn, Syk, and the receptor subunits FcεRIβ and FcεRIγ were similar in the parental FAK-deficient 3B6 and the wild-type RBL-2H3 cell lines (Fig.4 A). In the transfected cells, the increased expression of FAK did not by itself induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, Lyn, and the FcεRI subunits, nor did it affect FcεRI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig. 4 A). The general pattern of cellular phosphoproteins was also similar in the 3B6 and the FAK transfected cell lines both before and after FcεRI aggregation (Fig. 4 B). Therefore FAK is probably not involved in FcεRI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. As previous reports suggest a role for FAK in secretion, we examined FcεRI-induced histamine release in the cell lines that had increased expression of FAK (3Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Swaim W.D. Minoguchi K. Oliver C. Hamawy M.M. Kihara H. Stephan V. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19466-19473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FcεRI aggregation induced dramatically more histamine release from the FAK-transfected cell lines than from the parental 3B6 cells (Fig.5 A). In time course studies, the enhanced release was apparent within 2 min of FcεRI aggregation and was maximal by 10–15 min (Fig. 5 B). There was also similar enhancement of histamine release when FcεRI-bound IgE was aggregated by specific antigen (data not shown). Receptor-mediated histamine release was also enhanced in all the 21 cell lines that expressed high levels of FAK and that were isolated by cloning of one of the batch culture (data not shown). In contrast, FcεRI-induced histamine release was not enhanced in the 11 cloned cell lines isolated after transfection that expressed levels of FAK similar to that in the parental 3B6 cells (data not shown). Similarly, FcεRI-induced histamine release was not enhanced in the 26 cloned lines isolated by recloning the parental 3B6 (data not shown). Therefore, enhanced secretion was directly related to the expression of FAK in transfected cells. To study the function of FAK in secretion, mutagenesis was used to generate single-site replacements in the FAK molecule. A kinase-inactive FAK was produced by replacing the ATP binding site Lys-454 with an Arg (K454R) (1Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

A. 1992; 89: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). A second mutant form was produced by replacing the autophosphorylation binding site Tyr-397 with Phe (Y397F). In fibroblasts, the phosphorylation of this tyrosine creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of Src family tyrosine kinases (17Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

These mutated forms of FAK were transfected into the 3B6 cells, and cloned lines were isolated. Expression level of FAK was at least equal or greater than in RBL-2H3 cells in 12 lines from the kinase-inactive K454R mutation and in 10 lines transfected with the Y397F mutant. The results with two representative cell lines expressing each of these mutants of FAK is shown in Fig.6. By in vitro kinase reactions, both Y397F and K454R mutants of FAK did not autophosphorylate (Fig. 7). This is in agreement with previous reports that Tyr-397 is the major site phosphorylated in vitro (19Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 20Eide B.L. Turck C.W. Escobedo J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2819-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In cells expressing these mutants, the general pattern of cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylations before and after FcεRI aggregation was similar to that in the 3B6 cells (data not shown).Figure 7FAK mutants K454R and Y397F do not autophosphorylate in vitro. Cell lysates were prepared with ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer and used for immunoprecipitation with anti-FAK. After immune-complex kinase reaction, the proteins were analyzed by autoradiography (top panel) or by immunoblotting with anti-FAK mAb (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FcεRI-induced secretion was tested in the cell lines that expressed the mutated FAK at levels similar or greater than that in the RBL-2H3 cells. The release in the 12 cell lines transfected with the kinase-inactive (K454R) was 36 ± 13%, and it was 29 ± 9% (mean ± S.D.) in the 10 lines transfected with the autophosphorylation mutation. The FcεRI-induced histamine release from representative cloned cell lines expressing these two different FAK mutations is shown in Fig. 8. Although some of the cell lines transfected with the mutated forms of FAK expressed less of this protein than cells transfected with the wild-type FAK, there was still reconstitution of histamine release. In contrast to these results, histamine release was not enhanced in two cloned cell lines isolated after transfection that had levels of FAK similar to the parental 3B6 cells. These results indicate that neither the catalytic activity nor the autophosphorylation site are essential for FAK function in FcεRI-induced secretion. The enhancement of histamine release by the expression of the kinase-inactive or the autophosphorylation mutant was surprising, especially since both proteins failed to auto-phosphorylate in vitro (Fig. 7). However, FcεRI aggregation increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of both FAK mutants in vivo (Fig.9). These results indicate that cross-linking the receptor induces the phosphorylation of FAK on tyrosine residues other than Tyr-397. Furthermore, FcεRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK must be due largely to other tyrosine kinases. These results indicate that FAK plays an important role in FcεRI-mediated secretion. The reconstitution of degranulation in transfected cell lines was directly related to the increased amount of FAK in these cells. For example, FcεRI-induced histamine release was defective in over 50 untransfected and transfected cloned cell lines derived from 3B6 cells that expressed low levels of FAK. However, no direct correlation could be made between the level of wild-type FAK expression and the extent of enhancement in histamine release. For example, although there was less FAK in the transfected 3E6 than in the 2C1 and 2B4 cells (Fig. 2), histamine release was similar in all three lines and was no different than in RBL-2H3 cells (Figs. 1 and 5). However, in these three transfected lines, the amount of FAK was much greater than in the RBL-2H3 cells. Since FcεRI-induced secretion is the result of a complex cascade of reactions, increasing the level of FAK beyond a certain level may not further enhance histamine release. Transfection with the kinase-inactive FAK (K454R) indicates that the catalytic activity of FAK is not essential for FcεRI-mediated secretion. Although K454R failed to autophosphorylate in vitro, FcεRI aggregation increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of K454R in vivo. This suggests that FAK is phosphorylated by other tyrosine kinases that are activated by FcεRI aggregation. The phosphorylation of FAK by other tyrosine kinases has also been suggested by other investigators (17Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 19Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Although FAK does not have SH2 or SH3 domains, it interacts with cytoskeletal and other proteins (10Hamawy M.M. Minoguchi K. Swaim W.D. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

The tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase-inactive FAK may allow for such interactions, and therefore, the mutated FAK can still function in transducing FcεRI-initiated signals. The Tyr-397 autophosphorylation site is thought to be important for the function of FAK (17Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Src associates with FAK Tyr-397 and phosphorylates FAK on other tyrosine residues, which allows for the binding of additional proteins such as Grb2 (30Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Moll. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present experiments, the expression of the Y397F mutant in cells enhanced FcεRI-mediated secretion. Although these data rule out the importance of FAK Tyr-397 in FcεRI-mediated degranulation, they do not eliminate the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK for secretion. As with the kinase-inactive FAK, FcεRI aggregation increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of Y397F. It is possible that in Y397F other tyrosine residues may compensate for the loss of Tyr-397 and after phosphorylation bind signaling molecules that normally bind to Tyr-397. Further experiments are needed to answer these questions. Although compared with RBL-2H3 cells there was over-expression of FAK in some of the transfected cells, this increased level did not appear to have nonspecific effects. First, in these transfected cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in general was not altered. Second, as in the wild-type RBL-2H3 cells, there was enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK after FcεRI aggregation, indicating that at least some of the FAK due to transfection was a substrate for receptor-mediated signaling. Third, although FAK from the nonstimulated transfected cells was more tyrosine phosphorylated than in the FcεRI-activated RBL-2H3 cells, there was no secretion. Therefore, neither the elevated level of FAK, nor its tyrosine phosphorylation, was sufficient to initiate secretion but instead required additional signals generated by FcεRI aggregation. Although there was much more FAK in the transfected than in the wild-type RBL-2H3 cells, the extent of the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was similar to that in the RBL-2H3 cells. As discussed above, FAK appears to be a substrate for other tyrosine kinases activated by FcεRI aggregation. Therefore, the activation and/or the regulation of these kinases and not the amount of FAK may be the factor that determines the extent of the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. FcεRI-mediated secretion involves complex biochemical reactions including protein tyrosine phosphorylation (31Beaven M.A. Moore J.P. Smith G.A. Hesketh T.R. Metcalfe J.C. J. Biol.

In this pathway, the aggregation of FcεRI results in the phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic domain of the β and γ subunits of the receptor. Syk then binds to the tyrosine phosphorylated receptor subunits and is tyrosine phosphorylated and activated to propagate downstream signals including Ca2+ influx (14Hutchcroft J.E. Geahlen R.L.

First, Syk is essential for the FcεRI-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+ and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. 2J. Zhang, E. H. Berenstein and R. P. Siraganian, submitted for publication. Second, FcεRI aggregation does not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in the absence of Ca2+ in the medium. 3M. Hamawy and R. P. Siraganian, unpublished data. Third, stimulation of cells with Ca2+ ionophore increases intracellular Ca2+ and induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (3Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling pathways initiated by immune receptors on T cells, B-cells and mast cells are similar. Aggregation of these receptors initiates a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of subunits of the receptors and of several other cellular proteins (35Benhamou M. Siraganian R.P. Immunol.

Src family tyrosine kinases are thought to be important for phosphorylating the receptor subunits which then recruits Syk/ZAP70 family tyrosine kinases and leads to the activation of downstream signals. In mast cells, protein tyrosine kinases also mediate late signaling events (47Yu K.T. Lyall R. Jariwala N. Zilberstein A. Haimovich J. J. Biol.

This kinase is also present in T and B cells and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated after immune receptor activation of these cells (3Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2070069254,"During hair follicle differentiation, several families of keratin proteins are synthesized sequentially. In the present study, cDNA clones encoding six members of mouse high-glycine/tyrosine protein were isolated by screening a cDNA library prepared from the mouse skin of an anagen phase with a differential hybridization technique. On the basis of their nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, they were found to encode two members of high-glycine/tyrosine protein type I and four of type II. Interestingly, one of the four type II proteins had been encoded by two distinct cDNAs. Among the cDNA clones isolated were included the ones encoding a new member of type I and II protein, respectively, which possessed an entire open reading frame. Novel type II protein, termed type II.4, with a molecular mass of 15,130 Da was revealed to have significant direct repeats and a cysteine residue at the carboxyl terminus, which indicates that this protein has characteristics intermediate between high-glycine/tyrosine proteins and cysteine-rich proteins. In addition, the new member of type I protein has some features common with type II protein. We propose to term this protein type Iα until it is further characterized. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that gene expression of mouse high-glycine/tyrosine proteins followed the hair cycle growth fundamentally and reached its peak at day 9 in the first hair cycle, while two peaks of their expression were observed at day 33 and day 39 in the second cycle. Their transcripts were expressed in the cortical cells of hair follicles but not in the cells of the outer root sheath, inner root sheath, or medulla. Moreover, their gene expression commenced at different levels in cortical cells. The novel findings that each gene is activated transcriptionally with a distinct expression pattern spatially and temporally suggest that there is a remarkable difference in the distribution of these proteins in hair.

The novel findings that each gene is activated transcriptionally with a distinct expression pattern spatially and temporally suggest that there is a remarkable difference in the distribution of these proteins in hair. Hair is a keratinized tissue formed within the hair follicle and has a common structure composed of a cuticle sheath, an inner cortex, and a central medulla. The major structural protein of hair is keratin, which forms the rigid hair shaft by formation of a cross-linked network of keratin molecules and associated proteins. Keratin proteins are derived from several multigene families, and have been classified into intermediate filaments and intermediate filament-associated proteins (1Powell B.C. Nesci A. Rogers G.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 642: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intermediate filament-associated proteins have been classified as high sulfur (16–30% cysteine), ultra-high sulfur (>30% cysteine), and high-glycine/tyrosine proteins (HGTps) 1The abbreviation used is: HGTps, high-glycine/tyrosine proteins. 1The abbreviation used is: HGTps, high-glycine/tyrosine proteins. according to their amino acid compositions (1Powell B.C. Nesci A. Rogers G.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 642: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).HGTps are the smallest among the keratin proteins, most having molecular weights below 10,000 (2Gillespie J.M. Goldsmith L.A. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Skin. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1983: 475-510Google Scholar). They have been demonstrated to contain at least 30 components by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2Gillespie J.M. Goldsmith L.A. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Skin. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1983: 475-510Google Scholar,3Gillespie J.M. Frenkel M.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1974; 47B: 339-346Google Scholar). However, controversy exists that the apparent heterogeneity may have arisen from the conditions of protein preparation and fractionation (4.Marshall, R. C., Gillespie, J. M., Inglis, A. S., Frenkel, M. J., Proceedings of the 6th International Wool Textiles Research Conference, Ziegler, K., 2, 1980, 147, 158, Deutsches Wollforschungsinstitut, Aachen.Google Scholar). On the basis of amino acid content and solubility, these proteins were separated into two distinguishable groups, types I and II. Their amino acid compositions determined primarily from sheep exhibited that the less soluble type I group was comparatively poor in cystine but rich in phenylalanine, while the reverse was true for type II, and that both types possessed no methionine (2Gillespie J.M. Goldsmith L.A. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Skin. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1983: 475-510Google Scholar). Sheep type I has been further separated by chromatography on quaternary ammonium ethyl cellulose at pH 10.5 into two major (C and F) and eight minor components. At the present time, amino acid sequences for some sheep HGTps have been identified by the peptide mapping and sequence studies of the purified protein fractions (type I C3 and KAP6.2 corresponding to type II) (4.Marshall, R. C., Gillespie, J. M., Inglis, A. S., Frenkel, M. J., Proceedings of the 6th International Wool Textiles Research Conference, Ziegler, K., 2, 1980, 147, 158, Deutsches Wollforschungsinstitut, Aachen.Google Scholar, 5Dopheide T.A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or cloning their genes (types I C2 and F, and KAP6.1 corresponding to type II) (6Kuczek E.S. Rogers G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Fratini A. Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4511-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their sequence information showed that HGTps were enriched in glycine, tyrosine, and serine, accounting for 48–55 mol % of the amino acid content for type I and 74 mol % for type II proteins. Furthermore, the comparisons among their sequence data revealed that types I C2 and C3 were identical, and that there was a high homology between two type II proteins, KAP6.1 and 6.2. In contrast, there was no apparent homology among type I C, I F, and II proteins, except that all of them had a tyrosine residue as the C-terminal amino acid. In addition to these sheep HGTps, a gene for a type II protein has been isolated from rabbit as well. This deduced amino acid sequence showed significant identity with sheep KAP6.1, suggesting that they were evolutionarily conserved in two species.HGTps have been proposed to form the intermicrofibrillar matrix of cortex together with the high sulfur proteins. Indeed, in situ hybridization experiments using KAP6.1 cDNAs isolated from sheep and rabbit demonstrated that the transcripts of at least one type II were predominantly restricted to the cortical cells of hair follicles (7Fratini A. Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4511-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is uncertain whether the transcripts of other type II proteins are expressed similarly. On the other hand, the localization of type I transcripts in hair follicles has not yet been described.HGTps have been estimated to constitute about 19% of mouse hair protein (8Gillespie J.M. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Press, New York1990: 95-128Crossref Google Scholar). Southern blotting analysis indicated the possibility that unique types I C and F, and about 20 type II genes were present in the mouse genome (7Fratini A. Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4511-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rogers G.E. Kuczek E. Mackinnon P.J. Presland R.B. Fietz M.J. Rogers G.E. Reis P.J. Ward K. Marshall R.C. The Biology of Wool and Hair. Chapman & Hall, New York1989: 69-85Google Scholar). However, no cDNA or gene encoding mouse HGTp had been isolated. This is the first report of the isolation of the cDNAs coding for mouse HGTps. In particular, we isolated cDNA clones encoding six members of HGTp, including novel ones. In this communication, the characterization and gene expression of mouse HGTps are described in detail.DISCUSSIONHair contains three major classes of proteins, keratin intermediate filament proteins, HGTps, and cysteine-rich proteins. In the hair follicles of the anagen phase, keratin intermediate filament genes are activated initially, and subsequently expression of HGTps occurs, followed by the expression of cysteine-rich proteins (18Powell B.C. Arthur J. Nesci A. Differentiation. 1995; 58: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of all their transcripts appears to decrease significantly in telogen phase. Mouse HGTps have been determined to constitute about 19% of hair protein. Therefore, it is likely that many HGTp genes are activated, and their transcripts are expressed at high levels in mouse skin of the anagen phase, which implies that many cDNAs encoding HGTps can be isolated by differentially screening mouse skins between in the anagen and telogen phases.We isolated 13 cDNA clones encoding mouse HGTps for the first time by a differential hybridization technique. Clones were separated into seven cDNA groups according to their nucleotide sequences. Among them, five cDNA groups were determined to encode the members of mouse HGTp type II on the basis of their deduced amino acid sequences and composition, because type II protein had been estimated to be rich in cysteine and poor in phenylalanine. They have sequence identity of 53–97.4% at the amino acid level, suggesting that there is a high grade of homology in the type II subfamily. In particular, the predicted amino acid sequences of groups 1, 2, and 3 were revealed to share significant homology with each other, and interestingly, groups 1 and 2 were found to encode the same protein. Mouse HGTp types II.1 and II.2 encoded by their cDNA groups showed high amino acid sequence homology with rabbit type II protein, KAP6.1 (Fig. 1). Since this homology was more apparent in type II.1, this protein may be the mouse equivalent for rabbit KAP6.1. The comparison of the protein sequences of HGTp type II corresponding to KAP6.1 among sheep, rabbit, and mouse indicated that it was conserved highly in three species. In addition, we identified a mouse equivalent for sheep HGTp type I F, KAP8 (6Kuczek E.S. Rogers G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This protein also showed high conservation between two species (data not shown). These results raise the possibility that many HGTps as well as KAP6.1 and KAP8 are conserved evolutionarily in mammals.In the present study, two cDNAs were found out to encode new members of mouse type II proteins, termed II.3 and II.4, respectively. Type II.4, encoded by group 5 possessing an entire open reading frame, has some unique features compared with other HGTps. First, the predicted molecular mass of type II.4 is 15,130 Da, which is much larger than that of HGTps estimated generally to have molecular weight below 10,000 by chromatography on controlled pore glass in 6m urea, 0.5% SDS (19Frenkel M.J. Blagrove R.J. J. Chromatogr. 1975; 111: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and by ultracentrifugation (20Frenkel M.J. Gillespie J.M. Woods E.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Indeed, the deduced molecular weight of all HGTp cDNAs isolated is below 10,000 except for that of type II.4. Second, type II.4 is essentially composed of a tetrapeptide repeat. While mouse HGTp types II.1, II.2, II.3, and Iα, and sheep and rabbit KAP6.1 also contain some direct repeats, the frequency of their repeats is much fewer than that of type II.4. Third, type II.4 has a cysteine residue at the carboxyl terminus in which other HGTps have been confirmed to have tyrosine. Cysteine-rich proteins have been exhibited to have a molecular mass range of 10,000 to 30,000 Da (21Marshall R.C. Gillespie J.M. Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1976; 29: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of their several cDNAs or genes isolated showed that they contained several direct repeats and had cysteine at the C-terminal except for mouse serine-rich ultra-high sulfur protein 1 (22Wood L. Mills M. Hatzenbuhler N. Vogeli G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21375-21380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are enriched in either glycine or tyrosine, although HGTps have a high content of both amino acids (23Emonet N. Michaille J.J. Dhouailly D. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1997; 14: 1-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that type II.4 have intermediate characteristics between HGTps and cysteine-rich proteins.So far, two-dimensional electrophoretic study demonstrated that mouse type II proteins contain approximately 20 components (8Gillespie J.M. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Press, New York1990: 95-128Crossref Google Scholar). However, there is controversy that the apparent heterogeneity of type II proteins may be due to the conditions of protein preparation and fractionation (4.Marshall, R. C., Gillespie, J. M., Inglis, A. S., Frenkel, M. J., Proceedings of the 6th International Wool Textiles Research Conference, Ziegler, K., 2, 1980, 147, 158, Deutsches Wollforschungsinstitut, Aachen.Google Scholar). Instead, Southern blot experiment has showed that about 20 type II genes are likely to be present in the mouse genome (7Fratini A. Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4511-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we isolated five distinct cDNA groups encoding four mouse HGTp type II proteins. This suggests directly that type II proteins are derived from multiple genes, and that their heterogeneity results in part from their discrete genes. However, we still cannot exclude the possibility of the heterogeneity produced by the preparative procedures for HGTps.Additionally, another novel HGTp was encoded by the isolated cDNAs possessing an entire open reading frame. This protein has a high glycine (37.7%) and tyrosine (26.2%) content and is rich in phenylalanine (6.6%) relative to cysteine (3.3%), which suggests strongly that it belongs to type I. Sheep type I proteins have been separated into 10 components, two major amino acid sequences of which have already been reported, while those of eight minor ones have not as yet. Since the novel HGTp we isolated has no significant homology with sheep types I C and I F at both nucleotide and amino acid levels, it is likely to represent one of the minor components. Until it becomes certain to which component this protein belongs, we propose to term it HGTp type Iα. Type Iα has some features in common with type II, but types I C and F do not. Indeed, its glycine and tyrosine content is close to that of mouse type II (65.8–71.0%). In addition, it lacks 10 kinds of amino acids in its composition, compared with seven kinds in sheep types I C and F, and 12 to 13 kinds in mouse type II. Type Iα contains some direct repeats, which are found to occur in type II proteins but not in type I. The comparison of it with other HGTps revealed it to share high homology (50–63%) with sheep, rabbit, and mouse type II proteins.To further characterize mouse HGTps isolated in this study, we examined the expression patterns of their genes both in time and in space. The results from Northern blot experiments showed that the expression patterns of the transcripts of five HGTps essentially followed hair cycle growth, being similar with those of ultra-high sulfur protein and serine-rich ultra-high sulfur protein (22Wood L. Mills M. Hatzenbuhler N. Vogeli G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21375-21380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24McNab A.R. Wood L. Theriault N. Gierman T. Vogeli G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 263-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the period ranging from day 21 to 27, which covers telogen and early anagen (anagen I–III) phases, the transcripts of HGTps seemed to be either not expressed or expressed at very low levels. In the first hair cycle, the expression levels of the transcripts of five HGTps reached the peak at day 9 corresponding to anagen VI, whereas in the second cycle, two expression patterns were observed. Types Iα, II.3, and II.4 genes were activated at the highest level at day 33, the early stage of anagen VI, while types I F and II.1 genes were at day 39, the late stage of anagen VI. This result indicates that type Iα, II.3, and II.4 proteins in the second cycle are distributed more in the upper portion of hair and decrease toward the hair root, whereas types I F and II.1 are distributed reversely. In contrast, in the first cycle, five HGTps are estimated to be present more in the upper portion.The distributions of the transcripts of respective HGTps in hair follicles were examined by in situ hybridization using 9-, 33-, and 39-day-old mice, which were confirmed to be identical among three age groups. Therefore, their transcripts seem to be expressed in the respectively specific portions of hair follicles during anagen after their appearance. The transcripts of all HGTps were detected exclusively in the cortical cells of hair follicles, and this finding coincides in part with that observed in rabbit and sheep type II protein, KAP6.1, and proposes the possibility that HGTps are expressed in the cortical cells of hair follicles in mammals generally. So far, although sheep and rabbit KAP6.1 transcripts had been shown to be expressed in the cortex in some distance from dermal papilla, type I F transcripts appeared first in the cortical cells in the middle follicle bulb around the dermal papilla. This novel finding suggests that type I F is one of the HGTps transcriptionally activated closest to dermal papilla. Instead, type II.4 and Iα transcripts were detected first in the cortical cells starting to keratinize with flat nuclei, indicating that their genes are likely to be activated in the uppermost region of hair follicles among the HGTp family. It has been reported that the transcripts of rabbit cysteine-rich protein were detected first in the cortical cells about 300 μm above the follicle bulb, compared with about 200 μm measured for rabbit KAP6.1 (18Powell B.C. Arthur J. Nesci A. Differentiation. 1995; 58: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our in situhybridization results demonstrated that the transcripts of type II.4 were expressed first in the higher cortical cells than that of type II.1 corresponding to KAP6.1. This result seems to support our notion that type II.4 protein has intermediate characteristics between HGTp and cysteine-rich protein.We estimated the distributions of HGTps in mouse hair on the basis of expression patterns of their genes from Northern blot and in situ hybridization observations. As shown in Fig.8, there was a remarkable distinction of the distributions of HGTps between the hairs in the first and second hair growth cycles. In the second cycle, HGTp transcripts with the earlier peak of expression level were detected in the more distant cortical cells from dermal papilla, while those with the later one were in the closer. Accordingly, HGTps as a whole appear to be present substantially throughout hair from the tip to root. Alternatively, in the first hair cycle, HGTps increase toward the upper portion of hair, because all five HGTp genes are activated at the highest levels at day 9, the early to middle stage of anagen VI. In particular, it is interesting that the transcripts of type II.4, which has been exhibited to have unique characteristics, are expressed at the twice the level of those in the second cycle. The intermicrofibrillar matrix in the cortex has been proposed to be constituted of cysteine-rich proteins and HGTps. Cysteine-rich proteins have been presumed to stabilize the intracellular filament-matrix protein structure of hair cortical cells by forming many interpolypeptide cross-links with their abundant cysteine residues, while the role of HGTps in hair differentiation has remained to be determined. Since the pelage follicles of newborn mice are poorly developed, their first hair cycle actually represents a neogenetic event distinct in some aspects from the subsequent hair cycles (25Wilson C. Cotsarelis G. Wei Z.G. Fryer E. Margolis F.J. Ostead M. Tokarek R. Sun T.T. Lavker R.M. Differentiation. 1994; 55: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). During the first cycle, hair passes through hair canals for the first time to emerge from the skin surface. This phenomenon raises the possibility that hair in the first cycle needs to have a more rigid upper portion than that in the subsequent cycles, suggesting that HGTps are likely to relate to strengthening hair.HGTps have been confirmed to be composed of multiple members in the present study. However, we do not yet know whether there are distinct roles between HGTps expressed with the various patterns spatially and temporally during hair follicle differentiation. This study represents the first report on the isolation and the characterization of mouse HGTps. Their nucleotide sequence information will be useful to obtain HGTp genes from the mouse genome. In future, the function of each HGTp in hair follicles will be elucidated further by producing the transgenic or knock out mouse using this gene. Hair is a keratinized tissue formed within the hair follicle and has a common structure composed of a cuticle sheath, an inner cortex, and a central medulla. The major structural protein of hair is keratin, which forms the rigid hair shaft by formation of a cross-linked network of keratin molecules and associated proteins. Keratin proteins are derived from several multigene families, and have been classified into intermediate filaments and intermediate filament-associated proteins (1Powell B.C. Nesci A. Rogers G.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 642: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intermediate filament-associated proteins have been classified as high sulfur (16–30% cysteine), ultra-high sulfur (>30% cysteine), and high-glycine/tyrosine proteins (HGTps) 1The abbreviation used is: HGTps, high-glycine/tyrosine proteins. 1The abbreviation used is: HGTps, high-glycine/tyrosine proteins. according to their amino acid compositions (1Powell B.C. Nesci A. Rogers G.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 642: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HGTps are the smallest among the keratin proteins, most having molecular weights below 10,000 (2Gillespie J.M. Goldsmith L.A. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Skin. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1983: 475-510Google Scholar). They have been demonstrated to contain at least 30 components by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2Gillespie J.M. Goldsmith L.A. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Skin. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1983: 475-510Google Scholar,3Gillespie J.M. Frenkel M.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1974; 47B: 339-346Google Scholar). However, controversy exists that the apparent heterogeneity may have arisen from the conditions of protein preparation and fractionation (4.Marshall, R. C., Gillespie, J. M., Inglis, A. S., Frenkel, M. J., Proceedings of the 6th International Wool Textiles Research Conference, Ziegler, K., 2, 1980, 147, 158, Deutsches Wollforschungsinstitut, Aachen.Google Scholar). On the basis of amino acid content and solubility, these proteins were separated into two distinguishable groups, types I and II. Their amino acid compositions determined primarily from sheep exhibited that the less soluble type I group was comparatively poor in cystine but rich in phenylalanine, while the reverse was true for type II, and that both types possessed no methionine (2Gillespie J.M. Goldsmith L.A. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Skin. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1983: 475-510Google Scholar). Sheep type I has been further separated by chromatography on quaternary ammonium ethyl cellulose at pH 10.5 into two major (C and F) and eight minor components. At the present time, amino acid sequences for some sheep HGTps have been identified by the peptide mapping and sequence studies of the purified protein fractions (type I C3 and KAP6.2 corresponding to type II) (4.Marshall, R. C., Gillespie, J. M., Inglis, A. S., Frenkel, M. J., Proceedings of the 6th International Wool Textiles Research Conference, Ziegler, K., 2, 1980, 147, 158, Deutsches Wollforschungsinstitut, Aachen.Google Scholar, 5Dopheide T.A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or cloning their genes (types I C2 and F, and KAP6.1 corresponding to type II) (6Kuczek E.S. Rogers G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Fratini A. Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4511-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their sequence information showed that HGTps were enriched in glycine, tyrosine, and serine, accounting for 48–55 mol % of the amino acid content for type I and 74 mol % for type II proteins. Furthermore, the comparisons among their sequence data revealed that types I C2 and C3 were identical, and that there was a high homology between two type II proteins, KAP6.1 and 6.2. In contrast, there was no apparent homology among type I C, I F, and II proteins, except that all of them had a tyrosine residue as the C-terminal amino acid. In addition to these sheep HGTps, a gene for a type II protein has been isolated from rabbit as well. This deduced amino acid sequence showed significant identity with sheep KAP6.1, suggesting that they were evolutionarily conserved in two species. HGTps have been proposed to form the intermicrofibrillar matrix of cortex together with the high sulfur proteins. Indeed, in situ hybridization experiments using KAP6.1 cDNAs isolated from sheep and rabbit demonstrated that the transcripts of at least one type II were predominantly restricted to the cortical cells of hair follicles (7Fratini A. Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4511-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is uncertain whether the transcripts of other type II proteins are expressed similarly. On the other hand, the localization of type I transcripts in hair follicles has not yet been described. HGTps have been estimated to constitute about 19% of mouse hair protein (8Gillespie J.M. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Press, New York1990: 95-128Crossref Google Scholar). Southern blotting analysis indicated the possibility that unique types I C and F, and about 20 type II genes were present in the mouse genome (7Fratini A. Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4511-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rogers G.E. Kuczek E. Mackinnon P.J. Presland R.B. Fietz M.J. Rogers G.E. Reis P.J. Ward K. Marshall R.C. The Biology of Wool and Hair. Chapman & Hall, New York1989: 69-85Google Scholar). However, no cDNA or gene encoding mouse HGTp had been isolated. This is the first report of the isolation of the cDNAs coding for mouse HGTps. In particular, we isolated cDNA clones encoding six members of HGTp, including novel ones. In this communication, the characterization and gene expression of mouse HGTps are described in detail. DISCUSSIONHair contains three major classes of proteins, keratin intermediate filament proteins, HGTps, and cysteine-rich proteins. In the hair follicles of the anagen phase, keratin intermediate filament genes are activated initially, and subsequently expression of HGTps occurs, followed by the expression of cysteine-rich proteins (18Powell B.C. Arthur J. Nesci A. Differentiation. 1995; 58: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of all their transcripts appears to decrease significantly in telogen phase. Mouse HGTps have been determined to constitute about 19% of hair protein. Therefore"

C225R and R1066C are both associated with pancreatic insufficiency, but the former mutation is associated with mild and unusual lung disease, whereas the latter is associated with severe lung disease. In the present study, we expressed these mutants heterologously in HeLa cells, and we analyzed protein synthesis by immunoprecipitation and chloride channel function by using a halide-sensitive fluorescent dye, 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium. Immunoprecipitation and functional studies showed that cells transfected with C225R-CFTR exhibit cAMP-dependent chloride fluxes; C225R-CFTR protein is poorly expressed but fully glycosylated and can be compared with R117H-CFTR. R1066C-CFTR protein is not correctly processed and, unlike ΔF508-CFTR, this defect cannot be corrected by reduced temperature or overexpression in butyrate-treated cells; defective processing may occur at a different step in the biosynthetic pathway. These results point to two different mechanisms underlying the same pancreatic status and suggest that it is unwise to use pancreatic sufficiency and insufficiency to define mild and severe cystic fibrosis (CF) disease, respectively.

It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a cAMP-regulated chloride channel (1Riordan J. Rommens J. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R.

Since the cloning of the CF gene, few missense defects affecting the transmembrane domain have been tested for their effects on chloride channel function in heterologous cells in vitro (2Sheppard D. Rich D. Ostedgaard L. Gregory R. Smith A. Welsh M. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 3Tabcharani J. Rommens J. Hou Y. Chang X. Tsui L. Riordan J. Hanrahan J.

Travis S. Ishihara H. Welsh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14995-15001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have previously screened the entire CFTR coding regions and splice junctions to establish the spectrum of CF mutations in a sample representative of the French population and to identify new disease-causing mutations (6Fanen P. Ghanem N. Vidaud M. Besmond C. Martin J. Costes B. Plassa F. Goossens M. Genomics. 1992; 13: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). While investigating these patients, we identified two missense mutations associated with pancreatic insufficiency (PI). The first lies within the fourth putative membrane-spanning domain and the second within the fourth intracellular loop of the CFTR protein, replacing a cysteine by an arginine at position 225 and an arginine by a cysteine at position 1066, respectively (6Fanen P. Ghanem N. Vidaud M. Besmond C. Martin J. Costes B. Plassa F. Goossens M. Genomics. 1992; 13: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We thought that the switch from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic amino acid (Cys to Arg) or vice versa (Arg to Cys) would greatly affect the positioning and/or pore properties of the CFTR channel and, thus, decided to investigate the structure-function relationships of these mutants by using a heterologous expression system. Immunoprecipitation and functional analysis using a halide-sensitive indicator showed that cells transfected with C225R-CFTR exhibit cAMP-dependent chloride fluxes; C225R-CFTR protein is poorly expressed but fully glycosylated. Cells transfected with R1066C-CFTR did not respond to cAMP stimulation, and R1066C-CFTR protein was not fully glycosylated, reflecting a defect in protein biosynthesis. Contrary to ΔF508-CFTR, the defect in R1066C-CFTR transfected cells was not corrected by overexpression or a lower growth temperature. These results point to two different mechanisms underlying the same CF phenotype. A plasmid vector for human CFTR expression in mammalian cells was constructed by placing the full-length CFTR cDNA coding sequence (4.5 kb from nucleotide position 90 to 4578, obtained from pTG5960, a gift from Transgene, Strasbourg, France) in the expression vector pECE (7Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D. Edery M. Roth R. Rutter W. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid is designated pCFTRwt. Expression of CFTR in pCFTRwt is controlled by the simian virus 40 early promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pCFTRwt by using either 2-step PCR or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (TransformerTM kit, CLONTECH). Three mutants, C225R, R1066C, and R117H, were constructed. CFTR mutations were verified by DNA sequencing around the site of the mutation. Cells plated on Petri dishes (100 mm diameter) were grown at 37 °C or 24–26 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Glutamax°, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). Sodium butyrate (Sigma) was made up as a 0.5m stock solution in culture medium and was filter-sterilized (8Cheng S. Fang S. Zabner J. Marshall J. Piraino S. Schiavi S. Jefferson D. Welsh M. Smith A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L615-L624PubMed Google Scholar). It was added to the cells at a final concentration of 5 mm, 18–20 h before analysis. 60% confluent cells were transfected by lipofection using LipofectAMINETM(Life Technologies, Inc.) with 3 μg of plasmid according to the manufacturer instructions. Confluent monolayers were harvested for Northern blot analysis, functional assays, or immunoprecipitation 48 h posttransfection. 10 μg of total cellular RNA was isolated with the RNAplus system (Bioprobe system, Montreuil, France), subjected to electrophoresis on 1% MOPS-formaldehyde agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Duralon UV, Stratagene). Hybridization was performed using the 1.5-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment of CFTR-cDNA labeled by random priming (High Prime, Boehringer Mannheim). Cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h and then loaded with the halide indicator fluorescent dye 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium (MEQ). MEQ was home-made (9Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and had a Stern-Volmer constant in KCl solution of 149 m−1. The cells were incubated in hypotonic medium containing 20 mm MEQ made by diluting isotonic solution containing 138 mm NaI, 2.4 mmK2HPO4, 0.8 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 20 μm bumetanide (pH 7.4) 1:1 with water, at room temperature for 4 min (10Rommens J. Dho S. Bear C. Kartner N. Kennedy D. Riordan J. Tsui L. Foskett J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7500-7504Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and then returned to isotonic buffer to recover. 15 min after loading, the coverslip was placed in a perfusion chamber, perfused continuously at 37 °C with the isotonic iodide solution on the stage of an inverted microscope (Diaphot, Nikon, France), and measurements of intracellular MEQ fluorescence were initiated. After 2 min of perfusion, the iodide solution was replaced with nitrate solution, which was identical except that NO3− replaced I−. Because nitrate does not interact with MEQ, fluorescence increases as cell iodide flows from the cell through the anion conductive pathways if these pathways are functional in the plasma membrane. Changes in fluorescence were recorded in stimulated (stimulatory mixture: 500 μm CPT-cAMP and 100 μm IBMX) and unstimulated conditions. Excitation was at 350 nm, and emission was at >440 nm. Fluorescence in single cells was measured with a digital imaging system and a CCD camera (Photonics Sci, UK). Results were analyzed using Imstar software (Paris, France). The results were expressed as relative fluorescenceF/F 0, where F is fluorescence as a function of time and F 0minimum fluorescence. Cells were scored as positive when the rate of change in fluorescence with the stimulatory mixture was greater than that in basal conditions. We then calculated the slope of the dequenching curve in basal (ΔF basal) and stimulatory (ΔF stim) conditions and derived the ratio ΔF stim/ΔF basal. We chose this ratio rather than the absolute change in fluorescence as the latter may be influenced by dye loading. When appropriate, results are expressed as means ± S.D. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 24–1 (Genzyme, Framingham, MA), which recognizes the C terminus of CFTR, according to the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, cell lysates were prepared with 2 × 106 butyrate-treated or 4 × 106untreated cells and immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of mAb 24–1 and Pansorbin (Calbiochem). The resulting proteins were phosphorylatedin vitro with 5 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Promega) and 10 μCi [γ-33P]ATP and were then separated on 5% SDS-PAGE, dried, and autoradiographed. Three mutated CFTR proteins (C225R-, R1066C-, and R117H-CFTR) and wild-type CFTR were transiently expressed in HeLa cells and analyzed at the mRNA, protein, and functional levels. Wild-type and R117H-CFTR were used as controls since both proteins are processed to the plasma membrane and function as cAMP-regulated chloride channels (3Tabcharani J. Rommens J. Hou Y. Chang X. Tsui L. Riordan J. Hanrahan J. Nature. 1993; 366: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Anderson M.P. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 251: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To check the transfection efficiency, we first used Northern blot analysis to verify that transcripts for wild-type and mutated CFTR were present in transfected cells (Fig.1 A, 5 lanes from left). Then, we performed immunoprecipitation/PKA assay to determine the protein glycosylation pattern. Fig. 1 B shows that the fully processed form of wild-type CFTR protein was detected in HeLa cells as a diffuse band of approximate molecular mass of 170 kDa (band C) and that the core-glycosylated form appeared as a thin band of about 140 kDa (band B) on 5% SDS-PAGE; the pattern was almost identical for R117H-CFTR. C225R-CFTR expression showed a faint band C or B, indicating that some mutant protein matured and reached the cell surface. R1066C-CFTR produced a low level of core-glycosylated CFTR as a faint band B, suggesting a low level of synthesis and defective biosynthesis (Fig. 1 B). To increase the sensitivity of the assay, CFTR protein expression was increased with 5 mm sodium butyrate treatment for 18–20 h. Sodium butyrate stimulates the transcriptional activity of several viral and nonviral genes (12Kruh J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 42: 65-82PubMed Google Scholar) and acts on the SV40 promoter of the expression vector used in this study. The intensity of bands C and B of wild-type, R117H- and C225R-CFTR increased markedly, and the ratio of bands C/B was similar in treated wild-type, R117H-, and C225R-CFTR cells. Although synthesis of R1066C-CFTR increased markedly with sodium butyrate (strong band B), we did not detect a mature band C, suggesting that this mutant cannot function as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel (Fig. 1 B). To determine if R1066C was a temperature-sensitive mutant of CFTR, cells were grown at 24–26 °C for 48 h and harvested for immunoprecipitation-PKA assay; ΔF508 was used as control as it has been shown that a reduced growth temperature permits maturation and delivery to the plasma membrane (13Denning G. Anderson M. Amara J. Marshall J. Smith A. Welsh M. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). No fully glycosylated CFTR (band C) protein was detected when R1066C-CFTR transfected cells were grown at 24–26 or 37 °C, whereas band C appeared when ΔF508-CFTR cells were grown at 24–26 °C (Fig. 1 C). Thus, neither butyrate treatment nor low temperature rescued R1066C-CFTR. To test cAMP-activated chloride conductance activity, transfected cells were analyzed using the MEQ fluorescence assay. None of the mock-transfected cells (n = 60) showed changes in fluorescence in either basal or cAMP-stimulated conditions. Transiently transfected cells were divided into responsive and nonresponsive cells on the basis of cAMP-responsive anion conductance. Responsive cells were further divided into fast (ΔF stim/ΔF basal > 5) and slow (ΔF stim/ΔF basal ≤ 5) responsive cells. 30% of wild-type transfected cells (n = 200) were responsive, and 50% of these positive cells were fast responsive (Table I). Similar results were obtained with R117H-transfected cells (33% being fast responsive and 66% slow responsive cells) supporting the immunoprecipitation data, which suggested that wild-type and R117H-CFTR activate a cAMP-regulated chloride pathway. When exposed to the stimulatory mixture, 8% of C225R-CFTR cells showed an increased rate of change in MEQ fluorescence, indicating the activation of a cAMP-dependent anion pathway. All these cells were slow responsive. None of the R1066C-CFTR cells (n = 100) exhibited an increase in MEQ fluorescence when exposed to the stimulatory mixture (Fig. 2 C), supporting the notion that only fully glycosylated CFTR is functional.Table ISummary of the MEQ assay resultsCell typeWild-typeR117HC225RR1066CC225R + NaB1-dNaB, pretreated with sodium butyrate.R1066C + NaB1-dNaB, pretreated with sodium butyrate.pECEAll responding60 (30)1-aPercentage of all cells.9 (16)1-aPercentage of all cells.8 (8)1-aPercentage of all cells.011 (22)1-aPercentage of all cells.00Fast30 (50)1-bPercentage of positive cells.3 (33)1-bPercentage of positive cells.003 (27)1-bPercentage of positive cells.00ΔFstim/ΔF basal13.5 ± 6.81-cMean values ± S.D.8 ± 1.71-cMean values ± S.D.22.3 ± 7.11-cMean values ± S.D.Range6–276–916–30Slow30 (50)1-bPercentage of positive cells.6 (66)1-bPercentage of positive cells.8 (100)1-bPercentage of positive cells.08 (73)1-bPercentage of positive cells.00ΔF stim/ΔF basal3.4 ± 1.01-cMean values ± S.D.2.4 ± 0.51-cMean values ± S.D.2.9 ± 1.41-cMean values ± S.D.3.4 ± 1.01-cMean values ± S.D.Range2–52–31.5–51.5–5Total200561001005050601-a Percentage of all cells.1-b Percentage of positive cells.1-c Mean values ± S.D.1-d NaB, pretreated with sodium butyrate. Open table in a new tab To determine if increased protein synthesis influenced the function of the C225R and R1066C mutants, we pretreated cells with 5 mmsodium butyrate for 18–20 h. R117H- and wild-type-CFTR were not tested since they were fully responsive in untreated conditions. After treatment with butyrate, 22% of C225R-CFTR cells were responsive; of these, 27 and 73% were fast and slow responsive, respectively (TableI). Thus, butyrate treatment increased the number of responsive cells and unmasked the full response. These results strengthen the conclusion that C225R-CFTR protein is correctly processed to the plasma membrane. Sodium butyrate treatment of R1066C-CFTR cells (n = 50) induced no change in MEQ fluorescence, indicating that butyrate treatment cannot overcome the defective function of this mutant. Representative data are shown in Fig. 2, A-C, and the mean values of slopes of fluorescence dequenching are shown in Table I. We analyzed the structure-function relationships of two mutations, C225R and R1066C, that we had identified in CF patients with pancreatic insufficiency (6Fanen P. Ghanem N. Vidaud M. Besmond C. Martin J. Costes B. Plassa F. Goossens M. Genomics. 1992; 13: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and compared the properties of those mutations with those of wild-type-CFTR and R117H-CFTR. C225R was found in a compound heterozygote for the ΔF508 mutation and was associated with pancreatic insufficiency, normal lung function, and asthma. R1066C was first found in a patient bearing the ΔF508 mutation on the other chromosome. Six unrelated patients bearing the R1066C mutation have since been identified. Five patients had pancreatic insufficiency while the sixth had normal pancreatic function and was a compound heterozygote for a mild mutation (D110H) (14Dean M. White M.B. Gerrard B. Stewart C. Khaw K.-T. Leppert M. Cell. 1990; 61: 863-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Six CF-associated mutations (P99L, R117H, P205S, R334W, R347P, and R347H) located in putative membrane-spanning domains that have already been analyzed for their functional properties (2Sheppard D. Rich D. Ostedgaard L. Gregory R. Smith A. Welsh M. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 3Tabcharani J. Rommens J. Hou Y. Chang X. Tsui L. Riordan J. Hanrahan J.

Travis S. Ishihara H. Welsh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14995-15001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were all associated with a mild phenotype (pancreatic sufficiency, PS). To our knowledge, this is the first reported expression of the C225R-CFTR mutant and the first description of a transmembrane mutant associated with a severe phenotype (PI). Heterologous expression of this mutant in HeLa cells showed that C225R-CFTR protein elicited cAMP-dependent chloride fluxes. It thus seems that the pancreatic insufficiency associated with the C225R mutation cannot be fully explained by defective chloride conduction through the mutant CFTR protein. The processing of C225R-CFTR resembles that of R117H-CFTR. This latter mutant, in which the substitution lies in the second putative membrane-spanning domain, is correctly processed and generates a reduced cAMP-regulated apical membrane chloride current (2Sheppard D. Rich D. Ostedgaard L. Gregory R. Smith A. Welsh M. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Both mutants are associated with mild lung disease, but R117H is associated with PS whereas C225R is associated with PI. We think that it is unwise to use pancreatic sufficiency and insufficiency to define mild and severe CF disease, respectively. Regarding the second mutant studied here, R1066C-CFTR, no cAMP-activated anion conductance was found in cells expressing this protein and no mature protein was detected. This probably reflects defective CFTR biosynthesis and/or incorrect delivery to the plasma membrane. During the course of this study, heterologous expression of R1066C-CFTR was reported by others using different expression systems (15Seibert F. Linsdell P. Loo T. Hanrahan J. Clarke D. Riordan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15139-15145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Cotten J.F. Ostedgaard L.S. Carson M.R. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21279-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our results are in keeping with the report by Seibertet al. R1066C is a class II mutation in the classification proposed by Welsh and Smith (17Welsh M. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). The functional defect of ΔF508-CFTR, another class II mutant, can be corrected by overexpression of the mutated protein (8Cheng S. Fang S. Zabner J. Marshall J. Piraino S. Schiavi S. Jefferson D. Welsh M. Smith A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L615-L624PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike ΔF508-CFTR, R1066C-CFTR protein cannot bypass the “quality control” of the endoplasmic reticulum when grown at reduced temperature or when overexpressed in butyrate-treated cells; defective processing may thus occur at a different step in the biosynthetic pathway. Taken together, the immunoprecipitation and functional assay results suggest that lipofection of a CFTR cDNA under the control of an SV40 promoter in HeLa cells mimics the biosynthetic pathway of human lung cells but not human pancreatic cells in vivo. This experimental model might be helpful to predict the lung status of CF patients bearing mutations located in putative membrane-spanning domains of CFTR protein. At the molecular level, cysteine replacement, as in C225R and R1066C, may lead to the disruption or creation of disulfide bonds between cysteines and thereby change the channel properties. Thus, a new class of mutations may be defined on the basis of the presence (or absence) of these bonds. The results of our study support Sheppard's view that “it is not possible to predict the mechanism of dysfunction of CFTR based solely on the site of mutation” (5Sheppard D. Travis S. Ishihara H. Welsh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14995-15001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and further demonstrate that it is difficult to predict the phenotype on the basis of the mechanism of dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2041626979,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) is a cytotoxic/cytostatic compound for a variety of human cancer cells. The p21WAF1 protein is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) that binds to cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes and inhibits their kinase activities, thereby leading to cell cycle arrest. We found that the cytostatic effect of TNFalpha on the cervical cancer cell line, ME180, was concomitant with an arrest of these cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell-cycle. This corresponded with an increase in both p21WAF1 mRNA and protein levels which likely occurred via a p53-independent pathway since ME180 is infected with the human papilloma virus. To elucidate the role of p21WAF1 in the TNFalpha-mediated growth and cell cycle arrest, we stably transformed ME180 cells with an antisense p21WAF1 expression vector. Two clones with reduced levels of p21WAF1 both in their basal state as well as after their exposure to TNFalpha were selected. The growth of these cells was still inhibited by TNFalpha and they arrested in G0/G1 similar to wildtype or empty vector transfected cells. These results indicate that although p21WAF1 expression increases dramatically with TNFalpha treatment, it may not play a critical role in the cytostatic effect of TNFalpha on ME180 cervical cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2333772978,"OCI-5/Glypican 3, a member of the glypican family of proteoglycans, is the defective gene in the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel overgrowth syndrome. OCI-5 expression is developmentally regulated in the intestinal epithelium, and the mechanism of its regulation was studied in the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-18. A large induction of OCI-5 transcript and protein was observed at high cell density. Among other glypican family members, κ-glypican also exhibited a confluence-dependent induction in select cell types. Nuclear run-on analysis indicated that cell-density regulation of OCI-5 occurs at the level of transcription. The rat and mouse OCI-5 promoters were cloned and found to be highly conserved, located within CpG islands and contain regions of alternating purine and pyrimidine residues. No TATA-box or recognizable INR element was observed. Consensus binding sites for AP-2, SP-1, zeste and NF-1/CTF are conserved across human, mouse and rat promoters. 5′ deletion mapping of the rat promoter identified regions which enhance and repress promoter activity, with no apparent confluence-dependence or tissue-specificity. Nuclear run-on analysis probing different regions of the gene suggests that elongation control plays a role in the induction of OCI-5 by confluence."
https://openalex.org/W2322438976,"Functional PDGFα receptors are selectively expressed on highly lung-metastasizing clones of the 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma, but not on low-mestastatic clones. The highly metastatic clones are also growth induced in vitro by PDGF and lung conditioned medium. To investigate whether modification of PDGFα receptor expression or function can affect metastatic capability, we transfected cells of a low-metastatic 3LL clone with a full length PDGFα receptor gene and cells of a highly-metastatic clone with a truncated kinase domain PDGFα receptor gene. Introduction of the full length PDGFα receptor conferred upon low-metastatic cells the ability to grow in vitro in the presence of PDGF-AA and to colonize the lung in experimental and spontaneous metastases assays. Conversely, introduction of a truncated version of the PDGFα receptor into highly metastatic cells reduced their metastatic load to control levels. Accordingly, their responses to PDGF-AA, including growth stimulation and receptor autophosphorylation, were reduced. These results demonstrate that PDGFα receptor expression and function can control the capacity of tumor cells to generate metastases in the lung. The response of this receptor to lung-derived PDGF-like factors may define a paracrine mode of metastatic cell growth in the target organ."
