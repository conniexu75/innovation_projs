https://openalex.org/W1667463872,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a newly described leukocyte chemotactic and activating cytokine that belongs to the novel family of inflammatory cytokines whose genes locate on human chromosome 4, q12-21 region. The production of IL-8 is usually not constitutive and can be induced rapidly and abundantly in different cell types by a variety of stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha as well as a tumor promotor phorbol myristate acetate. We report here that in addition to these stimuli the IL-8 gene can also be induced by the protein X of the hepatitis B virus (HBV-X) as evidenced by the enhanced IL-8 mRNA expression and IL-8 production observed in HBV-X-transfected cells. Furthermore, using several deletion mutants of the 5'-flanking regulatory region of the human IL-8 gene linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene as a reporter, we have established here that both nuclear factor kB and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-like cis-elements located at -94 to -71 base pairs of IL-8 gene are essential and sufficient for the induction of the IL-8 gene by HBV-X. The same elements have been identified recently by us to be interleukin-1-, tumor necrosis factor-alpha-, and phorbol myristate acetate-responsive elements on the IL-8 gene. This suggests the existence of a common pathway for these inflammatory cytokines and HBV-X to activate the IL-8 gene. These observations might be relevant to the pathogenesis of inflammation in viral hepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W1562852007,"The substrate analogue conduritol B epoxide (CBE) is demonstrated to be an active site-directed inhibitor of human lysosomal alpha-glucosidase. A competitive mode of inhibition is obtained with glycogen as natural and 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside as artificial substrate. The inactivation of the enzyme is time and concentration dependent and results in the covalent binding of CBE. Catalytic activity is required for binding to occur. CBE-labeled peptides containing the catalytic residue of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase were isolated and identified by microsequencing and amino acid analysis. The peptides appeared to originate from a protein domain which is highly conserved among alpha-amylases, maltase, glucoamylases, and transglucanosylases. Based on the sequence similarity and the mechanism of CBE binding, Asp-518 is predicted to be the essential carboxylate in the active site of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase. The functional importance of Asp-518 and other residues around the catalytic site was studied by expression of in vitro mutagenized alpha-glucosidase cDNA in transiently transfected COS cells. Substitution of Asp-513 by Glu-513 is shown to interfere with the posttranslational modification and the intracellular transport of the alpha-glucosidase precursor. The residues Trp-516 and Asp-518 are demonstrated to be critical for catalytic function."
https://openalex.org/W1484657725,"We have investigated the question of whether the gel mobility-shift assay can provide data that are useful to the demonstration of cooperativity in the site-specific binding of proteins to DNA. Three common patterns of protein-DNA interaction were considered: (i) the cooperative binding of a protein to two sites (illustrated by the Escherichia coli Gal repressor); (ii) the cooperative binding of a bidentate protein to two sites (illustrated by the E. coli Lac repressor); and (iii) the cooperative binding of a protein to three sites (illustrated by the lambda cI repressor). A simple, rigorous, and easily extendable statistical mechanical approach to the derivation of the binding equations for the different patterns is presented. Both simulated and experimental data for each case are analyzed. The mobility-shift assay provides estimates of the macroscopic binding constants for each step of ligation based on its separation of liganded species by the number of ligands bound. Resolution of the binding constants depends on the precision with which the equilibrium distribution of liganded species is determined over the entire range of titration of each of the sites. However, the evaluation of cooperativity from the macroscopic binding constants is meaningful only for data that are also accurate. Some criteria that are useful in evaluating accuracy are introduced and illustrated. Resolution of cooperative effects is robust only for the simplest case, in which there are two identical protein binding sites. In this case, cooperative effects of up to 1,000-fold are precisely determined. For heterogeneous sites, cooperative effects of greater than 1,000-fold are resolvable, but weak cooperativity is masked by the heterogeneity. For three-site systems, only averaged pair-wise cooperative effects are resolvable."
https://openalex.org/W2161782689,"Proteinase inhibitors in the serpin family form complexes with serine proteinases by interactions between the gamma-OH group at serine 195 of the enzyme and a specific peptide bond within the reactive site loop of the inhibitor. However, the type of complex formed (i.e. Michaelis, acyl, or tetrahedral) is unknown. Until now, 13C NMR spectroscopy studies have only been useful in examining complexes formed with either peptide-related or small protein inhibitors, where 13C-labeled amino acids can be inserted semi-synthetically. Recombinant DNA technology has, however, made it possible to specifically enrich larger proteins with 13C. In the case of serpins we have examined the structure of the complex formed between human alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor uniformally labeled with [13C]methionine and porcine pancreatic elastase. 13C NMR spectroscopic studies revealed a large upfield chemical shift of the carbonyl signal of Met-358 upon complex formation suggesting for the first time that a tetrahedral adduct is formed between a serpin inhibitor and a serine proteinase."
https://openalex.org/W1570594834,"Strand exchange protein 1 (Sep1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyzes the formation of heteroduplex DNA molecules from single-stranded circles and homologous linear duplex DNA in vitro. Previously, Sep1 was purified as a 132,000-Da species; however, DNA sequence analysis indicates that the SEP1 gene is capable of encoding a 175,000-Da protein (Tishkoff, D.X., Johnson, A.W., and Kolodner, R.D. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 2593-2608). The SEP1 gene was cloned into a GAL10 expression vector and expressed in a protease-deficient yeast strain. Intact Sep1, which migrated as a Mr-160,000 polypeptide during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was purified to apparent homogeneity and shown to have activities similar to those of the originally purified Mr = 132,000 fragment. We report here that, in addition to strand exchange activity, Sep1 contains an intrinsic exonuclease that is active on single- and double-stranded DNA with a severalfold preference for single-stranded DNA. The nuclease was induced in crude extracts upon induction with galactose, it co-purified with the strand exchange activity of Sep1, and the nuclease and strand exchange activities of Sep1 showed the same kinetics of heat inactivation. Sep1 nuclease, which requires Mg2+, can be functionally separated from the strand exchange activity by the substitution of Ca2+ for Mg2+. Under these conditions, the nuclease is inactive, and strand exchange activity is dependent on prior resection of the DNA ends by an exogenous exonuclease. Thus, the nuclease is necessary for synapsis but not strand exchange. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that true strand exchange products, alpha molecules and nicked double-stranded circular molecules, were formed. In addition, strand transfer proceeded to similar extents on 5'-resected and 3'-resected DNA. This result suggests that the polarity of strand transfer by Sep1 is determined by the polarity of its intrinsic nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1562555406,"The gallbladder bile of patients with cholesterol gallstones contains pronucleating proteins which accelerate precipitation of cholesterol crystals from bile. In this study we have improved the purification procedure developed earlier for these nucleating proteins and have now identified the nature of these proteins. Gallbladder bile from patients with cholesterol gallstones was applied to concanavalin A affinity columns. The ConA-binding glycoprotein fractions containing the nucleating proteins were then separated by FPLC (fast protein liquid chromatography) using a Superose 12 gel filtration column. Nucleating activity was detected in the high molecular weight (FPLC-1) as well as in the low molecular weight fractions (FPLC-3). Investigation of the high molecular weight fraction by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroelution and amino acid sequencing suggested that these proteins were immunoglobulins. Immunostaining of Western blots with specific monoclonal antibodies identified the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgA in the FPLC-1 fraction. These immunoglobulins were further purified by affinity chromatography employing an antibody exchanger (ABx) column which specifically binds immunoglobulins. There was no reduction in the cholesterol nucleating activity in the Abx-bound fraction compared to FPLC-1. Additional studies showed that the FPLC-1 fraction was significantly more potent than the ConA glycoproteins from either rapid and slow nucleating biles. Also the number of crystals formed was significantly greater in the FPLC-1 fraction isolated from cholesterol gallstone biles than from the FPLC-1 fraction from control patient biles. Commercially obtained IgM and IgA had no effect on nucleation, but IgM isolated from the serum of patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia did accelerate the nucleation of cholesterol. We conclude that the IgM and possibly IgA are pronucleating proteins and may be important in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones in man."
https://openalex.org/W1495788181,"Ligand-induced oligomerization is a universal phenomenon among growth factor receptors. Although the mechanism involved is yet to be defined, much evidence indicates that receptor oligomerization plays a crucial role in receptor activation and signal transduction. Here we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) is able to stimulate the oligomerization of a recombinant, soluble, extracellular ligand-binding domain of EGF receptor. Covalent cross-linking experiments, analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography, and electron microscopy demonstrate that receptor dimers, trimers and larger multimers are formed in response to EGF. This establishes that receptor oligomerization is an intrinsic property of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of EGF receptor. Ligand-induced conformational change in the extracellular domain will stimulate receptor-receptor interactions. This may bring about the allosteric change involved in signal transduction from the extracellular domain across the plasma membrane, resulting in the activation of the cytoplasmic kinase domain. Electron microscopic images of individual extracellular ligand-binding domains appear as clusters of four similarly-sized stain-excluding areas arranged around a central, relatively less stain-excluded area. This suggests that the extracellular ligand-binding domain is structurally composed of four separate domains."

https://openalex.org/W1528450945,"Residue 39 of serine proteases neighbors positions P'2 to P'4 of the substrate. When Glu-39 of thrombin is replaced with Lys, the resultant enzyme (E39K) retains similar P1, P2, and P3 specificities but has altered P'3 and/or P'4 specificities. These conclusions are based on analysis of both p-nitroanilide and synthetic peptide hydrolysis. The activity of E39K is nearly normal toward 17 p-nitroanilide substrates. In peptide substrates, an acidic residue at either the P3 or P'3 position reduces the rate of cleavage by thrombin. A single substitution of Asp with Gly in either the P3 or P'3 position of a peptide corresponding to the P7-P'5 residues of protein C increases the rate of cleavage by thrombin 2-3-fold. Replacement of both Asp residues with Gly increases the rate of cleavage 30-fold. With E39K, the inhibitory effect of Asp in P3 remains unchanged, but Asp in the P'3 site is no longer inhibitory. Significant differences in the catalytic activity of E39K are also seen with respect to protein C activation. In the absence of thrombomodulin, E39K activates protein C 2.2 times faster than thrombin. In the presence of thrombomodulin, the rate of protein C activation is similar for E39K and thrombin. The second order rate constant of inhibition by antithrombin III, where P'4 is a Glu, is slightly increased (1.4-fold). The clotting activity is reduced 2.4-fold due to a lower rate of fibrinopeptides A and B release where P'3 is Arg. These data show that the P'3 position is a determinant of thrombin specificity and suggest that thrombomodulin may function in part by alleviating the inhibitory effects that may arise from the proximity of the Asp in P'3 of protein C with Glu-39 of thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1563533230,"A potential casein kinase II (CK II) recognition site is located within the conserved carboxyl (COOH) terminus of the ribosomal P (phospho) proteins P0, P1, and P2. To determine whether the COOH termini of the P proteins are physiological substrates for CK II, we studied the phosphorylation of the P proteins in vitro and in intact cells. The results show that the addition of exogenous purified CK II and ATP to intact ribosomes in vitro resulted in the relatively selective phosphorylation of all three P proteins. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 22 amino acids of P2 (C-22) was also phosphorylated by CK II with a Km of 13.4 microM. An endogenous ribosome-associated, CK II-like enzyme also phosphorylated the P proteins relatively selectively in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ and ATP. The endogenous kinase was inhibited by heparin, utilized either ATP or GTP as a phosphate donor, and phosphorylated casein. A CK II-specific peptide (Arg-Arg-Arg-Glu-Glu-Glu-Thr-Glu-Glu-Glu) and the C-22 peptide inhibited the phosphorylation of the P proteins by the endogenous kinase, providing further evidence for its CK II-like properties and for localization of the CK II phosphorylation site to the COOH termini of the P proteins. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps of P1 and P2 phosphorylated by exogenous CK II and the endogenous ribosome-bound kinase were virtually identical. These phosphopeptides comigrated with the tryptic digest of C-22 and with the tryptic phosphopeptides derived from P1 and P2 isolated from intact cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in vivo. These studies demonstrate that exogenous CK II and a ribosome-bound, CK II-like enzyme phosphorylate the ribosomal P proteins in vitro and localize the target site for phosphorylation to the COOH terminus. The incorporation of phosphate into the same target site in intact cells indicates that the P proteins are in vivo substrates of CK II."
https://openalex.org/W176847937,"Results presented in this study demonstrate that a mutation which inserts an additional tyrosine between the 2 tyrosines at residues 118 and 119 of mature LamB protein results in a temperature-dependent assembly defect. This defect leads to the accumulation of an intermediate at the restrictive temperature that is most likely an assembly-defective monomer. These monomers are rapidly degraded in the wild type (htrA+) strain, and the biphasic kinetics of this degradation indicate that the mutation affects the assembly process and not the final product, i.e. stable trimers. In addition, our data show that the temperature-dependent assembly defect in the mutant strain is reversible, and therefore the accumulated monomers represent a true assembly intermediate. Fractionation studies show that the monomers, which can be accumulated in htrA (degP) mutants at the restrictive temperature, are associated with the outer membrane, indicating that trimerization of LamB is not a prerequisite for localization."
https://openalex.org/W1493322933,"Abstract In vitro refolding after urea unfolding of the enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1) normally requires the assistance of detergents or chaperonin proteins. No efficient, unassisted, reversible unfolding/folding transition has been demonstrated to date. The detergents or the chaperonin proteins have been proposed to stabilize folding intermediates that kinetically limit folding by aggregating. Based on this hypothesis, we have investigated a number of experimental conditions and have developed a protocol for refolding, without assistants, that gives evidence of a reversible unfolding transition and leads to greater than 80% recovery of native enzyme. In addition to low protein concentration (10 micrograms/ml), low temperatures are required to maximize refolding. Otherwise optimal conditions give less than 10% refolding at 37 degrees C, whereas at 10 degrees C the recovery approaches 80%. The unfolding/refolding phases of the transition curves are most similar in the region of the transition, and refolding yields are significantly reduced when unfolded rhodanese is diluted to low urea concentrations, rather than to concentrations near the transition region. This is consistent with the formation of sticky intermediates that can remain soluble close to the transition region. Apparently, nonnative structures, e.g. aggregates, can form rapidly at low denaturant concentrations, and their subsequent conversion to the native structure is slow."
https://openalex.org/W2110973514,"The central region of smooth muscle caldesmon is predicted to form alpha-helices on the basis of its primary structure. We have isolated a fragment (CT54) that contains this region. The hydrodynamic properties and the electron microscopic images suggest that CT54 is an elongated (35 nm), monomeric molecule. The circular dichroic spectrum yields an overall alpha-helical content of 55-58%. These results are consistent with the model that the middle portion of CT54 forms a long stretch of single-stranded alpha-helix. Such a structure, if it in fact exists, is thought to be stabilized by numerous salt bridges between charged residues at positions i and i + 4. The structural characteristics of this fragment not only represent an unusual protein configuration but also provide information about the functional role of caldesmon in smooth muscle contraction."
https://openalex.org/W1527303490,"Sterol-dependent regulation of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase promoter was previously localized to a 42-base pair region containing an octamer sequence, referred to as the sterol regulatory element (SRE-1). A similar motif is found in the region of DNA that is required for sterol-dependent regulation of the HMG-CoA synthase and low density lipoprotein receptor genes. Single nucleotide substitution analyses of the low density lipoprotein receptor and HMG-CoA synthase promoters confirmed that the SRE-1 is an important sterol regulatory motif. In the current studies, a series of single nucleotide mutations were introduced into the HMG-CoA reductase regulatory region and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. RNA produced by each mutant promoter was then measured in the presence or absence of sterols. Thirty-seven independent mutations were analyzed, and two separate domains were identified as being critical. One essential region was spread over 10 bases and contained half of the SRE-1; however, the other half of the SRE-1 was not important for sterol regulation. The second essential region spanned four contiguous bases. These two critical elements are separated from each other by three nonessential bases. The results are interpreted to suggest that regulation of HMG-CoA reductase gene transcription by sterols requires additional or possibly separate factors from those required for sterol regulation of the low density lipoprotein receptor and HMG-CoA synthase promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2164506510,"Endogenous digoxin-like immunoreactive factors (DLIF) are present in serum and tissues of humans and animals. To date, a tissue source for these factors has not been rigorously defined nor have these factors been isolated to identifiable homogeneity. In this study, we define the distribution of DLIF in mammalian tissues, demonstrate the adrenal cortex to be the principal source of this factor in bovine, and isolate DLIF to chromatographic homogeneity using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). DLIF concentrations in tissue extracts from rats measured as follows: adrenal glands, 44.3; serum, 6.3; liver, 5.2; kidney, 1.2; heart, brain, or lungs, less than 1.4 ng of digoxin-equivalent per g of protein. Human tissues showed similar results. In dogs, the ratio of the DLIF concentration in lumbar vein serum to that in infrarenal inferior vena cava serum was 3.3 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- S.E., n = 4). Bovine adrenal cortex contained 7 times more DLIF per g of tissue than the adrenal medulla. 70 +/- 4% (n = 7) of the total bovine cortical DLIF activity (6,159 pg of digoxin-equivalent) applied to a reverse phase HPLC column eluted as one definitive fraction. 60% of the digoxin-like immunoreactivity extracted from bovine serum also co-eluted with DLIF from adrenal. None of the 14 steroid molecules or 7 cardiac glycoside congeners co-eluted with the major DLIF activity. Our data indicate that 947 pmol of DLIF is equivalent to 1 pmol of digoxin-equivalent immunoreactivity. Preliminary mass spectral analysis suggests that purified DLIF has a molecular mass of 780 daltons comprised of one 390-dalton aglycone component plus several sugar moieties. This study establishes a definitive link between DLIF in serum and the adrenal cortex as a source tissue. We also demonstrate a method for purifying DLIF to chromatographic homogeneity with an extraction capacity of 1.2 nmol of DLIF per g of adrenal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1599914638,"Menaquinol-fumarate oxidoreductase of Escherichia coli is a four-subunit membrane-bound complex that catalyzes the final step in anaerobic respiration when fumarate is the terminal electron acceptor. The enzyme is structurally and catalytically similar to succinate dehydrogenase (succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) from both procaryotes and eucaryotes. Both enzymes have been proposed to contain an essential cysteine residue at the active site based on studies with thiol-specific reagents. Chemical modification studies have also suggested roles for essential histidine and arginine residues in catalysis by succinate dehydrogenase. In the present study, a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification techniques have been used to investigate the role(s) of the conserved histidine 232, cysteine 247, and arginine 248 residues of the flavorprotein subunit (FrdA) in active site function. A role for His-232 and Arg-248 of FrdA is shown by loss of both fumarate reductase and succino-oxidase activities following site-directed substitution of these particular amino acids. Evidence is also presented that suggests a second arginine residue may form part of the active site. Potential catalytic and substrate-binding roles for arginine are discussed. The effects of removing histidine-232 of FrdA are consistent with its proposed role as a general acid-base catalyst. The fact that succinate oxidation but not fumarate reduction was completely lost, however, might suggest that alternate proton donors substitute for His-232. The data confirm that cysteine 247 of FrdA is responsible for the N-ethylmaleimide sensitivity shown by fumarate reductase but is not required for catalytic activity or the tight-binding of oxalacetate, as previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W1515997534,"Brain type II 5'-iodothyronine deiodinase and liver type I 5'-iodothyronine deiodinase activities are decreased in rats fed a Se(2+)-deficient diet suggesting that both enzymes are Se(2+)-dependent proteins. Since serum thyroxine (T4) concentrations are twice normal in the Se(2+)-deficient animals, it is unclear whether the Se2+ deficiency or the increased circulating T4 account for the decrease in the brain enzyme. In order to separate these two possibilities, the effects of Se2+ on 5'-deiodinase in glial cells (type II) and LLC-PK1 cells (type I) were examined. LLC-PK1 and glial cells were grown in serum-free defined medium containing 0, 1 pM, 10 nM, and 40 nM Se2+ for 3-5 days or in medium containing 75Se2+ for 24 h. Deiodinase isozymes were determined by measuring catalytic activity and by quantification of the BrAc[125I]T4 affinity-labeled substrate binding subunits. Se2+ deficiency was confirmed by measuring the activity of the selenoprotein, glutathione peroxidase. Se2+ caused a concentration-dependent increase in glutathione peroxidase activity in both cell types, as well as in the type I enzyme, but had no effect on the type II enzyme. LLC-PK1 cells contained multiple 75Se(2+)-labeled proteins including the 27-kDa substrate binding subunit of the type I 5'-deiodinase. Glial cells contained seven 75Se(2+)-labeled proteins ranging in size from 12 to 62 kDa, none of which corresponded to the type II substrate binding subunit. these data show that, unlike the type I enzyme, the type II enzyme does not contain a selenocysteine or selenomethionine, further emphasizing the differences between these two isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1674155779,"Acyl turnover of rat hepatocyte phospholipids and triacylglycerols was assessed by incubating the cells in media containing 40% H2(18)O and measuring the time-dependent incorporation of 18O into ester carbonyls by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of hydrogenated methyl esters. Incorporation of 18O into 22-carbon acyl groups was low in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine, whereas in phosphatidylethanolamine, it was about the same as in the other acyl groups. Incorporation of 18O into individual molecular species of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine was determined after phospholipase C hydrolysis, derivatization to dinitrobenzoates, and separation by high-performance liquid chromatography. In most molecular species, acyl groups at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions became 18O-labeled at drastically different rates, indicating remodeling through deacylation-reacylation. Molecular species expected to arise de novo from acylation of glycerophosphate exhibited similar rates of 18O incorporation at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions. The data suggest that hepatocyte phospholipids are continually synthesized, remodeled by deacylation-reacylation at specific turnover rates up to 10-15%/h, and degraded. This acyl turnover probably does not involve the majority of intracellular unesterified fatty acids whose 18O incorporation was found to be very low. In contrast, the oxygens of extracellular unesterified fatty acids were readily exchanged with the media. This exchange was enzyme-catalyzed, possibly by lipases released into the media from damaged cells. Incorporation of 18O into exogenously added fatty acids was also rapid and resulted in enhanced uptake of 18O-labeled fatty acids into cellular lipids, primarily triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholine, without drastic change of the intracellular free fatty acid pool."
https://openalex.org/W1547552856,"Deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues, isomerization of aspartic acid side chains, and racemization of the L- to the D-form of the amino acids are common spontaneous chemical reactions known to occur in proteins. Previous studies have implicated succinimides as intermediates in these reactions; however, the evidence has been indirect. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of a succinimide intermediate in an intact protein. The succinimide (cyclic imide) variant was isolated from thermally stressed recombinant methionyl human growth hormone (hGH) by high performance anion-exchange chromatography, further purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and analyzed by tryptic mapping. A later eluting tryptic peptide, compared with the native T12 peptide (residues 128-134, Leu-Glu-Asp-Gly-Ser-Pro-Arg), was analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). This variant had a protonated molecular mass of 755.3 atomic mass units (u), as compared with 773.3 u for the native T12 peptide. A difference of 18 u, a loss of water, is consistent with the formation of a succinimide intermediate at Asp-130 of methionyl hGH. MS/MS analysis of the cyclic imide-containing peptide verified that the modification occurred at Asp-130. A difference of 18 u was also observed for the intact cyclic imide methionyl hGH variant (22,238 u), as measured by electrospray mass spectrometry, compared with native methionyl hGH (22,256 u)."
https://openalex.org/W1596577620,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 5 (eIF-5), isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysates, is a monomeric protein of 58-62 kDa. The function of eIF-5 in the formation of an 80 S polypeptide chain initiation complex from a 40 S initiation complex has been investigated. Incubation of the isolated 40 S initiation complex (40 S.AUG.Met.tRNAf.eIF-2 GTP) with eIF-5 resulted in the rapid and quantitative hydrolysis of GTP bound to the 40 S initiation complex. The rate of this reaction was unaffected by the presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits. Analysis of eIF-5-catalyzed reaction products by gel filtration indicated that both eIF-2.GDP binary complex and Pi formed were released from the ribosomal complex whereas Met-tRNAf remained bound to 40 S ribosomes as a Met-tRNAf.40 S.AUG complex. Reactions carried out with biologically active 32P-labeled eIF-5 indicated that this protein was not associated with the 40 S.AUG.Met-tRNAf complex; similar results were obtained by immunological methods using monospecific anti-eIF-5 antibodies. The isolated 40 S.AUG.Met-RNAf complex, free of eIF-2.GDP binary complex and eIF-5, readily interacted with 60 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of exogenously added eIF-5 to form the 80 S initiation complex capable of transferring Met-tRNAf into peptide linkages. These results indicate that the sole function of eIF-5 in the initiation of protein synthesis is to mediate hydrolysis of GTP bound to the 40 S initiation complex in the absence of 60 S ribosomal subunits. This leads to formation of the intermediate 40 S.AUG.Met-tRNAf and dissociation of the eIF-2.GDP binary complex. Subsequent joining of 60 S ribosomal subunits to the intermediate 40 S.AUG.Met-tRNAf complex does not require participation of eIF-5. Thus, the formation of an 80 S ribosomal polypeptide chain initiation complex from a 40 S ribosomal initiation complex can be summarized by the following sequence of partial reactions. (40 S.AUG.Met-tRNAf.eIF-2.GTP) eIF-5----(40 S.AUG.Met-tRNAf) + (eIF-2.GDP) + Pi (1) (40 S.AUG.Met-tRNAf) + 60 S----(80 S.AUG.Met-tRNAf) (2) 80 S initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1484138102,"The alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, L-asp(L-Asn)-beta-hydroxylase which posttranslationally hydroxylates specific aspartic acid (asparagine) residues within epidermal growth factor-like domains was purified from bovine liver and characterized. A 52-kDa and a 56-kDa species of this enzyme, which accounted for 60 and 30% of the total enzymatic activity, respectively, were purified to apparent homogeneity. Amino-terminal sequence analyses and immunoblots utilizing antisera raised to the intact 52-kDa species as well as to two complementary fragments of this species demonstrated that the 52- and 56-kDa species differ by a 22-amino acid amino-terminal extension. The remaining 10% of the purified enzymatic activity could be accounted for by the presence of immunologically related higher molecular mass forms (56-90 kDa) of L-Asp(L-Asn)-beta-hydroxylase. Strong evidence was obtained from the results of immunoextraction studies that L-Asp(L-Asn)-beta-hydroxylase can be identified with the purified proteins. Kinetic and physical studies suggest that L-Asp(L-Asn)-beta-hydroxylase exists as a monomer with a compact catalytic domain and an extended protease-sensitive amino terminus whose function remains to be determined. Since the purified L-Asp(L-Asn)-beta-hydroxylase hydroxylated both L-Asp- and L-Asn-containing substrates, it is possible that a single enzyme is responsible for the hydroxylation of Asp and Asn residues in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1630599135,"Movement of free fatty acids (FFA) across the plasma membrane has been directly measured for the first time, using fluorescent FFA analogs and quantitative fluorescence microscopy. The rate of short chain FFA (less than or equal to 12 carbons) transport from the extracellular medium into intracellular lipid droplets of 3T3F442A adipocytes was more than 40-fold faster than long chain FFA (16 and 18 carbons). The membrane-impermeable amino reagent 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, inhibited greater than or equal to 50% of the long chain FFA transport but had no effect on short chain FFA transport. Oleic acid (2 microM) inhibited 90% of the fluorescent oleate transport but had no effect on the 11-carbon analog. These results indicate that a large fraction of long chain FFA uptake is mediated by a plasma membrane protein (s)."
https://openalex.org/W1538728268,"The intracellular iron level exerts a negative feedback on transferrin receptor (TfR) expression in cells requiring iron for their proliferation, in contrast to the positive feedback observed in monocytes-macrophages. It has been suggested recently that modulation of TfR and ferritin synthesis by iron is mediated through a cytoplasmic protein(s) (iron regulatory element-binding protein(s) (IRE-BP)), which interacts with ferritin and TfR mRNA at the level of hairpin structures (IRE), thus leading to inhibition of transferrin mRNA degradation and repression of ferritin mRNA translation. In the present study we have evaluated in parallel the level of TfR expression, ferritin, and IRE-BP in cultures of: (i) circulating human lymphocytes stimulated to proliferate by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and (ii) circulating human monocytes maturing in vitro to macrophages. The cells were grown in either standard or iron-supplemented culture. TfR and ferritin expression was evaluated at both the protein and mRNA level. IRE-BP activity was measured by gel retardation assay in the absence or presence of beta-mercaptoethanol (spontaneous or total IRE-BP activity, respectively). Spontaneous IRE-BP activity, already present at low level in quiescent T lymphocytes, shows a gradual and marked increase in PHA-stimulated T cells from day 1 of culture onward. This increase is directly and strictly correlated with the initiation and gradual rise of TfR expression, which is in turn associated with a decrease of ferritin content. Both the rise of TfR and spontaneous IRE-BP activity are completely inhibited in iron-supplemented T cell cultures. In contrast, the total IRE-BP level is similar in both quiescent and PHA-stimulated lymphocytes, grown in cultures supplemented or not with iron salts. Monocytes maturing in vitro to macrophages show a sharp increase of spontaneous and, to a lesser extent, total IRE-BP; the addition of iron moderately stimulates the spontaneous IRE-BP activity but not the total one. Here again, the rise of spontaneous IRE-BP from very low to high activity is strictly related to the parallel increase of TfR expression and, suprisingly, also with a very pronounced rise of ferritin expression observed at both the mRNA and protein level. It is noteworthy the effect of beta-mercaptoethanol is cell specific, i.e. the ratio of total versus spontaneous IRE-BP activity is different in activated lymphocytes and maturing monocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1592024261,"Several synthetic DNAs were prepared containing the unusual bases 7-deazaadenine (c7A) and 7-deazaguanine (c7G). As judged from changes in melting temperatures these modified DNAs bound ethidium to a similar extent as the parent polymers. However, duplexes such as poly [d(Tc7G)].poly[d(CA)] and poly[d-(TC)].poly[d(c7GA]) gave no enhancement of ethidium fluorescence in a standard ethidium fluorescence assay. Fluorescence spectra in the range 400-650 nm showed that ethidium bound to poly[d(TC)].poly[d(Gc7A)] gave 70% of the fluorescence of the parent polymer poly[d(TC)].poly[d(GA)], whereas the fluorescence of poly[d(TC)].poly[d(c7GA)] was essentially 0%. Even the intrinsic fluorescence of ethidium in solution was quenched in the presence of poly[d(TC)].poly[d(c7GA)]. Binding constants were estimated from Scatchard analysis and were 4.8, 3.4, and 2.0 x 10(6) M-1 for poly[d(TC)].poly[d(GA)], poly[d(TC)].poly[d(Gc7A)], and poly[d(TC)].poly[d(c7GA)], respectively. This reduction in binding constant cannot account for the loss of fluorescence. The UV spectrum of ethidium was measured in the presence of these DNAs, and some significant differences were noted. Presumably the presence of 7-deazaguanine alters the electronic structure of bound ethidium so that it can no longer fluoresce."

For better definition of the relative roles of three light chain antigen contact residues (L27dhis, L32tyr and L34arg), four site-specific mutations (L27dhis to L27lys, L32tyr to L32phe, and L34arg to L34lys and L34his) were generated and expressed in single-chain antigen binding derivatives of monoclonal antibody 4-4-20 containing two different polypeptide linkers (SCA 4-4-20/205c, 25 amino acids and SCA 4-4-20/212, 14 amino acids). Results showed that L27dhis and L32tyr were necessary for wild type binding affinities, however, were not required for near-wild type Qmax values (where Qmax is the maximum fluoroscein fluorescence quenching expressed as percent). Tyrosine L32 which hydrogen bonds with ligand was also characterized at the haptenic level through the use of 9-hydroxyphenylfluoron which lacks the carboxyl group to which L32 tyrosine forms a hydrogen bond. Results demonstrated that wild type SCA and mutant L32phe possessed similar HPF binding characteristics. Active site contact residue L34arg was important for fluorescein quenching maxima and binding affinity (L34his mutant), however, substitution of lysine for arginine at L34 did not have a significant effect on observed Qmax value. In addition, substitutions had no effect on structural and topological characteristics, since all mutants retained similar idiotypic and metatypic properties. Finally, two linkers were comparatively examined to determine relative contributions to mutant binding properties and stability. No linker effects were observed. Collectively, these results verified the importance of these light chain fluorescein contact residues in the binding pocket of monoclonal antibody 4-4-20."
https://openalex.org/W1534736278,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) is sensitive to oxidative inactivation, and it has been suggested that specific oxidation of a methionine residue, Met347, situated in the P1' position of the reactive center may be the cause of the inactivation. To test this hypothesis we have purified and biochemically characterized mutant proteins of PAI-1 in which Met347 and either of two other methionines, Met266 or Met354, has been replaced with oxidation-resistant valine residues. The mutant proteins were found to be equally sensitive to oxidation as wild-type PAI-1, suggesting that a specific oxidation of the P1' Met347 is not responsible for the inactivation. When PAI-1 was oxidized, circular dichroism analysis revealed a rapid conformational change that correlated to the loss of inhibitory activity. The oxidation sensitivity of PAI-1 was enhanced dramatically in the presence of 0.001% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the circular dichroism spectrum was significantly different from that of untreated PAI-1, suggesting that the increased sensitivity to oxidation may be caused by a conformational change in the inhibitor molecule. Taken together, our data suggest that the oxidative inactivation of PAI-1 is not caused by the specific oxidation of the P1' methionine but results from a conformational change in the protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W1541138744,"Expression of lysosomal cysteine proteinases was studied during fetal calf myoblast-myotube differentiation. Activities of cathepsin B and L, but not cathepsin H, increase during bovine myogenic differentiation. In fetal muscle, cathepsin B and L activities are 2-4-fold orders of magnitude lower than in cultured myoblasts. Active-site titrations of cathepsin B with E-64 nevertheless reveal similar concentrations of active cathepsin B in myoblasts and myotubes, but 5-6-fold lower concentrations in fetal muscle. To specify whether concentrations of cathepsin B are related to levels of cathepsin B transcript, a cDNA clone encoding bovine cathepsin B was isolated and liquid hybridizations were performed with 32P-riboprobes complementary to the mRNA. In agreement with active-site titrations, there is no difference in cathepsin B mRNA levels between cultured myoblasts and myotubes, but lower levels of mRNA are found in fetal muscle. Concentrations of active cathepsin B therefore reflect levels of cathepsin B mRNA. Kinetic studies revealed that the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of cathepsin B is 2-3-fold higher in myotubes than in myoblasts. The increase in cathepsin B activity during calf myoblast-myotube differentiation is thus due to modifications of enzymatic properties, and not of enzyme concentrations. The different catalytic efficiency of cathepsin B in myotubes and myoblasts was related neither to modifications of mRNA size, as revealed by Northern blot analysis, nor to a different Mr of the active enzyme, as revealed by affinity labeling with benzyloxycarbonyl-Tyr(-125I)-Ala-CHN2, but to limited differences in cathepsin B isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1519184075,"The gene rpo35, encoding a subunit of the vaccinia virus DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, was identified, and its RNA and protein products were characterized. An Mr 35,000 polypeptide, which bound antibody to the purified RNA polymerase, was synthesized in reticulocyte lysates programmed with viral mRNA that hybridized to a 2,300-base pair segment of the viral genome. Determination of the sequence of the DNA segment revealed four potential protein coding regions, none of which had evident similarity to any described RNA polymerase subunit of prokaryotes or eukaryotes. One open reading frame that could encode a 35,400-Da protein was identified as rpo35 on the basis of mRNA hybridization, cell-free translation, and immunoprecipitation. The identification was confirmed by sequencing tryptic peptides of the authentic Mr 35,000 RNA polymerase subunit. Antiserum to the purified recombinant protein, expressed in bacteria, reacted specifically with a Mr 35,000 polypeptide that was detected starting 2 h after virus infection and that co-sedimented with RNA polymerase purified from virions. RNA analyses indicated that the 5'-end of an early transcript started 25 nucleotides upstream of rpo35, which is consistent with the location of an early promoter consensus sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1548864578,"Casein kinase II (CKII) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase with numerous key functions in cell metabolism and growth. The human CKII has a tetrameric structure; two catalytic subunits (alpha and alpha') form the holoenzyme together with two presumably regulatory subunits (beta). The gene encoding CKII subunit beta was isolated from human genomic DNA and analyzed for its primary structure using exclusively nonradioactive procedures. The gene was found to span 4.2 kilobase pairs and to be composed of seven exons. Exon sizes range from 76 (exon 5) to 329 base pairs (bp) (exon 1), intron sizes from 145 (intron V) to 965 bp (intron II). All exon-intron junctional sequences conform to the canonical GT-AG rule. Primer extension analysis determined three transcription initiation sites, at 951, 919, and (minor) 840 bp upstream of the translation start site. The translation start is located early in the second exon; exon 1 is untranslated. The 3'-cleavage/polyadenylation signal sequence (AA-TAAA) is in the last exon at position 4173 bp relative to the first transcription initiation site. The coding sequence for CKII beta comprises 648 nucleotides identical to the published CKII beta-cDNA sequence (Jakobi, R., Voss, H., and Pyerin, W. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 183, 227-233). The upstream promoter region of the CKII beta gene contains multiple potential gene regulatory sequence elements, noticeable DNA structures, and the characteristics of a housekeeping gene (more than one transcription initiation site, lack of a TATA-box, presence of a CpG island, occurrence of multiple GC boxes and of nonstandard positioned CCAAT boxes). The CKII beta gene promoter shares common features with that of mammalian protein kinases and is closely related to the regulatory subunit gene promoter of cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1587795336,"The fatty acid-acylated enzyme pullulanase is normally found in either of two locations in Escherichia coli, depending on whether or not the producing strains also express the genes specifically required for the second step in pullulanase secretion. When they are expressed, the enzyme is localized to the cell surface, while in their absence, it is directed to an unidentified location in the cell envelope which, upon lysis, forms vesicles whose density is intermediate between those of outer and cytoplasmic membrane vesicles. In order to test the role of the putative lipoprotein sorting signal, Asp2, in pullulanase sorting and secretion, the structural gene (pulA) was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Replacement of the Asp2 residue by Asn, Glu, or Ser caused the enzyme to fractionate with outer membrane-derived vesicles rather than with intermediate density vesicles from E. coli cells devoid of pullulanase secretion genes. A pronounced secretion defect was observed in a two-step secretion assay in which the first (sec gene-dependent) and second (pul gene-dependent) secretion steps were uncoupled. We propose that the Asp residue increases the efficiency of pullulanase secretion by allowing the enzyme to be initially sorted to a region of the cell envelope wherein most of the pullulase-specific secretion factors are located."
https://openalex.org/W1573418831,"Complementary DNA encoding human lysozyme was subjected to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. At one of three selected positions, amino acid residues 22, 68, or 118, the signal for N-linked glycosylation was created. The mutant DNAs were inserted into a eucaryotic vector and transfected into cultured hamster cells. The three mutant cDNAs directed synthesis of lysozyme mutants, which were named LI, LII, and LIII. The mutant lysozymes LI and LII comprised mixtures of glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms. The glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of mutant LI were found to have an enzymatic activity similar to normal human milk lysozyme. The usage of the glycosylation sites in the mutants was similar in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and baby hamster kidney cells. Approximately two of every three molecules in mutant LI, approximately one of every eight molecules in mutant LII, and practically no molecules in mutant LIII became glycosylated. In CHO cells, the processing of the oligosaccharide side chains yielded several larger products than in baby hamster kidney cells. This size variability of glycosylated lysozyme from CHO cells may be explained by the presence of biantennary and triantennary endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-resistant oligosaccharides with N-acetyllactosamine repeats of variable length and by the presence of hybrid oligosaccharides, as suggested by affinity to several lectins and sensitivity to endo-beta-galactosidase. In both cell types, the majority of the glycosylated forms were secreted and thus behaved similarly to nonglycosylated lysozyme. A small proportion of mutant LI lysozyme remained associated with the cells. The retained lysozyme was recruited predominantly from the molecules bearing high mannose oligosaccharides. These molecules were targeted to lysosomes, and their carbohydrate was trimmed to an endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-resistant form. Owing to the small size of mutant LI lysozyme, minor changes in the size of its carbohydrate moiety result in detectable changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the whole glycoprotein. We suggest that this novel glycoprotein could be used as a reporter in studies on processing and segregation of glycoproteins."

In the present study, we investigated the sites of interaction between the N-terminal regulatory domain of TnC and the inhibitory region (residues 96-116) of TnI, using a mutant rabbit skeletal TnC (designated as TnC57) that contains a single Cys at residue 57 in the C-helix. TnC57 was modified with the photoreactive cross-linker 4-maleimidobenzophenone (BP-Mal), and, after formation of a binary complex with TnI, cross-linking between the proteins was induced by photolysis. The resulting product was cleaved with CNBr and several proteases, and peptides containing cross-links were purified and subjected to amino acid sequencing. The results show that Cys-57 of TnC57 is cross-linked to the segment of TnI spanning residues 113-121. Previously, we showed that Cys-98 of TnC can be cross-linked via BP-Mal to TnI residues 103-110 (Leszyk, J., Collins, J.H., Leavis, P.C., and Tao, T. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 7042-7047). Taken together, these results demonstrate that both the C- and the N-terminal domains of TnC interact with the inhibitory region of TnI and are consistent with the hypothesis that, in a complex with TnI, TnC adopts a more compact conformation than in the crystal structure."

Both proteins have been purified from E. coli HMS83 cells based on their requirement for the reconstitution of bacteriophage phi X174 complementary strand DNA synthesis in vitro with purified proteins. As a step toward understanding the role of these proteins in vivo, the genes for primosomal proteins and n, designated priB and priC, respectively, have been cloned molecularly. priB encodes a 104-amino acid 11.4-kDa polypeptide and corresponds to an previously identified open reading frame between rpsF and rps R within a ribosomal protein operon at 95.5 min on the E. coli chromosome. priC encodes a 175-amino acid 20.3-kDa polypeptide. These two gene products were overexpressed at least 1000-fold in E. coli using a bacteriophage T7 transient expression system. Both proteins have been purified to apparent homogeneity from extracts prepared from these overproducing strains."

This characteristic makes prepro-alpha-factor potentially useful as a probe in the biochemical dissection of the mechanism of this basic cellular process. Efforts have been limited by the inability to isolate sufficient quantities of such secretory protein precursors in a translocation-competent form. We report here the one-step purification of chemical amounts of translocation-competent prepro-alpha-factor using nickel ion affinity chromatography on nitrilotriacetate resin. An oligonucleotide encoding 6 histidine residues was inserted into a genomic clone encoding prepro-alpha-factor 5' of the naturally occurring translational stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis. The construct was expressed at high levels in a SecY- strain of Escherichia coli. The produced preprotein was solubilized in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and bound to nitrilotriacetate resin. Prepro-alpha-factor was recovered at a purity in excess of 95% by elution with 0.25 M imidazole, 8 M urea, which competitively displaced the histidine affinity tag from the nickel column. The chemical amounts of prepro-alpha-factor obtained in this way were determined to be competent for translocation across yeast microsomal membranes and for subsequent modifications such as signal sequence cleavage and N-linked glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1498955319,"A DNA fragment of about 3.4 kilobase pairs that expressed the HgaI modification activity was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of Haemophilus gallinarum, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Two open reading frames (ORF) which could code for structurally similar proteins were identified in the upstream and middle regions and a truncated ORF in the downstream region in the same orientation. When the respective ORFs were separately cloned, the clones carrying the upstream and middle ORFs both expressed the modification activity, indicating that the two genes are involved in modification of the HgaI restriction-modification system. In order to determine the sites of modification precisely, the respective genes were recloned into an expression vector, from which gene products were purified. A short DNA fragment carrying the HgaI recognition site was treated with each of these enzymes, and, after separation of the two strands by duplex formation with M13 viral DNAs carrying the respective strands, the presence or absence of modification was judged from susceptibility to HgaI endonuclease. The results of analysis showed that different strands were modified in an asymmetric way by each gene product. Analysis of the species and positions of modified bases by the Maxam-Gilbert method further demonstrated that the gene products from the upstream and middle ORFs participated in methylation of the internal cytosine residues of the strands carrying 3'-CTGCG-5' and 5'-GACGC-3', respectively. We concluded that the HgaI modification system consisted of two cytosine methylase genes responsible for modification of different strands in the target DNA."

Competition binding experiments showed that both of the ATP-alpha-S sites were accessible to ADP and vice versa. [35S]ATP-alpha-S was photoaffinity cross-linked to unfixed platelets by direct irradiation with ultraviolet light. A single radiolabeled component (120 kDa) was identified and shown to be identical with the alpha subunit of GPIIb based on two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with anti-GPIIb monoclonal antibodies, by isoelectric focusing (pI 4.5-5.5), by immunoaffinity adsorption using monoclonal anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies coupled to Sepharose, and by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Amino-terminal sequencing of a tryptic fragment labeled with [35S]ATP-alpha-S identified an 18-kDa domain beginning at Tyr-198 in the primary sequence of GPIIb alpha.

https://openalex.org/W1485823504,"Abstract Analysis of the Sephacryl S-200 fractionated type IV collagen domains from bovine and human glomerular basement membranes (GBM) and calf anterior lens capsule (ALC) indicated that Asn-linked oligosaccharides are primarily or exclusively localized in the 7 S region, whereas the hydroxylysine-linked Glc alpha 1----2Gal disaccharides (Glc-Gal-Hyl) are present in all the major segments of the molecule (7 S, NC1, and helical domain); no Ser/Thr-linked saccharide were detected. The Asn-linked carbohydrate units observed in the 7 S domain (Mr approximately 300,000) occurred in a number equal to the 12 polypeptide chains constituting this cross-linked region, and this was consistent with lectin blots of the reduced electrophoretically resolved 7 S components. Fractionation of the N-glycanase and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase-released oligosaccharides by concanavalin A affinity and high performance liquid chromatography indicated that the Asn-linked carbohydrate occurred predominantly in the form of complex tri- and biantennary units, although submolar amounts of polymannose variants (Man5-7GlcNAc2) were also present in calf ALC and bovine GBM. Structural studies of the complex N-linked oligosaccharides employing hydrazine/nitrous acid fragmentation and glycosidase digestions indicated a pattern in which there was complete fucosylation of the innermost GlcNAc residue of the Man3GlcNAc2 core but only sparse substitution with capping groups of the nonrepeating N-acetyllactosamine branches. Whether tri- or biantennary, the oligosaccharides from bovine GBM contained only one capping residue, in the form of either NeuAc or alpha-D-Gal, whereas those from ALC had only a single alpha-D-Gal and no NeuAc; human GBM oligosaccharides were devoid of both NeuAc and alpha-D-Gal. The absence of terminal alpha-D-Gal in the human 7 S domain was reflected in its lack of reactivity with Bandeiraea simplicifolia I and from its failure to yield Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4 [3H]anhydromannitol after hydrazine/nitrous acid/NaB3H4 treatment. Application of the latter procedure to the collagen domains yielded, in addition to fragments from the N-linked oligosaccharides, a disaccharide (Glc alpha 1----2[3H]galactitol) derived from the Glc-Gal-Hyl units. The localization of Asn-linked carbohydrate units in the evolutionarily conserved 7S domain of type IV collagens suggests that these oligosaccharides may play a role in the assembly of the collagen network of basement membranes."

Brain cDNA BRT-1 is 2.2 kilobases in length and encodes 283 amino acids. It is identical to skeletal muscle beta-tropomyosin from amino acids 1 to 258. The sequence 3' of this point is unique to BRT-1; a comparison to genomic sequence indicates that a new carboxyl-terminal exon is used to generate this sequence. 1.4-kilobase brain cDNA BRT-2 contains sequences found in both fibroblast cDNA FT-beta (5'-end) and skeletal muscle cDNA SKT-beta (3'-end). RNase and S1 nuclease assays using RNA samples from leg muscle, gizzard, fibroblasts, and brain indicate that the TM 1 gene expresses four additional tropomyosin RNAs by alternately splicing previously characterized exons. These results demonstrate that the chicken TM 1 gene encodes nine tropomyosin RNAs through the use of two promoters, two internal exons that are mutually exclusive, and three 3'-exons. Implications for the regulation of alternative splicing are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1598614839,"Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) messenger RNA levels, biosynthesis, processing, and secretion were studied in cultured mouse beta TC3 insulinoma cells. Northern blot analysis revealed that the size of IAPP mRNA (0.9 kb) in beta TC3 cells was the same as that in normal mouse islets; IAPP mRNA was approximately 60% of the level of insulin mRNA in beta TC3 cells. However, the ratio of synthesis of insulin to IAPP was approximately 6:1, suggesting that IAPP mRNA is not translated efficiently in these cells. Metabolic labeling of beta TC3 cells with [3H]leucine revealed the synthesis of both a precursor form of IAPP (pro-IAPP) of apparent Mr 7400 and a mature form (IAPP) of apparent Mr 3900. In pulse-chase experiments, pro-IAPP could be shown to be processed to IAPP in a manner similar to proinsulin. The t1/2 for conversion of pro-IAPP to IAPP was about 25 min, faster than the t1/2 for proinsulin to insulin of 70 min. A significant proportion of newly synthesized IAPP and insulin precursors were secreted via a constitutive pathway from beta TC3 cells. Possible effects of dexamethasone and forskolin on IAPP mRNA levels and biosynthesis were examined but no effects were observed. In conclusion, the IAPP gene is strongly expressed in beta TC3 cells leading to the biosynthesis, proteolytic processing, and secretion of IAPP, a putative islet hormone."

For detailed biochemical and pharmacological studies, a recombinant version of TAP (rTAP) has been produced in yeast. To determine the arrangement of the disulfide bonds, rTAP was cleaved with trypsin and chymotrypsin and the purified peptides sequenced using a gas-phase sequenator. The positions of the disulfide bonds were assigned by identifying the cycle(s) at which di-phenylthiohydan-toin-cystine was released. The specific disulfide bridges, Cys-5 to Cys-59, Cys-15 to Cys-39, and Cys-33 to Cys-55, are analogous to those in the prototype Kunitz-type inhibitor, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). While treatment of BPTI with dithiothreitol rapidly and specifically reduced one disulfide bond, the reduction of disulfide bonds in rTAP proceeded at a slower rate and appeared to be nonspecific, reaching a maximum of two disulfides reduced. Reduced rTAP derivatized with either iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide lost 59% of its inhibitory activity. In contrast, BPTI alkylated with iodoacetic acid inhibited trypsin half as well as the iodoacetamide derivative. Although the arrangement of disulfides in the two inhibitors is the same, their susceptibility to reduction is markedly different."

P. M., Quinones, S., and Hudson, B. G. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 13374-13380). In the present study, this chain was excised in the form of a truncated promoter by cleavage of basement membrane with Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase and characterized. The triple helical structure and NC1 domain were retained. Elastase selectively cleaved at a site within the triple helical domain of the alpha 3 chain that is distinct from the cleavage site of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains. The truncated alpha 3 chain was found to contain 1460 residues, of which 1225 comprise the collagenous domain, and is cross-linked within this domain by disulfide bonds, forming a high Mr complex (greater than 300,000). Truncated protomers with a length of 340 nm corresponding to the theoretical length for the truncated alpha 3 chain were observed by electron microscopy as suprastructures in which the triple helical domains of three protomers were interwined. These protomers were also connected to each other and to the 140-nm protomers that appear to be comprised of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains. These results extended the known length of the alpha 3 chain by about 1000 residues and suggested that protomers of this chain self-associate through interactions between their triple helical domains and between their NC1 domains."

In a subsequent slow reaction, accumulated maltose becomes acetylated and leaks back into the medium. The enzyme responsible for this acetylation uses acetyl-CoA as acetyl donor and can be measured in crude extracts (Boos, W., Ferenci, T., and Shuman, H. A. (1981) J. Bacteriol. 146, 725-732). The structural gene for the enzyme, which we named mac, was mapped at 10.4 min on the Escherichia coli linkage map. We cloned a 3.4-kilobase pair PstI-EcoRI DNA fragment containing the mac gene. Cell-free extracts of a strain harboring the multicopy plasmid were used to purify the maltose-transacetylating activity to apparent homogeneity. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels the enzyme exhibited a molecular weight of 20,000. Using molecular sieve chromatography, a molecular weight of 40,000 was determined for the native enzyme. Therefore, the enzyme is a dimer of two identical subunits. At a sugar concentration of 100 mM the enzyme acetylates glucose, maltose, mannose, galactose, and fructose in decreasing relative rate of 1, 0.55, 0.20, 0.07, 0.04. Maltotriose and other oligosaccharides were acetylated with 2% of the rate determined for glucose.

However, isolation of these enzymes has been difficult, due to the inability to distinguish authentic maturation enzyme from the many other trypsin-like activities present in tissue homogenates. Recently, a of the insulin cell endoprotease(s) was defined in vivo by assessing the processing of a series of mutant cleavage sites in a model prohormone, mouse POMC (mPOMC) (Thorne, B. A., and Thomas, G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8436-8443. To investigate mechanisms of tissue-specific processing, we sought to identify the endoprotease signature of a cell having a processing phenotype distinct from insulinoma cells. In this report, the cleavage site specificity of the endoprotease(s) expressed in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells is examined. High levels of mPOMC (1.6 pmol/10(6) cells) were expressed in these cells using a vaccinia virus vector, and the precursor was targeted to the regulated secretory pathway. Analysis of POMC-derived peptides revealed that chromaffin cells processed the prohormone to a set of peptides highly similar to anterior pituitary corticotrophs, including adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and beta-lipotropin, gamma-lipotropin, and beta-endorphin. This processing contrasted with the pattern of cleavage site utilization in Rin m5F insulinoma cells, which more closely resembled that of the intermediate pituitary melanotrophs. However, the processing preference for the sequences of pairs of basic amino acids (as tested using the entire series of mutant cleavage sites; -LysArg- (native), -ArgArg-, -ArgLys-, -LysLys-, -HisArg-, -MetArg- at the ACTH/beta-lipotropin junction and -LysLys- (native), -LysArg-, -ArgArg-, -ArgLys- in beta-endorphin) was the same in both insulinoma and adrenal chromaffin cells, suggesting recognition and cleavage by similar enzymes in both cell types. The cell-specific processing of mPOMC may thus result from expression of a common core set of processing enzymes and factors unique to each cell type affecting the enzyme accessibility to precursor cleavage sites."
https://openalex.org/W1564136863,"The chloroplast genome of chromophytic and rhodophytic algae differs from the plastid genome of plants and green algae in that it encodes the gene for the small subunit (rbcS) of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Hybridization studies indicated that there was a second region of chloroplast DNA from the marine diatom Cylindrotheca sp. strain N1 that strongly hybridized to a previously isolated Cylindrotheca fragment that contained the rbcS gene and flanking sequences. Subsequent determination of the oligonucleotide sequence of this second chloroplast DNA fragment, however, indicated that hybridization was due to identical sequences 3' to the previously cloned Cylindrotheca chloroplast rbcL rbcS genes. Sequences derived from the 5' end of the second chloroplast DNA fragment contained a short open reading frame of 80 amino acids which was found to be highly homologous to bacterial acyl carrier protein and nuclear-encoded acyl carrier protein from plants. Amino acid residues in the environment of Ser-36 of the Escherichia coli protein, which is bound to a 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety, are virtually identical in the Cylindrotheca deduced sequence and all other sources of this protein. Unlike plant acyl carrier-deduced amino acid sequences, there was no leader peptide sequence found for the presumptive Cylindrotheca protein, consistent with the location of this DNA fragment on the chloroplast genome of this organism. DNA encoding the putative acyl carrier protein gene and rbcS thus represent two genes that are chloroplast-encoded in the chromophytic marine diatom Cylindrotheca, a significant departure from the organization of such genes in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1496513334,"Activation of vitamin K-dependent plasma proteases occurs by specific interaction with components of the blood coagulation cascade. In this report, we describe the direct expression and enzymatic characterization of the human coagulation zymogen factor X and its activated form, factor Xa, from transformed Chinese hamster ovary fibroblast cell lines. Expression was achieved using either a full-length factor X cDNA or a unique mutant factor Xa cDNA. The functional factor Xa precursor contained a novel tripeptide bridge in place of the native 52-amino acid activation peptide. This mutation allowed for intracellular processing and secretion of the activated form of factor X. Secreted recombinant factors X (rX) and Xa (rXa) were purified by sequential anion-exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography. The enzymatic activities of factors rX and rXa were compared with those of plasma factors X and Xa in three independent assay systems. In comparison to human plasma factor X, the amidolytic, prothrombinase complex, and plasma clotting activities of factor rX were 50, 85, and 43%, respectively. The corresponding comparative activities for factor rXa were 32, 64, and 48%, respectively. The ability to directly express mutant forms of biologically active human factor X will facilitate the structure/function analysis of this important blood coagulation protein and may lead to the development of novel coagulation inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1602836733,"Time-dependent regulation of loop diuretic-sensitive Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport and [3H]bumetanide binding was investigated in cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells. Angiotensin II or epidermal growth factor induced stimulation of Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport within 5 min, with a return to the control values by 30 min. Treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (0.1 microM) (PMA), the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 microM), or the combination of 5 mM NaF and 10 microM AlCl3 produced a transient stimulation of Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport in 5-10 min to 148, 135, and 163% of control, respectively, which was followed by a progressive decrease to 34, 64, and 20% of the base-line activity, respectively, by 60 min. Exposure to cyclic 8-bromo-AMP (0.1 mM) or to forskolin (1 microM) and isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 mM) caused a maximal inhibition of the cotransport in 5 min to 79 and 60% of control, respectively, with a subsequent gradual increase to 137 and 164% of the base-line activity, respectively, by 60 min. The effects of PMA, forskolin, and cyclic 8-bromo-AMP were concentration-dependent. In order to characterize further the alterations in the cotransport activity, binding of [3H]bumetanide was determined. Saturation binding analyses showed that the late inhibition of the cotransport by PMA and stimulation by forskolin were associated with a significant decrease and increase, respectively, in Bmax, with no significant changes in binding affinity. Correlations between changes in the cotransport activity and [3H]bumetanide binding were also observed in cells treated with cyclic 8-bromo-AMP or with NaF and AlCl3. Incubation of cells in Cl- or Na+ free solution greater than or equal to 60 min resulted in an increase in both the cotransport activity and [3H]bumetanide binding. These observations indicate that, in glomerular mesangial cells, persistent stimulation of second messengers that regulate the cotransporter induces a time-dependent, biphasic regulation of Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport and that the regulation occurring after greater than or equal to 60 min of treatment is primarily due to changes in the number of the active cotransport sites. Because long term removal of the transported ions also increases the number of active cotransport sites, these results suggest that alterations in intracellular ionic homeostasis may also mediate cotransport activity."
https://openalex.org/W1589292152,"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct three mutant derivatives of the extracellular, cell surface lipoprotein pullulanase (PulA) in which the normally fatty acylated cysteine of the signal peptide-bearing precursor was replaced by other amino acids. When produced in Escherichia coli expressing all genes required for pullulanase secretion, approximately 90% of the PulA derivatives persisted as cell-associated precursors, indicating inefficient signal peptide processing. Processed (intermediate-sized) forms of the two derivatives that were studied in detail were found to result from proteolytic cleavage at different sites within the signal peptide. Both were further processed to smaller polypeptides by cleavage at an undetermined site that is presumably close to their C termini. The intermediate-sized pullulanase derived from prepullulanase in which Cys+1 had been replaced by Leu and Gly-1 by Glu (PulA:C1L/G-1E) appeared rapidly, was apparently entirely extracellular, and accounted for approximately 10% of synthesized PulA. Prolonged incubation did not result in further conversion of the precursor to the intermediate form, and the precursor remained anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane. The smaller processed form was also found extracellularly. The active form of the extracellular enzyme was monomeric, which is again in contrast to the fatty acylated, wild-type enzyme. Taken together, these results indicate that replacement of Cys+1 of prePulA eliminates processing by lipoprotein signal peptidase and does not permit processing by leader peptidase, but allows inefficient, aberrant processing by an unknown peptidase and immediate secretion of the resulting polypeptide, which retains most of its signal peptide. Processing and secretion only occur when the pullulanase secretion functions are expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1483969681,"Because myristic acid (14:0) is important in regulating cell function, we have studied its utilization in BC3H1 muscle cells. Phosphatidylcholine contained 70-80% of the [9,10-3H]14:0 radioactivity incorporated into the cell phospholipids. In both myoblasts and myocytes, however, large amounts of radioactivity also accumulated in a labile neutral lipid pool consisting mostly of triacylglycerol. Therefore, radioactive lipid products formed when BC3H1 cells labeled with 14:0 are stimulated are not necessarily derived only from phosphatidylcholine. Elongation of [9,10-3H]14:0 occurred rapidly in the myoblasts and myocytes, and extensive desaturation also occurred in the myoblasts. Thus, even after short periods of labeling, substantial amounts of radioactivity are contained in fatty acids other than 14:0. The labeling of proteins with [9,10-3H]myristic acid was generally similar in the myoblasts and myocytes. A number of lipid-soluble, polar radioactive metabolites were released into the medium during incubation of [9,10-3H]14:0 with the cells. [1-14C] 14:0 was not converted to these compounds, indicating that they are chain-shortened 14:0 derivatives. Based on chemical analysis, two of the major products appear to be hydroxylated fatty acids. This oxidation process shows some specificity for 14:0 because similar compounds were not produced from palmitic, oleic, or linoleic acids. The myocytes formed larger amounts of the metabolites than the myoblasts, suggesting that differentiation may increase the activity of this 14:0 oxidative pathway."
