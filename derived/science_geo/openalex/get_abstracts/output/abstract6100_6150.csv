https://openalex.org/W2111900996,"Dispersed repetitive DNA sequences from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) nuclear DNA have been isolated as molecular hybrids in lambdagt. Related S. cerevisiae strains show marked alterations in the size of the restriction fragments containing these repetitive DNAs. ""Ty1"" is one such family of repeated sequences in yeast and consists of a 5.6 kilobase (kb) sequence including a noninverted 0.25 kb sequence of another repetitious family, ""delta"", on each end. There are about 35 copies of Ty1 and at least 100 copies of delta (not always associated with Ty1) in the haploid genome. A few Ty1 elements are tandem and/or circular, but most are disperse and show (along with delta) some sequence divergence between repeat units. Sequence alterations involving Ty1 elements have been found during the continual propagation of a single yeast clone over the course of a month. One region with a large number of delta sequences (SUP4) also shows a high frequency of sequence alterations when different strains are compared. One of the differences between two such strains involves the presence or absence of a Ty1 element. The novel joint is at one inverted pair of delta sequences."

https://openalex.org/W2082072773,"The nucleotide sequence of a DNA complementary to human growth hormone messenger RNA was cloned; it contains 29 nucleotides in its 5' untranslated region, the 651 nucleotides coding for the prehormone, and the entire 3' untranslated region (108 nucleotides). The data reported predict the previously unknown sequence of the signal peptide of human growth hormone and, by comparison with the previously determined sequences of rat growth hormone and human chorionic somatomammotropin, strengthens the hypothesis that these genes evolved by gene duplication from a common ancestral sequence. The human growth hormone gene sequences have been linked in phase to a fragment of the trp D gene of Escherichia coli in a plasmid vehicle, and a fusion protein is synthesized at high level (approximately 3 percent of bacterial protein) under the control of the regulatory region of the trp operon. This fusion protein (70 percent of whose amino acids are coded for by the human growth hormone gene) reacts specifically with antibodies to human growth hormone and is stable in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2123824838,"Multiple nitrocellulose DNA filter replicas of plaques of in vitro generated recombinants of phage lambda and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been screened by hybridization with 32P-labeled cDNA probes. These probes were representative of total poly(A)-containing RNA of yeast cells grown on acetate, galactose, glucose or maltose. This approach allows the use of specific differences in total RNA populations as probes for gene isolation. Five ""galactose-induced"" clones have been isolated. Expression of the RNA coding regions on at least two cloned sequences, Sc481 and Sc482, is regulated by genes known to control the expression of the structural genes required for the conversion of exogenous galactose to endogenous glucose-1-phosphate. One cloned sequence, Sc484, is expressed during growth on all carbon sources except glucose, and is not under control by the galactose regulatory genes. This clone contains a sequence that is repeated 3 times in the yeast genome. The cloned fragment Sc481 contains coding regions for all or part of three galactose""induced RNAs and may correspond to the GAL 1, GAL 7, GAL 10 gene cluster region of chromosome II."
https://openalex.org/W2044977073,"Experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that the initial attachment and spreading of human fibroblasts in serum-free medium occurs to cell fibronectin which has been secreted and adsorbed on the substratum surface. Human skin fibroblasts attached and spread on tissue culture substrata in serum-free medium in 60 min. When potential protein adsorption sites on the substratum were covered with bovine serum albumin before initial human fibroblast attachment, their subsequent attachment to the substratum was prevented. When substratum adsorption sites were covered immediately after initial attachment, subsequent cell spreading was prevented. The distribution of fibronectin on human fibroblast surfaces during initial attachment and spreading was studied by indirect immunofluorescence analysis using a monospecific anti-cold-insoluble globulin antiserum. The initial appearance (10 min) of fibronectin was in spots over the entire cell surface. Concomitant with human fibroblast spreading, the random distribution of sites disappeared, and most fibronectin was subsequently observed in spots at the cell substratum interface (60 min). A fibrillar pattern of fibronectin appeared later (2–8 hr). The sites beneath the cells could be visualized as footprints on the substratum following treatment of the attached human fibroblasts with 0.1 M NaOH. A second fluorescence pattern of fibronectin secreted on the substratum was characterized by a diffuse halo around the cells and a very faint, diffuse staining elsewhere on the substratum. Another cell type (baby hamster kidney cells) was used to assay biologically for the presence or absence of the factor secreted by human fibroblasts on the substratum. Human fibroblasts were found to secrete an adhesion factor for baby hamster kidney cells onto the substratum in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion, and immunological studies indicated that the factor secreted by human fibroblasts was cross-reactive with cold-insoluble globulin, the plasma form of fibronectin. The conditioning factor secreted by the human fibroblasts was also found to be an attachment and spreading factor for human fibroblasts in experiments measuring human fibroblast adhesion to fibronectin footprints of human fibroblasts. Substratum-adsorbed cold-insoluble globulin was also found to be an attachment and spreading factor for human fibroblasts. Based upon the timing of appearance of conditioning factors on the substratum and the immunofluorescence patterns, it seems that the diffusely organized fibronectin on the substratum constitutes the sites to which cell attachment occurs. The bright spots of fibronectin that appear beneath the cells may represent fibronectin reorganization during cell spreading."

Permeability is limited by probe size and electronegativity, these two factors apparently being related reciprocally. In respect to both factors, mammalian junctional channels are more restrictive than insect channels; hence the mammalian channels are narrower, more polar, or both. The channels of the various mammalian cell types differed slightly from each other; in some types the serum of the culture medium affected the channel permeability."

https://openalex.org/W2103932192,"E. coli DNA gyrase, which catalyzes the supercoiling of DNA, cleaves DNA site-specifically when oxolinic acid and sodium dodecylsulfate are added to the reaction. We studied the structure of the gyrasecleaved DNA because of its implications for the reaction mechanism and biological role of gyrase. Gyrase made a staggered cut, creating DNA termini with a free 3' hydroxyl and a 5' extension that provided a template primer for DNA polymerase. The cleaved DNA was resistant to labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase even after treatment with proteinase K. Thus the denatured enzyme that remains attached to cleaved DNA is covalently bonded to both 5' terminal extensions. The 5' extensions of many gyrase cleavage fragments from phi X174, SV40 and Col E1 DNA were partially sequenced using repair with E. coli DNA polymerase I. No unique sequence existed within the cohesive ends, but G was the predominant first base incorporated by DNA polymerase I. The cohesive and sequences of four gyrase sites were determined, and they demonstrated a four base 5' extension. The dinucleotide TG, straddling the gyrase cut on one DNA strand, provided the only common bases within a 100 bp region surrounding the cleavage sites. Analysis of other cleavage fragments showed that cutting between a TG doublet is common to most, or all, gyrase cleavages. Other bases common to some of the sequenced sites were clustered nonrandomly around the TG doublet, and may be variable components of the cleavage sequence. This diverse recognition sequence with common elements is a pattern shared with several other specific nucleic acid-protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2073026653,"Absolute amounts of cadmium (in milligrams) in the left kidney and concentrations of cadmium (micrograms per gram) in the liver were measured in vivo in 20 healthy adult male volunteers. Organ cadmium levels of smokers were significantly elevated above those of nonsmokers. No relationship was evident between body stores of cadmium (liver and kidney) and cadmium or beta 2-microglobulin in urine or blood. The average total body burden of cadmium in man at age 50 is estimated to be 19.3 milligrams for nonsmokers and 35.5 milligrams for smokers (38.7 pack-year smoking history). Biological half-time for the whole body was, on average, 15.7 years (10- to 33-year range). Dietary absorption was 2.7 micrograms per day. Cigarette smoking resulted in the absorption of 1.9 micrograms per pack."
https://openalex.org/W2003949273,"Abstract This paper demonstrates that revertants of temperature-sensitive ben A (β-tubulin) mutations in Aspergillus nidulans can be used to identify proteins which interact with β-tubulin. Three benomyl-resistant ben A (β-tubulin) mutants of Aspergillus nidulans, BEN 9, BEN 15 and BEN 19, were found to be temperature-sensitive (ts − ) for growth. Temperature sensitivity co-segregated with benomyl resistance among the progeny of outcrosses of BEN 9, 15 and 19 to a wild-type strain, FGSC#99, indicating that temperature sensitivity was caused by mutations in the ben A gene in these strains. Eighteen revertants to ts + were isolated by selection at the restrictive temperature. Four had back-mutations in the ben A gene and fourteen carried extragenic suppressor mutations. Two of the back-mutated strains had β-tubulins which differed from the β-tubulins of their parental strains by one (1 − ) or two (2 − ) negative charges on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Although the β-tubulins of the extragenic suppressor strains were all electrophoretically identical to those of the parental strains, one of the suppressor strains, BEN 9R7, had an electrophoretic abnormality in α1-tubulin (1 + ). A heterozygous diploid between this strain and a strain with wild-type α1-tubulin was found to have both wild-type and mutant (1 + ) α1-tubulins. This experiment rules out post-translational modification as a possible cause of the α1-tubulin abnormality. Thus the suppressor mutation in BEN 9R7 must be in a structural gene for α1-tubulin. We propose that this gene be designated tub A to denote that it is a gene for α1-tubulin in A. nidulans."
https://openalex.org/W1973119481,"The nucleotide sequences have been determined for the promoter regions of two ribosomal RNA operons, rrnA and rrnE, in E. coli. The sequences cover the two in vitro transcription start sites identified for each operon (Gilbert, der Boer and Nomura, 1979). The first two start sites are 283 and 291 bp preceding the mature 16S rRNA (m16S rNA) coding regions for rrnE and rrnA, respectively; the second start sites are 174 and 174 +/- 1 bp preceding the m16S rRNA coding regions for rrnE and rrnA, respectively. Each of these start sites has an identifiable ""Pribnow box"" sequence 6-7 bp upstream from the start site. The nucleotide sequences of the two operons have nearly complete homology from the m16S rRNA coding regions to positions 145 bp upstream from those regions, and at the regions surrounding the Pribnow boxes preceding the first start sites. The DNA sequences indicate that the RNAs transcribed from the first start sites of rrnE and rrnA are quite different in their first 150 nucleotides. These heterogeneous regions, however, precede the RNAse III cleavage sites (deduced previously by Young and Steitz, 1978), and the ""precursor 16S rRNA"" molecules are largely homogeneous. The nucleotide sequences of the promoter regions of the two rRNA operons are also compared with those or rrnD and rrnX, determined by Young and Steitz (1979), and some common features are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1608195340,"A procedure has been developed which allows the T4 bacteriophage proteins corresponding to the products of genes 43, 44, 45, and 62 to be purified to near homogeneity from a single T4-infected cell lysate (greater than 90% single species as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide elctrophoresis). In these preparations, the major problem of removing all contaminating nucleases has been overcome. Each of the above proteins is known from genetic analysis to be essential for phage DNA replication. The protein product of gene 43 is T4 DNA polymerase, and its recovery can be monitored using a standard DNA assay. The other three gene products have been designated as polymerase accessory proteins, since they directly enhance function on both single- and double-stranded DNA templates. Their activities were monitored by an vitro complementation assay, which measures the stimulation of DNA synthesis observed in a concentrated lysate of T4 mutant-infected Escherichia coli cells when the missing T4 wild type protein is added. Starting from 300 g of infected cell paste, we obtained 9.3 mg of gene 43 protein, 21 mg of gene 45 protein, and 70 mg of a tight complex made up of 44 and 62 proteins; final yields were estimated at 30%, 14%, and 28%, respectively, of the initial activity present in the lysate. When the above purified proteins are incubated with preparations of two other T4 DNA replication proteins (gene 41 and gene 32 proteins) plus deoxyribonucleoside and ribonucleoside triphosphates, extensive DNA synthesis occurs on both single- and double-stranded DNA templates. As reported elsewhere, this synthesis mimicks that catalyzed by the T4 DNA replication apparatus in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2019883278,"We have identified two major and approximately ten minor poly(A)-containing RNA species in S. cerevisiae which arise from in vivo transcription of the yeast plasmid, known as 2μ circle. The two major species, which are 1325 and 1275 bases in length, are transcribed from the two unique halves of the plasmid and extend into the inverted repeat sequences which separate the unique regions. The map positions of the minor transcripts, which range in length from 350 to 2600 bases, indicate that except for a small region of the genome in which no transcription is observed, both strands of the entire 2μ circle genome are transcribed. We also present evidence demonstrating that RNA transcribed from 2μ circular DNA is used to program the synthesis of specific proteins in yeast: that is, yeast RNA complementary to 2μ circle DNA can be translated in vitro to produce specific polypeptides of substantial size. Finally, the pattern of transcription of 2μ circle suggests the possibility that messenger RNA species are derived by cleavage of larger transcripts, and in addition, that the intramolecular recombination of 2μ circle which occurs in yeast functions as a genetic switch to allow separate expression of two sets of genes on the 2μ circle genome."
https://openalex.org/W2069130622,"The sequences of insertions of the translocatable tetracycline-resistance element Tn10 into the repressor (cl) gene of bacteriophage lambda have been analyzed. Each insertion contains the same discrete set of Tn10 sequences flanked by a direct repetition of a 9 bp cl-gene sequence. The flanking repititions are generated by duplication of information present only in the target DNA molecule rather than by a Campbell-type recombination event between one 9 bp sequence on the target DNA and a second one provided on the incoming element. The repetitions do not contain genetic or structural information important for translocation. A genetically constructed Tn10 insertion which lacks flanking repetitions is fully functional in translocation to a new position. Tn10 insertions cluster at preferred positions along a target DNA (Kleckner et al., 1979). Sequence analysis shows that four independently isolated cl::Tn10 insertions occur at identical positions in the cl gene. We speculate that homology between Tn10 and its target, at some distance from the site of the actual recombination event, could be relevant to the preference of Tn10 for particular insertion sites."
https://openalex.org/W2059642642,"The reduction of the membrane lipids of E. coli to a nonfluid state resulted in the accumulation in the cell envelope of a high molecular weight precursor of the protoIG protein, a major outer membrane protein. The protoIG protein was as sensitive to trypsin as the mature toIG protein assembled in the outer membrane. In contrast to the toIG protein, however, the accumulated protoIG protein was easily released from the envelope fraction by both sodium lauryl sarcosinate extraction and sonication. This indicated that the precursor protein was loosely associated with the cell membrane. When a fluid lipid state was restored, the protoIG protein was processed to the mature form which was then correctly assembled in the outer membrane. These results suggest that the protoIG protein produced under nonfluid lipid conditions was properly translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane, but could not be assembled in the outer membrane due either to the reversible inhibition of the processing of the ProtoIG to the toIG protein or to the lack of interaction with a specific outer membrane component(s). Reduced lipid fluidity also caused various alterations in the biosynthesis and assembly of other membrane proteins. In addition to the toIG protein, a large number of new proteins were accumulated in the membrane. Alternatively, the matrix protein as well as the promatrix protein were not detected in the cell envelope. On the other hand, the lipoprotein was normally produced, processed, modified and assembled in the outer membrane. These results indicate that the outer membrane proteins are synthesized and assembled according to several different mechanisms, on which the physical state of the membrane has various effects."
https://openalex.org/W2062775683,"We have characterized chemotactic mutants of E. coli that appear to be defective in a common linkage of two independent receptors to the central chemotactic components. The mutants do not respond to gradients of ribose or galactose and thus are called trg (taxis to ribose and galactose), after Ordal and Adler, 1974b Ordal G.W. Adler J. Properties of mutants in galactose taxis and transport. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 517-526 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar . These trg mutants are indistinguishable from their parent in tactic response to other attractants, swimming pattern, growth rates, and transport of ribose and galactose. The mutant cells contain the usual amounts of ribose and galactose receptors, and those proteins function normally in their other role, transport of their respective ligands. The mutations, generated by insertion of translocatable drug-resistance elements (transposons), are located near 31 min on the map of the E. coli chromosome, a locus far removed from the genes coding for the ribose and galactose receptors. Trg mutants do not resemble either specific receptor mutants or che mutants. The nature of the requirement for the trg product in the response to ribose and galactose is not defined, but evidence for interference of tactic signals from the ribose and galactose receptors ( Strange and Koshland, 1976 Strange P.G. Koshland Jr., D.E. Receptor interactions in a signalling system: competition between ribose receptor and galactose receptor in the chemotaxis response. in: Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 73. 1976: 762-766 Google Scholar ) supports the idea that the product functions directly in the transmission of tactic signals from the two receptors to the flagella."
https://openalex.org/W2163419065,"Synthesis of hyaluronic acid was investigated in a cell-free system derived from a strain of Group A streptococci. Preparative procedures were improved so that an enzyme system 70 times more active than that previously reported was obtained. The hyaluronic acid synthesized could be separated into trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -insoluble fractions. On the basis of pulse-chase experiments, it was shown that the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction is a precursor of the soluble fraction. The release of the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble hyaluronic acid is specifically blocked with p-chloromercuribenzoate, without inhibition of chain elongation. The addition of butanol to trichloroacetic acid resulted in solubilization of all of the hyaluronic acid. No detectable difference in molecular size was observed between the two hyaluronic acid fractions, both of which were estimated to be more than one million daltons in size. Testicular hyaluronidase digestion of either one of the two types of hyaluronic acid yielded no high molecular weight fragments, indicating that hyaluronic acid is not bound covalently to protein. However, following incubation of enzyme assay mixtures with UDP-[14C]GlcUA, even in the absence of UDP-GlcNAc, radioactive high molecular weight hyaluronic acid was obtained which suggests that the enzyme system elongates rather than initiates hyaluronic acid chains. Tunicamycin did not inhibit hyaluronic acid synthesis, indicating lack of participation of an intermediate of pyrophosphorylpolyisoprenol type. The results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis that chain elongation of hyaluronic acid proceeds by alternate addition of monosaccharides from UDP-sugars by a membrane-bound synthesizing system followed by release of completed hyaluronic acid chains."

Among 56 spontaneous mutations at the SUP4 locus, 16 were classified as deletions as judged by their failure to recombine with any other mutations known to map within the gene. Physical analysis of each deletion confirmed the genetic result. The deletions fall into two size classes: ten are 2100 bp deletions and six are 2800 bp deletions. These results imply that the physical structure of the region surrounding the SUP4 locus, which is known to contain short repeated segments, has a direct role in promoting deletions."

An anticodon which can read all three positions of the codon according to the rules of Watson-Crick base-pairing and the wobble hypothesis is an order of magnitude more efficient than an anticodon which misreads the codon by reading only the first two positions and presumably disregards the third nucleotide of the codon. There are two seeming exceptions to this behavior: the anticodon U*AC reads the codon GUU quite efficiently and IAC is as effective as U*AC in reading the codon GUG. The significance of these exceptions is evaluated with respect to the organization and evolution of the genetic code."
https://openalex.org/W2061500791,"The structure and organization of the gene clusters coding for the two tyrosine-accepting tRNA species (tRNA1Tyr and tRNA2Tyr) on the E. coli chromosome have been determined. The mature structural sequences of the two tRNATyr genes, located on opposite sides of the E. coli chromosome, differ by only 2 bp, but sequences surrounding these portions of the genes are very different. The genes coding for tRNA1Tyr (tyrT) comprise two mature structural sequences separated by a 200 bp ""intergenic spacer."" It is known that in transducing phage, the region adjoining the CCA end of the second mature structural sequence comprises a 178 bp repeated sequence which contains an in vitro, rho-dependent transcriptional termination site. We find that these potentially genetically unstable repeated sequences are present in the E. coli chromosome with the same organization as that determined from transducing phage analyses. The gene that codes for tRNA2Tyr (tyrU) is present in a single copy and is tightly clustered with three other tRNA genes. One of these genes (to be called thrU) encodes a previously undescribed tRNA (to be called tRNA4Thr). The organization of this cluster on the E. coli chromosome is tRNA4Thr--8 bp--tRNA2Tyr--115 bp--tRNA2Gly--6 bp--tRNA3Thr. The importance of correlating structural analyses derived from specialized transducing phage with those determined for the chromosome itself is demonstrated by results which show that out of four independently isolated tRNATyr transducing phage, two carrying the tRNA1Tyr genes [phi80psu3+,- (Cambridge) and phi80sus2psu3+ (Kyoto)] and two carrying the tRNA2Tyr gene (lambdarifd 18 and lambdah80dglyTsu+36), only the first phage from each group has the same gene organization as that found in the E. coli chromosome."

The recombinant DNAs were packaged into infectious phage particles in vitro and amplified by growth of plaques on the Escherichiu coli host DP50 sup F. Twelve recombinants containing globin gene sequences were identified by their ability to hybridize to globin Q’P]cDNA and four of these were selected for further study. DNA prepared from these clones was digested with various restriction endonucleases and the products analyzed by agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Restriction fragments containing the globin genes were identified by hybridization following transfer to nitrocellulose filters. Clones 1,2, and 4 appear to contain overlapping sequences in the inserted goat DNA while clone 3 exhibits a unique pattern of restriction enzyme fragments. Orientation experiments show that the globin gene coding sequences are located in the (I) strand of clones 1,2, and 3, and in the (r) strand of clone 4. Cell-free translation of goat globin mRNAs which hybridize to the recombinant clones show that clones 1, 2, and 4 contain yor fi-globin sequences but not those for a-globin.

https://openalex.org/W2033114193,"Abstract Integration of bacteriophage λ DNA into the chromosome of its E. coli host proceeds via a site-specific recombination between specific loci ( att sites) on the phage and bacterial chromosomes. Infection of an E. coli host deleted for the primary bacterial att site results in λ integration with reduced efficiency at a number of different att scattered around the E. coli chromosome. The first DNA sequence analysis of such a secondary att site, that occurring in the gal T gene, is reported here, and several features pertinent to the mechanism of int -dependent site-specific recombination are discussed. Previous studies have shown that the crossover in int -dependent recombination must be somewhere within a 15 bp sequence (core region) common to the phage and primary bacterial att sites, as well as to the left and right prophage att sites which are at the junctures between prophage and host DNA. Comparison of the gal T secondary prophage att sites with the primary prophage att sites allows determination of the analogous region in the gal T secondary att site. The 15 bp sequence thus identified shows an interrupted homology (8 out of 15) with the wild-type core. The extent and arrangement of nonhomologous bases allow precise placement of the crossover point for this recombination to the +4–+5 internucleotide bond of the core region. Sequences flanking the core region show no obvious homology with analogous sequences of the phage or primary bacterial att sites. Comparison of the gal T left prophage att site with the analogous wild-type site is of particular interest and is discussed in relation to binding studies with purified int protein."

https://openalex.org/W2105563962,"70 S Escherichia coli ribosomes were reacted with the fluorescent dye N-(iodoacetylaminoethyl)-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonic acid for 10 min under mild conditions. The resulting ribosomes were fully active. 30 S subunits isolated from these particles were also fully active. They contain approximately 0.7 eq of fluorescent dye. Nearly all of it is attached to protein S18. Competitive reaction with N-ethylmaleimide implies that the fluorescent dye is located at cysteine 10 of the protein. The labeled 30 S particles will recombine with 50 S subunits to form stable 70 S particles. Thus the procedures we have developed allow the large scale preparation of an active fluorescent conjugate of the 70 S ribosome. The fluorescence of the 70 S particles is sensitive to the binding of mRNA, showing both quenching and a shift in emission spectra. Thus it affords a simple way to quantitate mRNA binding directly. In pilot studies without tRNA, the binding constant of the initiation triplet codon adenylyl-(3' leads to 5')-uridylyl-(3' leads to 5')-guanosine to 70 S ribosome was found to be an order of magnitude larger than that of polyuridylic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2115077137,"Abstract Cibacron Blue 3G-A (CB3G-A, I) was investigated as a ternary complex analogue of lactate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase as had been suggested earlier (Stellwagen, E. (1977) Accts. Chem. Res. 10, 92-98). CB3G-A and Procion Brilliant Blue (PBB, II), a structural isomer of the Cibacron dye without the sulfonated benzoyl moiety, were attached covalently to Sepharose CL-6B. The two enzymes were adsorbed to the columns and then eluted by substrates in various combinations. CB3G-A and PBB interact similarly with the two enzymes in spite of the structural differences between the dyes indicating that the specific structure of CB3G-A is not a ternary complex analogue. Inhibition studies of phosphoglycerate kinase by CB3G-A suggest that 2 molecules of dye bind per monomer and are consistent with multiple substrate binding sites. It is suggested that the kinetic mechanism of phosphoglycerate kinase is best described as steady state random."
https://openalex.org/W2008790089,"Macrophage migration inhibition factor (MIF) derived from human lymphoid cell lines was found to lose biologic activity on dialysis. Although activity was not recovered in the dialyzate, mixing experiments demonstrated that the components in the retentate and dialyzate could reassociate to restore activity. The fragment of larger molecular weight (less than 10,000) could inhibit the activity of intact MIF, whereas the smaller molecular weight fragment (5,000 to 10,000) could not. These findings suggest that human MIF is composed of at least two noncovalently linked subunits. In analogy to the situation for certain bacterial toxins, one of these may represent an attachment piece for a target cell membrane receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1541266449,"N-delta-(Phosphonoacetyl)-L-ornithine is a potent inhibitor of the Escherichia coli L-ornithine carbamoyltransferase (Ki = 0.77 microM, pH 8.0, 37 degrees C). Nevertheless, the analog does not cross the bacterial membrane. Therefore we have designed a tripeptide, glycylglycyl-N-delta-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-ornithine, to take advantage of the broad specificity of the oligopeptide permease system of the bacterium. A lag effect, related to the tripeptide concentration, was observed in the growth of the wild type P4X strain. At high concentration (greater than or equal to 0.75 mM) the peptide appears to be bacteriostatic and the cells which escape this action were characterized gentically as mutants devoid of the oligopeptide transport system. It was shown that the in vivo cellular target of the toxic tripeptide is solely restricted to L-ornithine carbamoyl-transferase and that the tripeptide is probably split in the cell to permit an effective inhibition by N-delta-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-ornithine. Resistance of the wild type cells to moderate levels (less than 0.75 mM) of the phosphonic analog is accompanied by a derepression of the L-ornithine carbamoyltransferase activity. The P4XB2 strain, which is an arg R regulatory mutant, has a reduced lag effect in the presence of the tripeptide and appears to react to the intoxication by a further adjustment of the L-ornithine carbamoyltransferase cellular level."
https://openalex.org/W1976286147,"IT would be convenient to be able to measure the antibody response to alloantigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) at a cellular level. As MHC alloantigens are expressed on erythrocyte membranes in mice one might suppose that a conventional Jerne plaque assay with enumeration of haemolytic plaque-forming cells (allo-PFC) against a lawn of suitable allogeneic erythrocytes would be straightforward. In fact such assays have proved difficult, with very few plaques being detected1,2. We have found the same problem in detecting allo-PFC in the spleens of alloimmunised rats. Although alloantisera raised in appropriate strain combinations have a high titre in a direct complement dependent haemolytic assay (Fig. 1) emphasising the potential value of this convenient assay for alloantibody in the rat3,4, very few allo-PFC were found in spleen cell suspensions from hyperimmunised donors. We show here that the discrepancy may be due to the homogeneity of the antibody product of a single PFC compared with the heterogeneity of serum antibody."
