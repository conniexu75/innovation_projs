https://openalex.org/W2068637730,"THE development of methods for extracting and assaying the juvenile hormone of insects1 has encouraged a search for the same biological activity in animals other than insects. Schneiderman and Gilbert have reported the first progress in this direction. Ether extracts of various invertebrates, including Hydrozoa, Polychaeta, Oligochaeta, Holothuroidea, Balanoglossida and Decapoda, give positive tests for juvenile hormone when assayed on pupæ of the silkworm, Antheraea polyphemus2. Equally surprising is the demonstration of juvenile hormone activity in certain crude aqueous extracts of bovine adrenals3."

Ling–Gerard micro-pipettes were filled with 3 M potassium chloride. They had a tip resistance of 30–50 megohms, and were checked for tip potentials by Adrian's method1. Any showing tip potentials greater than 2 mV. were discarded. Penetrations were observed microscopically under a magnification of 600."

https://openalex.org/W1968483718,"IN a recent paper on root and stalk rot of field corn in south-western Ontario1, we reported that stalk-rotting fungi do not invade the stalks of young corn plants. Subsequent experiments have been designed to investigate whether or not young corn stalks contain substances which will inhibit the growth of these fungi. Loomis et al. 2 found resistance factors in corn which were effective against the European corn borer, Pyrausta nubilalis (Hubn.), as well as Penicillium chrysogenum and other organisms. Virtanen et al. 3 isolated antifungal factors from wheat, maize and rye which inhibited Fusarium sp., Penicilliumsp. and a wide range of other micro-organisms. In the present communication results are presented which demonstrate that extracts from young corn stalks inhibit growth of two stalk-rotting organisms, Fusarium moniliforme Sheld. and Gibberella zeae (Schw.) Petch."

It was of interest, therefore, to investigate the metabolic behaviour and biological properties of this insecticide."

In every case a characterization of abnormal serum components was carried out previously, using free-boundary electrophoresis3, analytical ultracentrifuging4, agar gel and immuno-electrophoresis5."

https://openalex.org/W1985876311,"CASEASE, the proteolytic, casein-hydrolysing enzyme, has been reported in many bacteria. It has not hitherto been detected in the protozoan, Entamoeba histolytica. In earlier studies, Nakamura1 reported the absence of casease in certain strains of the amœbae. It was thought that the failure to demonstrate the enzyme might have been due to the comparatively large amounts of casein in the assay plates. Therefore, the experiments were repeated using a modification of the same method but incorporating smaller concentrations of casein in the test plates."
https://openalex.org/W1965284720,"THE ‘activation’ of the carboxyl groups in amino-acids is often assumed to be an indispensable preliminary stage in the biosynthesis of protein. The rate of the activation is known to vary with various amino-acids. The question arises whether there is any relation between the rate of activation of an amino-acid and its content in the protein. The silk-glands of the silkworm lend themselves particularly well to the study of such a problem since they produce two well-defined proteins, the amino-acid composition of which is known. While the posterior silk-gland produces ‘fibroin’, which contains 42 per cent of glycine and 28 per cent of alanine, the middle silk-gland produces ‘sericin’ containing 30 per cent of serine1. We have studied the activation of a number of amino-acids present in these two proteins of the silkworm caterpillars (Bombyx mori L.). The ‘pH 5 enzymes’ were obtained from the posterior and middle silk-glands as well as from the haemolymph. The hydroxamic method was used to determine the rate of the activation of the carboxyl groups in the amino-acids. The composition of the enzymatic mixture was approximately the same as that referred to by Davie, Koningsberger and Lipmann2. The results which we obtained are given in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W2084064607,"STIMULATED by the findings of Young and Inman1 and Brown2 that the capsule of salmonid eggs can be classified as a pseudokeratin, we have recently made X-ray studies of the egg membrane of the brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis. The membrane from the fresh unfertilized egg was washed with Ringer's solution to remove traces of egg contents and dried at room temperature. For analysis a Laue-type diffraction camera was used, with a flat film cassette 4.8 cm. from the specimen. The diagram obtained with copper Ka radiation, either vertical or parallel to the surface of the dry specimen, was a continuous halo with two main peaks at about 4.5 A. and 13 A. respectively (Fig. 1). As is also seen in Fig. 1, there is a sharp ring surrounding the whole halo. However, examination reveals that this ring coincides with the strongest line of sodium chloride, 2.81 A., and is wholly lost from membranes which have been washed with fresh water prior to desiccation. Consequently, it may be assumed that this ring pattern is not characteristic of the egg membrane, but is merely caused by adherent crystals of sodium chloride from the washing medium."
