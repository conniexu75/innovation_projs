The activation mechanisms of this key kinase are well characterized. In contrast, inactivation of PKB signaling by phosphatases is less well understood. To study the dynamics of PKB signaling in live cells, we generated a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter for PKB activity that reversibly responds to stimuli activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Specifically, phosphorylation of the reporter expressed in mammalian cells causes changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer, allowing real-time imaging of phosphorylation catalyzed by PKB. Because of its reversibility, the reporter also allows termination of PKB signaling by phosphatases to be monitored. We found that PKB signaling in the cytosol was more rapid and more transient compared with that in the nucleus, suggesting the presence of differentially regulated phosphatase activity in these two compartments. Furthermore, targeting of the reporter to the plasma membrane, where PKB is activated, resulted in accelerated and prolonged response compared with the response in the cytosol, suggesting that release of PKB or its substrates from the membrane is required for desensitization of PKB signaling. These data reveal spatio-temporal gradients of both signal propagation and signal termination in PKB signaling.

In 1991 it was identified as the transforming component of AKT8, a virus correlating with a high incidence of spontaneous lymphoma in mice, and named Akt (1Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In the same year, two other groups isolated the same kinase via its homology to protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) and designated it Rac (related to the A and C kinases) (2Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and PKB (3Coffer P.J. Woodgett J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). There are three isozymes in mammals: Akt1/PKBα, Akt2/PKBβ, and Akt3/PKBγ. While the kinase is referred to by these two names, PKB and Akt, herein it will be referred to as PKB. PKB contains an NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain followed by a kinase domain and a short COOH-terminal regulatory tail containing an activating phosphorylation site (4Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). PKB is activated by recruitment to membranes following stimulation of growth factor receptors. Briefly, activated growth factor receptors lead to plasma membrane recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which leads to the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) at the plasma membrane. The PH domain of PKB binds to the newly formed PIP3 resulting in translocation of the kinase to the plasma membrane (5Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P.

Once at the membrane, PKB becomes activated via two sequential phosphorylation steps, first by its upstream kinase PDK-1 on Thr308 within its activation loop, and next via autophosphorylation at Ser473 within the COOH-terminal hydrophobic motif (9Alessi D.R.

PKB is maximally active when phosphorylated at both regulatory sites. Once phosphorylated, active PKB disengages from the plasma membrane and translocates through the cytosol to distinct subcellular compartments including the nucleus (13Brownawell A.M. Kops G.J.

Some well characterized downstream substrates of PKB include Bad, the family of forkhead transcription factors, GSK3, and the NF-κB regulator IKK; phosphorylation of these substrates leads to an inhibition of apoptosis or directly promotes cell survival (15Chang F. Lee J.T. Navolanic P.M. Steelman L.S. Shelton J.G. Blalock W.L. Franklin R.A. McCubrey J.A. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 590-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of PKB activation has been well characterized, the molecular mechanisms of PKB desensitization and inactivation are poorly understood. We are interested in exploring the balance within the cell between PKB activity and phosphatase activities to elucidate mechanisms by which PKB signaling is regulated and terminated. The standard approach to monitoring PKB activity is through immunoblotting to detect phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473. This biochemical approach does not allow localized PKB activation to be monitored in live cells. The advent of genetically encoded fluorescent reporters provides a unique approach to elucidating the dynamic interplay between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in live cells in real time (16Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar, 17Sato M. Umezawa Y. Methods. 2004; 32: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Genetically encoded fluorescent reporters generally consist of two different fluorescent proteins connected by a phosphoaminoacid-binding domain and a kinase substrate sequence (16Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar, 17Sato M. Umezawa Y.

Phosphorylation of the substrate causes intramolecular complexation by the phosphoaminoacid-binding domain. The resulting conformational change alters fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the fluorescent proteins, enabling one to visualize kinase signaling in live cells. Umezawa and colleagues (19Sasaki K. Sato M. Umezawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) recently developed such a reporter for PKB, dubbed “Aktus,” but overexpression of PKB was required to see clear signals from Aktus. Here we present BKAR (B kinase activity reporter), a novel PKB reporter. The predominant distinctions between BKAR and Aktus are the phosphoaminoacid-binding domain and its corresponding substrate sequence. We chose to utilize the FHA2 domain as the phosphoaminoacid-binding domain as we had previously utilized it in the context of CKAR (C kinase activity reporter) (18Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar); its binding affinity to the phosphorylated substrate sequence was such that CKAR was sensitive to endogenous kinase signaling but also was reversible upon kinase inhibition. We show that BKAR responds reversibly to endogenous PKB activation, allowing detection of both activation and termination of signaling downstream of PKB. Through use of a plasma membrane-targeted BKAR, we show that phosphorylation of PKB substrates at the membrane occurs more rapidly than cytosolic substrates and that there is a further delay before nuclear substrates are phosphorylated. In addition, BKAR localized in the nucleus and plasma membrane is dephosphorylated slower than BKAR in the cytosol. These data reveal a spatio-temporal gradient of signal propagation and termination in PKB signaling. Materials—PDGF-BB, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PdBu), calyculin A, LY294002, and wortmannin were obtained from Calbiochem. PKB P-T308, PKB P-S473, and PKB antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Biomax MR film used for Western analyses was from Eastman Kodak Co. All other materials were reagent-grade. Plasmid Constructs—BKAR was generated through substitution of a PKB substrate sequence, RKRDRLGTLGI, for the substrate sequence within pcDNA3-CKAR (18Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) by PCR. The phosphoacceptor threonine was mutated to an alanine to create BKAR-T/A following the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). MyrPalm-BKAR was generated by PCR with a primer containing the 5′ 21 bp of the gene for Lyn kinase. The corresponding 7 amino acids are known to become myristoylated and palmitoylated. A fluorescent-tagged PKB-PH domain was generated by subcloning the DNA encoding monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) (20Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar) to that encoding the PH domain of PKB. For in vitro experiments, BKAR was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pRSET B (Invitrogen). Protein Purification—pRSET-BKAR or pRSET-BKAR-T/A was transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli. A single colony was grown for 2 days at room temperature. Pelleted cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization and French press in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm DTT, 300 nm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm bestatin, 500 nm benzamidine, and 500 ng/ml leupeptin. BKAR was purified from cleared lysates by nickel chelation chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Following washes, BKAR was eluted in 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm DTT containing 200 mm imidazole. Imidazole was removed by dialysis. Protein yield was estimated by CFP absorption at 434 nm. Kinase Assays and in Vitro Spectroscopy—For kinase assays, 1 μg of purified BKAR or BKAR-T/A was incubated with 100 ng of pure Akt1/PKBα (ΔPH, S473D) (1739 units/mg, Upstate Biotechnology), PKA (4290 units/mg, S. Taylor's laboratory) or PKC-βII (1240 units/mg) at 30 °C for the indicated times. Buffer compositions were as follows: 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm DTT, 200 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2 for PKB; 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm DTT, 200 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2 for PKA; and 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 500 mm CaCl2, with 140 μm phosphatidlylserine, 3.8 μm diacylglycerol vesicles for PKC. For radioactive assays, [γ-32P]ATP was included in the reaction, BKAR and BKAR-T/A were isolated by SDS-PAGE, identified by Coomassie Blue staining, and excised, and 32P incorporation was measured by scintillation counting. For analysis by Western blotting, BKAR or BKAR-T/A was incubated with the designated kinase for 0 or 15 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt/PKB substrate antibody (Cell Signaling). Western blots were analyzed by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal (Pierce). Fluorescence emission scans were performed on BKAR phosphorylated by PKB (+ATP) or unphosphorylated (–ATP) by exciting at 434 nm to excite CFP. Cell Transfection—NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 10% bovine calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated onto sterilized glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes prior to transfection. Transient transfection was carried out using Effectene (Qiagen) for NIH3T3 cells or FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) for COS-7 cells. Cells were serum-starved within 24 h post-transfection and imaged within the following 24 h. Cell Imaging—Cells were washed one time in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Cellgro) and imaged in HBSS in the dark at room temperature. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.) using a MicroMax digital camera (Roper-Princeton Instruments) controlled by MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging, Corp.). All optical filters were obtained from Chroma Technologies. Data were collected through a 10% neutral density filter. CFP and FRET images were obtained every 15 s through a 420/20-nm excitation filter, a 450-nm dichroic mirror, and a 475/40-nm or 535/25-nm emission filter for CFP and FRET, respectively. A YFP image was obtained as a control for photobleaching through a 495/10-nm excitation filter, a 505-nm dichroic mirror, and a 535/25-nm emission filter. RFP images were obtained through a 568/55-nm excitation filter, a 600-nm dichroic mirror, and a 653/95-nm emission filter. Excitation and emission filters were switched in filter wheels (Lambda 10–2, Sutter). Integration times were 200 ms for CFP and FRET and 50–100 ms for YFP. Western Blotting—NIH3T3 cells were grown to near confluence in 60-mm dishes. Cells were washed once in HBSS and treated for the indicated times with 50 ng/ml PDGF in HBSS at room temperature. Cells were lysed and separated through a low speed spin to isolate the cytosolic fractions as described (21Lim M.A. Kikani C.K. Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14006-14011Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One-third of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to determine the relative amounts of PKB Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation over time. Western blots were analyzed by chemiluminescence. Design of BKAR—BKAR, a B kinase activity reporter, is a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter designed to monitor PKB-mediated phosphorylation in live cells. Its modular structure is analogous to the previously described PKC activity reporter, CKAR, having only a small region (the substrate phosphorylation sequence) modified to make it a specific readout of PKB signaling (18Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). BKAR consists of the FRET pair mCFP (cyan fluorescent protein rendered monomeric by the mutation A206K) and mYFP 2The YFP variant with enhanced stability, citrine, was used (21Lim M.A. Kikani C.K. Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14006-14011Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). (yellow fluorescent protein likewise with A206K), bracketing an FHA2 phosphothreonine-binding domain and a consensus PKB phosphorylation sequence (22Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 23Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence, RKRDRLGTLGI, where the underlined T is the phospho-acceptor residue, was designed based on a combination of data describing optimal PKB phosphorylation consensus sequences (24Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and information identifying which residues are critical for FHA2 domain binding (25Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Analysis of this sequence using Scansite (scansite.mit.edu) suggested that it is optimal for PKB phosphorylation and suboptimal for phosphorylation by other basophilic kinases; PKA and PKC were predicted to be the next most likely kinases to phosphorylate the sequence. As with CKAR, unphosphorylated BKAR is in a conformation resulting in FRET from the donor molecule CFP to the acceptor YFP. Phosphorylation of the threonine within the substrate sequence triggers an intramolecular clamp with the FHA2, leading to a decrease in FRET (Fig. 1A). In Vitro Phosphorylation of BKAR by PKB—To determine whether BKAR can serve as a PKB substrate, BKAR was expressed in bacterial cells as a His-tagged fusion protein, purified, and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by a constitutively active construct of PKB, Akt1/PKBα (ΔPH, S473D). Fig. 1B shows that pure PKB phosphorylated pure BKAR in vitro with a t½ of ∼5 min under the conditions of the assay. Importantly, a construct of BKAR in which the phosphoacceptor threonine was mutated to alanine (BKAR-T/A) was not phosphorylated revealing that PKB specifically phosphorylates the threonine within the designed substrate sequence of BKAR. The stoichiometry of the phosphorylation was routinely 0.3 mol of phosphate per mol of reporter, suggesting possible aggregation or masking of some of the phosphorylation sites in vitro. Because PKA and PKC were both identified by Scansite as the next most likely kinases to phosphorylate the consensus sequence in BKAR, we tested whether these enzymes phosphorylated the threonine in the consensus sequence. Phosphorylation at this site was detected with a phospho-specific antibody to the consensus PKB phosphorylation sequence. Fig. 1C shows that this antibody labeled BKAR, but not the BKAR-T/A construct, following an in vitro kinase assay using PKB as the kinase but not when PKA or PKC βII were used. Thus, neither PKA nor PKC recognize the phospho-acceptor site on BKAR in vitro. Curiously, analysis of total phosphorylation by monitoring 32P incorporation revealed that PKC βII (but not PKA) phosphorylated BKAR to a stoichiometry double that catalyzed by PKB. This phosphorylation also occurred on BKAR-T/A reflecting silent phosphorylations of the GFPs (data not shown). Having demonstrated that pure PKB can recognize and phosphorylate BKAR on the threonine within its substrate sequence, we next addressed the effect of this phosphorylation on FRET between the donor/acceptor pairs on the reporter. Analysis of the emission spectrum of BKAR upon excitation at 434 nm (excitation of CFP) revealed a change in FRET upon phosphorylation. Specifically, 15 min of incubation with pure PKB resulted in an increase in CFP emission (around 475 nm) reflecting a loss in energy transfer to YFP, and an decrease in YFP emission reflecting a decrease in FRET. Furthermore, treatment of BKAR with trypsin to cleave the reporter and separate the amino-terminal CFP from the carboxyl-terminal YFP confirmed that the peak observed around 530 nm (YFP emission) was a result of FRET from CFP to YFP. Thus, phosphorylation of BKAR at the threonine within the substrate sequence induces a change in FRET. However, the critical test of the specificity of BKAR as a reporter to visualize kinase signaling is to examine its responses in living cells. BKAR Reports PKB, but Not PKA or PKC, Activity in Live Cells—To examine the specificity of BKAR phosphorylation in live cells, NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with BKAR and then serum-starved overnight before imaging. Fig. 2A shows that BKAR responded to PDGF stimulation within a few minutes after drug delivery and this response reached its maximum level 15 min after PDGF treatment, as evidenced by an increased FRET ratio (cyan emission/yellow emission). Note that the data are plotted as the ratio of cyan fluorescence (which increases as FRET decreases) to yellow emission (which decreases as FRET decreases). To determine whether this change in the FRET ratio was due to phosphorylation at the threonine within the PKB consensus sequence in BKAR, we examined the response of BKAR-T/A in which the phospho-acceptor threonine had been mutated to an alanine. Serum-starved NIH3T3 cells expressing BKAR-T/A did not show any change in the FRET ratio in response to PDGF treatment. Thus, the observed change in the FRET ratio of BKAR results from phosphorylation at the designed PKB phosphorylation site. To further explore the specificity of BKAR in vivo, we tested whether activation of PKA or PKC altered the FRET response of the reporter. Treatment of serum-starved NIH3T3 cells expressing BKAR with 10 μm forskolin to activate PKA did not result in an increase in the FRET ratio, confirming in vitro data that PKA does not effectively phosphorylate BKAR (Fig. 2B). (Note the slight decrease in FRET ratio suggesting a change in basal BKAR phosphorylation, perhaps from activation of cyclic AMP-sensitive phosphatases). Importantly, treatment of cells with 200 nm PdBu, a potent activator of PKC, caused no significant change in the FRET ratio. Subsequent addition of PDGF resulted in a robust FRET ratio change (Fig. 2C). These data reveal that BKAR is not sensitive to either PKA or PKC activation. We next addressed the reversibility of BKAR as a PKB activity reporter by examining the effect of inhibiting PI 3-kinase, and hence PKB, on the PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the reporter. Fig. 2D shows that PDGF stimulation resulted in an increase in the FRET ratio and this response began to level off typically around 10 min after PDGF treatment. Addition of LY294002 and wortmannin to inhibit PI 3-kinase caused a decrease in the FRET ratio (Fig. 2D), with the signal returning to baseline. This demonstrates that BKAR responds specifically to PI 3-kinase signaling, which is directly upstream of PKB signaling. Taken together, these data clearly indicate that BKAR specifically and reversibly reports PKB activity in vivo. In Fig. 2E, we compared the sensitivity of BKAR to the described previously reporter, Aktus. We observed no FRET change from Aktus in response to endogenous PKB activation in starved NIH3T3 cells (data not shown) so we moved to a more robust PKB signaling system. EGF stimulation of COS-7 cells overexpressing PKBα and BKAR routinely results in a robust response that is reversed by addition of LY294002. Under the same conditions, cells expressing Aktus showed a barely detectable response to EGF (Fig. 2E). As reported previously (19Sasaki K. Sato M. Umezawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), Aktus is suitable for examining the activity of localized and overexpressed PKB; in contrast, BKAR allows sensitive monitoring of endogenous activity. PKB Signaling in the Cytosol and Nucleus—BKAR distributes throughout both the cytosol and the nucleus allowing analysis of PKB signaling from these two areas side by side in the same cell (Fig. 3A). Analyses of the FRET ratio changes from these two regions revealed differential timing of BKAR phosphorylation following growth factor stimulation. Specifically, the t½ for maximal response of BKAR in the cytosol was approximately three times faster than that of BKAR localized in the nucleus. This delay in nuclear PKB signaling likely reflects the time it takes for activated PKB to translocate into the nuclear compartment; however, the delay could also result from higher phosphatase activity in the nucleus compared with the cytosol. To discriminate between these two possibilities, cells were treated with calyculin A, a potent protein phosphatase-1 and protein phosphatase-2 inhibitor, prior to stimulation with PDGF. Fig. 3B shows that the delay in the nuclear response compared with the response in the cytosol was maintained following inhibition of phosphatase activity. Note that the magnitude of the response was enhanced more than 3-fold in the presence of calyculin, revealing robust phosphatase activity in these cells (compare maximal response in Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, when PDGF-stimulated cells were treated with LY294002 and wortmannin to inhibit PI 3-kinase, cytosolic BKAR was dephosphorylated much more rapidly than nuclear BKAR, revealing much more robust phosphatase activity toward BKAR in the cytosol compared with the nucleus (Fig. 3C). Thus, the delay in the nuclear response of BKAR does not arise from increased phosphatase activity in the nucleus. Rather, our data are consistent with the delay in nuclear signaling resulting from delay in the phosphorylation step. Cytosolic BKAR—Fig. 3A shows that cytosolic BKAR is considerably more sensitive to dephosphorylation than nuclear BKAR; extended imaging from these regions depicts the onset of a decline in the FRET ratio from cytosolic BKAR typically after 15 min of PDGF stimulation, whereas the nuclear BKAR response was sustained over this time. The decay of the cytosolic BKAR response could reflect an increase in phosphatase activity acting on PKB or on the reporter itself. Alternatively, the integrity of cytosolic BKAR could be affected following PKB phosphorylation. To examine these possibilities, starved NIH3T3 cells were treated with PDGF and the BKAR response was monitored until the FRET ratio had peaked and was beginning to decline. At this point, the cells were treated with the phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A. Calyculin A treatment not only prevented further decline in the FRET ratio, it resulted in a robust increase in the BKAR response. This confirms that cytosolic BKAR is still intact and competent to report kinase activity; furthermore this indicates that PKB is still active in the cytosol after 15 min of PDGF treatment (Fig. 3D). Thus, the decline in BKAR phosphorylation following PDGF stimulation reflects phosphatase action. To explore whether the dephosphorylation of BKAR reflects inactivation of PKB by phosphatases, or specific dephosphorylation of the substrate, we examined the phosphorylation state of PKB following PDGF treatment. PKB is activated via phosphorylation first at its activation loop sequence (Thr308) and subsequently via autophosphorylation at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). It is this dually phosphorylated PKB species that is most active. Starved NIH3T3 cells were treated with PDGF for the indicated times up to 1 h under the same conditions used for cell imaging. Cytosolic fractions were isolated, and the phosphorylation state of PKB was analyzed by Western blotting. Fig. 3E shows that PKB was rapidly phosphorylated following PDGF treatment, and this phosphorylation state was sustained for at least 1 h after growth factor stimulation. Thus, cytosolic PKB appears active (as measured by PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473) during the time at which cytosolic BKAR displays a decline in the FRET ratio. Most simply, these experiments suggest that phosphatases are acting on BKAR and competing against PKB phosphorylation of the reporter 10–15 min after growth factor treatment. PKB Signaling at the Membrane—PKB is first activated at the plasma membrane, where it is recruited and phosphorylated, following PI 3-kinase activation. Thus, we were interested in monitoring PKB activity at the membrane itself. To do this, we generated a membrane-targeted BKAR (MyrPalm-BKAR) in which the seven NH2-terminal residues (derived from Lyn kinase) encode for myristoylation and palmitoylation modifications of BKAR, thereby tethering it to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A) (18Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 22Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows that the kinetics of the MyrPalm-BKAR response following PDGF stimulation were much more rapid than the kinetics described above for cytosolic BKAR. Typically, the t½ for maximal response of the membrane-tethered reporter was about three times faster than that observed for cytosolic BKAR. This phosphorylation was sustained for as long as cells were imaged (over 20 min) (data not shown) revealing that equilibrium is achieved between kinase and phosphatase function at the membrane. Addition of PI 3-kinase inhibitors reversed the phosphorylation, revealing, again, the dynamic interplay between kinase and phosphatase activities in PKB signaling. These data are consistent with PKB being first activated at the membrane and also reveal that substrate phosphorylation at this location is sustained relative to that which follows in the cytosol. Overexpression of PKB-PH Domain—We took advantage of BKAR to ask two questions: 1) what are the kinetics of PIP3 formation compared with Akt activation, and 2) does overexpression of PH domains interfere with endogenous PKB signaling? To this end, we concurrently imaged the translocation of the PH domain of PKBα fused to monomeric red fluorescent protein and PKB activity using cytosolic BKAR. Fig. 5 shows that PIP3 production, as measured by PH domain translocation, occurred with a t½ of ∼0.5–1 min. These kinetics coincide with PKB activation at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4), and precede PKB activation in the cytosol, which has a t½ of ∼3–5 min (Fig. 5). These kinetics of BKAR phosphorylation (cytosolic) were comparable with those observed in the absence of overexpressed PH domain (see Fig. 2). This reveals that overexpression of a PIP3-binding PH domain does not interfere with activation or signaling of PKB. In this study we generated BKAR, a novel reporter for endogenous PKB signaling in live cells. We show that BKAR is specific for PKB signaling and is reversible, allowing monitoring of both signal propagation and signal termination. Using this reporter, we examine the kinetics and spatial distribution of PKB signaling in serum-starved cells following growth factor treatment. Our data reveal a spatio-temporal gradient of PKB signaling that initiates at the membrane, propagates through the cytosol, and is last observed in the nucleus. Using a reporter for PIP3 production, we show that the rapid activation of PKB at the membrane coincides with the kinetics of PIP3 formation. Propagation of PKB Signaling; Gradient of Phosphorylation—Monitoring BKAR at the membrane, in the cytosol and within the nucleus, reveals a temporal gradient of PKB signaling downstream of growth factor receptor stimulation. As depicted in Fig. 6, PKB is recruited to, and activated at, the plasma membrane following the production of PIP3. By targeting BKAR to the membrane, we observe very rapid kinetics of PKB signaling (t½ typically on the order of minutes) indicating that an active PKB species is generated and present at this location. This rapid activation coincides with the kinetics of PIP3 formation, as detected using a PH domain reporter for PIP3. Phosphorylation of BKAR localized in the cytosol is about three times slower. This could reflect the time required for PKB to disengage from the membrane and diffuse through the cytosol to phosphorylate BKAR. In addition, the slower kinetics of phosphorylation observed in the cytosol could result from higher phosphatase activity in this region compared with the phosphatase activity at the membrane. Phosphorylation of nuclear BKAR is typically another 3-fold slower, most likely reflecting a rate-limiting translocation of PKB into the nucleus. This lag does not result from increased phosphatase activity in the nucleus because it is also observed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors; in addition, BKAR phosphorylation is sustained in the nucleus compared with the cytosol indicating reduced phosphatase activity in this compartment. As a genetically encoded reporter, BKAR can be targeted to a number of distinct intracellular regions where PKB is known to signal. As part of this study, we also show that overexpression of a PIP3-binding PH domain does not affect PKB signaling, indicating that the local concentration of PIP3 is saturating. Termination of PKB Signaling—Protein phosphorylation is dependent upon the dynamics between active kinases and phosphatases within the cell. By monitoring BKAR, we observed differential dephosphorylation of the reporter that was dependent upon subcellular location. Membrane-targeted BKAR displayed rapid kinetics of activation with a prolonged phosphorylation that lasted as long as the cells were imaged (up to 20 min after growth factor treatment). PKB is activated at the membrane, thus the signaling kinase is concentrated in this region allowing it to efficiently compete with any phosphatase activity that might be present at the membrane. Cytosolic BKAR, on the other hand, exhibited a decay in its response following ∼10 min of growth factor treatment. This decay was not a result of dephosphorylation of PKB but likely caused by phosphatases acting directly on BKAR itself; this suggests that PKB signaling in the cytosol may be more closely regulated by cellular phosphatases that act on PKB substrates. Last, nuclear BKAR responses remained elevated following over 25 min of growth factor treatment, similar to what was observed with the membrane-tethered BKAR. In the case of nuclear BKAR, however, the results are consistent with the presence of lower levels of the relevant phosphatase activity within the nuclear compartment. Advantages of BKAR—Prior to the generation of BKAR, Umezawa and colleagues (19Sasaki K. Sato M. Umezawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) developed a PKB reporter that they termed Aktus and which was used to detect activity of overexpressed PKB. In their studies, the authors targeted this reporter to mitochondria or golgi and assayed for PKB activity at these two compartments downstream of two distinct pathways. With Aktus, the authors found that there was differential phosphorylation depending both on the location of the reporter and the specific pathway activated; specifically, 17β-estradiol was able to elicit a response from Aktus at both subcellular locations assayed, whereas insulin only elicited a response from the Golgi-targeted Aktus (19Sasaki K. Sato M. Umezawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our new PKB reporter, BKAR, offers several advantages over Aktus. First, BKAR is much more sensitive to PKB signaling as it reports endogenous PKB activity in NIH3T3 cells; the cytosolic Aktus reporter elicited no response within these same cells (data not shown). In fact, even under conditions that elicit large responses from BKAR (imaging cells that overexpress PKB), we are not able to readily detect a FRET change from Aktus (Fig. 2E). Consistent with this, the authors state that responses from Aktus were best observed when the reporter was targeted to subcellular compartments where PKB signaling has been described previously, i.e. mitochondria and Golgi, rather than when it was diffuse within the cytosol (17Sato M. Umezawa Y. Methods. 2004; 32: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Sasaki K. Sato M. Umezawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Second, BKAR distributes throughout both the cytosol and the nucleus allowing for concurrent imaging from both areas within the same cell; untargeted Aktus is present solely in the cytosol. Last, BKAR responds reversibly to PKB activity allowing one to monitor the termination of PKB signaling in live cells, either through the deactivation of PKB itself or through the increased dephosphorylation of the reporter; we were unable to address the reversibility of Aktus given the low signal upon activation under our imaging conditions, and Sasaki et al. (19Sasaki K. Sato M. Umezawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) did not show any attempts at reversal. Thus, while Aktus elegantly demonstrated the specificity of PKB signaling via its targeted versions, BKAR appears to be an improved reporter, offering more sensitivity in monitoring PKB signaling in live cells and allowing monitoring of both signal propagation and signal termination. We thank Dr. Jonathan Violin for helpful advice, Dr. Susan Taylor's laboratory for purified PKA, Qing Xiong for technical assistance, and Dr. Y. Umezawa for the Aktus construct."

During subsequent pregnancies, these parity-induced mammary epithelial cells (PI-MEC) proliferated to produce new secretory acini composed of secretory luminal cells and myoepithelium. In serial transplantation assays, PI-MEC were able to self-renew over several transplant generations and to contribute significantly to the resulting mammary outgrowths. In limiting dilution transplantation, they proliferated to produce both luminal and myoepithelial cells, comprised both lobule-limited and duct-limited epithelial outgrowths, and differentiated into all the cellular subtypes recognized in murine mammary epithelium. TGF-beta1 expression from the whey acidic protein promoter (WAP) in triply transgenic females did not prevent the appearance of PI-MEC after pregnancy despite the absence of full lactation or their ability to proliferate and produce progeny with diverse cellular fates in situ upon subsequent pregnancies. However, in transplants from triple transgenic parous females, the WAP-TGF-beta1-positive PI-MEC did not contribute to the newly recapitulated mammary outgrowths, suggesting that they were incapable of expansive cellular proliferation (self-renewal). This result is consistent with our earlier publication that WAP-TGF-beta1 expression in mammary epithelium induces premature stem cell senescence in mammary transplants and decreases mammary cancer risk in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-infected females even after multiple pregnancies."

Prothrombin is synthesized in the liver depending on the presence of vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase. The prothrombin precursor has 10 Glu residues in the N terminus that are converted into γ-carboxy-glutamic acid (Gla) residues by γ-glutamyl carboxylase. All of these Glu residues must be converted into Gla residues before prothrombin can obtain coagulation activity. In DCP, not all of the 10 Gla residues are transformed. Instead, some remain as Glu residues (6Uehara S. Gotoh K. Handa H. Honjo K. Hirayama A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1999; 289: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Reportedly, the vitamin K concentration and enzymatic activity of γ-glutamyl carboxylase are decreased significantly in HCC tissue (7Furukawa M. Nakanishi T. Okuda H. Ishida S. Obata H. Cancer. 1992; 69: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Huisse M.G. Leclercq M. Belghiti J. Flejou J.F. Suttie J.W. Bezeaud A. Stafford D.W. Guillin M.C.

Many studies consider DCP a prognostic indicator of HCC. For example, serum and tissue DCP expressions are thought to reflect the biological malignant potential of HCC (10Suehiro T. Matsumata T.

Cancer. 2001; 91: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and cell proliferation markers have been seen to correlate with tissue DCP expression in clinical pathological studies of HCC (10Suehiro T.

In exploring the structure of DCP, there are two kringle domains similar to those of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which was originally identified as a potent mitogen for mature hepatocytes (17Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar, 18Miyazawa K. Tsubouchi H. Naka D. Takahashi K.

Kringle domains are mandatory for HGF to bind with Met, and their presence implies that DCP interacts with Met. We hypothesize that DCP stimulates HCC cell proliferation through Met. Met is a membrane-spanning receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates biological responses to various tissues including cell scattering, growth stimulation, and the branching morphogenesis of cells in various tissues (19Brinkmann V. Foroutan H. Sachs M. Weidner K.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1573-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 20Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Symp. 1997; 212: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that the coupling between HGF and Met integrates biological processes, such as the invasive and metastasis progression to cancer cells (23Jeffers M. Rong S. Anver M. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 853-856PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bardelli A. Pugliese L. Comoglio P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M41-M51PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we found that DCP stimulated the proliferation of HCC cell lines. During our investigation of the receptor for DCP, DCP was found to bind with Met. The transductional apparatus of DCP was identified to activate Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)/signal transducers and activators of the transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway during cancer proliferation. These findings provide a description of a novel autocrine/paracrine growth stimulatory mechanism behind the development of HCC. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Two human HCC cell lines, Hep3B (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and PLC/PRF/5 (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Another human HCC cell line, SK-Hep-1 (ATCC), was maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma). The human colon cancer cell line HT-29 (ATCC) was cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (Sigma). All of the media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% nonessential amino acid (Sigma), 1% sodium pyruvate (Sigma), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Sigma). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Determination of DCP Levels Produced by HCC Cell Lines—DCP levels produced by HCC cell lines were determined by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Picolumi PIVKA-II™; Eisai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method uses a mouse monoclonal anti-DCP antibody coated on solid phase beads and a rabbit polyclonal anti-prothrombin that has been ruthenylated. An electrochemically triggered light reaction was quantified by an electrochemiluminescence detection system. Purification of DCP—The DCP-producing cell line PLC/PRF/5 was cultured in the presence of warfarin sodium (10 μg/ml) to enhance DCP production. DCP was purified from the conditioned media by affinity chromatography with an anti-prothrombin antibody (Eisai). The purified DCP was then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was stained with Blot-FastStain™ protein-staining reagent (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified DCP sample was developed by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-DCP antibody (Eisai). DCP could be distinguished from normal prothrombin by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis (6Uehara S. Gotoh K. Handa H. Honjo K. Hirayama A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1999; 289: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HPLC analysis was performed using a column (TSKgel; DDS-80TS, Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan). Cell Proliferation Assay—The cells were grown to confluence in 12-well plastic tissue culture plates. The cells were kept inactive for 24 h and then treated with DCP, prothrombin (Sigma), and apolipoprotein A (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) at the indicated concentrations. After a 12-h incubation, 5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each well and maintained for 8 h. The cells were treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then harvested, and we used a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) to analyze the samples. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were plated into 6-well plates and grown to confluence. After 24 h of quiescence, the cells were treated with DCP, prothrombin, HGF (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), or epidermal growth factor (Sigma) at the indicated concentrations for 15 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked using Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (Sigma) (TBS-T) buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The membranes were then incubated with anti-phospho-Met (Tyr1234/1235) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, MA), anti-phospho-Met (Tyr1349) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-JAK1 (Tyr1022/1023) antibody (Sigma), anti-phospho-STAT3 (Ser727) antibody (Sigma), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-Raf (Ser259) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-c-Myc (Thr58/Ser62) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-p85 phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-binding motif antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-phospho-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody before being developed with an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using enhanced chemiluminescence. Luciferase Gene Reporter Assay—The reporter plasmids, 30 μg of pFA2-Elk1, 30 μg of pFR-Luc (Path Detect™ Trans-Reporting System, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and 7 μg of pRL-TK control Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) per 105 cells, were co-transfected by electroporation (voltage, 300 V; capacitor, 950 microfarad; cuvette gap, 4 mm) and plated into 6-well plates. For the STAT3 activity reporter assay, 30 μg of pSTAT3-Luc (Clontech laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) and 7 μg of pRL-TK control Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) were co-transfected per 105 cells. After 36 h, the media were changed just before the following treatment to avoid the effect of self-produced DCP. The cells were stimulated with DCP (2–200 ng/ml), prothrombin (2–200 ng/ml), and/or epidermal growth factor (10 nm), and HGF (50 ng/ml) and incubated for 12 h. The cells were then lysed, and the activities of firefly and Renilla luciferases were measured sequentially with a luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Far Western Blot Analysis—DCP protein was biotinylated using biotinamido hexanoic acid 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester with an ECL biotinylation module (Sigma). The cell lysates were developed on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T and left to react overnight with biotin-labeled DCP in TBS-T containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. Excess amounts of the probe were removed by four washes in TBS-T. The membranes were incubated with ExtrAvidin™ Peroxidase (Sigma) for detection. After three times washing with TBS-T, the membrane was developed using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates containing the same amount of proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Met antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The precipitates were analyzed using 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-DCP antibody (Eisai), anti-phosphotyrosine 20 (PY-20) antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and anti-Met antibody. Inhibitors for Met-JAK-STAT Signaling Pathway—A function-blocking anti-Met antibody (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was utilized for function blocking assay against Met signaling. The cells were pretreated with function-blocking anti-Met antibody (1 μg/ml) for 1 h before DCP stimulation. JAK inhibitor AG490 and STAT3 inhibitor peptide were purchased from Calbiochem. Gene Silencing with Small Interfering RNAs—siRNA duplexes targeting STAT3 and Met sequences were obtained from Dharmacon SMART™ pool technology (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO). Control (nonsilencing, 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′) siRNA duplexes were obtained from Sigma. siRNAs were transfected into cells using the RNAiFect™ transfection reagent (Qiagen). The cells were incubated for 12 h and utilized for the following analysis. Total RNA was purified from siRNA transfected cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lamin A/C mRNA expression level was determined by real time PCR using QuantiTect™ gene expression assay system (Qiagen) and Light-Cycler™ (Roche Applied Science) to verify that nonspecific suppression did not occur by siRNA transfection. The interferences of STAT3 and Met protein expression were confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-STAT3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-Met antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Luciferase gene reporter assays for STAT3 activation and a cell proliferation assay were then performed as described above. Purification of DCP from PLC/PRF/5—The purified DCP was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and HPLC analyses. More than 99% was DCP in SDS-PAGE and densitometry analysis (Fig. 1A). The purified DCP was analyzed by Western blot with anti-DCP antibody to demonstrate that the DCP was uncontaminated (Fig. 1B). Purified DCP from warfarin sodium-treated PLC/PRF/5 cells contained no detectable level of normal prothrombin in HPLC analysis (Fig. 1C, lower panel). HPLC analysis showed that DCP produced by PLC/PRF/5 cell has 6–8 Gla residues. This result is compatible with a former report (6Uehara S. Gotoh K. Handa H. Honjo K. Hirayama A. Clin. Chim.

Self-production of DCP by HCC Cell Lines—The DCP produced by each cell line was determined using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5 produced DCP at rates of 0.49 ± 0.04 and 2.33 ± 0.04 (ng/ml/day/106 cells), respectively. SK-Hep-1 and HT-29 did not produce a detectable DCP level. DCP Stimulates the Proliferation of HCC Cell Lines—To investigate the mitogenic effect of DCP, we incorporated [3H]thymidine into DNA as an index of proliferation. As shown in Fig. 2, increasing concentrations of DCP led to increased incorporation of [3H]thymidine in each cell line. DCP stimulated cell proliferation 1.50 ± 0.16-fold at a concentration of 20 ng/ml in the DCP self-producing Hep3B cell, whereas normal prothrombin stimulated cell proliferation 1.15 ± 0.07-fold at the same concentration. This effect reached a plateau with a DCP stimulus of 200 ng/ml (data not shown). In SK-Hep-1 non-DCP-producing cells, DCP showed a significant potential mitogenic effect of 2.10 ± 0.05-fold at a concentration of 20 ng/ml. Normal prothrombin hardly affected proliferation of the SK-Hep-1 cell line. In fact, cell proliferation in SK-Hep-1 cells was not even induced with 100 μg/ml of prothrombin, the physiological plasma concentration (data not shown). Moreover, we assessed the effect of DCP in colon cancer cell line HT-29, which does not produce DCP but expresses Met. DCP stimulated cell proliferation 1.91 ± 0.40-fold at a concentration of 20 ng/ml in HT-29 cells, but prothrombin had little effect. Moreover, apolipoprotein A was employed as a control serum protein that contains kringle domains (25McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein A did not affect cell proliferative activity at its physiological serum concentration (280 ng/ml) in HCC cells (1.13 ± 0.17-, 0.90 ± 0.04-, and 0.96 ± 0.03-fold for Hep3B, SK-Hep1, and HT-29, respectively; not significant). DCP Binds to HGF Receptor Met and Phosphorylates Tyrosine Residues of Met—Met expression in Hep3B, SK-Hep-1, and HT-29 cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Far Western blot analysis using a biotin-labeled DCP probe showed that DCP interacted with Met. In all of the cell lysates, a 145-kDa protein was detected by this probe and identified as Met (Fig. 3A). The extracts of Hep3B, SK-Hep-1, and HT-29 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Met antibodies and blotted with an anti-DCP antibody. When anti-Met antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, DCP could be visualized with an anti-DCP antibody (Fig. 3B). When Met is activated by its ligand HGF, specific tyrosine residues are reported to be autophosphorylated (26Naldini L. Vigna E. Ferracini R. Longati P. Gandino L. Prat M. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 27Bardelli A. Longati P. Williams T.A. Benvenuti S. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol.

HGF treatment induced the autophosphorylation of Met as detected by the anti-PY-20 antibody in Hep3B cells (Fig. 3C). In the phosphorylation analysis using the anti-PY-20 antibody, DCP did not induce phosphorylation of Met as did HGF. Therefore, we conducted further analysis of Met phosphorylation. Activation of the Met receptor results in the autophosphorylation of tyrosines 1234 and 1235 of the tyrosine kinase domain and tyrosines 1349 and 1356 of the multifunctional docking site (27Bardelli A.

In this study, DCP phosphorylated only those tyrosine residues located in the kinase activation loop (Tyr1234/1235) and not the C-terminal tail (Tyr1349), whereas HGF phosphorylated residues in both locations in Hep3B (Fig. 3D). Similar results were obtained with SK-Hep-1 cells (data not shown). DCP Stimulates the JAK-STAT Pathway through Met—To identify the signaling pathway following DCP stimulation, cell lines were treated with DCP, and JAK1 phosphorylation was examined using Western blot analysis. Following exposure of cells with DCP, JAK1 (Tyr1022/1023) was phosphorylated in Hep3B (Fig. 4A). JAK is known as the mediator of phosphorylation of STATs (30Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 31Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 32Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). We observed that DCP phosphorylated STAT3 in Hep3B by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with SK-Hep-1 cells (data not shown). A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to determine whether DCP induced activation of the STAT3-responsive element. As shown in Fig. 4B, DCP induced a 1.82 ± 0.08-fold increase in luciferase activity in Hep3B cells. Prothrombin phosphorylated STAT3 but induced only a 1.24 ± 0.05-fold increase in luciferase activity in the STAT3-responsive element. To determine whether the biological effect of DCP is brought out through the Met-JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway, a functional blocking anti-Met antibody (R & D Systems), JAK inhibitor AG490, and STAT3 inhibitor peptide were utilized. DCP-induced STAT3 activation was reduced by 80, 108, and 58% by function-blocking anti-Met antibody, AG490, and STAT3 inhibitor peptide, respectively (Fig. 4B). DCP-induced incorporation of [3H]thymidine was also decreased by 113, 95, and 74% by function-blocking anti-Met antibody, AG490, and STAT3 inhibitor peptide, respectively (Fig. 4C). Gene Silencing Using Met siRNA and STAT3 siRNA Abrogates the Mitogenic Effect of DCP—To determine whether Met-STAT3 signaling pathway is a major signaling pathway for DCP-induced mitogenesis, HCC cells were treated with Met siRNA and STAT3 siRNA. Western blot analysis showed that Met protein expressions were reduced by 67% in Hep3B cells and 89% in SK-Hep-1. Lamin A/C mRNA remained constant in both cells (78 ± 13 and 88 ± 19% as ratio to no siRNA transfected cells for Hep3B and SK-Hep-1 cells, respectively). STAT3 siRNA inhibited STAT3 protein expression by 50% in Hep3B cells and 55% in SK-Hep-1 cells. Lamin A/C mRNA remained constant (86 ± 15 and 103 ± 24% as ratio to control siRNA transfected cells for Hep3B and SK-Hep-1 cells, respectively). DCP did not cause the phosphorylation of STAT3 in the Met-silenced Hep3B cells (data not shown). Met siRNA inhibited DCP-induced STAT3 luciferase activity by 67.4% in Hep3B cells and 91.4% in SK-Hep-1 cells (Fig. 5A). RNA interference gene silencing against STAT3 also abrogated DCP-induced luciferase activity in the STAT3-responsive element by 80.3% in Hep3B cells and 100% in SK-Hep-1 cells (Fig. 5A). When cell proliferative activities were analyzed by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, Met siRNA transfection decreased DCP-induced incorporation of [3H]thymidine by 39.3% in the Hep3B cell line and 66.6% in the SK-Hep-1 cell line (Fig. 5B). Moreover, STAT3 siRNA transfection decreased DCP-induced incorporation of [3H]thymidine by 56.8% in the Hep3B cell line and by 100% in the SK-Hep-1 cell line (Fig. 5B). DCP Did Not Affect the Raf-MEK ERK-MAPK Pathway— HCC cell lines were treated with DCP for the indicated period. Raf and ERK-MAPK phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot analysis. DCP did not phosphorylate either Raf (data not shown) or ERK-MAPK (Fig. 6). In addition, we performed luciferase reporter assays for Elk activation and found that DCP did not raise Elk-dependent luciferase activity in Hep3B cells (Fig. 6). We further investigated whether DCP stimulates the c-Myc and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by Western blot analysis. DCP did not affect the phosphorylation of c-Myc, p85-PI3K, and Akt (data not shown). Moreover, other Met signaling pathways were screened using an antibody array (MaxArray™ RTK Antibody Array) (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), which contains antibodies for proteins related to receptor tyrosine kinases. Other signaling pathways were not affected significantly by DCP (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with SK-Hep-1 cells (data not shown). In the current study, we present DCP as a novel autocrine/paracrine mitogen for HCC cell lines. Clinical studies show a significant correlation between serum DCP level and the clinical malignancy of HCC (11Shimada M. Takenaka K. Fujiwara Y. Gion T. Kajiyama K. Maeda T. Shirabe K. Sugimachi K.

Herein, DCP was demonstrated to stimulate the Met-JAK-STAT signaling pathway in HCC cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that clearly demonstrates a mitogenic effect of DCP in HCC cell lines. Proto-oncogene c-Met, which encodes the cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor for HGF, is overexpressed in a significant proportion of HCC cases as well as in other human cancers (19Brinkmann V.

Cancer Res. 1992; 83: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and extensive studies suggest that autologous Met activation causes cancer cell growth and invasion (42Hayashi S. Morishita R. Higaki J. Aoki M. Moriguchi A. Kida I. Yoshiki S. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

ERK-MAPK, STAT, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway are elicited by Met activation (45Comoglio P.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E161-E162Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Through ERK-MAPK, HGF stimulates proliferative activity of the HCC cells (46Lee K.H. Hyun M.S. Kim J.R. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2003; 20: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, some studies have shown that HGF has an inhibitory effect or no effect on HCC cell growth (47Shiota G. Rhoads D.B. Wang T.C. Nakamura T. Schmidt E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 48Tajima H. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In keeping with these studies, we found that HGF stimulated neither cell proliferation nor the ERK-MAPK signaling pathway (data not shown) in Hep3B and SK-Hep1 cells. Both DCP and HGF bound to Met and caused its autophosphorylation. HGF induced full phosphorylation of the Met autophosphorylation site, including Tyr1234/1235 and Try1349, whereas DCP only stimulated Tyr1234/1235. This partial phosphorylation may cause a different biological effect on cell proliferation. Although the biological response through a single receptor that binds to different ligands is usually indistinguishable, some receptors reportedly can discriminate between ligands and induce different biological responses (49Reddy C.C. Wells A. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 50Sweeney C. Lai C. Riese D.J. Diamonti A.J. Cantley L.C. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19803-19807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We found, however, that DCP did not activate the ERK-MAPK signaling pathway. Thus, further study is needed to elucidate ligand discrimination in the autophosphorylation and biological response of the Met receptor. In searching for the downstream signaling pathway of DCP, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway was found to be a promising candidate. A wide variety of extracellular signals activate the STAT class of transcription factors. Many cytokines, lymphokines, and growth factors signal through a related superfamily of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases that are associated with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. It was previously reported that HCC cell proliferation is activated by STAT3 signals (51Sanchez A. Nagy P. Thorgeirsson S.S. Eur. J. Cancer. 2003; 39: 2093-2098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and STAT3 activation has been reported in various cancer tissues (52Ni Z. Lou W. Lee S.O. Dhir R. DeMiguel F. Grandis J.R. Gao A.C. J. Urol. 2002; 167: 1859-1862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Song J.I. Grandis J.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2489-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The HBx protein from the hepatitis B virus (54Lee Y.H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25510-25515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and hepatitis C virus core protein may activate STAT3 (55Yoshida T. Hanada T. Tokuhisa T. Kosai K. Sata M. Kohara M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This is important because STAT3 signaling is generally considered to be involved in carcinogenesis and cancer development, including HCC. We also show in the present study that STAT3 played a major role in DCP-induced cell proliferation. Both prothrombin and HGF induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in Western blot analysis, but they did not activate STAT3-induced transcription or cell proliferation. This discrepancy may be caused by a Ser727-independent STAT3 regulatory mechanism. Although two phosphorylation sites (Tyr705 and Ser727) are reported to play a major role in STAT3 activation (56Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar, 57Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, 58Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 61Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2948-2956PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 is varied depending on the status of other cells (63Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Ng A.K. Chien W.W. Ng Y.P. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6728-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 64Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). RNA interference for STAT3 and STAT3 inhibitor peptide were utilized to confirm whether STAT3 was the key molecule in the DCP signaling pathway. Both STAT3 inhibitor peptide and siRNA against STAT3 abrogated DCP-induced cell proliferation as well as STAT3-induced transcription (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, the JAK1-STAT3-pathway is considered to be a major signaling pathway for DCP stimulation. Other Met-related signaling pathways were not affected by DCP stimulation. PI3K-Akt signaling is known to promote survival under apoptotic stress (65Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar), but DCP did not significantly affect this signaling pathway. Furthermore, neither the expression nor phosphorylation of c-Myc was affected by DCP stimulation. In the current study we demonstrate a novel autocrine/paracrine mechanism of DCP-positive HCC in vitro in which the DCP-Met-STAT3 signaling pathway becomes a capable therapeutic target to inhibit the development of HCC. Further in vivo studies are necessary to validate this mechanism. We thank Naoki Magario, Keisuke Watanabe and Toru Naraki (Eisai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for determination of DCP levels and DCP purification."

Previous studies suggested that the herbal extract curcumin might affect the processing of a common CF mutant, CFTR-ΔF508. Here, we tested the hypothesis that curcumin influences channel function. Curcumin increased CFTR channel activity in excised, inside-out membrane patches by reducing channel closed time and prolonging the time channels remained open. Stimulation was dose-dependent, reversible, and greater than that observed with genistein, another compound that stimulates CFTR. Curcumin-dependent stimulation required phosphorylated channels and the presence of ATP. We found that curcumin increased the activity of both wild-type and ΔF508 channels. Adding curcumin also increased Cl– transport in differentiated non-CF airway epithelia but not in CF epithelia. These results suggest that curcumin may directly stimulate CFTR Cl– channels.

Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5858) Google Scholar). The most common CF mutation (ΔF508) causes defective protein folding, and as a result CFTR is targeted for degradation rather than progressing to the cell membrane (2Welsh M.J. Ramsey B.W. Accurso F. Cutting G.R. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed.

Other CF-associated mutations disrupt CFTR function by a variety of mechanisms, including some that prevent normal biosynthesis or impair CFTR Cl– channel function in the cell membrane. Knowledge of how mutations disrupt function has encouraged development of compounds that correct CFTR-ΔF508 processing and/or stimulate CFTR activity for those channels in the cell membrane (3Lukacs G.L. Durie P.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1401-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This effort has been spurred on by the suggestion that even a fraction of normal CFTR activity may be enough to prevent disease; studies in non-CF humans and in mice bearing targeted alterations of the CFTR gene suggest that that 5–10% of wild-type CFTR levels may be sufficient to prevent lung disease in humans and intestinal disease in mice (4Chu C.S.

Two additional discoveries support the feasibility of a pharmacologic approach. First, although the Cl– channel activity of CFTR-ΔF508 and several other CF-associated mutants is reduced, they do retain significant Cl– channel activity (2Welsh M.J. Ramsey B.W. Accurso F. Cutting G.R. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed.

Second, defective processing of CFTR-ΔF508 can be partially corrected by reducing the incubation temperature or adding chemical chaperones (8Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 9Kopito R.R. Physiol.

Moreover, administering curcumin to mice homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation corrected the characteristic defect in voltage across the nasal epithelium, whereas nasal voltage was unaltered in null mice. Curcumin administration also improved weight gain in CFTR-ΔF508 animals. However, three more recent studies did not find an effect of curcumin on CFTR-ΔF508 processing (11Song Y. Sonawane N.D.

Commun. 2004; 325: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Given the potential value of agents that modify CFTR function and/or processing and given differences in the reported effects of curcumin, we asked if curcumin might stimulate CFTR Cl– channel activity. Earlier studies had suggested that a very small amount of CFTR-ΔF508 may reach the cell surface in mouse intestinal and airway epithelia (14van Doorninck J.H. French P.J. Verbeek E. Peters R.H. Morreau H. Bijman J. Scholte B.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4403-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 15French P.J. van Doorninck J.H. Peters R.H.P.C. Verbeek E. Ameen N.A.

Thus, an agent that stimulates CFTR-ΔF508 activity might increase Cl– transport independent of alterations in mutant protein processing. Likewise, if an agent produced even a small correction in CFTR-ΔF508 processing, then increasing its channel activity would further augment the physiologic consequences. Our interest in curcumin stimulation of CFTR was also piqued by the earlier suggestion (10Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glockner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L.

Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that curcumin stimulates the activity of wild-type and ΔF508 CFTR Cl– channels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Expression Systems—For patch clamp studies, wild-type and mutant CFTR were transiently expressed in HeLa cells using a hybrid vaccinia virus system as described previously (21Sheppard D.N. Ostedgaard L.S. Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 876-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For studies of CFTR phosphorylation, COS-7 cells were electroporated with pcDNA3-CFTR (22Ostedgaard L.S. Zeiher B. Welsh M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2091-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cultures of human airway epithelia were obtained from non-CF and CF bronchus (ΔF508/ΔF508) and cultured at the air-liquid interface as described previously (23Karp P.H. Moninger T. Weber S.P. Nesselhauf T.S. Launspach J. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. Wise C. Epithelial Cell Culture Protocols. 188. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 115-137Google Scholar). Epithelia were used at least 14 days after seeding when they were well differentiated with a surface consisting of ciliated cells, goblet cells, and other non-ciliated cells (23Karp P.H. Moninger T.

These differentiated epithelia retain the functional properties of airway epithelia including transepithelial electrolyte transport.Ussing Chamber Studies—Transepithelial current was measured as described previously (24Zabner J.

Cell. 1998; 2: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) using a submucosal solution that contained (in mm): 135 NaCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, 2.4 K2PO4, 0.6 KH2PO4, 5 dextrose, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4, and a mucosal solution that was the same except that NaCl was replaced by sodium gluconate to generate a transepithelial Cl– concentration gradient. After measuring base-line current, we sequentially added amiloride (10–4m), 4,4′-diisothiocyanotostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (10–4m), and the cAMP agonists forskolin (10–5m) plus 3-isobutyl-2-methylxanthine (10–4m) to the mucosal solution followed by submucosal bumetanide (10–4m).CFTR Phosphorylation—48 h after transfection, COS cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized for 1 h at 4°C with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 and proteinase inhibitors) (22Ostedgaard L.S. Zeiher B. Welsh M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2091-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble proteins were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. Proteins in soluble supernatant were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-CFTR antibodies (24-1 from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, and MM13-4 and M3A7 from Upstate Technologies, Charlottesville, VA). The antibody-protein complex was precipitated with protein A-agarose (Pierce). Immunoprecipitated CFTR was washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer containing detergent and once with lysis buffer without detergent. Pellets were then phosphorylated with 40 nm catalytic subunits of PKA (Promega, Madison, WI) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 μCi/mm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) plus the indicated concentrations of curcumin or the Me2SO vehicle control. Phosphorylation was stopped by dilution into 100× volume of lysis buffer and cAMP-dependent protein kinase peptide inhibitor (PKI) (10 μm) (Promega). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained, destained, dried, and exposed to phosphor screens (Amersham Biosciences). Radioactivity was quantitated using the ImageQuant program (Amersham Biosciences).Patch Clamp Studies—We studied excised, inside-out membrane patches using the methods described previously (25Berger A.L.

The pipette (extracellular) solution contained, in mm: 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 MgCl2, 5 CaCl2, 100 l-aspartic acid, and 10 Tricine, pH 7.3, with HCl. The bath (intracellular) solution contained 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 3 MgCl2, 1 CsEGTA, and 10 Tricine, pH 7.3, with HCl. Following patch excision, channels were activated with the catalytic subunit of PKA (80 units/ml) (Promega) and ATP. Holding voltage was –40 mV for macropatch experiments and –80 mV for single-channel experiments. Experiments were performed at 23–26 °C.An Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA) was used for voltage clamping and current recording, and the pCLAMP software package (version 8.1, Axon Instruments, Inc.) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Recordings were low pass Bessel-filtered at 10 kHz and stored using a digital tape recorder. Replayed recordings were low pass-filtered at 100 Hz using an 8-pole Bessel filter (Model 900, Frequency Devices, Inc., Haverhill, MA) and digitized at 250 Hz for macropatch recordings. Single-channel recordings were low pass-filtered at 700 Hz and digitized at 7 kHz. Single-channel analysis was performed as described previously (27Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

Events ≤ 15 ms in duration were ignored.Reagents—Curcumin was obtained from Sigma (catalog no. C7727, lot no. 093K0795) and Fluka Chemika (Seelze, Germany, product no. 28260, lot no. 453335/144203356); we obtained similar results with both. Curcumin was dissolved in Me2SO prior to use and added directly to experiments without intermediate dilution in aqueous buffers. As we began our patch clamp experiments with curcumin, we noticed that when a curcumin solution was placed in a plastic syringe reservoir and gravity fed through a 50-cm length of 0.58-mm diameter polyethylene tubing (Clay Adams® Intramedic), the color of the solution emerging was less yellow than the starting material. Absorbance spectra of the samples showed a peak at 418 nm, consistent with curcumin, and after perfusion through the tubing more than 70% of the peak disappeared. Therefore, we prepared curcumin and added it directly to the cells or chambers in all studies. We were not able to study concentrations > 50 μm because of poor solubility. For prolonged exposure, curcumin was dissolved in Me2SO, diluted into culture medium at 1:1000, and added to the submucosal surface for 3, 6, or 18 h.Data—Data are shown as means ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSCurcumin Stimulates CFTR in Excised Membrane Patches—To learn whether curcumin could stimulate CFTR, we added it to the cytosolic surface of excised, inside-out membrane patches containing many CFTR channels. We added curcumin dissolved in Me2SO directly to the cytosolic bath solution, because when we applied it through a perfusion system it adsorbed to the tubing, and we observed no effect on current (see “Experimental Procedures”). Curcumin stimulated a large, reversible increase in Cl– channel activity (Fig. 1A). Stimulation required the presence of ATP and only occurred in channels that had been phosphorylated by PKA (not shown).As the curcumin dose increased, the current response increased (Fig. 1B). Previous studies showed that highly phosphorylated channels (those studied in the presence of PKA) have an altered response to the channel activator genistein and to ATP concentration (29Wang F. Zeltwanger S. Yang I.C. Nairn A.C. Hwang T.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined the effect of curcumin on highly phosphorylated channels (i.e. in the presence of PKA). Adding curcumin after removing PKA stimulated current with an apparent EC50 of 9.1 ± 2.4 μm. Curcumin appeared more potent when added in the presence of PKA, EC50 2.2 ± 1.1 μm. However in highly phosphorylated channels, 50 μm curcumin stimulated less current than 10 μm (Fig. 1B).Curcumin Inhibits PKA Activity—Finding that 50 μm curcumin stimulated less current than 10 μm curcumin in highly phosphorylated channels raised the possibility that curcumin might inhibit channel activity. Such behavior was reported for genistein, which stimulated CFTR currents at low micromolar concentrations and inhibited currents at concentrations above 20 μm (29Wang F. Zeltwanger S. Yang I.C. Nairn A.C. Hwang T.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 31Lansdell K.A. Cai Z. Kidd J.F. Sheppard D.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 317-330Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Alternatively, curcumin might alter PKA activity. To test for a direct effect of curcumin on PKA, we asked whether it inhibited PKA phosphorylation of CFTR. We found that as the curcumin concentration increased, CFTR phosphorylation fell (Fig. 2). Curcumin has also been reported to inhibit protein kinase C activity (32Liu J.Y. Lin S.J. Lin J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The reduced PKA activity may explain, in part, the decreasing current in response to high curcumin concentrations in the presence of PKA. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that high curcumin concentrations have a small direct inhibitory effect on CFTR.Fig. 2Curcumin inhibits PKA phosphorylation of CFTR.A, immunoprecipitated CFTR phosphorylated with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of indicated concentrations of curcumin.

When we then excised membrane patches, we found that even though the amount of current was less than with wild-type channels, 10 μm curcumin stimulated current (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Curcumin stimulates CFTR-ΔF508 channels.A, example of effect of curcumin on current in a membrane patch containing multiple CFTR-ΔF508 channels.

Curcumin did not alter single-channel current amplitude.Fig. 4Effect of curcumin on single-channel properties of CFTR.A, example of single-channel tracing in the presence and absence of 10 μm curcumin.

Hjelte L. Roomans G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Therefore, we compared the effects of genistein and curcumin and found that 10 μm curcumin generated a greater current increase than 10 μm genistein (Fig. 5). To further explore the mechanism by which curcumin stimulates CFTR, we added curcumin and genistein together. Instead of additive effects, genistein reduced the magnitude of curcumin-stimulated current. These results suggest that the two compounds might have related binding sites.Fig. 5Comparison of effect of genistein and curcumin on CFTR currents.A, representative time course of current from an excised, inside-out patch containing multiple CFTR channels. Channels were phosphorylated with PKA and 0.5 mm ATP, and PKA was then removed before the beginning of the recording. Bars indicate presence of ATP, curcumin, and genistein.

Current stimulation by 0.6% Me2SO alone was –0.6 ± 4.2% (n = 12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Curcumin Acutely Increases Cl–Current in Differentiated Non-CF Airway Epithelia—To learn whether curcumin stimulates epithelial Cl– transport, we measured the transepithelial Cl– current across well differentiated human airway epithelia. As observed previously, cAMP agonists increased Cl– current in non-CF but not CF epithelia (Fig. 6, A and B). We found that curcumin slowly increased Cl– current in non-CF epithelia, but it failed to alter current in CF epithelia. These results are consistent with curcumin stimulation of CFTR. Ten μm curcumin had little effect (Fig. 6B), even though this concentration stimulated substantial activity in isolated CFTR Cl– channels (Fig. 1B). The difference may relate to different access to CFTR channels in the two systems, different levels of CFTR phosphorylation, variable adsorption, or other factors.Fig. 6Effect of curcumin on differentiated human airway epithelia.A, example of transepithelial current tracings from non-CF and CF airway epithelia.

Physiol. 1993; 265: L170-L177PubMed Google Scholar) that would allow curcumin to stimulate transepithelial Cl– current. We found that curcumin stimulated less current than cAMP agonists, and adding curcumin and cAMP agonists together generated no more current than cAMP agonists alone (Fig. 6C). We obtained similar results measuring bumetanide-sensitive current (Fig. 6C), which provides an assay of total CFTR-dependent transepithelial Cl– transport (23Karp P.H. Moninger T. Weber S.P. Nesselhauf T.S. Launspach J. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. Wise C. Epithelial Cell Culture Protocols. 188. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 115-137Google Scholar).We also tested the effect of more prolonged curcumin addition. Curcumin had little effect on Cl– current in non-CF epithelia (Fig. 7). CF epithelia (ΔF508/ΔF508) developed no bumetanide-sensitive current even after incubation with a range of curcumin concentrations and exposure for 3 and 6 h (not shown) or 18 h (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Effect of prolonged curcumin addition to differentiated airway epithelia. Data are change in bumetanide-inhibited transepithelial current in non-CF and CF (ΔF508/ΔF508) airways after 18 h of incubation with curcumin in basolateral medium.

We obtained similar results with 10 μm (n = 3) or 50 μm (n = 15) curcumin added to epithelia obtained from three different CF (ΔF508/ΔF508) individuals. In addition, curcumin added for 3–6 h did not induce a bumetanide-sensitive current (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn these studies, we focused on the acute response to curcumin and found that it stimulates CFTR Cl– channel activity. Stimulation was dose-dependent and reversible and occurred with both wild-type and ΔF508 channels. Curcumin also stimulated CFTR activity in differentiated human airway epithelia.Finding that curcumin stimulated CFTR in excised, inside-out membrane patches suggests that it might interact directly with CFTR. Although our data do not allow us to determine the molecular mechanism, they do provide some initial suggestions. We found that curcumin only stimulated phosphorylated CFTR, and its potency increased when applied to highly phosphorylated channels. Moreover, stimulation occurred at curcumin concentrations that partially inhibit PKA phosphorylation of CFTR. These results suggest that the primary mechanism probably does not directly involve the R domain (35Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol.

https://openalex.org/W2144197789,"Oncogenic activation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway is common in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Dishevelled (Dvl), a key activator of the pathway, inhibits the adenomatous polyposis coli complex, and this leads to the accumulation of β-catenin and promotes tumorigenesis. Recently, a novel inhibitor of Dishevelled, namely Dapper (Dpr), was isolated in Xenopus. To explore whether HDPR1, the human homologue of Dpr, has an anti-oncogenic role in hepatocarcinogenesis, we studied the expression of this gene in HCCs. We found that there were two alternatively spliced transcripts of HDPR1, designated as α and β forms, in human liver. Downregulation of the gene expression was observed in 31 (43%) of the 72 human HCC samples using the primer pair that amplified both transcripts. Furthermore, the HDPR1α was downregulated in 42 (58%) of 72 human HCCs and the downregulation significantly correlated with accumulation of β-catenin. Also, downregulation of HDPR1 by RNA interference in HLE cells led to cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin. Furthermore, a CpG island located at the promoter region and exon 1 of the HDPR1 gene was methylated in 22 (51%) of human HCCs. We showed that downregulation of HDPR1, in hepatoma cell lines, was associated with methylation of this CpG island using bisulfite sequencing and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine demethylation experiment. In addition to methylation-mediated downregulation of HDPR1, allelic loss (13–28% of informative cases) was detected using microsatellite markers flanking the HDPR1 locus. To conclude, downregulation of HDPR1 is common in HCCs, frequently involves hypermethylation of the promoter region, and allelic loss of the HDPR1 locus may also play a role."
https://openalex.org/W1491881129,"Type I interferon (IFN) enhances the transcription of the tumor suppressor gene p53. To elucidate the molecular mechanism mediating IFN-induced apoptosis, we analysed programmed cell death in response to type I (IFNalpha) or type II (IFNgamma) treatment in relation to p53 status. In two cell lines (MCF-7, SKNSH), IFNalpha, but not IFNgamma, enhanced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, only IFNalpha upregulated p53 as well as p53 target genes (Noxa, Mdm2 and CD95). The apoptotic response to IFNalpha decreased in the presence of ZB4, an anti-CD95 antibody, suggesting that CD95 is involved in this process. When p53 was inactivated by the E6 viral protein or the expression of a p53 mutant, IFNalpha-induced apoptosis and p53 target genes upregulation were abrogated. Altogether these results demonstrate that p53 plays a pivotal role in the IFNalpha-induced apoptotic response. IFNalpha-induced PML was unable to recruit p53 into nuclear bodies and its downregulation by siRNA did not alter CD95 expression. In contrast, IFNgamma-induced apoptosis is p53-independent. CD95 and IFN-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) are directly upregulated by this cytokine. Apoptotic response to IFNgamma is decreased in the presence of ZB4 and strongly diminished by IRF1 siRNA, implicating both CD95 and IRF1 in IFNgamma-induced apoptotic response. Taken together, these results show that in two different cell lines, IFNalpha and IFNgamma, induce p53-dependent -independent apoptosis, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1965709392,"Nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is responsible for sepsis-induced hypotension and plays a major contributory role in the ensuing multiorgan failure. The present study aimed to elucidate the role of endothelial NO in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced iNOS expression, in isolated rat aortic rings. Exposure to LPS (1 μg/ml, 5 h) resulted in a reversal of phenylephrine precontracted tone in aortic rings (70.7 ± 3.2%). This relaxation was associated with iNOS expression and NF-κB activation. Positive immunoreactivity for iNOS protein was localized in medial and adventitial layers of LPS-treated aortic rings. Removal of the endothelium rendered aortic rings resistant to LPS-induced relaxation (8.9 ± 4.5%). Western blotting of these rings demonstrated an absence of iNOS expression. However, treatment of endothelium-denuded rings with the NO donor, diethylamine-NONOate (0.1 μm), restored LPS-induced relaxation (61.6 ± 6.6%) and iNOS expression to levels comparable with arteries with intact endothelium. Blockade of endothelial NOS (eNOS) activation using geldanamycin and radicicol, inhibitors of heat shock protein 90, in endothelium-intact arteries suppressed both LPS-induced relaxation and LPS-induced iNOS expression (9.0 ± 8.0% and 2.0 ± 6.2%, respectively). Moreover, LPS treatment (12.5 mg/kg, intravenous, 15 h) of wild-type mice resulted in profound elevation of plasma [NOx] measurements that were reduced by ∼50% in eNOS knock-out animals. Furthermore, LPS-induced changes in vascular reactivity and iNOS expression evident in wild-type tissues were profoundly suppressed in tissues taken from eNOS knockout animals. Together, these data suggest that eNOS-derived NO, in part via activation of NF-κB, regulates iNOS-induction by LPS. This study provides the first demonstration of a proinflammatory role of vascular eNOS in sepsis. Nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is responsible for sepsis-induced hypotension and plays a major contributory role in the ensuing multiorgan failure. The present study aimed to elucidate the role of endothelial NO in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced iNOS expression, in isolated rat aortic rings. Exposure to LPS (1 μg/ml, 5 h) resulted in a reversal of phenylephrine precontracted tone in aortic rings (70.7 ± 3.2%). This relaxation was associated with iNOS expression and NF-κB activation. Positive immunoreactivity for iNOS protein was localized in medial and adventitial layers of LPS-treated aortic rings. Removal of the endothelium rendered aortic rings resistant to LPS-induced relaxation (8.9 ± 4.5%). Western blotting of these rings demonstrated an absence of iNOS expression. However, treatment of endothelium-denuded rings with the NO donor, diethylamine-NONOate (0.1 μm), restored LPS-induced relaxation (61.6 ± 6.6%) and iNOS expression to levels comparable with arteries with intact endothelium. Blockade of endothelial NOS (eNOS) activation using geldanamycin and radicicol, inhibitors of heat shock protein 90, in endothelium-intact arteries suppressed both LPS-induced relaxation and LPS-induced iNOS expression (9.0 ± 8.0% and 2.0 ± 6.2%, respectively). Moreover, LPS treatment (12.5 mg/kg, intravenous, 15 h) of wild-type mice resulted in profound elevation of plasma [NOx] measurements that were reduced by ∼50% in eNOS knock-out animals. Furthermore, LPS-induced changes in vascular reactivity and iNOS expression evident in wild-type tissues were profoundly suppressed in tissues taken from eNOS knockout animals. Together, these data suggest that eNOS-derived NO, in part via activation of NF-κB, regulates iNOS-induction by LPS. This study provides the first demonstration of a proinflammatory role of vascular eNOS in sepsis. Bacterial sepsis is a systemic inflammatory state characterized by vascular smooth muscle dysfunction, leading to hypotension, inadequate tissue perfusion, and multiple organ failure (1Hotchkiss R.S. Karl I.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (3203) Google Scholar). A key molecule believed to be responsible for several aspects of the septic condition is inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-derived 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; iNOS, inducible NOS; eNOS, endothelial NOS; Sper-NO, spermine-NONOate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF, nuclear factor; WT, wild type; KO, knock-out; GA, geldanamycin; RAD, radicicol; DETA-NO, diethylamine-NONOate; PE, phenylephrine; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; HSP90, heat shock protein 90; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; iNOS, inducible NOS; eNOS, endothelial NOS; Sper-NO, spermine-NONOate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF, nuclear factor; WT, wild type; KO, knock-out; GA, geldanamycin; RAD, radicicol; DETA-NO, diethylamine-NONOate; PE, phenylephrine; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; HSP90, heat shock protein 90; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. nitric oxide (NO). In response to systemic bacterial infection, iNOS is expressed in several diverse cell types, resulting in a high output of NO production. This high concentration of NO is thought to have dual functionality; i.e. it is protective in terms of its bactericidal actions in host defense (2Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar) but also conversely pathogenic in terms of contributing to some of the deleterious effects of endotoxemia. In particular, the impaired contractile function of smooth muscle and resultant decreased blood pressure have been attributed to increased NO-mediated dilatation, secondary to the induction and activity of iNOS (3Fleming I.

Physiol. 1990; 259: H1038-H1043PubMed Google Scholar), primarily in the smooth muscle and adventitial fibroblasts of the blood vessel wall (6Busse R. Mulsch A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Endotoxaemia-associated vascular iNOS expression is induced by a variety of cytokines, including interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an abundant glycolipid present on the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (for a review, see Ref. 7Kleinert H. Schwarz P.M. Forstermann U. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1343-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The molecular pathways involved in the regulation of iNOS expression occur largely at a transcriptional level and appear to be immensely heterogeneous, with particular mechanisms invoked in specific cell types (for a review, see Ref. 7Kleinert H. Schwarz P.M. Forstermann U. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1343-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, a common signaling molecule involved in these diverse pathways is the ubiquitous inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-κB. Activation of toll-like receptors directly by components of infectious organisms, such as LPS, will elevate NF-κB levels in vascular cells, as also will cytokines expressed in response to the microorganism, by binding to specific cytokine receptors (for a review, see Ref. 8Li X. Stark G.R. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 285-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). NF-κB then translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the promoter regions of various inflammatory genes including iNOS (9Sherman M.P. Aeberhard E.E. Wong V.Z. Griscavage J.M. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 10Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent reports have identified an autoregulatory role for NO mediated by regulation of NF-κB levels: at low concentrations of NO, NF-κB levels are raised, and conversely, at high NO concentrations, NF-κB levels and DNA binding activity are suppressed (11Connelly L. Palacios-Callender M. Ameixa C. Moncada S. Hobbs A.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3873-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 12Umansky V. Hehner S.P. Dumont A. Hofmann T.G. Schirrmacher V. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2276-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These studies, largely conducted using NO donors as the source of NO, indicate a dual nature of NO dependent on concentration and imply tight autoregulation by NO of its own expression. There is good evidence to support the thesis that high concentrations of NO produced consequent to iNOS induction suppress constitutive NOS activity i.e. endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS activity (13Buga G.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Ignarro L.J. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Indeed, our own recent studies, using iNOS knock-out mice, demonstrate that this autoregulation underlies the endothelial dysfunction evident in sepsis (14Chauhan S.D. Seggara G. Vo P.A. MacAllister R.J. Hobbs A.J. Ahluwalia A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 773-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, recent work using bone marrow-derived macrophages generated from eNOS knock-out and wild-type mice indicate a reciprocal relationship between eNOS-derived NO and NO produced by iNOS, such that constitutive low level NO production is essential for maximal iNOS expression in response to LPS in these cells (15Connelly L. Jacobs A.T. Palacios-Callender M. Moncada S. Hobbs A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26480-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Whether such a reciprocal interaction exists between vascular eNOS-derived NO and iNOS activity in terms of the vascular effects of NO in sepsis is unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether endothelial NO played a regulatory role on LPS-induced iNOS expression and function in rat isolated aortic rings, ex vivo, and in thoracic aortae from wild-type (WT) and eNOS knock-out (KO) mice, in vivo. Materials—All compounds used were obtained from Sigma except diethylamine-NONOate (DETA-NO), which was obtained from Cayman Chemical. Drugs were prepared using saline (0.9% w/v) except geldanamycin (GA), radicicol (RAD), wortmannin, and LY294002, which were dissolved in Me2SO and diluted with saline. Organ Bath Studies—All experiments were conducted according to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, UK. Rat Aortic Rings—Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) were killed by cervical dislocation. The thoracic aorta was removed and placed in cold physiological salt solution of composition (in mm): 119 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 25 NaHCO3, 1.2 KH2PO4, and 5.5 glucose. Aortae were cleaned of extraneous tissue, and rings were (2–3 mm) cut and mounted in 10-ml organ baths, under1gof tension, for online isometric tension recording using Chart™ v 4.2 software (ADI Instruments). Tissues were bathed in physiological salt solution maintained at 37 °C and bubbled with 5% CO2 in O2. Following a 45-min washing period, rings were subjected to repeated administration of phenylephrine (PE; 10 μm) until responses were reproducible. Following this, rings were precontracted with PE to an EC80, and the relaxant response to acetylcholine (10 μm) was measured to determine endothelial integrity; those vessels in which reversal of PE-induced tone was >50% were deemed endothelium-intact. In endothelium-denuded rings, tissues were deemed denuded if the relaxant response to acetylcholine was <10%. Arteries were then precontracted with PE to an EC80, by titration, and LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5; 1 μg/ml) was added to the organ baths. Thereafter, tissue tension was monitored for 5 h, and at the end of this time, tissues were collected, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C for biochemical analyses. To investigate the role of eNOS in LPS-induced relaxation and iNOS expression, some rings were pretreated with the NO donor DETA-NO (0.1–1 μm) and inhibitors of eNOS activation: the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors GA (10 μm) and RAD (1 μm) (16Whitesell L. Cook P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt inhibitors wortmannin (0.5 μm) and LY294002 (10 μm) (17Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar, 18Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). All drugs were administered 20 min prior to the addition of LPS. Since PE was titrated for precontraction, the level of precontraction between groups was maintained, irrespective of drug treatment. Murine Aortic Rings—Male (20–40 g) WT (C57BL/6J) and eNOS gene knock-out mice (19Huang P.L. Huang Z. Mashimo H. Bloch K.D. Moskowitz M.A. Bevan J.A. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar) that were bred in-house were pretreated with saline or LPS (12.5 mg/kg, intravenous, 15 h) prior to culling by cervical dislocation. The thoracic aortae were cleaned of surrounding fat and mounted in organ baths, as above, under a basal tension of 0.3 g. Rings were equilibrated with KCl (48 mm) as above, and endothelial integrity was determined in aortic rings of WT animals only. Following this, rings were precontracted with phenylephrine (to produce a level of contraction equivalent to 80% of the maximal response to KCl), and relaxation response curves to the NO donor spermine-NONOate (Sper-NO; 0.001–3 μm) were constructed. Western Blot Analysis—Aortic tissues from rat and mice were pulverized at -80 °C by using a stainless steel pestle and mortar and resuspended in homogenization buffer of composition (in mm): 0.1 PIPES, 5 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v), 20% glycerol (v/v), and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete®, Roche Applied Science). Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and assayed for total protein concentrations using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved by 7.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide minigels (Mini-Protean III, Bio-Rad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk (Marvel®) in buffer containing 10 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm NaCl, and Tween 20 (20% w/v) and incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal IgG raised against iNOS (sc-650) or eNOS (sc-654) antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Blots were exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:2000, Dako), and immunoreactivity was visualized using an ECL detection system (Cell Signaling Technology) and autoradiographic film. In some experiments, male (20–40 g) WT and eNOS gene knock-out mice were pretreated with LPS or saline and killed by cervical dislocation. The thoracic aortae were removed and stored at -80 °C until processed for Western blot analysis as described above. Plasma NO Measurement—Blood samples were collected by intracardiac puncture from saline- and LPS-(12.5 mg/kg, intravenous, 15 h) treated WT and eNOS KO animals. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the plasma was collected. Samples were analyzed for nitrite (NO2−) and nitrate (NO3−) using chemiluminescence as described previously (20Ignarro L.J. Fukuto J.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Byrns R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8103-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples and standards containing NO2− and NO3− were first reduced to NO, which was then quantified after reaction with ozone using a nitric oxide analyzer (NOA 280, Sievers). To determine total NO2− and NO3− concentrations, collectively termed “NOx,” samples were added to 0.1 m vanadium (III) chloride in 1 m hydrochloric acid refluxing at 90 °C under nitrogen. NO2− concentrations were determined by the addition of samples to 1.5% potassium iodide in glacial acetic acid under nitrogen at room temperature. Concentrations of NO3− were calculated by subtraction of NO2− from NOx. Immunocytochemistry—In some experiments, at the conclusion of the functional studies, rat aortic rings were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. The tissues were cryo-protected in 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C and mounted in optimal cutting temperature embedding medium at -70 °C (BDH Laboratory Supplies. Serial sections (8 μm) were cut and collected on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (BDH Laboratory Supplies) and blocked with 10% normal donkey serum. Immunostaining for iNOS protein was performed overnight using a polyclonal antibody raised against iNOS (1:200, sc-650, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized with TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:400, Jackson Stratech Scientific Ltd., Luton, UK). Sections were mounted in glycerol:phosphate-buffered saline (3:1) and viewed with a Leitz fluorescence microscope. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—NF-κB activation was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using protein extracts from rat aortic rings as described previously (21Lawrence T. Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay—Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T) cells (8 × 104 cells/well) were transiently transfected with pβIIx NF-κB-luciferase reporter vector and pCMV-Renilla luciferase control vector (1:50 ratio) to normalize for transfection efficiency (courtesy of Dr F. D'Acquisto for both vectors). The total vectors of 1 μg/well, prepared with an empty vector pcDNA3, were introduced into the cells using FuGENE® 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as per manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with DETA-NO (0.01–1 μm) for 5 h, and luciferase activities in cell extracts were measured using the Dual-Luciferase® assay system (Promega). The NF-κB-luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency against Renilla luciferase activity and expressed relative to DETA-NO untreated controls. Data Analyses—Aortic contraction is expressed as absolute tension in grams (g). LPS-induced relaxations are expressed as percentage of reversal of PE-induced tone. All data are shown as mean ± S.D. Densitometric analysis was performed on scanned images (Hewlett Packard) and analyzed using Scion Image (Scion Corp.). Tests of significance were conducted using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparisons for differences between data groups, where p < 0.05 was considered significant (GraphPad Prism 3). For comparison of concentration response curves, two-way ANOVA was used (GraphPad Prism 3). The n values indicate the number of experiments and animals used. LPS-induced Relaxation in Rat Aortic Rings—PE (EC80) produced sustained contraction of saline-treated endothelium-intact or -denuded rat aortic rings over a 5-h period (Figs. 1A and 2, A and B). In contrast, the addition of LPS induced a gradual and significant reversal of PE-precontracted tension over the same time period (Figs. 1B and 2A, p < 0.001). This response was dependent on the endothelium since endothelial denudation rendered aortic rings resistant to the vasorelaxant effects of LPS (Figs. 1C and 2B). However, treatment of endotheliumdenuded rings with the NO donor DETA-NO at 0.1 μm, a concentration that showed little or no vasorelaxant activity per se (Figs. 1E and 2B), restored LPS-induced relaxation (Figs. 1D and 2B, p < 0.001) to levels observed in endothelium-intact rings. Higher concentrations of the NO donor (1 μm) caused relaxation in endothelium-denuded rings per se (18.0 ± 5.1%, n = 8) that was not significantly different from the relaxation observed in the presence of LPS and, therefore, were not used in further experimentation since it was difficult to determine whether responses seen were due to DETA-NO directly or to LPS.Fig. 2Summary data of LPS (1 μg/ml, 5 h)-induced relaxation of phenylephrine-precontracted rat aortic rings.A, LPS-induced relaxation of rat aortic rings in the absence and presence of l-nitroarginine methyl ester (NME, 100 μm), inhibitors of HSP90, GA (10 μm), and radicicol (RAD, 1 μm) and inhibitors of PI3-K/Akt-dependent phosphorylation, wortmannin (WORT, 0.5 μm), and LY294002 (LY, 10 μm). B, restoration of LPS-induced relaxation in endothelium-denuded aortic rings by the NO donor, DETA-NO (0.1 μm), was unaffected by GA (10 μm) and RAD (1 μm). Values are mean ± S.D. (n = 10–31). Statistical significance is shown as p < 0.05 when compared with control (Cont;*) or LPS-treated (†) aortic rings using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In endothelium-intact rings, LPS-induced relaxation was blocked by the NOS inhibitor, l-nitroarginine methyl ester, and HSP90 inhibitors GA and RAD, whereas inhibitors of PI3-K/Akt, wortmannin, and LY294002 did not affect the relaxation (Fig. 2A, p < 0.001). However, in endothelium-denuded aortic rings, HSP90 inhibitors GA and RAD had no effect on the restoration of LPS-induced relaxation by DETA-NO (Fig. 2B, p < 0.001). Expression of iNOS Protein in LPS-treated Aortae—Expression of iNOS protein, as assessed by Western blotting, was evident in tissue homogenates of LPS-treated rat aortic rings with intact endothelium (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, no iNOS immunoreactivity was detected in LPS-treated endothelium-denuded rings (Fig. 3A) and nor in tissue homogenates of control (saline-treated) tissues with or without the endothelium (Fig. 3A). In homogenates of endothelium-denuded rings pretreated with DETA-NO (0.1 and 1 μm) and LPS, immunoreactivity for iNOS protein was restored (Fig. 3B). Treatment of tissues with DETA-NO alone produced no detectable iNOS protein (Fig. 3B). Similar to the functional response to LPS (Fig. 2A), HSP90 inhibitors GA and RAD profoundly suppressed iNOS protein expression (Fig. 3C). To further confirm the essential role of eNOS activity in the induction of iNOS protein, we assessed iNOS protein expression in eNOS KO and WT mice. In vivo administration of LPS (12.5 mg/kg, intravenous, 15 h) induced iNOS expression in aortae from WT mice but not in tissues of saline-treated animals (Fig. 4A). However, in comparison, the levels of iNOS expression in aortae of eNOS KO LPS-treated mice were significantly reduced to the extent that they were not significantly different from those observed in tissues of eNOS KO saline-treated animals (Fig. 4A, p < 0.01). Plasma NOX Measurements in LPS-treated eNOS KO Animals—Fig. 4B shows that LPS treatment of WT mice causes a profound increase in plasma NOx levels. This elevation in plasma NOx is significantly suppressed in LPS-treated eNOS KO mice. In accord with this difference in plasma [NO], LPS-induced changes in vasoactive responses to SPER-NO were likewise abrogated in tissues of eNOS KO when compared with WT animals. In aortic rings of WT animals, LPS treatment causes a small but significant rightward shift of the relaxation concentration-response curve to SPER-NO when compared with saline-treated WT mice (Fig. 4C). This shift was absent in rings taken from eNOS KO mice (Fig. 4D). NF-κB Activation in LPS-treated Rat Aortic Rings—In some experiments, DNA binding activity of NF-κB was measured in tissue homogenates from control and LPS-treated rat aortic rings by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. NF-κB activation was markedly higher in endothelium-intact, LPS-treated rings when compared with control tissues (Fig. 5, A and B). This DNA binding activity was severely reduced in endothelium-denuded rings either with or without LPS treatment (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, replacement of constitutive NO with the NO donor DETA-NO (0.1 μm) restored DNA binding activity of NF-κB in LPS-treated denuded rings to levels observed in LPS-treated endothelium-intact rings (Fig. 5A). At this concentration, DETA-NO had no significant effect on NF-κB activation (Fig. 5A). To demonstrate that NO-induced activation of NF-κB DNA binding led to transcriptional activity, HEK 293 cells transfected transiently with pβIIx NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid were stimulated with the NO donor DETA-NO (0.01–1 μm) for 5 h. Under these conditions, the luciferase activity was increased in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal increase of ∼2-fold at 1 μm DETA-NO (Fig. 5C). Localization of iNOS Expression in Rat Aortic Ring—At the conclusion of the vascular reactivity studies, expression of iNOS protein was also assessed by immunocytochemistry in cross-sections (8 μm thick) of rat aortic rings from control and LPS-treated rings. Positive immunoreactivity was observed predominantly in cross-sections from LPS-treated (1 μg/ml, 5 h) aortic rings (Fig. 6C) when compared with untreated rings (Fig. 6A). The staining was localized to the medial and adventitial layers, with moderate staining of the adventitial layer and no evidence of immunoreactivity in the endothelium (Fig. 6C, arrowheads). Immunoreactivity was totally absent from LPS-treated rings, where the antibody against iNOS had been omitted from the procedure (Fig. 6B). Using LPS, ex vivo, to mimic aspects of sepsis, herein we demonstrate that activation of constitutive eNOS activity is an essential prerequisite for efficient arterial expression and function of vascular iNOS. LPS induced a reversal of PE-precontracted, endothelium-intact rat thoracic aortic rings that was temporally associated with induction of iNOS protein in the walls of these arteries, specifically in the media and adventitia. In contrast, LPS treatment of endothelium-denuded rings did not relax precontracted tissues, and similarly, no expression of iNOS was detectable. Furthermore, in endothelium-intact tissues, inhibition of HSP90-dependent eNOS activity blocked both LPS-induced iNOS expression and vasorelaxation. However, in endothelium-denuded rings, HSP90 inhibitors affected neither the LPS-induced iNOS expression nor vasorelaxation. Together, these data demonstrate an implicit dependence of LPS-induced iNOS expression and vascular reactivity on the presence of functional endothelial eNOS. In addition, these observations intimate an essential, hitherto unknown, role of eNOS in the pathologic processes involved in the vascular response to LPS and highlight a novel pathway that might prove useful in the treatment of sepsis. Application of LPS to precontracted rat aortic rings produced a profound, near maximal, vasorelaxation of these tissues by 5 h that was associated with iNOS expression as assessed using Western blotting. In contrast, removal of the endothelium rendered aortic rings resistant to the vasorelaxant effects of LPS, and Western blotting analysis confirmed the absence of detectable iNOS expression. This absence of iNOS expression was not due simply to the possibility that, in endothelium-intact arteries, the endothelial cell is the site of LPS-induced iNOS expression since immunohistochemical analysis of these arteries clearly indicates LPS-induced iNOS expression in the adventitia and media only. This is in agreement with previous findings (22Kleschyov A.L. Muller B. Keravis T. Stoeckel M.E. Stoclet J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2743-H2751PubMed Google Scholar) in which vascular iNOS expression was found to be localized to the smooth muscle of the media and the fibroblasts of the adventitia. Together, the data suggest an essential role of the endothelium in facilitating the induction of iNOS and its vasoactive functions in endotoxemia. The endothelium dependence of this LPS response appeared to be related to provision of constitutive amounts of NO since administration of a concentration of DETA-NO (0.1 μm), which had little or no effect on vascular tone or iNOS expression over the 5-h incubation period, per se, resulted in a restoration of sensitivity to LPS with respect to both parameters. In these experiments, DETA-NO was administered prior to the precontraction of aortic rings, and the level of precontraction was set identical to that in endothelium-intact controls by titration of phenylephrine to give an EC80. Therefore, the vasorelaxant response in these arteries was not due simply to NO donor-induced relaxation. However, experiments with a 10-fold higher concentration of DETA-NO (1 μm) gave rise to a progressive drop in tone over 5 h in endothelium-denuded arteries in the absence of LPS, and therefore, this concentration was not used for studies with LPS. Since eNOS is the predominant isoform of NOS in the endothelium, we hypothesized that the dependence of LPS-induced iNOS expression and function on low level NO production related to basal and/or up-regulation of eNOS activity. The enzyme eNOS is constitutively active, however, it is now clear that its activity can be up-regulated by specific stimuli in essentially two distinct ways, either through protein-protein interactions or through protein phosphorylation. In particular, it is evident that phosphorylation of specific serine residues by the PI3-K/Akt (17Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M.

Inhibition of HSP90 by geldanamycin, a member of the benzoquinone ansamicyn antibiotic, which binds specifically to the unique ATP binding pocket of HSP90 in a stable and pharmacologically specific fashion (16Whitesell L.

In the present study, the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin suppressed LPS-induced reversal of precontraction of endothelium-intact aortic rings. Furthermore, in accord with this loss of function, LPS-induced iNOS expression was not detected in these aortic rings. This action of geldanamycin is unlikely to be due to a nonspecific action of the inhibitor since another structurally unrelated HSP90 inhibitor, radicicol (29Billecke S.S. Bender A.T. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J. Lowe E.R. Kamada Y. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20504-20509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), likewise blocked both LPS-induced relaxation and iNOS expression. Our findings with geldanamycin are in agreement with those of Joly et al. (30Joly G.A. Ayres M. Kilbourn R.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), who likewise demonstrated block of hyporeactivity of PE in rat aorta; however, this study suggested that this effect of geldanamycin was due to a direct action on iNOS, although iNOS protein expression was not analyzed. More recently, it has been demonstrated that HSP90 association with iNOS, as with eNOS, enhances activity of this enzyme in murine macrophages (31Yoshida M. Xia Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36953-36958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that a direct effect on iNOS accounts for the effects of the HSP90 inhibitors in this study since neither geldanamycin nor radicicol attenuated the DETA-NO-induced restoration of iNOS expression and thus LPS-induced relaxation (Fig. 2B). The reason for this difference is uncertain but may be related to the difference in cell type and warrants further investigation. In addition, a recent report suggested that HSP90 also complexes with soluble guanylate cyclase and serves as a stabilizer of the enzyme in bovine aortic endothelial cells (32Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Ju H. Harris M.B. Snead C. Jilling T. Dimitropoulou C. Maragoudakis M.E. Catravas J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H669-H678Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, in vascular preparations including rat aortic rings, it is unlikely that this is the mechanism of action since geldanamycin blocks acetylcholine-induced relaxation but not the relaxant effects of the NO donors sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin (25Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 33Shastry S. Joyner M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H232-H236Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of the main alternative mechanism for up-regulation of eNOS activity using wortmannin or LY294002, i.e. post-translational phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues by PI3 kinase, had no effect on LPS-induced iNOS expression in rat aorta. These results suggest that it is unlikely that eNOS phosphorylation was responsible for the increase in eNOS activity induced by LPS in the current study. That eNOS was the source of the NO responsible for the endothelium dependence was supported by studies using eNOS knock-out mice. At a time point associated with maximal LPS-induced NO production attributed to iNOS expression and activity in wild-type mice (14Chauhan S.D. Seggara G. Vo P.A. MacAllister R.J. Hobbs A.J. Ahluwalia A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 773-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 34Rees D.D. Monkhouse J.E. Cambridge D. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we demonstrated a profoundly suppressed expression of this NOS isoform in aorta of eNOS knockouts. This was accompanied by an associated attenuation in plasma NOx levels in LPS-treated eNOS KO animals when compared with WT animals. This suppression of iNOS expression and parallel decrease in NO production was associated with an absence of the changes in vasoactivity associated with LPS treatment in mice. In addition, we demonstrate that relaxation responses to NO donors in aortic rings that are suppressed in LPS-treated WT animals, as we have reported previously (14Chauhan S.D. Seggara G. Vo P.A. MacAllister R.J. Hobbs A.J. Ahluwalia A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 773-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), are unaffected in rings of eNOS KO animals. This depression in sensitivity of smooth muscle to NO is consistent with a down-regulation of soluble guanylate cyclase activity in the vascular smooth muscle (14Chauhan S.D. Seggara G. Vo P.A. MacAllister R.J. Hobbs A.J. Ahluwalia A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 773-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in response to iNOS-derived NO. The absence of this change in responses to SPER-NO, in tissues of eNOS KO mice, suggests that eNOS activation is an essential step in iNOS-induced repression of soluble guanylate cyclase activity. Thus, together our data support a facilitatory role for eNOS in LPS-induced iNOS expression and function. Although the precise signal transduction pathway for iNOS induction in endotoxemia remains to be established, it is now evident that interactions between LPS and its cellular receptor(s) lead to the activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB, resulting in the transcription of downstream elements, e.g. the gene encoding for iNOS (35Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Endotoxin Res. 2000; 6: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, suppression of NF-κB activation by calpain inhibitor I (inhibitor of the proteolysis of IκB) attenuates the circulatory failure, multiple organ dysfunction (liver and pancreatic dysfunction/injury, lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia), as well as induction of iNOS and COX-2 protein and activity in rats with endotoxic shock (36Ruetten H. Thiemermann C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, there is increasing evidence supporting the concept that NO, itself, induces NF-κB activation (for a review see Ref. 37Kroncke K.D. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), thus providing a self-perpetuating system that contributes to the progression of inflammatory reactions. In the present study, we observed that iNOS expression in LPS-treated endothelium-intact aortic rings was temporally associated with NF-κB activation. In endothelium-denuded rings, where there was no significant relaxation to LPS and a lack of iNOS expression, the level of NF-κB DNA binding was substantially less, and no differences were detected between LPS-treated and untreated rings, suggesting that eNOS-derived NO regulates the activation of NF-κB pathway. This thesis is supported by a reduced LPS-stimulated NF-κB activation and iNOS expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from eNOS KO animals when compared with WT cells (15Connelly L. Jacobs A.T. Palacios-Callender M. Moncada S. Hobbs A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26480-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the present study, substitution of constitutive NO with DETA-NO in denuded rings restored NF-κB activation to those levels observed in LPS-treated endothelium-intact aortic rings. Moreover, DETA-NO, per se, increased NF-κB-dependent reporter gene luciferase activity, thus lending support to our thesis that NO directly regulates NF-κB transactivational activity. Together, these data suggest that endothelium-derived NO modulates iNOS induction in the blood vessel wall by LPS, most likely by activation of the NF-κB pathway. In summary, our data demonstrate that in endotoxemia, maximal vascular iNOS expression and function are achieved via the up-regulation and activation of eNOS, and that in the absence of functional eNOS, the vascular effects of iNOS are delayed (Fig. 7). The findings from this study lend support to the growing numbers of reports demonstrating a regulatory role of NO in gene expression of inflammatory mediators. Moreover, our data provide the first demonstration of a proinflammatory role for eNOS in regulating vascular function in endotoxemia."
https://openalex.org/W2005518771,"Human WWOX gene encodes a proapoptotic WW domain-containing oxidoreductase WOX1 (also named WWOX, FOR2 or WWOXv1). Apoptotic and stress stimuli activate WOX1 via Tyr33 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. WOX1 possesses a tetrad NSYK motif in the C-terminal short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) domain, which may bind estrogen and androgen. Here, we determined that 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) activated WOX1, p53 and ERK in COS7 fibroblasts, primary lung epithelial cells, and androgen receptor (AR)-negative prostate DU145 cells, but not in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast MCF7 cells. Androgen also activated WOX1 in the AR-negative DU145 cells. These observations suggest that sex hormone-mediated Tyr33 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of WOX1 is independent of ER and AR. Stress stimuli increase physical binding of p53 with WOX1 in vivo. We determined here that E(2) increased the formation of p53/WOX1 complex and their nuclear translocation in COS7 cells; however, nuclear translocation of this complex could not occur in MCF7 cells. By immunohistochemistry, we determined that progression of prostate from normal to hyperplasia, cancerous and metastatic stages positively correlate with upregulation and activation of WOX1 and WOX2 (FOR1/WWOXv2). In contrast, breast cancer development to a premetastatic state is associated with upregulation and Tyr33 phosphorylation of cytosolic WOX1 and WOX2, followed by significant downregulation or absent expression during metastasis. These Tyr33-phosphorylated proteins are mostly located in the mitochondria without translocating to the nuclei, which is comparable to those findings in cultured breast cancer cells. Together, sex steroid hormone-induced activation of WOX1 and WOX2 is independent of ER and AR, and this activation positively correlates with cancerous progression of prostate and breast to a premetastatic state."
https://openalex.org/W2090843520,"The interaction of apolipoprotein E (apoE) with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans is an important step in the uptake of lipoprotein remnants by the liver. ApoE interacts predominantly with heparin through the N-terminal binding site spanning the residues around 136–150. In this work, surface plasmon resonance analysis was employed to investigate how amphipathic α-helix properties and basic residue organization in this region modulate binding of apoE to heparin. The apoE/heparin interaction involves a two-step process; apoE initially binds to heparin with fast association and dissociation rates, followed by a step exhibiting much slower kinetics. Circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance experiments using a disulfide-linked mutant, in which opening of the N-terminal helix bundle was prevented, demonstrated that there is no major secondary or tertiary structural change in apoE upon heparin binding. Mutations of Lys-146, a key residue for the heparin interaction, greatly reduced the favorable free energy of binding of the first step without affecting the second step, suggesting that electrostatic interaction is involved in the first binding step. Although lipid-free apoE2 tended to bind less than apoE3 and apoE4, there were no significant differences in rate and equilibrium constants of binding among the apoE isoforms in the lipidated state. Discoidal apoE3-phospholipid complexes using a substitution mutant (K143R/K146R) showed similar binding affinity to wild type apoE3, indicating that basic residue specificity is not required for the effective binding of apoE to heparin, unlike its binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor. In addition, disruption of the α-helix structure in the apoE heparin binding region led to an increased favorable free energy of binding in the second step, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions contribute to the second binding step. Based on these results, it seems that cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan localizes apoE-enriched remnant lipoproteins to the vicinity of receptors by fast association and dissociation.

It mediates hepatic clearance of remnant lipoproteins as a high affinity ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family, including LDLR, LDLR-related protein (LRP), and cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (5Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2173-2192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the liver, HSPGs act in concert with LRP to complete the interaction of remnant particles with LRP in a process known as the HSPG-LRP pathway, in which apoE initially interacts with HSPG on the cell surface and is then transferred to the LRP for internalization (6Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of apoE to interact with members of the LDLR family and with HSPG can also be significant for cell signaling events (7Swertfeger D.K. Hui D.Y. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D526-D535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of apoE to LRP activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and inhibits platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated migration of smooth muscle cells (8Zhu Y. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36257-36263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation by apoE is, on the other hand, mediated by its binding to HSPG (9Swertfeger D.K. Hui D.Y. J. Biol.

ApoE comprises a single polypeptide chain of 299 amino acid residues and contains two independently folded functional domains, a 22-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1–191) and a 10-kDa C-terminal domain (residues 222–299) (2Weisgraber K.H.

The N-terminal domain is folded into a four-helix bundle of amphipathic α-helices and contains the LDLR binding region (around residues 136–150 in helix 4) (14Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H.

In humans, apoE is a polymorphic protein with three major isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, each differing by cysteine and arginine at positions 112 and 158 (11Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2000; 1: 507-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). ApoE3, the most common form, contains cysteine and arginine at these positions, respectively, whereas apoE2 contains cysteine and apoE4 contains arginine at both sites. Both apoE3 and apoE4 bind with equally high affinity to the LDLR, but apoE2 has defective binding to the LDLR and is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (23Mahley R.W. Huang Y. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1933-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE4 is associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease and is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (3Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1485-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 24Davignon J. Gregg R.E. Sing C.F. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Strittmatter W.J. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4725-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). A cluster of arginine and lysine residues located on the polar face of the fourth amphipathic α-helix in the N-terminal bundle represents the binding site for cell-surface receptors (2Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the apparent accessibility of these basic residues, interaction of apoE with lipid is necessary for its high affinity binding to the LDLR (26Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that lipid binding induces opening of the helix bundle in the N-terminal domain (27Lu B. Morrow J.A.

Disruption of the amphipathic α-helix spanning residues 140–150 abolishes LDLR binding, indicating that this structural motif in apoE is critical for function (30Zaiou M. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M.

In contrast to binding to the LDLR, the stringency for binding of apoE to the LRP or HSPG appears to be less severe. Lipid association of apoE is not required for binding to the LRP (31Narita M.

ApoE2 that is highly defective in LDLR binding activity (<2% of normal apoE3 activity) has significant binding activity to LRP (40–50% of apoE3) (23Mahley R.W. Huang Y. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1933-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HSPG (50–90% of apoE3) (6Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The detailed molecular features that control high affinity binding of apoE to the LRP and HSPG are not yet defined fully. Previously, we have characterized the effect of point mutations of the basic residues present in the heparin binding sites on the equilibrium parameters defining interaction of apoE with heparin (22Saito H.

To predict the distribution of apoE to different receptors, such as LDLR, LRP, and HSPG, however, it is also important to establish the kinetics of apoE-receptor association and dissociation because receptor/ligand interactions at the cell surface do not occur at equilibrium. In this study, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were employed to determine the affinity and kinetics of the interaction of engineered apoE molecules in the lipid-free and lipidated states with heparin. Using this approach, we provide novel insights into the mechanism of apoE/heparin interaction.

Biotinylated heparin was dissolved in water and extensively dialyzed to remove any contaminating free biotin before use. Expression and Purification of Proteins—The full-length human apoE2, apoE3, apoE4 and their 22-kDa, 12-kDa, and 10-kDa fragments were expressed and purified as described previously (34Saito H.

All mutants of apoE were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA was ligated into a thioredoxin fusion expression vector pET32a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) and transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 star (DE3) (Invitrogen). The resulting thioredoxin-apoE fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (28Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For the apoE3 22-kDa (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) mutant that was expressed as insoluble protein, the proteins were solubilized from the cell pellet using 6 m urea (30Zaiou M. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M.

The apoE preparations were at least 95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE. In all experiments, the apoE sample was freshly dialyzed from 1% β-mercaptoethanol and 6 m guanidine HCl solution into Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) before use. The disulfide-linked apoE4 22-kDa mutant was dialyzed from 6 m guanidine HCl solution to maintain interhelical disulfide bonding (27Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). DMPC complexes with the apoE3 22-kDa variants were prepared as described previously (29Lund-Katz S. Zaiou M. Wehrli S. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34459-34464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SPR Measurements—Experiments were performed on Biacore-X and -2000 SPR instruments (Biacore, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). A streptavidin SA sensor chip was pretreated with three consecutive 5-μl injections of 50 mm NaOH in 1 m NaCl to remove nonspecifically bound contaminants. For immobilization of heparin on a SA chip, an injection of biotinylated heparin (10 μg/ml) in Tris buffer was made at a flow rate of 5 μl/min followed by a 10-μl injection of 2 m NaCl. Typically, 30–200 resonance units of heparin were immobilized, and the effects of mass transport were not significant because of the low surface density of ligand (35Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). An untreated flow cell was used as a control. For kinetic measurement of apoE interaction with heparin, a 30-μl injection of the apoE sample was passed over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. At the end of the sample plug, the same buffer was passed over the sensor surface to facilitate dissociation. After 3 min of dissociation time, the sensor surface was regenerated for the next sample using a 10-μl pulse of 2 m NaCl. The resultant sensorgrams were analyzed using BIAevaluation software (version 4.1). The response curves of various analyte concentrations were globally fitted to either the 1:1 Langmuir model or the two-state binding model described by the following equation (36Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar,37Lipschultz C.A. Li Y. Smith-Gill S. Methods. 2000; 20: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), A+B↔kd1ka1AB↔kdka2ABx(Eq. 1) where the equilibrium constants of each binding step are K1 = ka1/kd1 and K2 = ka2/kd2, and the overall equilibrium binding constant is calculated as KA = K1(1 + K2) and Kd = 1/KA. In this model, the analyte (A) binds to the ligand (B) to form an initial complex (AB) and then undergoes subsequent binding or conformational change to form a more stable complex (ABx). For the apoE 10- and 12-kDa fragments, binding responses in the steady-state region of the sensorgrams (Req) were also plotted against analyte concentration (C) to determine the overall equilibrium binding affinity. The data were subjected to nonlinear regression fitting according to the following equation, Req=CRmax/(C+Kd)(Eq. 2) where Rmax is the maximum binding response, and Kd is the dissociation constant. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—Far UV CD spectra were recorded from 195 to 250 nm at 25 °C using a Jasco J-820 spectropolarimeter. After dialyzing from 1% β-mercaptoethanol and 6 m guanidine HCl solution, the apoE sample was diluted to 25 μg/ml in Tris buffer (pH 7.4) to obtain the CD spectrum. For the apoE/heparin mixture sample, apoE was mixed with heparin (apoE:heparin ratios of 0.5–2 w/w) prior to the measurement. The results were corrected by subtracting the buffer base line or a blank sample containing an identical concentration of heparin. The α-helix content was calculated from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm, [θ]222, according to the following equation (38Morrisett J.D. David J.S. Pownall H.J. Gotto Jr., A.M. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar,39Acharya P. Segall M.L. Zaiou M. Morrow J. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Snow J. Biochim. Biophys.

Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the absorbance coefficient at 280 nm. Phospholipid concentrations were determined with an enzymatic assay kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Comparison of ApoE Binding to Immobilized Heparin and Heparin-Sepharose Gel—We have previously characterized the effects of point mutations of lysines in the N- and C-terminal heparin binding sites on the equilibrium binding to heparin using heparin-Sepharose gel (22Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Wehrli S. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14782-14787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, we made SPR measurements for the apoE/heparin interaction to examine the real-time binding kinetics. Fig. 1A shows sensorgrams of binding of apoE C-terminal fragments to the immobilized heparin on a sensor chip. Because binding equilibrium was achieved during the injection of the 10- and 12-kDa fragments of apoE, we determined binding isotherms from the relationship between the equilibrium binding response (Req) and protein concentration (Fig. 1B). These isotherms were similar to those obtained using heparin-Sepharose gel (Fig. 1C), and calculated Kd values from both methods were comparable (for example, Kd for the apoE 10-kDa fragment/heparin interaction are 29 and 76 μg/ml from Fig. 1, B and C, respectively); these results validate the SPR method for studies of the apoE/heparin interaction (41Osmond R.I. Kett W.C. Skett S.E. Coombe D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 310: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Kinetic Analysis of Heparin Binding to Full-length ApoE3 and Its 22- and 10-kDa Fragments—Fig. 2 shows a typical sensorgram for the binding of full-length apoE to heparin. The kinetic data were not fitted well by a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, as indicated by the large value of the goodness of fit (χ2 = 100) (Fig. 2, inset). However, significantly improved fit (χ2 = 7.4) was obtained using a two-state binding model, indicating that binding of apoE to heparin involves either a sequential two-step process or some conformational change (36Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 37Lipschultz C.A. Li Y. Smith-Gill S. Methods. 2000; 20: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The response curve of heparin binding of the apoE3 22-kDa fragment also showed two-state binding kinetics (Fig. 3A). Changing the injection time revealed that the dissociation rate was progressively decreased after longer injection (contact) time (Fig. 3A, inset), indicating that the stability of the initial apoE-heparin complex increases over time (36Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 37Lipschultz C.A. Li Y. Smith-Gill S. Methods. 2000; 20: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Such an effect of contact time on dissociation rate was not seen in the apoE 10-kDa binding to heparin, because the contribution of the second binding step to the overall process was very small (Fig. 3B). Table I summarizes the kinetic rate constants and the derived affinity constants for full-length apoE3 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments obtained using the two-state binding model. There was good agreement in the Kd values for full-length apoE3 between our data and a previous report (32Shuvaev V.V. Laffont I. Siest G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) but some discrepancy for the apoE3 22-kDa fragment (21Libeu C.P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Wehrli S. Hernaiz M.J. Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Raffai R.L. Newhouse Y.M. Zhou F. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39138-39144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), because all previous studies applied the 1:1 Langmuir binding model to the kinetic data. In addition, the Kd value for the 10-kDa fragment in Table I (15 μg/ml) is similar to that obtained by the steady-state analysis (29 μg/ml from Fig. 1B), further validating the two-state binding model.Fig. 3SPR sensorgrams of binding of apoE3 22-kDa (A) and 10-kDa (B) fragments (30 μg/ml) to heparin. The experimental binding data (•) were fitted with the two-state binding model. Each component was shown as initial complex (AB) and transferred complex (AB).

As shown in Fig. 4, no change in the spectra of the apoE 22-kDa fragment was observed in the absence or presence of heparin. The α-helix contents derived from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm were in the range of 47–49% up to a heparin: apoE weight ratio of 2 (Fig. 4, inset), indicating that there is no change in the secondary structure in apoE upon heparin binding. The four-helix bundle of the apoE 22-kDa fragment is known to open upon lipid binding (27Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To further confirm that any such conformational change in apoE is not involved in the two-state binding to heparin, we tested the heparin binding of the triple interhelical disulfide-linked apoE4 22-kDa mutant in which the opening of the four-helix bundle is completely restricted (27Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SPR sensorgrams of heparin binding of this mutant still exhibited two-state binding kinetics (data not shown), indicating that a conformational change, such as the opening of the helix bundle, was not involved in the two-state binding for the apoE/heparin interaction. Effects of Lysine Mutations in the Heparin Binding Sites of ApoE on the Binding Kinetics—To explore the molecular mechanism of the two-state heparin binding of apoE, we used mutants with substitutions at lysines 146 and 233; these residues are located in the N- and C-terminal heparin binding sites, respectively, and contribute to an ionic interaction with heparin (21Libeu C.P.

As shown in Fig. 5, large decreases in binding responses were observed with the apoE3 K146E mutant, whereas the apoE3 K233E mutant exhibited responses similar to the wild type (WT), consistent with the previous observations using heparin-Sepharose gel in which only Lys-146 plays a dominant role in heparin binding of full-length apoE (22Saito H.

https://openalex.org/W2111678165,"Theileria parasites infect and transform bovine lymphocytes, but host cell immortalization is reversible, as upon parasite death the lymphocytes rapidly die of apoptosis. Infection leads to a marked augmentation in the levels of lymphocyte c-Myc, and the parasite achieves this by inducing increased c-myc transcription and by prolonging the half-life of the transcription factor. Reduction in c-Myc turnover can be ascribed to CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor. A parasite-dependent GM-CSF autocrine loop activates a JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway that contributes to heightened c-myc transcription, and inhibition of the pathway leads to caspase 9 activation and apoptosis that can be directly ascribed to a reduction in c-Myc. An antiapoptotic role for c-Myc was clearly demonstrated by specific inhibition of c-myc expression with antisense oligonucleotides, and this correlates with loss of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, and, consistently, ectopic expression of c-Myc abrogates B-cell death induced upon JAK2 inhibition. Thus, Theileria parasites ensure the survival of their host lymphocytes via specific activation of c-Myc."

CaMKII displays calcium-dependent binding to proteins in vitro and translocation to synaptic sites after glutamatergic activity in neurons. We therefore hypothesized that subcellular targeting of CaMKII can direct its substrate specificity in an activity-dependent fashion. Here, we examined whether activity-dependent colocalization of CaMKII and its substrates could result in regulation of substrate phosphorylation in cells. We find that substrates localized at cellular membranes required CaMKII translocation to these compartments to achieve effective phosphorylation. Spatial barriers to phosphorylation could be overcome by translocation and anchoring to the substrate itself or to nearby target proteins within the membrane compartment. In contrast, phosphorylation of a cytoplasmic counterpart of the substrate does not require CaMKII translocation or stable protein-protein binding. Cytosolic phosphorylation is more permissive, exhibiting partial calcium-independence. Localization-dependent substrate specificity can also show more graded levels of regulation within signaling microdomains. We find that colocalization of translocated CaMKII and its substrate to lipid rafts in the plasma membrane can modulate the magnitude of phosphorylation. Thus, dynamic regulation of both substrate and kinase localization provides a powerful and nuanced way to regulate CaMKII signal specificity.

Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 473-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). CaMKII is required for long term potentiation at CA1 synapses as well as in behavioral learning and memory tasks (2Malinow R. Schulman H. Tsien R.W. Science. 1989; 245: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, 3Lledo P.M. Hjelmstad G.O. Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A number of the prominent CaMKII substrates are membrane proteins. CaMKII phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR), ryanodine receptor, and several ion channels regulate their conductance properties (5Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Thus, CaMKII has a wide repertoire of substrates and associated cellular functions, which raises the question of how CaMKII activity can discriminate among its many substrates. A possible point of regulation could be through the complex subcellular targeting of CaMKII. Several mechanisms of CaMKII subcellular targeting have been characterized as CaMKII splice variants and isoforms can contain targeting sequences such as a nuclear localization sequence and actin binding domains (8Srinivasan M. Edman C. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Shen K. Teruel M.N. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Neuron. 1998; 21: 593-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Membrane targeting can be mediated by assembly with proteins such as αCaMKII association protein (10Bayer K.U. Lohler J. Harbers K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 29-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, CaMKII has shown calcium/calmodulin-dependent interactions with membrane proteins such as the NMDA receptor 2B subunit (NR2B) that can affect its distribution in heterologous cells (11Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 12Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Activity-dependent CaMKII translocation in neurons has also been observed. Synaptic calcium influx through NMDA receptors in cultured, dissociated neurons and in vivo can cause rapid accumulation of CaMKII in post-synaptic sites (13Shen K. Teruel M.N. Connor J.H. Shenolikar S. Meyer T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Gleason M.R. Higashijima S. Dallman J. Liu K. Mandel G. Fetcho J.R. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 217-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, induction of long term potentiation results in increased post-synaptic density (PSD) association of autophosphorylated CaMKII that displays calcium-independent activity (15Strack S. Choi S. Lovinger D.M. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13467-13470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Disruptions in the synaptic localization of CaMKII have been correlated with behavioral defects in transgenic mice carrying mutated CaMKII or lacking local CaMKII synthesis in dendrites (16Elgersma Y.

Commun. 2002; 290: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and is consistent with CaMKII regulation of cellular processes such as dendritic spine remodeling and AMPAR exocytosis that span several subcellular compartments (19Fink C.C.

The significance of CaMKII targeting for substrate phosphorylation has not been fully examined. Targeting to selected subcellular domains is crucial for effective cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and MAPK signaling (21Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N.

Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation and subsequent regulation of L-type calcium channels by cAMP-dependent protein kinase requires expression of the appropriate cAMP-dependent protein kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79, and targeting of the kinase to the channel (21Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Although it is widely speculated that CaMKII translocation might result in similar signal specificity, this has not been directly tested. Furthermore, CaMKII is expressed at extremely high levels in the hippocampal neurons, estimated to be from 1 to 2% of total protein and is enriched in synaptic sites. Since the kinase is at such high concentration for a signaling protein, it is unclear whether dynamic localization would add much specificity since the kinase may be at saturating levels throughout such neurons. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that access to certain substrates requires a directed translocation of CaMKII. We first determined whether phosphorylation of a substrate requires subcellular targeting of both the kinase and its substrate in a heterologous cell system in which both substrate and kinase concentrations are high. We targeted CaMKII to selected subcellular compartments using the calcium-dependent interaction between CaMKII and the C-terminal domain of NR2B (12Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). We showed that CaMKII targeting is required for effective phosphorylation of plasma membrane and ER substrates. By contrast, a cytoplasmic substrate does not require anchoring of the kinase for phosphorylation to occur. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic compartment seemed more permissive for phosphorylation at basal calcium levels. We also found that lipid raft microdomains can influence the degree of phosphorylation when both kinase and substrate are targeted to the plasma membrane. These results characterize for the first time how colocalization of CaMKII and its substrates to various cellular compartments regulates substrate phosphorylation. Gene Construction—All Vim constructs (Fig. 1) were derived from a PRK-5 vector containing a Myc-tag-labeled vimentin head. To generate the construct Vim-CFP-F, the coding sequence for EGFP was replaced by CFP through NheI and BamHI sites in the construct EGFP-F containing the farnesylation sequence from c-Ha-Ras (Clontech) CFP-F was then subcloned into NheI and BamHI of the cVim vector. CFP contains the A206K mutation to prevent any dimerization between fluorophores (24Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). mNR2B-Vim was generated by PCR amplifying the Myc-tagged vimentin head sequence with ApaI sites at the 5′ ends of both sense and antisense primers. PCR products were subcloned into the ApaI site at 4613 of pRK5-NR2B. cNR2B-Vim was generated by PCR from mNR2B-Vim and subcloned into pRK5. cNR2B was similarly generated by PCR from pRK5-NR2B. lyn-cNR2B was generated by PCR from pRK5-NR2B with the palmitoylation signal sequence from Lyn kinase. Yellow fluorescent protein tagged (YFP-CaMKII) was generated by replacing EGFP with YFP containing the A206K mutation (24Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar) by PCR. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Stimulation Protocols—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine Plus™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after the transfection, the cells were preincubated for 10 min with HBSS, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, alone or 10 μm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD, Sigma) and stimulated with 10 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) and 2 mm calcium in the absence or presence of MβCD. Some were loaded with 5 μm BAPTA-AM (Molecular Probes) in HBSS-Hepes for 20 min prior to fixation and immunostain. For GluR1 phosphorylation experiments, cells were preincubated for 30 min in 5 μm bisindolyl-maleimide I (Calbiochem). Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblotting—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer for 10 min followed by treatment with –20 °C methanol for 10 min. They were then incubated with the phosphorylation-specific vimentin antibody MO82 (0.2 μg/ml) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% normal goat serum. The cells were also counterstained with a polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:300 to assess expression level of vimentin constructs. The immunoreactivities were visualized by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies and Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes), and the samples were examined under a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM-510). Images were quantitated on Metamorph by first producing a ratio image by dividing the phospho-vimentin image by the Myc image. All treatment ratio values were then normalized to control ratio values. Thresholding the Myc image to select for cells resulted in a mask that was then applied to the ratio image. For Vim-CFP-F experiments, intensity quantitation was complicated by the variable appearance of intracellular clusters of the Vim-CFP-F construct. Instead, the thresholded ratio image was blindly evaluated in a binary manner for the appearance of a visible plasma membrane ring of phospho-staining at least three times background levels. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (12Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-Myc antibody was used at 1:750, MO82 was used at 0.2 μg/ml, anti-αCaMKII was used at 1:10,000, anti-phospho-Ser-831 (Upstate Biotechnology) was used at 1:500, anti-GluR1 (Chemicon) was used at 1:1000, and anti-GFP (Molecular Probes) was used at 1:1000. Membranes were stripped between blots with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) as per the manufacturer's instructions. We developed an assay to monitor CaMKII activity in different subcellular compartments. We utilized a protein sequence derived from vimentin to selectively measure CaMKII activity in cells (25Inagaki N. Nishizawa M. Arimura N. Yamamoto H. Takeuchi Y. Miyamoto E. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein, the assembly of which is regulated by phosphorylation of several protein kinases at multiple sites. One of these sites, Ser-82, has been characterized as a substrate for CaMKII, but not other kinases, including CaMKI, CaMKIV, protein kinase C, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (25Inagaki N.

Takahashi T. Inagaki N. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Using an antibody against the phosphorylated form of Ser-82, ectopically expressed vimentin has proved to be a sensitive probe for CaMKII activity both in heterologous cells and in neurons (25Inagaki N.

By attaching an 88-amino-acid segment containing Ser-82 derived from the N terminus of the vimentin head to proteins with known subcellular distribution, we measured CaMKII activity in the vicinity of the fusion protein by immunocytochemistry against phospho-vimentin. CaMKII has been shown to bind to the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B in a calcium-dependent manner (11Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 12Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Such targeting of the kinase may facilitate modulation of AMPAR nearby at synaptic sites. We therefore designed a probe of CaMKII activity at membrane-targeted NMDA receptors. We inserted a Myc-tagged vimentin head fragment (1–97) at positions 1420–1421 of NR2B beyond a second CaMKII binding site, one that is not autophosphorylation-dependent (11Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 12Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). We expressed the mNR2B-Vim construct together with GFP-CaMKII in HEK293 cells and showed that upon a calcium stimulation induced by ionomycin treatment, GFP-CaMKII translocates to mNR2B-Vim (Fig. 2A, right panels). The pattern of mNR2B-Vim expression was consistent with previously reported ER membrane retention of wild-type NR2B in the absence of NR1 (Fig. 2A) (29Fukaya M. Kato A. Lovett C. Tonegawa S. Watanabe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4855-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We then examined Ser-82 phosphorylation of the vimentin tag on NR2B and found that it was phosphorylated in a robust and calcium-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, right panels, and 2B). Calcium-ionomycin stimulation causes both CaMKII activation and translocation to membrane-localized mNR2B-Vim. To determine whether CaMKII translocation is required for mNR2B-Vim phosphorylation, we utilized a CaMKII point mutant, CaMKII(I205K), that has been previously shown to be defective in binding NR2B in vitro and unable to translocate to NR2B in situ (Fig. 1A) (12Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) while retaining calcium-dependent activation and autophosphorylation (30Yang E. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26199-26208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). When GFP-CaMKII(I205K) is cotransfected with mNR2B-Vim, it has the same initial cytosolic distribution as with wild-type GFP-CaMKII (Fig. 3A, left panels). However, upon calcium-ionomycin stimulation, GFP-CaMKII(I205K) does not translocate to mNR2B-Vim, as reported previously (Fig. 3A, right panels) (12Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Although the kinase should be activated under this stimulation protocol, immunostain with the Ser-82 phospho-antibody reveals no significant mNR2B-Vim phosphorylation over background levels (Fig. 3A, right panels, and 3B). Similar results were obtained from immunoblot of transfected cell lysates (Supplementary Fig. 1). Taken together, these data demonstrate that translocation is necessary for phosphorylation of mNR2B-Vim. Is translocation required for mNR2B-Vim phosphorylation because the substrate is anchored to a membrane? To investigate CaMKII phosphorylation of an equivalent cytosolic substrate, we created a cytosol-targeted mNR2B-Vim substrate (cNR2B-Vim) by generating a truncated construct (residues 1120–1482) that lacks the membrane domain of NR2B but contains the CaMKII binding site and the vimentin tag (Fig. 1B). We cotransfected cells with cNR2B-Vim and GFP-CaMKII or GFP-I205K. Both wild-type and CaMKII (I205K) remained cytoplasmic in basal conditions and upon calcium-ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 4A,B). We compared cNR2B-Vim phosphorylation between wild-type and CaMKII (I205K) both with and without calcium-ionomycin stimulation and found them to be comparable (Fig. 4C). Since CaMKII (I205K) was equally competent in phosphorylating cNR2B-Vim, although it was unable to stably bind the NR2B tail, we conclude that unlike mNR2B-Vim, phosphorylation of cNR2B-Vim does not require CaMKII anchoring. Thus, when CaMKII and cNR2B-Vim are freely diffusible, phosphorylation does not require anchoring of the kinase to the substrate. Furthermore, these results indicate that the dependence of substrate phosphorylation on translocation demonstrated in Fig. 2 using the CaMKII (I205K) mutant is not due to an intrinsic inability of this mutant to recognize the vimentin substrate. These results suggest that CaMKII translocation can exert extremely tight regulation over substrate phosphorylation, provided that substrates are spatially restricted into subcellular compartments or less accessible conformations. Phosphorylation of CaMKII substrates in cytosolic and membrane compartments under unstimulated (basal) conditions appears to be differentially regulated. HEK293 cells have low endogenous expression of CaMKII, which results in a barely detectable amount of basal phosphorylation for cNR2B-Vim and no phosphorylation above background for mNR2B-Vim (Fig. 5A). Basal phosphorylation is dependent on CaMKII concentration because both were elevated upon coexpression of GFP-CaMKII (Fig. 5B). However, although both mNR2B-Vim and cNR2B-Vim basal phosphorylation is increased by coexpression of the kinase, the effect is far more dramatic for cNR2B-Vim (Fig. 5, B and D, middle). Basal phosphorylation of cNR2B-Vim in the cytosol is much higher than basal phosphorylation of the mNR2B-Vim at the membrane. To elucidate whether basal phosphorylation was entirely due to continued calcium activation of CaMKII or to calcium-independent CaMKII activity, we determined whether phosphorylation is sensitive to BAPTA-AM treatment, which should eliminate most of the free intracellular calcium. A significant portion of basal cNR2B-Vim phosphorylation was reduced when cells were pretreated for 20 min with 5 μm BAPTA-AM, but a significant fraction of the phosphorylation was BAPTA-resistant, perhaps due to a population of autophosphorylated CaMKII with calcium-independent activity (31Miller S.G. Patton B.L. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1988; 1: 593-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mNR2B-Vim phosphorylation did not display any sensitivity to BAPTA (Fig. 5, C and D, right), although it is possible that changes may have been obscured by the smaller magnitude of starting basal phosphorylation for this construct as compared with cNR2B-Vim. Similar results were obtained by the coexpression of vimentin constructs with GFP-CaMKII(I205K), suggesting that basal phosphorylation was not mediated by persistent activity due to CaMKII/NR2B anchoring (data not shown.) Taken together, these data indicated that the cytosolic compartment can be much more permissive than membrane compartments for submaximal calcium signaling. To further characterize the nature of localization-restricted phosphorylation, we investigated whether a docking interaction between kinase and substrate was required for membrane-delimited phosphorylation or whether mere compartmental co-localization is sufficient. To this end, we constructed a cyan fluorescent protein-tagged farnesylated, plasma membrane-targeted vimentin substrate (Vim-CFP-F) that is not expected to interact with CaMKII or NR2B (Fig. 1B). Indeed, coexpression of Vim-CFP-F and YFP-CaMKII did not result in plasma membrane CaMKII translocation (data not shown). Similarly, coexpression of Vim-CFP-F, YFP-CaMKII, and cNR2B did not allow for plasma membrane CaMKII translocation (Fig. 6A, bottom row). Thus, we could observe whether CaMKII translocated to the plasma membrane via binding interactions with a plasma membrane-targeted NR2B C-tail enhances phosphorylation of an independent plasma membrane substrate that is capable of lateral mobility in the membrane. We tagged a portion of the NR2B C-tail (residues 1120–1482) that had previously been shown to be sufficient to direct CaMKII subcellular localization (11Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) with an N-terminal palmitoylation signal from lyn kinase (lyn-cNR2B) to direct this construct to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). YFP-CaMKII was used instead of the GFP-CaMKII constructs in previous experiments to allow spectral distinction between YFP-labeled kinase and CFP-labeled vimentin substrate. In the unstimulated state, YFP-CaMKII is cytosolic, and there is little basal phosphorylation of Vim-CFP-F, as expected based on previous findings with mNR2B-Vim and a cytosolic CaMKII. With lyn-cNR2B coexpressed to provide a membrane-anchoring site for CaMKII and upon calcium stimulation, YFP-CaMKII translocates to the plasma membrane and phosphorylates Vim-CFP-F (Fig. 6A, top row). Phosphorylation of Vim-CFP-F required coexpression of a CaMKII plasma membrane-targeting construct as both CaMKII translocation and Vim-CFP-F phosphorylation were absent if cytosolic NR2B tail (cNR2B) were substituted for lyn-cNR2B (Fig. 6A, bottom row). Cells assessed as positive for the appearance of plasma membrane phosphorylation demonstrated a clear requirement for lyn-cNR2B (Fig. 6B, see “Experimental Procedures”). These data demonstrate that, as seen for the ER, the plasma membrane also displays a localization requirement for CaMKII substrate phosphorylation. Furthermore, simple colocalization of kinase and substrate to the membrane compartment is sufficient to fulfill localization restrictions placed by membrane localization; direct anchoring interactions of kinase on substrate are not required. These findings have implications for known plasma membrane substrates of CaMKII that do not exhibit direct anchoring to the kinase. In the post-synaptic membrane, one such example is the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1, which can be phosphorylated by CaMKII on Ser-831 (32Barria A. Derkach V. Soderling T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32727-32730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To investigate whether a similar translocation-dependent phosphorylation by CaMKII can occur on this natural substrate, we immunoblotted lysates of cells cotransfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-GluR1, GFP-CaMKII, and cNR2B, lyn-cNR2B, or full-length NR2B and probed for phosphorylation of Ser-831 after calcium-ionomycin stimulation. As Ser-831 is also phosphorylated by protein kinase C, cells were pretreated for 30 min with 5 μm protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I. Ser-831 phosphorylation was greatly enhanced if either lyn-cNR2B or NR2B was present but not with cNR2B (Supplemental Fig. 2). This suggests that translocation of CaMKII to a membrane anchor facilitates phosphorylation of membrane proteins, consistent with our vimentin reporter construct results. Within a subcellular compartment, signaling microdomains can further influence access of enzymes to their substrates. Lipid rafts have been found to play important roles in organizing signaling at the plasma membrane, through clustering or segregating signaling components (33Pi"

https://openalex.org/W2086302495,"Deregulated c-myc gene expression is associated with many human and animal cancers. Myc overexpression promotes the growth of blood and lymphatic vessels, which is due in part to induction of growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We determined that the P493-6 human B-cell line increases VEGF production 10-fold upon Myc overexpression. Myc overexpression in avian B cells similarly resulted in high level VEGF production. Real-time RT–PCR analyses showed that Myc did not alter the VEGF mRNA content of these cell lines, indicating that a post-transcriptional mechanism regulates VEGF production. VEGF mRNA translation was examined by RT–PCR analysis of monosome and polysome sucrose gradient fractions from Myc-on and Myc-off P493-6 cells. Myc increased VEGF mRNA translation initiation, as VEGF mRNA loading onto polysomes increased 14-fold in Myc-on cells, and the number of ribosomes loaded per VEGF mRNA increased threefold. This translational regulation is specific to VEGF mRNA, as total polysomes show the same sucrose gradient profile in Myc-on and Myc-off cells, with no change in the percent ribosomes in polysomes, or in the number of ribosomes per polysomal mRNA. Myc stimulates VEGF production by a rapamycin- and LY294002-sensitive pathway, which does not involve alteration of eIF4E activity."
https://openalex.org/W2160293376,"Pancreatic cancer is exceptionally aggressive with no long-term effective therapy. Current interventional approaches, including surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy, have done little to quell the mortality associated with this malignancy. Subtraction hybridization identified a cancer-specific apoptosis-inducing cytokine gene, melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24), with a broad range of selective antitumor activity in diverse cancers both in vitro and in vivo in nude mice and recently in patients with advanced carcinomas and melanomas. Unlike most neoplasms, pancreatic cancers display innate resistance to mda-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis, which correlates with a diminished capacity to convert mda-7/IL-24 mRNA into protein. We presently demonstrate that this translational block can be reversed by treatment with agents that elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Induction of apoptosis in vitro and suppression of tumorigenesis in vivo in nude mice are induced in pancreatic cancers, irrespective of the status of their K-ras gene, only when tumor cells simultaneously express mda-7/IL-24 and are treated with a ROS-inducer, such as arsenic trioxide (ARS), N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (HPR) or dithiophene (NSC656240 (NSC)). In pancreatic cancer cells constitutively expressing mda-7/IL-24 mRNA, a single treatment with arsenic trioxide, HPR or NSC656240 induces apoptosis, which correlates with production of MDA-7/IL-24 protein. The specificity of this action is documented by the ability of ROS inhibitors, including N-acetyl-L-cysteine and Tiron, to block this killing effect. Of potential clinical significance, similar treatment of normal cells does not elicit significant changes in growth nor does it induce apoptosis. Analysis of signal transduction changes in pancreatic carcinoma cells infected with Ad.mda-7 in combination with a ROS-inducer indicate that cell death correlates with modulation of discrete cassettes of multiple signaling pathways in a pancreatic cancer cell-specific manner, supporting global signaling dysregulation as a potential mediator of apoptosis induction. These findings suggest a promising combinatorial approach for safely promoting cell death in pancreatic tumors that provides a rational framework for developing a selective and effective therapy for this invariably fatal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2089032162,"There is a high degree of cross-talk between tyrosine phosphorylation and the serine/threonine phosphorylation signaling pathways. Here we show a physical and functional interaction between the classical protein kinase C isoform (cPKC), PKCα, and two major nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in platelets, Syk and Src. In the presence of the cPKC-selective inhibitor Gö6976, platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine release was abolished in response to co-activation of glycoproteins VI and Ib-IX-V by the snake venom alboaggregin A, whereas platelet aggregation was substantially inhibited. Of the two platelet cPKCs, PKCα but not PKCβ was activated, occurring in an Syk- and phospholipase C-dependent manner. Syk and PKCα associate in a stimulation-dependent manner, requiring Syk but not PKC activity. PKCα and Syk also co-translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane upon platelet activation, in a manner dependent upon the activities of both kinases. Although PKCα is phosphorylated on tyrosine downstream of Syk, we provide evidence against phosphorylation of Syk by PKCα, consistent with a lack of effect of PKCα inhibition on Syk activity. PKCα also associates with Src; although in contrast to interaction with Syk, PKCα activity is required for the association of these kinases but not the stimulation-induced translocation of Src to the cell membrane. Finally, the activity of Src is negatively regulated by PKC, as shown by potentiation of Src activity in the presence of the PKC inhibitors GF109203X or Gö6976. Therefore, there is a complex interplay between PKCα, Syk, and Src involving physical interaction, phosphorylation, translocation within the cell, and functional activity regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2045490175,"Supramaximal concentrations of cholecystokinin or its analogue caerulein have been shown to stimulate the proteolytic activation of zymogens within the pancreatic acinar cell and initiate acute pancreatitis. Previous studies suggest that a low pH compartment might be required for activation. To test this hypothesis, the effects of agents that modulate intracellular pH on caerulein-induced trypsin and chymotrypsin activation were studied. Pretreatment of pancreatic acini with the proto-ionophore monensin (10 μm) and the weak base chloroquine (40 μm) inhibited activation. Pre-incubation with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A also decreased activation in a concentration-dependent manner with 50% inhibition at ∼50 and 25 nm, respectively. Caerulein stimulation caused a time- and concentration-dependent translocation of soluble V-ATPase V1 subunits to a membrane fraction, a marker of V-ATPase activation. Carbachol also stimulated translocation at supramaximal concentrations. Elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ by thapsigargin was sufficient to induce translocation. Thus, stimulation of V-ATPase activity appears to be required for agonist-induced zymogen activation in the pancreatic acinar cell. Supramaximal concentrations of cholecystokinin or its analogue caerulein have been shown to stimulate the proteolytic activation of zymogens within the pancreatic acinar cell and initiate acute pancreatitis.

Thus, stimulation of V-ATPase activity appears to be required for agonist-induced zymogen activation in the pancreatic acinar cell. The premature activation of digestive zymogens in the pancreatic acinar cell plays a central role in the initiation of acute pancreatitis, but the mechanisms leading to activation remain unclear. Concentrations of cholecystokinin that are at least 10-fold greater than that generated by the physiologic response to a meal, a treatment known as hyperstimulation, cause zymogen activation and pancreatitis in vivo. Similarly, hyperstimulation of isolated pancreatic acini by cholecystokinin or its analogue caerulein causes zymogen activation in vitro (1Leach S.D. Modlin I.M. Scheele G.A. Gorelick F.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 2Saluja A. Saito I. Saluja M. Houlihan M.J. Powers R.E. Meldolesi J. Steer M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: G702-G710PubMed Google Scholar). Such activation appears to take place in unidentified membrane-bound organelles. Previous findings suggest that the generation of a low pH compartment in acinar cells is a feature of acute pancreatitis and may be required for zymogen activation. First, in both the caerulein hyperstimulation and the choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet models of acute pancreatitis, acidic vacuoles are generated within acinar cells (3Niederau C. Grendell J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 81: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Second, chloroquine, a weak base that non-selectively increases pH in acidic organelles, reduces the severity of pancreatitis in the caerulein hyperstimulation and choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet models of pancreatitis (4Leach S.D.

Third, both proposed mechanisms of zymogen activation, trypsinogen autoactivation and trypsinogen activation by the lysosomal protease cathepsin B, proceed optimally at an acidic pH (6Kukor Z.

Finally, chloroquine and monensin, agents that non-selectively increase intracellular pH, block the proteolytic conversion of procarboxypeptidase A1 to its active form in isolated acini following caerulein hyperstimulation (1Leach S.D. Modlin I.M. Scheele G.A. Gorelick F.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although these studies support a role for acidification in zymogen activation, they provide no information on the mechanism. Because vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) 1The abbreviation used is: V-ATPase, vacuolar ATPase.1The abbreviation used is: V-ATPase, vacuolar ATPase. acidifies many intracellular compartments, it is a candidate for generating the low pH compartment observed during pathologic zymogen activation in the acinar cell. Furthermore, the soluble A and E subunits have been localized to the apical region of the pancreatic acinar cell; at least some of this immunoreactivity is associated with zymogen granules (7Roussa E. Alper S. Thevenod F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). V-ATPase is a proton pump present in eukaryotic cells that establishes the acidic luminal pH (4.5–6.5) of organelles such as lysosomes, endosomes, and secretory granules (8Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat.

In contrast to F-ATPases, which function as ATP synthases, and P-ATPases, which function as cation exchangers, V-ATPases function exclusively as ATP-dependent proton pumps that transport protons from the cytosol into organelle lumina or the extracellular space. V-ATPases are multisubunit complexes composed of an integral membrane domain (Vo) and a soluble peripheral domain (V1). The soluble domain must assemble with the membrane-bound domain to activate the pump (10Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that caerulein stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells causes an increase in trypsin and chymotrypsin activity that is inhibited by agents that non-selectively increase intracellular pH, chloroquine, and monensin. Similarly, the specific V-ATPase inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A significantly inhibit this caerulein-induced zymogen activation. Caerulein also causes a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the fraction of a soluble V-ATPase subunit associated with membrane-bound organelles in vitro. Furthermore, the muscarinic agonist carbachol and the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ by thapsigargin also caused this V-ATPase translocation. The findings suggest that agonist stimulation results in the translocation of soluble V-ATPase subunits to membranes and the subsequent V-ATPase activation that is linked to the proteolytic activation of trypsin and chymotrypsin. Animals and Materials—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (80–120 g) were obtained from the Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA. Caerulein was obtained from Amersham Biosciences; all other chemicals and supplies were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Acinar Experimental Protocol—Acini were prepared as described previously and incubated at 37 °C (15Lu Z. Karne S. Kolodecik T. Gorelick F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G501-G507Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Acini were pretreated for 30 min with the following agents that modulate intracellular pH: monensin (10 μm in 2.47 mm MeOH), chloroquine (40 μm), bafilomycin A1, and concanamycin A (100 nm in 1% Me2SO). The concentration-dependent effects of bafilomycin (10–50 nm in 0.05% Me2SO) and concanamycin A (1–50 nm in 0.05% Me2SO) on activation were examined. Following pretreatments, acini were treated with caerulein (100 nm) or carbachol (1 mm) for 2–60 min unless stated otherwise. For investigation of the role of cytosolic Ca2+, acini were treated with thapsigargin (10 μm) in Me2SO. Enzymatic Activity Assays—Samples (acini with medium) were stored at –80 °C prior to assay. Trypsin and chymotrypsin activities were assayed using fluorescent enzyme substrates and a microtiter plate reader as described previously (15Lu Z. Karne S. Kolodecik T. Gorelick F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G501-G507Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were normalized to total amylase activity and expressed as relative fluorescence units per second per microgram of total amylase. Amylase activity in acinar homogenates was determined using the Phaebadas test kit (Pharmacia Diagnostic, Rochester, NY). Other Assays—Amylase secretion was expressed as percentage of amylase release following 60 min of caerulein treatment. To examine cell injury, lactate dehydrogenase secretion was assayed (Promega, Madison, WI) and expressed as percentage of release. Subcellular Fractionation and V-ATPase Detection—Assays for both trypsin and chymotrypsin activation were done prior to fractionation. If an increase in activation of >50% for trypsin or >200% for chymotrypsin was not seen for acini treated with caerulein (100 nm), the experiment was not used for studies examining V-ATPase translocation. For subcellular fractionation, acini were homogenized on ice in 300 μlof0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors (5 mm benzamidine and a protease inhibitor mixture, used as directed by Roche Diagnostics) and subjected to low speed centrifugation (500 g for 10 min at 4 °C) to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The resulting postnuclear supernatant was subjected to high speed centrifugation (288,000 × g for 10 min) at 4 °C in a Beckman Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge to form a cytosolic and particulate fraction. The fractions were diluted in SDS sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 70 °C, and then electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels at 125 V and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA) for immunoblot analysis. Membranes were incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibodies to the E subunit of V-ATPase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:200 (v/v) or with polyclonal rabbit antibodies to the E subunit or A subunit at a dilution of 1:1000 (v/v) (provided by Prof. Irene Schulz, Homburg, Germany and described in Ref. 7Roussa E. Alper S. Thevenod F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in a Western blocking reagent (5% Carnation milk powder (Nestle, Glendale, CA) and 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were then washed in Western blocking reagent and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:10000 (v/v) dilution in Western blocking reagent for 1 h. After washing, the V-ATPase protein was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Statistical Analysis—Data represent the means ± S.E. of independent experiments, with each experiment being performed in duplicate or triplicate. A paired Student's t test was used to determine significance. Effects of Subcellular pH Manipulation—Preincubation of isolated pancreatic acini with either monensin or chloroquine inhibited zymogen activation induced by caerulein hyperstimulation (Fig. 1). Lower levels of activation were also observed after physiologic caerulein stimulation (1 nm); this response was also inhibited by monensin and chloroquine (data not shown). To define the role of V-ATPase on zymogen activation, the effects of specific cell-permeant V-ATPase inhibitors were examined. V-ATPase Inhibitors Reduce Zymogen Activation in Vitro— In the nanomolar range, bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A are high affinity inhibitors of V-ATPases. In the micromolar range they inhibit P-type ATPases and ATP-binding cassette transporters (11Crider B.P. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17379-17381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Drose S. Altendorf K. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment with bafilomycin A1 (100 nm) or concanamycin A (100 nm) completely blocked caerulein-induced trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen activation in acini (Fig. 2). This inhibition by bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A was concentration-dependent and half-maximal at ∼50 and 25 nm, respectively. To exclude possible nonspecific or toxic effects of the inhibitors, the effects of these agents on acinar cell secretion and cell injury were examined. Bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A had no effect on caerulein-stimulated amylase secretion (Table I) and did not lead to an increase in lactate dehydrogenase release from acinar cells, a marker of cell injury (data not shown). To confirm that bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A were not inhibiting other classes of ATPase, the effects of P-ATPase inhibitors and ion exchangers on caerulein hyperstimulation-induced zymogen activation were examined. Isolated acini were pretreated with either the Na+-H+ exchange inhibitor amiloride, the Na+-K+ ATPase inhibitor ouabain, or the plasma membrane ATPase inhibitor vanadate. None of these compounds inhibited zymogen activation at 100 nm, the concentration at which V-ATPase inhibitors block hyperstimulatory caerulein-induced (100 nm) zymogen activation (Fig. 3). At high concentrations (10 μm), amiloride demonstrated a tendency to reduce zymogen activation.Table IVacuolar ATPase inhibitors do not affect amylase secretion from the acinar cellTreatmentPercent amylase secretionControl5 ± 1Caerulein (100 nm)18 ± 3Caerulein (100 nm) + bafilomycin A1 (100 nm)16 ± 2Caerulein (100 nm) + concanamycin A (100 nm)18 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Agonist Stimulation Causes Redistribution of Soluble V-ATPase Subunits—V-ATPase activity requires assembly of a soluble complex (V1) composed of six tightly associated cytosolic subunits with the membrane-bound domain (Vo). As an indirect measure of V-ATPase activation, we assayed the redistribution of V1 from the soluble fraction to membranes after caerulein stimulation. To detect the redistribution of the 31-kDa E protein in soluble V1 subunits to organelles, postnuclear supernatants from acini were separated by centrifugation (288,000 × g) into soluble and particular fractions and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Caerulein hyperstimulation (100 nm) causes a dramatic increase in the level of the membrane-associated V-ATPase E subunit (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with two different antibodies to the E subunit. Antibodies to the soluble 71-kDa A subunit detected a faintly labeled band that also redistributed to the particulate fraction after caerulein hyperstimulation (data not shown). Treatment of acini with supraphysiologic concentrations (1 mm) of the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, which causes the same zymogen activation as observed with caerulein (13Schmid S. Modlin I.M. Stoch A. Tang L. Rhee S. Nathanson M. Scheele G.A. Gorelick F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G734-G741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in a similar ∼4-fold increase in the level of the E subunit associated with membranes (Fig. 4A). Agonist-dependent zymogen activation requires an increase in intracellular Ca2+ within the acinar cell. Treatment of acini with thapsigargin, an agent that causes an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ by effecting its release from stores in the endoplasmic reticulum, also resulted in translocation of the E subunit. The magnitude of this effect was similar to that observed with caerulein (Fig. 4B). Because glucose has been reported to modulate the translocation of the V1 subunits to membranes in yeast, its effects were in examined in acini (14Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, E subunit translocation to membranes in response to caerulein hyperstimulation was the same in the presence or absence of glucose in the medium (data not shown). Translocation of the E subunit to membranes was concentration- and time-dependent (Figs. 5 and 6). Increasing concentrations of caerulein resulted in increased levels of the membrane-associated E subunit from ∼5 to10-fold after 15 min (Fig. 5B). This concentration-dependent response corresponds to that reported for caerulein-induced zymogen activation (1Leach S.D. Modlin I.M. Scheele G.A. Gorelick F.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 15Lu Z. Karne S. Kolodecik T. Gorelick F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G501-G507Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The E subunit rapidly translocated to membranes after caerulein hyperstimulation. Within 2 min of stimulation, the levels of the E subunit associated with membranes had increased slightly. After 10 min of caerulein hyperstimulation the levels of E subunit had doubled in the membrane fraction. Decreases in E subunit levels in the soluble fraction were often observed, but these changes exhibited much greater variability than those observed for its association with membranes (Fig. 6A). The levels of the E subunit associated with the membrane appeared to be maximal by 15 min and did not increase further after 1 h (not shown). Notably, translocation of the E-subunit (detected after 2 min) to membranes appears to precede zymogen activation (first detected at ∼10 min in our system) (1Leach S.D. Modlin I.M. Scheele G.A. Gorelick F.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 15Lu Z. Karne S. Kolodecik T. Gorelick F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G501-G507Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although pretreatment with the V-ATPase inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A decreased zymogen activation (Fig. 2), they had no effect on caerulein-induced E subunit translocation to membranes (Fig. 7).Fig. 6Caerulein stimulation causes a time-dependent translocation of soluble V-ATPase subunits to membranes in pancreatic acini.

Preliminary studies have suggested that this activation requires a low pH compartment (1Leach S.D. Modlin I.M. Scheele G.A. Gorelick F.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Niederau C. Grendell J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 81: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Leach S.D. Bilchik A.J. Karapetian O. Gorelick F.S. Modlin I.M. Pancreas. 1993; 8: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Other reports have suggested that this activation may occur in a compartment related to lysosomes and/or within the secretory pathway (16Hofbauer B. Saluja A.K. Lerch M.M. Bhagat L. Bhatia M. Lee H.S. Frossard J.L. Adler G. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G352-G362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Otani T. Chepilko S.M. Grendell J.H. Gorelick F.S. Am. J.

Because V-ATPases mediate the acidification of lysosomes, related organelles, and compartments within the secretory pathway, we examined their role in acinar cell zymogen activation. In this study, we show that agonist-induced zymogen activation is coupled to activation of a V-ATPase. Furthermore, we find that translocation of soluble V-ATPase subunits to membranes, an event that is essential for V-ATPase activation, can also be regulated by agonists. Several of our observations support the conclusion that V-ATPase has a causative role in zymogen activation. First, caerulein-induced activation of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen in vitro is decreased by the specific, cell-permeant V-ATPase inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A. Second, the concentration dependence of caerulein-induced zymogen activation corresponds to that observed for translocation of the V1 subunit to membranes. Finally, translocation of the V1 subunit to the membrane appears to precede zymogen activation. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that a low pH compartment generated by V-ATPase regulates zymogen activation. The assembly of the V1 complex on the membrane-bound V0 complex is one mechanism by which V-ATPase activity is regulated. Previous studies have found that free V1 and Vo domains may be in dynamic equilibrium with the fully assembled, enzymatically active V1Vo holoenzyme. The presence of both fully assembled and free inactive V1 domains in a bovine kidney cell line has been demonstrated (19Myers M. Forgac M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A similar equilibrium was observed in the pancreas in which a small fraction of the V1 domain is associated with membranes in the basal state. Although we found a direct relationship between V1 translocation to membranes and the concentration dependence of zymogen activation with cholecystokinin, additional studies are required to provide direct evidence of V1 and Vo interactions. Our studies suggest that elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ are sufficient to cause translocation of the V1 domain. However, whether these increases result in activation of the V-ATPase needs to be examined. In yeast, V-ATPase assembly has been linked to glucose metabolism. Glucose deprivation for 5 min results in reversible detachment of V1 domains from Vo domains (20Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose regulation of the assembly state of V-ATPase in yeast has been shown to be mediated by the RAVE complex, a heterotrimer of Rav1, Rav2, and Skp1 (10Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies we could not find a role for glucose in V1 translocation in the acinar cell (data not shown). There are a number of mechanisms that might couple zymogen activation to H+ conductance by the V-ATPase activity. First, V-ATPase-dependent acidification of vesicles containing digestive zymogens may provide optimal pH conditions for proteolytic zymogen activation. In that context, cathepsin B appears to have a role in mediating trypsinogen activation (21Halangk W. Lerch M.M. Brandt-Nedelev B. Roth W. Ruthenbuerger M. Reinheckel T. Domschke W. Lippert H. Peters C. Deussing J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 22Saluja A.K. Donovan E.A. Yamanaka K. Yamaguchi Y. Hofbauer B. Steer M.L. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 304-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that cathepsin B-mediated activation of human cationic trypsinogen exhibits a pH optimum of 4 and does not occur above pH 5.2 (6Kukor Z. Mayerle J. Kruger B. Toth M. Steed P.M. Halangk W. Lerch M.M. Sahin-Toth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21389-21396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Trypsinogen autoactivation is also favored in an acidic milieu. Second, activation of the V-ATPase might couple proton movement to other cell signals that regulate zymogen processing. For example, V-ATPase has been linked to the regulation of cytosolic calcium signaling, an essential mechanism of zymogen activation. Thus, V-ATPase might modulate levels of cytosolic calcium by modulating the refilling of intracellular calcium pools or release from lysosomes (23Camello C. Pariente J.A. Salido G.M. Camello P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 161-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Yamasaki M. Masgrau R. Morgan A.J. Churchill G.C. Patel S. Ashcroft S.J. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7234-7240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Alternately, V-ATPase might drive a H+-Ca2+ exchanger that causes the accumulation of Ca2+ in vacuoles containing zymogens (25Okorokov L.A. Silva F.E. Okorokova Facanha A.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Finally, V-ATPase might mediate a trafficking event that is critical for zymogen activation. In that context, V-ATPase has been shown to play an essential role in trans-SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex formation and vesicular fusion (26Muller O. Bayer M.J. Peters C. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mayer A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This occurs through an interaction of the V0 subunits and is independent of V1 assembly with V0. However, the sensitivity of the zymogen activation to V-ATPase inhibitors and its correlation with V1 translocation makes it unlikely that V0-mediated vesicular fusion is mediating activation. In summary, we demonstrate that at supramaximal concentrations, agonist-induced zymogen activation requires V-ATPase activity. Translocation of a V1 subunit to membrane-bound organelles, a marker of V-ATPase activation, was observed in an in vitro model of acute pancreatitis. We propose that V-ATPase-mediated acidification of zymogen-containing organelles stimulates pathologic zymogen activation in the pancreatic acinar cell."
https://openalex.org/W2103195220,"Polyketide biosynthesis involves the addition of subunits commonly derived from malonate or methylmalonate to a starter unit such as acetate. Type I polyketide synthases are multifunctional polypeptides that contain one or more modules, each of which normally contains all the enzymatic domains for a single round of extension and modification of the polyketide backbone. Acyl carrier proteins (ACP(s)) hold the extender unit to which the starter or growing chain is added. Normally there is one ACP for each ketosynthase module. However, there are an increasing number of known examples of tandemly repeated ACP domains, whose function is as yet unknown. For the doublet and triplet ACP domains in the biosynthetic pathway for the antibiotic mupirocin from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB10586 we have inactivated ACP domains by inframe deletion and amino acid substitution of the active site serine. By deletion analysis each individual ACP from a cluster can provide a basic but reduced activity for the pathway. In the doublet cluster, substitution analysis indicates that the pathway may follow two parallel routes, one via each of the ACPs, thus increasing overall pathway flow. In the triplet cluster, substitution in ACP5 blocked the pathway. Thus ACP5 appears to be arranged “in series” to ACP6 and ACP7. Thus although both the doublet and triplet clusters increase antibiotic production, the mechanisms by which they do this appear to be different and depend specifically on the biosynthetic stage involved. The function of some ACPs may be determined by their location in the protein rather than absolute enzymic activity.

The active site serine of the ACPs is joined to the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group by a phosphodiester linkage to form the holoenzyme ACP. Reaction intermediates are attached to the terminal thiol of the 4′-phosphopantetheine arm that swings between enzymes to perform its function (1Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan J.E.J. Micrbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), allowing interaction with almost every other enzyme in the pathway. ACPs are involved in fatty acid synthesis in all living organisms. They can also act as acyl donors in the biosynthesis of lipids (2Rock C. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), can carry membrane-derived oligosaccharides (3Tang L. Weissborn A. Kennedy E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3697-3705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and can be involved in the activation of RTX toxins in Gram-negative bacteria (4Issartel J.P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Nature. 1991; 351: 759-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Specialized ACPs may also act as signal factors in rhizobial nodulation (5Geiger O. Spaink H.P. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2872-2878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as substrates and carriers in the synthesis of lipoteichoic acid (6Heaton M.P. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 681-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and polyketide antibiotics (7Shen B. Summers R.G. Gramajo H. Bibb M.J. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3818-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyketides are assembled by successive condensations of small carboxylic acid derivatives catalyzed by enzymes called polyketide synthases (PKS), which are homologous to fatty acid synthases (8Staunton J. Weissman K.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 380-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). ACPs thioesterified at the phosphopantetheine cofactor with the chain extender unit are used to generate nucleophiles to be acted upon by PKSs during condensation reactions. There are basically three types of polyketide synthases, the multifunctional Type I modular systems, the discrete Type II iterative synthases (9Hopwood D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2465-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), and the Type III chalcone synthases, which consist of a single homodimeric enzyme working iteratively independent of ACPs (10Tropf S. Ka ̈rcher B. Schro ̈der G. Schro ̈der J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7922-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Programming exhibited by PKS can be modular, where each enzyme works just once in the biosynthetic process, and iterative, where the enzymes work many times. The iterative Type I system of fungi has a single large polypeptide with a set of active site domains as in Type I modular systems but working iteratively to produce the polyketide. Modular systems like erythromycin have a single ACP/module, one for each condensation cycle the growing polyketide chain undergoes before the completed chain is released, so that each ACP domain is used only once in the course of each biosynthetic cycle (11Donadio S. Staver M.J. McAlpine J.B. Swanson S.J. Katz L. Science. 1991; 252: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Most of the Type II systems in bacteria contain a single ACP that works iteratively with other PKS enzymes performing the dual function of receiving the chain extender unit before condensation and of holding the growing polyketide chain after each condensation to produce the polyketide (12Revill W.P. Leadlay P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4379-4385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Revill W. Bibb M. Hopwood D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5660-5667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the above generalizations about Type I PKS systems there are an increasing number of examples with tandem clusters of ACPs, for example in the naphthopyrone and sterigmatocystin PKS of Aspergillus nidulans (14Fujii I.

Gene duplication is commonly proposed as a way that new functions arise, the second stage being either silencing of one of the gene copies by deleterious/degenerative mutations yielding pseudogenes or development of a novel function by one of the gene copies. Recently, however, the idea of subfunctionalization has evolved, which proposes the idea of partitioning the tasks of the ancestral gene between the pair (17Lynch M. O'Hely M. Walsh B. Force A. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1789-1804PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of the reason for ACP domain duplication may not only shed light on the process of polyketide biosynthesis but may also provide more general insights. Two examples of tandemly repeated ACP clusters are found in the mupirocin biosynthetic gene cluster from Pseudomonas fluorescens, a Gram-negative soil-born bacterium (18El-Sayed A.K. Hothersall J. Cooper S.M. Stephens E. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Mupirocin or pseudomonic acid (PA) is an antibiotic that competitively inhibits isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase and prevents the incorporation of isoleucine into growing polypeptide chains (19Hughes J. Mellows G. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is used topically in the treatment of skin and burn wound infections or applied intranasally to control hospital outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20Lamb Y.J. J. Hosp. Infect. 1991; 19: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Rode H. de Wet P.M. Millar A.J. Cywes S. Lancet. 1991; 338: 578Abstract PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mupirocin is formed by the esterification of 9-hydroxynonanoic acid and monic acid (22Chain E.B. Mellows G. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1977; 1: 318-322Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Oxygen labeling experiments confirmed that this ester linkage is formed between separate C17 and C9 moieties (23Martin F.M. Simpson T.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1989; 1: 207-209Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ∼74-kb mupirocin biosynthetic cluster involved in mupirocin production was identified by transposon mutagenesis and reverse genetics (24Whatling C.A. Hodgson J.E. Martin K.R.B. Clarke N.J. Franklin C.H. Thomas C.M. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 973-982Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing (18El-Sayed A.K. Hothersall J. Cooper S.M. Stephens E. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) revealing six long open reading frames typical of Type I PKS proteins, which we named mupirocin multifunctional polypeptides (MmpA–MmpF) as well as 27 genes (mupA-mupZ and macpA-macpE) encoding discrete proteins, some of which are similar to Type II PKSs. Quorum sensing regulates the expression of genes in the mupirocin biosynthetic cluster, which was repressed during the exponential phase and maximal on entry into stationary phase (25El-Sayed A.K. Hothersall J. Thomas C.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2127-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Monic acid synthesis is predicted to involve six condensation reactions catalyzed by six modules the last of which contains a pair of tandem ACPs, whereas the region currently hypothesized to be linked to 9-hydroxynonanoic acid production has a tandem cluster of three ACPs (18El-Sayed A.K. Hothersall J. Cooper S.M. Stephens E. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Other characteristics unique to the mupirocin cluster are the absence of a loading domain, the apparent absence of AT domains apart from AT1 and AT2 of MmpIII, the unusual position of the thioesterase domain, and the presence of 16 acyl carrier domains (18El-Sayed A.K. Hothersall J. Cooper S.M. Stephens E. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In this paper we establish for the first time a phenotype for the tandem repetition of Type I ACPs. Although the results show that in both cases the pathway can continue if just one of the ACPs is present, the results are not consistent with all ACPs being equal. Bacterial Strains and Growth Media Used—P. fluorescens NCIMB10586 (24Whatling C.A. Hodgson J.E. Martin K.R.B. Clarke N.J. Franklin C.H. Thomas C.M. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 973-982Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) the producer of pseudomonic acid was used as the wild type strain for creating mutants. Escherichia coli DH5α (26Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8146) Google Scholar) was used for plasmid transformation and propagation, and strain S17-1 (27Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5611) Google Scholar) was used to mobilize suicide and expression plasmids into the wild type P. fluorescens NCIMB10586. Bacillus subtilis 1064 was used as the sensitive organism in the bioassays to detect the antibacterial activity of mupirocin produced by wild type as well as mutants if any were produced (24Whatling C.A. Hodgson J.E. Martin K.R.B. Clarke N.J. Franklin C.H. Thomas C.M. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 973-982Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). P. fluorescens NCIMB10586 was grown at 30 °C in L-broth/agar containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin or 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Mupirocin production medium containing 2.3 g/liter yeast extract, glucose 1.1 g/liter, Na2HPO4 2.6 g/liter, KH2PO4 2.4 g/liter, and (NH)2SO4 5.0/liter was used in preparing cultures for HPLC. DNA Isolation and Manipulation—Plasmid DNA was extracted using the alkaline SDS method (28Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9886) Google Scholar) or by Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification Systems (Promega). The digestion of DNA was carried out with appropriate restriction enzymes (MBI Fermentas). The PCR products were cloned into vectors using T4 DNA ligase (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Construction of Deletion Mutants Using Suicide Vector Strategy— The suicide vector pAKE604 containing the AmpR, KanR, lacZα, sacB as selectable markers with an oriT was used to construct the deletion mutants (18El-Sayed A.K. Hothersall J. Cooper S.M. Stephens E. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The general procedure involves designing two sets of primers with 5′-restriction sites to amplify 500 bp-flanking regions on either side of the gene to be deleted by PCR and ligating them. The ∼1-kb insert was introduced into pAKE604 and E. coli S17-1 was transformed to mobilize the plasmid into P. fluorescens. Point mutations in mACP3, mACP4, mACP5, and mACP7 were constructed by replacing the active site codon TCG encoding serine in the wild type by GCC encoding alanine in one of the primers, and a restriction site was introduced by altering the third codon without changing the amino acid it encodes. The suicide derivatives of pAKE604 constructed in this way were transferred from E. coli S17-1 into wild type P. fluorescens NCIMB10586. Both of the strains were mixed and filtered through 0.45 μm sterile Millipore filters, which were then placed on L-agar plates to allow conjugation. P. fluorescens with the suicide plasmid integrated into the chromosome was then selected on M9 minimal medium with kanamycin. Medium containing 5% (w/v) sucrose was subsequently used to select strains in which the suicide plasmid had been excised from the chromosome. Screening for sensitivity to kanamycin identified bacteria where excision of the suicide plasmid had occurred. DNA Sequencing—Automated sequencing of the plasmid DNA was carried out by ABI Prism BigDye V3 Terminator ready reaction kit (PE-ABI), which has ampliTaq DNA polymerase, dye terminators, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, magnesium chloride, and buffer premixed into a single tube of Ready Reaction Mix and is based on the chain termination method of Sanger et al. (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4563-4567Crossref Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). The sequencing reaction was performed on ABI 3700 DNA analyzer (Genomics facility, University of Birmingham). Bioassay—Single colonies of P. fluorescens NCIMB10586 wild type/mutants were inoculated into L-broth containing ampicillin and incubated overnight at 30 °C. After normalizing the optical density measured at 600 nm, cultures were spotted onto L-agar plates and incubated at room temperature for 18–24 h. These plates were overlaid with a mixture of L-agar, B. subtilis culture (strain 1064 grown at 37 °C to late log phase), and 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (0.025%) as an indicator and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The zone of clearance around the spot culture was taken as an estimate of the amount of mupirocin produced. Culture Conditions for Isolation of Compounds—To obtain the seed culture a loop full of wild type and mutant cultures of P. fluorescens NCIMB10586 were inoculated into 25 ml of L-broth in 250-ml conical flasks and were shaken at 25 °C for 24 h. Five ml of the seed culture was inoculated into 25 ml of mupirocin production media and shaken at 22 °C for 20–60 h. The cultures were collected at different times, and bacteria were removed by centrifugation at 25 °C. The supernatant was used for HPLC analysis. Before injection the samples were filtered through 0.2 μm Acrodisc Nylon filters (Gelman Laboratory-Fischer). Analysis of Compounds by Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography—HPLC analysis was carried out to compare product profiles of the wild type P. fluorescens NCIMB10586 and mutant derivatives. HPLC (Gilson) with UV detector was used at a sensitivity of 0.002 absorbance units full scale and a wavelength of 233 nm. The DiscoveryR C-18 silica column (Supelco) used had a pore size of 5 μm. The solvents used were HPLC-grade water (Fischer) and HPLC-grade 100% acetonitrile (Fischer). Trifluoroacetic acid was added to adjust the pH of the mobile phase. A 70% acetonitrile gradient was used to elute mupirocin and the intermediates at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Amino Acid Sequence Similarities between Doublet and Triplet ACPs—For all the doublet and triplet ACPs, the active site serine residue lies in the highly conserved DSV motif characteristic of acyl carrier proteins (Fig. 2). The modular mACPs contain almost equal numbers (∼90) of amino acids, but show a high degree of sequence divergence (19–42% sequence identity), ruling out very recent gene duplication. Pairwise alignments (Fig. 2B) showed that mACP3 and mACP4 are more related to each other (40% identical) than to mACP5/6/7. Within the triplet, mACP5 and mACP7 (42% identical) are more closely related, but mACP5, mACP6, and mACP7 as a group are more closely related to each other than to mACP3/4. The similarity/identity is consistent with the mean similarity observed between tandemly duplicated genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (25–30%) (31Coissac E. Maillier E. Netter P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1997; 14: 1062-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The tandem ACPs can, therefore, be described as paralogous genes and might have diverged in sequence after ancient tandem duplication events. We were not able to identify any heterologous ACPs more closely related, which might have supported the idea of recent acquisition from an alternative source. Thus the closest identified relative of mACP3 is mACP4 and therefore they might have originated by gene duplication. A similar situation is found with mACP5 and mACP7, whereas mACP6, which seems to have originated from a different ancestor, might have been inserted between the two other mACPs of the triplet by a random recombination process. Alternatively it could be that mACP6 and mACP5/7 are the result of an initial duplication with mACP5/7 resulting from a later duplication. Construction of Mutants of the Putative Acyl Carrier Proteins—The mACPs in this study are part of multifunctional megaproteins and so it was important to achieve inactivation without affecting the other functions in the protein. Initial analysis was therefore by in-frame deletions. These deletions were constructed in the suicide plasmid pAKE604 individually and introduced into P. fluorescens NCIMB10586 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the mmpA and mmpB genes appear to be part of a larger polycistronic transcriptional unit, all deletion mutations were constructed in-frame to remove only specific runs of amino acids and avoid polar effects on the transcription of the downstream genes. Within the Mmp proteins the spacer regions between domains are usually 100 residues long, but mACP3 and mACP4 are separated by 12 amino acids, whereas mACP5 and mACP6 and mACP6 and mACP7 are separated by only 3 amino acids in both cases. The double and triple mutants were constructed by deleting completely the mACP doublet and mACP triplet including the spacer regions between these domains, respectively, from the mupirocin cluster. The single/individual deletions were made in such a manner that the spacer regions between the individual domains of an Mmp were retained to allow correct three-dimensional folding and orientation of domains of the polypeptide. The most complicated construction was that removing mACP7 from the mutant lacking mACP5, so as to leave mACP6 intact. Point mutations were also constructed by replacing the active site serine of tandem mACPs with an alanine, so as not to alter the natural folding of the polypeptide. The mutations were checked by PCR amplification and confirmed by sequencing. Qualitative Analysis of Mutants by Bioassay—To compare the antibacterial activity possessed by the wild type and mutant strains, a bioassay was performed using B. subtilis 1064 as the test organism. Indicator plates containing 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, which acts as a terminal electron acceptor and turns red when bacteria are actively growing, were used to estimate the zone of inhibition produced around the spot culture of wild type P. fluorescens (Fig. 3A). By contrast, the Δmacp3/4 double domain deletion mutant phenotype was indistinguishable from that of the mupI mutant (lacking the quorum regulation autoinducer needed to switch on mup expression in stationary phase) that is used as a negative control to demonstrate the loss of antibiotic production. The zones of inhibition of the individual Δmacp3, Δmacp4, Δmacp5, Δmacp6, and Δmacp7 mutants were comparable with or only slightly smaller than that of wild type P. fluorescens, whereas the Δmacp5/6/7 once again was similar to the negative mupI mutant (Fig. 3, B and C). Pairwise deletions constructed within the mACP triplet cluster (Δmacp5/6, Δmacp6/7, Δmacp5/7) did not abolish mupirocin production, but there was a significant decrease in the area of the zone of inhibition (Fig. 3C). The conclusion from this is that any one of the doublet and the triplet ACPs is sufficient for the formation of the polyketide chain but that reduction of the triplet cluster to a single mACP does have a quantitative effect on production. Quantitative Analysis of Compounds Produced by Wild Type and Mutants—The compounds secreted into the supernatant of the wild type and mutant cultures were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC with an acetonitrile-water gradient elution on a silica column (Fig. 4). The system was calibrated with known amounts of mupirocin standard as described under “Experimental Procedures.” P. fluorescens produces a mixture of PAs (Fig. 1). Mupirocin, which is PA-A, elutes between 20 and 21 min and is seen as a single discrete peak on the chromatogram. The peak at ∼19.5 min is predicted to be PA-B, and there are additional minor peaks seen after PA-A, which might be PA-C and PA-D, the other minor constituents of the antibiotic pool. All the single and pairwise deletions that retained antibacterial activity showed the same peaks as the wild type, whereas the double and the triple mutants (Δmacp3/4, Δmacp5/6/7), no longer produced any of the same compounds (as shown in Fig. 4). The time course of mupirocin production by the wild type strain was established by analyzing the samples collected between 16 and 64 h. Mupirocin production reached a plateau after 18 h, and the level then remained more or less constant until 64 h. The variables were reduced to a minimum while performing the quantitative analysis of mutants by equalizing the optical density of the seed cultures and maintaining similar culture conditions. The average area under the PA-A peaks of two clones of wild type and each mutant was taken at each time point. Production from the mutant cultures between 18–64 h was also analyzed and found to follow the same kinetics as seen for the wild type, reaching a plateau at ∼18 h. The area under the PA-A peak was used as an estimate of the amount of antibiotic produced. As the peak areas were more or less constant once the plateau was reached, all of the peak areas were pooled to maximize the statistical significance of the results. With the doublet mACPs in MmpA the deletion of either mACP3 and mACP4 had a similar effect. The Δmacp3 and Δmacp4 mutant strains produced 0.68 ± 0.03 and 0.62 ± 0.07 of the PA-A level of the wild type, the reduction being highly significant (p ≪ 0.001) (Fig. 5A). With the triplet mACP cluster in MmpB the Δmacp5, Δmacp6, and Δmacp7 mutant strains showed 0.36 ± 0.05, 0.32 ± 0.03, and 0.25 ± 0.02, respectively, when compared with wild type, which is a highly significant decrease in mupirocin production. The pairwise mutants Δmacp5/6, Δmacp6/7, and Δmacp5/7 produced 0.11 ± 0.01, 0.16 ± 0.01, and 0.10 ± 0.02, respectively, compared with wild type as shown in Fig. 5B, a further significant decrease. This observation is more or less consistent with the expected additive effect of a double deletion except for Δmacp6/7 that showed higher production than for the other double knock-outs. However, it would not be surprising if there were variations in the activities of the different mACPs especially because as argued below mACP5 may work in series rather than in parallel with mACP6 and mACP7. The effect of removing mACP domains could be due not just to loss of 1 unit of ACP activity but could also be because of secondary effects on the remaining enzymic activities in MmpA or MmpB because of conformational changes in the protein. We therefore determined the effect of inactivating an ACP by a point mutation that would minimize structural changes. The point mutants macp3S>A (Mmp I S2664A), macp4S>A (MmpA S2769A), macp5S>A (Mmp II S1390A), macp6S>A (Mmp II S1478A) and macp7S>A (Mmp II S1574A) produced 0.61 ± 0.01, 0.72 ± 0.03, 0.03 ± 0.01, 0.66 ± 0.03, and 0.85 ± 0.13 when compared with the wild type as shown in Fig. 5. For mACP3 and mACP4 these results are generally in line with the deletion of whole mACP domains. The results were unexpected in the triplet cluster. Surprisingly macp5S>A showed no detectable mupirocin production, whereas the effect of the point mutations in macp6 and macp7 was much less than expected. This study has focused on why there are tandemly repeated mACP domains in the Type I Mmps of the mupirocin biosynthetic cluster when normally only one such domain would be expected. Our strategy was to inactivate the mACP domains and determine the effects by antibacterial bioassay and by HPLC. Although we were able to detect changes in clearing zone for the double deletions in the triplet cluster, the major conclusion from the plate bioassay was that each ACP in a cluster is functional and is capable of substituting for the other ACPs in that cluster. This seems much higher than the basal level of interchangeability expected between very different ACPs observed in previous work. For example, only weak complementation by the fatty acid synthase ACP was obtained for an ACP mutant in the act system of Streptomyces coelicolor where the level of identity was 31% identity between the ACPs (13Revill W. Bibb M. Hopwood D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5660-5667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that any of the ACP domains in the mup tandem clusters can suffice means that they can substitute for each other. It also indicates that these tandem clusters represent a single step in the biosynthetic pathway or that a single ACP can support more than one step. HPLC analysis gave more reproducible results than the plate assay and provided the basis for the detailed quantitative analysis that we have performed. The consistent result was that the wild type with intact doublet or triplet clusters gave higher yields of mupirocin than any of the mutants and in the case of the triplet cluster progressive deletions of pairs generally gave bigger effects than deletion of single mACPs. Before detailed consideration of the quantitative data it is important to consider that the effect of deleting a domain could either be because of the loss of the function of that domain or could arise from conformational changes on the rest of the protein arising from the deletion. To address this issue a point mutation was introduced into the active sites of ACP3, ACP4, ACP5, ACP6, and ACP7, resulting in the inability of the mutated ACPs to be converted into a holoenzyme by the addition of the phosphopantetheine arm. In the case of doublet ACPs this had a similar effect to that of deleting the whole domain. The similar loss of activity caused by deletion or point mutation for both mACP3 and mACP4 sugge"

Most such determinants have been localized to the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain, but other domains in the subunit proteins can play roles in modulating receptor surface expression. Here we demonstrate that formation of an intact glutamate binding site also acts as an additional quality-control check for surface expression of homomeric and heteromeric kainate receptors. A key ligand-binding residue in the KA2 subunit, threonine 675, was mutated to either alanine or glutamate, which eliminated affinity for the receptor ligands kainate and glutamate. We found that plasma membrane expression of heteromeric GluR6/KA2(T675A) or GluR6/KA2(T675E) kainate receptors was markedly reduced compared with wild-type GluR6/KA2 receptors in transfected HEK 293 and COS-7 cells and in cultured neurons. Surface expression of homomeric KA2 receptors lacking a retention/retrieval determinant (KA2-R/A) was also reduced upon mutation of Thr-675 and elimination of the ligand binding site. KA2 Thr-675 mutant subunits were able to co-assemble with GluR5 and GluR6 subunits and were degraded at the same rate as wild-type KA2 subunit protein. These results suggest that glutamate binding and associated conformational changes are prerequisites for forward trafficking of intracellular kainate receptors following multimeric assembly.

Modulation of the biosynthesis and intracellular trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors underlies plasticity at some excitatory synapses in the mammalian central nervous system (1Bredt D.S.

The nascent receptors are then transported forward through the secretory pathway to their sites of functional activity, which in neurons can be in postsynaptic densities or at extrasynaptic sites. Synaptic AMPA receptor numbers are modulated by both constitutive and activity-dependent endo- and exocytosis processes; for example, AMPA receptors are rapidly transferred to or removed from postsynaptic densities in response to distinct patterns of tetanic stimuli or NMDA receptor activation (3Hayashi Y.

NMDA receptors in synapses were originally thought to be relatively static compared with AMPA receptors (6Carroll R.C. Lissin D.V. von Zastrow M. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), but more recent reports have demonstrated dynamic regulation of NMDA receptor trafficking in ways that might affect induction of synaptic plasticity (Refs. 7Grosshans D.R.

Relatively few examples of activity-dependent changes in neuronal kainate receptors have been reported (10Kidd F.L. Isaac J.T.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2766-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the cellular mechanisms that underlie those functional changes remain obscure. Transit of ionotropic glutamate receptors through the secretory and endocytic pathways is primarily controlled by interactions between cellular chaperone proteins and discrete motifs on the receptor subunits, which are located predominantly on the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain. These domains are particularly important in the control of receptor egress from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) after receptor assembly. A number of critical ER-trafficking determinants have been identified in glutamate receptor subunits, which include arginine-rich sequences in NR1, GluR5–2b, GluR5–2c, GluR6, and KA2 subunits that promote ER retention/retrieval (12Scott D.B.

Neuron. 2002; 34: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition to cytoplasmic determinants, glutamate receptors in the ER are subject to a resident quality control system that verifies that the proteins are properly folded and assembled before export to Golgi compartments (21Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Non-cytoplasmic determinants in the transmembrane and extracellular domains within the receptor subunits are participants in this quality control process. RNA editing at the Q/R site of GluR2 AMPA receptor subunits reduces calcium permeability (22Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) and channel conductance (23Swanson G.T. Kamboj S.K. Cull-Candy S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 58-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was recently shown to control trafficking and assembly in the ER by preventing tetramerization of all-edited subunits into a functional receptor (18Greger I.H. Khatri L. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 24Greger I.H. Khatri L. Kong X. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2003; 40: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that glutamate binding to receptors in the ER acts as a checkpoint for forward trafficking by probing receptor functionality, because mutations that eliminate binding in the Caenorhabditis elegans GLR-1 AMPA receptor subunit and the GluR6 kainate receptor subunit promoted retention of these receptors (25Grunwald M.E. Kaplan J.M. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Fleck M.W. Cornell E. Mah S.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have tested the hypothesis that ligand binding is a critical checkpoint in kainate receptor trafficking by introducing a mutation into the ligand binding domain of the KA2 subunit, a subunit that does not form functional homomeric kainate receptors (14Ren Z. Riley N.J. Garcia E.P. Sanders J.M. Swanson G.T. Marshall J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6608-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Assembly of KA2 subunits with GluR5, GluR6, or GluR7 subunits produces functional heteromeric receptors with distinct pharmacological and physiological characteristics (27Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 28Schiffer H.H. Swanson G.T. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1141-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). KA2 homomers are retained in the ER because this subunit contains an arginine-based retrieval/retention motif in the cytoplasmic domain. Mutation of this trafficking determinant releases homomeric KA2 receptors from the ER, but despite plasma membrane expression the receptors do not gate currents in response to high concentrations of glutamate (14Ren Z. Riley N.J. Garcia E.P. Sanders J.M. Swanson G.T. Marshall J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6608-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that elimination of the glutamate binding affinity in the KA2 subunit caused retention of this subunit as well as heteromeric kainate receptor complexes that incorporated the mutated subunit in both transfected cell lines and neurons. Retention was not accompanied by an increased degradation rate, suggesting that the mutation did not cause gross misfolding of the receptors. These data support the hypothesis that glutamate binding is a checkpoint in the biosynthesis of kainate receptors. Further, we suggest that binding-related conformational changes in the receptor structure, rather than ion permeation through the channel, are critical for this quality control pathway. Molecular Biology—Myc-KA2, myc-KA2-R/A, and myc-KA2ΔR6 cDNAs were obtained from John Marshall (Brown University, Providence, RI), and GFP-GluR6 cDNA was obtained from Steve Heinemann (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). KA2(T675E) and KA2(T675A) cDNAs were generated using the QuikChange site mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). All the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Electrophysiology—HEK 293 cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (17Yan S. Sanders J.M. Xu J. Zhu Y. Contractor A. Swanson G.T. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Receptor cDNAs were transfected in combination with a plasmid DNA containing enhanced GFP (typically 0.3 and 0.1 μg, respectively). For experiments with heteromeric receptors, GluR6, KA2, and enhanced GFP cDNAs were transfected in a 1:6:1 ratio. Patch clamp recordings were performed 2 days after transfection using a Zeiss Axioskop FS2 microscope (Carl Zeiss), Axopatch 200B amplifier, and pClamp 9 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Extracellular solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.3). Intracellular solutions contained 110 mm CsF, 30 mm CsCl, 4 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm EGTA (adjusted to pH 7.3). Glutamate (10 mm) and (S)-AMPA (300 μm) were applied to transfected cells using a fast application system described previously (17Yan S. Sanders J.M. Xu J. Zhu Y. Contractor A. Swanson G.T. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed off-line using Clampfit software (Axon Instruments). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—Transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 0.1 or 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 130 μm bestatin, 14 μm E-64, 1 mm leupeptin, 0.3 μm aprotinin). Supernatants were obtained after lysis and centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating lysate supernatants with anti-GFP antibody (2.5 μg, JL-8, BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) followed by incubation with 50 μl of 50% protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) slurry overnight. After four washes in lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 2× sample buffer and then separated by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-myc antibody (0.1 μg/ml, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection technique (Amersham Biosciences). Immunolocalization of Receptors—Cell surface receptors were detected in transfected COS-7 cells following incubation with polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:500) or polyclonal anti-myc antibody (1:500) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated goat secondary antibody (Alexa 594, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. For co-localization of surface receptors and intracellular receptors, after surface labeling and fixation transfected cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After several washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with polyclonal anti-KA2 primary antibody (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 2 h at room temperature. To visualize myc-KA2 subunit co-localization with Golgi, transfected cells were fixed and permeabilized before incubation with polyclonal anti-giantin (1:1000, Covance, Richmond, CA) and monoclonal anti-myc antibodies. To co-localize myc-KA2 and ER compartments, polyclonal anti-KA2 and monoclonal anti-PDI (1:200, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) antibodies were used. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with the appropriate fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 594 or 633, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Surface and intracellular immunofluorescence was captured with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For clarity in presentation, the long red fluorescence emitted by Alexa 633 was false-colored as cyan in the figures. Representative images in the figures are single optical slices with thickness of 0.38–0.40 μm. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—ELISAs were performed using a modified version of a described previously protocol (8Nong Y. Huang Y.Q. Ju W. Kalia L.V. Ahmadian G. Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 2003; 422: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Briefly, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media was removed from transfected COS-7 cells cultured in 12-well plates, and cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS. Cells were incubated at 4 °C with anti-GFP (1:200) or anti-myc (1:100) antibody for 30 min at 4 °C, washed extensively with ice-cold PBS, and fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000, Amersham Biosciences). Cells were again washed with PBS, the horseradish peroxidase substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was added, and the color reaction was developed for 2–3 h. The optical density of 0.3 ml of supernatant was read on a spectrophotometer at 492 nm. Values for cell surface expression of kainate receptors were determined by averaging at least four replicates in each experiment and subtracting the mean absorbance in wells with non-transfected cells. Three separate experiments were performed with each set of receptor cDNAs. Neuronal Cell Culture, Transfection, and Imaging—Hippocampal neurons from postnatal day 0 rats were cultured using the methods described previously (29Murthy V.N. Sejnowski T.J. Stevens C.F. Neuron. 1997; 18: 599-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). After 3–4 days in culture, cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method. Transfected cultures were allowed to grow for another week. Immunocytochemistry was performed when cells were 10–11 days in vitro. For surface labeling of GFP-GluR6, living cells were incubated with chicken anti-GFP polyclonal antibody in cell culture media (1:500, Chemicon) for 20 min at 37 °C, rinsed twice with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS. For intracellular labeling of myc-KA2, cells were permeabilized by incubation with PBS/0.15% Triton X-100 solution for 10 min in cold room. The cells were then blocked in PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin for 2–3 h at room temperature, mouse anti-myc antibody (1:2000, Covance) was applied for 1 h at room temperature, and the cells were washed with PBS/10% bovine serum albumin. Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-chicken IgG (1:500, Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 350 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Molecular Probes) secondary antibody were applied for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were rinsed extensively with PBS and mounted. Neurons were observed on an LSM510 Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope, and images were analyzed by using a Simple PCI Image Analysis System (Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Regions of interest were drawn around the fluorescent cell bodies, and the average pixel intensity was calculated. To correct the background, equivalent regions of interest were drawn outside the fluorescent neurons in the same image, and the average pixel intensities were subtracted from the neuronal fluorescence. Fluorescence is expressed in intensity units per pixel, and data are presented as mean ± S.E. Pulse-chase Assays—HEK 293 QA cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). After 36 h, cells were incubated in cysteine- and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium starvation media for 30 min. Starvation media was removed and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium labeling media containing EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 30 min, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and returned to normal growth media, including brefeldin A (10 μg/ml, Calbiochem) and methionine for the duration of the chase to the specified time points. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated on ice for 10 min in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) after which solubilized extracts were collected for immunoprecipitation. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-myc antibody, resolved with SDS-PAGE, and quantified on a PhosphorImager 425S (Amersham Biosciences). The measured densities of at each time point were normalized to the image density at time point zero. Radioligand Binding Assays—Crude membrane fractions were prepared from transiently transfected COS-7 cells by first homogenizing in buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.32 m sucrose, pH 7.4), centrifuging at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and re-centrifuging the supernatant at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of homogenizing buffer, and the process was repeated twice. The final membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and 25 μg of membrane protein was used in radioligand binding assays with 5, 10, and 50 nm [3H]kainate. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 mm glutamate. Binding was carried out for 1 h at 4 °C before rapid filtration on Whatman GF/C glass filters through a Brandel Cell Harvester (Biomedical Research and Development Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), three washes with cold 0.9% saline solution, addition of scintillation fluid and counting on a Beckman LS5000 TD scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). To determine how elimination of glutamate binding affinity of KA2 subunits affected the biosynthesis and pharmacological properties of heteromeric kainate receptors, we first altered a critical threonine residue in the putative binding domain of the KA2 subunit to either an alanine (T675A) or a glutamate (T675E) using site mutagenesis of the receptor cDNA. The hydroxyl moiety of the equivalent threonine in GluR2 (T655) forms an essential hydrogen bond with the γ-carboxyl group of glutamate and kainate (30Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Mutation of the equivalent residue in the NR2A subunits increased the EC50 for glutamate by three orders of magnitude (31Anson L.C. Chen P.E. Wyllie D.J.A. Colquhoun D. Schoepfer R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and eliminated specific binding of [3H]kainate to chick kainate-binding protein (32Paas Y. Eisenstein M. Medevielle F. Teichberg V.I. Devillers-Thie ́ry A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 979-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, neither KA2(T675A) nor KA2(T675E) receptors bound [3H]kainate in radioligand assays using membrane preparations from transfected COS-7 cells; that is, total binding was not different from nonspecific binding at any concentration tested (5–50 nm, data not shown). In contrast, specific binding of [3H]kainate was robust in membranes from cells expressing wild-type KA2 subunits and was consistent with the KD of ∼15 nm described previously (27Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation of Thr-675 eliminated detectable ligand binding to the KA2 subunit. To determine how the loss of a functional glutamate binding site affected heteromeric kainate receptors, we co-transfected HEK-293 cells with myc-tagged KA2, KA2(T675A), and KA2(T675E) cDNAs with GluR6 cDNAs. Currents arising from heteromeric GluR6/KA2 receptors were distinguished in patch clamp recordings on the basis of their rapid desensitization in response to a 100-ms application of 10 mm glutamate (Fig. 1A), as described previously (33Swanson G.T. Green T. Heinemann S.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 942-949PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we selected only those cells in which peak current amplitudes elicited by 300 μm S-AMPA were at least 25% of those evoked by glutamate to exclude cells expressing predominantly homomeric GluR6 receptors, which can occur even when cDNA ratios are as high as 1:6 (GluR6:KA2). Consistent with earlier reports, GluR6/KA2 receptor currents desensitized with a τdes of 1.6 ± 0.1 ms (n = 3) in cells that exhibited robust responses to (S)-AMPA (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, we could not detect AMPA-evoked currents from GluR6/KA2(T675A) and GluR6/KA2(T675E) cells (n = 6, Fig. 1A), suggesting that the mutations also eliminated low affinity binding of AMPA to the KA2 subunit. Glutamate-evoked currents present in a subset of cells expressing the mutant heteromeric receptors desensitized at a rate similar to homomeric GluR6 receptors (GluR6/KA2(T675A): τdes = 5.3 ± 0.6 ms, n = 3; GluR6/KA2(T675E): τdes = 5.6 ± 0.6 ms, n = 4; GluR6: τdes = 4.1 ± 0.2 ms (34Swanson G.T. Gereau IV, R.W. Green T. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1997; 19: 913-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1B). We next determined if mutation of the ligand binding site occluded multimeric assembly of receptor subunits, thereby preventing formation of heteromeric receptors. Membranes were prepared from HEK 293 cells co-expressing GFP-tagged GluR6 and myc-tagged KA2 receptor subunits, and receptor proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation with an anti-GFP antibody. Proteins were separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western analysis with an anti-myc primary antibody (Fig. 1C). Myc-KA2, myc-KA2(T675A), and myc-KA2(T675E) protein were abundant following immunoprecipitation of GFP-GluR6 protein (Fig. 1C, IP lane), indicating that the wild-type and mutant KA2 subunits had formed multimeric receptors with GFP-GluR6 subunits. These results suggested that the absence of AMPA-evoked currents in heteromeric receptors was not due to compromised assembly of mutant KA2 subunits with GluR6. In our initial physiology recordings we were not able to resolve whether glutamate-evoked currents in a subset of co-transfected cells arose from heteromeric GluR6/KA2(T675A) and GluR6/KA2(T675E) receptors or rather from homomeric GluR6 receptors. To determine if cells expressing both GluR6 and the KA2 mutants contained heteromeric kainate receptors on their plasma membrane, we assessed their localization using immunofluorescent techniques. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with GFP-GluR5–2b or GFP-GluR6 in combination with myc-KA2 or myc-KA2(T675A) cDNAs (Fig. 2A). Cells were first stained for surface-expressed GFP-GluR5–2b or GFP-GluR6 with an anti-GFP primary antibody under non-permeabilizing conditions, followed by permeabilization and labeling of intracellular myc-KA2 (or KA2 mutants) with an anti-myc antisera. Fig. 2A shows representative examples of the three-color analysis we performed in these experiments: green fluorescence arises from total GFP-GluR5–2b or GFP-GluR6 receptors, red from surface GFP-tagged receptors, and cyan from intra- and extracellular myc-KA2 (originally acquired at long red wavelengths and false-colored for clarity). In cells expressing wild-type GFP-GluR5–2b/myc-KA2 and GFP-GluR6/myc-KA2, GFP-tagged receptors were abundant on the plasma membrane of co-transfected cells (Fig. 2A, center column). In contrast, cells co-transfected with myc-KA2(T675A) or myc-KA2(T675E) had significantly lower levels of detectable surface GFP-GluR5–2b or GFP-GluR6, and indeed most of the co-transfected cells imaged had no apparent receptor subunits on the plasma membrane. These results suggest that the altered KA2 subunit acts as dominant suppressor of forward trafficking in heteromeric kainate receptors and support the interpretation that the residual glutamate currents in patch clamp recordings arose from homomeric GluR6 receptors that did not contain a mutant KA2 subunit. We also tested if mutation of the ligand binding site prevented surface expression of a homomeric KA2 subunit. As described previously (14Ren Z. Riley N.J. Garcia E.P. Sanders J.M. Swanson G.T. Marshall J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6608-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), wild-type KA2 receptors are efficiently retained in the endoplasmic reticulum by virtue of an arginine-based retention/retrieval signal in the cytoplasmic tail. Alanine substitution of this motif in KA2-R/A mutants releases KA2 receptors to the plasma membrane (see Fig. 2B), but the receptors still do not gate currents in"
https://openalex.org/W2084154512,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed, albeit at low or intermediate levels, in human melanomas at the different stages of tumor progression. Coexpression of EGFR with its ligand TGFα indicates their role in paracrine and autocrine growth regulation of melanomas. As it was previously observed for several types of cancer, specific inhibitors of EGFR-mediated signaling may reduce antiapoptotic properties of cancer cells and sensitize them to cytotoxic drugs. We recently reported that arsenite, particularly in combination with inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, induces high levels of apoptosis in different melanomas. Since EGFR signaling operates via activation of the PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK pathways, we suggested that the combination of arsenite and EGFR inhibitors might also effectively induce apoptosis in melanoma. Here, we demonstrate that a moderate concentration of arsenite (5–10 μ M) indeed upregulates apoptosis induced by EGFR inhibitors in EGFR-positive melanomas. In contrast, induction of apoptosis in melanomas with negligible surface expression of EGFR or with defective EGFR signaling requires direct suppression of the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways by specific pharmacological inhibitors in the presence of arsenite. Under these conditions, metastatic melanoma cell lines undergo TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)- and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, these data provide additional approaches in sensitizing melanomas to the cytotoxic effects of specific inhibitors of survival pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1969784891,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 regulates transcription of many genes that mediate cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair and other cellular responses. Here we show that Ipaf, a human CED-4 homologue and an activator of caspase-1, is induced by p53. Overexpression of p53 by transfection in U2OS and A549 cells increased Ipaf mRNA levels. Treatment of p53-positive cell lines U2OS and MCF-7 with the DNA damaging drug, doxorubicin, which increases p53 protein level, induced expression of Ipaf mRNA but similar treatment of MCF-7-mp53 (a clone of MCF-7 cells expressing mutant p53) and p53-negative K562 cells showed much less induction of Ipaf gene expression. Expression analysis for Ipaf mRNA in doxorubicin-treated human tumor cell lines suggests that p53-dependent as well as p53-independent mechanisms are involved in the regulation of Ipaf gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner. The Ipaf promoter was activated by normal p53 but not by His(273) mutant of p53. A functional p53-binding site was identified in the Ipaf promoter. A dominant-negative mutant of Ipaf inhibited p53-induced and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by about 50%. Ipaf-directed small hairpin RNA downregulated p53-induced Ipaf gene expression and also reduced p53-induced apoptosis. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was also inhibited by Ipaf-directed small hairpin RNA. Our results show that p53 can directly induce Ipaf gene transcription, which contributes to p53-dependent apoptosis in at least some human cells."

https://openalex.org/W2047329830,"The perturbations of the cytokine signaling pathway play an important role in lymphoid/hematopoietic tumors. Aberrant promoter methylation is the major mechanism of gene silencing in tumors. We examined 150 lymphoid/hematopoietic tumors or potential premalignant specimens, 55 control specimens and 12 EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cultures and 10 lymphoma/leukemia (L/L) or multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines for the methylation (and, in cell lines, of the expression status) of three genes involved in the cytokine signaling pathway. The genes were: SHP1, a protein tyrosine phosphatase; SYK, a protein kinase; and SOCS1, a suppressor of cytokine signaling. Our major findings were: (1) one or more of the three genes was frequently methylated in L/L and MM cell lines and there was good concordance (90-100%) between methylation and loss of gene expression; (2) treatment of L/L cell lines with a demethylating agent resulted in re-expression of SHP1 protein and downregulation of phosphorylated STAT3 in L/L cell lines; (3) all 55 control specimens and the lymphoblastoid cultures were negative for methylation of the three genes; (4) non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (100%), and leukemias (94%) had almost universal methylation of SHP1 and relatively less frequent (<30%) methylation of SOCS1 and SYK; (5) MM and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) had infrequent methylation of SHP1 (<20%), and occasional methylation of SOCS1 and SYK; and (6) comparable methylation frequencies for SOCS1 were observed in MM and MGUS, suggesting that SOCS1 methylation is an early event in MM pathogenesis. At least one gene was methylated in 119 of 130 (93%) of the malignant and 12 of 20 (60%) of the MGUS samples. Our findings demonstrate that the perturbations of cytokine signaling via silencing of these three genes are almost universal in lymphoid/hematopoietic tumors but the patterns of gene methylated for L/L and plasma cell dyscrasias are different."

https://openalex.org/W2093146747,"Transcription-generated DNA supercoiling plays a decisive role in a promoter relay mechanism for the coordinated expression of genes in the Salmonella typhimurium ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster. A similar mechanism also operates to control expression of the genes in the Escherichia coli ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster. However, the mechanism underlying the DNA supercoiling effect remained elusive. A bacterial gene silencer AT8 was found to be important for the repression state of the leuO gene as part of the promoter relay mechanism. In this communication, we demonstrated that the gene silencer AT8 is a nucleation site for recruiting histone-like nucleoid structuring protein to form a cis-spreading nucleoprotein filament that is responsible for silencing of the leuO gene. With a DNA geometric similarity rather than a DNA sequence specificity, the E. coli gene silencer EAT6 was capable of replacing the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein nucleation function of the S. typhimurium gene silencer AT8 for the leuO gene silencing. The interchangeability between DNA geometrical elements for supporting the silencing activity in the region is consistent with a previous finding that a neighboring transcription activity determines the outcome of the gene silencing activity. The geometric requirement, which was revealed for this silencing activity, explains the decisive role of transcription-generated DNA supercoiling found in the promoter relay mechanism. Transcription-generated DNA supercoiling plays a decisive role in a promoter relay mechanism for the coordinated expression of genes in the Salmonella typhimurium ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster. A similar mechanism also operates to control expression of the genes in the Escherichia coli ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster. However, the mechanism underlying the DNA supercoiling effect remained elusive. A bacterial gene silencer AT8 was found to be important for the repression state of the leuO gene as part of the promoter relay mechanism. In this communication, we demonstrated that the gene silencer AT8 is a nucleation site for recruiting histone-like nucleoid structuring protein to form a cis-spreading nucleoprotein filament that is responsible for silencing of the leuO gene.

DNA supercoiling has been known to play important roles in transcriptional regulation (1Pruss G.J. Drlica K.

By using a bacterial transcription regulation model system, we have demonstrated that transcription-generated DNA supercoiling is a crucial driven force that triggers the sequential activation of genes in the Salmonella typhimurium ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster (8Wu H.Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Wu H.Y. Fang M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

This rather complex sequential gene activation process was named the promoter relay mechanism (11Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29929-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact molecular detail that underlies the effect of transcription-generated DNA supercoiling on the sequential activation of genes at this locus remains unclear. The direct DNA supercoiling effect on activating promoters of genes in this region has been ruled out. Instead, the effect appears to mediate through cis-elements within the locus control regions (LCRs 1The abbreviations used are: LCRs, locus control regions; H-NS, histone-like nucleoid structuring protein; b-caa, branched-chain amino acids; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay.1The abbreviations used are: LCRs, locus control regions; H-NS, histone-like nucleoid structuring protein; b-caa, branched-chain amino acids; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay. illustrated in Fig. 1) located between genes in the ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster (8Wu H.Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Fig. 1Genes in the E. coli ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster are regulated via the promoter relay mechanism. The arrangements of genes in the ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster of E. coli and S. typhimurium are illustrated. The AT-rich DNA sequences flanking the leuO gene are important for the expression regulation of genes in the gene cluster. The AT-rich DNAs, upstream and downstream of leuO, are named locus control regions, LCR-I and LCR-II, respectively. Illustrated in the 318-bp S. typhimurium LCR-I are the two identified cis-elements, the repression element AT8, and the derepression element AT7. E. coli relA1 strain, MC4100, was grown in 17-amino acid SSA medium. The absorbance reading at 600 nm was measured and plotted against post-inoculation time in the growth curve. Three time points when samples were collected for Northern analysis are marked on the growth curve. A is the ethidium bromide-stained gel for confirming the equal amount of RNA loading of the subsequent Northern hybridization. B and C are the Northern blots for detecting transcripts expressed from either the ilvIH operon or the leuO gene, respectively. The lane numbers in A–C correspond with three time points marked in the growth curve. D and E are the primer extension studies that detect the activities of pilvIH, pleuO, and pbla on the plasmids, as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although not ruling out the possible involvement of other cis-acting elements in the transcription regulation, we have identified two cis-elements in the LCR-I that are important for the promoter relay mechanism as follows: a bacterial gene silencer, termed AT8; and a LeuO protein-binding site, termed AT7 (13Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Chen C.C. Ghole M. Majumder A. Wang Z. Chandana S. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38094-38103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The bacterial gene silencer AT8-mediated transcriptional silencing is integral to the gene expression regulation and is responsible for the repressed state of the leuO gene. LeuO protein-mediated derepression, which relieves the repression of leuO gene, is also a crucial part of the promoter relay mechanism. Transcription-generated DNA supercoiling is likely to play its roles in the promoter relay mechanism via modulating the processes of the repression-derepression control (10Chen C.C. Wu H.Y. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To better understand the DNA supercoiling effect, we investigated the basic molecular criteria of the repression element (gene silencer) and derepression element (LeuO-binding site). We revealed that it is the geometric features of the DNA rather than the specific sequences of the transcription elements that are important for their transcription regulatory functions. The striking DNA geometric requirement is consistent with the involvement of transcription-generated DNA supercoiling in the transcription regulatory process. The revealed DNA geometric features of the gene silencer also provided clues for the possible involvement in the transcription regulation of chromosome architectural proteins (e.g. HU, H-NS, Lap, and IFS, etc.) that usually recognize DNA structure rather than specific DNA sequence for their bindings (15Ussery D.

Indeed, a genetic screening has led to the identification of a histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS) for its role in the gene silencing mechanism. Functionally, we demonstrated that the gene silencer AT8 is indeed an H-NS nucleation site that triggers the formation of a nucleoprotein filament structure in the region. With the assistance of the neighboring AT-rich DNA in LCR-I, the transcriptional repressive nucleoprotein structure reaches (cis-spreads) to the promoter region of the leuO gene and results in the repression of the gene. Despite the low DNA sequence homology, the Escherichia coli gene silencer EAT6, but not a same size neutral DNA sequence, was capable of replacing the S. typhimurium gene silencer AT8 for its H-NS nucleation function in S. typhimurium LCR-I. Therefore, it is clear that regardless of the low DNA sequence specificity, either the S. typhimurium gene silencer AT8 or the E. coli gene silencer must provide the crucial DNA geometry for triggering the H-NS nucleation. The recruited H-NS, along with other nucleoproteins, appear to form a cis-spreading nucleoprotein filament that represses the activities of promoters located within the proximity. Plasmids and Bacterial Strains—Plasmid constructs: pAO, pEV101, and pWU204 have been described previously (12Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Majumder A. Fang M. Tsai K.J. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19046-19051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A 75-bp DNA (positions +48 to -27 of ilvIH), including the -10 sequence of the promoter of ilvIH, was deleted from pWU204 and resulted in pWU205; otherwise pWU205 is identical to pWU204. The 393-bp E. coli LCR-I was generated using PCR. Primers 5′-GTCAACCCTGACGTCATAAAAACGTCC-3′ and 5′-GAATGAGTCATTTACGACGTCATAATAATCCATAATG-3′ were used in the PCR. The primers contain mismatches (the underlined sequences) for producing AatII restriction sites on both ends of the PCR product. The AatII-digested E. coli LCR-I was inserted into the unique AatII site on pAO. Other pAO-based testing plasmids were also derived by using similar strategies, and those DNA inserts involved are individually described in the experiments. The plasmid, pWU802, was derived from pWU804 (8Wu H.Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) by deleting a 1.4-kb BamHI-NsiI fragment that includes the coding region of leuO gene and the downstream pilvIH. To replace AT8 DNA in S. typhimurium LCR-I on pWU802 with EAT6 DNA, the following two DNA oligomers were chemically synthesized: 5′-taaatatataaattaattattaaataagcacatttaatcATCATTCACTTG-3′ and 5′-GTGAATGATgattaaatgtgcttatttaataattaatttatatattta-3′; the lowercase DNA sequence is EAT6 DNA. The annealed DNA was used to replace the 58-bp HpaI-DraIII fragment containing AT8 in S. typhimurium LCR-I on pWU802. With a similar approach, the following two synthetic DNA oligomers, consisting of a neutral DNA sequence (part of the nucleotide sequences of the coding region of lacZ), were used to replace AT8 on pWU802: 5′-aaccatcgaagtgaccagcgaatacctgttccgtcatagcgataacgATCATTCACTTG-3′ and 5′-GTGAATGATcgttatcgctatgacggaacaggtattcgctggtcacttcgatggtt-3′; the lowercase is the neutral DNA sequence used. The procedures resulted in the precise replacement of the AT8 DNA sequence with either the E. coli repression element EAT6 or the neutral DNA sequence to maintain the flanking DNA sequences in LCR-I as intact. For plasmids, pWU802-LA and pWU802-LH were derived from pWU802. DNA oligomers containing the 27-bp lac repressor binding sequence (lac operator) 5′-CGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCG-3′and the flanking restriction sites were synthesized, annealed, and ligated at the AatII site or the HindIII site on pWU802 to generate pWU802-LA or pWU-802-LH, respectively. Plasmid pWU902OZ was derived from pWU802. The leu-500 mutation (A to G transition) at the -10 region of the promoter of the leu-ABCD operon was converted back to the wild type -10 DNA sequence, otherwise the LCR-I DNA, which controls the expression of the downstream leuO promoter, stayed the same as that in pWU802. The entire coding sequence of lacZ gene, along with its upstream ShineDelgarno sequence, was positioned downstream of the transcription-initiation site of the leuO gene so that the leuO promoter can control the expression of lacZ gene product as a reporter for leuO promoter activity. Plasmid pCH501S-(AT8)2 was derived from pCH301-(AT8)2, which has been described in a previous study (14Chen C.C. Ghole M. Majumder A. Wang Z. Chandana S. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38094-38103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The coding region of the sacB gene was used to replace the coding region of gfpUV of pCH301-(AT8)2. The coding region of the sacB gene was amplified using PCR in the presence of DNA template pEX100T (19Hoang T.T. Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kutchma A.J. Schweizer H.P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. Herbert Schweizer (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado), and two primers 5′-AACGTAGATCTAGAAAAAGGAGACATGAACG-3′ and 5′-TCGACACTAGTCTCTTTTGCGTTTTTATTTG-3′. Subsequently, the synthetic promoter, psyn(5/6;5/6), of pCH301-(AT8)2 was replaced with the annealed DNA product of two oligomers, 5′-CACTTGGTGTATGATTGTGTATTCGCCATAGTTATGGTTATATTGCTTGCA-3′ and 5′-GATCTGCAAGCAATATAACCATAACTATGGCGAATACACAATCATACACCAAGTGCATG-3′, that consists of the minimum promoter sequence of the S. typhimurium leuO gene. The resultant plasmid, pCH501S-(AT8)2, contains the sacB gene controlled by the expression of the leuO promoter, which is repressed by (AT8)2, the tandem repeat sequence of the gene silencer AT8. PSO1000 is a pACYC-based (low copy number) plasmid carrying the laci gene for expressing the lac repressor (20Lehming N. Sartorius J. Niemoller M. Genenger G. van Wilcken-Bergmann B. Muller-Hill B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3145-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). E. coli MC1060, a lac repressor deletion strain (21Casadaban M.J. Cohen S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar), has been described previously (22Wu H.Y. Liu L.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The leuO- strain, MF1, and its parental strain, MC4100, have also been described previously (18Majumder A. Fang M. Tsai K.J. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19046-19051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Dr. Chiharu Ueguchi (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan) kindly provided us with CU284 (23Yamashino T. Kakeda M. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which is a hns::neo strain derived from MC4100. SC1(leuO-; hns-) was constructed by introducing the hns::neo mutation into MF1 (recipient strain) by P1 transduction using CU284 as a donor strain. Hence, the MF1 and SC1 pair was leuO::cam hns+ and leuO::cam hns- isogenic. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C with aeration or in a synthetic (chemically defined) medium base SSA supplemented with all amino acids except for the three branched-chain amino acids isoleucine, leucine, and valine (18Majumder A. Fang M. Tsai K.J. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19046-19051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Growth in the synthetic medium was at 32 °C with aeration. Ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and tetracycline (6.25 μg/ml) were added, as needed. Primer Extension—Primer extension was carried out as described previously (13Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The following primers were used: (i) 5′-TCTGGGTGAGACAAAACAGGAAGGC-3′ for detecting pbla-mediated transcripts; (ii) 5′-GAAACCATTATTATCATGACATTAACC-3′ for detecting E. coli pilvIH-mediated transcripts; (iii) 5′-GCATATAAAATAAGAAAAAGCAAAATGAGTAAAATTCG-3′ for detecting E. coli pleuO-mediated transcript; and (iv) 5′-CGGAAAACATAAAGACGCTGACAGAGAC-3′ for detecting S. typhimurium pleuO-mediated transcripts. Each primer extension reaction consisted of 100 μg of total RNA and DNA primer(s). Two primers were mixed in the primer extension reactions for simultaneous detection of the bla and ilvIH transcripts in the results as shown in Fig. 1D and the ilvIH and leuO transcripts in the results as shown in Fig. 1E. In other primer extension reactions, only one primer was used for detecting an individual RNA transcript. The primer extension results were visualized and quantified by using a STORM imaging system 840 (Amersham Biosciences). The quantification was normalized against the content of plasmid DNA in each experiment. Northern Hybridization—The total RNA preparations and the procedures for Northern hybridization were conducted as described previously (11Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29929-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—As described previously (14Chen C.C. Ghole M. Majumder A. Wang Z. Chandana S. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38094-38103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), all testing DNA segments were annealed pairs of synthetic DNA oligomers consisting of DNA sequences complementary to each other as illustrated in the figures. All synthetic DNA oligomers were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase prior to the annealing. The radioactively labeled duplex DNAs (15 pg per reaction; ∼10,000 cpm/reaction) were then mixed with the purified histidine-tagged S. typhimurium LeuO protein in a binding buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0; 4 mm MgCl2; 70 mm KCl; 0.1 mm EDTA; and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). The binding reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The mixtures were then analyzed on 5% native polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3; 1 mm EDTA). Results were visualized using a STORM imaging system 840 (Amersham Biosciences). DNase I Footprinting—PCR was used to generate DNA templates employed for DNase I footprinting studies. Each involved DNA template is described in the legend of each figure. Reaction mixtures (50 μl/reaction) containing radioactively labeled DNA (1 ng/reaction equivalent to ∼20,000 cpm/reaction) plus increasing amounts of either purified (His)10-SLeuO or purified H-NS (kindly provided by Dr. Sylvie Rimsky, IGR, Villejuif Cedex, France) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min to a protein-DNA binding equilibrium. After the incubation, 5 μl of 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2 was added into each reaction for continued incubation at room temperature for 1 min. DNase I (units used per reaction is indicated in each figure legend) was then added to the reactions for a 90-s incubation at room temperature. The DNase I footprinting reactions were stopped by adding 140 μl of stop solution consisting of 192 mm sodium acetate, 32 mm EDTA, 0.14% SDS, and 64 μg/ml yeast RNA. The samples were then phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in gel loading buffer. To mark precisely the positions of the protein-mediated DNase I protection sites, primers used for PCR were individually used in the DNA sequencing reactions (Sequenase sequencing kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) for preparing DNA sequence ladders. By using a chemical cleavage reaction (24Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8987) Google Scholar), a G + A marker was also prepared from the radioactively end-labeled DNA. Along with one of the position markers (the DNA sequence ladders or the G + A marker), the DNA products prepared from the footprinting reactions were analyzed on 7% acrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing PAGE. Tn5 Transposon Insertion-mediated Random Mutagenesis and the Reverse Screening Procedure—1 μl of EZ::TN™ 〈KAN-2〉] Tnp Transposome™ (Epicenter), which contains the Tn5 transposon and the kanamycin-resistant gene (kanr), was mixed in a 0.2-cm electroporation cuvette with 40 μl of electrocompetent E. coli DH5α cells harboring pCH501S-(AT8)2 that were prepared by serial washes with cold 10% sterile glycerol during the mid-exponential growth phase (A600 = 0.6). Electroporation was performed in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus (set up at 25 microfarads, 200 ohms, and 2.50 kV). After adding 1 ml of SOC medium, the components are 20 g of bactotryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 0.5 g of NaCl, pH 7.5, in 1 liter of H2O (final concentrations of 20 mm MgSO4 and 20 mm glucose were added into the medium after autoclaving), the electroporated cells were transferred to a culture tube and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, cells were plated on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Once colonies formed, they were replicated onto plates with or without 5% sucrose supplement. β-Galactosidase Assay—The β-galactosidase assay was measured by hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl βd-galactosidase to produce o-nitrophenol in permeabilized bacterial cells as described previously (25Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.J. Wu H.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Direct Genomic DNA Sequencing—Chromosome DNAs were isolated from the selected Tn5 knock-out strain and used for direct genomic DNA sequencing. Primers that hybridize to the ends of the inserted transposon, Tn5, were used for a bi-directional outward sequencing that reads into the genomic DNA, flanking the Tn5 insert. The obtained DNA sequences were used to pin-point the insertion site on the bacterial genome using the Blast search (NCBI Data Bank). The direct genomic DNA sequencing was performed at the facility of Fidelity Systems Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Genes in the E. coli ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD Gene Cluster Are Regulated via the Promoter Relay Mechanism—The promoter relay mechanism was found based on the coordinated expression of genes in the S. typhimurium ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster (12Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using a plasmid-borne S. typhimurium DNA context in E. coli hosts, we initially demonstrated that transacting protein factors important for the promoter relay mechanism are functionally available in E. coli strains. This is based on the observed activation of a plasmid-borne leu-500 promoter, the hallmark of the promoter relay mechanism, in the heterogeneous (E. coli protein factors acting on S. typhimurium DNA context) assay system (data not shown). The result of this initial test prompted us to directly monitor the mRNAs of ilvIH and leuO in MC4100, an E. coli relA1 strain under an experimental condition that triggers a severe starvation for branched-chain amino acids (b-caa), isoleucine, leucine, and valine, during the log phase of bacterial growth. The leuO gene in E. coli relA1 strain is normally silent and activated in response to the starvation for b-caa during exponential growth in 17-amino acid SSA, a synthetic medium supplemented with all amino acids except the three b-caa (18Majumder A. Fang M. Tsai K.J. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19046-19051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The b-caa starvation causes a 2-h growth arrest (the slow-down period between points 2 and 3 shown in the growth curve in Fig. 1) prior to the growth resumption (the growth rate increase after point 3 in the growth curve shown in Fig. 1). We have demonstrated that the LeuO protein is required during the growth stress for cells to resume their growth after the 2-h growth arrest (growth stress) because the leuO knock-out strain, MF1, failed to resume its growth after the arrest (18Majumder A. Fang M. Tsai K.J. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19046-19051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). According to the promoter relay mechanism, the production of LeuO in MC4100 cells during growth stress is presumably because of the activation of the leuO gene triggered by the transcription activity of ilvIH promoter. The ilvIH transcription activity-dependent leuO gene activation has been demonstrated previously in S. typhimurium cells that are entering the stationary phase (25Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.J. Wu H.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); however, this has not been directly demonstrated in E. coli strains. Hence, we monitored the mRNAs of ilvIH and leuO during the growth of MC4100 in 17-amino acid SSA medium. Indeed, both ilvIH and leuO mRNAs were only detectable at the end of the 2-h growth arrest prior to the cell growth resumption (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 3). Both mRNAs were not detected at the time points during the exponential growth (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 1), and at the beginning of the 2-h growth arrest (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 2). This Northern result indicated that the ilvIH operon is indeed activated during growth stress (2-h growth arrest). The transcriptional activity of the ilvIH operon is expected to subsequently activate the leuO gene via the promoter relay mechanism (11Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29929-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The co-detection of ilvIH and leuO mRNAs during the 2-h growth arrest can best be explained by the promoter relay mechanism. Therefore, we expected that the deletion of ilvIH promoter activity would also abolish the activity of the leuO gene under the same experimental condition (MC4100 cells under the starvation for b-caa). Hence, the ilvIH transcription activity-dependent activation of leuO was tested using a pair of multicopy plasmids, pWU204 and pWU205, that both carry the E. coli promoter relay DNA sequence (NCBI GenBank/EBI data bank accession number AF106955). These two plasmids are identical except that the ilvIH promoter (–10 sequences of ilvIH operon) has been deleted from the E. coli promoter relay DNA sequence on pWU205, whereas the promoter of the ilvIH operon on pWU204 remains intact (Fig. 1). The plasmids were tested in MC4100 cells grown in 17-amino acid SSA for the activation of the ilvIH promoter in response to the starvation for b-caa (Fig. 1, D and E). By using a primer extension study, ilvIH promoter activity was detectable on pWU204 (Fig. 1D, lane 1). Under the same testing condition, ilvIH promoter activity was not detectable on pWU205, the ilvIH promoter-less plasmid (Fig. 1D, lane 2). The activity of the promoter of the β-lactamase gene (bla) was simultaneously monitored as an internal control in the primer extension studies (Fig. 1D) and found to be identical. This internal control clearly shows that the different ilvIH promoter activities on pWU204 and pWU205 are not due to copy number differences between the two testing plasmids. Further primer extension studies (Fig. 1E) demonstrated that the ilvIH promoter activity is required for activation of the leuO gene. In the presence of the intact ilvIH promoter, the leuO promoter activity was detectable on pWU204 (Fig. 1E, lane 3). In contrast, because of the lack of ilvIH promoter activity on pWU205, the identical leuO gene on that plasmid failed to be activated (Fig. 1E, lane 4). These data clearly support a promoter relay mechanism for the activation of the leuO gene at the ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene locus in E. coli. The Promoter Relay Mechanism Is Regulated by Cis-elements with Little DNA Sequence Specificity—Two cis-elements that are important for the promoter relay mechanism, the 47-bp repression element AT8 and the 25-bp derepression element AT7, were identified in the S. typhimurium ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster (14Chen C.C.

https://openalex.org/W1977881358,"The interaction of thrombin with protein C triggers a key down-regulatory process of the coagulation cascade. Using a panel of 77 Ala mutants, we have mapped the epitope of thrombin recognizing protein C in the absence or presence of the cofactor thrombomodulin. Residues around the Na(+) site (Thr-172, Lys-224, Tyr-225, and Gly-226), the aryl binding site (Tyr-60a), the primary specificity pocket (Asp-189), and the oxyanion hole (Gly-193) hold most of the favorable contributions to protein C recognition by thrombin, whereas a patch of residues in the 30-loop (Arg-35 and Pro-37) and 60-loop (Phe-60h) regions produces unfavorable contributions to binding. The shape of the epitope changes drastically in the presence of thrombomodulin. The unfavorable contributions to binding disappear and the number of residues promoting the thrombin-protein C interaction is reduced to Tyr-60a and Asp-189. Kinetic studies of protein C activation as a function of temperature reveal that thrombomodulin increases >1,000-fold the rate of diffusion of protein C into the thrombin active site and lowers the activation barrier for this process by 4 kcal/mol. We propose that the mechanism of thrombomodulin action is to kinetically facilitate the productive encounter of thrombin and protein C and to allosterically change the conformation of the activation peptide of protein C for optimal presentation to the thrombin active site."
https://openalex.org/W1984747036,"2-Nitropropane dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.32) catalyzes the oxidation of nitroalkanes into their corresponding carbonyl compounds and nitrite. In this study, the ncd-2 gene encoding for the enzyme in Neurospora crassa was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and the resulting enzyme was purified. Size exclusion chromatography, heat denaturation, and mass spectroscopic analyses showed that 2-nitropropane dioxygenase is a homodimer of 80 kDa, containing a mole of non-covalently bound FMN per mole of subunit, and is devoid of iron. With neutral nitroalkanes and anionic nitronates other than propyl-1- and propyl-2-nitronate, for which a non-enzymatic free radical reaction involving superoxide was established using superoxide dismutase, substrate oxidation occurs within the enzyme active site. The enzyme was more specific for nitronates than nitroalkanes, as suggested by the second order rate constant kcat/Km determined with 2-nitropropane and primary nitroalkanes with alkyl chain lengths between 2 and 6 carbons. The steady state kinetic mechanism with 2-nitropropane, nitroethane, nitrobutane, and nitrohexane, in either the neutral or anionic form, was determined to be sequential, consistent with oxygen reacting with a reduced form of enzyme before release of the carbonyl product. Enzyme-monitored turnover with ethyl nitronate as substrate indicated that the catalytically relevant reduced form of enzyme is an anionic flavin semiquinone, whose formation requires the substrate, but not molecular oxygen, as suggested by anaerobic substrate reduction with nitroethane or ethyl nitronate. Substrate deuterium kinetic isotope effects with 1,2-[2H4]nitroethane and 1,1,2-[2H3 ethyl nitronate at pH 8 yielded normal and inverse effects on the kcat/Km value, respectively, and were negligible on the kcat value. The kcat/Km and kcat pH profiles with anionic nitronates showed the requirement of an acid, whereas those for neutral nitroalkanes were consistent with the involvement of both an acid and a base in catalysis. The kinetic data reported herein are consistent with an oxidasestyle catalytic mechanism for 2-nitropropane dioxygenase, in which the flavin-mediated oxidation of the anionic nitronates or neutral nitroalkanes and the subsequent oxidation of the enzyme-bound flavin occur in two independent steps. 2-Nitropropane dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.32) catalyzes the oxidation of nitroalkanes into their corresponding carbonyl compounds and nitrite.

The enzyme was first characterized by Little (1Little H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 347-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 1951 as an oxidase, but was later classified as a dioxygenase based on the observation that the oxygen atom of the organic product formed upon oxidation of propyl-2-nitronate originates from molecular oxygen and not from water (2Gorlatova N. Tchorzewski M. Kurihara T. Soda K. Esaki N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, 2-nitropropane dioxygenase has been isolated from N. crassa (1Little H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 347-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Hansenula mrakii (3Tchorzewski M. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Whereas the two enzymes have similar molecular weights of about 40,000, they differ in their prosthetic group content in that FMN and FAD are found in the N. crassa and H. mrakii enzymes, respectively (2Gorlatova N. Tchorzewski M. Kurihara T. Soda K. Esaki N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kido T. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 226-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A study on the enzymatic oxidation of nitroalkanes by 2-nitropropane dioxygenase is of considerable interest for both applied and fundamental reasons. Because of the low pKa values for deprotonation of the α-carbon (Scheme 1) (5Nielsen A.T. Feuer H. The Chemistry of the Nitro and Nitroso Groups. 1. Interscience Publishers, New York1969: 349-486Google Scholar), nitroalkanes are widely used in industry because they provide a quick and effective method of synthesizing common reagents (6Ballini R. Barboni L. Giarlo G. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 9173-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Hanessian S. Pham V. Org.

However many are anticipated to be toxic and some have been demonstrated to be carcinogenic (9Davis R. Clayton G. Clayton F. Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1993Google Scholar, 10Sittig M. Handbook of Toxic and Hazardous Chemicals and Carcinogens. 2nd Ed.

Hussain N.S. Fiala E.S. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3143-3147PubMed Google Scholar). 2-Nitropropane, for example, has been shown to cause the formation of both 8-hydroxy- and 8-amino-guanine in the DNA and RNA of liver cells in Sprague Dawley rats (16Sakano K. Oikawa S. Murata M. Hiraku Y. Kojima N. Kawanishi S. Mutat. Res. 2001; 479: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enzymatic oxidation of nitroalkanes into less toxic species can therefore be exploited for use in bioremediation. The oxidation of nitroalkanes has been observed to occur physiologically in N. crassa (1Little H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 347-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), H. mrakii (17Kido T. Soda K. Suzuki T. Asada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6994-7000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Fusarium oxysporum (18Kido T. Hashizume K. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however the implications of the reaction in biological systems are not yet fully understood. Consequently, a characterization of the biochemical and mechanistic properties of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase might shed light on the role of nitroalkane oxidation by living organisms. From a mechanistic standpoint, 2-nitropropane dioxygenase is unique in that it can effectively utilize both the neutral (nitroalkane) and anionic (nitronate) forms of the nitroalkane substrate (2Gorlatova N. Tchorzewski M. Kurihara T. Soda K. Esaki N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the numerous reported studies on the enzymatic oxidation of nitroalkanes catalyzed by flavin-dependent enzymes have only characterized the reaction using a single form of substrate (19Porter D.J. Voet J.G. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4400-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Porter D.J. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4361-4370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, 2-nitropropane dioxygenase offers the unique opportunity for a direct comparison of the enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of nitroalkanes in their neutral and anionic forms. To date, because of the limited amount of enzyme that can be obtained in a pure form upon extraction from natural sources, minimal biochemical, structural, or mechanistic information is available on 2-nitropropane dioxygenase. In this study, the ncd-2 gene encoding for 2-nitropropane dioxygenase was cloned into the expression vector pET20b(+), expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) cells, and the resultant enzyme was characterized in its kinetic and biochemical properties. The data presented herein indicate that the enzymatic oxidation of neutral nitroalkanes and anionic nitronates catalyzed by 2-nitropropane dioxygenase occurs through an oxidase-style catalytic mechanism in which the flavin-mediated oxidation of the substrate and the subsequent oxidation of the enzyme-bound flavin occur in two independent steps. Evidence is presented that the enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of the nitroalkane substrate involves the unusual formation of an anionic flavin semiquinone species as a catalytic intermediate. Materials—The plasmid pUCncd containing the ncd-2 gene encoding for 2-nitropropane dioxygenase in N. crassa was a generous gift from Drs. Nobuyoshi Esaki and Tatsuo Kurihara, Kyoto University, Japan. Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. Restriction endonucleases NdeI and EcoRI, T4 DNA ligase, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were from Promega. DNase I and the Rapid DNA ligation kit were from Roche Applied Science. Luria-Bertani agar and broth, ampicillin, FMN, phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, superoxide dismutase, lysozyme, and nitroalkanes were from Sigma-Aldrich. Ammonium sulfate and MgCl2 were from ICN Biomedicals. EDTA was from Fisher. The plasmid vector pET20b(+) was from Novagen. Primers and products derived from primer extension amplification were purified using mini kits from Qiagen. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used for protein expression, and the strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used during cloning procedures. Both strains were stored at –80 °C as 7% dimethyl sulfoxide suspensions. The Hi-Prep 16/10 Octyl Fast Flow column and the DEAE-Sepharose used in packing the DEAE column were from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Instruments—DNA sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems Big Dye kit on an Applied Biosystems model ABI 377 DNA sequencer at the DNA Core Facility of the Biology Department of Georgia State University. Oligonucleotides were custom synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 380B DNA Synthesizer by the Gene Technology Laboratory of the Biology Department of Texas A&M University, College Station. UV-visible absorbance spectra were recorded using an Agilent Technologies diode-array spectrophotometer Model HP 8453, equipped with a thermostatted water bath. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu Spectrofluorometer Model RF-5301 PC, thermostatted at 15 °C. MALDI-TOF 1The abbreviation used is: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight. spectra were recorded using an ABI Voyager DE-pro mass spectrophotometer. Stopped flow experiments were carried out using a Hi-Tech SF-61 Double Mixing Stopped Flow system. Cloning of ncd-2 into pET20b(+)—Plasmid pUCncd containing the ncd-2 gene for 2-nitropropane dioxygenase was used directly to transform E. coli strain XL1-Blue competent cells, using the heat shock method of Inoue et al. (22Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar), and the pUCncd plasmid was isolated through a QIAquick Spin miniprep kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted pUCncd plasmid was used as a DNA template for primer extension amplification of the ncd-2 gene, using oligonucleotide sense and antisense primers containing NdeI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease sites designed to anneal to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene, respectively. The engineered NdeI (CGAGTACATATGACTTCCCAGGCCACAGC) and EcoRI (TCACCGAATTCTACACGCGGCACCCCTTAGGC) restriction sites (underlined) were designed to facilitate directional cloning into the corresponding sites in pET20b(+). The ncd-2 gene was ligated into pET20b(+) to construct plasmid pET/2NPDnc using a Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche Applied Science), and the ligation mixture was used directly to transform E. coli strain XL1-Blue competent cells. The correct construct was sequenced in both directions using oligonucleotide primers designed to bind to the DNA regions of pET flanking the inserted gene and was used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3) competent cells for protein expression. Purification of 2-Nitropropane Dioxygenase—E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells harboring plasmid pET/2NPDnc were used to inoculate 5 × 1.25 liters of Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and the cultures were incubated for ∼15 h at 30 °C. The temperature was then lowered to 22 °C, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 17 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and were resuspended with 4 volumes of 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 5 μg/ml DNase I, and 10 mm MgCl2, in 50 mm Tris-Cl at pH 8, before sonication and collection of the cell-free extract by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 25 min. After 70% ammonium sulfate saturation and centrifugation, the resultant pellet was dialyzed against 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and was loaded onto a DEAE Fast Flow column (4 × 30 cm) connected to an Åkta prime Amersham Biosciences Biotech system equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 80 mm ammonium sulfate developed over 2 liters at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Catalytically active fractions, typically eluting at ∼35 mm ammonium sulfate, were pooled and adjusted to a final concentration of 1.5 m ammonium sulfate before loading directly onto a Hi-Prep 16/10 Octyl Fast Flow column (3.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 1.5 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Protein elution was carried out with a linear gradient from 1.5 to 0 m ammonium sulfate over 200 ml at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions of the highest purity were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and stored at –20 °C until use. The purified enzyme was found to be stable upon storage under these conditions for at least 6 months. Biochemical Methods—The concentration of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase was determined with the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar), using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard. The molecular weight of the enzyme under non-denaturing conditions was determined by size exclusion chromatography through a Sephacryl S-400 column (1 × 50 cm) connected to an Åkta prime system equilibrated with 300 mm KCl in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The following proteins were used as standards: horse heart cytochrome c (12,400), bovine serum albumin (66,000), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150,000), sweet potato β-amylase (200,000) and horse spleen apoferritin (443,000). For denaturation experiments aimed at the determination of flavin to protein stoichiometry, ∼40 μm of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase was incubated at 100 °C for 30 min, followed by removal of precipitated protein by centrifugation. The flavin content per monomer of enzyme was calculated from the ratio of the concentration of flavin released from the enzyme, using an ϵ455 nm value of 12,500 m–1 cm–1 (24Whitby L.G. Biochem. J. 1953; 54: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), to the concentration of protein determined by the Bradford assay. Identification of the flavin cofactor of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase was determined through MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode using a 50:50 methanol/acetonitrile matrix. Samples were prepared by denaturing the enzyme with 10% trichloroacetic acid, followed by centrifugation and collection of the supernatant. Determination of the iron content of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase was carried out by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopic analysis at the Chemical Analysis Facility of the University of Georgia. Spectral Studies—The molar extinction coefficient of the flavin cofactor was determined by following the change in UV-visible absorbance at 444 nm of the enzyme at pH 8, before and after incubation at 100 °C for 30 min and centrifugation to remove precipitated protein. Reduced flavin was obtained through anaerobic photoreduction of the enzyme in the presence of 15 mm EDTA using a 100 watt light bulb. The anionic semiquinone of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase was prepared through anaerobic reduction of the enzyme with 0.78 mm ethyl nitronate or nitroethane at 15 °C. Samples were made anaerobic by repeated cycles of vacuuming and flushing with ultra-pure argon in an anaerobic cuvette equipped with two side arms. The organic substrate was loaded into one side arm and was mixed with enzyme after the cuvette was devoid of oxygen. Enzyme Kinetics—Enzymatic activity was measured with the method of initial rates (25Allison R.D. Purich D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in air-saturated 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, by monitoring the rate of oxygen consumption with a computer-interfaced Oxy-32 oxygen-monitoring system (Hansatech Instrument Ltd.) thermostatted at 30 °C. Enzyme concentration was expressed per enzyme bound FMN content, using the experimentally determined ϵ444 nm value of 11,850 m–1 cm–1. Stock solutions of nitroalkane substrates were prepared in 100% ethanol; the final concentration of ethanol in each assay mixture was kept constant at 1% to minimize possible effects on enzymatic activity. Alkyl nitronates were prepared as described above, except that the nitroalkane solution was allowed to react for 24 h at room temperature, with a 1.2 molar excess of KOH. Enzymatic assays were initiated by the addition of substrate, in order to minimize changes in the ionization state of the nitroalkane. 2The second-order rate constants for deprotonation of the nitroalkanes used in the present study have values comprised between 5 and 6 m–1 s–1 (48Gadda G. Choe D.Y. Fitzpatrick P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), ensuring that in assays initiated with fully protonated nitroalkanes a negligible amount of anionic substrate is present during the time required to determine initial rates (typically ∼30 s). Similarly, the second-order rate constants for protonation of alkyl nitronates have values in the 15–75 m–1 s–1 range (5Nielsen A.T. Feuer H. The Chemistry of the Nitro and Nitroso Groups. 1. Interscience Publishers, New York1969: 349-486Google Scholar), ensuring a negligible amount of neutral substrate in assays initiated with fully unprotonated alkyl nitronates. When both the organic substrate and oxygen were varied, the assay mixtures were equilibrated with the appropriate O2/N2 gas mixture by bubbling the gas for at least 10 min, before the reaction was started with the addition of the enzyme and the organic substrate. When the pH was varied, 50 mm sodium phosphate was used as a buffer between pH 6 and 9.5. Deuterium substrate kinetic isotope effects were determined using 1,2-[2H4]nitroethane or 1,2,2-[2H3]ethyl nitronate as substrate in air-saturated 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8. Activity assays were carried out by alternating substrate isoptomers. The presence of superoxide during turnover of the enzyme with different nitroalkane substrates was monitored by measuring the rate of oxygen consumption at a fixed concentration of substrate in either the presence or absence of 125 units of superoxide dismutase, in air-saturated 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8 at 30 °C. Production of hydrogen peroxide during turnover was monitored by measuring the rate of oxygen consumption at a fixed concentration of substrate, in either the presence or absence of 75 units of catalase. Stopped Flow Analysis of 2-Nitropropane Dioxygenase in Turnover— 2-Nitropropane dioxygenase was mixed with ethyl nitronate at a final concentration of 5 mm in 50 mm potassium phosphate and 1% ethanol, pH 7.4, in a stopped flow spectrophotometer thermostatted at 15 °C. Traces were recorded for 60 s, while following the reaction at 370 and 445 nm. Spectra of the enzyme in turnover with substrate were obtained by following absorbance changes at a single wavelength between 300 and 600 nm at 10-nm intervals and plotting the absorbance versus wavelength for any given time. Data Analysis—Data were fit with KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) or Enzfitter software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Kinetic parameters determined in atmospheric oxygen were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation for one substrate. When initial rates of reaction were determined by varying the concentrations of both the nitroalkane substrate and oxygen, the data were fit to Equations 1 and 2, which describe a sequential and ping-pong steady state kinetic mechanism, respectively. Ka and Kb represent the Michaelis constants for the nitroalkane substrate (A) and oxygen (B), respectively and kcat is the turnover number of the enzyme (e). The pH dependence of the steady state kinetic parameters was determined by fitting initial rate data obtained at varying concentrations of organic substrate to Equations 3 and 4, which describe a bell-shaped curve with a slope of +1 at low pH and a slope of –1 at high pH, and a curve with a slope of –1 and a plateau region at low pH, respectively. C is the pH independent value of the kinetic parameter of interest. Substrate deuterium kinetic isotope effects were determined by fitting the data to Equation 5, which describes isotope effects on kcat and kcat/Km. Fi is the atom fraction of deuterium label in the substrate and Ecat and Ekcat/K are the isotope effects minus one on kcat and kcat/Km, respectively. ve=kcatABKaB+KbA+AB+KiaKb(Eq. 1) ve=kcatABKaB+KbA+AB(Eq. 2) log Y=log(C1+10−pH10−pKa1+10−pKa210−pH)(Eq. 3) log Y=log(C1+10−pKa210−pH)(Eq. 4) ve=kcatAKm(1+Fi×Ekcat/K)+A(1+Fi×Ekcat)(Eq. 5) Expression and Purification of 2-Nitropropane Dioxygenase—One of the most critical impediments for a detailed biochemical and mechanistic investigation of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase to date has been a lack of an efficient and rapid method for the obtainment of large amounts of purified enzyme. Indeed, an earlier study reported that 2 mg of purified enzyme could be obtained in five chromatographic steps from a 100-liter liquid culture of N. crassa cells (2Gorlatova N. Tchorzewski M. Kurihara T. Soda K. Esaki N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the previously identified ncd-2 gene encoding for 2-nitropropane dioxygenase form N. crassa was PCR-cloned in the expression vector pET20b(+). After the successful construction of the resulting pET/2NPDnc plasmid was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis, 2-nitropropane dioxygenase was expressed in large amounts (∼15% of the total protein content) in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) upon incubation with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 17 h at 21 °C. 2-Nitropropane dioxygenase was then purified to high levels, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1), with two chromatographic steps onto DEAE-Sepharose and Octyl-Sepharose columns. As shown in Table I for a representative purification of the enzyme, 34 mg of recombinant 2-nitropropane dioxygenase could be obtained from 6.25 liters of bacterial cell culture, corresponding to a ∼300-fold increase in the amount of purified enzyme per liter of culture as compared with the procedure employing N. crassa cells (2Gorlatova N. Tchorzewski M. Kurihara T. Soda K. Esaki N. Appl. Environ.

XP_323268), a molecular weight of 40,000 was determined under denaturing conditions from an SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme (Fig. 1). Size exclusion chromatography under non-denaturing conditions of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase, at a concentration of 45 μm, yielded a single peak with an apparent molecular weight of 80,000 (data not shown), consistent with a dimeric oligomerization state for the enzyme in solution. The non-covalently bound flavin cofactor of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase was determined to be FMN, based on the peak with an m/z– value of 455.1 seen in the MALDI-TOF spectrum of the flavin released upon denaturation of the enzyme followed by centrifugation to remove the precipitated protein (Fig. 2). A stoichiometry of 0.84 ± 0.23 FMN per monomer of enzyme could be calculated from the ratio of the concentration of flavin released after heat treatment of the enzyme to the concentration of enzyme determined by the Bradford assay. An iron content of 0.02 per monomer of enzyme was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopic analysis of the purified enzyme, consistent with negligible iron content in 2-nitropropane dioxygenase (data not shown). These data indicate that recombinant 2-nitropropane dioxygenase expressed in the heterologous bacterial system has the same oligomerization state and flavin content 3Earlier studies identified the prosthetic group of N. crassa 2-nitropropane dioxygenase as FMN, based on reverse-phase HPLC analysis of the flavin extracted by heat treatment of the enzyme (2Gorlatova N.

In that same study, it was reported that the quantitative analysis revealed the presence of 2 mol of flavin per mol of subunit, although the experimental procedure used in the determination was not reported.

The STtyr isoform is transiently localized in the Golgi and is ultimately cleaved and secreted, whereas the STcys isoform is stably localized in the Golgi and is not cleaved and secreted. The stable localization of STcys is correlated with its enhanced ability to oligomerize. To test the hypothesis that multiple signals can mediate Golgi localization and further evaluate the role of oligomerization in the localization process, we evaluated the effects of individually and simultaneously altering the cytosolic tail and transmembrane region of the STcys isoform. We found that the localization, processing, and oligomerization of STcys were not substantially changed when either the core amino acids of the cytosolic tail were deleted or the sequence and length of the transmembrane region were altered. In contrast, when these changes were made simultaneously, the STcys isoform was converted into a form that was processed, secreted, and weakly oligomerized like STtyr. We propose that STcys oligomerization is a secondary event resulting from its concentration in the Golgi via mechanisms independently mediated by its cytosolic tail and transmembrane region.

The glycan structures that modify proteins and lipids play a variety of roles during development, in the normal adult animal, and in various disease states (for review see Ref. 1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4987) Google Scholar). The enzymes that add the terminal monosaccharides to both O-linked and N-linked glycans reside in the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus in an overlapping pattern that reflects the order in which they act on the growing carbohydrate structures. This pattern of glycosyltransferase localization allows the access of these enzymes to their sugar nucleotide donors, which are transported from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen by specific transporters, and their glycoconjugate substrates, which are generated in the same or earlier cisternae. Experimental manipulation of glycosyltransferase compartmentalization disrupts the access of enzymes to their donors and substrates and alters the glycan structures synthesized by a cell (2Osman N.

These observations highlight the importance of the sequential location of glycosylation enzymes throughout the Golgi apparatus for the efficient and accurate biosynthesis of cellular glycoconjugates. ST6Gal I 1The abbreviations used are: ST6Gal I, α2,6-sialyltransferase; STcys and STtyr, isoforms of the ST6Gal I; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GnTI and GnTII, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases I and II; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is an α2,6-sialyltransferase that adds terminal α2,6-linked sialic acid to N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins (4Paulson J.C. Prieels J.-P. Glasgow L.R. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5617-5624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme has been localized to the trans-Golgi and the trans-Golgi network of hepatocytes (5Roth J. Taatjes D.J. Lucoq J.M. Weinstein J. Paulson J.C. Cell. 1985; 43: 287-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and in post-Golgi compartments in other cells (see Ref. 6Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar for additional references). Like other glycosyltransferases, the ST6Gal I is also found as a soluble form in various body fluids such as colostrum and serum (for a review, see Ref. 6Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The ST6Gal I has previously been shown to exist as two naturally occurring isoforms that differ by one amino acid at position 123 in the catalytic domain (7Ma J. Qian R. Rausa F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This amino acid change, from Tyr to Cys, is the result of a single A to G nucleotide change. The STtyr isoform is encoded by genomic DNA, whereas both the STtyr and the STcys isoforms are encoded by liver RNA, suggesting that the STcys RNA is generated by an RNA-editing event (7Ma J. Qian R. Rausa F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the single amino acid change in the enzyme catalytic domain does not significantly impact the catalytic activity of the two ST6Gal I isoforms (8Chen T.-L.L. Chen C. Bergeron N.Q. Close B.E. Bohrer T. Vertel B.M. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Instead, the STtyr and the STcys isoforms show dramatic differences in their trafficking and localization. The STtyr isoform is transiently localized in the Golgi, cleaved in a post-Golgi compartment, and secreted from COS-1 cells with a half-time of ∼6 h (7Ma J. Qian R. Rausa F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, STcys is more stably localized in the Golgi, and is not rapidly cleaved and secreted, but is found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when highly expressed (7Ma J. Qian R. Rausa F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Chen T.-L.L. Chen C. Bergeron N.Q. Close B.E. Bohrer T. Vertel B.M. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The stable Golgi localization of the STcys isoform is correlated with its ability to form pH-dependent, insoluble oligomers (9Chen C. Ma J. Lazic A. Backovic M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13819-13826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We found that, although the majority of the STcys isoform is recovered as insoluble oligomers at pH 6.3, the pH of the late Golgi, less than 20% of STtyr was found as insoluble oligomers under these conditions (9Chen C. Ma J. Lazic A. Backovic M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13819-13826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the single amino acid difference in the catalytic domain of the ST6Gal I isoforms leads to subtle differences in the conformation of this region that allow the STcys isoform to form more stable oligomers than the STtyr isoform. This in turn correlates with the differences in the efficiency of Golgi localization of the two proteins. There are currently two models for the transit of cargo proteins through the Golgi that also offer differing views of Golgi protein localization. In the vesicular transport model originally proposed by Rothman and colleagues (10Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1997; 272: 227-234Crossref Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 11Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), resident proteins such as glycosyltransferases, are stably localized (retained) in the Golgi cisternae, whereas the cargo proteins (those that are destined for the plasma membrane, secretory vesicles, and lysosomes) are transported in an anterograde direction to each successive cisterna in small COPI-coated vesicles. In the context of this model, Golgi proteins were envisioned to be retained via a membrane partitioning (bilayer thickness) mechanism or by microenvironment specific oligomerization. The bilayer thickness model proposed by Bretscher and Munro (12Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) suggested that Golgi proteins, by virtue of their relatively short transmembrane regions, are unable to partition into transport vesicles destined for later compartments with “wider” membranes that are rich in cholesterol. Although other laboratories provided evidence for this model (13Masibay A.S. Balaji P.J. Boeggeman E.E. Quasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9906-9916Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 14Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), we found that increasing the length of the 17-amino acid transmembrane region of either ST6Gal I isoform did not enhance their Golgi exit (15Dahdal R.Y. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26310-26319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, other investigators (16Machamer C.E.

Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) proposed that, in the microenvironment of a particular Golgi cisterna, resident proteins form insoluble and/or very large homo- or hetero-oligomers that prevent their movement into adjacent compartments. The oligomerization of Golgi enzymes has been demonstrated by various laboratories, and in some cases, enzyme oligomerization is correlated with the localization of specific glycosyltransferases (9Chen C.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4935-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this transport model, proteins exit the ER in COPII-coated vesicles and fuse with, or coalesce to form, a vesicular tubular compartment or ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. At the same time, resident cis-Golgi proteins, including cis-Golgi glycosylation enzymes, are transported in a retrograde fashion in either COPI-coated vesicles or other types of carriers, such as tubules (20Opat A.S. Houghton F. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11836-11845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), from the cis-Golgi cisternae to this compartment. The net result of this coordinated anterograde transport of cargo and retrograde transport of cis-Golgi enzymes is the creation of a new cis-Golgi cisterna, the contents of which are progressively matured by the retrograde transport and introduction of medial Golgi enzymes and then trans-Golgi enzymes from more mature cisternae. In cisternal maturation model, the localization of Golgi enzymes is maintained by continuous retrograde transport, in contrast to the retention of enzymes predicted by the vesicular transport model. As evidence accumulates in support of the cisternal maturation model, the role of lipid partitioning and oligomerization need to be reconsidered in these contexts, and other possibilities examined. In particular, the possibility that the cytosolic sequences of Golgi proteins may mediate incorporation into retrograde transport carriers via their interactions with cytosolic coat proteins, is worthy of investigation. Interestingly, while enzyme transmembrane regions are required for the Golgi localization of all glycosyltransferases studied to date (6Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 18Opat A.S. van Viet C. Gleeson P.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Munro S.

Our early studies did not support a role for the ST6Gal I cytosolic tail in its Golgi localization but, rather, suggested important roles for the transmembrane and luminal sequences of the enzyme (15Dahdal R.Y. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26310-26319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7784-7793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of chimeric proteins demonstrated that the ST6Gal I cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane region were able to only transiently localize reporter sequences in the Golgi, and this contrasted with the more stable localization of STcys (15Dahdal R.Y. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26310-26319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7784-7793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations raised the possibility that Golgi localization is mediated by different simultaneously acting signals and mechanisms. We pursued the current studies in an effort to evaluate the possibility that multiple regions of the ST6Gal I isoforms can independently mediate Golgi localization and to re-evaluate the role of the cytosolic tail and enzyme oligomerization in this process. Our data demonstrate that the cytosolic tail and transmembrane region of the ST6Gal I both play roles in Golgi localization and that the ability of STcys to form pH-dependent, insoluble oligomers is compromised only when both the cytosolic tail and transmembrane region are altered. These data strongly suggest that oligomerization of the STcys isoform is a secondary event that occurs only after the enzyme is concentrated in the Golgi by mechanisms that involve its transmembrane region and cytosolic tail.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26310-26319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cDNA constructs in the pSVL vector were used as templates for PCR construction of Δtail SA23-pSVL cDNAs of both ST6Gal I isoforms. The ΔtailSA23 mutants of both isoforms were amplified from their SA23-pSVL cDNAs using the 5′ primer 5′-GCT CTA GAT GAA GAA AAA GAT CTT AAC C-3′ and the general 3′-pSVL primer 5′-GGG GTA CCG GTT TAG AGC AGA AG-3′. In these constructions, the 5′ primer used for amplification effectively deletes amino acids 2–6 of the cytoplasmic tail to leave Met-Lys-Lys-Lys at the amino terminus and introduces a XbaI site in the 5′-untranslated region. The products were digested with XbaI and SstI (found in the original pSVL polylinker region) and recloned into the pSVL vector cut with the same enzymes. The tail deletion mutant for STtyr was generated by digesting the existing STcys Δtail-pSVL cDNA and wild type STtyr-pSVL with BglII and inserting the portion of the catalytic region of STtyr (containing the one amino acid change) into the STcys Δtail-pSVL construct. To generate stably expressing cell lines, the STtyr and STtyr Δtail SA23 were cloned into the pCIneo vector (Promega Corp.). Coding sequences were amplified by PCR from the corresponding pSVL constructs. For STtyr, 5′-CGC TCG AGA TGA TTC ATA CCA AC-3′ was used as the 5′ primer and generated a XhoI site in the 5′-untranslated region, whereas 5′-CCT CTA GAT CAA CAA CGA ATG TTC CG-3′ was used as the 3′ primer and generated a XbaI site in the 3′-untranslated region. The STtyr coding sequence was inserted into pCIneo using the XhoI and XbaI sites in the plasmid. For the STtyr Δtail SA23, 5′-GCT CTA GAT GAA GAA AAA GAT CTT AAC C-3′ was used as the 5′ primer and 5′-GAC TCT AGA TCA ACA ACG AAT GTT-3′ was used as the 3′ primer. These primers generated XbaI sites on both the 5′ and 3′ ends. The STtyr Δtail SA23 sequence was cloned into the pCIneo vector using the XbaI site in the polylinker. All sequences were confirmed by Sequenase 2.0 DNA sequencing. Transfection of COS-1 Cells—COS-1 cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and grown in a 37°, 5% CO2 incubator until 50–70% confluent in 100-mm tissue culture dishes or in 24-well plates containing 12-mm glass coverslips. Lipofectin transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 30 μl of Lipofectin and 20 μg of DNA were incubated separately in 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM in polystyrene culture tubes at room temperature for 35 min. They were then mixed together and then incubated for another 15 min at room temperature. The transfection mixtures were then added to cells washed with 2 × 5 ml of Opti-MEM. The cells were then incubated in the 37° C, 5% CO2 incubator for 6 h, and then 4 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS was added to the plates and the incubation continued for another 16 h. For coverslip transfections, 0.5 μg of DNA and 3 μl of Lipofectin were used in 150 μl of Opti-MEM per coverslip. Immunofluorescence Localization of ST6GalI Mutants—COS-1 cells were plated on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with the ST6Gal I cDNA expression constructs, as described above. 16–20 h post-transfection, the cells were stained as described previously (7Ma J. Qian R. Rausa F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For immunolocalization of ST6Gal I and its mutants, cells were fixed for 8 min in –20 °C methanol for staining of internal structures. Cells were washed with 2 × 1 ml PBS, blocked for 1 h with 5% goat serum in PBS, and incubated with a 1:100 dilution of an affinity-purified rabbit anti-ST6Gal I antibody in 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 h. After again washing the coverslips with PBS (4 × 1 ml), the cells were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. The cells were washed a second time with in PBS (4 × 1 ml) washes and mounted on glass slides using 20 μl of mounting media (15% (w/v) Vinol 205 polyvinyl alcohol, 33% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% sodium azide, pH 8.5, in PBS). Cells were visualized and photographed using a Leica DMRB microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu charge-coupled device camera driven by the OpenLab imaging program (Improvision, Coventry, England). Generation of Cell Lines Stably Expressing ST6Gal I Proteins—HeLa cell lines stably expressing the STtyr and STtyrΔtailSA23 proteins were generated. The STtyr-pCIneo and STtyrΔtailSA23-pCIneo were linearized using the BamHI site in the vector and transfected into HeLa cells using Fugene6 lipid-mediated transfection according to the manufacturer's procedure. After 24 h, the cells were passaged 1:4 into DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 500 μg/ml Geneticin. Cells were grown in selective media for 2 weeks, and then clones were isolated and analyzed for stable protein expression by immunofluorescence microscopy (see above) and immunoblotting (38Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling of Cells—16–20 h following transfection, cells were incubated with 10 ml of cysteine/methionine-free DMEM for 1 h. After incubation, the media was replaced with 4 ml of fresh cysteine/methionine-free DMEM containing 100 μCi/ml 35S-Express protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were radiolabeled for 1 h in a 37° C, 5% CO2 incubator. After labeling, medium was removed, and the labeled cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS and chased for the indicated times in 4 ml of unlabeled DMEM, 10% FBS. The medium was collected at the end of the chase, the cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS, and then lysed with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS). Cell lysates and media samples were stored at –20 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitation of ST6Gal I—ST6Gal I isoforms and mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and the media using 5 μl of the purified rabbit anti-ST6Gal I antibody and protein A-Sepharose, as described previously (7Ma J. Qian R. Rausa F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 10 min, and the entire sample, including Sepharose beads, was directly loaded into the gel well. The proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography using 10% 2,5-diphenyloxalzole in Me2SO, and gels were exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film at –80 °C. pH-dependent Oligomerization Assay—The pH-dependent insolubility assay is based on the protocol of Schweizer et al. (39Schweizer A. Rohrer J. Hauri H.-P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Golgi-enriched membranes were isolated according to the method of Xu and Shields (40Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Membranes were centrifuged for 1 h at 39,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor and solubilized with the pH 6.3 or pH 8.0 MNT buffers (20 mm MES, 30 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm iodoacetamide, 1% Triton X-100). After a 30-min solubilization on ice, the lysates were transferred to a SW65 Ti (Beckman) ultracentrifuge tube, and MNT buffers of the proper pH were used to fill the tubes. Following a 1-h centrifugation in the SW65 Ti rotor at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, the pellets were solubilized in Laemmli buffer by sonication in a sonicating water bath for 5 min. The proteins in the supernatant were recovered by methanol precipitation. Briefly, four volumes of methanol were added to the samples, and the mixtures were stored at –20 °C overnight. The precipitated proteins were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 min, and the pellets were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer by sonication. The samples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by immunoblotting with an anti-ST6Gal I antibody. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (38Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol.

However, we found that changing both the length and the sequence of the transmembrane region of either ST6Gal I isoform did not change their trafficking or localization in the Golgi (9Chen C. Ma J.

These observations led us to question whether another region of the proteins was acting as an additional localization signal. If glycosylation enzymes are maintained in the Golgi by continuous retrograde transport, as predicted by the cisternal maturation model, then one would predict the cytosolic tails of the enzymes would mediate the clustering of enzymes into coated membrane regions prior to transport via interactions with cytosolic coat proteins. With this in mind, we considered the possibility that the cytosolic tail of the ST6Gal I was acting as a redundant signal for Golgi localization. Either the Cytosolic Tail or the Transmembrane Region,"
https://openalex.org/W2022597101,"Two fragments of the C-terminal tail of the α1 subunit (CT1, amino acids 1538–1692 and CT2, amino acids 1596–1692) of human cardiac L-type calcium channel (CaV1.2) have been expressed, refolded, and purified. A single Ca2+-calmodulin binds to each fragment, and this interaction with Ca2+-calmodulin is required for proper folding of the fragment. Ca2+-calmodulin, bound to these fragments, is in a more extended conformation than calmodulin bound to a synthetic peptide representing the IQ motif, suggesting that either the conformation of the IQ sequence is different in the context of the longer fragment, or other sequences within CT2 contribute to the binding of calmodulin. NMR amide chemical shift perturbation mapping shows the backbone conformation of calmodulin is nearly identical when bound to CT1 and CT2, suggesting that amino acids 1538–1595 do not contribute to or alter calmodulin binding to amino acids 1596–1692 of CaV1.2. The interaction with CT2 produces the greatest changes in the backbone amides of hydrophobic residues in the N-lobe and hydrophilic residues in the C-lobe of calmodulin and has a greater effect on residues located in Ca2+ binding loops I and II in the N-lobe relative to loops III and IV in the C-lobe.

CDI is the process whereby the entry of Ca2+ enhances channel closing during a maintained depolarization (15McDonald T.F. Pelzer S. Trautwein W. Pelzer D.J. Physiol.

A sequence designated the IQ motif is required for both CDI and CDF, but the precise roles of other neighboring sequences remain to be elucidated. Peterson et al. (22Peterson B.Z. Lee J.S. Mulle J.G.

Specifically, Peterson et al. (22Peterson B.Z. Lee J.S. Mulle J.G. Wang Y. de Leon M. Yue D.T. Biophys.

To complicate matters further, two other sequences (amino acids 1609–1628, designated A motif; amino acids 1627–1652, designated C or CB motif) between the EF hand and the IQ motif have also been implicated in CaM binding (1Pate P.

Additional data to define the CaM binding site on the C-terminal tail of the α1 subunit and to elucidate the mechanisms of CDI and CDF of CaV1.2 are needed. The molecular details of the interactions and the stoichiometry of this interaction remain to be determined. In this report, we describe the expression of fragments of the α1 subunit C-terminal domain and provide new details of its interaction with CaM. Materials—[15N]NH4Cl and d-[U-13C]glucose were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). 5-((((2-Iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (1,5-IAEDANS) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). N-(4-Dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide (DDPM) and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Peptides were synthesized in the core facility at Baylor College of Medicine under the direction of Dr. Richard Cook. Expression and Purification of CT1, CT2, Wild-type CaM, N-CaM, C-CaM, E12Q CaM, E34Q CaM, E1234Q CaM, and T34C/T110C CaM—We made two constructs of the C-terminal tail using the human CaV1.2 α1 subunit cDNA as a template. One construct codes for amino acids 1538–1692 (includes the EF hand regions and the A, C, and IQ motifs) and is designated CT1. A second construct codes for amino acids 1596–1692 (includes the A, C, and IQ motifs) and is designated CT2. We subcloned the cDNA of these sequences into pET23a(+) and pET28a(+) vectors (Novagen, Madison, WI) between NdeI and HindIII sites and used these constructs for the expression of the fragments with and without a His tag. We transformed the subcloned vectors into BL21(DE3) host (Novagen) for expression and grew the cells in LB media containing the suitable antibiotics at 37 °C. Cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an OD600 of 0.6 and incubated another 3 h at 37 °C before harvesting. The cells were lysed with lysozyme and nuclease and soluble material was removed by sedimentation of the insoluble material. The insoluble pellet was washed with urea and Triton X-100 to obtain an insoluble fraction enriched in inclusion body proteins. Wild-type CaM, N-CaM, and C-CaM were expressed and purified as described previously (25Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ binding site mutants of CaM (E12Q CaM, E34Q CaM, and E1234Q CaM) were expressed and purified as described previously (26Rodney G.G. Krol J. Williams B. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12430-12435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of T34C/T110C CaM (cysteine substitution for threonine at positions 34 and 110 of CaM) is the same as that of wild-type CaM. Refolding of CT1 (Amino Acids 1538–1692) and CT2 (Amino Acids 1596–1692)—The inclusion bodies were solubilized with Inclusion Body solubilization reagent (Pierce) and refolded by dialyzing against 90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 m urea, 6 mm calcium in the presence of CaM (wild-type CaM or CaM mutants). Water was added gradually to the dialysis buffer to lower the urea concentration to 2 m. The remaining urea was removed by dialysis against 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and 2 mm calcium. Soluble and insoluble proteins were then separated by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. His tags were removed using a Thrombin Cleavage Capture kit (Novagen). The refolding in the presence of CaM was also examined at three different Ca2+ concentrations. Preparation of CT1 for Analysis of CaM Binding by Nondenaturing Gel Electrophoresis—The untagged, solubilized CT1 was further purified using chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). To avoid CT1 precipitation, all buffers (equilibration, binding, wash, and elution buffer) included a 50% solution of the Inclusion Body solubilization reagent. CT1 was eluted with 10 mm imidazole. The purified CT1 was refolded by dialysis against 90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 m urea, 3% Triton X-100, gradually adding water into the dialysis buffer until 2 m urea was reached. At this stage CT1 was dialyzed against 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100. Increasing amounts of refolded CT1 were incubated with CaM (2 μg in 20 μl (6 μm) per sample) for 30 min at room temperature in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Nondenaturing PAGE (15%) was performed to assess complex formation of CT1 and CaM. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Preparation of CT1, CT2, and Donor/Acceptor-labeled CaM for Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—The purified complex of CT1 or CT2-CaM was obtained by refolding CT1 or CT2 in the presence of CaM. His tags were cleaved with thrombin. The samples were dialyzed against 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with EGTA to precipitate CT1 or CT2. The pellet was washed with 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, to obtain purified CT1 or CT2 (insoluble). Samples were solubilized in the Inclusion Body solubilization reagent. Donor/acceptor-labeled CaM (D/A CaM) was obtained by labeling T34C/T110C CaM with 1,5-IAEDANS (the donor) and DDPM (the acceptor). To obtain T34C/T110C that was only labeled with the donor, T34C/T110C CaM was labeled with 0.4 mol of donor/mol of protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl for 2 h at 20 °C in the dark. Free donor was removed by a desalting column packed with size exclusion medium, Bio-Gel P-6DG (Bio-Rad). The product had 0.31 mol of the donor per mol of protein. A portion of this partially labeled protein was saved as the donor-alone protein, while the rest was labeled with excess acceptor to give D/A CaM saturated by acceptor at the same reaction conditions. Free acceptor was removed by the same desalting column as above. FRET—D/A CaM (0.5 μm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of CT1, CT2, A-peptide, C-peptide, or IQ-peptide for 5 min at 20 °C in 20 mm MOPS pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, or 2 mm EGTA. Fluorescence data were collected on a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was set at 334 nm and emission spectra were scanned from 400 nm to 600 nm with a 5-nm slit width for excitation and a 10-nm slit width for emission. Spectra were processed by subtracting the background of buffer and/or additives where appropriate and by averaging three sets of scans. To ensure that the fluorescence changes were due to the changes of distance between donor and acceptor and not to the interaction of these fragments with the donor, parallel experiments were performed with donor-alone-labeled CaM. Data were compared with the FRET obtained with a CaM kinase KII peptide (FNARRKLKGAILTTMLATRN, designated FNA-peptide) that is known to bring the two lobes of CaM in close proximity (28Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To calculate the apparent affinity of CT2 and the synthetic peptides for CaM, we titrated D/A CaM in 20 mm MOPS pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2 with increasing CT1-, CT2-, IQ-, A-, or C-peptide. Fluorescence emission data at 490 nm were read on an ISS PC1 Photon Counting Spectrofluorometer (ISS, Champaign, Illinois), with a 1-mm slit for excitation and 2-mm slit for emission, at a 334 nm excitation wavelength. Data were processed by subtracting the background of buffer and/or additives where appropriate. The data were fit with a four parameter-Hill equation in SigmaPlot. Preparation of CT1 or CT2/15N,13C-labeled CaM Complex for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR)—15N,13C-labeled CaM was created by growing cells in M9 minimal medium using an expression plasmid coding for CaM. [15N]NH4Cl and d-[U-13C]glucose were the only nitrogen and carbon sources for the cells. Other steps involved in expression and purification of 15N,13C-labeled CaM were the same as for wild-type CaM. The complex of 15N,13C-labeled CaM/CT1 or CT2 for NMR was obtained by refolding the solubilized CT1 or CT2 in the presence of 15N,13C-labeled CaM. The His tag was cleaved with biotinylated thrombin, and the thrombin was removed from solution with streptavidin agarose (Novagen). The cleaved His tag was removed from the complex solution during dialysis against the final buffer (10 mm imidazole pH 6.4, 2 mm CaCl2) with a 10,000 MWCO cassette (Pierce). NMR Methodology—NMR experiments were collected on a DRX 600 MHz spectrometer instrument using a 5-mm TXI probe or cryoprobe at 47 °C. Complexes of Ca2+-loaded 15N,13C-labeled CaM bound to CT1 or CT2 were prepared as described above and then concentrated to 0.5–1 mm. Peptide-CaM complexes were prepared by adding the appropriate peptide directly to the Ca2+-CaM NMR sample. Final NMR samples contained 10 mm imidazole, and 2 mm CaCl2 in 95% H2O, 5% D2OatpH 6.4. Amide chemical shifts for free Ca2+-CaM in the absence of salt were assigned by comparison to reported chemical shifts for free Ca2+-CaM in 100 mm KCl (29Ikura M. Spera S. Barbato G. Kay L.E. Krinks M. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9216-9228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed by the following triple resonance experiments: CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, and 15N-edited NOESYHSQC. CaM complexes were assigned using the above mentioned experiments and in addition three-dimensional HNCO and HN(CA)CO experiments were also collected. All data were processed using Felix 2002 software from Accelrys. Expression of Fragments of the C-terminal Tail of the CaV1.2 α1 Subunit and Analysis of Their Ability to Bind CaM—To elucidate the determinants of the molecular interactions of CaM with the C-terminal tail of the CaV1.2 α1 subunit, we expressed or synthesized fragments of this region containing all or part of the putative binding motifs (Fig. 1). For these studies we used three synthetic peptides designated A (amino acids 1609–1628), C (amino acids 1627–1652), and IQ (amino acids 1665–1685). We expressed two fragments of the C-terminal tail: CT1 (amino acids 1538–1692, containing the putative EF hand as well as the A, C, and IQ motifs) and CT2 (amino acids 1596–1692, containing the A, C, and IQ motifs but missing the putative EF hand). We analyzed the interactions of these fragments and peptides with CaM using nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. When expressed in Escherichia coli, both CT1 and CT2 were found in inclusion bodies. A small amount of soluble CT1 or CT2 can be obtained by extraction of the inclusion bodies and a subsequent refolding step (see “Experimental Procedures”). The interaction of refolded CT1 with CaM as assessed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis is shown in Fig. 2. CT1 is highly positively charged (isoelectric point 10.5) and does not enter the nondenaturing gel at either high or low Ca2+ concentrations (lane 1 of Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). The interaction of CT1 with CaM was assessed by the appearance of a more slowly migrating complex CT1/CaM or by a decrease in the intensity of CaM band. A stable CT1-CaM complex was formed at high Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 2A). The densitometric analysis of the disappearance of the CaM band at different fragment concentrations is shown in Fig. 2C. A very limited and low affinity interaction of this fragment was detected with apoCaM (assessed by the disappearance of the apoCaM band on the gel, Fig. 2, B and C).Fig. 2Calcium-dependent complex formation of CT1 with CaM in 15% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel. CT1 was incubated with 2 μg of CaM (in 20 μl, final 6 μm) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 50 mm MOPS pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100 with 2 mm Ca2+ (A)or 2mm EGTA (B) before electrophoresis. Lane 1, 2 μg CT1 alone; lanes 2–9, the molar ratio of CT1:CaM is 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, respectively. I/I0 designates the ratio of the intensity of the CaM band in the presence of CT1 versus that of CaM alone (C), and intensities were obtained by densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained CaM bands from three independent nondenaturing gels. The curve with filled squares is for the low Ca2+ condition and the one with filled circles is for the high Ca2+ condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although only a small amount of soluble CT1 or CT2 can be obtained as described above, the presence of CaM during the refolding step greatly enhances the amount of CT1 and CT2 that can be isolated in a soluble form. As shown in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the soluble fraction in Fig. 3, the amount of soluble CT1 is directly proportional to the CaM added (lane 2 of Fig. 3A). Other proteins and excess CT1 are found in the insoluble pellet (lane 3 of Fig. 3A). The CT1-CaM complex remains soluble even when concentrated to 100 mg of protein per ml. The complex of CT1 and CaM showed evidence of 2 complexes in nondenaturing gels (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Using N-terminal sequencing we found that some proteolysis after amino acid 1595 had occurred during the isolation. This observation led us to create CT2. CT2 also required the presence of CaM in the refolding step (lane 4 of Fig. 3A), and the amount of soluble protein obtained was proportional to the amount of CaM added (lane 5 of Fig. 3A). The presence of free CaM in nondenaturing gels of CT1 but not CT2 (lane 2 of Fig. 3B) suggests that the N-terminal half of CT1 either decreases the affinity for CaM or inhibits the refolding of the fragment. To examine the effect of Ca2+ concentration on the facilitated refolding the amount of soluble protein obtained when the refolding was performed in <10 nm, 100 nm, 5 μm, 100 μm, and 2 mm free Ca2+ was examined (Fig. 4). Some facilitated refolding of both CT1 (Fig. 4A) and CT2 (Fig. 4B) could be detected at all Ca2+ concentrations in the presence of CaM (lanes 1–5), but was maximal at concentrations above 100 μm. Without CaM, no facilitated refolding was detected at any Ca2+ concentration for either CT1 and CT2 (lanes 6–10). The molecular equivalents of CaM required to refold CT1 and CT2 suggests that only one CaM is binding to CT1 and CT2. Ca2+Binding to Both Lobes of CaM Is Required for Maximal CaM-assisted Refolding—To evaluate the effects of Ca2+ binding to the N- and C-lobes of CaM on the facilitated refolding we examined the ability of Ca2+ binding site mutants of CaM to promote refolding at high Ca2+ concentrations. For these experiments we used: 1) N-CaM, a CaM composed of amino acids 1–75, missing the C-lobe, 2) C-CaM, a CaM composed of amino acids 76–148, missing the N-lobe, 3) E12Q CaM which cannot bind Ca2+ at the N-lobe, 4) E34Q which cannot bind Ca2+ at the C-lobe, and 5) E1234Q which cannot bind Ca2+ at either the N- or C-lobes. These CaM mutants have been described previously (25Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Rodney G.G. Krol J. Williams B. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12430-12435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although none of the five CaM mutants were as effective as the wild-type CaM for the refolding, N-CaM (lane 4 of Fig. 5, A and B), C-CaM (lane 6 of Fig. 5, A and B), E12Q (lane 8 of Fig. 5, A and B) and E34Q (lane 10 of Fig. 5B) produced some facilitated refolding. In contrast, the E1234Q did not facilitate refolding. This suggests that both lobes of Ca2+-CaM contribute to the facilitated refolding of the CaV1.2 α1 C-terminal tail fragments. FRET Analysis to Determine the Effects of CT1, CT2, and Synthetic Peptides on the Conformation of CaM—To determine the effects of binding to the C-terminal tail of the CaV1.2 α1 subunit on the conformation of CaM, we examined the ability of a double-labeled CaM (1,5-IAEDANS and DDPM) bound to the fragments or the peptides to produce FRET at high and low Ca2+ concentrations. Since the efficiency of FRET depends upon the distance between the donor and the acceptor in CaM, the emission fluorescence of the D/A CaM at 490 nm can be used to compare the relative distances between the two lobes of CaM when bound to the fragments or peptides. At high Ca2+ concentrations, CT2 (Fig. 6A), the IQ-peptide (Fig. 6B), and the A-peptide (Fig. 6C) all decreased the fluorescence of D/A CaM. In contrast, the C-peptide (Fig. 6D) increased the fluorescence of D/A CaM. These findings suggest that the lobes of CaM are closer together when bound to CT2, the IQ-peptide, and the A-peptide compared with the C-peptide. The longer CT1 fragment produces similar FRET changes to those determined with CT2 (not shown). As a control we examined the fluorescence at 490 nm with CaM that was labeled only with the donor compound (D/CaM) and found that the fluorescence did not change upon addition of the peptides or fragments (data not shown). With CT1, CT2, and IQ, saturation of the FRET changes was obtained at 1:1 molar ratios of fragment/CaM (Fig. 6, A and B). A higher molar ratio for saturation of the FRET changes was required for both the A- and C-peptides (Fig. 6, C and D), consistent with our findings that the IQ-peptide has a higher affinity for CaM than either the A- or C-peptide (1Pate P. Mochca-Morales J. Wu Y. Zhang J.Z. Rodney G.G. Serysheva I.I. Williams B.Y. Anderson M.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol.

Analysis of the concentration dependence of the FRET changes (Fig. 6E) was used to calculate apparent affinities for CaM of 37 ± 3 nm for CT2 (n = 3), 45 ± 4nm for IQ (n = 3), and 76 ± 5nm (n = 3) for A-peptide). The titration curve of CT1 is essentially identical to that of CT2 (data not shown). Our measured Kd for CaM binding to CT2 is comparable to the value (Kd = 163 nm) reported by Erickson et al. (30Erickson M.G. Liang H. Mori M.X. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) for CaM binding to full-length α1C. The maximal fluorescence decrease of the D/A CaM in the presence of either the IQ-peptide or A-peptide is similar to that obtained with the control FNA-peptide (Fig. 6, B and C), which is known to bring the two lobes of CaM into close proximity (28Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the fragments CT1 and CT2 produced an intermediate decrease of D/A CaM fluorescence, suggesting that the conformation of CaM bound to the fragment is different than when bound to either A- or IQ-peptides. This could reflect a difference in conformation of these sequences (IQ or A) within the larger fragment or a contribution of the C sequence to the CaM interaction. At low Ca2+ concentrations, the fragments and peptides did not produce FRET of D/A CaM (data not shown), indicating that the either conformational change in CaM or its interaction with the fragments and peptides are Ca2+-dependent. Effect of CT1 and CT2 on Backbone Amide Chemical Shifts of Ca2+-CaM—We used amide chemical shift perturbation mapping to compare the interactions of CaM with the expressed fragments of the C-terminal tail of the CaV1.2 α1 subunit (CT1 and CT2) versus the synthetic peptides (C and IQ) corresponding to the putative CaM bind"

This study concerns identification of residues involved in cation transport via the NCKX Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchanger. In situ studies on the properties of the NCKX cation transport sites have only been carried out on the NCKX1 exchanger in retinal rod outer segments (reviewed in Refs. 4Schnetkamp P.P.M. Prog.

The values obtained in situ for NCKX1 and in heterologous systems for the various NCKX isoforms mentioned above were quite similar. The apparent Km for internal and external Ca2+ were both found to be 1–3 μd, the Km for external K+ was reported to be 2–10 md, whereas the Km for external Na+ was found to be 35–45 md with a Hill coefficient of ∼2. However, in one study a much higher value of >35 md was reported for the external K+Km of rat NCKX2 (14Dong H. Light P.E. French R.J. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25919-25928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Comparing the sequences of the various NCKX proteins used in the above-cited studies suggests that two distinct and highly conserved stretches of NCKX sequence contribute the residues important to cation binding and transport. These so-called α1 and α2 repeats are thought to have arisen from an ancient gene duplication event and are the only domains that show significant sequence similarity between members of the SLC24 NCKX gene family and members of the SLC8 NCX gene family (19Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Scanning mutagenesis of the α1 and α2 repeats in human NCKX2 identified 20 residues, which, when substituted individually, resulted in a strong reduction (>80%) of the maximal transport rate of the mutant NCKX2 protein; this includes eight residues conserved between members of both NCKX and NCX gene families (20Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K.-J. Perizzolo M. Eisner L. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The position of these eight residues is illustrated in Fig. 1B. Individual substitution of the eight corresponding residues in NCX1 greatly lowered the maximal transport rate of the mutant NCX1 proteins precluding detailed kinetic measurements (21Nicoll D.A.

The objective of this study was to identify residues within the two α repeats of NCKX2 that control the K+ and Ca2+ concentration dependences of the NCKX2 protein. We developed a sensitive fluorometric assay for NCKX function in mammalian cell lines permitting measurements of cation dependence of NCKX2 mutant proteins with greatly reduced maximal transport rates. Our results show that substitution of several of the residues highlighted in Fig. 1B resulted in parallel changes in K+ and Ca2+ concentration dependences of the mutant NCKX2 proteins expressed in HEK293 cells. Mutagenesis and Protein Analysis—Codons for selected residues were mutated in the Myc-tagged short splice variant of human NCKX2 cDNA (AAF25811), and NCKX function of the mutant NCKX2 proteins was analyzed after heterologous expression with the pEIA vector in an insect cell line (High Five cells) as described before (20Winkfein R.J.

Wild-type and mutant NCKX2 proteins expressed in cell lines were detected by Western blotting with the mononclonal Myc antibody (NEB Biolabs, Pickering, Ontario) after separation on SDS-PAGE as described before (20Winkfein R.J.

The final cell pellet was resuspended in 150 mm choline chloride, 80 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 0.05 mm EDTA, and was stored at 25 °C. 45Ca (0.5–1.0 μCi per experiment) (Amersham Biosciences) uptake experiments were carried out in a medium containing 150 mm KCl, 80 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes (adjusted to pH 7.4 with arginine), 1 μm carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), and 0.036 mm CaCl2 in addition to 45Ca. Nonspecific 45Ca uptake was measured when the uptake medium contained NaCl instead of KCl, which results in complete inhibition of 45Ca uptake via reverse Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchange. External 45Ca was removed from 45Ca taken up into cells by a rapid filtration and washing procedure with the use of borosilicate glass fiber filters; the ice-cold washing medium contained 140 mm KCl, 80 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA. NaCl, KCl, LiCl, and choline chloride were all SigmaUltra grade (Sigma-Aldrich). Further details of the 45Ca uptake method have been described before (9Szerencsei R.T. Tucker J.E. Cooper C.B.

Protein content of cell samples was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Functional Analysis with Fluo-3—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were subcultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transient expression of wild-type and mutant human NCKX2 cDNAs was carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Briefly, 1 ml of transfection solution with calcium phosphate-cDNA precipitates was prepared by adding 0.5 ml of DNA solution (10–30 μg of plasmid DNA in 500 mm CaCl2 solution) to 0.5 ml of phosphate-containing solution (274 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm Na2HPO4, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.07); the mixture was applied to 10-cm plates containing 50% confluent HEK293 cells for 16–20 h. Next, the medium containing the transfection solution was replaced with fresh DMEM. Two days after transfection, the cells were washed on the plate and collected in suspension. The cell suspension (in 0.5 ml of DMEM) was loaded with 12 μm Fluo-3AM for 20 min. Nonhydrolyzed Fluo-3AM was removed by washing the cells twice with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 6 mdd-glucose, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, and 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4. Sulfinpyrazone is an anion transporter inhibitor that may reduce leakage of Fluo-3 from the cells. Even in the presence of sulfinpyrazone, dye leakage limited the amount of time available to sequential measurements of a series of four experimental conditions (e.g. testing four different KCl concentrations) on different aliquots of the same HEK293 cell suspension. In the second wash step, KCl was omitted from the above solution. About 100,000 Fluo-loaded cells (50 μl) were added to a cuvette containing 1.95 ml of 150 mm LiCl, 6 mdd-glucose, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, and placed in the thermostatted cuvette housing of a series 2 SLM Luminometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, Ill). Fluorescence was measured under continuous stirring and upon addition of various amounts of CaCl2 and KCl to initiate NCKX transport as described in the text. CaCl2 and KCl were added from concentrated stock solutions (0.5 m and 4 m, respectively). Ca2+ dependence was measured by varying the extracellular free [Ca2+] in the range of 1, 10, 100, and 500 μm. The lower two free [Ca2+] were obtained with the use of mixtures of HEDTA and Ca-HEDTA (Kd = 1.5 μm at pH 7.4) to buffer [Ca2+]: 1 mm HEDTA and 1 mm CaHEDTA to obtain [Ca2+]free of 1.2 μm, 1 mm HEDTA and 8 mm CaHEDTA to obtain [Ca2+]free of 10.8 μm. (note that the solution contained 0.1 mm EDTA as well). HEDTA and CaHEDTA were added from 200 mm stock solutions adjusted to pH 7.4 with arginine. The higher two free [Ca2+] of 100 and 500 μm were obtained by addition of CaCl2 to final concentrations of 200 and 600 μm, respectively (at the pH of 7.4 used 100 μm of the added Ca2+ is chelated to the 100 μm EDTA present in the solution). To saturate Fluo-3 and obtain the maximal fluorescence, HEK293 cells were permeabilized by the addition of 0.02% saponin in the presence of saturating [Ca2+] (1–5 mm); to obtain the signal for Ca2+-free Fluo-3, HEK293 cells were permeabilized by the addition of 0.02% saponin in the presence 100 μm EDTA. Further details of the Fluo-3 assay as applied to cell suspensions have been published before (23Cooper C.B. Szerencsei R.T. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 847-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study we carried out scanning mutagenesis of the two α repeats of NCKX2 and identified several residues that are important for NCKX transport function and are thought to be located well within the plane of the lipid bilayer: these include four acidic residues, four hydroxyl containing residues, and two proline residues (20Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K.-J. Perizzolo M. Eisner L. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The results obtained previously for nine of these ten residues (20Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K.-J. Perizzolo M. Eisner L. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) are summarized in Fig. 1A. For each residue substitution a set of 2–5 new experiments was added. In addition to the mutant NCKX2 proteins reported before, four new substitutions were analyzed that represent conservative Ser to Thr and Thr to Ser changes. Fig. 1B illustrates the location of these residues within our current model of the NCKX2 topology; the eight residues located in hydrophobic segments H2 and H8 (part of the α1 and α2 repeat, respectively) are conserved between the NCKX and NCX gene families, whereas members of the NCX gene family do not have acidic residues in positions equivalent to the NCKX2 residues Asp258 and Asp575. The four new mutant NCKX2 proteins represent conservative substitutions of the four critical hydroxyl-containing residues found in all NCX and NCKX proteins. Interestingly, in all three cases (Ser185, Ser545, Ser552) the conservative Ser to Thr substitution resulted in a very strong reduction of mutant NCKX2 transport function compared with wild-type NCKX2, whereas the conservative T544S substitution had much less effect on NCKX2 transport compared with the less conservative T544A and T544C substitutions. When mutant NCKX2 protein samples were analyzed by Western blotting, most showed the 2-band pattern observed for wild-type NCKX2, in which the lower band represents NCKX2 protein from which the signal peptide was cleaved. The S545T mutant NCKX2 protein consistently showed mostly the upper band representing the uncleaved NCKX2 (Fig. 2). This is a highly uncommon phenotype among the ∼150 single residue NCKX2 mutants we have analyzed in the High Five cell system (also observed for the S185C and S185T mutant NCKX2 proteins in some, but not all experiments). As signal peptide cleavage appears essential for plasma membrane targeting (24Kang K.-J. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9438-9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), strongly reduced transport observed for the S545T NCKX2 mutant proteins may be caused by the lack of cleaved mutant NCKX2 protein present in the plasma membrane. Surface biotinylation of the S545T mutant NCKX2 protein (e.g. Ref. 24Kang K.-J. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9438-9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) confirmed that only the small amount of mutant NCKX2 protein represented by the lower band was present in the plasma membrane (data not shown). 45Ca uptake via reverse Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchange was used as a simple quantitative assay for NCKX2 function as illustrated in Fig. 3. Analysis of shifts in K+ and Ca2+ concentration dependences of NCKX2 mutants requires a sensitive and consistent assay for NCKX function in view of our observation that maximal NCKX transport activity was strongly reduced upon substitution of residues hypothesized to be involved in cation binding. Only two of the mutant NCKX2 proteins illustrated in Fig. 1 showed sufficient NCKX2 transport activity to allow consistent measurements of the K+ concentration dependence of 45Ca uptake via reverse Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchange (Fig. 3). Lowering extracellular K+ concentration affected the initial rate and the total amount of 45Ca uptake in comparable fashion, similar as observed before for a variety of different NCKX clones as well as for NCX1 (9Szerencsei R.T.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1424-1434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Much higher K+ concentrations were required to activate 45Ca uptake via reverse Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchange in the case of the D548E mutant (apparent Km ∼ 10 md), whereas the K+ dependence of the P187A mutant (apparent Km ∼ 0.8 md) appeared unchanged when compared with wild-type NCKX2 (apparent Km ∼0.7 md) (apparent Km values were estimated from an analysis of the initial rates of 45Ca uptake). The ability to resolve low NCKX2 activity in these experiments is limited by the nonspecific 45Ca uptake observed in high NaCl medium when NCKX2-mediated uptake is completely inhibited. (Note: uptake in NaCl medium was very similar to that observed in cells transfected with empty vector.) In cells expressing wild-type NCKX2, the ratio of specific NCKX2-mediated uptake/nonspecific uptake (i.e. that observed in NaCl medium) was about 10 in this particular experiment, but this ratio had dropped to 2 or less in the case of most of the NCKX2 mutants listed in Fig. 1. Here we describe a more sensitive assay for NCKX function that measures NCKX2-mediated changes in intracellular free Ca2+ in HEK293 cells transfected with (mutant) NCKX2 cDNAs and loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+-indicating dye Fluo-3. High Five cells proved to be not suited for this method caused by the fast leakage of Fluo-3 from these cells. The Fluo-3 assay, illustrated in Fig. 4, enabled us to analyze cation dependence for most of the NCKX2 mutant proteins even when maximal transport capacity was severely reduced. HEK293 cells were loaded with Fluo-3 after transfection with either empty vector or vector containing wild-type or mutant human NCKX2 cDNA. About 100,000 of the Fluo-loaded cells were placed in a cuvette containing 2 ml of a buffered LiCl solution with a final concentration of 100 μd EDTA present. Fluo-3 fluorescence was continuously measured while various additions were made to the cuvette from concentrated solutions under constant stirring (Fig. 4A). First, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 250 μd as indicated by the arrow and by the spike in the trace; the spike was caused by lowering the pipette through the light beam and served as a convenient event marker. The CaCl2 addition caused a small and instantaneous increase in fluorescence caused by saturation of the small amount of Fluo-3 dye that had leaked out of the cells. No time-dependent increase in Fluo-3 fluorescence was observed indicating the lack of any Ca2+ influx in either control or NCKX2-transfected cells under this condition. The second arrow indicates the addition of KCl to a final concentration of 20 md. This KCl addition caused no change in Fluo-3 fluorescence in control cells, but led to a rapid and large rise in Fluo-3 fluorescence in NCKX2-transfected cells. The fast rise in fluorescence indicates a rapid K+-dependent Ca2+ influx representing reverse Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchange. The third arrow indicates addition of saponin (final concentration 0.02%) to permeabilize the plasma membrane. Saponin addition caused the release of all Fluo-3 present in the cells, thereby saturating Fluo-3 fluorescence by the high (∼150 μd) Ca2+ concentration in the medium. Minimum Fluo-3 fluorescence (obtained by addition of saponin in the presence 0.1 md EDTA) was only slightly lower than fluorescence representing resting Ca2+ levels observed in HEK293 cells in the LiCl-EDTA medium at the start of the experiment (i.e. before activating Ca2+ influx via the exchanger). The K+- and Ca2+-dependent increase in Fluo-3 fluorescence observed in cells transfected with wild-type NCKX2 ranged from 30 - 50% of the saponin-induced increase in Fluo-3 fluorescence in different transfection experiments. When NCKX2 cDNA was co-transfected with cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) a similar percentage of the transfected cells showed GFP staining indicating the percentage of successfully transfected cells (data not shown). Combined these results suggest that reverse Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchange via wild-type NCKX2 leads to a rapid Ca2+ influx that competes effectively with Ca2+ clearance mechanisms endogenous to HEK cells and results in a significantly elevated free Ca2+ concentration and increased Fluo-3 fluorescence, but only in those cells transfected with NCKX2. Since the fluorescence measurements represent a mixed population of transfected and untransfected cells, we have not attempted to convert fluorescence into free cytosolic [Ca2+] for those cells successfully transfected with NCKX2. Using the above Fluo-3 assay, we measured the K+-induced rise in Fluo-3 fluorescence as a function of the external K+ concentration (top panels of Fig. 4B). Similar to the pattern observed in the 45Ca uptake assay, lowering the external K+ concentration below saturating values lowered the initial rate as well as the amplitude of the changes in Fluo-3 fluorescence observed in cells transfected with wild-type NCKX2. The smaller amplitudes of the Fluo-3 signals indicate a lower free [Ca2+] in the HEK293 cells caused by a reduced rate of Ca2+ influx via NCKX2, while Ca2+ clearance via the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps remained constant. Thus, the plateau fluorescence reflects the equilibrium free Ca2+ concentration that arises from the balance of Ca2+ influx via NCKX2 and Ca2+ efflux via the Ca2+ pump. The K+ dependence of the plateau fluorescence levels was very similar to the K+ dependence of the initial rate of the changes in Fluo-3 fluorescence. The observed pattern suggests that both the initial rate and amplitude of the Fluo-3 signal can be used as a semiquantitative indicator of NCKX2 transport function. To ensure that changes in cation dependence were not caused by lower maximal transport activities per se, we compared wild-type NCKX2 with the E651D NCKX2 mutant, previously reported to have about 13% of wild-type activity in the High Five cell system (20Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K.-J. Perizzolo M. Eisner L. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Glu651 is located at the C terminus of NCKX2 (Fig. 1B) and is unlikely to be directly involved in cation transport. Consistent with the results obtained with the High Five cell system (20Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K.-J. Perizzolo M. Eisner L. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the maximal amplitude of the Fluo-3 signal observed for the E651D NCKX2 mutant was much smaller than that observed for wild-type NCKX2, indicative of a much reduced maximal transport rate compared with wild-type NCKX2. However, the K+ concentration dependence of the Fluo-3 signals observed in cells expressing the E651D mutant NCKX2 protein appeared very similar to that observed for wild-type NCKX2 (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that reduced maximal transport rate did not itself result in a change in K+ concentration dependence. The patterns illustrated in Fig. 4B were highly reproducible, and for a number of experiments the initial rate of the K+-induced fluorescence changes (change observed after 5 s) and the amplitude of the change in fluorescence change (fluorescence 40 s after addition of KCl) were averaged and normalized with respect to those observed for the highest K+ concentration of 50 md used. Both analyses yielded very similar K+ concentration dependence for wild-type NCKX2 and the E651D NCKX2 mutant with a half-maximal rate or amplitude observed at ∼1 md (bottom panels of Fig. 4B). This value is very similar to that observed in Fig. 3 using the 45Ca uptake method. In the same set of experiments, the Ca2+ concentration dependence was measured for wild-type NCKX2 and the E651D NCKX2 mutant at a fixed KCl concentration of 20 md; the results were analyzed in the same way as shown for the K+ dependence (Fig. 4C). As observed for the K+ dependence, very similar Ca2+ dependence was observed for wild-type NCKX2 and the E651D NCKX2 mutant, both when analyzing the initial rate or the amplitude of the fluorescence signals. Half-maximal rate or amplitude was observed at ∼1 μd free [Ca2+]. Fluo-3 fluorescence does not represent a linear [Ca2+] scale, and some compression should occur at higher fluorescence levels because of saturation of the dye. This could result in an underestimate of apparent Km values. The compression effect should be more obvious for the maximal amplitude of the fluorescence signals and for NCKX2 (mutant) proteins that show high transport rates (e.g. wild-type NCKX2). Two observations presented here suggest that compression is not a major problem. 1) The concentration dependence obtained from the initial rates and from the amplitudes of the fluorescence signals, respectively, was very similar. 2) The K+ and Ca2+ dependences were very similar for the two different NCKX2 proteins illustrated in"
https://openalex.org/W2050429937,"Apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV, a component of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins secreted by the small intestine, has been shown to play an important role in the control of lipid homeostasis. Numerous studies have described the induction of apoA-IV gene expression by lipids, but the molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated that a lipid bolus induced transcription of the apoA-IV gene in transgenic mice and that the regulatory region of the apoA-IV gene, composed of the apoC-III enhancer and the apoA-IV promoter (eC3-A4), was responsible for this induction. In enterocyte Caco-2/TC7 cells, a permanent supply of lipids at the basal pole induced expression of the apoA-IV gene both at the transcriptional level and through mRNA stabilization. ApoA-IV gene transcription and protein secretion were further induced by an apical supply of complex lipid micelles mimicking the composition of duodenal micelles, and this effect was not reproduced by apical delivery of different combinations of micelle components. Only induction of the apoA-IV gene by lipid micelles involved the participation of hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-4, as demonstrated using a dominant negative form of this transcription factor. Accordingly, lipid micelles increased the DNA binding activity of HNF-4 on the eC3-A4 region. These results emphasize the importance of physiological delivery of dietary lipids on apoA-IV gene expression and the implication of HNF-4 in this regulation.

A-IV is an abundant apolipoprotein that is synthesized and secreted by the small intestine in humans and by both the liver and small intestine in rodents. The small intestine is the major organ responsible for circulating apoA-IV, the plasma concentration of which essentially depends on the nutritional status (see Ref. 1Stan S. Delvin E. Lambert M. Seidman E. Levy E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar for review). Apolipoprotein A-IV appears to have myriad functions. This protein has been shown to modulate plasma lipoprotein metabolism, suggesting a major role for apoA-IV in the prevention of atherosclerosis. ApoA-IV may also have an impact on gastrointestinal functions such as gastric motility. Furthermore, a series of studies showed that apoA-IV, secreted by the intestine or specifically expressed in the hypothalamus, may act as a signal for satiation (see Refs. 1Stan S. Delvin E. Lambert M. Seidman E. Levy E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and 2Liu M. Doi T. Tso P. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar for reviews). Numerous studies have reported that the intestinal synthesis and secretion of apoA-IV were increased following lipid supply, but the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of apoA-IV gene expression remain unknown (see Ref. 1Stan S. Delvin E. Lambert M. Seidman E. Levy E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar for review). Hayashi et al. (3Hayashi H. Nutting D.F. Fujimoto K. Cardelli J.A. Black D. Tso P. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1613-1625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that stimulation of apoA-IV synthesis and secretion were associated with chylomicron assembly after lipid supply. Another study showed that induction of apoA-IV gene transcription by lipids in newborn swine small intestine involves the DNA binding of a repressor protein on the swine apoA-IV promoter (4Lu S. Yao Y. Wang H. Meng S. Cheng X. Black D.D. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2003; 284: G248-G254Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, because the induction of apoA-IV gene expression was not markedly observed near weaning in the swine intestine (5Black D.D. Rohwer-Nutter P.L. Davidson N.O. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Black et al. suggested that this regulatory mechanism was specific to the newborn swine. The apoA-IV gene is comprised within a cluster with apoA-I and apoC-III genes. We have demonstrated previously that apoA-IV gene is expressed in the intestine according to cephalocaudal and crypt-to-villus axes and that the apoA-IV promoter, when fused with apoC-III enhancer (6Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.Y. Janvier P.L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.P. Kalopissis A.D. Zannis V. Chambaz J. Pincon-Raymond M. Cardot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4954-4961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was necessary and sufficient to restrict apoA-IV expression to villus enterocytes. We have also shown that this specific pattern of apoA-IV expression requires the presence of a functional hormone-responsive element, located within the distal promoter of the apoA-IV gene (7Sauvaget D. Chauffeton V. Citadelle D. Chatelet F.P. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chambaz J. Pincon-Raymond M. Cardot P. Le Beyec J. Ribeiro A. J. Biol.

Mutations or deletions of DNA-binding sites for hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-4 located on the apoC-III enhancer or on the apoA-IV promoter markedly decreased the expression of apoA-IV (7Sauvaget D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4689-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting a major role for HNF-4 in the control of apoA-IV expression in the small intestine. Other transcription factors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, retinoid X receptor, or sterol regulatory element-binding protein, have also been involved in the control of lipid metabolism, and several studies indicate that such factors are affected by dietary lipids (see Ref. 9Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar for review). However, the liver-specific invalidation of the HNF-4α gene in mice (10Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated that HNF-4 is an important factor in the control of expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Accordingly, in humans, mutations in the HNF-4α gene cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY-1), which displays hypolipidemia resulting from a reduced expression of HNF-4α-responsive genes, e.g. apolipoproteins and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (11Shih D.Q.

(14Petrescu A.D. Payne H.R. Boedecker A. Chao H. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51813-51824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reported a physical and functional interaction of HNF-4 with acyl-CoA-binding protein that exhibits a high and specific affinity for long chain fatty acyl-CoAs. The purpose of our study was to analyze the molecular mechanisms involved in lipid-dependent regulation of the apoA-IV gene in intestinal cells and the potential role of HNF-4 in this regulation. We have considered the effects of a physiological supply of lipids to intestinal cells, i.e. a permanent supply of plasma lipids at the basal pole of the enterocytes and an acute apical delivery of lipid micelles, which occurs after a fat-rich meal. Indeed, in vivo, dietary lipids reach the duodenum as complex micelles resulting from their solubilization by bile components (biliary acids, cholesterol, and phospholipids) and their concomitant digestion by pancreatic hydrolases into fatty acids, 2-monoacylglycerol, and lysophospholipids. We have reported recently that such lipid micelles were efficient inducers of the secretion of apoB-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (15Chateau D. Pauquai T. Delers F. Rousset M. Chambaz J. Demignot S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 202: 767-776Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and specifically control apoB traffic in the enterocytic Caco-2 cell line (16Morel E. Demignot S. Chateau D. Chambaz J. Rousset M. Delers F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that the supply of lipids at the basal pole of the enterocytes induces expression of the apoA-IV gene both at the transcriptional level and through mRNA stabilization, whereas an apical supply of lipid micelles further induces apoA-IV transcription through an HNF-4-dependent mechanism.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium/Glutamax-1 (25 mm glucose) supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) and 20% heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) fetal bovine serum (Abcys, Annecy, France). The medium was changed 48 h after seeding and changed daily thereafter (17Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot-Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J.

In some experiments, Caco-2/TC7 cells were seeded in the presence of serum, but 48 h after seeding and thereafter, the serum was replaced by 1× ITS (10 μg/ml insulin, 0.55 μg/ml transferrin, and 6.7 ng/ml selenium; Invitrogen). After confluence, only the medium of the basal compartment contained 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum or ITS medium. In all experiments, cells were grown until 14–15 days after seeding.

The composition of lipid micelles was similar to that of the duodenal micelles resulting from lipid digestion (19Hernell O. Staggers J.E. Carey M.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2041-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), i.e. 0.6 mm oleic acid, 0.2 mm l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine, 0.05 mm cholesterol, 0.2 mm 2-monooleoylglycerol, and 2 mm taurocholic acid. Lipid micelles were added to the medium of the upper compartment for the last 24 h of culture. For the preparation of lipids combined with FAF-BSA (Sigma), serum-free medium containing 1% sterile FAF-BSA was added to dried lipids, and the mixture was shaken gently for 1 h at 37 °C.The resulting molar ratio of oleic acid to albumin was 4:1. Albumin-bound lipids were added to the upper compartment for the last 24 h of culture. Lipid concentrations were the same in studies using lipids combined with BSA or taurocholic acid as in studies using complex micelles. In some experiments, ITS medium of the lower compartment was supplemented with lipids (0.4 mm oleic acid, 0.2 mm palmitic acid, and 0.04 mm cholesterol) combined with 1% (w/v) FAF-BSA, with a 4:1 molar ratio of fatty acids to albumin (ITS/L medium). To maintain a 4:1 molar ratio when lipids were added separately, the ITS medium supplemented with palmitic acid, oleic acid, or cholesterol contained 0.33%, 0.66%, and 0.1% of FAF-BSA, respectively. An appropriate stock solution of lipids in chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v) was stored at –20 °C. Lipids were dissolved with an aliquot of the appropriate FAF-BSA solution in serum-free medium using an ultrasound bath. The final concentration of lipids was obtained by addition of the rest of the FAF-BSA solution. The Caco-2/TC7 cells were cultured in the presence of ITS medium supplemented with lipids from confluence until the last day of culture. For analysis of lipid uptake, [1-14C]oleic acid (51 μCi/mmol; 2 μCi/ml final medium) was added to lipids. Results are expressed as nmol/mg protein. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Plasmids, Transfection Experiments, and Luciferase Assay—The peC3-A4-LUC plasmid was generated by subcloning the eC3-A4 fragment containing the –520/–890 human apoC-III enhancer fused with the –700/+10 apoA-IV promoter region, obtained from the eC3-A4-CAT plasmid (6Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.Y. Janvier P.L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.P. Kalopissis A.D. Zannis V. Chambaz J. Pincon-Raymond M. Cardot P. J. Biol.

Caco-2/TC7 cells were stably co-transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with peC3-A4-LUC and pPUR vector (Clontech), which contains the puromycin resistance gene. Stable transfectants were selected by puromycin (10 μg/ml; Sigma). The total puromycin-resistant resulting Caco-2/TC7 eC3-A4-LUC cell population was analyzed. After selection, all experiments were performed on filters, using the appropriate culture medium without puromycin. The recombinant adenovirus Ad-DN-HNF-4, which expressed a deletion mutant of HNF-4α lacking residues 361–465, was constructed by digestion of pCDNA1-HNF-4-CD1b (kindly provided by Margarita Hadzopoulou-Cladaras; Ref. 20Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M.

The HNF-4-CD1b fragment obtained was then subcloned by blunt ligation into pTg-6600 vector (kindly provided by Luis Garcia from the Gene Vector Production Network of Généthon, Evry, France) using the EcoRI restriction site. The recombinant adenovirus was then generated by homologous recombination with the pKp1.3 vector (kindly provided by Luis Garcia). The production of infectious particles was performed at Gene Vector Production Network. The recombinant adenovirus Ad-GFP, which expressed green fluorescent protein under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was produced and provided by Gene Vector Production Network. For adenovirus infection experiments, Caco-2/TC7 eC3-A4-LUC cells were seeded at 6 × 104 cells/cm2 on 6-well semipermeable filters and cultured in the appropriate culture medium. After 10 days of culture, post-confluent cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus Ad-DN-HNF-4 or Ad-GFP at a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaque-forming units/cell. Lipid micelles were added 3 days after infection, and the cells were harvested 24 h later. Luciferase activities were assayed as described previously (21Rodolosse A. Carriere V. Rousset M. Lacasa M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Caco-2/TC7 nuclear extracts were prepared as reported previously (22Feuillard J. Gouy H. Bismuth G. Lee L.M. Debre P. Korner M. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with the presence in all buffers of protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (23Lacorte J.M. Fourniat E. Pastier D. Chambaz J. Ribeiro A. Cardot P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were as follows: 5′-GGGAGATGTGGACTTTGCCCCCCATGAGCCC-3′ for AIVE, 5′-TCGATAGTCTCAGGGTCACAAAAGTCCAAGAGGCC-3′ for AIVC, and 5′-CTCCCTATTTTGCCCTCTGGACCCACTGA-3′ for CIII-I. Supershift experiments were performed with antibody directed against HNF-4α (C-19X), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tebu-bio, Le Perray en Yvelines, France). Animals and Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Assay— Transgenic eC3-A4-CAT mice (6Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.Y. Janvier P.L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.P. Kalopissis A.D. Zannis V.

Groups of three animals were given one or two (24 h after the first administration) oral doses of olive oil (400 μl/mouse) by gavage. The control group received an equivalent volume of water by the same route. Animals were sacrificed 4 h after their last gavage. The proximal part of the jejunum was excised quickly for measurement of CAT activity (as described previously; Ref. 6Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.Y. Janvier P.L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.P.

Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using RNAplus reagent (qBiogene, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reverse transcription experiments were performed as described previously (18Carrie ̀re V. Rodolosse A. Lacasa M. Cambier D. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1998; 274: G1101-G1108Crossref Google Scholar) with 2 μg of total RNA in a total volume of 40 μl. Messenger RNA was quantified using the Light-Cycler System according to the manufacturer's procedures (Roche Applied Science). PCRs were performed with a 1:1000 final dilution of the reverse transcription product. The apoA-IV mRNA level was quantified using hybridization probes designed by Genset (Proligo, Paris, France). PCR conditions were one step of denaturation (8 min at 95 °C) followed by 40 cycles (each cycle consisted of 15 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 58 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C). The mRNA levels of the other genes were quantified using SYBR Green, and the PCR conditions were one step of denaturation (8 min at 95 °C) followed by 40 cycles (each cycle consisted of 10 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 58–60 °C, and 10 s at 72 °C). The sequences of the primers used in this study were as follows: (a) for ApoA-IV, 5′-AGCCAGGACAAGACTCTCTC-3′ (forward primer), 5′-TCTCACCTCCCACTGGAC-3′ (reverse primer), 5′-CCCCTTTGGAGAGCTGAGCTG-fitc-3′ (anchor probe), and 5′-LCred640-CCCTGGTGCACTGGCCCC-P-3′ (detection probe); (b) for ApoB, 5′-CCCACAGCAAGCTAATG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GTCTGCAGTTGAGATAG-3′ (reverse primer); (c) for acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase 2, 5′-CGTCTGCAGAGGACAGAAG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GTGTCGGGTCCATTGTACC-3′ (reverse primer); and (d) for MTP, 5′-TTCAGCACCTCAGGACTGC-3′ forward primer and 5′-GTCTGAGGTCTGAGCAGAG-3′ reverse primer. The quantification of 18S RNA (using TaqMan probes from Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) was used as control for the RNA extraction and reverse transcription experiments. Results were expressed as the ratio between the levels of mRNA of interest and 18S RNA. mRNA Stability Studies—Caco-2/TC7 cells were cultured on semipermeable filters in the presence of ITS or ITS/L medium. On the last day of culture, 0.2 mm 5,6-dichloro-1-β-dribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB; Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium in the presence or absence of an apical supply of lipid micelles and maintained throughout experiment. Cells were harvested at the indicated time of culture after the addition of DRB. Total RNA was extracted, and the mRNA level of ApoA-IV was determined. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were cultured in ITS condition with or without lipid micelles in the apical compartment during the last 24 h of culture. The basal media were collected, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture, and concentrated 6-fold using Centricon YM-10 (Millipore, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines, France). An equal volume of each concentrated culture medium was separated by 9% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated in 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-40000) in PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20). They were then probed with a rabbit antibody against rat apoA-IV (1:2000; kindly provided by Dr. A. Mazur, INRA, Theix, France) or with a rabbit antibody against human α-fetoprotein (1:1500; Behring, Marburg, Germany) in 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, followed by a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS-T. Blots were developed with ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. ApoA-IV Gene Transcription Is Induced in Vivo by Dietary Lipids—The effect of lipids on transcription of the apoA-IV gene in intestinal cells was first analyzed in vivo using transgenic mice expressing the CAT reporter gene under the control of the regulatory sequence eC3-A4. This sequence contains the human –700/+10 apoA-IV promoter fused to the human –500/–890 apoC-III enhancer. It is responsible for the specific pattern of expression of the apoA-IV gene along the cephalo-caudal and crypt-to-villus axes of the intestine (6Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.Y. Janvier P.L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.P. Kalopissis A.D. Zannis V. Chambaz J. Pincon-Raymond M. Cardot P. J. Biol.

Transgenic mice were given one or two bolus of olive oil, and CAT activity and endogenous apoA-IV mRNA were analyzed in jejunum samples. The administration of olive oil increased CAT activity up to 3-fold after the second bolus (Fig. 1A), indicating that dietary lipids induce human apoA-IV gene transcription in vivo through the eC3-A4 regulatory region. The physiological relevance of this result was demonstrated by the observation, in the same animals, of a parallel lipid-dependent induction of the endogenous mouse apoA-IV mRNA level (Fig. 1B). ApoA-IV mRNA Expression Requires the Presence of a Permanent Supply of Lipids at the Basal Pole of Caco-2/TC7 Cells—In vivo studies cannot determine whether transcriptional induction of apoA-IV expression was due to a direct effect of the apical supply of dietary lipids on enterocytes or whether it resulted from an increase in plasma lipids. We thus further characterized the lipid-dependent expression of human apoA-IV in Caco-2/TC7 cells, which display morphological and functional characteristics of enterocyte differentiation after confluence (17Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot-Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The culture of Caco-2/TC7 cells on semi-permeable filters allows mimicking of the asymmetry of physiological conditions of lipid supply in intestinal cells, with plasma and luminal lipids supplied at the basal and apical poles of the cells, respectively (16Morel E. Demignot S. Chateau D. Chambaz J. Rousset M. Delers F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the respective influence of an apical supply and a basal supply of lipids on expression of the apoA-IV gene in Caco-2/TC7 cells, we first modulated the presence of lipids in the basal compartment (Fig. 2). We compared cells incubated under standard conditions (i.e. in the presence of serum) with cells incubated with a serum-free, lipid-free ITS defined medium, which allows Caco-2/TC7 cells to grow and differentiate as well as under standard culture conditions (16Morel E. Demignot S. Chateau D. Chambaz J. Rousset M. Delers F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Jumarie C. Malo C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the presence of ITS medium, the level of apoA-IV mRNA was dramatically lower (10-fold) than it was in the presence of serum (Fig. 2). Because serum provides both lipids and growth factors, we further analyzed the effect of a permanent supply of lipids (oleic acid, palmitic acid, and cholesterol) in ITS medium in the basal compartment (ITS/L). Such a condition was previously shown to restore the physiological effect of serum on apoB traffic in Caco-2 cells (16Morel E. Demignot S. Chateau D. Chambaz J. Rousset M. Delers F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the presence of ITS/L, the expression of apoA-IV rose up to the level observed in the presence of serum (Fig. 2), indicating that the expression of apoA-IV mRNA requires a lipid supply at the basal pole of enterocytes. In order to characterize which lipids played a role in apoA-IV expression, we cultured cells with either oleic acid, palmitic acid, or cholesterol complexed to BSA in the basal compartment. As reported in Fig. 2, the effect on apoA-IV expression of lipid supplementation in ITS medium was mainly due to the presence of oleic acid (Fig. 2, compare ITS/L condition with ITS-OA-BSA) and, to a lesser extent, the presence of palmitic acid (Fig. 2, compare ITS/L condition with ITS-PA-BSA). The presence of cholesterol combined with BSA in the basal compartment had no significant effect on apoA-IV expression. Under the same culture conditions, we have also analyzed the expression of apoB and MTP, both of which are involved in the assembly and secretion of chylomicrons, and acyl-CoA: cholesterol O-acyltransferase 2. The different culture conditions analyzed had no effect on the mRNA levels of apoB and acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase 2, but we observed that the mRNA level of MTP was markedly reduced (10-fold) in ITS medium as compared with the serum condition. Moreover, MTP expression was only partially restored after lipid supplementation in ITS medium, indicating that it also requires serum factors. Taken together, these results showed the specificity of the regulation of apoA-IV gene expression by a permanent supply of lipids in the basal compartment. ApoA-IV Gene Expression and Protein Secretion Were Induced by an Apical Supply of Lipid Micelles—Physiologically, after a meal, enterocytes face complex micelles made of fatty acids, 2-monoacylglycerol, lysophospholipids, cholesterol, and biliary acids, resulting from the solubilization of dietary lipids by bile and their digestion by pancreatic hydrolases. We therefore compared the effect of an apical delivery of complex micelles to Caco-2/TC7 cells with that of oleic acid combined with BSA (OA-BSA), which repr"

We have previously demonstrated that cyclin D1 is constitutively expressed in human BON neuroendocrine tumour cells due to an autocrine insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) loop. Here we examine the regulation of cyclin D1 expression by endogenously released IGF-I in BON cells. Cyclin D1 expression in these cells was found to be dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), but independent of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade. Ras- and Rac-GTPases were found to be upstream activators of cyclin D1 expression, whereas protein kinase B/AKT and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) could be established as downstream mediators of cyclin D1 transcription in response to endogenously released IGF-I in these cells. In addition, the Ras/PI3-K/AKT/Rac/NFκB/cyclin D1 signaling cascade triggered by endogenously released IGF-I is sufficient to sustain Rb phosphorylation and cdk4 kinase activity in BON cells. In conclusion, our data provide the first comprehensive map of the signaling events elicited by endogenously released IGF-I leading to constitutive cyclin D1 expression in human neuroendocrine tumour cells."

https://openalex.org/W2114918822,"Retroviral insertions that activate proto-oncogenes are a primary cause of tumors in certain strains of mice. The AKXD recombinant inbred mice are predisposed to a variety of leukemias and lymphomas as a result of viral integration. One common insertion site, the ecotropic viral insertion site 3 (Evi3), has been implicated in most B-cell tumors in the AKXD-27 strain. The Evi3 gene encodes a zinc-finger protein with sequence similarity to the Early B-cell Factor-Associated Zinc-finger gene (EBFAZ). We show that the Evi3 gene is overexpressed in several tumors with viral insertions at Evi3, which results in the upregulation of Early B-cell Factor (EBF)-target gene expression, suggesting that Evi3 modulates EBF activity. Reconstitution of primary leukemia cells showed that these tumors express high densities of the B-cell surface proteins CD19 and CD38, which are EBF targets. Using a transactivation assay, we show that the terminal six zinc-fingers of Evi3 are required for modification of EBF activity. This is the first evidence that Evi3 expression in tumors alters the level of EBF target genes, and the first characterization of the Evi3 protein domains required for modulation of EBF activity. Further, these data imply that Evi3 misexpression initiates tumorigenesis by perturbing B-cell development via an interaction with EBF."

Colonoscopy, an effective but invasive screening test, has been limited in its public acceptance. The goal of this study was to identify novel serum markers of colon cancers and precancerous colon adenomas as potential candidates for noninvasive detection of early colon neoplasms. Employing expression microarrays, we identified colon cancer secreted protein-2 (CCSP-2) as a novel transcript whose expression is generally absent in normal colon and other normal body tissues, but that is induced an average of 78-fold in Stage II, III, and IV colon cancers, as well as in colon adenomas and colon cancer cell lines. These findings were validated by real-time PCR analysis in an independent panel of colon cancer cases. Moreover, CCSP-2 was shown to encode a secreted protein that circulates stably and is detectable in the blood of mice bearing human cancer xenografts transfected with epitope-tagged CCSP-2. As a novel secreted protein that is markedly induced in colon adenomas and cancers, CCSP-2 is a novel candidate for development as a diagnostic serum marker of early stage colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2037317845,"Net (Elk-3, Sap-2, Erp) and the related ternary complex factors Elk-1 and Sap-1 are effectors of multiple signalling pathways at the transcriptional level and play a key role in the dynamic regulation of gene expression. Net is distinct from Elk-1 and Sap-1, in that it is a strong repressor of transcription that is converted to an activator by the Ras/Erk signalling pathway. Two autonomous repression domains of Net, the NID and the CID, mediate repression. We have previously shown that the co-repressor CtBP is implicated in repression by the CID. In this report we show that repression by the NID involves a different pathway, sumoylation by Ubc9 and PIAS1. PIAS1 interacts with the NID in the two-hybrid assay and in vitro. Ubc9 and PIAS1 stimulate sumoylation in vivo of lysine 162 in the NID. Sumoylation of lysine 162 increases repression by Net and decreases the positive activity of Net. These results increase our understanding of how one of the ternary complex factors regulates transcription, and contribute to the understanding of how different domains of a transcription factor participate in the complexity of regulation of gene expression."

Mutations in TPP I lead to classic late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease. TPP I proenzyme is converted in lysosomes into a mature enzyme with the assistance of another protease and is able to autoactivate in acidic pH in vitro via a unimolecular mechanism. Because autoactivation in vitro at the pH values reported for lysosomes generated inactive enzyme, we intended to determine whether physiologically relevant factors can modify this process to also make it plausible in vivo. Here, we report that high ionic strength and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) increase yields (ionic strength) or yields and rates (GAGs) of activation, enhance degradation of liberated TPP I prosegment fragments, and switch effective autoactivation of TPP I proenzyme toward less acidic pH values (up to pH 6.0). Although ionic strength and GAGs also inhibited TPP I activity in vitro and in living cells, the degree of inhibition (from 20 to 60%) appears to be of rather limited functional significance. Importantly, binding to GAGs improved thermal stability of TPP I and protected the enzyme against alkaline pH-induced denaturation in vitro (t½ of mature enzyme at pH 7.4 increased by ∼8-fold in the presence of heparin) and in vivo (∼2-fold higher loss of TPP I in cells deficient in GAGs than in control cells after bafilomycin A1 treatment).

However, TPP I degrades in vitro several neuropeptides and peptide hormones including glucagon, substance P, sulfated cholecystokinin-8, angiotensin II and III, and neuromedin B (4Vines D.

Given that TPP I releases Gly-Pro-X triplets from synthetic collagen-like polymers and that an inhibitor of TPP I inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption in vitro, it was also proposed that TPP I is involved in the degradation of bone collagen (3Page A.E. Fuller K. Chambers T.J. Warburton M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 354-359Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently, decreased expression of TPP I was found in fibroblasts from lung fibrosis (19Waldburg N. Kahne T. Reisenauer A. Rocken C. Welte T. Buhling F. Pathol. Res. Pract. 2004; 200: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas increased TPP I immunoreactivity was disclosed in some neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and lysosomal storage disorders as well as several types of neoplasms (12Kida E.

Interestingly, from 2- to 17-fold, higher TPP I activity was reported in breast cancer, which correlated positively with the levels of cathepsin D, a known breast cancer biomarker (20Junaid M.A. Clark G.M. Pullarkat R.K. Int. J. Biol. Markers. 2000; 15: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that TPP I is involved in numerous vital biological processes and its activity is critical for the proper function and survival of the neuronal cells in the central nervous system.Human TPP I cDNA encodes a preproenzyme of 563 amino acid residues, which includes a 19-amino acid signal peptide cleaved off cotranslationally, a 176-amino acid prodomain removed during the maturation process, and a mature enzyme of 368 amino acid residues (7Sleat D.E.

The enzyme utilizes in vivo all five potential N-glycosylation sites, and N-glycans ensure proper folding, stability, and transport of TPP I to lysosomes (24Wujek P. Kida E. Walus M. Wisniewski K.E. Golabek A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12827-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cleavage of TPP I prodomain in vivo takes place in lysosomes and appears to be facilitated by 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride-sensitive serine protease (23Golabek A.A.

Similar to many other proteases, TPP I is also able to autoactivate in acidic pH in vitro (22Lin L. Sohar I. Lackland H. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2249-2255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which as we have shown recently is accomplished through an intramolecular (in cis) mechanism (25Golabek A.A Wujek P.

Autoprocessing of pro-TPP I in vitro and generation of the mature enzyme can be carried out in a broad range of pH values up to 6.2 (depending on the type of buffer used). However, the acquisition of enzymatic activity in vitro proceeds in a narrow pH range (usually 3.6–4.2) and the mature, inactive enzyme generated during pro-TPP I autoactivation at higher pH (4.5 and above) contains N-terminal extensions starting at 6 and 14 amino acid residues upstream of the prosegment/mature enzyme junction. All of these data suggested that a lysosomal milieu with pH values usually in the range of 4.5–5.5 (26Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar, 27Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Vergne I. Constant P.

Here, we report that physiologically relevant factors, namely ionic strength and negatively charged compounds (glycosaminoglycans or GAGs), modulate the activation and activity of TPP I both in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrate that binding to GAGs improves the thermal stability of TPP I and significantly protects the enzyme against alkaline pH-induced denaturation. These data show a potent influence of GAGs on the biology of TPP I and also suggest that human enzyme can utilize in vivo both in cis and in trans mechanisms of activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Heparin (sodium salt, Mr 6,000–30,000 and 3,000), dextran sulfate (Mr 8,000, 60,000, and 500,000), heparan sulfate (from bovine kidney), dermatan sulfate (chondroitin sulfate B from porcine intestinal mucosa), and poly-l-lysine (Mr 14,400) were purchased from Sigma. Cell culture components were from Invitrogen. Western blotting reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad and Amersham Biosciences. Protease inhibitor mixture (Complete) and FuGENE 6 transfection reagent were from Roche Applied Science. The endoproteolytic substrate peptide MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro-Ile-Pro-Phe-Arg-Leu-Lys-(Dnp)-r-NH2 (peptide 1) (5Ezaki J. Takeda-Ezaki M. Oda K. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

All other chemicals were from Sigma.Purification of Human pro-TPP I—Human pro-TPP I was purified from serum-free secretions of CHO-DHFRneg cells (ATCC CRL-9096) stably transfected with plasmid encoding the full-length human pro-TPP I as described earlier (25Golabek A.A Wujek P.

Electrophoretically separated proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were subsequently blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% Tween 20, incubated overnight with mAb anti-TPP I, washed extensively in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:5,000, and developed by using the ECL.Time-course Analysis of Pro-TPP I Activation and Processing—Unless otherwise indicated, 2× concentrated stock solutions of purified pro-TPP I at the concentration specified in the figure legends (final concentrations) were prepared in 2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, mixed at 0 time with an equal volume of 200 mm sodium acetate (activation buffer), and maintained either at room temperature (25 °C) or 37 °C. At the indicated time, an aliquot of 10 μl was withdrawn and combined with either 10 μl of 0.5 m NaOH (for Western blot analysis) or 40 μl of 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (for TPP I activity measurement).TPP I Activity Measurement—Unless otherwise stated, TPP I activity was measured in the presence of 100 μm substrate Ala-Ala-Pheaminomethylcoumarin (AAF-AMC), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, in a total volume of 100 μl. TPP I activity measurement at pH 5.0 was selected to ensure that no further activation took place while TPP I activity was assessed (25Golabek A.A Wujek P. Walus M. Bieler S. Soto C. Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31058-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 20 min and was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 10% SDS. Released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured fluorometrically on CytoFluor 2000 (Applied Biosystems) (excitation wavelength 360 nm, emission wavelength 460 nm) after alkalizing the solution by adding 50 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0.Determination of Kinetic Parameters—For each kinetic assay, seven serially diluted substrate concentrations were used. Both enzyme and substrate were prewarmed at 37 °C for 5 min, were mixed afterward, and incubated for 10 min. The reaction was terminated thereafter, as above. The linear rate of fluorescence change was measured to give the initial velocity (V). The Km and Vmax values were calculated by nonlinear regression fit of initial velocity versus substrate to Michaelis-Menten equation with the help of GraphPad Prism software. The kcat values were derived from the equation, Vmax = kcat [E], where [E] is the enzyme concentration.Heparin-Agarose Affinity Chromatography—TPP I obtained by activation of pro-TPP I (at 2.5 μm) for 2 h at pH 3.5 and 37 °C was diluted 10-fold with the column equilibration buffer at the desired pH and analyzed on a 1-ml HiTrap (Amersham Biosciences) column custom-filled with heparin-agarose resin (Bio-Rad) and used at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Automated method scouting was used to achieve a desired buffer pH by using ÄKTA Explorer high pressure liquid chromatography, Unicorn software (both from Amersham Biosciences), and the following solutions: (a) 0.03 m Na2HPO4, 0.03 m sodium formate, and 0.03 m sodium acetate; (b) 0.1 m HCl; (c) H2O; and (d)2 m NaCl, each containing 0.05% Triton X-100. The pH of the buffer was verified after each run by manual measurement. After a wash, a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m) over 20 min was used to elute the retained protein. Collected fractions (0.8 ml each) were monitored for TPP I enzymatic activity upon AAF-AMC substrate.Cell Culture and Transfection—Control Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO K1, ATCC CCL-61) and CHO cells deficient in xylosyltransferase 1 (pgsA-745, ATCC CRL-2242) were maintained in Ham's F-12 growth medium supplemented by 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. One day before transfection, cells were seeded on 35-mm culture dishes. Cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding wild-type human pro-TPP I cloned into the KpnI/NotI site of pcDNA3.1Hygro as described earlier (23Golabek A.A. Kida E. Walus M. Wujek P. Mehta P. Wisniewski K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7135-7145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) by using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendation. 72 h after transfections, bafilomycin A1 was added to the culture media for 3 and 6 h (final concentration 100 nm) and then cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete) supplemented with pepstatin A (lysis buffer) and TPP I was assessed by using Western blotting and enzymatic activity assay.TPP I Uptake Experiments—For standard uptake assays, confluent CHO K1 and CHO pgsA-745 cells plated in 35-mm Petri dishes were rinsed twice with 2 ml of F-12 medium and then were maintained for 4 and 24 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM I) containing 10 μg/ml human pro-TPP I. Afterward, cells were washed in PBS, harvested with trypsin/EDTA solution to remove cell membrane-associated pro-TPP I, centrifuged twice at 2,000 × g for 2 min (first in full medium and then in PBS), and lysed as above.RESULTSThe Effect of Ionic Strength on Autoactivation of Pro-TPP I—It was demonstrated that, during the activation of numerous zymogens including pepsinogen, procongopain, and yeast proteinase A, the reaction rate is a function of ionic strength (31McPhie P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4277-4281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Van Den Hazel H. Wolff A.M. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. Biochem.

Chem. 2003; 384: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of TPP I proenzyme (∼5.91) is similar to the predicted pI of the prosegment (∼6.12, excluding 19-amino acid signal peptide), the charge density of the prosegment polypeptide is distinctly higher than that of the mature TPP I. Thus, similarly to other lysosomal proenzymes, multiple salt bridges between the prosegment and the mature enzyme might form, stabilizing the prosegment-mature enzyme complex in its zymogen form. To study the role of ionic interactions in stabilization of the prosegment-mature enzyme complex in its zymogen form, we first analyzed the autoactivation of the pro-TPP I in the presence of NaCl at 0, 150, or 1,000 mm in the pH range of 3.5–6.0 for 15 and 120 min. As illustrated in Fig. 1, pro-TPP I was fully activated at pH 3.5 after only 15 min of activation in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, independent of NaCl concentration. In the presence of 1 m NaCl (but not 150 mm NaCl), significant activation also was observed at pH 4.0 (Fig. 1, left panel). After 120 min of incubation, the activation of pro-TPP I in vitro at pH 4.0 was still very limited without the addition of salt to the reaction buffer (Fig. 1, right panel). However, at this pH, the enzyme was fully activated in the presence of 1 m NaCl and significantly activated in the presence of 150 mm NaCl. Under the experimental conditions employed, no pro-TPP I activation was observed at pH 4.5 and above, irrespective of NaCl concentration. These data, in agreement with our earlier observations (25Golabek A.A Wujek P. Walus M. Bieler S. Soto C. Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31058-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), demonstrate that pro-TPP I activation in vitro takes place in a narrow pH range and show that, although a high ionic strength environment can enhance the activation at pH 4.0, it cannot initiate activation at pH higher than that.Activation of pro-TPP I in vitro is characterized by exponential kinetics at pH 3.5 and sigmoidal kinetics at pH 4.0 (25Golabek A.A Wujek P.

To determine whether ionic strength can affect the kinetics of pro-TPP I activation, we analyzed in greater details the activation of pro-TPP I as a function of time and NaCl concentration by using a discontinuous method. As depicted in Fig. 2 (left panel), the kinetics of pro-TPP I autoactivation at pH 3.5 only slightly inversely correlated with salt concentration. Although increased NaCl concentrations somewhat reduced the rates of activation (which might have resulted from the direct effect of NaCl on TPP I activity (see below)), the overall yield of active TPP I was not dependent on ionic strength. In contrast, the rates of pro-TPP I activation at pH 4.0 were independent of the ionic strength of the buffer (Fig. 2, right panel); however, the yield of the active enzyme strongly correlated with salt concentration (Fig. 2, right panel, inset) and NaCl at 1 m led to an ∼8-fold increase in the amount of active enzyme generated in comparison to control samples incubated in 100 mm acetate buffer without the addition of NaCl. Interestingly, the sigmoidal activation curve characteristic for pro-TPP I activated at pH 4.0 (25Golabek A.A Wujek P. Walus M. Bieler S. Soto C. Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31058-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was preserved even in the highest NaCl concentration. These data suggest that ionic strength affects the yields but not the rates or the mechanism of pro-TPP I activation in vitro.Fig. 2Kinetics of pro-TPP I activation in vitro at pH 3.5 and 4.0 as a function of NaCl concentration. Pro-TPP I was activated in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 mm sodium acetate and either pH 3.5 and concentration 12.5 nm at RT (left panel) or pH 4.0 and concentration 25 nm at 37 °C (right panel) in the presence of varying salt concentrations as labeled. At the time points indicated, an aliquot was withdrawn and analyzed for TPP I activity. Data points were fit to either two-phase exponential association equation (left panel) or sigmoidal equation (right panel).

Commun. 2000; 268: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the ionic strength might directly affect the activity of TPP I, the activity of mature TPP I was assayed in the presence of various NaCl concentrations at pH 3.5, 4.0, and 5.0. As illustrated in Fig. 3, NaCl slightly inhibited TPP I activity. In addition, at any given NaCl concentration, the inhibition of TPP I activity was the highest at pH 5.0 and then at 4.0 and 3.5. However, even at pH 5.0 and 2 m NaCl, there was only a ∼22% decrease in TPP I activity in comparison with control samples assayed without NaCl.Fig. 3The effect of NaCl on TPP I activity in vitro. Pro-TPP I at a concentration 12.5 nm was preactivated in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.5, for 2 h at 37 °C. Afterward, serially diluted NaCl at concentrations indicated were added to the reaction mixture for 5 min and TPP I activity was measured at pH 3.5, 4.0, and 5.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Effect of GAGs on Pro-TPP I Maturation in Vitro—It was demonstrated that negatively charged compounds, such as dextran sulfate (DS), are able to accelerate the processing of several lysosomal enzymes including cathepsins B and L (34Mason R.W.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hence, we first have tested the effect of the selected model polyanions (DS and heparin) on pro-TPP I maturation in vitro and compared it to the effect of a positively charged compound, poly-l-lysine. To this end, we studied the activation of pro-TPP I incubated for either 15 or 120 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of tested compounds as a function of pH (3.5–6.0). As illustrated in Fig. 4A, the effect of polyanions on pro-TPP I strongly depended on the pH of the activation solution. At pH 3.5, both heparin and DS inhibited pro-TPP I activation after 15 min but not after 120 min of incubation. However, at pH 4.0 and 4.5, pro-TPP I activation occurred exclusively in the presence of DS and heparin under the experimental conditions used. During incubation of pro-TPP I with DS, an active TPP I was generated up to pH 5.5. The effect of heparin and DS on pro-TPP I activation was not dependent on the molecular size of GAGs tested (data not shown). Incubation with poly-l-lysine had no effect on pro-TPP I activation. Hence, both DS and heparin stimulated significantly the activation of pro-TPP I in vitro, and in their presence, autoactivation of pro-TPP I was possible in pH higher by approximately one unit t"

https://openalex.org/W2090770397,"The physiological role and activation mechanism for most proteins of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family are unknown. This is also the case for the highly Ca(2+) selective transient receptor potential vanilloid type 6 (TRPV6) channel. Patch clamp experiments were performed on transiently transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells to address this issue. Currents were recorded under various conditions of intracellular Ca(2+) buffering and monitored at the same voltage throughout. No TRPV6-mediated Ca(2+) entry was detected under in vivo Ca(2+) buffering conditions at a slightly negative holding potential; however, moderate depolarization resulted in current activation. Very similar results were obtained with different Ca(2+) chelators, either EGTA or BAPTA dialyzing the cell. TRPV6 channel activity showed a negative correlation with the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and was modulated by the membrane potential: Hyperpolarization decreases and depolarization increases TRPV6-mediated currents. Monovalent ions permeated TRPV6 channels in the absence of extracellular divalent cations. These currents were resistant to changes in the holding potential while the negative correlation to the [Ca(2+)](i) was conserved, indicating that the voltage-dependent current changes depend on blocking and unblocking the charge carrier Ca(2+) within the pore. In summary, these results suggest that the voltage dependence of TRPV6-mediated Ca(2+) influx is of physiological importance since it occurs at cytosolic Ca(2+) buffering and takes place within a physiologically relevant membrane potential range."
