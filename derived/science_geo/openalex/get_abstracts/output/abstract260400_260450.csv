We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether younger and older adults differed in both self-reported and neural responsiveness to anticipated monetary gains and losses. The present study provides evidence for intact striatal and insular activation during gain anticipation with age, but shows a relative reduction in activation during loss anticipation. These findings suggest that there is an asymmetry in the processing of gains and losses in older adults that may have implications for decision-making."

In particular, the appearance of PS at the cell surface, a hallmark of apoptosis, prepares the dying cell for engulfment and elimination by phagocytes. While it is well established that PS externalization is regulated by activation of a calcium-dependent phospholipid scramblase activity in concert with inactivation of the aminophospholipid translocase, there is no evidence indicating that these processes are triggered and regulated by apoptotic regulatory mechanisms. Using a novel model system, we show that PS externalization is inducible, reversible, and independent of cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and DNA fragmentation. Additional evidence is presented indicating that the outward movement of plasma membrane PS requires sustained elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ in concert with inactivation of the aminophospholipid translocase and is inhibited by calcium channel blockers.

Apoptosis, senescence, and necrosis are distinct cell death mechanisms in normal physiology and during pathological duress. Irrespective of mechanism, and with very few exceptions (1Elliott J.I.

This serves as a specific recruitment signal for phagocyte docking and subsequent engulfment and degradation of the apoptotic cell (2Balasubramanian K. Schroit A.J. Annu. Rev.

Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). PS externalization is critical to this process, since its absence results in impaired recognition and clearance of apoptotic debris that can lead to inflammatory and autoimmune responses (5Gaipl U.S. Voll R.E. Sheriff A. Franz S. Kalden J.R. Herrmann M. Autoimmun. Rev. 2005; 4: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 6Kuhtreiber W.M. Hayashi T. Dale E.A. Faustman D.L. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 373-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells have an asymmetric transbilayer distribution of phospholipids such that most of the PS is localized at the inner membrane leaflet. This asymmetry is maintained by the activity of lipid-specific transporters that regulate the distribution of PS between bilayer leaflets, a process that is Ca2+-dependent (7Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 8Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 971-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lipid transport studies in (organelle-free) erythrocytes have shown that sulfhydryl-modifying reagents do not induce the outward movement of PS (9Connor J. Pak C.H. Zwaal R.F. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19412-19417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results are in sharp contrast to more recent observations demonstrating that nucleated cells externalize PS upon sulfhydryl modification (10van Engeland M. Kuijpers H.J. Ramaekers F.C. Reutelingsperger C.P. Schutte B. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 11Fadeel B. Gleiss B. Hogstrand K. Chandra J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Henter J.I. Orrenius S. Samali A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This suggests that the appearance of PS at the cell surface is regulated by specific intracellular signaling events that are absent in erythrocytes. It is generally accepted that PS externalization during apoptosis occurs downstream to cytochrome c (cyt c) release. There is, however, no direct evidence indicating that cyt c release, caspase activation, or DNA fragmentation is related to, or responsible for PS exposure. In this study, we show that PS externalization can be specifically induced and reversed by a mechanism that is distinct and separable from other hallmarks of apoptosis and operates through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism that is inhibited by calcium channel blockers, suggesting involvement of L-type Ca2+ channels. The human T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat and the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (CM). Red blood cells (RBC) were isolated from blood collected from healthy volunteers. The blood was centrifuged and the buffy coat removed, and the RBC were washed with TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 20 mm glucose (TBSG) and resuspended in the same buffer. RBC studies presented in this manuscript were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board. Jurkat and K562 cells (106/ml in CM) or RBC (2% hematocrit in TBSG) were incubated at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) or pyridyldithioethylamine (PDA). After 15 min the cells were washed and resuspended in TBSG. Jurkat and K562 cells in CM, and RBC in TBSG, were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with A23187 at 1 and 2 μm, respectively, in the absence or presence of varying Ca2+ concentrations. The ionophore was removed by centrifuging the cells through ice cold BSA (1%) followed by washing twice with TBSG. Cells (106/ml) were triggered into apoptosis by treatment with Fas antibody (clone CH-11, 0.25 μg/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells incubated with Fas antibody or sulfhydryl reagents were tested for expression of the following apoptotic markers; for PS externalization (FITC-annexin V binding), cells (106) were incubated for 10 min at 20 °C in 0.5 ml of TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 μl FITC-annexin V (Trevigen) and 0.5 μl propidium iodide (PI, 1 mg/ml), followed by FACS analysis. 3The use of annexin V to monitor PS externalization requires millimolar concentrations of Ca2+. However, incubation of cells with Ca2+ and annexin V alone did not result in PS externalization as observed by microscopy and by flow cytometry. Furthermore, after removal of ionophore from RBC incubated with increasing concentrations of Ca2+/ionophore, the addition of FITC-annexin V/2mM Ca2+ showed progressive alterations in PS distribution that was dependent only on the initial Ca2+/ionophore treatment (Fig. 6, C and D). Photomicrographs of annexin V binding were recorded by incubating the cells in Ca2+ containing buffer with phycoerythrin-labeled annexin V for 10 min followed by washing the cells in Ca2+ containing buffer to remove excess probe. For DNA fragmentation (PI/cell cycle analysis): cells (106) were fixed in 70% ethanol, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with RNase (1 μg/ml) followed by incubation with PI (50 μg/ml) prior to flow cytometry. For mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψmt), cells (106) in CM were labeled for 10 min at 20 °C with 10 μg of 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1). Unlabeled dye was removed by washing twice with TBS prior to fluorescence measurements (λex = 488 nm, λem1=534nm, λem2=594nm). Relative changes to Ψmt were expressed as the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 594 nm (red, high Ψmt) and 534 nm (green, low Ψmt). For cyt c release, cells incubated with thiol reagents or Fas antibody were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeablized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with cyt c monoclonal antibody. Antibody binding was assessed with FITC labeled anti-mouse IgG. Images were recorded using a Carl-Zeiss LSN510 confocal microscope. Buffers used in Ca2+ measurements were routinely tested for the presence of trace amounts of Ca2+ with the calcium sensitive fluorimetric reagent Calcium Green-1 and appropriate Ca2+ standards (Invitrogen) and chelated with equimolar concentrations of EGTA. Jurkat cells (106 in CM) were incubated for 30 min with 1 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2AM; Invitrogen) at 37 °C in the presence or absence of EGTA-AM (100 μm). The cells were then washed with TBSG and resuspended in the same buffer for fluorescence measurements. For inhibitor studies, labeled cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with the indicated inhibitors prior to analysis. For real-time Ca2+ measurements, the ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence (R) at λem1=340nm and λem2=380nm (λem = 510 nm) were measured following the addition of thiol reagent. At the end of the experiment, the cells were solubilized with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and the fluorescence ratios recorded (Rmax). This was followed by addition of 2 mm EGTA (Rmin). Cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration were calculated using the formula [Ca2+](nm) = 140 × (R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R) (Invitrogen product manual). Photomicrographs of cytosolic Ca2+ in control and apoptotic cells were recorded by incubating the cells with 1 μm Calcium Green-1-AM for 1 h at 37 °C followed by washing the cells to remove excess probe. Inward Lipid Transport (Flip)—RBC (2% hematocrit) and Jurkat cells (106 cells/ml) were incubated with inhibitors or sulfhydryl reagents for 15 min at 37 °C followed by incubation with 6-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl-1-phosphatidylserine (NBD-PS) or -phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PC) (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C. At the indicated time intervals, aliquots (150 μl) of the cell suspension were set aside for determining total NBD-lipid or centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 3 min through 1 ml of ice-cold 1% BSA to remove NBD-lipids at the outer membrane leaflet. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellets were solubilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in TBS for fluorescence measurements. Transport of PS to the inner leaflet was expressed as the rate of increase in NBD fluorescence in the cell pellets. Outward Lipid Transport (Flop)—RBC (2% hematocrit) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with NBD-PS (1 μg/ml) to enable transport to the inner leaflet of the cells. Residual lipid at the outer leaflet was removed by centrifuging the cells through ice-cold 1% BSA followed by washing twice with ice-cold TBSG. NBD-PS-labeled cells were then incubated with inhibitors (varying concentration), sulfhydryl reagents (0.5 mm), or A23187 (2 μm) in the presence of Ca2+ (varying concentrations) for 1 h at 37 °C. Aliquots of the cell suspension were processed as described above for inward transport. Transport of PS to the outer leaflet was expressed as the fraction of total NBD fluorescence removed by back exchange with BSA. Data were analyzed using the graphical data analysis software packages, Microsoft Excel (Seattle, WA) and SlideWrite Plus (Encinitas, CA). Data presented are mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Effect of Sulfhydryl-modifying Agents on PS Asymmetry—Human RBC, the RBC progenitor cell line, K562, and Jurkat cells were tested for their ability to externalize PS when incubated with sufhydryl reactive reagents. Fig. 1A shows that about 60% of the Jurkat cells treated with NEM or PDA (12Connor J. Schroit A.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) expressed PS as determined by their ability to bind annexin V. K562 cells responded similarly; however, the same reagents were without effect on mature red cells (Fig. 1B). The inability of RBC to respond to PDA or NEM was not due to a specific loss in outward PS transport activity since elevation of intracellular Ca2+ with calcium ionophore (A23187) resulted in PS externalization (Fig. 1B). Effect of Sulfhydryl-modifying Agents on the Appearance of Apoptotic Markers—Execution of programmed cell death results in the sequential display of several biochemical markers that include PS externalization, cyt c release, and activation of caspases and DNase. To determine whether treatment with sulfhydryl reagents triggers any of these apoptosis related processes, the effect of NEM and/or PDA on these events were investigated. Fig. 2 shows that incubation of Jurkat cells (and K562 cells; data not shown) with PDA or NEM did not result in the release of cyt c from the mitochondria into the cytosol (Fig. 2A) or trigger DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, while Fas antibody induced PS externalization was blocked by the pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, sulfhydryl reagent triggered PS exposure was unaffected by this inhibitor (Fig. 2C). These data raise the possibility that pathways that lead to PS externalization are distinct from those that activate other hallmarks of apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that sulfhydryl modification can be a useful tool for analyzing mechanisms of PS exposure without triggering the apoptotic cascade. PS Externalization Is Regulated by Cytosolic Ca2+ Levels—Studies with RBC have shown that elevated cytosolic Ca2+ leads to the appearance of PS at the cells outer leaflet (13Lang K.S. Duranton C. Poehlmann H. Myssina S. Bauer C. Lang F. Wieder T. Huber S.M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 14Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Harmsma M. Zwaal R.F. Lupus. 1998; 7: S126-S131Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed effects of sulfhydryl modification is a result of altered cytosolic Ca2+, Jurkat cells were incubated with the cytosolic Ca2+ probe, Fura-2AM, and alterations in Ca2+ levels were assessed by real-time fluorescence spectroscopy following addition of the thiol reagents. Fig. 3 shows that treatment of the cells with NEM resulted in a rapid elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 3A) that correlated with an increase in the fraction of annexin V-positive cells (Fig. 3B). This Ca2+ is from intracellular stores and not from the medium, since similar changes in Ca2+ levels were obtained with cells incubated in EGTA containing buffer (data not shown). The importance of intracellular Ca2+ to PS externalization is further emphasized by the observation that incubation of cells with the cell-permeable calcium chelator, EGTA-AM, reduced both cytosolic Ca2+ levels and the fraction of annexin V-positive cells by ∼50% (Fig. 3B, inset). To determine whether PS externalization during apoptosis is Ca2+ dependent, Jurkat cells were incubated with Fas antibody in the presence and absence of z-VAD-fmk. The cells were analyzed for both PS externalization and cytosolic Ca2+ at the indicated time intervals. Fig. 3, C and D, show that the increase in annexin V-positive cells correlated with the increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ and that both events were blocked when the incubation was carried out in the presence of z-VAD-fmk. It should be noted that while the maximal increase in cytosolic Ca2+ during apoptosis is ∼50% lower than with NEM, the fraction of annexin V-positive cells remain the same. This is likely attributed to differences in the kinetics and mechanism of Ca2+ release with NEM and Fas antibody and due to prolonged incubation times (1-6 h for Fas antibody versus 15 min for NEM) that might render the plasma membrane permeable to Ca2+ as apoptosis ensues. Since PDA is a reducible thiol-disulfide exchange reagent, PDA-induced disulfides should regenerate to free sulfhydryls by treatment with reducing agents. Fig. 4, A-C, show that PDA-induced, but not NEM-induced, PS exposure and elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ were both reversed with dithiothreitol. PS Externalization Requires Sustained Elevation of Cytosolic Ca2+—The data presented above suggest that a direct association exists between elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels and PS externalization. Interestingly, thapsigargin (TG) mediated release of Ca2+ from the ER into the cytosol (15Young H.S. Stokes D.L. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 198: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) failed to yield annexin V positive cells. Comparison of changes to cytosolic Ca2+ levels with Fura-2 revealed that while NEM treatment elicited a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+, treatment with TG produced a transient increase that returned to basal levels within ∼8 min (Fig. 5A). The sustained presence of Ca2+ in the cytosol following NEM treatment could be due to compromised mitochondrial buffering capacity as a result of loss in mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψmt) (16Herrington J. Park Y.B. Babcock D.F. Hille B. Neuron. 1996; 16: 219-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 17Sheu S.S. Sharma V.K. J. Physiol.

Biochem. 2004; 256-257: 209-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, cells labeled with JC-1 exhibited a significant decrease in Ψmt when incubated with NEM but not with TG (Fig. 5B). Thiol Reagents Inhibit Inward PS Transport—To investigate the possible differential effects of thiol reagents on directional (inward and outward) PS transport, the movement of exogenously supplied NBD-PS from the outer-to-inner leaflet was monitored in control and NEM-treated RBC and Jurkat cells. Table 1 shows that the inward movement of NBD-PS is blocked in both cell types. As shown previously (12Connor J. Schroit A.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), NEM had no effect on the outward movement of NBD-PS in RBC. Outward movements of NBD-PS could not be monitored in Jurkat cells, since after internalization virtually all the lipid was metabolized to other lipid species (mostly NBD-phosphatidic acid) (20Sleight R.G. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Effect of thiolation on directional PS transportPS transport (% ± S.E., n = 3)at = 15 min.Inwardbp < 0.01.Outwardcp ≥ 0.01.ControlNEMControlNEMRBC39.4 ± 7.56.3 ± 1.52.6 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.3Jurkat46.5 ± 1.018.2 ± 8.5NDdND, not determined.NDa t = 15 min.b p < 0.01.c p ≥ 0.01.d ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Inward PS Transport by Ca2+—The data presented above suggest that elevated intracellular Ca2+ plays a critical role in the vectorial transport of PS to the cell surface. To investigate the role of intracellular Ca2+ on inward lipid movements, RBC were loaded with Ca2+ by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h with A23187 (2 μm) and Ca2+ (200 μm). These cells were then incubated with NBD-PC or NBD-PS, and internalization of the lipids was monitored at 37 °C by back exchange to BSA at the indicated time intervals. Fig. 6 shows that, similar to NEM mediated inhibition of NBD-PS transport (Fig. 6A), elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels also inhibited inward PS movement (Fig. 6B) albeit with concomitant scrambling of both lipid species. This is clearly evident by the fact that transbilayer distributions of both PS and PC leveled off at ∼50%. This effect was clearly Ca2+-dependent since cells incubated with A23187 in the presence of increasing Ca2+ (0.1-5 μm) demonstrated a concomitant decrease in the fraction of PS transported to the inner leaflet (Fig. 6C). Beyond 10 μm Ca2+, however, inhibition of inward movement was superseded by activation of scrambling that resulted in complete randomization of NBD-PS across both leaflets. It should be noted that unlike the inward movement, outward NBD-PS transport increases as a function of Ca2+ concentration until a 50% distribution of the lipid across the bilayer is achieved (21Williamson P. Kulick A. Zachowski A. Schlegel R.A. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To determine the relationship between thiolation, Ca2+, and PS externalization, control and NEM-treated RBC were incubated with A23187 and increasing amounts of Ca2+. Similar to data reported earlier (22de Jong K. Rettig M.P. Low P.S. Kuypers F.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12562-12567Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), pretreatment of RBC with NEM reduced the concentrations of Ca2+ required for half-maximal PS externalization by ∼2-fold (Fig. 6D). Thiol Reagent-induced PS Externalization Is Inhibited by L-type Ca2+ Channel Blockers—Since plasma membrane L-type channels are involved in Ca2+ transport into the cytosol, and elevated cytosolic Ca2+ is central to increasing the cell surface pools of PS, we determined whether L-type channel blockers affected sulfhydryl reagent-induced PS externalization. Jurkat cells were incubated with several structurally distinct inhibitors of L-type Ca2+ channels prior to the addition of NEM. Fig. 7A shows that preincubation with verapamil, nifedipine, or diltiazem inhibited NEM-induced PS externalization. Inhibition was unlikely because of direct intercalation of positively charged amphipaths to the membrane (23Moreau C. Sulpice J.C. Devaux P.F. Zachowski A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1997; 14: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), since control experiments with the positively charged chlorpromazine did not result in inhibition of NEM induced PS externalization (data not shown). Interestingly, measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ in cells preincubated with L-type channel inhibitors showed that these reagents did not affect NEM induced changes to intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 7B). This suggests that the observed inhibition in PS externalization in the presence of these compounds was due to a heretofore unreported mechanism that is directly or indirectly regulated by plasma membrane L-type Ca2+ channels. Additional evidence for the involvement of L-type Ca2+ channels in PS externalization was obtained from results showing that these compounds also inhibited the outward movement of NBD-PS in RBC (Fig. 7C). Moreover, since the inhibitors did not affect the inward movement of NBD-PS (data not shown) their effects were not a result of direct inhibitor-lipid interactions. It is generally accepted that the appearance of PS on cell surfaces is an early indication of apoptosis. There are, however, several reports of transient PS expression in viable non-apoptotic cells (1Elliott J.I. Surprenant A. Marelli-Berg F.M. Cooper J.C. Cassady-Cain R.L. Wooding C. Linton K. Alexander D.R. Higgins C.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 808-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 2Balasubramanian K. Schroit A.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 701-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This purports the existence of PS externalization mechanisms that are not under direct apoptotic control. In an effort to define the mechanism responsible for PS externalization, we developed an inducible experimental system that triggers transbilayer PS movements. We show that PS externalization can occur through a mechanism that is independent of cyt c release, caspase activation, and DNA fragmentation, events unique to apoptosis. In contrast, PS externalization during apoptosis requires caspase activity since Jurkat cells treated with z-VAD-fmk fail to yield annexin V positive cells following incubation with Fas antibody. Although these data might indicate that apoptosis and thiolation-dependent PS externalization occur through independent mechanisms, it is possible that caspase activation results in ER and/or mitochondrial stress leading to the release of Ca2+ to the cytosol during apoptosis (24Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 25Momoi T. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thiolation may directly activate a stress response that leads to a surge of Ca2+ into the cytosol, thereby circumventing any requirement of caspases (Fig. 8). Such a mechanism could explain the observed independence of PS externalization from cyt c release and DNA fragmentation since both of these steps are caspase-dependent (25Momoi T. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 26Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Janssen O. Kabelitz D. Immunol. Res. 2005; 33: 149-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). While caspases might not directly contribute to PS externalization our data does not rule out the possibility or other proteases playing a role in this process. Resting cells have an intracellular Ca2+ distribution where most of the cation is sequestered in the ER with only nanomolar amounts (∼20 nm for Jurkat cells) present in the cytosol. One of the early events following the induction of apoptosis is the release of ER Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. Although this signaling is crucial to progression of the cell death cascade, it is not clear whether the ER and/or other intracellular organelles have any direct role in PS externalization. This is underscored by observations that RBC, cells that lack intracellular organelles, do not undergo classical apoptosis; yet externalize PS as a phagocyte recognition signal (4Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Using RBC and Jurkat cells as a model, we showed that the inability of RBC to externalize PS in response to thiol modification is because of their inability to recruit Ca2+ to the cytosol. Indeed, this condition was reversed by ionophore mediated Ca2+ loading. Unlike RBC, however, Jurkat and K562 have relatively high amounts of Ca2+ sequestered in the ER through the action Ca2+-ATPases (24Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 28Strehler E.E. Treiman M. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is likely that incubation of these cells with sulfhydryl reagents compromises the ability of the ER to retain its Ca2+ which results in leakage of the cation to the cytosol leading to an increase in the PS pool at the exofacial leaflet. Interestingly, treatment of cells with the ER-specific Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, TG, also led to an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ but failed to result in PS externalization. Analysis of Ψmt and cytosolic Ca2+ in NEM- and TG-treated cells showed that, while NEM resulted in a significant drop in Ψmt and sustained levels of cytosolic Ca2+, TG had no effect on Ψmt and resulted in a rapid increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that was restored to basal levels within ∼8 min. This suggests that the rapid restoration of cytosolic Ca2+ to basal levels was due to its sequestration to the mitochondria (16Herrington J. Park Y.B. Babcock D.F. Hille B. Neuron. 1996; 16: 219-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 17Sheu S.S. Sharma V.K. J. Physiol.

Biochem. 2004; 256-257: 209-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby precluding any effect on PS externalization. The ability of L-type Ca2+ channel blockers to inhibit thiol-induced PS externalization suggests that these channels play a role in transbilayer PS movements. It is unlikely that the inhibition was due to reduced activity of the ryanodine receptors that promote Ca2+ efflux from the ER (29Hofmann F. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 139: 33-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Moosmang S. Lenhardt P. Haider N. Hofmann F. Wegener J.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 106: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) since changes to bulk cytosolic Ca2+ levels following addition of NEM were similar in control and in verapamil-treated cells. 4These data, however, do not rule out possible differences in localized Ca2+ gradients at the interface of the cytoplasm and plasma membrane inner leaflet (where PS is localized). Moreover, inhibition could not be attributed to direct association between positively charged amphipathic compounds and membrane phospholipids since control experiments with chlorpromazine failed to result in inhibition of NEM-induced PS externalization. Furthermore, our conclusions are based on three structurally distinct (nifedipine, dihydropyridines; verapamil, phenylal-kyl amines; diltiazem, benzothiazepines) L-type channel blockers, all of which inhibited NEM-induced PS externalization to different degrees. The efficacy of inhibition might be related to differential partitioning of the various compounds into the plasma membrane bilayer (31Mason R.P. Campbell S.F. Wang S.D. Herbette L.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 634-640PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mason R.P. Moisey D.M. Shajenko L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar, 33Seelig A. Landwojtowicz E. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2000; 12: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABC1, promotes Ca2+-induced PS exposure at the cell surface (34Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). It is, however, unlikely that ABC1 is responsible for our observations since its activity is insensitive to Ca2+ channel blockers (35Hamon Y. Luciani M.F. Becq F. Verrier B. Rubartelli A. Chimini G. Blood. 1997; 90: 2911-2915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of other ABC transporter superfamily members, including P-glycoprotein and MRP (36Sarkadi B. Homolya L. Szakacs G. Varadi A. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1179-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), on the other hand, are inhibited by verapamil. These transporters, however, operate through Ca2+-independent mechanisms (37Dekkers D.W. Comfurius P. Schroit A.J. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14833-14837Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations argue in favor of a direct role for the L-type channel in PS externalization. Finally, we demonstrated that thiolation and cytosolic Ca2+ inhibit transport of PS from the outer to the inner leaflet and that thiolation significantly lowers the threshold for Ca2+ required to activate outward PS transport. This observation is significant because the concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ achieved under physiologic conditions are unlikely to reach the submillimolar concentrations needed to achieve complete scrambling of lipids across the bilayer. Indeed, the requirement for Ca2+ is significantly reduced by thiol inactivation. Thus, the data presented here support a model in which PS externalization is under the control of two distinct processes: (i) Ca2+- and/or thiol-dependent inactivation of the PS translocase that moves aminophospholipids from the outer to the inner membrane leaflet and (ii) Ca2+-dependent activation of outward transport through an L-type Ca2+ channel. The inactivation of the PS translocase by sulfhydryl reagents could be due to “masking” of protein sulfhydryls critical to PS transport. In principle, such a mechanism could be operative physiologically by regulated oxidation of specific protein sulfhydryls or by their conjugation with glutathione (38Thomas J.A. Mallis R.J. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The importance of Ca2+ in redox activation (39Yan Y. Wei C.L. Zhang W.R. Cheng H.P. Liu J. Acta Pharmacol.

https://openalex.org/W2086359322,"Insertion of magnesium into protoporphyrin IX by magnesium chelatase is a key step in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, which takes place in plant chloroplasts. ATP hydrolysis by the CHLI subunit of magnesium chelatase is an essential component of this reaction, and the activity of this enzyme is a primary determinant of the rate of magnesium insertion into the chlorophyll molecule (tetrapyrrole ring). Higher plant CHLI contains highly conserved cysteine residues and was recently identified as a candidate protein in a proteomic screen of thioredoxin target proteins (Balmer, Y., Koller, A., del Val, G., Manieri, W., Schurmann, P., and Buchanan, B. B. (2003) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.</i> 100, 370–375). To study the thioredoxin-dependent regulation of magnesium chelatase, we first investigated the effect of thioredoxin on the ATPase activity of CHLI1, a major isoform of CHLI in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. The ATPase activity of recombinant CHLI1 was found to be fully inactivated by oxidation and easily recovered by thioredoxin-assisted reduction, suggesting that CHLI1 is a target protein of thioredoxin. Moreover, we identified one crucial disulfide bond located in the C-terminal helical domain of CHLI1 protein, which may regulate the binding of the nucleotide to the N-terminal catalytic domain. The redox state of CHLI was also found to alter in a light-dependent manner <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, we successfully observed stimulation of the magnesium chelatase activity in isolated chloroplasts by reduction. Our findings strongly suggest that chlorophyll biosynthesis is subject to chloroplast biogenesis regulation networks to coordinate them with the photosynthetic pathways in chloroplasts."

Still, AtPLAI-deficient plants exhibited more damage than wild type plants after B. cinerea infection, and pretreatment of plants with methyl jasmonate alleviated pathogen damage to the mutant plants.

Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 215-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). One important defense response is the production of oxylipins, which include a variety of oxygenated fatty acid-derived compounds (4Blee E.

Great progress has been made in the understanding of oxylipin biosynthesis and its biological functions (4Blee E. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 315-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 5Howe G.A. Schilmiller A.L. Curr. Opin.

However, the initial step that makes linolenic acid available for JA biosynthesis is not well understood. Because it is a component of membrane lipids, attached via an ester linkage, linolenic acid is presumed to be released from complex lipids by a lipolytic activity, such as by phospholipase A (PLA), analogous to that in animal systems (4Blee E. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 315-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 5Howe G.A. Schilmiller A.L. Curr. Opin.

In Arabidopsis, a link between PLA1 and JA biosynthesis was reported, but the identified PLA1 is involved in anther dehiscence and pollen maturation, rather than in defense-induced JA formation in vegetative tissues (14Ishiguro S. Kawai-Oda A. Ueda J. Nishida I. Okada K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2191-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The discovery of arabidopsides and other complex plastidic lipids containing oxylipins has led to speculation that a lipoxygenase may act on intact plastidic membrane lipids and that intact oxylipin-containing polar complex lipids may be the substrate for a hydrolytic enzyme (15Stelmach B.A. Müller A. Hennig P. Gebhardt S. Schubert-Zsilavecz M. Weiler E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (Correction (2001) J. Biol.

In any case, studies using different plant systems have implicated a role of PLA-like activity in mediating defense responses. Early studies showed that free fatty acids and lysophosphatidylcholine could modulate 1,3-β-glucanase activity and callose deposition in suspension-cultured soybean cells (18Kauss H. Jeblick W. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 7-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The production of free fatty acids and lysophospholipids is induced in various elicitations, such as cell wall extracts from fungus Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae on tobacco cells, hairpin, and fungal Verticillium dahliae extracts on suspension-cultured soybean cells, oligosaccharide elicitors on tomato leaves, fungal elicitors on cultured cells of California poppy, by wounding, and by systemin (19Roy S.

Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1510-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the gene and biochemical identities of the lipolytic enzymes involved in JA production in defense response are not defined. In mammalian cells, intracellular PLA2 plays a critical role in the release of arachidonic acid for the synthesis of eicosanoid oxylipins (25Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Intracellular PLA2 consists of two major types: Ca2+-dependent PLA2 (cPLA2) and Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2). In comparison, Arabidopsis has no homolog to cPLA2, but plant patatins share sequence similarities with the catalytic region of iPLA2 (27Rydel T.J. Williams J.M. Krieger E. Moshiri F. Stallings W.C. Brown S.M. Pershing J.C. Purcell J.P. Alibhai M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6696-6708Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The term patatins refers to a group of closely related vacuolar storage proteins in potato tubers; these proteins possess nonspecific acyl hydrolase activity, releasing fatty acid groups from several types of lipids, including phospholipids and galactolipids (28Andrews D.L. Beames B. Summers M.D. Park W.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Patatin-like proteins are present in other plant species and have been implicated in defense responses. For example, the expression of patatin-like genes was induced in tobacco cells infected with tobacco mosaic virus, bacterium Erwinia carotovora, fungus B. cinerea, or treated with a cell death-inducing protein elicitor, β-megaspermin (29Dhondt S. Geoffroy P. Stelmach B.A. Legrand M. Heitz T. Plant J. 2000; 23: 431-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dhondt S. Gouzerh G. Muller A. Legrand M. Heitz T. Plant J. 2002; 32: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, acyl hydrolyzing activity increased before cell death and before the accumulation of 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) and JA, suggesting that patatin-like proteins mediate the production of JA and defense responses in tobacco (29Dhondt S. Geoffroy P. Stelmach B.A. Legrand M. Heitz T. Plant J. 2000; 23: 431-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dhondt S. Gouzerh G. Muller A. Legrand M. Heitz T. Plant J. 2002; 32: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, the expression of the patatin-like gene At2g26560 (AtPLAIIA) was shown to be induced in response to various abiotic and biotic stresses (31Narusaka Y. Narusaka M. Seki M. Fujita M. Ishida J. Nakashima M. Enju A. Sakurai T. Satou M. Kamiya A. Park P. Kobayashi M. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, suppression of the gene increased plant susceptibility to pathogen, implying that the patatin-like activity may facilitate, rather than suppress, pathogen infection (32La Camera S. Geoffroy P. Samaha H. Ndiaye A. Rahim G. Legrand M. Heitz T. Plant J. 2005; 44: 810-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis has nine genes with sequences closely related to patatin (32La Camera S. Geoffroy P. Samaha H. Ndiaye A. Rahim G. Legrand M. Heitz T. Plant J. 2005; 44: 810-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Holk A. Rietz S. Zahn M. Quader H. Scherer G.F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). But there has been no direct evidence for a positive role for patatin-like enzymes in the production of JA and in plant response to pathogens. Another gene in Arabidopsis, designated AtPLAI (At1g61850) (33Holk A. Rietz S. Zahn M. Quader H. Scherer G.F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), encodes a protein with a patatin catalytic domain, but an overall sequence more similar to mammalian iPLA2 than to other Arabidopsis patatin-like proteins. Whereas the other nine patatin-like genes encode proteins with 382 to 526 amino acid residues, AtPLAI encodes a protein about 800 amino acid residues larger than those patatins. In addition, it contains multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRR) at its N terminus. These distinctive features raise intriguing questions about the enzymatic identity and cellular functions of AtPLAI. Here, we show that AtPLAI is an acyl hydrolase that uses both phospholipids and galactolipids as substrates, that it is involved in basal jasmonic acid production, and that it promotes Arabidopsis resistance to the necrotrophic fungus B. cinerea. Plant Materials—Arabidopsis thaliana plants (ecotype Wassilewskija) were grown in growth chambers under a day/night regimen of 23/18 °C and 10/14-h photoperiod under white light of 150 μmol m–2 s–1. The T-DNA insertion mutants at gene AtPLAI (patatin-like acyl hydrolase 1) at the locus At1g61850 were isolated by screening T-DNA insertion lines according to the protocol of the Arabidopsis Gene Knock-out Research Facility at the University of Wisconsin (34Sussman M.R. Amasino R.M. Young J.C. Krysan P.J. Austin-Phillips S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1465-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The two mutants (AtplaI-1 and AtplaI-2) have T-DNA inserted at the 2nd exon and the 16th exon of the gene, respectively. The sites of T-DNA insertion were confirmed by sequencing, and the homozygous plants were used in the study. Genetic Complementation of Mutant Plants—A 7.8-kb genomic fragment of DNA containing the coding region of AtPLAI (At1g61850) and 1.42 kb 5′- and 0.55 kb 3′-untranslated regions was amplified by PCR. The PCR product was cloned into the AscI site of the pEC291 binary vector. The resulting vector was introduced into the C58C1 strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and the AtplaI-1 mutant plants were transformed as described (35Clough S.J. Bent A. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The measurement of JA in the complemented plants and the pathogen test with B. cinerea were performed as described below. Treatment of Plants with Pathogen, JA, and Salicylic Acid (SA)—Fungus strain B. cinerea was used for inoculation of 5-week-old soil-grown plants. Fungal spores were prepared and quantified as described (36Broekaert W.F. Terras F.R. Cammue B.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 69: 55-60Crossref Google Scholar). For inoculation, each leaf was pricked 3 times using a 23-gauge needle, and each wound was covered immediately with a 10-μl drop of a suspension of 105 conidial spores/ml in potato dextrose broth medium. Inoculated plants were incubated at 18 °C under dim light at 100% relative humidity in propagator flats covered with a clear polystyrene lid for the time periods indicated. For chemical treatments, 5-week-old soil-grown plants were sprayed with a solution of 0.01% ethanol and 0.1% Triton X-100 in water containing either 0.5 mm salicylic acid (pH 6.5) or 50 μm methyl jasmonate (pH 6.8) 48 h prior to inoculation with B. cinerea. Control plants were sprayed with a solution containing only 0.01% ethanol and 0.1% Triton X-100. cDNA Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Protein in Escherichia coli—The cDNA library CD4-16 was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) in Ohio State University. The full-length cDNA of the AtPLAI gene was obtained with PCR using the cDNA library as a template and primers of forward 5′-CGCGTCGACTGATGTCTTCTACATGTTC-3′ and reverse 5′-CTTGCGGCCGCGTCTTTCTATACATTAGG-3′. The cDNA was cloned into a pGEMT-vector (Promega) and both strands were sequenced. The coding sequence of AtPLAI (3798 bp) was amplified with PCR and cloned into the SmaI and SalI sites of the pGEM-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) after the glutathione S-transferase (GST) coding sequence. The sequence of the GST fusion construct was verified before it was introduced into E. coli strain BL-21(DE3). The cells were grown to an A600 of 0.7 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12 h at 22 °C. The purification of the GST fusion protein was performed as described previously (37Pappan K. Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47833-47839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the protein concentration was determined with the Bradford method (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Enzyme Activity Assay Using Phospholipid Substrates—Lipids fluorescently labeled at the sn-2 position, 1-palmitoyl-2-[12-(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl-amino)dodecanoyl]-phospholipids (NBD-lipids), including NBD-phosphatidylcholine (PC), NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), NBD-phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and NBD-phosphatidic acid (PA) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). To prepare the lipid substrate, NBD-lipids in chloroform were dried under a nitrogen stream and emulsified in distilled water containing 0.05% Triton X-100 by sonication. Acyl hydrolyzing activities were assayed in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100. Sixty μm NBD-lipids were used as substrate and 10 μg of purified protein was added to the mixture in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and was then stopped by adding 700 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 200 μl of 2 m KCl. After vortexing and separation by centrifugation, chloroform was evaporated from the organic phase under a nitrogen stream; the lipid was dissolved in chloroform and spotted on a TLC plate (Silica Gel 60, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The TLC plate was developed in chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide/water (65:39:4:4, v/v/v/v). Lipids on the plate were visualized under ultraviolet light. The spots corresponding to free fatty acids and lysophospholipids were scraped into vials. The lipid in the vials was extracted with methanol and their fluorescence was measured at 460 nm (excitation) and 534 nm (emission). For activity assays using radioactive phosphatidylinositol (PI) as a substrate, 0.6 μCi of 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl-1-[arachidonyl-14C]PI (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 3 μmol of unlabeled soy PI (Sigma) were mixed in chloroform, the solvent was evaporated under a nitrogen stream, and the lipid was emulsified in 0.5 ml of H2O containing 0.05% Triton X-100 by sonication. The enzyme assay was performed as described above, using 20 μl of the radioactive substrate. After separation on a TLC plate, the lipids on the plate were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor. The spots corresponding to the lipid standards were scraped into vials, and their radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Galactolipid Preparation and Enzyme Assays—Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) were purified from Arabidopsis leaves. Lipid was extracted from young Arabidopsis leaves and separated as described (39Zien C.A. Wang C. Wang X. Welti R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For enzyme assays, the solvent of the lipid extract was evaporated under a nitrogen stream, and MGDG or DGDG was emulsified in water containing 0.05% Triton X-100 by sonication. The enzyme assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 100 μm galactolipid substrates, and 10 μg of enzyme protein in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and then stopped by adding 700 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 200 μl of 2 m KCl. Lipids from the chloroform phase were separated by TLC in chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide/water (65:39:4:4, v/v/v/v). Lipid spots were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor. Free fatty acid spots were scraped and methylated by adding 1.5 ml of 1.5% sulfuric acid in methanol containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene and triheptadecanoin (C17:0) as an internal standard and heating at 90 °C for 60 min. Methylated fatty acids were extracted by successively adding 1.0 ml of H2O and 1.0 ml of hexane. Fatty acid methyl esters were quantified using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph with flame ionization detection and an HPINNOWax column (30 m length × 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness; Agilent). Also, the non-enzymatic product formation was subtracted from the enzyme-produced products. Preparation of Oxylipin-rich Total Lipid from Wounded Plants and Enzyme Assay—Leaves of 4-week-old plants were wounded mechanically with a forceps and total lipids were extracted 45 min after wounding as described (39Zien C.A. Wang C. Wang X. Welti R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The lipids were emulsified in distilled water containing 0.05% Triton X-100 by sonication and used as a substrate. 30 μg of the lipids (1 μg/μl) and 5 μg of purified AtPLAI were added to each reaction in a final volume of 200 μl. The other assay conditions for acyl hydrolyzing activities were as described above. Control reactions contained the same amount of lipids and empty vector bacterial proteins and were subjected to the same purification process as those reactions containing AtPLAI. After the reaction the lipids were extracted and the organic phase was analyzed by the mass spectrometry. Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNA was isolated from liquid nitrogen-frozen plant leaves using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide extraction method as described previously (40Fan L. Zheng S. Wang X. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2183-2196PubMed Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) containing a blend of oligo(dT) and random hexamer primers. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed on 50 ng of cDNA with the iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Amplification of the Arabidopsis polyubiquitin gene (UBQ10) transcripts derived from gene At4g05320 were used as reference. The gene specific primer pairs used for the PCR are (from 5′ to 3′): AtPLAI (At1g61850): forward, ACACCGACAAGTGAC TGGGAAGATAG, reverse, GTACCTGAGCTTTCGATGAGAGGCAA; lipoxygenase2 (LOX2, At3g45140): forward, AGAGCTGGAGCTGGTGTTGTTAAG, reverse, GAACACCCATTCCGGTAACACCAT; lipoxygenase 3 (LOX3, At1g17420): forward, TATGGATTTGCGGCAGAGATCGGA, reverse, AGGCTCAGAACTCGGAACCAACAA; allene oxide synthase (AOS, At5g42650): forward, TGGTGGCGAGGTTGTTTGTGATTG, reverse ATTAACGGAGCTTCCTAACGGCGA; allene oxide cyclase 1 (AOC1, At3g25760): forward, CTTAAGCCCAGTGGAGTTGTAAGC, reverse, TATACAGGACACGAGAAAGATAAGACT; allene oxide cyclase 2 (AOC2, At3g25780): forward, GCACTGGAG7CCTAGCGGAGTTATAAGT, reverse, TATATCATTACACAGCGATACGAGAAAC; hydroperoxide lyase (HPL, At4g15440): forward, CGTCGAACAAACAGTGTGCAGCTA, reverse, TAAATCGGCAACGAGCAAGGAAGC; 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) reductase (OPR3, At2g06050): forward, CGGATTTGGTTTCGCGGTTCAAGA, reverse, TCCGTGTAGCCAACAACTGGATCT; jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (MJT, At1g19640): forward, TATGTAAGCTCGCCACGATACGCT, reverse, AACACGATCAACCGGCTCTAACGA; PR1 (At2g14610): forward, CGTGGGAATTATGTGAACGAGAAGCC, reverse, CACGTCCTTTATGTACGTGTGTATGC; polyubiquitin (UBQ10, At4g05320): forward, CACACTCCACTTGGTCTTGCGT, reverse, TGGTCTTTCCGGTGAGAGTCTTCA. PCR amplification was performed with a MyiQ™ Single Color Real Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of JA and Free Linolenic Acid—Approximately 50–100 mg of fresh Arabidopsis tissues were sealed in 1.5 ml of snap-cap vials. After being frozen in liquid nitrogen, the leaves were ground to powder, and 500 μl of 1-propanol/H2O/concentrated HCl (2:1:0.002, v/v/v) with internal standards was added, followed by agitation for 30 min at 4 °C. Dichloromethane (1 ml) was added, followed by agitation for another 30 min and then centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 min. The bottom layer was used for JA and linolenic acid analysis. Dihydrojasmonic acid (H2JA) and heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) were used as internal standards for JA and linolenic acid quantification, respectively. Plant extracts were first separated by high performance liquid chromatography, equipped with a reversed-phase column (C18 Gemini 5μ, 150 × 2.00 mm, Phenomenex, CA), using a binary solvent system composed of water with 0.1% formic acid and methanol with 0.1% formic acid as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and a gradient of linearly increasing methanol content from 30 to 100% at 30 min. A hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer (ABI 4000 Q-Trap, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) outfitted with an electrospray ion source, was used in multiple reaction monitoring mode. JA, H2JA, linolenic acid, and C17:0 eluted at 12.44, 13.74, 20.7, and 22.01 min, respectively. JA, linolenic acid, H2JA, and C17:0 can easily lose one proton from the carboxylic group and become negatively charged precursors, so they were analyzed in negative scan mode. An appropriate precursor-to-product ion transition that represents a major fragmentation path and is unique for each phytohormone was identified, and MS/MS conditions, including collision energy, collision cell exit potential, declustering potential, and entrance potential were optimized to produce maximal signal. The unique precursor ions and product ions were identified using authentic compounds. Precursor ions ([M-H]–) of JA, linolenic acid, H2JA, and C17:0 are m/z 209, 277, 211, and 269, respectively, which were monitored by Q1. After collision-induced dissociation in Q2 under the optimized conditions, the precursor ions of JA, linolenic acid, H2JA, and C17:0 (m/z ratio of 209, 277, 211, and 269) give rise to a major fragmentation ion of m/z 59, 259, 59, and 251 for JA, linolenic acid, H2JA, and C17:0 in the MS/MS spectra of authentic compounds. Therefore, the diagnostic product ions m/z ratios of 59, 259, 59, and 251 were selected to be monitored by Q3, and the precursor-to-product ion transitions of 209 → 59, 277 → 259, 211 → 59, and 269 → 251 are used to quantify JA and linolenic acid. The peak area of the main diagnostic product ion was used for quantification. Lipid Profiling—The processes of lipid extraction, lipid analysis, and lipid quantification were performed as described (41Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.-E. Rajashekar C.B.

Briefly, after inoculation of B. cinerea, leaf samples were harvested for lipid analysis at the indicated time intervals. Lipid samples were analyzed on an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (API 4000, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The molecular species of phospholipids and galactolipids were quantified in comparison to the two internal standards using a correction curve determined between standards (41Welti R. Li W. Li M.

https://openalex.org/W2145134132,"The traditional view that immunoglobulin is produced only by differentiated B lymphocytes has been challenged as immunoglobulin genes have been found to be expressed in nonhematopoietic human cancer cells. However, this phenomenon has not been widely accepted, and knowledge about this newly discovered concept is limited. In this study, we investigated the IgG1 heavy chain (IGHG1) constant region gene and IgG protein expression in 6 cell lines, including epithelial cancer cells, and in tissues from 66 hyperplasias, adenomas, and carcinomas. We also studied the mechanism of IgG production in these cells by examining the expression of RAG1 (recombination activating gene 1), RAG2, and AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase). In cancer cell lines, mRNA of the IGHG1 constant region and Igamma-Cgamma sterile transcript were detected by nested RT-PCR, and Ig gamma and Ig kappa proteins were detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot. In surgically resected carcinoma tissues, we detected mRNA of the IGHG1 constant region by in situ hybridization, and by laser microdissection-assisted nested RT-PCR. Ig gamma and Ig kappa proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry. The V(D)J recombination of IgH and IgL loci, the Sgamma1/2-Smu switch circle, and the expression of RAG1 and RAG2 were also found in these cancer cell lines. These data suggest that cancer cells are capable of producing IgG. Because of its potential biological and clinical significance, this phenomenon warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2162973968,"Vasoconstriction and vascular medial hypertrophy, resulting from increased intracellular [Ca2+] in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC), contribute to elevated vascular resistance in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Caveolae, microdomains within the plasma membrane, contain the protein caveolin, which binds certain signaling molecules. We tested the hypothesis that PASMC from IPAH patients express more caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and caveolae, which contribute to increased capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) and DNA synthesis. Immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of Cav-1 in smooth muscle cells but not endothelial cells of pulmonary arteries from patients with IPAH. Subcellular fractionation and electron microscopy confirmed the increase in Cav-1 and caveolae expression in IPAH-PASMC. Treatment of IPAH-PASMC with agents that deplete membrane cholesterol (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or lovastatin) disrupted caveolae, attenuated CCE, and inhibited DNA synthesis of IPAH-PASMC. Increasing Cav-1 expression of normal PASMC with a Cav-1-encoding adenovirus increased caveolae formation, CCE, and DNA synthesis; treatment of IPAH-PASMC with siRNA targeted to Cav-1 produced the opposite effects. Treatments that down-regulate caveolin/caveolae expression, including cholesterol-lowering drugs, reversed the increased CCE and DNA synthesis in IPAH-PASMC. Increased caveolin and caveolae expression thus contribute to IPAH-PASMC pathophysiology. The close relationship between caveolin/caveolae expression and altered cell physiology in IPAH contrast with previous results obtained in various animal models, including caveolin-knockout mice, thus emphasizing unique features of the human disease. The results imply that disruption of caveolae in PASMC may provide a novel therapeutic approach to attenuate disease manifestations of IPAH."

Production of oligomers of other amyloidogenic proteins has been reported to precede fibril formation, suggesting oligomers as intermediates in fibrillogenesis. A variant of cystatin C, with a Leu68→ Gln substitution, is highly amyloidogenic, and carriers of this mutation suffer from massive cerebral amyloidosis leading to brain hemorrhage and death in early adulthood. This work describes doughnut-shaped oligomers formed by wild type and L68Q cystatin C upon incubation of the monomeric proteins. Purified oligomers of cystatin C are shown to fibrillize faster and at a lower concentration than the monomeric protein, indicating a role of the oligomers as fibril-assembly intermediates. Moreover, the present work demonstrates that three-dimensional domain swapping is involved in the formation of the oligomers, because variants of monomeric cystatin C, stabilized against three-dimensional domain swapping by engineered disulfide bonds, do not produce oligomers upon incubation under non-reducing conditions. Redox experiments using wild type and stabilized cystatin C strongly suggest that the oligomers, and thus probably the fibrils as well, are formed by propagated domain swapping rather than by assembly of domain-swapped cystatin C dimers.

Insoluble amyloid fibrils are found as deposits in patients with a range of diseases, e.g. Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, reactive amyloidosis, cystatin C amyloidosis, and the prionoses (1Yamada M.

Knowledge of the molecular mechanism causing the transition of physiologically normal and soluble proteins to toxic oligomers and insoluble fibrils is essential for the development of treatment strategies for this group of common, but currently incurable, diseases. Production of oligomers of different amyloidogenic proteins has been reported to precede the fibril formation stage, suggesting oligomers as intermediates in fibrillogenesis (4Lashuel H.A.

Human cystatin C is involved in in vivo fibrillogenesis as the commonly occurring normal variant (wild type (wt) 3The abbreviations used are: wt, wild type; Aβ, amyloid β peptide; CD, circular dichroism; DTT, dithiothreitol; HCCAA, hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy; ThT, thioflavin T. 3The abbreviations used are: wt, wild type; Aβ, amyloid β peptide; CD, circular dichroism; DTT, dithiothreitol; HCCAA, hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy; ThT, thioflavin T. cystatin C) and as a more rare but extremely amyloidogenic L68Q cystatin C variant. Patients suffering from Hereditary Cystatin C Amyloid Angiopathy (HCCAA) have L68Q cystatin C deposited as amyloid fibrils in the cerebral arteries, resulting in cerebral hemorrhage and death in early adulthood (7Olafsson I. Grubb A. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Investig. 2000; 7: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of HCCAA patients, high concentrations of non-physiological cystatin C dimers are detected (8Bjarnadottir M. Nilsson C. Lindström V. Westman A. Davidsson P. Thormodsson F. Blondal H. Gudmundsson G. Grubb A. Amyloid: J. Protein Folding Disord. 2001; 8: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, wt cystatin C participates in the formation of amyloid deposits together with the Aβ peptide (1Yamada M. Neuropathology. 2000; 20: 8-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 2Grubb A.O. Adv. Clin. Chem. 2000; 35: 63-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has been observed particularly in elderly individuals and in patients suffering from Alzheimer disease or Down syndrome. Cystatin C belongs to the cystatin superfamily of reversible inhibitors of cysteine proteases of the papain and legumain families (2Grubb A.O. Adv. Clin. Chem. 2000; 35: 63-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This low molecular mass protein (13,343 Da), expressed in all nucleated human cells, is composed of one polypeptide chain of 120 amino acid residues with two disulfide bonds in its C-terminal part. The general fold of monomeric inhibitors of the cystatin superfamily has been defined by the crystal structure of chicken cystatin (9Bode W. Engh R. Musil D. Thiele U. Huber R. Karshikov A. Brzin J. Kos J. Turk V. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). It consists of a long α-helix running across a grip of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 1A). Several crystal structures of wt cystatin C have been reported so far, but in all of them the protein exists in the form of symmetric three-dimensional domain-swapped dimers (Fig. 1B) (10Janowski R.

In these dimers, tertiary structure elements of the monomeric fold are exchanged between the two participating monomers. The mechanism of three-dimensional domain swapping requires partial unfolding, in which the exchanged domains separate in order to recombine in the oligomeric context. From the time of its definition in diphteria toxin (14Bennett M.J. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), three-dimensional domain swapping has been observed in more than 30 different proteins, among them in such amyloidogenic proteins as prions (15Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and β2-microglobulin (16Eakin C.M. Attenello F.J.

Although both monomeric wt and L68Q cystatin C are known to produce dimers and amyloid fibrils in vitro, no high order oligomeric forms of these proteins have been described. However, such oligomers have been observed for other amyloidogenic proteins, such as Aβ (4Lashuel H.A. Hartley D.M. Petre B.M. Wall J.S. Simon M.N. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Mol.

Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The mechanism behind the formation of these oligomers is not well established. Although oligomers have been suggested as productive intermediates in fibrillogenesis, off-pathway oligomers of prion proteins have also been reported (20Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The oligomers themselves are probably of pathophysiological significance, because they may be substantially more toxic than the mature amyloid fibrils (19Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A.

It has been suggested that the process of three-dimensional domain swapping, when propagated in an open-ended fashion, could be the basis of the formation of amyloid fibrils (22Jaskolski M.

We have earlier reported on stabilized variants of monomeric wt and L68Q cystatin C, with cysteine mutations introduced for selective formation of disulfide bridges between the tertiary structure elements that undergo separation on domain swapping (Fig. 1C) (28Nilsson M. Wang X. Rodziewicz-Motowidlo S. Janowski R. Lindström V. Önnerfjord P. Westermark G. Grzonka Z. Jaskolski M. Grubb A. J. Biol.

The stabilized variants were found to have a drastically decreased capability to form dimers and fibrils. Although demonstrating the importance of three-dimensional domain swapping in the generation of dimers and fibrils, these observations were not able to determine whether the domain swapping occurred in a propagated way or was limited to the formation of closed-ended dimers. To further elucidate the molecular pathophysiological mechanism of the transformation of monomeric wt and L68Q cystatin C into amyloid fibrils, the present work aimed at identifying and characterizing any possible oligomeric intermediates. Indeed, such oligomers could be identified and purified. It was also possible to demonstrate that these oligomers are intermediates in fibrillogenesis, and not off-pathway products. Furthermore, our data clearly indicate that propagated three-dimensional domain swapping is pivotal in oligomer formation. Q-Sepharose and Superdex HR75 were from Amersham Biosciences.

Protein Expression and Purification—The different cystatin C variants were expressed and purified as previously described (28Nilsson M. Wang X. Rodziewicz-Motowidlo S. Janowski R. Lindström V.

Briefly, wt cystatin C was expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated from periplasmic extracts by a two-step procedure (29Abrahamson M. Dalbøge H. Olafsson I. Carlsen S. Grubb A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A similar procedure was used for the expression of two cystatin C variants, wt cystatin C stab1 (Fig. 1C) and wt cystatin C stab2, stabilized against three-dimensional domain swapping by inserted disulfide bonds (28Nilsson M. Wang X. Rodziewicz-Motowidlo S. Janowski R. Lindström V. Önnerfjord P. Westermark G. Grzonka Z. Jaskolski M. Grubb A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24236-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified by anion exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose in 20 mm ethanolamine, pH 9.0, containing 1 mm benzamidinium chloride. After concentration, the samples were subjected to gel chromatography using Amersham Biosciences FPLC Superdex HR75 column and 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The proteins were lyophilized and stored at room temperature. In the case of L68Q cystatin C, the protein was purified from inclusion bodies by dissolving them in 6 m guanidinium chloride, followed by refolding of the protein on a Superdex HR75 column in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (31Gerhartz B. Ekiel I. Abrahamson M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17309-17317Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After gel chromatography, L68Q cystatin C was lyophilized and stored at room temperature. Determination of Protein Concentration—The protein concentration of the solutions of monomeric cystatin C was determined by UV absorption spectroscopy at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of ϵ = 11,100 m–1 cm–1 (A280,0.1% = 0.83) (32Lindahl P. Abrahamson M. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The concentration of oligomeric species was measured using Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) and a DPC Millenia spectrophotometer. Formation of Oligomers and Amyloid Fibrils—Wild type cystatin C and its two variants, stabilized against three-dimensional domain swapping (28Nilsson M. Wang X. Rodziewicz-Motowidlo S. Janowski R. Lindström V. Önnerfjord P. Westermark G. Grzonka Z. Jaskolski M. Grubb A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24236-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), were incubated at a concentration of 3 mg/ml in 50 mm NaAc, 100 mm NaCl, pH 4.0, at 48 °C with continuous agitation. The same incubation conditions were used for L68Q cystatin C, except that a lower protein concentration of 0.6 mg/ml was used. Oligomerization of stabilized monomeric cystatin C variants was induced by addition of DTT to a final concentration of 3.5 mm, corresponding to a 2–3-fold molar excess over the cysteine content of the proteins, followed by 1 h of incubation at 48 °C with continuous agitation, after which the mixtures were extensively dialyzed in jars open to the ambient atmosphere. Purification of Oligomers—Oligomers were purified by repeated pressure ultrafiltration using microconcentrators with a cut-off of 100 kDa. A sample with unpurified oligomers was inserted into a rinsed microconcentrator cell and centrifuged at 9800 rpm. The oligomers retained in the cell were diluted with 50 mm NaAc, 100 mm NaCl, pH 4.0, and ultrafiltered again. The dilution-ultrafiltration cycle was repeated three times. Finally, the volume of the retentate with the oligomers was adjusted with buffer and the solution was transferred to an Eppendorf tube by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min. All centrifugation steps were carried out at 4 °C. Seeding—Seeds were prepared using a water bath-type ultrasonic transmitter to sonicate preformed mature fibrils of wt and L68Q cystatin C for two times, 30 min. Aliquots of the suspensions of seeds were added to the starting solution containing 3 mg/ml of monomeric wt cystatin C in 50 mm NaAc, 100 mm NaCl, pH 4.0. When the seeding capacity of oligomers was tested, oligomers were purified as described above and added to the starting solution. Electron Microscopy—Protein samples (5 μl) were applied on a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid (400 mesh). After 1 min of adsorption, excess liquid was removed using filter paper, and the samples were negatively stained with 2% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 s. The samples were examined with a Philips CM10 electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), operating at an excitation voltage of 60 or 100 kV. Electron micrographs were analyzed using the software Image J (33Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophot. Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). Quantitative Estimation of Amyloid Fibrils—The formation of amyloid fibrils was estimated by the thioflavine T (ThT) fluorescence assay as described by LeVine (34LeVine 3rd., H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar, 35LeVine 3rd, H. Scholten J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Aliquots were removed from the sample at timed intervals and analyzed. Protein samples were diluted with 50 mm glycine-sodium hydroxide buffer, pH 8.5, containing 100 μm ThT. Immediately after dilution, measurements were carried out in black polystyrene 96 well microtiter plates (Nunc F96 MicroWell Plates, Roskilde, Denmark), pretreated with Sigmacote (Sigma). The fluorescence was recorded using a FLUOstar OPTIMA fluorimeter at excitation and emission wavelengths of 450 and 490 nm, respectively. When the fibrillization capacity of purified oligomers was tested, the change in fluorescence intensity for the incubated samples was calculated with reference to the fluorescence intensity of the starting material. The significance of fluorescence intensity differences was tested by the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. Electrophoresis—Oligomers were visualized by two SDS-PAGE systems, using pre-cast NuPage Novex Bis-Tris gradient gels (4–12%) and NuPage Novex Tris-acetate gradient gels (3–8%). The Bis-Tris gels were run with the morpholinoethansulfonate buffer system, pH 6.4, at 200 V for 35 min. The samples were applied with a loading buffer containing a final concentration of 10% (w/v) glycerol, 141 mm Tris base, 106 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.51 mm EDTA, and 0.075% (w/v) ServaBlue. The Tris-acetate polyacrylamide gels were run in a buffer of 1.1% (w/v) β-alanine, 1% (v/v) HAc, 0.1% (w/v) SDS and with use of a loading buffer of 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1.1% (w/v) β-alanine, 1% (v/v) HAc, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 0.075% (w/v) ServaBlue. The Tris-acetate gels were run at 150 V for 1 h. The gels were silver-stained as described by the manufacturer. Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—Fibrils and purified oligomers of wt cystatin C were prepared in 50 mm NaAc, 100 mm NaCl, pH 4.0. Lyophilized monomeric wt cystatin C was dissolved in 10 mm NaAc, pH 4.0. Prior to use, the stock solution of each form of cystatin C was diluted in 10 mm NaAc, pH 4.0, to a final maximal concentration of ∼0.2 mg/ml. 200 μl of the various protein solutions were placed in a cuvette with 1-mm path length, and CD spectra were collected on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C. A CD spectrum of the buffer was subtracted from each sample spectrum for background correction. Spectra were recorded using a step size of 1 nm and a bandwidth of 0.4 nm. Ten consecutive scans were recorded for all spectra on average. The stock solution of each form of cystatin C was serially diluted, and scans were recorded for each dilution until no signal attributed to the protein could be obtained. Immunoblotting—Dot-blotting using nitrocellulose membranes and polyclonal rabbit anti-cystatin C and anti-oligomer A11 antibodies was performed as described by the manufacturer of the anti-oligomeric antibodies, BIOSOURCE. Briefly, 1–3 μl of the protein samples was applied on a nitrocellulose membrane and air-dried. The membrane was then blocked by the use of a solution of 10% (w/v) milk proteins, washed, and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h. After further washing, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody for 45 min and developed using the EZ-ECL chemiluminescence detection kit as described by the manufacturer. In Vitro Fibril Formation of wt and L68Q Cystatin C and wt Cystatin C Stabilized against Domain Swapping—We have previously shown that recombinant wt cystatin C forms amyloid fibrils in vitro in solutions at pH 2.0 (28Nilsson M. Wang X. Rodziewicz-Motowidlo S. Janowski R. Lindström V. Önnerfjord P. Westermark G. Grzonka Z. Jaskolski M. Grubb A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24236-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To produce fibrils under more physiological conditions and at a slower rate allowing detection of possible oligomers, we have selected a concentration of 3 mg/ml of wt cystatin C and incubation with continuous agitation at 48 °C in 50 mm NaAc, 100 mm NaCl, pH 4.0. An exponential increase in the ThT fluorescence intensity, indicating the formation of fibrils, was observed after 3 weeks of incubation (Fig. 2A). Electron micrographs at this stage showed long, non-branched, twisted fibrillar structures (Fig. 2B). The diameter of the mature fibrils of wt cystatin C was 10.4 ± 2.2 nm (mean ± S.D.; n = 200). The propensity of L68Q cystatin C to form fibrils in vitro has not been tested so far due to difficulties in producing sufficient amounts of recombinant L68Q cystatin C. In the present investigation, we used a protein concentration of 0.6 rather than 3 mg/ml in the incubation mixture. L68Q cystatin C was observed to form fibrils even at this reduced protein concentration and with a lag phase of less than 3 days (Fig. 2A). The L68Q cystatin C fibrils were similar in appearance to those of wt cystatin C, but showed a higher tendency for lateral attachment (Fig. 2C). The diameter of the L68Q cystatin C fibrils was 11.1 ± 2.3 nm (n = 148). Incubation at a concentration of 3 mg/ml of a variant of wt cystatin C (wt cystatin C stab1), stabilized against three-dimensional domain swapping, did not result in any fibril formation during the entire incubation period of 38 days (Fig. 2A). In Vitro Oligomer Formation of wt and L68Q Cystatin C—To detect any possible intermediates preceding the formation of amyloid fibrils, we closely examined the incubated samples during the lag phase, when no fibrils are present in the solution, as estimated by the ThT fluorescence assay. Most studies employed wt cystatin C incubated at a concentration of 3 mg/ml. During the lag phase, starting already at 1 h of incubation, electron microscopy demonstrated doughnut-shaped objects with a central hole (Fig. 3, A and B). No fibrils could be detected by electron microscopy until the exponential phase of the increase in ThT fluorescence. The oligomer populations were rather homogenous, with a Gaussian size distribution. The mean outer diameter was 13.4 ± 1.9 nm (n = 916) and the mean inner diameter was 2.7 ± 0.7 nm (n = 176). The mean width of the ring was 5.4 ± 0.9 nm (n = 192). Incubation of L68Q cystatin C at 0.6 mg/ml also produced doughnut-shaped oligomers with virtually identical appearance in electron microscopy (Fig. 3C). The oligomers were also analyzed using two different SDS-PAGE systems. Both systems detected oligomers of wt cystatin C already after 1 h of incubation. The oligomers could be observed as a smear corresponding to a molecular mass of 200–300 kDa (data not shown). Purification of Cystatin C Oligomers—Despite many attempts, we failed to purify the oligomers by size exclusion chromatography. However, repeated pressure ultrafiltration using filter cells with a cut-off of 100 kDa allowed a virtually complete separation of the oligomers from the monomeric species as assessed by SDS-PAGE. The retentate, containing the oligomers, was diluted and ultrafiltered three times using 100 μl of buffer each time. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, the last filtrate did not contain any detectable amount of protein, whereas the oligomers are present in the retentate. These observations were corroborated by electron microscopy, showing doughnut-shaped objects in the retentate, but not in the filtrate. The purified oligomers had the same appearance as those in the original solution (Figs. 3, A and B and 4B). Cystatin C Oligomers Do Not Show Any Seeding Effect—Seeding a solution of an amyloidogenic protein with sonicated preformed amyloid fibrils reduces the lag phase for fibril formation significantly, possibly by the elimination of a nucleation step (36Ohnishi S. Takano K. Cell Mol. Life. Sci. 2004; 61: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Indeed, when sonicated preformed fibrils of either wt or L68Q cystatin C were added to the monomeric starting solution, the lag phase of wt cystatin C fibrillization was reduced by more than 2 weeks, even at very low concentrations of added sonicated fibrils. In contrast, addition of different concentrations of purified oligomers of wt cystatin C up to ∼2% of the starting cystatin C concentration, did not significantly shorten the lag phase. The Structure of Cystatin C Oligomers Is Related to That of Oligomers of Other Amyloidogenic Proteins—Using polyclonal antibodies raised against Aβ oligomers, Kayed et al. (37Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3381) Google Scholar) have found that soluble oligomers of several different proteins display a common structure regardless of the amino acid sequences of the proteins. We used the anti-Aβ oligomer antibody A11 and found that it reacts with wt cystatin C oligomers, but not with monomeric cystatin C used as starting material for the production of oligomers (Fig. 5). Domain Swapping Is a Prerequisite for Oligomerization and Fibrillization—The crystal structure of dimeric wt cystatin C demonstrates that the dimer is formed via three-dimensional swapping of domains between the two participating monomers (10Janowski R.

Proteins. 2005; 61: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have earlier reported on stabilized variants of monomeric wt cystatin C (called wt cystatin C stab1 and wt cystatin C stab2) with cysteine mutations introduced for selective formation of disulfide bridges between the tertiary structure elements that must undergo separation in an unfolding event preceding three-dimensional domain swapping (Fig. 1C) (28Nilsson M. Wang X. Rodziewicz-Motowidlo S. Janowski R. Lindström V. Önnerfjord P. Westermark G. Grzonka Z. Jaskolski M. Grubb A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24236-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The stabilized variants were found to have a drastically decreased capability to produce dimers and amyloid fibrils at pH 2.0. In accordance with those earlier results, wt cystatin C, but not the stabilized variants, was found to produce fibrils at pH 4.0 as tested both by the ThT fluorescence assay and by electron microscopy (Fig. 2, A and B). After 3 weeks of incubation, a substantial amount of fibrils could be observed in the solution of wt cystatin C, while no fibrils could be detected in the solutions of wt cystatin C stab1 (Fig. 2A) or wt cystatin C stab2 (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2064672966,"The human genes MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC6 are clustered on chromosome 11 and encode large secreted gel-forming mucins. The frequent occurrence of their silencing in cancers and the GC-rich structure of their promoters led us to study the influence of epigenetics on their expression. Pre- and post-confluent cells were treated with demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A. Mapping of methylated cytosines was performed by bisulfite-treated genomic DNA sequencing. Histone modification status at the promoters was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Our results indicate that MUC2 was regulated by site-specific DNA methylation associated with establishment of a repressive histone code, whereas hypermethylation of MUC5B promoter was the major mechanism responsible for its silencing. DNA methyltransferase 1 was identified by small interfering RNA approach as a regulator of MUC2 and MUC5B endogenous expression that was potentiated by HDAC2. MUC2 and MUC5B epigenetic regulation was cell-specific, depended on cell differentiation status and inhibited their activation by Sp1. The expression of MUC5AC was rarely influenced by epigenetic mechanisms and methylation of MUC6 promoter was not correlated to its silencing. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the important role for methylation and/or histone modifications in regulating the 11p15 mucin genes in epithelial cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2070351068,"RAMPs (receptor activity modifying proteins) impart remarkable effects on G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. First identified through an interaction with the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR), these single transmembrane proteins are now known to modulate the in vitro ligand binding affinity, trafficking, and second messenger pathways of numerous GPCRs. Consequently, the receptor-RAMP interface represents an attractive pharmacological target for the treatment of disease. Although the three known mammalian RAMPs differ in their sequences and tissue expression, results from in vitro biochemical and pharmacological studies suggest that they have overlapping effects on the GPCRs with which they interact. Therefore, to determine whether RAMP2 and RAMP3 have distinct functions in vivo, we generated mice with targeted deletions of either the RAMP2 or RAMP3 gene. Strikingly, we found that, although RAMP2 is required for survival, mice that lack RAMP3 appear normal until old age, at which point they have decreased weight. In addition, mice with reduced expression of RAMP2 (but not RAMP3) display remarkable subfertility. Thus, each gene has functions in vivo that cannot be accomplished by the other. Because RAMP2, RAMP3, and CLR transduce the signaling of the two potent vasodilators adrenomedullin and calcitonin gene-related peptide, we tested the effects of our genetic modifications on blood pressure, and no effects were detected. Nevertheless, our studies reveal that RAMP2 and RAMP3 have distinct physiological functions throughout embryogenesis, adulthood, and old age, and the mice we have generated provide novel genetic tools to further explore the utility of the receptor-RAMP interface as a pharmacological target.

The identification of receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: RAMP, receptor activity modifying protein; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CLR, calcitonin receptor-like receptor; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; AM, adrenomedullin; RT, reverse transcription. 1–3 has revolutionized our current understanding of the mechanism through which class II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) bind to their peptide ligands. First identified in association with the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR; formerly called CRLR), either of these three single pass transmembrane proteins can bind to a GPCR, chaperone it to the plasma membrane, and alter the ligand binding affinity of the receptor (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). For example, a CLR·RAMP1 complex preferentially and specifically binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), whereas a CLR·RAMP2 or CLR·RAMP3 complex will preferentially bind to adrenomedullin (AM), another peptide vasodilator. Thus, the different spatial and temporal expression patterns of RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3 determine how a cell or tissue will sense and respond to either extracellular CGRP or AM. Biochemical studies using heterologous overexpression of RAMPs in cultured cells have demonstrated that this general mechanism also applies to several other GPCRs of the class II family, including calcitonin receptor, parathyroid receptors 1 and 2, vasointestinal peptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide 1 (VIP/VPAC1) receptor, and glucagon receptor (2Christopoulos A. Christopoulos G. Morfis M. Udawela M. Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Kuwasako K. Tilakaratne N. Sexton P.M. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4709-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that RAMP1 or RAMP3 can functionally target a class III receptor, the calcium sensing receptor, to the plasma membrane. Therefore, it is likely that RAMP proteins have evolved to impart a highly controllable mechanism for modulating GPCR signaling that may be broadly applicable to many GPCRs (5Foord S.M. Topp S.D. Abramo M. Holbrook J.D. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 26: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the pharmacological and biochemical study of the RAMP-receptor interaction has been geared toward identifying compounds that exploit this interface as a potential drug target for the specific modulation of GPCR signaling for the treatment of human disease (6Julian M. Cacho M. Garcia M.A. Martin-Santamaria S. de Pascual-Teresa B. Ramos A. Martinez A. Cuttitta F. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 40: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One such compound, BIBN4096BS, which is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of migraine, acts as a selective CGRP antagonist by interfering with the hCLR·hRAMP1 interaction (7Doods H.

Drugs. 2001; 2: 1261-1268PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, the developmental and physiological consequences of genetically altering RAMP function or expression in the whole animal have not been addressed experimentally. Receptor-associated RAMPs have been linked with receptor glycosylation, receptor trafficking, ligand binding, and alteration of second messenger signaling (recently reviewed in Refs. 9Hay D.L. Poyner D.R. Sexton P.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 109: 173-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar and 10Gibbons C. Dackor R. Dunworth W. Fritz-Six K. Caron K.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). However, these ascribed cellular functions are not consistently conserved among the different receptor·RAMP complexes and are highly affected by the choice of cell type and species of RAMPs studied (9Hay D.L. Poyner D.R. Sexton P.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 109: 173-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Moreover, pharmacological studies with the most well characterized receptor·RAMP pairs, CLR·RAMP1–3 and calcitonin·RAMP1–3, demonstrate varying degrees of overlap in the absolute ligand binding affinity imparted by the different RAMPs. For example, CLR·RAMP1–3 complexes can all bind AM or CGRP but with different affinities (11Udawela M. Hay D.L. Sexton P.M. Semin. Cell Dev.

Thus, it remains unclear to what degree the three mammalian RAMPs have overlapping functions or whether they can functionally compensate for each other in vivo. To address these questions, we used gene targeting to generate mice with targeted deletions of either the RAMP2 or RAMP3 genes and have determined the effects of their complete absence (in homozygous null mice) and of their reduced expression (in heterozygous mice). Generation of Mice with Targeted Deletion of the RAMP2 or RAMP3 Gene—To generate the targeting vectors, a 129S6/SvEv genomic library was screened for phage clones containing the 5′ portions of the RAMP2 and RAMP3 genes using DNA fragments isolated from hRAMP2 or hRAMP3 expression plasmids (kindly provided by Dr. Steven Foord, GlaxoSmithKline). Using convenient restriction sites within the genomic clones, 5′ and 3′ regions of homology were subcloned into the multiple cloning site of a gene-targeting vector that contained a phosphoglycerate kinase-neomycin cassette and an a herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase cassette. The final targeting vectors were linearized with NotI before electroporation into embryonic stem cells. Standard gene targeting methods were utilized to generate embryonic stem cells and mice with a targeted deletion of the RAMP2 gene or a targeted deletion of the RAMP3 gene (17Koller B.H. Hagemann L.J. Doetschman T. Hagaman J.R. Huang S. Williams P.J. First N.L. Maeda N. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8927-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, 129S6/SvEv-TC-1 embryonic stem cells were electroporated with the linearized targeting vectors shown in Figs. 1A and 2A, respectively. After applying positive (G418) and negative (gancyclovir) selection, positive embryonic stem cell clones were identified by Southern blot and/or PCR. The frequency of homologous recombination in the surviving G418/gancyclovir-resistant colonies was 5% for RAMP2 and 1.5% for RAMP3. Male chimeric mice that transmitted the targeted allele were bred to 129S6/SvEv females to establish isogenic lines.FIGURE 2Gene targeting of RAMP3.

Primers 1 and 3 amplify a 1.2-kb-targeted band, whereas primers 1 and 2 amplify a 1.6-kb wild type band. For PCR-based genotyping of the RAMP3-targeted locus, we used the following four primers: primer 1, 5′-GCCCATGATGTTGGTCTCCA-3′; primer 2, 5′ GGTCATTAGGAGCCACGTGT-3′; primer 3, 5′GCTTCCTCTTGCAAAACCACA-3′; and primer 4, 5′GGGCTAAAGAAGCCACAGCT-3′. Primers 1 and 3 amplify a 2.0-kb-targeted band, whereas primers 2 and 4 amplify a 1.4-kb wild type band. Gene Expression Analysis—RAMP2, RAMP3, and calcrl gene expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with the Mx3000P Q-PCR machine from Stratagene. Primers for RAMP2 amplification were 5′-CAGAATCAATCTCATCCCACTGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCCATGCAACTCTTGTACTCATACC-3′. The probe sequence for RAMP2 detection was 5′-FAM-ATGGAAGACTACGAAACACATGTCCTACCTTG-TAMRA-3′. Primers for RAMP3 amplification were 5′-GGTCATTAGGAGCCACGTGT-3′ and 5′-GGGCTAAACAAGCCACAGCT-3′. The probe sequence for RAMP3 detection was 5′-FAM-CACGATTCTGTGTCCAGTGTGGGCTG-TAMRA-3′. Primer and probe sequences for detection of calcrl gene expression were previously described (18Dackor R.T. Fritz-Six K. Dunworth W.P. Gibbons C.L. Smithies O. Caron K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2511-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). β-Actin served as an internal control for all reactions. The primers used for β-actin amplification were 5′-CTGCCTGACGGCCAAGTC-3′ and 5′-CAAGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGA-3′. The probe sequence for β-actin detection was 5′-TET-CACTATTGGCAACGAGCGGTTCCG-TAMRA-3′. RNA was isolated from adult tissues or embryonic day 13.5 embryos with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and subsequently DNase treated and purified with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). 200 ng of total RNA was used in each reaction. The ΔΔCt method (19Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127156) Google Scholar) was used to determine the relative levels of gene expression and shown as a percentage of wild type. All assays were repeated three times, each with duplicates. Measurement of Basal Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, and Urine Chemistry—Blood pressures and heart rates were measured on unanesthetized mice by a computerized tail cuff system (20Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Smithies O. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Urine and protein creatinine were measured at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Animal Clinical Chemistry Core Facility. Experimental Animals—Unless otherwise noted, experimental animals were 4–8 months old and maintained on an isogenic 129S6/SvEv-TC-1 background. Control animals for all experiments consisted of wild type age- and gender-matched littermates. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Statistics—Statistical analyses for multiple comparisons were performed with one way analysis of variance by JMP Software, SAS Institute. Error bars represent S.E. of the means. Differences were considered significant with a p value of <0.05. Generation of Heterozygous Mice with Targeted Disruption of the RAMP2 Gene—Mice in which exons 1 and 2 of the RAMP2 gene were deleted by homologous recombination were generated using the targeting strategy shown in Fig. 1A. The disrupted allele, which lacks the RAMP2 promoter, 5′-untranslated region translation start site, and exons 1 and 2, was confirmed by genomic PCR (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the gene targeting effectively disrupted transcription of the RAMP2 gene, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR for RAMP2 RNA was performed on total RNA isolated from whole embryos. As expected and shown in Fig. 1C, RAMP2+/– embryos expressed approximately half the wild type RAMP2 RNA levels (58%, p < 0.001 versus wild type), whereas RAMP2–/– embryos had no detectable levels of RAMP2 RNA, thus confirming correct gene targeting of the RAMP2 gene (Fig. 1C). To determine whether genetic reduction of RAMP2 caused a homeostatic compensation in the expression of the RAMP3 or calcrl genes, we measured the expression of these genes in the heart and kidneys of adult RAMP2+/– animals and in total RNA isolated from mid-gestation RAMP2–/– embryos. As shown in Fig. 1D, we found no significant compensatory increase in the expression of either RAMP3 or calcrl in RAMP2+/– or RAMP2–/– mice compared with wild type controls, demonstrating that the genetic reduction of RAMP2 does not result in a compensatory up-regulation of RAMP3 or calcrl gene expression. Generation of Mice Lacking the RAMP3 Gene—Homozygous null mice for the RAMP3 gene were generated by homologous recombination using the targeting strategy shown in Fig. 2A. The disrupted allele, which lacks exons 2 and 3 of the RAMP3 gene (coding for amino acids 19–147 of 147 total amino acids), was detected by Southern blot analysis using a genomic probe fragment located outside the areas of homology (Fig. 2B) and by genomic PCR (Fig. 2C). The correctly targeted allele was further confirmed by direct sequencing (data not shown). To confirm that the gene targeting effectively disrupted transcription of full-length RAMP3 mRNA, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR for RAMP3 mRNA was performed on total RNA isolated from adult kidneys. As expected, RAMP3+/– mice expressed approximately half the wild type RAMP3 RNA levels (45%, p < 0.0001 versus wild type), whereas RAMP3–/– mice had no detectable levels of RAMP3 RNA, thus confirming the complete loss of RAMP3 expression in adult homozygous mice (Fig. 2D). To determine whether genetic deletion of RAMP3 caused a homeostatic compensation in the expression of the RAMP2 or calcrl genes in adult animals, we measured the expression of these genes in the heart and kidneys of RAMP3–/– animals. As shown in Fig. 2E, we found no significant compensatory increase in the expression of either RAMP2 or calcrl genes in RAMP3–/– mice compared with wild type controls, demonstrating that the genetic deletion of RAMP3 does not impact on the regulation of RAMP2 or of calcrl gene expression. RAMP2 Is Essential for Survival and Normal Fertility—In marked contrast, although the loss of RAMP3 did not affect the survival of RAMP3–/– mice to adulthood, we found that genetic loss of RAMP2 caused embryonic lethality, as no RAMP2–/– pups were born alive to heterozygote matings. This remarkable contrast in phenotypes (embryonic lethality of RAMP2–/– mice versus survival of RAMP3–/– mice) demonstrates that these two genes have significantly different functions during embryonic development. Offspring from RAMP3+/– matings were born in the expected Mendelian ratio of 1:2:1 (26 RAMP3+/+:48 RAMP3+/–: 25 RAMP3–/– pups from 15 litters) and had litter sizes comparable with isogenic control matings (6.6 pups/litter for RAMP3+/– matings versus 6.0 pups/litter for 129S6/SvEv isogenic control matings) (Fig. 3). In contrast, although the ratio of wild type:heterozygote genotypes for viable pups born to RAMP2+/– matings was in the expected Mendelian distribution of 1:2 (22 RAMP2+/+:44 RAMP2+/– pups from 29 litters), the average litter size was significantly reduced to 2.1 pups/litter at weaning. This markedly reduced litter size was significantly below the expected litter size of 4.5 pups/litter, which took into consideration the gestational loss of RAMP2–/– null embryos (further confirmed by the assessment of litter sizes for calcrl heterozygote matings in which there was gestational loss of null embryos (Fig. 3) (18Dackor R.T. Fritz-Six K. Dunworth W.P. Gibbons C.L. Smithies O. Caron K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2511-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, although genetic loss of RAMP3 was dispensable for normal fertility, a modest genetic reduction of RAMP2 was sufficient to cause marked subfertility, demonstrating that the two genes maintain distinct physiological functions during adulthood. Aged RAMP3–/– Mice Fail to Gain Weight—RAMP3–/– mice survived to adulthood, reproduced, and displayed no obvious phenotypic defects until ∼6 months of age. Although the body weights of young RAMP3–/– mice did not differ from their wild type controls up to ∼6 months of age (Table 1), we noticed that older RAMP3–/– mice (9–10 months of age) weighed nearly 9 grams less than age-matched wild type mice (wild type mice weighed 36.1 ± 1.9 g versus 27.3 ± 1.1 g for age-matched RAMP3–/– mice) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, aged RAMP2+/– mice did not differ significantly in body weight from their wild type littermates (wild type weighed 28.3 ± 0.5 g versus 28.8 ± 0.7 g for age-matched RAMP2+/– mice) (Fig. 4A). Despite their visibly lean appearance, we found no significant differences in food or water intake in either young or aged RAMP3–/– mice compared with their age-matched wild type controls (Table 1). Moreover, RAMP3–/– mice, similar to their wild type counterparts, survived to at least 18 months of age with no obvious decline in health. Because RAMP3 is highly expressed in the proximal tubule of the kidney, we also compared urine volume and kidney function (as determined by protein:creatinine ratio) between RAMP3–/– mice and wild type controls and found no obvious differences (Table 1). The body weights, feeding behavior, and kidney function of RAMP2+/– mice or calcrl+/– mice did not differ from wild type control littermates (Table 1).TABLE 1Phenotypic analysis of RAMP2+/– and RAMP3–/– miceWild typeRAMP2+/-RAMP3-/-calcrl+/-Body weight (4-6 mo., g)25.8 ± 0.627.3 ± 0.824.3 ± 0.525.6 ± 0.9Food intake (24 hr, g)4.6 ± 0.24.2 ± 0.24.1 ± 0.24.5 ± 0.3Water intake (24 hr, ml)3.6 ± 0.23.7 ± 0.23.4 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.2Urine volume (24 hr, ml)1.0 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.1Urine protein/creatinine0.12 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.03Mean blood pressure (mm Hg)106 ± 5105 ± 3106 ± 5111 ± 5Mean heart rate (beats/min)641 ± 18635 ± 9605 ± 10591 ± 17Left ventricle/body weight ratio (3-6 months)4.11 ± 0.224.13 ± 0.143.98 ± 0.143.97 ± 0.17 Open table in a new tab Blood Pressure and Heart Rates Are Unaffected in RAMP2+/– and RAMP3–/– Mice—Because CLR is the best characterized receptor partner for RAMP2 and RAMP3 and because CLR binds to two potent peptide vasodilators (AM and CGRP), we sought to compare the blood pressure and heart rates of RAMP2+/– and RAMP3–/– mice to those of calcrl+/– (18Dackor R.T. Fritz-Six K. Dunworth W.P. Gibbons C.L. Smithies O. Caron K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2511-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and wild type mice using a computerized tail cuff system. As shown in Table 1, we found that reduction of RAMP2 to ∼50% of wild type levels and the complete absence of RAMP3 had no effect on the basal blood pressure of conscious animals compared with wild type mice or with calcrl+/– mice. Moreover, we found no overt differences in the heart rates among the genotypes tested (Table 1). In summary, we used gene targeting to generate two independent mouse lines with deletion of either the RAMP2 or RAMP3 genes. Gene expression analysis in mice with reduced or absent RAMP2 levels or a complete lack of RAMP3 did not reveal any compensatory up-regulation of either RAMP3 or RAMP2 gene expression, respectively, supporting our conclusion that there is no functional redundancy at the transcriptional level between RAMP2 and RAMP3 in vivo. We did observe a general trend for significantly reduced expression of RAMP2, RAMP3, and calcrl compared with wild type mice in the models we tested (Figs. 1D and 2E), which is likely reflective of the high sensitivity of these genes to altered physiological homeostasis (11Udawela M. Hay D.L. Sexton P.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Kuwasako K. Cao Y.N. Nagoshi Y. Kitamura K. Eto T. Peptides (N. Y.). 2004; 25: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical and pharmacological profiles of RAMP2 and RAMP3 appear to overlap for certain GPCRs (CLR, calcitonin, and VIP/VPAC1), our genetic studies demonstrate that the two genes have distinct roles throughout the life of an animal. During embryonic development, RAMP2–/– mice failed to survive, whereas RAMP3–/– mice appeared normal up to 6 months of age. During adulthood, the loss of RAMP3 had no apparent effect on fertility. In contrast, a modest genetic reduction of RAMP2 in heterozygous mice was sufficient to cause a marked reduction in litter size, which is similar to the phenotype we have previously characterized for mice with a genetic reduction of AM (21Li M. Yee D. Magnuson T.R. Smithies O. Caron K.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Finally, in aged animals, we found that RAMP3 (but not RAMP2) plays an important role in maintaining normal body weight; however, the physiological mechanisms that account for this phenotype have not yet been resolved. Our studies to address the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate in these mice are consistent with our recent findings demonstrating that genetic alteration of AM peptide levels from 50–140% wild type levels does not affect basal blood pressure. These results are also consistent with another recent study where transgenic overexpression of mRAMP2 in smooth muscle cells had no effect on basal or induced changes in blood pressure (22Tam C.W. Husmann K. Clark N.C. Clark J.E. Lazar Z. Ittner L.M. Gotz J. Douglas G. Grant A.D. Sugden D. Poston L. Poston R. McFadzean I. Marber M.S. Fischer J.A. Born W. Brain S.D. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Lu et al. (23Lu J.T. Son Y.J. Lee J. Jetton T.L. Shiota M. Moscoso L. Niswender K.D. Loewy A.D. Magnuson M.A. Sanes J.R. Emeson R.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 99-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have also shown that genetic deletion of α-CGRP does not alter basal blood pressure in mice. Taken together, our results indicate that in vivo genetic alteration of RAMP2, RAMP3, or calcrl expression (the receptor signaling components required for transducing the signal of two potent vasodilators, AM and CGRP) does not impact on basal blood pressure regulation in mice. Thus, the use of CLR·RAMP2 or CLR·RAMP3 as pharmacological targets for the treatment of hypertension in humans should be carefully evaluated. Our most significant data stem from the direct comparison of phenotypes for the RAMP2 and RAMP3 gene-targeted mice. Although modest changes in the genetic dosage of the RAMP2 gene have profound effects on survival and reproduction, complete absence of the RAMP3 gene seems to have little or no effect on mice until old age. These in vivo findings are consistent with the concept that RAMP2 acts to mediate the basal effects of normal GPCR signaling, whereas RAMP3 may become induced under physiological conditions (24Hewitt S.C. Collins J. Grissom S. Deroo B. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or disease (25Ono Y. Okano I. Kojima M. Okada K. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to alter the signaling of GPCRs (10Gibbons C. Dackor R. Dunworth W. Fritz-Six K. Caron K.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). This concept is further supported by biochemical studies that demonstrate that RAMP3 (but not RAMP2) contains an intracellular PDZ motif capable of binding to N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor to change receptor internalization and trafficking (26Bomberger J.M.

Thus, the continued study of these genetically engineered mouse models under normal conditions and disease states, as well as cell lines derived from them, will provide useful tools for unraveling the functional role of RAMP2 and RAMP3 in modulating GPCR signaling and testing their potential utility as pharmacological targets for the treatment of human disease.

Here, we report that RGMa bound to radiolabeled BMP2 and BMP4 with Kd values of 2.4 ± 0.2 and 1.4 ± 0.1 nm, respectively. In KGN human ovarian granulosa cells and mouse pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, BMP2 and BMP4 signaling required BMP receptor type II (BMPRII), but not activin receptor type IIA (ActRIIA) or ActRIIB, based on changes in BMP signaling by small interfering RNA inhibition of receptor expression. In contrast, cells transfected with RGMa utilized both BMPRII and ActRIIA for BMP2 or BMP4 signaling. Furthermore, in BmpRII-null pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, BMP2 and BMP4 signaling was reduced by inhibition of endogenous RGMa expression, and RGMa-mediated BMP signaling required ActRIIA expression. These findings suggest that RGMa facilitates the use of ActRIIA by endogenous BMP2 and BMP4 ligands that otherwise prefer signaling via BMPRII and that increased utilization of ActRIIA leads to generation of an enhanced BMP signal.

Members of the TGF-β superfamily, including BMPs, transduce their signals through binding to type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors. Upon ligand binding, constitutively active type II receptors phosphorylate type I receptors, which then phosphorylate receptor-activated Smad proteins. Activated receptor-activated Smad proteins complex with the common partner Smad4 and subsequently translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription (reviewed in Refs. 1Derynck R. Zhang Y.E.

For the BMP ligands, three type II receptors (BMPRII, ActRIIA, and ActRIIB) and three type I receptors (ALK3, ALK6, and ALK2) have been identified, and these receptors transduce BMP signals through receptor-activated Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8.Signaling by TGF-β superfamily members, including BMPs, is modulated by extracellular secreted soluble binding proteins such as noggin, chordin, gremlin, and follistatin (3Shi Y.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of RGMa using specific siRNA-mediated inhibition of endogenous BMP ligands and receptors. We found that RGMa has Kd values of 2.4 ± 0.2 nm for BMP2 and 1.4 ± 0.1 nm for BMP4 and that RGMa enhances BMP signaling by allowing BMP2 and BMP4 to increase their utilization of ActRIIA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—KGN human ovarian granulosa cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics.

Approximately 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without BMP or activin ligands (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). After treatment for 16 h, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined with the Dual-Reporter assay kits (Promega Corp.). Experiments were performed in triplicate wells. Relative light units were calculated as the ratios of firefly (reporter) and Renilla (transfection control) luciferase values.Measurement of Smad1/5/8 Phosphorylation—KGN cells plated to 80% confluence were transiently transfected with BMPRII, ActRIIA, ActRIIB, or control siRNA; with RGMa cDNA; or with empty vector. 24 h after transfection, cells were replaced with serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After starvation for 16 h, cells without RGMa cDNA transfection were incubated with 10 ng/ml BMP2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 containing protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was assayed for protein concentration by colorimetric assay (BCA kit, Pierce). 30 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with rabbit anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Membranes were stripped in 0.2 m glycine (pH 2.5) and 0.5% Tween 20 for 10 min and reprobed with rabbit anti-Smad1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antibody binding was detected with chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Densitometry was performed using IPLab Spectrum software (Scanalytics, Vienna, VA).Ligand Iodination—Carrier-free human BMP2 and BMP4 were purchased from R&D Systems. Ligand (2 μg/reaction) was iodinated with 125I by the modified chloramine-T method as described previously (29Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Binding Assays—The RGMa-Fc fusion protein was produced by fusing the soluble extracellular domain of RGMa to the Fc portion of human IgG and was purified from the medium of stably transfected cells via one-step protein A affinity chromatography using HiTrap rProtein A FF columns (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (14Babbit J.L.

Purified RGMa-Fc (20 ng) mixed in 1× Tris-buffered saline/casein blocking buffer (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, MD) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 125I-BMP2 or 125I-BMP4 and increasing doses of unlabeled BMP2 or BMP4 (R&D Systems). The reaction mixture was then incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C on protein A-coated plates (Pierce); the plates were washed with wash solution (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD); and individual wells were counted with a standard γ-counter. For mixing studies, buffer alone; purified RGMa-Fc alone (1 ng); ActRIIA-Fc alone (2 ng); a combination of ActRIIA-Fc and ALK3-Fc (R&D Systems); or a combination of RGMa-Fc, ActRIIA-Fc, and ALK3-Fc was incubated with 125I-BMP2, followed by incubation on protein A-coated plates and determination of radioactivity as described above.Data Analysis—Results from luciferase assay experiments are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three replicates. For homologous binding assays, dissociation constants were determined by Scatchard analysis using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The Western blots shown in Fig. 6 are representative experiments, and the densitometry data represent the means ± S.E. of two replicates. Differences were assessed by Student's t test with p < 0.05 used to indicate significance.RESULTSBMP2 and BMP4 Are Both Endogenous Ligands for RGMa in KGN Cells—We demonstrated previously that RGMa-Fc binds BMP2 and BMP4, but not BMP7 and TGF-β1, and that RGMa-mediated BMP signaling can be inhibited by an antibody against both BMP2 and BMP4 (14Babbit J.L. Zhang Y. Samad T.A. Xia Y. Tang J. Schneyer A. Woolf C.J. Lin H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29820-29827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that BMP2, BMP4, or both are endogenous ligands for RGMa. To further investigate ligands for the RGMa coreceptor, we screened KGN cells, which do not express RGMa (RT-PCR data not shown), by RT-PCR for expression of BMP2 and BMP4 and the closely related members BMP5–BMP7 (Fig. 1A). Among these ligands, only BMP2, BMP4, and BMP6 were detected in KGN cells. We then tested whether RGMa-induced BMP signaling is affected by siRNA-mediated specific inhibition of BMP2, BMP4, or BMP6. As shown in Fig. 1B, BMP2, BMP4, and BMP6 expression was specifically inhibited by the respective gene-specific siRNA duplexes (60 nm), with minimal effect on the expression of the other ligands. The siRNAs reduced BMP2, BMP4, and BMP6 mRNA expression levels by 80, 60, and 75%, respectively. KGN cells were transfected with BRE-Luc in combination with control, BMP2, BMP4, or BMP6 siRNA (60 nm) (Fig. 2A). As expected, transfection of KGN cells with RGMa increased BRE-Luc activity in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of exogenous ligands. Inhibition of BMP2 or BMP4 expression dramatically reduced RGMa-mediated BMP signaling. In contrast, inhibition of BMP6 expression did not change BRE-Luc activity induced by RGMa compared with control siRNA (Fig. 2A). RGMa-mediated BMP signaling was completely inhibited to below the basal levels by double inhibition of both BMP2 and BMP4 expression (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that BMP2 and BMP4 are both endogenous ligands for RGMa. Moreover, because inhibition of BMP2 and BMP4 expression abrogated the ability of RGMa to induce BRE-Luc activity, BMP2 and BMP4 are likely the sole endogenous ligands for the RGMa coreceptor in KGN cells.FIGURE 1Expression of BMP ligands BMP2 and BMP4–BMP7 in KGN cells and specificity and efficacy of siRNAs targeting BMP2, BMP4, and BMP6 expression. A, total RNA from KGN cells was extracted for RT-PCR to determine the expression of BMP2 and BMP4–BMP7. Purified plasmid cDNAs for these ligands were used in PCR analyses as positive controls. B, siRNAs (60 nm) derived from sequences of BMP2, BMP4, and BMP6 were employed to decrease their expression in KGN cells. mRNA levels were measured 46 h after cells were transfected with specific siRNA by quantitative real-time PCR, were normalized to RPL19 mRNA levels, and are expressed as a fraction of values from cells treated with negative control siRNA. The values shown are the means ± S.E. of triplicate measurements. BMP2 (si-BMP2)-, BMP4 (si-BMP4)-, and BMP6 (si-BMP6)-specific siRNAs reduced the expression of those genes by 80, 60, and 75% respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 2siRNA-mediated specific inhibition of BMP2 and BMP4 expression attenuates the stimulation of BRE promoter activity induced by RGMa.

https://openalex.org/W2039356709,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor characterized by rapid growth and extensive invasiveness. Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) has been reported in GBM. However, it remains to be determined how IGFBP-2 is involved in the progression of GBM. We utilized short hairpin-RNA (shRNA) expression retroviral vectors to inactivate the IGFBP-2 gene permanently in two human GBM cell lines, U251 and YKG-1. The stable knockdown of IGFBP-2 resulted in decreased invasiveness, decreased saturation density of the cells in vitro, and decreased tumorigenicity in nude mice. Transcriptional profiling of both lines revealed several genes that were significantly down-regulated by inactivation of IGFBP-2. One such gene was CD24, which has been implicated in progression of various cancers. Indeed, CD24 was expressed in most GBM cases and the inactivation of CD24 in GBM cells suppressed cellular invasiveness, as was the case for IGFBP-2. Forced overexpression of CD24 led to increased invasiveness of both IGFBP-2-inactivated GBM cell lines and also A172, a human GBM cell line with low endogenous CD24. Further supporting the inter-relationship between IGFBP-2 and CD24, knockdown of IGFBP-2 suppressed the CD24 promoter activity. Moreover, both CD24 promoter activity and in vitro invasiveness were restored in knockdown cells by transfection with an IGFBP-2 expression plasmid. These results indicate that CD24 is modulated by IGFBP-2 and contributes to IGFBP-2-enhanced invasiveness of GBM cells.

Although extensive resection of the tumor may be achieved by surgery, recurrence is almost inevitable (1Stupp R. Hegi M.E. van den Bent M.J. Mason W.P. Weller M. Mirimanoff R.O. Cairncross J.G. The Oncologist. 2006; 11: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 2Lefranc F. Sadeghi N. Camby I. Metens T. Dewitte O. Kiss R. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2006; 5: 719-732Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Even with the latest updated combination of treatments, the prognosis of patients with GBM remains extremely poor and the 2-year survival rate is only 26% (1Stupp R. Hegi M.E. van den Bent M.J. Mason W.P. Weller M. Mirimanoff R.O. Cairncross J.G. The Oncologist. 2006; 11: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Limitations to therapy include the infiltrative nature of GBM cells, their enhanced capacity for angiogenesis, and their resistance to current modalities of irradiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Therefore, effective treatment of patients with GBM requires greater understanding of the biology of GBM cells and development of innovative clinical approaches.Insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) comprise a family of secreted proteins that modulates the bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in the IGF-I/IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling axis (3Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). Six IGFBPs (designated IGFBP-1-6) have been identified. Although all IGFBPs have been shown to inhibit the IGF signaling axis, a number of IGFBPs also mediate IGF-independent actions, which could be related to tumor progression (4Yu H. Rohan T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1472-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). IGFBP-2 is a 36-kDa protein that is widely expressed in the fetus. After birth, its expression decreases significantly under normal conditions. Recently, elevated expression of IGFBP-2 has been reported in many tumors, such as prostate cancer (5Cohen P. Peehl D.M.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1652-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). IGFBP-2 may play important roles in malignant progression. For example, in gliomas, expression of IGFBP-2 increases with tumor grade (10Elmlinger M.W. Deininger M.H. Schuett B.S. Meyermann R. Duffner F. Grote E.H. Ranke M.B. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1652-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and recent studies have suggested that IGFBP-2 enhances invasion by GBM cells by up-regulating invasion-enhancing proteins such as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (11Wang H. Shen W. Huang H. Hu L. Ramdas L. Zhou Y.H. Liao W.S. Fuller G.N. Zhang W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4315-4321PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined precisely how IGFBP-2 is involved in the growth and invasive behavior of tumor cells. Recent reports indicate that interaction between integrins and IGFBP-2 can have either positive or negative regulatory effects on the invasiveness of tumor cells (12Schutt B.S. Langkamp M.

IIp45 appears to antagonize the IGFBP-2-induced expression of transcriptional NF-κB (14Song S.W. Fuller G.N. Khan A. Kong S. Shen W. Taylor E. Ramdas L. Lang F.F. Zhang W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13970-13975Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).CD24 is a glycoprotein that is anchored to the cell surface (15Baumann P. Cremers N. Kroese F. Orend G. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Uede T. Yagita H. Sleeman J.P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10783-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16Lim S.C. Oh S.H. Pathol. Res. Pract. 2005; 201: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has many potential sites for O-linked glycans, indicating that CD24 is a mucin-type protein. Although CD24 was initially identified as a B-cell specific marker, considerable attention has recently been focused on the roles of CD24 in tumor biology, in which CD24 appears to be involved in cell adhesion, invasion, and metastasis (15Baumann P. Cremers N. Kroese F. Orend G. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Uede T. Yagita H. Sleeman J.P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10783-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16Lim S.C. Oh S.H. Pathol. Res. Pract. 2005; 201: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, CD24 is expressed in a variety of tumors, such as ovarian cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and medulloblastoma, and a number of recent studies have indicated that the high expression level of CD24 is significantly associated with a more aggressive course (17Kristiansen G.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7687-7694Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although little is known regarding the expression of CD24 in GBM, engineered overexpression of CD24 in C6 rat glioma cells resulted in enhanced invasiveness of the cells in vivo (25Senner V. Sturm A. Baur I. Schrell U.H. Distel L. Paulus W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, there is little understanding of the mechanisms regulating the expression of CD24 and its role in tumor progression.This study examined the significance of IGFBP-2 in GBM in vitro and in vivo, and also elucidated the cellular pathway maintained by IGFBP-2 in human GBM cells. For this purpose, we established stable sublines of two different human GBM cell lines in which the IGFBP-2 gene was permanently inactivated by retroviral expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Using transcriptional profiling, we identified CD24 as an important candidate molecule potentially involved in IGFBP-2-induced invasion of GBM cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Cell Culture—Specimens of four cases of GBM tissues were obtained at surgery. Informed consents were obtained from the patients and the protocol was approved by the Ethical Board of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki. Nine human GBM cell lines (U251, YKG-1, T98G, A172, KS-1, U87, YH-13, U373, and NYGM) and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. NYGM was established in our laboratory (26Nuki Y. Uchinokura S. Miyata S. Fukushima T. Hamasuna R. Nakano S. Wakisaka S. Akiyama Y. Itoh H. Kataoka H. Hum. Cell. 2004; 17: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). U251, YKG-1, T98G, A172, and KS-1 were obtained from the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan). YH-13 was obtained from the Health Science Research Resourse Bank (Osaka, Japan). U87 and U373 were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Culture via Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma (Osaka, Japan). Regarding p53 status, U251, YKG-1, T98G, and U373 were mutants, whereas A172 and U87 have a wild-type p53 status. For the evaluation of in vitro cell growth, triplicate 60-mm dishes were seeded with 1 × 105 cells/5 ml of growth medium, and the number of viable cells counted daily.Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNAs were extracted with TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen), followed by DNase I (Roche Applied Science) treatment and phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction. Total RNA of human whole brain was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). For RT-PCR, 3 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with a mixture of oligo(dT) and random primer using 200 units of SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 1/30 of the resultant cDNA was processed for each PCR with 0.1 μm of both reverse and forward primers and 2.5 units of HotStar Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). The following primers were used: IGFBP-2, sense 5′-GGTATGAAGGAGCTGGCCGTGTTC-3′ and antisense 5′-CGCTGCCCGTTCAGAGACATCTTG-3′; IGF-I, sense 5′-TCAGAAGCAATGGGAAAAATCAGC-3′ and antisense 5′-TCCTTAGATCACAGCTCCGGAAGC-3′; IGF-II, sense 5′-GCTTCCAGACACCAATGGGAATCC-3′ and antisense 5′-TCATATTGGAAGAACTTGCCCACG-3′; IGF-IR, sense 5′-ACTGTGGACTGGTCCCTGATCCTG-3′ and antisense 5′-GGCACACAGACACCGGCATAGTAG-3′; IGF-IIR, sense 5′-TGAGAAGTGCAACCAGATCTCTCC-3′ and antisense 5′-TGTGAACCTGGGTCTCGTAGTGTG-3′; CD24, sense 5′-GACATGGGCAGAGCAATGGTGGC-3′ and antisense 5′-GAGTGAGACCACGAAGAGACTGGC-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sense 5′-GTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3′ and antisense 5′-GGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGACTC-3′. The PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. For quantitative real-time RT-PCR for IGFBP-2 and CD24, PCR was performed in a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primer set for IGFBP-2 was purchased from Invitrogen (QuantiTect™). For CD24, the above described primers were used. For internal control, the level of β-actin mRNA measured using the following primers: sense 5′-ATTGCCGACAGGATGCACA-3′ and antisense 5′-GAGTACTTGCGCCTCAGGAGGA-3′.Detection of Methylation—For methylation-specific PCR, 1 μg of genomic DNA was used for bisulfate modification using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen). Bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified with methylated IGFBP-2 5′-flanking region-specific primers 5′-GGTTTTTTAGGATTCGGTTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGAAACAACCCACTCTCG-3′ (antisense); unmethylated IGFBP-2 5′-flanking region-specific primers 5′-GGTTTTTTAGGATTTGGTTGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAAAACAACCCACTCTCA-3′ (antisense); methylated CD24 5′-flanking region-specific primers 5′-ATAAGGTTTCGTCGGTTCGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATATCCCCTCCGTTCGATAC-3′ (antisense); unmethylated CD24 5′-flanking region-specific primers 5′-TATATAAGGTTTTGTTGGTTTGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATATCCCCTCCATTCAATACACA-3′ (antisense). In study of the methyltransferase inhibitor, A172 and U87 cells were cultured in the presence of 10 μm 5-azacytidine (Sigma) for 4 days and used for subsequent assays.Construction of Retroviral Vectors and Viral Transduction into GBM Cells—The knockdown vector was constructed by using a shRNA expression retroviral vector pSINsi-hU6 (TAKARA Bio, Shiga, Japan). The most efficient target sequence for RNA interference was selected among six (IGFBP-2) or three (CD24) candidate sequences. The final selected target sequence for IGFBP-2 corresponded to coding region 905-925 (5′-ACTGTGACAAGCATGGCCTGT-3′) and that for CD24 corresponded to coding region 446-466 (5′-GGTCTTCATCGAATCTACTAA-3′). The following scrambled sequence of each target sequence was used as a control: IGFBP-2, 5′-ATCGCTAGGTCGGCGACATAT-3′; CD24, GGTACTGCTTAAATCATCTAC. For retroviral expression of IGFBP-2 or CD24, human IGFBP-2 or CD24 cDNA was subcloned into pLNCX2 (Clontech), generating a retroviral expression vector pLNCX-IGFBP-2 or pLNCX-CD24.For infection of retroviral vectors, Amphopack-293 packaging cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were incubated with 5 μg of recombinant retroviral vector and 10 μl of TransFectin (Bio-Rad) for 12 h. Subsequently, the cells were cultured in fresh DMEM, 10% FBS for 48 h and the supernatant containing the retroviral particles was collected, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and used to infect target cells. Cultured GBM cells were trypsinized, resuspended in the viral supernatant in the presence of Polybrene (5 μg/ml), and incubated in a six-well plate at 3 × 105 cells/well for 12 h. Then the cells were incubated with a 1:1 mixture of fresh medium and viral supernatant with magnetofection reagent, CombiMag (OZ Biosciences, Marseille, France), and placed on a magnetic plate for an additional 12 h. This process was repeated 3 times. The transfected cells were subcultured at an appropriate density in fresh DMEM containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The G418-resistant cell pools were readily established within 2 weeks.Re-expression of IGFBP-2 or CD24 in IGFBP-2 Knockdown GBM Cells—For reversion of IGFBP-2 expression in IGFBP-2-knockdown cells, IGFBP-2 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), generating the expression plasmid vector pcDNA-IGFBP-2. For the CD24 expression plasmid, CD24 cDNA was subcloned into pCIneo vector (Promega, Madison, WI), generating pCIneo-CD24. Transient or stable transfection was performed with TransFectin and CombiMag according to the manufacturer's instruction.IGF Treatment and Immunoblot Analysis—Cultured cells at 60% confluency were maintained for 12 h in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and then treated with recombinant human IGF-I or IGF-II (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 15 min, followed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline. Then the cellular proteins were extracted on ice in cell lysis buffer (CelLytic™-M; Sigma) supplemented with protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). After centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min), equal amounts of proteins were electrophoresed by standard SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred onto Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% phosphatase-free bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T), the membrane was incubated with primary antibody (see below) overnight at 4 °C, followed by washing in TBS-T and incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) diluted in TBS-T with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 hat room temperature. The labeled proteins were visualized with a chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-human IGFBP-2 mouse monoclonal antibody (C-10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (AC-74; Sigma), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 rabbit monoclonal antibody (Thr185/Tyr187, clone AW39; Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY), antiphospho-IGF-IR rabbit polyclonal antibody (Tyr1131), anti-IGF-IRβ rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-phospho-Akt mouse monoclonal antibody (Ser473), anti-Akt rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 rabbit monoclonal antibody (Thr185/Tyr187, clone AW39; Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY), anti-ERK1/2 rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-caspase-3, and cleaved capase-3 (Asp175) rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and anti-heat shock protein 70 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA).Monolayer Wounding Assay and Invasion Assay—For evaluation of in vitro motility of GBM cells, a monolayer wounding (scratch) assay was performed. Cells were allowed to form a monolayer on a culture dish surface, and a wound was made by scratching the monolayer with a pipette tip. After the scratched cells were removed, the cells were cultivated for a further 12 h. Photographs of the wound were taken at various time points after wounding.Matrigel invasion assay was performed for the evaluation of invasive capability in vitro, by using Chemotaxicell containing an 8-μm pore size polycarbonate filter (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) coated with 25 μg/well of Matrigel (Invitrogen). As a chemoattractant, 1% FBS was added into the lower component. The transfected cells (1 or 5 × 105 cells/100 μl of DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) were placed in the upper compartment and incubated for 48 or 72 h. After incubation, the cells on the upper surface of the filter were wiped off with a cotton swab, then the cells on the lower surface were stained with hematoxylin. Invasion activity was quantified by counting the cells in 10 randomly selected fields (200-fold original magnification).Intracranial Transplantation of GBM Cells—All animal work was carried out under protocols approved by the University of Miyazaki Animal Research Committee, in accordance with international guiding principles for biomedical research involving animals. For intracranial transplantation, GBM cells (1 × 106 cells/10 μl of DMEM) were stereotactically transplanted into the forebrain of 6-week-old male nude mice (BALB/cAJc1-nu) as described previously (27Miyata S. Uchinokura S. Fukushima T. Hamasuna R. Itoh H. Akiyama Y. Nakano S. Wakisaka S. Kataoka H. Cancer Lett. 2005; 227: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Neurological defects and emaciation of the mice were carefully observed every day. Eight weeks after transplantation, the brain specimens were prepared after euthanasia. The brain tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and sectioned coronally at the point of cellular implantation followed by embedding in paraffin. For immunostaining of IGFBP-2, rabbit polyclonal antibody to human IGFBP-2 (GroPep, Thebarton, Australia) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction.Microarray Analysis—Five μg of total RNA extracted from IGFBP-2-knockdown GBM cells and control cells were reverse transcribed with the T7-oligo(dT)24 primer followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using a SuperScript Choice System Kit (Invitrogen). The converted cDNA was repurified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and quality checked by electrophoresis. Biotinylated hybridization targets were prepared using the second strand cDNA with the ENZO Bio Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Life Sciences, New York), repurified, then hybridized to HG-U133A and HG-U133B Genechips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and the expression data were analyzed with the Affimetrix Microarray Analysis Suit, version 5.0.Luciferase Assay—The 5′-flanking promoter region of the CD24 gene that showed the highest luciferase activity (28Pass M.K. Quintini G. Zarn J.A. Zimmermann S.M. Sigrist J.A. Stahel R.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic (Promega). IGFBP-2 knock-down cells were seeded at 1.0 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate in DMEM, 10% FBS. Transient transfection was performed with the reporter plasmid using TransFectin, and pRL-TK was co-transfected for inner control for normalizing transfection efficiency. After 48 h incubation, the cells were lysed and analyzed by a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay system (Promega).Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed with the Statview 4.0 program (Brainpower, Calabasas, CA) and the results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Comparison between two unpaired groups was done with one-way analysis of variance or Mann-Whitney U tests. Significance was set at p < 0.05.RESULTSExpression of IGFBP-2 and Related Genes in Human GBM—We first examined the expression of IGF-I,-II, their receptors, and IGFBP-2 in surgically resected human GBM tissues (4 cases) and 9 GBM cell lines, namely U251, YKG-1, T98G, A172, KS-1, U87, YH-13, U373, and NYGM. In addition, cDNAs derived from normal brain tissue and HeLa cells were also analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1A, all primary tissues were derived from GBM as well as normal brain-expressed IGFs and their receptors. Similarly, most of the cell lines expressed abundant mRNAs for IGF receptors (IGF-IR and IGF-IIR). In contrast, IGF-I mRNA was very low in cell lines. The expression of IGFBP-2 was observed in all brain tissues, but the level was apparently higher in GBM than in normal brain tissue. IGFBP-2 message was readily detected in 7 of 9 human GBM cell lines (Fig. 1A) but expression was scarcely observed in HeLa cells.Establishment of GBM Cells with Silencing of IGFBP-2 Gene—To examine the role of IGFBP-2 in GBM cell function, we first used shRNA directed against IGFBP-2 mRNA. Initially, we constructed six retroviral vectors each of which harbored a distinct shRNA sequence for the IGFBP-2 gene. One of these sequences showed stable and significant silencing effects on IGFBP-2 genes of two different human GBM cell lines, U251 and YKG-1, after the infection of retroviral vector (Fig. 1B). The effect of stable shRNA expression was further confirmed by a quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis for IGFBP-2 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 1C, we observed a 95 or 65% reduction in the IGFBP-2 mRNA level in U251 or YKG-1 cells, respectively. IGFBP-2 shRNA also reduced the level of IGFBP-2 protein (Fig. 1D). No decrease in the expression of IGFBP-2 was observed with a scrambled control shRNA. We therefore undertook further analyses of the roles of IGFBP-2 in GBM.The basal phosphorylation level of IGF-IR was not altered by the silencing of IGFBP-2, as it was very low in both knockdown and control cells (Fig. 2). On the other hand, IGF-II-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR was enhanced by the knockdown of IGFBP-2 (Fig. 2). This observation is consistent with the notion that IGFBP-2 normally suppresses the binding of IGF-II to IGF-IR (29Kibbey M.M. Jameson M.J. Eaton E.M. Rosenzweig S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hence, the results indicated that our attempt at silencing the IGFBP-2 gene did indeed disturb a function of the IGFBP-2 protein. In contrast, IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR was not significantly altered by the knockdown of IGFBP-2 (Fig. 2). Consequently, although IGF treatment resulted in significantly enhanced phosphorylation (3-fold) of Akt, the knockdown of IGFBP-2 did not affect the IGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt. On the other hand, ERK phosphorylation was not significantly altered by IGF treatment. In addition, the consistent relationship between the expression level of IGFBP-2 and those of other IGFBPs (IGFBP-1, -3, -4, -5, and -6) was not observed (supplemental Fig. 1). These results suggested that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt system may be a main downstream network of IGF-IR in these cell lines and IGFBP-2 was not regulating the IGF pathway function significantly.FIGURE 2Modulation of IGF/IGF-IR signaling caused by knockdown of IGFBP-2. The IGFBP-2-knockdown cells (IGFBP-2 KD) and control cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of IGF-I or IGF-II in serum-free condition, and extents of phosphorylation of IGF-IR (p-IGF-IR), Akt (p-Akt), and ERK1/2 (p-Erk1/2) were analyzed by immunoblot and a representative result of U251 was shown. The band intensity was measured and the ratio of phosphorylated protein to the corresponding total protein was calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Significant Alteration of Culture Morphology Follows Silencing of IGFBP-2—Interestingly, potent long-term silencing of IGFBP-2 resulted in marked alterations of culture morphology. As shown in Fig. 3A, the IGFBP-2-knockdown GBM cells showed broad flattened lamellipodia compared with control cells in both U251 and YKG-1 cell lines. At confluency, the IGFBP-2-knockdown cells showed flattened and less overlapped morphology (Fig. 3B). This morphological alteration at the confluent culture resulted in significantly suppressed saturation density of the cells (Fig. 3C). The decreased cell numbers was not caused by the increased apoptosis (supplemental Fig. 2). The in vitro growth rate at the log phase of growth was also decreased by IGFBP-2 knockdown, particularly in YKG-1 (Fig. 3C). In high cell density, ERK phosphorylation was significantly suppressed in IGFBP-2 knockdown (Fig. 3C). Phosphorylation of Akt was not altered by IGFBP-2 knockdown in both cell lines.FIGURE 3Effects of stable IGFBP-2 knockdown on culture characte"
https://openalex.org/W2057183093,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is the leading cause of device-related infections. These infections require an initial colonization step in which S. epidermidis adheres to the implanted material. This process is usually mediated by specific bacterial surface proteins and host factors coating the foreign device. Some of these surface proteins belong to the serine-aspartate repeat (Sdr) family, which includes adhesins from Staphyloccus aureus and S. epidermidis. Using a heterologous expression system in Lactococcus lactis to overcome possible staphylococcal adherence redundancy we observed that one of these Sdr proteins, SdrF, mediates binding to type I collagen when present on the lactococcal cell surface. We used lactococcal recombinant strains, a protein-protein interaction assay and Western ligand blot analysis to demonstrate that this process occurs via the B domain of SdrF and both the α1 and α2 chains of type I collagen. It was also found that a single B domain repeat of S. epidermidis 9491 retains the capacity to bind to type I collagen. We demonstrated that the putative ligand binding N-terminal A domain does not bind to collagen which suggests that SdrF might be a multiligand adhesin. Antibodies directed against the B domain significantly reduce in vitro adherence of S. epidermidis to immobilized collagen.

Infection. 1999; 27: S7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Staphylococcus epidermidis is the leading cause of these device-related infections accounting for 74–92% of the infections caused by CNS (8Martin M.A. Pfaller M.A. Wenzel R.P. Ann. Intern. Med. 1989; 110: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The pathogenesis of these infections is complex and involves a wide range of interactions between bacterial and host factors. However, this process usually requires an initial colonization step which allows bacteria to adhere to host tissues. In staphylococci these processes are commonly mediated by specific surface proteins called microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) which recognize and adhere to particular host factors (9Foster T.J.

In the case of foreign body infections, the implanted surfaces quickly become coated with a wide range of extracellular matrix or plasma proteins such as fibrinogen (FnG), fibronectin (Fn), vitronectin (Vn), and collagen (Cn) (11Patti J.M.

Peters G. Gotz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1013-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 17Heilmann C. Thumm G. Chhatwal G.S. Hartleib J. Uekotter A. Peters G.

One of these proteins, the FnG-binding protein serine-aspartate repeat protein G (SdrG), belongs to the serine-aspartate repeat (Sdr) subclass of MSCRAMMs which also includes SdrF and SdrH, whose specific ligands have not been identified (10Bowden M.G. Chen W. Singvall J. Xu Y. Peacock S.J. Valtulina V. Speziale P. Hook M. Microbiol. 2005; 151: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). SdrF and SdrG possess features typical of other MSCRAMMs such as the cell sorting motif LPXTG, a hydrophobic region that spans the bacterial membrane and a C-terminal cluster of positively charged residues (10Bowden M.G. Chen W. Singvall J. Xu Y. Peacock S.J. Valtulina V. Speziale P. Hook M. Microbiol. 2005; 151: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). SdrF contains a 52-residue signal sequence followed by a putative ligand-binding domain, termed domain A and another region, domain B. Both of these domains can be subdivided into three and four subdomains respectively. Immediately following the B domain, a 558-residue region composed of repetitive serine-aspartate dipeptides, the SD-repeat region, is present, followed by the LPXTG cell wall-anchoring motif, membrane spanning region and positively charged residues (10Bowden M.G. Chen W. Singvall J. Xu Y. Peacock S.J. Valtulina V. Speziale P. Hook M. Microbiol. 2005; 151: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The SD-repeat region has been shown to be required for the proper display of the FnG-binding domain of the Staphylococcus aureus clumping factor A (ClfA) on the cell surface by spanning through the cell wall and has been suggested to have a similar function in other Sdr proteins (20Hartford O. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We recently found that SdrF mediated S. epidermidis adherence to transcutaneous drivelines obtained from VADs explanted from patients with congestive heart failure. Histological examination of trichrome staining of driveline sections suggested that the main host factor coating the subcutaneous part of the driveline appeared to be Cn. 4Unpublished results presented at the 106th General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, 2006, Orlando, FL. Poster Presentation B-059. Therefore we were interested in identifying the specific ligand for SdrF as well as characterizing its binding mechanisms. In the present communication, we report that SdrF binds to Cn type I. This binding appears to be mediated by the B domain. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli XL1-Blue or XL10-Gold (Stratagene) were used as the first recipient strains in routine DNA cloning according to the manufacturer's instructions. S. aureus RN4220 (21Kreiswirth B.N. Lofdahl S. Betley M.J. O'Reilly M. Schlievert P.M. Bergdoll M.S. Novick R.P. Nature. 1983; 305: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) was used as the first Gram-positive host strain for receiving chimeric plasmids originated in E. coli before their transfer into their final host. S. epidermidis 9491 has been described previously (22McCrea K.W. Hartford O. Davis S. Eidhin D.N. Lina G. Speziale P. Foster T.J. Hook M. Microbiol. 2000; 146: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (23Kuipers O.P. De Ruyter P.G. Kleerebezen M. De Vos W.M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 64: 15-21Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar) was used as the host strain for cell surface expression of recombinant S. epidermidis proteins. E. coli was grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani broth (BD Biosciences). S. aureus was grown in Tryptic Soy broth (BD Biosciences) at 37 °C. S. epidermidis was grown at 37 °C in Tryptic Soy broth supplemented with 0.25% glucose. L. lactis was grown in M17 broth (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 0.5% glucose (GM17) at 30 °C. Mannitol Salt Agar was routinely used as solid media for S. epidermidis. Other solid media consisted of the corresponding liquid media supplemented with 1.1% agar. Ampicillin (Ap) (100 μg/ml) and erythromycin (Em) (500 μg/ml for E. coli strains; 5 μg/ml for L. lactis strains) were added when appropriate. DNA Constructions—Routine DNA manipulations were performed by standard methods (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Buffer P1 was supplemented with mutanolysin (100 units/ml) and lysozyme (100 μg/ml) for L. lactis plasmid DNA isolation and with lysostaphin (50 μg/ml) for S. aureus plasmid DNA isolation. PCR products and DNA fragments embedded in agarose gels were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit and QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen), respectively. PCR was performed using Platinum PCR High Fidelity Supermix (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All recombinant plasmid inserts were sequenced to ensure no errors had been introduced during PCR amplification. Plasmids created during this study are shown in Table 1. Oligonucleotides were designed to allow amplification by PCR of the appropriate DNA fragments generating specific restriction sites on both ends of the fragment (Table 2). The full-length sdrF gene as well as truncated versions lacking either the A or B domains were cloned into plasmid pOri23 (25Que Y.A. Haefliger J.A. Francioli P. Moreillon P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by P. Moreillon). These DNA fragments were subsequently digested with the suitable restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs) and ligated to pOri23 previously digested with the same pair of restriction endonucleases. The full-length A and B regions of sdrF as well as the region encoding the mature LukS-PV polypeptide from S. aureus (26Prevost G. Cribier B. Couppie P. Petiau P. Supersac G. Finck-Barbancon V. Monteil H. Piemont Y. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4121-4129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were, in the same way, amplified by PCR, digested, and ligated to pQE-30 (Qiagen). L. lactis NZ9000 and S. aureus RN4220 were transformed as previously described (27Schenk S. Laddaga R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 73: 133-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wells J.M.

Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Histidine-tagged Recombinant Proteins—For the expression of recombinant LukS-PV (rLukS) and SdrF truncates, pQE-30 derived recombinant plasmids (Table 1) were cloned into E. coli XL1-Blue. Overnight cultures were inoculated into fresh medium and grown to an A600 of 0.3. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was further grown for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), imidazole (20 mm), and lysozyme (500 μg/ml) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were lysed by sonication (Branson Ultrasonics), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Recombinant proteins expressed, containing an N-terminal polyhistidine fusion, were purified using HiTrap™ Chelating HP columns (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions and dialyzed extensively against PBS. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal Antibodies: Preparation and Purification—Polyclonal antibodies were produced at Covance Research Products Inc. by immunization of New Zealand White rabbits with purified recombinant A or B domains of SdrF (rASdrF or rBSdrF) as previously described (29Andreola F. Hayhurst G.P. Luo G. Ferguson S.S. Gonzalez F.J. Goldstein J.A. De Luca L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3434-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Total IgGs from antisera directed against rASdrF (anti-rASdrF) and rBSdrF (anti-rBSdrF) were purified using ImmunoPure® (A) IgG purification kit (Pierce Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific IgGs were further purified by affinity chromatography with MicroLink Protein Coupling kit (Pierce Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Solid Phase Assay to Measure Bacterial Adherence—Microtiter plates (MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc International) were coated with 5 μg of type I Cn (Sigma) in 100 μl of PBS per well overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed three times with PBS, blocked with 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in PBS for 1 h, and washed five times with PBS. Log-phase S. epidermidis or L. lactis cultures were centrifuged, bacterial cells were resuspended in PBS, adjusted to an A600 of 1 or 0.5, respectively, and added to the microtiter wells. After 1 h at 37°C, wells were extensively washed with PBS, and the adherent bacteria were collected using two sequential incubations with Trypsin/EDTA 1× (Invitrogen). Bacterial cell suspensions were serially diluted, plated onto the appropriate solid culture media and quantified after 24 h. Adherence to type I Cn was obtained for each sample by subtracting the number of adherent CFUs obtained from milk-coated wells to those lifted from Cn-coated wells. To measure the competition of Cn binding between S. epidermidis and purified proteins, blocked microtiter wells were preincubated with 80 μl of solutions at different protein concentration for 90 min at room temperature. S. epidermidis cell suspensions were adjusted to an A600 of 5, 20 μl were added to each microtiter well, and incubation, washing, and collection of bacteria were carried out as mentioned above. Labeling of Recombinant Proteins—Purified recombinant proteins were labeled with EZ-Link® NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Solid Phase Assay of Protein-Protein Interactions—The interactions between type I Cn and different truncated forms of SdrF were tested following a previously described protocol with minor modifications (18Bowden M.G. Visai L. Longshaw C.M. Holland K.T. Speziale P. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43017-43023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates (MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc International) were coated in a similar manner as described for the assay for bacterial adherence, blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h, and biotinylated purified recombinant proteins (1 μg/ml unless otherwise stated) were added. Following 2 ho f incubation at room temperature, wells were washed with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) of Tween 20 (PBST) and subsequently incubated for 45 min with ImmunoPure® streptavidin, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Pierce) in blocking solution (0.1 μg/ml). Wells were then extensively washed with PBST and development was performed using 1-Step™ Ultra TMB-ELISA (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured using a Bio-Rad 680 Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—SDS-PAGE and Western blots were performed by standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using Immobilon™-P transfer membrane (Millipore). Cell wall-associated proteins were extracted from L. lactis and S. epidermidis as previously described (25Que Y.A. Haefliger J.A. Francioli P. Moreillon P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Western Ligand Blot—Samples were dissolved in Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad), either boiled or incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE through a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto Immobilon™-P membrane (Millipore) using a Trans-blot® SD semi-dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). Membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBST, washed three times with PBST, incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the appropriate purified recombinant protein in PBS (10 μg/ml) and washed three times with PBS. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the corresponding purified rabbit IgG, washed three times with PBST followed by incubation for 1 h with anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase antibodies (Sigma) and three washes with PBST. Visualization was carried out with ECL™ Western blotting Detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Collagen Type I Fractionation—CnI α1 and α2 polypeptide chains were separated and purified as previously described (30Acil Y. Brinckmann J. Behrens P. Muller P.K. Batge B. J. Chromatogr. A. 1997; 758: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS. Approximately 108 CFUs were incubated for 30 min with either anti-rASdrF or anti-rBSdrF IgGs, washed once with PBS, similarly incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma), washed with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Cytometric analysis was performed in a FACScan cell analyzer (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest PRO software. Statistical Analysis—All data from protein-protein interaction assays and bacterial adherence assays represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three different experiments using triplicate wells for each condition tested. Statistical analysis was performed by pairwise comparisons with Student's t test. Presence of SdrF on the Cell Surface of L. lactis Elicits Adherence to Type I Cn—As mentioned above, our laboratory recently found that SdrF from S. epidermidis mediated adhesion to patient-explanted VAD drivelines when expressed and exported onto the lactococcal cell surface. Similarly it was observed that the major host component present on the surface of these implanted materials was Cn. Therefore, to determine whether cell surface-expressed SdrF can bind Cn a heterologous lactococcal expression system was first used to clone the full-length sdrF gene from S. epidermidis 9491 into the shuttle vector pOri23. Constitutive expression of sdrF and successful export of SdrF onto the lactococcal cell surface was then assessed by whole cell FITC labeling and flow cytometry analysis using both anti-rASdrF and anti-rBSdrF IgGs (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S1). Adherence to immobilized solid-phase type I Cn was therefore tested. As previously reported, S. epidermidis 9491 bound type I Cn (Fig. 1B) (18Bowden M.G. Visai L. Longshaw C.M. Holland K.T. Speziale P. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43017-43023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and L. lactis cells expressing SdrF on its surface were also able to bind type I Cn at a significantly higher level than L. lactis control cells containing only cloning vector pOri23 (Fig. 1B). L. lactis pOri-SdrF cells showed better binding capacity compared with S. epidermidis 9491, which might be explained by an increase in the presence of SdrF on the lactococcal cell surface as suggested by flow cytometry analysis. This, in turn, could be due to either increased protein expression or better presentation of SdrF antigens on the cell surface. Expression and Purification of rASdrF and rBSdrF from S. epidermidis—SdrF is composed of two putative ligand-binding regions (10Bowden M.G. Chen W. Singvall J. Xu Y. Peacock S.J. Valtulina V. Speziale P. Hook M. Microbiol. 2005; 151: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 22McCrea K.W. Hartford O. Davis S. Eidhin D.N. Lina G. Speziale P. Foster T.J. Hook M. Microbiol. 2000; 146: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To further characterize the Cn binding activity of SdrF, recombinant forms of these two regions, A and B (residues 53–677 and 678–1128, respectively) were cloned and expressed in E. coli with an N-terminal His tag (Fig. 2A). These polypeptides, with predicted molecular masses of 70 kDa for rASdrF and 51 kDa for rBSdrF, were subsequently purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography and dialyzed against PBS. Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2B). Both fusion proteins migrated with higher apparent molecular masses. Aberrant migration in SDS-PAGE has previously been observed in other S. aureus and S. epidermidis MSCRAMMs and might be caused by their hydrophilic nature (22McCrea K.W. Hartford O. Davis S. Eidhin D.N. Lina G. Speziale P. Foster T.J. Hook M. Microbiol. 2000; 146: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Ni Eidhin D. Perkins S. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Hook M. Foster T.J.

These two purified polypeptides were used as antigens for the production of rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The B Domain of SdrF Mediates the Adherence of L. lactis to Type I Cn—To further analyze the SdrF mechanism of binding to Cn we created a series of L. lactis strains harboring recombinant plasmids, which expressed different truncated forms of the SdrF polypeptide (Table 1). First, an NcoI restriction site was introduced between the A and B coding regions by DNA ligation of two PCR products comprising both ends of the full-length sdrF gene to pOri23 (Table 2) (Fig. 3A) thus obtaining plasmid pOri-SdrFN8. This plasmid was subsequently digested with either BamHI and NcoI, or NcoI and PstI, purified and ligated to the appropriate PCR product (Table 2) previously digested with the same pair of restriction enzymes (Fig. 3A). The plasmids constructed in this manner, pOri-SdrFNA18 and pOri-SdrFN856, were then introduced in L. lactis NZ9000 for recombinant protein expression. Interestingly, we found that introducing the DNA fragment containing the mere sdrF signal sequence ligated to the B domain invariably yielded one or more mutations in this fragment (data not shown). Therefore the DNA fragment containing the sdrF signal sequence had to be extended to include the first 22 codons of the A domain (Fig. 3A). Successful protein export and anchor to the lactococcal cell wall was demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis of whole cells using the total IgG fractions purified from polyclonal antisera obtained by immunization of rabbits with purified rASdrF and rBSdrF (anti-rASdrF total IgGs and anti-rBSdrF total IgGs, respectively) (Fig. 3B). Flow cytometry showed an apparent increase in recombinant protein presence on the cell surface of A18 cells compared with SdrF cells (Fig. 3B). However, immunoblot analysis of cell wall-associated proteins showed similar levels of full-length SdrF and its truncated forms (data not shown). This observation may likely be due to a better accessibility to the B domain by anti-rBSdrF antibodies in cell surface-bound recombinant proteins lacking the N-terminal A domain. Therefore, relative levels of both SdrF-truncated forms appeared to be similar to that of the full-length SdrF polypeptide. Once the presence of cell surface recombinant proteins had been demonstrated, Cn-binding levels were assessed for these L. lactis strains. It was thus observed that NZ9000 cells harboring pOri-SdrFNA18 (B domain) were able to bind to Cn-coated wells with a significantly higher affinity than control NZ9000 cells containing pOri23 (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, presence of the plasmid pOri-SdrFN856 (A domain) in L. lactis cells did not significantly increase their ability to adhere to immobilized type I Cn (Fig. 3C). Cells expressing the full-length SdrF protein seemed to show a higher level of binding to type I Cn than those containing a truncated form lacking the A domain on their cell surface although the difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.12) (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results suggest that the B domain is the main SdrF component involved in adherence to type I Cn whereas the A domain does not mediate any adherence to Cn. Recombinant Domain B, but Not Domain A, Binds to Type I Cn—The possibility that other region or regions in the mature truncated form of SdrF expressed by pOri-SdrFNA18 might also contribute to Cn binding led us to analyze this protein-protein interaction using a different approach. The collagen binding activities of the recombinant polypeptides encompassing rASdrF and rBSdrF domains were assessed using a solid-phase assay in which Cn-coated wells were incubated with eithe"
https://openalex.org/W2162019453,"Previous studies have described the magnitude and time course by which several genes are regulated within exercising skeletal muscle. These include interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and heat shock protein-72 (HSP72), which are involved in secondary signaling and preservation of intracellular environment. However, the primary signaling mechanisms coupling contraction to transcription are unknown. We hypothesized that exercise-induced nitric oxide (NO) production is an important signaling event for IL-6, IL-8, HO-1, and HSP72 expression in muscle. Twenty healthy males participated in the study. By real-time PCR, mRNA levels for 11 genes were determined in thigh muscle biopsies obtained 1) before and after 2 h knee extensor exercise without (control) and with concomitant NO synthase inhibition (nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, L-NAME, 5 mg x kg(-1)); or 2) before and after 2 h femoral artery infusion of the NO donor nitroglycerin (NTG, 1.5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)). L-NAME caused marked reductions in exercise-induced expression of 4 of 11 mRNAs including IL-6, IL-8, and HO-1. IL-6 protein release from the study leg to the circulation increased in the control but not in the L-NAME trial. NTG infusion significantly augmented expression of the mRNAs attenuated by L-NAME. These findings advance the novel concept that NO production contributes to regulation of gene expression in muscle during exercise. Subsequently, we sought evidence for involvement of AMP-activated kinase or nuclear factor kappa B, but found none."

Regulation of mRNA turnover is an important process in determining levels of gene expression. mRNA stability varies considerably from one mRNA species to another and is determined by specific cis-acting elements within the mRNA molecule (1Wilusz C.J.

Song H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Both pathways initially involve poly(A) shortening that is predominantly mediated by an enzyme complex containing Ccr4p and Caf1p (4Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the mRNA is degraded in either a 5′-to-3′ or a 3′-to-5′ direction. In the 5′-to-3′ decay, 7mGDP is removed from the 7mGpppN cap by the Dcp1p/Dcp2p decapping complex followed by degradation of the transcript by the 5′-to-3′ exonuclease Xrn1p (3Parker R. Song H. Nat.

Strikingly, 5′-to-3′ decay enzymes and decapping activators are concentrated in discrete cytoplasmic foci called processing bodies (P bodies), which are sites for mRNA decay as well as for mRNA storage (7Sheth U.

Several studies have suggested that these human mRNA decay enzymes are involved in mRNA decay. Overexpression of an active site mutant of CCR4 alters the mRNA decay rate mediated by the c-fos major protein-coding determinant of instability (18Chang T.C. Yamashita A. Chen C.Y. Yamashita Y. Zhu W. Durdan S. Kahvejian A. Sonenberg N. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2010-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). PAN2 and CCR4 are the major poly(A) nucleases that act in concert in decay of normal and nonsense-containing mRNAs (19Yamashita A. Chang T.C. Yamashita Y. Zhu W. Zhong Z. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) requires PARN, components of the human exosome, and DCP2 (20Lejeune F. Li X. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 675-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). mRNA decay triggered by tethered SMG7 that mimics NMD requires functions of DCP2 and XRN1 (21Unterholzner L. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Interestingly, human 5′-to-3′ mRNA decay enzymes and decapping activators are also concentrated in discrete cytoplasmic foci called P bodies or Dcp/GW bodies (22Ingelfinger D. Arndt-Jovin D.J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). A mechanism that rapidly degrades mRNAs containing the AU-rich elements (AREs) present in the 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) is ARE-mediated mRNA decay (AMD) (25Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). AMD accounts for degradation of most unstable mRNAs in human cells (26Bakheet T. Williams B.R. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A number of proteins collectively called ARE-binding proteins (ARE-BPs) regulate AMD and can be divided into two groups by function; decay-promoting/destabilizing ARE-BPs including tristetraprolin (TTP), butyrate response factor 1, AU-rich binding factor 1, and KSRP and stabilizing ARE-BPs, including Hu protein R (27Bevilacqua A. Ceriani M.C. Capaccioli S. Nicolin A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 356-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 28Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). A current model for AMD is that decay-promoting ARE-BPs recruit mRNA decay machinery involved in the deadenylation, 5′-to-3′ and 3′-to-5′ decay (29Gherzi R. Lee K.Y. Briata P. Wegmuller D. Moroni C.

Using an in vitro RNA decay system, ARE RNA substrates are preferentially degraded by deadenylation/3′-to-5′ decay pathway that requires PARN and the exosome (14Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L.

Overexpression of DCP2 facilitates AMD (30Lykke-Andersen J. Wagner E. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Using an ARE mRNA reporter and RNAi silencing experiments, it was suggested that AMD is inhibited more when decay factors involved in the 5′-to-3′ decay are down-regulated than when exosome subunits are down-regulated (35Stoecklin G. Mayo T. Anderson P. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and is initiated from both the 5′ and 3′ ends, in which the 5′ and 3′ decay pathways are functionally linked (36Murray E.L. Schoenberg D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We investigated mechanisms of AMD and functions of mRNA decay enzymes in this process. We demonstrated that AMD is inhibited by down-regulation of PARN, factors involved in the 5′-to-3′ decay pathway, and exosome subunits. Overexpression of the decapping enzymes or individual exosome subunits enhances AMD. Localization of an ARE-mRNA reporter by indirectly visualizing a tethered yellow fluorescence protein suggests that the mRNA accumulates in discrete cytoplasmic granular structures concentrated with exosome subunits, which are referred to as exosome granules. We further showed that cytoplasmic exosome granules are distinct subcellular structures from P bodies and stress granules. Inhibition of AMD increases accumulation of ARE-mRNA in these granules. Finally, real-time analysis of the dynamics of an exosome focus and ARE-mRNA showed that the mRNA is targeted to and disappears in the focus. These results suggest that one of the pathways for AMD is deadenylation by PARN followed by the 3′-to-5′ decay by exosome subunits, which may occur in cytoplasmic exosome granules. Plasmids—A plasmid (TRE-GB) expressing the rabbit β-globin gene under the control of a Tet-responsive promoter containing multiple cloning sites in the 3′-UTR was described (31Chou C.F. Mulky A. Maitra S. Lin W.J. Gherzi R. Kappes J. Chen C.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3695-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of GM-CSF was amplified by PCR and subcloned between NotI and SalI sites of TRE-GB. Six copies of MS2 binding site were amplified by PCR and subcloned consecutively into the multiple cloning sites upstream of the GM-CSF 3′-UTR to obtain a construct expressing GB-12bs-ARE mRNA. To express FLAG-tagged proteins, a polylinker encoding the FLAG peptide was subcloned between HindIII and KpnI sites of pcDNA3.1/His A, B, and C (Invitrogen) to obtain pcDNA-FLAGa, -b, and -c, respectively. The coding regions of RRP4, RRP46, and CSL4 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into EcoRI and XhoI, KpnI and XhoI, and EcoRV and XhoI sites of pcDNA-FLAGc, pcDNA-FLAGc, and pcDNA-FLAGb, respectively. The coding region of TTP was PCR amplified and subcloned into EcoRV and XhoI sites of pcDNA-FLAGb. A DraIII-XhoI fragment containing the entire coding region of KSRP was subcloned into EcoRV and XhoI sites of pcDNA-FLAGb. An EcoRI-XhoI fragment containing the coding region of PARN (17Körner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) was subcloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA-FLAGa. Xpress-tagged DCP2 was constructed by subcloning the coding region into pcDNA3.1/His vectors. Red fluorescence protein (RFP)-tagged RRP4 was constructed by subcloning a cDNA, encoding monomeric RFP and amplified by PCR, into XhoI and XbaI of pcDNA-FLAG-RRP4. siRNAs—siRNAs against mRNA decay enzymes were purchased from Qiagen. Sequences of siRNAs against RRP4, RRP46, PM-Scl100, DCP2, and XRN1 were described previously (31Chou C.F. Mulky A. Maitra S. Lin W.J. Gherzi R. Kappes J. Chen C.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3695-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Sequences of siRNAs used to silence gene expression are PARN#1 (GGAGCUCUGUCCUAUGUAU), PARN#2 (GCAUCUCGAAGAACAGCCCUG), LSM1 (CAAACUUAGUGCUACAUCA), and RRP41 (CUAGUGAACUGUCAAUAUA). Transfection, RNA Isolation, and Northern Blot Analysis—HeLa-TO cells were transfected using Lipofectamine. After transfection, cells were treated with tetracycline (50 ng/ml). To examine mRNA decay, a 2- or 16-h transcriptional pulse was employed by phosphate-buffered saline washing and incubated with tetracycline-free medium. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated at different time points after the addition of doxycycline (2 μg/ml). Northern blot analysis using 32P-labeled RNA probes was done as previously described (31Chou C.F.

Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and goat anti-TIA-1 were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz biotechnology, respectively. Fluorescence Microscopy and Time-lapse Imaging—Cells were fixed with 2% cold paraformaldehyde for 20 min followed by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After blocking by phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 5% fetal bovine serum, cells were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG (1:5000), human anti-GW182 (1:500), rabbit anti-exosome subunits RRP4, RRP40, RRP41, and PM-Scl75 (1:500), goat anti-TIA-1 (1:500), or rabbit anti-DCP1a (1:500) antibodies. Secondary antibodies conjugated with different Alexa series fluorochromes (Molecular Probes), Texas Red-X (Molecular Probes), or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson Immunoresearch) were used. Cells were visualized using an Olympus IX70 inverted fluorescence microscope. For live cell imaging, cells were plated on 35-mm glass-bottomed tissue culture dishes. YFP- and RFP-positive cells were visualized with an Olympus IX70 inverted fluorescence microscope. Images of cells were acquired with a Photometrics 1400 charge-coupled device camera under the control of IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc.). AMD Requires PARN—To investigate mechanisms of AMD, we first sought the deadenylase involved in the decay. RNAi was used to down-regulate known human deadenylases, including PARN, CCR4, and PAN2, and decay of a β-globin (GB) mRNA reporter containing the 3′-UTR of GM-CSF (GB-AREGMCSF) was monitored in a transcriptional pulse-chase (Tet-Off) assay. Down-regulation of PARN, but not CCR4 or PAN2, decreased AMD by 2-fold (data not shown). To investigate whether PARN is involved in deadenylation, we monitored the levels of poly(A)+ GB-AREGMCSF mRNA. To obtain homogenous poly(A) tails, we performed a 2-h transcriptional pulse and isolated cytoplasmic RNA after the addition of doxycycline (Dox), which was then treated with an oligonucleotide complementary to the 5′ end of inserted GM-CSF 3′-UTR and RNase H to resolve adenylated and deadenylated GB-AREGMCSF mRNAs. A smear of truncated 3′ fragments after oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage was detected (Fig. 1A, lane 1). This smear was converted to a single species after additional treatment with oligo(dT)12-18 (Fig. 1A, lane 6), suggesting that the heterogeneity is due to poly(A) length variation. Although the poly(A) tail and the mRNA body were rapidly removed in control cells after Dox addition (Fig. 1A, top panel), the poly(A) tail was removed slower in cells treated with two different PARN siRNAs (Fig. 1A, middle and bottom panels). Quantitation of the levels of poly(A)+ GB-AREGMCSF mRNA indicated that down-regulation of PARN by the first (#1) siRNA and the second (#2) siRNA decreased deadenylation by 2.5- and 1.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 1A). The differential reduction in deadenylation by PARN siRNAs might be due to knockdown efficiency, in which the first siRNA down-regulated PARN by ∼80% and the second siRNA down-regulated PARN by ∼40% (Fig. 1B). In a similar assay down-regulation of PARN did not significantly alter deadenylation of a GB mRNA without an ARE, although its deadenylation was rather inefficient (see supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggest that PARN is involved in the deadenylation step of AMD. Down-regulation of mRNA Decay Factors Involved in the 5′-to-3′ and 3′-to-5′ Decay Pathways Inhibits AMD—We next examined effects of down-regulation of mRNA decay enzymes/factors involved in the 5′-to-3′ and 3′-to-5′ decay on AMD. Although down-regulation of DCP2 did not significantly alter mRNA decay rate, down-regulation of XRN1 or LSM1, which is one of subunits of the LSM1-7 complex required for decapping, moderately (1.5-fold) decreased the decay rate of GB-AREGMCSF mRNA (Fig. 2A). Down-regulation of each factor by RNAi was between 80 and 90% analyzed by immunoblot or Northern blot (Fig. 2C). Down-regulation of individual exosome subunits, such as RRP4, RRP41, and RRP46, inhibited AMD by 1.5-2-fold depending on the subunits subjected to RNAi (Fig. 2B). In contrast, down-regulation of PM-Scl100 did not alter the mRNA decay rate (Fig. 2B). The varied inhibition of AMD by down-regulation of individual exosome subunits might reflect the efficiency of down-regulation (Fig. 2D). Simultaneous down-regulation of two exosome subunits, RRP4 and RRP46, or down-regulation of both XRN1 and RRP46 or both LSM1 and RRP46 did not further inhibit AMD (Fig. 2B). Altogether, these results suggest that mRNA decay enzymes involved in the 5′-to-3′ and 3′-to-5′ decay are required for AMD. Overexpression of the Decapping Enzymes or Individual Exosome Subunits Enhances AMD—To further demonstrate that the mRNA decay enzymes tested above are involved in AMD, we overexpressed the decapping enzymes, DCP2 and DCP1a, and individual exosome subunits, RRP4 and CSL4, and examined their effects on AMD. Overexpression of these mRNA decay enzymes only minimally enhanced AMD (data not shown), suggesting that they are not limiting for AMD. We next examined whether overexpression of these enzymes enhances AMD in cells depleted of an exosome subunit RRP46. Although down-regulation of RRP46 resulted in a 2-fold inhibition of AMD (Fig. 3A), overexpression of the decapping enzymes, DCP2 or DCP1a, or individual exosome subunits, RRP4 or CSL4, restored mRNA decay in RRP46 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 3A). Under these conditions, RRP46 was equally down-regulated (Fig. 3B). Immunoblot analysis using antibodies against DCP1a, DCP2, and RRP4 suggested that 2-5-fold overexpression of epitope-tagged proteins was achieved as compared with the endogenous levels (data not shown). In a similar assay, overexpression of these enzymes did not significantly enhance decay of a globin mRNA lacking an ARE (see supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggest that activation of either the decapping or the 3′-to-5′ decay pathway can enhance AMD when decay efficiency is decreased. An ARE-mRNA Reporter Accumulates in Discrete Cytoplasmic Granules Distinct from P Bodies and Stress Granules—To investigate localization of ARE-mRNA in the cytoplasm, we expressed a GB mRNA containing 12 copies of the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein binding site and the 3′-UTR of GM-CSF (GB-12bs-ARE; Fig. 4A) under the control of the Tet-regulatory promoter in HeLa-TO cells and indirectly visualized the mRNA by a coexpressed MS2-YFP fusion protein containing the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Expression of GB-12bs-ARE mRNA with coexpressed MS2-YFP-NLS was analyzed by Northern blot after a 6-h transcriptional pulse. The major mRNA species are the full-length transcripts whose expression is repressed by Dox (see supplemental Fig. S3A). Furthermore, mRNA decay assays showed that GB-12bs-ARE mRNA was rapidly degraded in the presence of coexpressed MS2-YFP-NLS (supplemental Fig. S7 and data not shown), suggesting that this mRNA is degraded through the AMD pathway. Under this condition, we detected weaker diffuse cytoplasmic YFP signals and a few stronger YFP signals in discrete cytoplasmic granules (Fig. 4). Cytoplasmic YFP-containing granules were observed in ∼80% of YFP-positive cells, which did not appear when expression of GB-12bs-ARE mRNA was repressed by Dox or when GB-ARE mRNA lacking the 12 MS2 binding sites was expressed (see supplemental Fig. S3, B and C). Furthermore, these YFP granules almost completely, if not all, overlapped with RNA granules detected by in situ hybridization using a GB probe (see supplemental Fig. S3D). These results strongly suggest that cytoplasmic YFP-containing granules represent GB-12bs-ARE mRNA tethered with MS2-YFP-NLS, which accumulates in discrete cytoplasmic structures called ARE-mRNA granules. We next investigated colocalization of ARE-mRNA granules with known cytoplasmic structures implicated in RNA metabolism; that is, P bodies and stress granules (SGs). Cells expressing GB-12bs-ARE mRNA and MS2-YFP-NLS were stained with an antibody to DCP1a, a P body component. Surprisingly, ARE-mRNA granules did not overlap with DCP1a (Fig. 4A). To examine whether ARE-mRNA is only transiently associated with P bodies (24Cougot N. Babajko S. Seraphin B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), we down-regulated XRN1 and visualized the mRNA. ARE-mRNA granules largely did not colocalize with P bodies in XRN1 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4A). Occasionally, few RNA granules containing DCP1a were detected in cells treated with XRN1 siRNA (Fig. 4A, indicated by an arrowhead). We next stained cells with an antibody against TIA-1, a SG maker (39Kedersha N. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M. Yacono P. Lykke-Andersen J. Fitzler M.J. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). TIA-1-containing granules were not detected in cells grown in non-stressed condition, whereas ARE-mRNA granules were observed (Fig. 4B). When treated with arsenite, SGs were formed, and the majority, if not all, of ARE-mRNA granules did not overlap with SGs (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that ARE-mRNA granules are distinct from P bodies and SGs. Cytoplasmic Exosome Subunits Are Enriched in Discrete Granules—It was suggested that Drosophila exosome subunits localized in discrete cytoplasmic foci (40Graham A.C. Kiss D.L. Andrulis E.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1399-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We examined whether human exosome subunits are also enriched in cytoplasmic foci. HeLa cells were stained with rabbit antisera against exosome subunits including RRP4, RRP40, RRP41, and PM-Scl75. These anti-exosome sera, which primarily recognized their corresponding proteins in immunoblot analysis (see supplemental Fig. S4), displayed strong nucleolar and nuclear staining as well as weak cytoplasmic staining, which is readily observable upon longer exposure (Fig. 5). Strikingly, in addition to weak diffuse localization, staining of these exosome subunits exhibited a number of small granular appearance (granules) with small as well as large well defined bright punctate spots (foci) in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5). Because these granules and foci vary in size and number from cell to cell, we examined ∼100-200 cells for cytoplasmic localization of exosome subunits including RRP4, RRP40, and PM-Scl75. Cytoplasmic staining was categorized into two major patterns, 1) weak-diffused cytoplasmic staining with a number of small granules as well as small or large well defined foci and 2) diffuse cytoplasmic staining with a number of small granules but without apparent well defined foci (Fig. 5). These exosome subunits exhibited similar cytoplasmic localization. ∼50% of cells examined showed that these subunits are localized to small granules as well as bright well defined foci, and only small granules concentrated with exosome subunits were observed in another ∼50% of cells (Fig. 5). To demonstrate that the observed granules indeed result from localization of exosome subunits, we expressed FLAG-tagged RRP46 and examined its cytoplasmic localization. FLAG-RRP46 was observed in cytoplasmic granules, which overlapped with endogenous RRP40 (see supplemental Fig. S5). Furthermore, RFP-tagged RRP4 was also localized in cytoplasmic granules, which colocalized with endogenous PM-Scl75 (see supplemental Fig. S8). Altogether, these results suggest that cytoplasmic exosome subunits are localized to granules as well as well defined discrete foci, whose size and number vary from cell to cell. Exosome Subunit-containing Granules Are Distinct from P Bodies and SGs—We further characterized cytoplasmic exosome subunit-containing granules. HeLa-TO cells were co-stained with antisera against exosome subunits, RRP4, RRP40, and PM-Scl75, and human serum against GW182, a key P body component (23Eystathioy T. Jakymiw A. Chan E.K. Seraphin B. Cougot N. Fritzler M.J. RNA. 2003; 9: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). GW182 completely colocalized with DCP1a (Fig. 6A), indicating that the staining by anti-GW182 represents P bodies. Small and well defined cytoplasmic granules containing RRP4, RRP40, or PM-Scl75 largely did not overlap with P bodies (Fig. 6B). The overlapped signal in the nucleus was because the human anti-GW182 serum also displays additional nuclear-envelope staining that does not represent GW182 (41Yang Z. Jakymiw A. Wood M.R. Eystathioy T. Rubin R.L. Fritzler M.J. Chan E.K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5567-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Occasionally, few granules containing exosome subunits and GW182 were detected (Fig. 6B, indicated by arrows). In cells treated with arsenite, exosome subunits largely did not overlap with SGs, and occasionally exosome subunits embedded in a few large SGs were observed (Fig. 6C, indicated by arrows). Altogether, these results suggest that exosome subunit-containing granules are distinct from P bodies and SGs. Because these structures contain exosome subunits distinct from mRNA decay enzymes found in P bodies, we named them cytoplasmic exosome granules. Localization of ARE-mRNA Reporter in Cytoplasmic Exosome Granules—Examination of ARE-mRNA granules and exosome subunit-containing granules showed significant colocalization (Fig. 7A, indicated by arrows). Few ARE-mRNA granules did not colocalize with the exosome subunits tested (Fig. 7A). FLAG-tagged RRP46, which overlapped with endogenous RRP"
https://openalex.org/W2015192443,"Recent evidence implicates the neuronal transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1), expressed on sensory C-fibers, as playing an important endogenous protective role in limiting the damaging effects of myocardial I/R injury. In neurons the 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) arachidonic acid (AA) metabolite, 12(S)-HpETE, has been proposed as the endogenous ligand for TRPV1. However, whether 12(S)-HpETE underlies TRPV1 channel activation during I/R is unknown. Treatment of isolated Langendorff rat hearts with a 12-LOX/AA cocktail significantly attenuated I/R injury (approximately 40% inhibition of infarct size), an effect reversed by the 12-LOX inhibitor baicalein or after chemical desensitization of local sensory C-fiber afferents using capsaicin. Both 12(S)-HpETE and AA caused dose-dependent coronary vasodilatation (approximately EC50s of 6x10(-19) and 1x10(-7), respectively) that was profoundly suppressed by the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine, in hearts of TRPV1 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice, or by treatment with a CGRP antagonist. In addition, I/R itself stimulates up-regulation of TRPV1 expression in both the cell bodies located within the dorsal root ganglia and locally within the myocardium. Together, our data identify a novel 12-LOX/AA/TRPV1 pathway activated and up-regulated during I/R injury, providing an endogenous damage-limiting mechanism whose targeting may prove useful in treating myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2159803708,"In addition to their direct antimicrobial activity, defensins might also influence adaptive immunity by attracting immature dendritic cells (DC). As these cells have been shown to be deficient in uterine cervix carcinogenesis, we evaluated the ability of alpha-defensin (HNP-2, human neutrophil defensin 2) and beta-defensin (HbetaD2, human beta defensin 2) to stimulate their migration in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated (pre)cancers. We first observed, using RT-PCR and immunohistology, that HbetaD2 is absent in HPV-transformed keratinocytes and that it is weakly expressed in cervical (pre)neoplastic lesions in comparison with normal keratinocytes. We next demonstrated that defensins exert a chemotactic activity for DC in a Boyden Chamber assay and stimulate their infiltration in an in vitro-formed (pre)neoplastic epithelium (organotypic culture of HPV-transformed keratinocytes). To evaluate the ability of defensins also to recruit DC in vivo, we developed a model of immunodeficient mice grafted with organotypic cultures of HPV+ keratinocytes, which form an epithelium similar to a high-grade neoplastic lesion, with tumoral invasion and neovascularization. Intravenously injected human DC were able to infiltrate grafts of HPV+ keratinocytes after administration of HNP-2 in the transplantation chamber. Taken together, these results suggest that defensins could reverse a frequent immune alteration observed in cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2012506647,"Carbon monoxide (CO) exposure of an islet donor frequently leads to islet allograft long-term survival and tolerance in recipients. We show here that CO confers its protective effects at least in part by suppressing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) up-regulation in pancreatic beta cells. TLR4 is normally up-regulated in islets during the isolation procedure; donor treatment with CO suppresses TLR4 expression in isolated islets as well as in transplanted grafts. TLR4 up-regulation allows initiation of inflammation, which leads to islet allograft rejection; islet grafts from TLR4-deficient mice survive indefinitely in BALB/c recipients and show significantly less inflammation at various days after transplantation compared with grafts from a control donor. Isolated islets preinfected with a TLR4 dominant negative virus before transplantation demonstrated prolonged survival in recipients. Despite the salutary effects of TLR4 suppression, HO-1 expression is still needed in the recipient for islet survival: TLR4-deficient islets were rejected promptly after being transplanted into recipients in which HO-1 activity was blocked. In addition, incubation of an insulinoma cell line, betaTC3, with an anti-TLR4 antibody protects those cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that TLR4 induction in beta cells is involved in beta cell death and graft rejection after transplantation. CO exposure protects islets from rejection by blocking TLR4 up-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2045070144,"UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs, also termed as retinoic acid early transcripts, encoded by RAET1 genes), a family of ligands for NKG2D in humans, are frequently expressed by tumor cells and mediate cytotoxicities of natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ αβ T cells to tumor cells. ULBP1, ULBP2, ULBP3, and RAET1L link to membrane through glycosylphosphatidylinositol, whereas RAET1E and RAET1G contain transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Proteolytic cleavage of ULBP2 produces truncated and soluble forms that may counteract NKG2D-mediated tumor immune surveillance. In this study, we report that RAET1E can produce a soluble, 35-kDa protein (termed as RAET1E2) lacking the transmembrane region by selective splicing in tumor cells. The expressions of both RAET1E2 transcripts and protein can be found in different tumor cells and tissues. Preincubation of NK-92 cells, a human NK cell line, with culture supernatants from tumor cell lines expressing RAET1E2 or RAET1E2 gene-transfected COS-7 cells resulted in decreased expression of NKG2D on NK-92 cells. Furthermore, incubation of NK-92 cells with recombinant RAET1E2 protein also decreased the surface expression of NKG2D and resulted in marked reduction in cytotoxicities to MGC-803, HepG2, or K562 tumor cells. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for an immune escape mechanism of tumors via alternative splicing of ULBP RNA to generate a free soluble ULBP protein, RAET1E2, that may impair NKG2D-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity to tumors.

ULBP gene family consists of 10 members, six of which encode potentially functional glycoproteins that are located near the tip of its long arm at q24.2–q25.3, close to the human equivalent of the mouse H2-linked t-complex. This subchromosomal region is similar to a segment of mouse chromosome 10 harboring the orthologous MHC class I-related retinoic acid early transcript loci, Raet1a–d (22Radosavljevic M. Cuillerier B.

Among them, ULBP1, ULBP2, ULBP3, and RAET1L are linked to membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, whereas RAET1E and RAET1G contain transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. By engaging the NKG2D activating receptor, ULBPs can directly activate NK cells to proliferate and secrete cytokines. Co-stimulation of NK cells with ULBPs and interleukin-12 greatly enhances the production of multiple cytokines and chemokines (17Sutherland C.L. Chalupny N.J. Schooley K. VandenBos T. Kubin M. Cosman D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro, some target cells insensitive to NK cells can be efficiently lysed when transfected with ULBPs (14Bacon L. Eagle R.A. Meyer M. Easom N. Young N.T. Trowsdale J. J.

In vivo, the expression of ULBPs correlates with improved survival in cancer patients, and ectopic expression of ULBPs on murine EL4 or RMA tumor cells elicits potent anti-tumor responses in syngeneic C57BL/6 and severe combined immunodeficiency disease mice, which can be strongly enhanced by interleukin-15 (20Sutherland C.L. Rabinovich B. Chalupny N.J. Brawand P. Miller R. Cosman D. Blood. 2006; 108: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Andreas Diefenbach et al. (23Diefenbach A. Jensen E.R. Jamieson A.M. Raulet D.H. Nature. 2001; 413: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) demonstrated the efficacy of using NKG2D ligands as components of vaccine, which may offer new approaches for malignancies. Moreover, it was shown that DNA-based vaccines encoding syngeneic or allogeneic NKG2D ligands together with tumor antigens could markedly activate both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity (24Zhou H. Luo Y. Lo J.F. Kaplan C.D. Mizutani M. Mizutani N. Lee J.D. Primus F.J. Becker J.C. Xiang R. Reisfeld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been reported that tumors could evade NKG2D-mediated anti-tumor response by shedding its ligands from cell surface and then down-regulating the expression of NKG2D (26Groh V. Wu J. Yee C.

Cancer. 2006; 119: 2359-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been recently hypothesized that alternatively spliced forms of RNA transcripts for soluble forms of NKG2D ligands may be produced simultaneously with transcripts for the membrane-bound forms (34Yokoyama W.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Indeed, by RT-PCR, Bacon et al. (14Bacon L. Eagle R.A. Meyer M. Easom N. Young N.T. Trowsdale J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) found that RAET1G could produce the soluble form RAET1G2 by alternative splicing in the fourth exon (see Fig. 1A), although they failed to confirm the existence of RAET1G2 protein in the supernatants of cultured tumor cells or the peripheral blood of tumor patients. Thus, tumor cells may produce soluble forms of ULBPs to escape NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity via two different ways. First, the ligands can be proteolytically shed from the surface of tumor cells, such as ULBP2 (31Holdenrieder S. Stieber P. Peterfi A. Nagel D. Steinle A. Salih H.R. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2006; 55: 1584-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Such ULBP decoy ectodomains are “cut” by proteolysis. ULBP1, ULBP3, and RAET1L may use this mechanism because these molecules are all glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchoring molecules without transmembrane domain. Second, soluble ligands can be generated by gene-coded novel isoform. Bacon et al. (14Bacon L. Eagle R.A. Meyer M. Easom N. Young N.T. Trowsdale J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) demonstrated that RAET1G2 was generated by alternative splicing of RAET1G RNA. We wonder whether ULBP4 (RAET1E) can generate a soluble ectodomain since RAET1E and RAET1G share common structural features, which are absent in ULBP1–3 and RAET1L molecules. In this study, we first screened different tumor cells for their RAET1E transcript expression by RT-PCR. Consequently, we cloned and sequenced a novel isoform of RAET1E gene termed RAET1E2. RAET1E2 mRNA and protein expression can be detected in tumor cells positive for RAET1E mRNA. Preincubation of NK-92 cells with culture supernatants from tumor cell lines expressing RAET1E2 (MGC-803, HO-8910, and HepG2 cells) or from RAET1E2 gene-transfected COS-7 cells resulted in decreased NKG2D expression on NK-92 cells. Furthermore, recombinant RAET1E2 protein also decreased NKG2D surface expression on NK-92 cells and inhibited NKG2D-mediated NK cytotoxicities to MGC-803, HepG2, and K562 tumor cells. Taken together, our data provide evidence for an immune escape mechanism of tumors via selective splicing of an ULBP RNA to generate a free soluble ULBP protein, RAET1E2, which in turn impairs NKG2D-mediated immune surveillance. Primers and Molecular Cloning—The following PCR primers were used for cloning the genes of RAET1E and a short form of RAET1E (RAET1E2) (see Fig. 1): RAET1E-forward, 5′-ATGCGAAGAATATCCCTGACTTC-3′; RAET1E-reverse, 5′-CTAAGACGTCCTCAAGGGCCA-3′; U4a1 + a2Iden, 5′-TCTCCCACCCAGCTCAGTTAC-3′; U4a1 + a2Race1, 5′-GCCAGAACCGACAGGTAACTGA-3′; U4a1 + a2Race2, 5′-GTAACTGAGCTGGGTGGGAGA-3′; AP, 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′; AUAP, 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′; β-actin up, 5′-ATGGATGATGATATCGCCGCGC-3′; β-actin down, 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACG-3′. Cell line total RNAs were isolated with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs were synthesized with AP and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The expected sizes of PCR products were 792 bp for RAET1E, 630 bp for RAET1E2, and 1128 bp for β-actin. Cell Lines—Twenty-nine tumor and immortalized cell lines were used in this study (see the legend for Fig. 2). The CNE2 human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line, Hep-2 human larynx carcinoma cell line, HepG2 human liver carcinoma cell line, MGC-803 human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, HO-8910 human ovarian carcinoma cell line, and CHO Chinese hamster ovary cells were all cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. HeLa human cervix carcinoma cell line was cultured in McCoy 5A supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. A375 human malignant melanoma and COS-7 African green monkey kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. WISH human amnion cell line was cultured in modified Eagle's medium-non-essential amino acids supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. NK-92 cell line was kindly provided by Prof. Zhigang Tian from the School of Life, University of Science and Technology of China, and cultured in modified Eagle's medium-α medium supplemented with 12.5% fetal bovine serum, 12.5% horse serum, and 200 units/ml interleukin-2. 3′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends-PCR—In brief, the RAET1E-forward primer and AP were used during the RT-PCR with HO-8910 mRNA as the template, the product of which was used as template to amplify the 3′-untranslated region with the U4a1 + a2Race1 primer and AUAP. The positive 3′-untranslated region-T-easy vector clones were confirmed by twice PCR. AUAP was paired with the U4a1 + a2Race1 primer and the U4a1 + a2Race2 primer, respectively (see Fig. 1). Production of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant RAET1E2 was produced as a six-histidine C-terminal-tagged protein. In brief, purified RAET1E2 PCR fragments were digested with NdeI and XhoI enzymes and linked into prokaryotic expression plasmid pET22b(+). The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used to amplify the desired sequences by PCR are available upon request. Thirty ml of bacterial inoculum Rosetta-gami™B(DE3) (Novagen) containing RAET1E2 expression plasmids were grown at 37 °C in LB broth overnight. The LB broth in the overnight inoculum was replaced with 1 liter of 2× YT medium and added to a 3-liter shaker flask at 37 °C. The bacterial cell culture was induced at an A596 to 0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. The inclusion body was dissolved in 8 m urea and then purified with Amersham Biosciences HisTrap column. Refolding was performed in dialysis tubing. The His-tagged protein molecular weight and purity were confirmed by SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels and Western blotting. Preparation of Monoclonal Antibody (mAb) against RAET1E2—Prokaryotic expressed human RAET1E2 was used as an antigen to prepare mAb by conventional B lymphocyte hybridoma technique. Positive clones were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence assay, flow cytometry, and Western blotting as described (35Cao W. Hao Z.Y. Xi X.Y. Kong Y. Ma C. Cui L.X. He W. Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi. 2007; 23: 242-245PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitation analysis of RAET1E2 proteins, cell culture supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-RAET1E2 antibody 6C12 or 8C9 in RPMI 1640 medium. The immunocomplexes were collected after incubation with anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h. Cells were lysed by radioimmune precipitation buffer, and samples were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. Gels were blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked overnight with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk and then incubated with anti-RAET1E2 mAb 10F7 or anti-His tag mAb (Qiagen). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with a goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate together with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). NKG2D Down-regulation Assay—NK-92 cells were co-cultured with the culture supernatants from tumor cell lines expressing RAET1E2, including MGC-803, HO-8910, and HepG2 cell, or from RAET1E2 gene-transfected COS-7 cells or supplemented with 1 μg/μl RAET1E2-His tag recombinant proteins for 72 h. The expression profile of NKG2D was assayed by flow cytometry. In brief, cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human NKG2D mAb (eBioscience) at 4 °C. The excess probe was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell-associated fluorescence was analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, EPICS XL). Background staining was estimated after incubation with phycoerythrin-labeled isotype antibody. Cytotoxicity Assays—The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric test was used to evaluate the cytolytic activities of NK-92 cells in vitro. Tumor cells MGC-803, HepG2, and K562 were used as target cells and seeded into 96-well plates with 5 × 103 cells/well. NK-92 cells (pretreated with or without HepG2 culture supernatants or 1 μg/μl free form RAET1E2-His tag fusion proteins) as effector cells with variant concentration were incubated with target cells for 4 h. Subsequently, MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well (15 μl/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 additional hours. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of Me2SO to dissolve the tetrazolium crystals. The plate was examined at 570/630 nm in a Multiskan microplate reader (Thermo Labsystems), and the percentage of specific lysis was calculated using the following formula TOD-[(E+T)OD-EOD]TOD×100%where TOD = OD value of target cells, EOD = OD value of effector cells, and (E + T)OD = OD value of effector cells cultured with target cells. The optical density was determined at 570 and 630 nm. Cloning of a Shortened Form of RAET1E Lacking Transmembrane Region—Sequence alignment between RAET1E cDNA and its genome sequence shows that RAET1E contains four exons (Fig. 1B). We noticed that a termination codon in the intron following exons 1–3 that constitutes the α1 and α2 domains exists. To test whether RAET1E may utilize the intron to produce a shortened form of RAET1E, we designed a pair of primers matching the translation initiation codon and the intron, respectively (Fig. 1B). Unexpectedly, we found that the primers amplified a DNA fragment with the same size as that of α1 and α2 domains. To further analyze this transcript, we performed 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR and obtained the sequence of the whole long cDNA (Fig. 1, C and D). The transcript encodes a shortened form of RAET1E that contains the first 209 amino acids of RAET1E (Fig. 1, C and D) and represents a novel isoform of RAET1E. We termed this novel isoform RAET1E2. Expression of RAET1E and RAET1E2 in Different Tumor Cells—We first examined the expression of RAET1E and RAET1E2 in 29 different tumor cell lines by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, RAET1E transcript was detected in eight malignant tumor cell lines, such as HepG2 human liver carcinoma cell line, MGC-803 human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, and HO-8910 human ovarian carcinoma cell line. RAET1E2 transcript was detected in all these tumor cell lines that are positive for RAET1E mRNA (Fig. 2B). Also, RAET1E/RAET1E2 transcripts presented in primary fresh tumor cells, such as uterine cervix cancer and ovarian cancer (Fig. 2C). Next, we determined RAET1E and RAET1E2 protein expression in tumor cell lines or primary fresh tumor cells by immunoblotting and detected two bands, 35 and 40 kDa, respectively, in several tumor cell lines positive for RAET1E and/or RAET1E2 mRNA but not in cells negative for their transcripts (Fig. 3A). It should be noted that the difference in molecular weight between RAET1E2 expressed in eukaryotic cells and that in Escherichia coli may be due to the effect of glycosylation. To confirm whether these tumor cell lines can release RAET1E2 protein, the supernatants of HO-8910 ovarian carcinoma cells, MGC-803 human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, and HepG2 human liver carcinoma cell line were immunoprecipitated with anti-RAET1E2 mAb 6C12 or 8C9 and then detected by another anti-RAET1E2 mAb 10F7 in Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3C, soluble RAET1E2 protein was detected in the culture supernatants of these tumor cells. Similarly, RAET1E/RAET1E2-transfected CHO and/or COS-7 cells also generated the same bands, demonstrating the specificity of the mAbs for RAET1E (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, 10F7 mAb was specific only to RAET1E/RAET1E2 as it failed to react with other ULBP-His tag fusion proteins expressed in E. coli cells, whereas all of them could be detected by anti-His tag mAb (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that RAET1E2 can be produced as a secreted protein by tumor cells. RAET1E2 Decreases the Expression of NKG2D on NK-92 Cells and Inhibits Their Cytolytic Activities—Previous studies demonstrate that high levels of soluble MICA and ULBP2 could be detected in the sera of some tumor patients and that expression of NKG2D was reduced markedly on large numbers of tumor-infiltrating and peripheral blood T cells from individuals with cancer (26Groh V. Wu J. Yee C. Spies T. Nature. 2002; 419: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 27Salih H.R. Rammensee H.G. Steinle A. J.

Cosman D. Choi I. Cell. Immunol. 2006; 239: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Binding of soluble MICA and ULBP (sULBP)2 with NKG2D could induce endocytosis and degradation of NKG2D, causing severely impaired function of NK cell and tumor-antigen-specific effector T cells (26Groh V. Wu J. Yee C. Spies T. Nature. 2002; 419: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 30Song H. Kim J. Cosman D. Choi I. Cell. Immunol. 2006; 239: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To functionally characterize the secreted form RAET1E2, we preincubated NK-92 cells with the culture supernatants of MGC-803 human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, HO-8910 human ovarian carcinoma cell line, and HepG2 human liver carcinoma cell line for 3 days to determine the effects on NKG2D expression. As shown in Fig. 4A, the culture supernatants of the three tested tumor cell lines induced the reduction of NKG2D expression on NK-92 cells. Importantly, incubation of NK-92 cells with culture supernatants from RAET1E2-transfected COS-7 cells or purified recombinant RAET1E2 protein resulted in dramatic reduction of NKG2D surface expression as well (Fig. 4, B and C). In addition, decreased cytotoxicities of NK-92 cells to HepG2 cells were observed after preincubation of NK-92 cells with culture supernatants of HepG2 cells or anti-NKG2D mAb (Fig. 4D, upper panel). Similarly, NK-92 cell-mediated lysis of MGC-803 tumor cells (Fig. 4D, middle panel) or K562 cells (Fig. 4D, lower panel) was also inhibited by preincubation with recombinant RAET1E2 protein. Together, these data demonstrate that RAET1E2 induces decreased surface expression of NKG2D and inhibits the cytotoxicities of NK cells to tumor cells. The NKG2D ligand system has evolved to function as a sentinel system to alert the immune system in response to infections and tumors since surging evidence indicates that the ligands for NKG2D appear to be stress-inducible molecules. However, malignant transformed cells can exempt themselves from the immune attack mediated by NKG2D via several escape mechanisms. So far, at least four ULBP-related immune escape mechanisms have been documented. First, proteins derived from virus-infected cells such as UL16 could down-regulate the expressions of NKG2D ligands on cell surface and then decrease their susceptibility to NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity (36Welte S.A. Sinzger C. Lutz S.Z. Singh-Jasuja H. Sampaio K.L. Eknigk U. Rammensee H.G. Steinle A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 37Rolle A. Mousavi-Jazi M.

Casartelli N. Zingoni A. Cosman D. Rossi P. Santoni A. Doria M. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Second, shedding of ULBP2 has been described as another immune escape mechanism employed by tumors. This occurs by specific enzymatic cleavages, as seen in the processing of soluble forms of members of the tumor necrosis factor family. Shedding of ULBP2 can generate decoy ectodomain, which may have a blocking role in receptor-ligand interaction. Moreover, it is possible that the binding of ULBP2 ectodomain with NKG2D might lead to internalization, resulting in down-regulation of NKG2D on NK cells. Third, it was hypothesized that alternatively spliced forms of RNA transcripts for the soluble forms may be produced at the same time as transcripts for the membrane-bound forms. Our data provide evidence for an immune escape mechanism of tumors via selective splicing of an ULBP RNA to generate a free soluble ULBP protein, RAET1E2. RAET1E2 has the capacity to down-regulate NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicities to tumor cells. RAET1E2-mediated inhibition of tumor killing effect may be due to both blockade of receptor-ligand interaction and internalization of NKG2D as mentioned above. Finally, some autocrine cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β could selectively down-regulate MICA, ULBP2, and ULBP4 transcripts and then their protein expression on tumor cells (41Eisele G. Wischhusen J. Mittelbronn M. Meyermann R. Waldhauer I. Steinle A. Weller M. Friese M.A. Brain. 2006; 129: 2416-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Collectively, proteolytic cleavage at the protein level and alternative splicing at the RNA level may play more important roles in evading NKG2D-mediated immune surveillance as both of them have multiple effects on counteracting activating signals into NK cells. Another key issue is whether the two mechanisms occur independently or synergistically. In other words, the issue is whether alternative splicing can produce soluble ULBP2 or whether proteolytic cleavage will generate ectodomain of RAET1E. In the future experiments, on the one hand, we will use the above cloning strategy to search for the shortened variants of ULBP1–3, RAET1L, and MICA/B;on the other hand, we are going to establish a highly sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay platform for RAET1E/E2 to test the proteolytic cleavage possibility. Meanwhile, our finding will facilitate the elucidation of the relations between the quantity of the soluble form of RAET1E in sera and tumor progress or prognosis, especially tested tumors positive for RAET1E/E2 in this investigation, such as hepatic cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, and ovarian cancer. All above efforts will form an important basis for designing a new strategy to diagnose and treat the malignant diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1994851993,"Resistance of pancreatic cancer to current treatments including radiotherapy remains a major challenge in oncology and may be caused by defects in apoptosis programs. Since 'inhibitor of apoptosis proteins' (IAPs) block apoptosis at the core of the apoptotic machinery by inhibiting caspases, therapeutic modulation of IAPs could tackle a key resistance mechanism. Here, we report that targeting X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) by RNA-interference-mediated knockdown or overexpression of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase significantly enhanced apoptosis and markedly reduced clonogenic growth of pancreatic carcinoma cells upon gamma-irradiation. Analysis of signaling pathways revealed that antagonizing XIAP increased activation of caspase-2, -3, -8 and -9 and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential upon gamma-irradiation. Interestingly, inhibition of caspases also reduced the cooperative effect of XIAP targeting and gamma-irradiation to trigger mitochondrial perturbations, suggesting that XIAP controls a feedback mitochondrial amplification loop by regulating caspase activity. Importantly, our data demonstrate for the first time that small molecule XIAP inhibitors sensitized pancreatic carcinoma cells for gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis, whereas they had no effect on gamma-irradiation-mediated apoptosis of non-malignant fibroblasts indicating some tumor specificity. In conclusion, targeting XIAP, for example by small molecules, is a promising novel approach to enhance radiosensitivity of pancreatic cancer that warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2005887309,"Because the mechanisms of Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric injury are incompletely understood, we examined the hypothesis that H. pylori induces matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) secretion, with potential to disrupt gastric stroma. We further tested the role of CagA, an H. pylori virulence factor, in MMP-1 secretion. Co-incubation of AGS cells with Tx30a, an H. pylori strain lacking the cagA virulence gene, stimulated MMP-1 secretion, confirming cagA-independent secretion. Co-incubation with strain 147C (cagA+) resulted in CagA translocation into AGS cells and increased MMP-1 secretion relative to Tx30a. Transfection of cells with the recombinant 147C cagA gene also induced MMP-1 secretion, indicating that CagA can independently stimulate MMP-1 secretion. Co-incubation with strain 147A, containing a cagA gene that lacks an EPIYA tyrosine phosphorylation motif, as well as transfection with 147A cagA, yielded an MMP-1 secretion intermediate between no treatment and 147C, indicating that CagA tyrosine phosphorylation regulates cellular signaling in this model system. H. pylori induced activation of the MAP kinase ERK, with CagA-independent (early) and dependent (later) components.

Investig. 2004; 84: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), contributing to proinflammatory responses. In response to H. pylori and gastrin, secretion of MMP-7 and MMP-9, respectively, may be regulated by ERK (26Crawford H.C. Krishna U.S. Israel D.A. Matrisian L.M. Washington M.K. Peek Jr., R.M.

Because the primary connective tissue components of gastric stroma are proteins susceptible to MMP-1 degradation (29Shahin M. Konturek J.W. Pohle T. Schuppan D. Herbst H. Domschke W. Microsc. Res.

Pathol. 2003; 200: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), MMP-1 secretion may be particularly relevant to the pathogenesis of gastric damage. In the present studies, we examined the role of H. pylori in gastric cell MMP-1 secretion, and the regulation of this process by MAP kinases. We report that H. pylori stimulates gastric epithelial cell MMP-1 secretion via both CagA-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Both processes are mediated by ERK, and inhibited by p38. CagA, and particularly the CagA tyrosine phosphorylation site (EPIYA motif), is required for optimal ERK activation and MMP-1 secretion. Moreover, the pathways through which CagA+ and CagA– strains activate ERK are at least partially distinct. These data indicate that MAPKs are essential regulators of MMP-1 secretion, and provide mechanisms to explain H. pylori-mediated tissue injury. Because populations of H. pylori cells may contain variants that are both cagA– and cagA+ (46Kersulyte D. Chalkauskas H. Berg D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and because cagA+ cells may express CagA proteins with variable (0–3) numbers of functional EPIYA motifs (47Aras R.A. Lee Y. Kim S.K. Israel D. Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 188: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), variation in cagA genotypes within the total population may regulate the signal intensity leading to MMP-1 secretion.

In contrast, strains 147A and 147C are clonally derived cagI+ strains that were isolated from different gastric regions of the same patient, and are nearly identical except for sequence differences in the 3′ end of cagA. 147C possesses a C-type EPIYA motif that is absent in 147A. Because the C-type EPIYA tyrosine in 147C is the target for CagA phosphorylation by the host cell kinase Src, 147A is not susceptible to phosphorylation (47Aras R.A. Lee Y. Kim S.K. Israel D. Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 188: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Strain 7bqs, used to derive the 7bqs cagA construct, was obtained from a different host than 147A and 147C (47Aras R.A. Lee Y. Kim S.K. Israel D. Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. J. Infect.

Cell Culture and Cell Treatment—AGS cells (American Type Culture Collection Number CRL-1739)), a human cell line derived from a gastric epithelial tumor (49Barranco S.C. Townsend Jr., C.M.

Cells grown to near confluence were serum-starved for 24 h (0% fetal bovine serum), followed by equilibration with fresh medium for 30–60 min prior to co-culture with H. pylori and/or other treatments. Unless otherwise specified, the following concentrations of reagents were used: UO126, SB203580, and SB202190 each at 10 μm; PD98059 at 50 μm. AGS Cell Co-culture and Transfection—Serum-starved AGS cells were co-cultured with H. pylori cells of strain Tx30a, 147A, or 147C, at a ratio of 100 bacterial cells/AGS cell. The cultures were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C, and supernatants collected, concentrated, and analyzed, as described (23Pillinger M.H. Marjanovic N. Kim S.Y. Scher J.U. Izmirly P.

Adherent cells were washed 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 105 kallikrein units/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, anti-pain, and pepstatin) for 20 min at 4 °C, as described (36Pillinger M.H. Rosenthal P.B. Tolani S.N. Apsel B. Dinsell V. Greenberg J. Chan E.S. Gomez P.F. Abramson S.B. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6080-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and lysates collected and used directly or frozen for further study. AGS cells grown to ∼50% confluence were transfected using the Superfect™ transfection system, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Typically, 15 μl of Superfect™ was used/5 μg of DNA/well in 6-well plates. UO126, PD98059, SB203580, or SB202190 was added to cells at the time of transfection. After 2–3 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium (still containing the appropriate inhibitor), incubation was continued, and supernatant and/or lysates analyzed for MMP-1, ERK, or CagA. Immunoblotting and Determination of Raf, MEK, and ERK Activation—For analysis of intracellular proteins from experimentally treated or control AGS cells, equivalent amounts of each lysate were supplemented with Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. For ERK activation, antibodies directed against the phosphorylated active forms of ERK1/2 were employed (1:400). Membranes were subsequently stripped and reblotted for total ERK1/2 (1:800), and ERK activation reported as phosphorylated ERK/total ERK. MEK and Raf activation levels were similarly determined, using antibodies for the phosphorylated and total populations of MEK and Raf. For CagA determinations, lysates were analyzed using anti-CagA antiserum (1:2000). For MMP-1 determinations, supernatants were concentrated in Centricon™ centrifugal filter devices (Mr cutoff 30,000) for 35 min at 5,000 × g at 4 °C. Volume equivalents were assayed for MMP-1 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-MMP-1 antiserum (1:400). In each case, immunoblots were resolved by incubating with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, imaged by chemiluminescence and autoradiography according to the manufacturer's instructions, and quantitated by densitometry (36Pillinger M.H.

Ras Activation—Ras activity was determined as the binding to Ras of the Ras-binding domain (RBD domain) of Raf, determined using an ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids—The cagA open reading frames in H. pylori strains 147A, 147C, and 7bqs were generated by PCR amplifying the coding regions from DNA purified from the H. pylori cells using forward and reverse primers (EGFPSAC5 (5′-TAAGGAGAGCTCATGACTAACGAAACTATTGAT) and SPKPN3m (5′-TTCCTTGGTACCTTAAGATTTTTGGAAACCACCT) for 147A cagA and 147C cagA, and SPSAC5 (5′-TAAGGAGAGCTCATGACTAACGAAAC) and SPKPN3 (5′-TTCCTTGGTACCTTAAGATTTTTGGAAAC) for 7bqs-cagA), as previously reported (47Aras R.A.

Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The resultant amplicons were inserted in-frame into SacI and KpnI sites in the multiple cloning region of the pSP65SRα mammalian expression vector. All constructs were verified by sequencing. 147A, 147C, and 7bqs have zero, one, and two type C EPIYA tyrosine phosphorylation motifs, respectively (47Aras R.A. Lee Y. Kim S.K. Israel D. Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 188: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). H. pylori Stimulates MMP-1 Secretion from AGS Cells via cagI-dependent and -independent Processes—Co-culture of AGS cells overnight with strain Tx30a, lacking the cagI, stimulated MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 1, A and B). Co-culture with strain 147C (cagA+) resulted in significantly increased MMP-1 secretion relative to Tx30a, whereas strain 147A (cagA+, but lacking the EPIYA tyrosine phosphorylation site) induced intermediate levels of MMP-1 secretion. Whereas immunoblotting of AGS cell lysates confirmed that cells co-cultured with strain Tx30a contained no CagA protein, AGS cells co-cultured with strains 147A and 147C had CagA introduced; 147C CagA was slightly greater in molecular weight than 147A CagA, consistent with the presence of an additional indel encoding the EPIYA motif (47Aras R.A. Lee Y. Kim S.K. Israel D. Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 188: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CagA expression was consistently higher in cells co-cultured with strain 147C (Fig. 1, A and B). The kinetics of MMP-1 secretion varied between strains (Fig. 1C). MMP-1 secretion was observed earliest for cells co-cultured with strain 147C, followed by 147A, then Tx30a. These data indicate that H. pylori can stimulate MMP-1 secretion in the absence of the cagI, but that its presence increases MMP-1 secretion. Moreover, the presence of a tyrosine phosphorylation site on the CagA protein is associated with increased, and more rapid, MMP-1 secretion. H. pylori Stimulates ERK Activation via cag-dependent and -independent Processes—Because MMP-1 secretion in other cell types is ERK-dependent (36Pillinger M.H. Rosenthal P.B. Tolani S.N. Apsel B.

Slingluff Jr., C.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33168-33176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we examined AGS cell ERK activation in response to H. pylori. Co-culture of AGS cells with strains Tx30a, 147A, or 147C resulted in rapid (15 min) ERK activation (Fig. 2A). The degree of ERK activation induced after 15 min did not differ significantly between the cagA+ and cagA– strains (Tx30a versus 147A, p = 0.8; Tx30a versus 147C, p = 0.2; 147A versus 147C, p = 0.3). The cagA+ strains additionally induced a delayed (1–2 h) peak of ERK activation that was not observed with strain Tx30a (Fig. 2, A and B). This second peak was more prominent, and of longer duration, in cells co-cultured with strain 147C, suggesting that the CagA EPIYA tyrosine phosphorylation site is required for optimal delayed ERK activation. Co-culture of the AGS cells with H. pylori did not affect total ERK levels (not shown). CagA protein was not observed in AGS cells after 15 min of H. pylori 147A or 147C co-culture, but was present as early as 30 min after co-incubation with either of the strains (Fig. 2B). Thus, the kinetics of CagA expression in AGS cells was consistent with a role for CagA in late, but not early phase ERK activation. Despite the continuing, and indeed increasing presence of 147A or 147C proteins in AGS cells exposed to these H. pylori strains, ERK activation was transient, indicating that regulatory pathways may limit ERK activation in response to CagA. These data indicate that ERK activation by H. pylori is biphasic, with an early phase of CagA-independent ERK activation followed later by a larger, activation of ERK only in cagA+ strains. To determine the pathway(s) through which H. pylori acts to activate ERK, we tested the effect of H. pylori infection on Ras, Raf, and MEK. These proteins constitute the canonical signaling cascade, activated by engagement of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and other protein tyrosine kinase receptors, leading to ERK activation. EGF-stimulated Ras, Raf, and MEK activation after 15 min, with a lesser degree of activation of each after 2 h (data not shown). Incubation of AGS cells with Tx30a, 147A, or 147C H. pylori cells for 15 min had no effect on Ras activation (Fig. 3A), whereas all three strains induced equivalent levels of both Raf and MEK activation after 15 min (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, rapid, CagA-independent ERK activation by H. pylori appears to involve Raf and MEK, but not Ras activation. After 2 h of co-incubation, strain Tx30a did not induce the activation of Ras, Raf, or MEK (Fig. 3, D and E). In contrast, 2 h of incubation with strains 147A or 147C resulted in stimulation of Ras, as well as Raf and MEK, with 147C providing the more potent stimulus. Thus, early CagA-independent ERK activation, and later CagA-dependent ERK activation in response to H. pylori, proceed according to partially divergent signaling pathways. H. pylori-induced MMP-1 Secretion Is ERK-dependent—To determine whether H. pylori-induced MMP-1 secretion was ERK-dependent, we used UO126 (54Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2036850274,"CD99 gene encodes two distinct proteins, produced by alternative splicing of CD99 gene transcript. Full-length CD99 isoform (CD99wt) is formed by an extracellular domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a 36 amino-acid intracytoplasmic domain, which is partially deleted in the truncated, short form (CD99sh). A differential expression of these two CD99 molecules can lead to distinct functional outcomes in lymphocytes. To investigate the functional effects of CD99 molecules on malignancy, forced overexpression of the two CD99 isoforms was induced in osteosarcoma and prostate cancer cells. The two isoforms exhibited opposite functions: the major form dramatically inhibits anchorage-independent growth, anoikis resistance, migration and metastasis, whereas the CD99sh remarkably favours the phenomena. A mechanistic analysis of CD99-transfected osteosarcoma cells points to involvement of c-Src family kinase activity in regulating CD99 functions in malignancy. Ser168 residue of CD99 plays a pivotal role in the reversion of the malignant phenotype. Our findings highlight the involvement of CD99 in crucial processes of cancer malignancy, serving as a curtain raiser for this, so far neglected molecule. In addition, a dualistic role for the two CD99 isoforms was shown in agreement with what was observed for other cell adhesion molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2060281247,"ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase-1) is a glutamyl endopeptidase capable of generating catabolic fragments of aggrecan analogous to those released from articular cartilage during degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis. Efficient aggrecanase activity requires the presence of sulfated glycosaminoglycans attached to the aggrecan core protein, implying the contribution of substrate recognition/binding site(s) to ADAMTS-4 activity. In this study, we developed a sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer peptide assay with a Km in the 10 μm range and utilized this assay to demonstrate that inhibition of full-length ADAMTS-4 by full-length TIMP-3 (a physiological inhibitor of metalloproteinases) is enhanced in the presence of aggrecan. Our data indicate that this interaction is mediated largely through the binding of glycosaminoglycans (specifically chondroitin 6-sulfate) of aggrecan to binding sites in the thrombospondin type 1 motif and spacer domains of ADAMTS-4 to form a complex with an improved binding affinity for TIMP-3 over free ADAMTS-4. The results of this study therefore indicate that the cartilage environment can modulate the function of enzyme-inhibitor systems and could have relevance for therapeutic approaches to aggrecanase modulation.

The disintegrin metalloproteinases with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) 3The abbreviations used are: ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; TSP-1, thrombospondin type 1; GAGs, glycosaminoglycans; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FAM, carboxyfluorescein; TAMRA, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; BisTris propane, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane. are a novel family of extracellular proteases forming an integral part of the extracellular matrix itself. Along with serine proteases, matrix metalloproteinases, bone morphogenetic protein-1/tolloid metalloproteinases, and ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) proteins, ADAMTS proteins play a pivotal role in the proteolytic processing and turnover of the component molecules of the extracellular matrix of a broad range of tissues and have potential roles in the turnover of cell-surface proteins. ADAMTS proteins share the characteristic protease, disintegrin-like, and cysteine-rich domains in common with ADAM proteins, but differ in being soluble rather than membrane-bound and by the presence of thrombospondin type 1 (TSP-1) repeats (1Tang B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 2Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). ADAMTS-2, -3, and -14 are potential procollagen N-proteinases, and ADAMTS-13 has been identified as a von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease. ADAMTS-4 is a member of the “angiogenesis/aggrecanase” group of ADAMTS proteases (which also includes ADAMTS-1, -5, -8, -9, and -15) and is unique among the currently known ADAMTS proteases in containing only a single TSP-1-like motif, located between its disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains, and lacking any C-terminal TSP-1-like repeats (see Fig. 1). Like the other members of the angiogenesis/aggrecanase group and ADAMTS-9, ADAMTS-4 has been demonstrated to act as an aggrecanase in vitro. In common with other aggrecanases, ADAMTS-4 is able to cleave aggrecan at multiple sites (five in total) (see Fig. 1) (3Struglics A. Larsson S. Pratta M.A. Kumar S. Lark W. Lohmander L.S Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2006; 14: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); however, it is one of only four that cleave aggrecan at the Glu373-Ala374 “interglobulin domain” cleavage site (the others being ADAMTS-1, -5, and -8, which cleave with varying affinities). Aggrecan is a proteoglycan that is present in articular cartilage and that plays an important role in the ability of cartilage to withstand damage during the mechanical compression of a joint; thus, aggrecanases represent a potential target for the treatment of both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (4Cal S.

The efficient cleavage of aggrecan by ADAMTS-4 has been shown to require the presence of both the sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs; chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate) attached to the aggrecan core protein and the TSP-1-like motif of ADAMTS-4, which contains a putative GAG-binding site. The treatment of bovine aggrecan to remove keratan sulfate was shown to result in loss of cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 cleavage site (7Tortorella M. Pratta M. Liu R.Q. Abbaszade I. Ross H. Burn T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39096-39102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal domains of ADAMTS-4 (cysteinerich/spacer) have been shown to interact directly with the GAG side chains of aggrecan to inhibit cleavage at Glu373-Ala374, with C-terminal truncation of these domains resulting in markedly increased activity relative to the full-length protein. Indeed, with the spacer domain intact, full-length ADAMTS-4 demonstrates only a relatively weak activity at the bond between Glu373 and Ala374, instead cleaving preferentially at sites in the chondroitin sulfate-rich region (see Fig. 1) (5Porter S. Clark I.M. Kevorkian L. Edwards D.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 9Kashiwagi M. Enghild J. Gendron C. Hughes C. Caterson B. Itoh Y. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10109-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Autocatalytic processing of ADAMTS-4 (68 kDa) has been demonstrated, resulting in the production of two smaller isoforms of 53 and 40 kDa through cleavage within the spacer and cysteine-rich domains, respectively (10Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42775-42780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, membrane type 4 matrix metalloproteinase has been shown to remove the spacer domain of ADAMTS-4 (11Gao G. Plaas A. Thompson V.P. Jin S. Zuo F. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10042-10051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that proteolytic modulation of these interactions may represent a regulatory mechanism in vivo. Although there is plenty of evidence for the importance of these C-terminal domains in the interactions between ADAMTS-4 and its physiological substrates, no investigation has yet studied their effects on the inhibitory action of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP), a series of well described inhibitors of ADAMTS-4 (12Hashimoto G. Aoki T. Nakamura H. Tanzawa K. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Of the four currently identified species of TIMP, only TIMP-3 has shown potent inhibition of aggrecanase activity by ADAMTS-4 (Ki = 7.9 nm), and TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are inhibitory at higher concentrations (Ki ≥ 350 nm) (12Hashimoto G. Aoki T. Nakamura H. Tanzawa K. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). At present, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of TIMP inhibition of ADAMTS-4 in vivo remain undefined. In this study, we propose that TIMP interactions are selectively regulated by electrostatic modification of the C-terminal domains of ADAMTS-4 by aggrecan GAGs, invoking a mechanism independent of the conformational state of the catalytic cleft. Materials—Unless stated otherwise, all reagents were from Sigma (Poole, UK). Full-length TIMP-1 was produced according to the method described by Murphy et al. (14Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Full-length TIMP-3 was purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK) (15Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14313-14318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Both glycosylated and deglycosylated (chondroitinases A, B, and C and keratanases I and II) pig laryngeal aggrecans (domains A1–D1) were kindly provided by Prof. Amanda Fosang (Melbourne University, Melbourne, Australia). Chondroitin 4-sulfate was purchased from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK), and chondroitin 6-sulfate was from Sigma. Keratan sulfate was purchased from Europa Bioproducts (Ely, UK). Identification of a Human ADAMTS-4 Substrate from a Phage-displayed Peptide Library and Synthesis of Fluorescent Peptide Substrate—An M13 phage-displayed 10-mer random peptide library (fGWmAb179X10) was constructed by inserting a partially degenerated DNA cassette into BbsI-digested phage display vector fGW (16Deng S-J. Pearce K.H Dixon E.P Hartley K.A Stanley T.B Lobe D.A Garvey E.P Kost T.A Petty R.L Rocque W.J Alexander K.A Underwood M.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2637-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The DNA cassette encoded the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 179 tag (ACLEPYTACD) immediately downstream of the M13 gene III signal sequence and a 10-residue stretch of random amino acids (ACLEPYTACDSAXGGGGS, where X represents any of the 20 common amino acids). Following library phage preparation, a small fraction of transformed Escherichia coli MC1061 cells was plated on LB/tetracycline plates to determine the total number of primary transformants, which was estimated to be ∼8.5 × 109. A total of 1 × 1012 fGWmAb179X10 phage were digested at 37 °C for 1 h by 10 nm human aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4) in a 250-μl reaction mixture containing 1× aggrecanase-1 buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 m EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm. mAb 179 (100 μg) was added to the terminated reaction mixture, followed by the addition of bovine serum albumin to 0.1%. After 30 min of incubation on ice, allowing mAb 179 to capture uncleaved phage, Pansorbin cells (100 μl) were added, and the reaction mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant containing cleaved phage was recovered. The uncleaved phage-mAb complex bound to Pansorbin cells in the pellet was discarded. Phage in the supernatant was transfected into E. coli K91 cells and amplified overnight at 37 °C. Phage in a small aliquot of the supernatant was titered on E. coli K91 cells. The above screening was performed for five rounds as described previously except only mAb 179 was used (17Deng S-J. Bickett D.M Mitchell J.L Lambert M.H Blackburn R.K Carter H.L Neugebauer III, J.

Single phage clones selected by human ADAMTS-4 were picked randomly and grown in 4 ml of LB medium for isolation of DNA for sequencing. A human ADAMTS-4 substrate with a peptide sequence of AELQGRPISIA was identified. This sequence was then used to construct a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptide substrate, carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-AELQGRPISIAK-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA), using the FRET pairs fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine and the protocol described by Pope et al. (18Pope A. Haupts U. Moore K. Drug Discov. Today. 2001; 4: 350-362Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and Alvarez-Iglesias et al. (19Alvarez-Iglesias M. Wayne G. O'Dea K. Amour A. Takata M. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant ADAMTS-4—A total of five isoforms of ADAMTS-4 were used in this study (see Fig. 1). The full-length mature form of ADAMTS-4 with a C-terminally His-tagged sequence (TS4-1) was expressed in an Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-expressing human embryonic kidney 293 cell line and purified from conditioned medium by chromatography on a Radial Q column and heparin-Sepharose. Two C-terminal domain deletion enzymes containing both catalytic and disintegrin domains (TS4-4) and the catalytic domain alone (TS4-5) were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells with a C-terminally His-tagged sequence and purified from diafiltered insect cell culture supernatants by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) chromatography. In addition, a C-terminal domain deletion enzyme containing the catalytic, disintegrin, and thrombospondin domains (TS4-3) with a C-terminal His tag expressed in a baculovirus system and purified from insect cell culture supernatants was purchased from Calbiochem. Proteolytic Cleavage of ADAMTS-4 to Generate TS4-2* (p53)—The method used to generate TS4-2* (Fig. 1) was based on the method described by Flannery et al. (10Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. J. Biol.

Purified His6-labeled recombinant ADAMTS-4 (68,000 Da) was diluted to 12.5 μg/ml in Tris acetate (pH 7.3), 5 mm CaCl2, and 100 mm NaCl and incubated at 37 °C for 64 h. Reaction products were purified through multiple Ni-NTA spin columns (Qiagen Inc., Crawley, UK) to remove uncleaved protein. Proteolytically cleaved ADAMTS-4 was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting with mAb 16297 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). A single C-terminally truncated isoform of ADAMTS-4 (TS4-2*), approximating in size that described for ADAMTS-4 (p53) by Flannery et al. (10Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A.

(9Kashiwagi M. Enghild J. Gendron C. Hughes C. Caterson B. Itoh Y. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10109-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), was confirmed (Fig. 2A). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectroscopy of a trypsin digestion of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel-excised band corresponding to TS4-2* further confirmed that ADAMTS-4 truncation had occurred downstream (C-terminal) of Arg656 (Fig. 2B), also in agreement with the Lys694-Phe695 cleavage site proposed by Flannery et al. Analysis of Enzyme Activity—Enzyme activity measurements were performed by continuous monitoring of peptide cleavage, i.e. real-time increases in fluorescence intensity, at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm using a Bio-Tek Instruments FL600 microplate spectrofluorometer. Inhibitor samples were diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 12.5% glycerol and dispensed into Nunc black polystyrene 384-well microtiter plates (VWR International, Leicestershire, UK) in a volume of 10 μl. ADAMTS-4 and FAM-AELQGRPISIAK-TAMRA peptide were diluted 50 mm BisTris propane (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Triton X-100, and 20 μl was added to the inhibitor plate such that their final assay concentrations were 200 pm and 0.5 μm, respectively. Peptide hydrolysis was measured for 4 h at 20 °C. Apparent Ki values were determined using the Robosage Version 7.31 add-in (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) for Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and the four-parameter logistic equation y = (A–D)/(1 + (x/CB) + D, where x is the concentration of the test sample, y is the percent inhibition, A is the minimum response, D is the maximum response, C is the apparent Ki (Ki(app) or IC50) for the curve, and B is the Hill slope. Mean values for Ki(app) were determined from a fit of the mean percentage inhibition values, at each concentration of inhibitor, to the four-parameter logistic equation. The S.E. of the curve fit (S.E. of the estimate) was determined from the average scatter of the points from the fitted curve using the Robosage Version 7.31 curve-fitting tool. For significance testing, individual paired values of Ki(app) were converted to pKi(app) (–log Ki(app)) and analyzed using the “t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means” analysis tool in Microsoft Excel. Kinetic analyses were performed with GraFit Version 5.0 software (Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK). The initial velocities (V) of substrate hydrolysis were determined at various substrate concentrations ([S]; 0–25 μm) and used to estimate the Michaelis (Km) and catalytic (kcat) constants by applying the equations V = Vmax[S]/([S] + Km) and kcat = Vmax/[E], where Vmax describes the estimated maximum velocity and [E] describes the enzyme concentration. In determining Km values, the effects of internal quench due to inner filter from the FRET peptide substrate on the kinetic rates determined were corrected for by calibration against a fluorescein-labeled peptide control (20Liu Y. Kati W. Chen C.M. Tripathi R. Molla A. Kohlbrenner W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Association and dissociation rate constants were determined by continuous monitoring of peptide cleavage by 400 pm ADAMTS-4 using GraFit Version 5.0 software. Initial velocities (V0) and steady-state velocities (Vs) of substrate hydrolysis were determined at various concentrations of TIMP-3 (0–40 nm) and used to estimate the association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants by applying the equations F = (Vst + (V0 – Vs))/((1 – e(–kobst))/kobs) + F0 and kobs = kon[I] + koff, where F is the observed fluorescence, F0 is the initial fluorescence, kobs is the observed rate constant, t is time, and [I] is the inhibitor concentration. Cleavage of the FAM-TAMRA Peptide by Recombinant ADAMTS-4 and Truncated Isoforms—The quenched fluorescent peptide FAM-AELQGRPISIAK-TAMRA was cleaved by recombinant ADAMTS-4 (TS4-1) at a single site to produce the fragments FAM-AE and LQGRPISIAK-TAMRA, confirming the glutamyl endopeptidase nature of this enzyme. In the presence of recombinant ADAMTS-4 (TS4-1), a 3-fold increase above the background fluorescent signal was observed over 240 min. The reaction curve was linear over time with the rate of peptide cleavage effectively constant. No peptide cleavage was observed in the absence of recombinant ADAMTS-4, and complete inhibition of the cleavage was achieved by the addition of the hydroxamate derivative matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor CGS27023 (100 μm; GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, UK) (12Hashimoto G. Aoki T. Nakamura H. Tanzawa K. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A pH optimum of 8.0 was determined for ADAMTS-4 in this assay (data not shown). Under our optimized conditions, kcat/Km values averaging 1 × 105 m–1 s–1 were measured (Table 1). The assay was highly sensitive, with peptide hydrolysis by as little as 50 pm ADAMTS-4 producing excellent z′ values (averaging 0.85), confirming that the assay was statistically highly reproducible (21Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5363) Google Scholar). TS4-5 was catalytically inactive, in agreement with previously published findings (9Kashiwagi M. Enghild J. Gendron C. Hughes C. Caterson B. Itoh Y. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10109-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the isoforms TS4-2*, -3, and -4 all demonstrated measurable rates of peptide hydrolysis at subnanomolar concentrations, and Km and kcat/Km values similar to those observed using the full-length ADAMTS-4 construct were observed (Table 1). In each case, complete inhibition of the cleavage was achieved by the addition of 100 μm CGS27023 (22MacPherson L.J. Bayburt E.K. Capparelli M.P. Carroll B.J. Goldstein R. Justice M.R. Zhu L. Hu S.

A Ki of 6.38 ± 1.51 nm was determined for TIMP-3. This compares with a published value of 7.9 nm using aggrecan as the substrate (12Hashimoto G. Aoki T. Nakamura H. Tanzawa K. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Little or no inhibition of TS4-1 was observed with TIMP-1 (Ki > 350 nm), and a Ki of 0.87 ± 0.16 μm was determined for CGS27023. Aggrecan Enhances TIMP-3 Potency—We investigated the effect of the potential physiological substrate aggrecan on the interaction between ADAMTS-4 and TIMP-3 using the FAM-TAMRA peptide assay. The addition of 10 μg/ml aggrecan to the assay in the absence of TIMP-3 resulted in an ∼50% inhibition of peptide hydrolysis due to competitive inhibition by the presence of an alternative substrate at a concentration close to its Michaelis constant (23Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. 1993; (, pp. , John & Wiley Ltd., West Susses, United Kingdom): 793-813Google Scholar). The Km and kcat values for ADAMTS-4 determined in the presence of 10 μg/ml aggrecan were also consistent with expectations for a purely competitive inhibition of the alternative substrate aggrecan with respect to peptide cleavage (Table 2). Interestingly, the presence of aggrecan resulted in an increase in the potency of TIMP-3, with an order of magnitude increase in potency observed at aggrecan concentrations >1 μg/ml (Fig. 3).TABLE 2Effects of aggrecan and chondroitin sulfate on ADAMTS-4 kcat and KmFull-length ADAMTS-4kcatKmADAMTS-4 inhibition (I0)s-1μm%Control1.0714.60Aggrecan1.1628.240.4Chondroitin sulfate1.4920.3-10.1 Open table in a new tab In contrast, CGS27023 inhibition was unaffected by the presence of 10 μg/ml aggrecan, with a Ki(app) of 1.23 ± 0.24 μm being measured. As before, no activity was measured for TIMP-1 under these assay conditions (Ki(app) > 350 nm). Association and dissociation constants for TIMP-3 inhibition of ADAMTS-4 were also determined in the presence and absence of aggrecan and demonstrated that the addition of aggrecan resulted in an increase in the observed kon, but had little effect on koff (Table 3).TABLE 3Effects of aggrecan on TIMP-3 association and dissociation ratesNo aggrecan10 μg/ml aggrecankon (s-1)9217 ± 2216462,857 ± 89,076koff (s-1)0.0006 ± 0.000050.0004 ± 0.0001 Open table in a new tab Enhancement of TIMP-3 Potency by Aggrecan Is Mediated through GAGs—Having ascertained that chondroitin sulfate did not significantly modify the Km and kcat values for ADAMTS-4 turnover of the FRET peptide (Table 2), we monitored its effect on TIMP-3 interactions with ADAMTS-4 using this assay. Whereas chondroitin 4-sulfate had little effect on Ki values, chondroitin 6-sulfate enhanced TIMP-3 binding to ADAMTS-4 at low doses (Fig. 4). Chondroitin 4-sulfate also had the effect of interfering significantly with the aggrecan potentiation of TIMP-3 inhibition, whereas chondroitin 6-sulfate had less effect. Keratan sulfate demonstrated no determinable effect on TIMP-3 inhibition of ADAMTS-4 in either the presence or absence of aggrecan (Fig. 5). The effects of deglycosylating aggrecan on its enhancement of TIMP-3 potency were also studied, and in line with the results obtained in studies of chondroitin sulfates, deglycosylated aggrecan was markedly less efficient in the modulation of TIMP-3 potency (Fig. 6).FIGURE 5Effects of aggrecan and keratan sulfate on TIMP-3 inhibition of ADAMTS-4.

Under normal assay conditions, all the forms gave similar binding constants with TIMP-3, although the TS4-4 construct containing the catalytic and disintegrin-like domains showed a small enhancement of affinity for TIMP-3 (Table 4). In the presence of aggrecan, only TS4-1 showed a substantial (20-fold) increase in TIMP-3 affinity. The data indicate that the His tag present in all the TS4 forms except TS4-2* had no effect on TIMP-3 or aggrecan interactions.TABLE 4Effects of ADAMTS-4 C-terminal domains on the interaction between ADAMTS-4, TIMP-3, and aggrecan[Aggrecan][NaCl]TS4-1TS4-2*TS4-3TS4-4Ki(app)S.E.Ki(app)S.E.Ki(app)S.E.Ki(app)S.E.mm0 μg/ml1006.381.515.723.756.171.443.630.2510 μg/ml1000.340.052.640.553.30.393.130.200 μg/ml00.800.110.680.1513.094.295.070.4710 μg/ml00.210.040.070.010.360.042.540.14 Open table in a new tab The Ionic Environment Modulates TIMP-3 Potency—To investigate whether the interactions observed between ADAMTS-4, aggrecan, chondroitin sulfate, and TIMP-3 could be electrostatic in nature, the experiments described above were repeated using assay buffer lacking NaCl. At low ionic strength, neither hydrolysis of the FAM-TAMRA peptide substrate nor the potency of CGS27023 inhibition was significantly changed (data not shown). In contrast, studies using TIMP-3 showed an 8-fold increase in potency. With the further addition of 10 μg/ml aggrecan, an overall 30-fold increase in TIMP-3 potency was observed (Table 4). TS4-2 interaction with TIMP-3 was dramatically enhanced under low ionic strength conditions: ∼10-fold in the absence of aggrecan and a further 10-fold in its presence. On the other hand, TIMP-3 interactions with ADAMTS-4 forms with further C-terminal truncations (TS4-3 and TS4-4) were not modified substantially by low ionic conditions. The addition of aggrecan resulted in a 20-fold increase in TS4-3 binding and had little effect on TS4-4 binding. The C-terminal extracatalytic domains of ADAMTS-4 are required for both binding to the extracellular matrix and substrate recognition, and in each case, this is mediated through GAG-binding interactions. The aggrecanase activity of ADAMTS-4 has been s"
https://openalex.org/W2134571058,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HRIs) are widely used to reduce serum cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Previous studies have shown that HRIs can induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the apoptosis-inducing effect of HRIs in greater detail. The HRI lovastatin induced apoptosis in the human colon cancer cell line SW480 by blocking the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Immunoblot analysis of antiapoptotic molecules, including survivin, XIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL, revealed that only survivin expression was decreased by lovastatin. Survivin down-regulation by RNA interference induced apoptosis, and survivin overexpression rendered the cells resistant to lovastatin-induced growth inhibition. These results indicate that survivin down-regulation contributes substantially to the proapoptotic properties of lovastatin. Farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, two downstream intermediates in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, simultaneously reversed survivin down-regulation and the blocking of Ras isoprenylation by lovastatin. Ras isoprenylation is important for the activation of Ras-mediated signaling, including the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt pathway. The PI3-kinase inhibitor down-regulated survivin in SW480 cells. In addition, lovastatin blocked Ras activation and Akt phosphorylation. We conclude that survivin down-regulation is crucial in lovastatin-induced apoptosis in cancer cells and that lovastatin decreases survivin expression by inhibiting Ras-mediated PI3-kinase activation via the blocking of Ras isoprenylation. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HRIs) are widely used to reduce serum cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

It has been reported that HRIs could induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells (5Agarwal B. Bhendwal S. Halmos B. Moss S.F. Ramey W.G. Holt P.R. Clin.

Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), two downstream intermediates in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, belong to a class of compounds named isoprenoids. They are bound to several cellular proteins, including small GTPases such as Ras, Rho, and Rac, by a post-translational modification known as isoprenylation. This process involves the addition of a 15-carbon farnesyl chain in FPP (farnesylation) or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl chain in GGPP (geranylgeranylation) to a cysteine sulfhydryl group near the carboxyl terminus. Isoprenylation of these proteins is crucial for membrane attachment (8Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4479) Google Scholar, 9Newman C.M. Magee A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 79-96PubMed Google Scholar) and the subsequent acquisition of biological activity (10Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). In particular, Ras proteins are important regulators of cell survival and proliferation (11Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 12Shaw R.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 2006; 441: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). Since FPP and GGPP are downstream of mevalonate in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, depletion of mevalonate by HRI reduces FPP and GGPP availability. Therefore, the growth-inhibitory effect of HRIs appears to be mediated by the inhibition of Ras isoprenylation. However, the dominant target in Ras-mediated signaling for HRI-induced growth inhibition has remained elusive. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, is expressed in embryonic and fetal organs but has not been identified in differentiated normal tissues, with the exception of the thymus, basal colonic epithelium, endothelial cells, and neural stem cells. Elevated survivin expression was observed in human cancers of various origins such as the breast (13Tanaka K. Iwamoto S. Gon G. Nohara T. Iwamoto M. Tanigawa N. Clin.

Since survivin overexpression desensitized cancer cells to several anticancer agents (24Tamm I. Wang Y. Sausville E. Scudiero D.A. Vigna N. Oltersdorf T. Reed J.C.

These results suggest that survivin promotes mitosis through aurora-B kinase activation and contributes to the aberrant growth of cancer cells. Recently, we reported that survivin enhances Fas ligand expression in colon cancer cells through the up-regulation of specificity protein-1 (Sp1)-mediated gene transcription. This indicates that survivin enables cancer cells to counterattack immune cells by inducing Fas ligand-triggered apoptosis in the cells of the immune surveillance system (29Asanuma K. Tsuji N. Endoh T. Yagihashi A. Watanabe N. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3922-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that survivin up-regulates human telomerase reverse transcriptase, a major determinant of telomerase activity, and maintains telomere length, indicating that survivin prolongs the cellular life span in cancer (30Endoh T. Tsuji N. Asanuma K. Yagihashi A. Watanabe N. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 300-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that survivin is a multifunctional protein that is important for the proliferation of cancer cells in vivo. Here, we show that the HRI lovastatin induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells and reduces survivin expression. Survivin overexpression desensitized the colon cancer cells to lovastatin. Additionally, survivin down-regulation was found to be linked to the prevention of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activation through the blocking of Ras isoprenylation. Taken together, these results suggest that survivin down-regulation may be essential for lovastatin-induced apoptosis. Materials—Lovastatin, mevalonate, FPP, GGPP, and squalene were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The anti-survivin, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-XL, anti-Akt, anti-phosphorylated Akt, and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-XIAP, anti-cIAP-1, and anti-cIAP-2 antibodies were obtained from R&D Systems (Mc-Kinley Place, NE). The PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 was sourced from Calbiochem. Tissue Samples—Colon cancer tissues as well as the adjacent normal colonic mucosa counterparts were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at Sapporo Medical University Hospital and Hokkaido Gastroenterology Hospital (Sapporo, Japan). Before the acquisition of these tissues, informed consent was obtained from the patients after explaining the investigational nature of the study. The samples were immediately frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. The tissues were also stained with hematoxylin/eosin (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and were reviewed by well experienced gastrointestinal pathologists. Cell Culture—The human colon cancer cell lines SW480, LS180, and HT-29 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma-Al-drich) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Measurement of Cell Viability—The viability of the colon cancer cells treated with lovastatin was assessed using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetra-zolium (MTS), an inner salt, by the Cell-Titer 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The amount of soluble formazan produced by viable cells as a result of MTS reduction was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using a microtiter plate reader (SpectraFluor, TECAN, Maennedorf, Switzerland). Drug sensitivities were expressed in terms of the IC50 values obtained from the dose-response curves; the values were obtained after fitting the data to the linear quadratic model and corresponded to 50% clonogenic inhibition of the viable-cell fraction. Detection of Apoptosis—Lovastatin-induced apoptosis was quantified by DNA content analysis. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic fluorochrome solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in darkness. A flow cytometer (EPICS XL-MCL cytometer, Beckman Coulter, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure 20,000 events per sample. Cells undergoing apoptosis were also quantified by combined staining with annexin V and propidium iodide using the MEB-CYTO apoptosis kit (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 5,000 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. All experiments were performed at least three times under each experimental condition. Immunoblot Analysis—Cytoplasmic proteins were extracted from the cells using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) with a protease inhibitor mixture (protease inhibitor cocktail; Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of the cytoplasmic proteins in Laemmli sample buffer were separated on a 4–20% gradient Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen) under denaturing conditions by using Tris-glycine sodium dodecyl sulfate running buffer (Invitrogen). The proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen) and detected using the WesternBreeze chemiluminescent immunodetection kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Band intensity was semiquantified using the PhotoShop Elements software after conversion to a digitized image using an image scanner (GT-9700F, EPSON, Tokyo, Japan). Quantification of Survivin and HMG-CoA mRNA—The expression of survivin and HMG-CoA mRNA was determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (29Asanuma K. Tsuji N. Endoh T. Yagihashi A. Watanabe N. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3922-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Endoh T. Tsuji N. Asanuma K. Yagihashi A. Watanabe N. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 300-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The gene-specific primers and fluorescent hybridization probes for survivin and HMG-CoA used in the quantitative RT-PCR were as follows. For survivin, the forward primer was 5′-AAG AAC TGG CCC TTC TTG GA-3′; the reverse primer was 5′-CAA CCG GAC GAA TGC TTT T-3′; and the probe was 5′-(FAM) CCA GAT GAC GAC CCC ATA GAG GAA CA (TAMRA)-3′. For HMG-CoA, the forward primer was 5′-GGC CCA GTT GTG CGT CTT C-3′; the reverse primer was 5′-CAC TGC GAA CCC TTC AGA TGT-3′; and the probe was 5′-(FAM) TCT GCA GAA GTG AAA GCC TGG CTC GA (TAMRA)-3′. Survivin-2B (retaining a part of intron 2 as a cryptic exon) and survivin-ΔEx3 (lacking exon 3), which are two splice variants of survivin, were not detected by this set of primers and probe (31Mahotka C. Wenzel M. Springer E. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6097-6102PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of these two types of mRNAs were normalized as ratios to the amounts of 18 S rRNA. PCR products were also confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Transfection of siRNA for Survivin into Colon Cancer Cells—A small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) was designed to target the coding region of the survivin gene (nucleotides 366–385, relative to the start codon). As the transfection control, we prepared scramble RNA containing the same number of each nucleotide as the siRNA targeting the survivin gene. The following siRNA duplexes were used in this study: survivin, 5′-GAA UUU GAG GAA ACU GCG A TT-3′ and 3′-TT CUU AAA CUC CUU UGA CGC U-5′; scramble RNA, 5′-GCA UUG GAU AAG ACG UAG A TT-3′ and 3′-TT CGU AAC CUA UUC UGC AUC U-5′. Transfections were performed using the Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection of Survivin Gene into Colon Cancer Cells—The plasmid encoding human survivin pcDNA3-Myc-survivin and the vector control pcDNA3-Myc were kindly provided by Dr. John C. Reed (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). Transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Geneticin-resistant clones were used in this study. Ras Activation Assays—SW480 cells were serum-starved for 48 h in the presence or absence of 20 μm lovastatin and treated with 10% FBS for 10 min. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Mg2+ lysis/wash buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% w/v Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovana-date, 10% w/v glycerol, and protease inhibitors). Activated Ras was identified using a Ras activation assay kit (Millipore Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, lysate containing 250 μg of protein was incubated at 4 °C with agarose-conjugated Raf1/Ras-binding domain for 30 min. Agarose beads were washed three times with Mg2+ lysis/wash buffer and then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoblotting was performed with the anti-Ras anti-body. To determine the amount of total Ras protein and isoprenylated Ras protein, whole-cell lysate was separated on a 6% Tris-glycine gel and a 4–20% gradient Tris-glycine gel, respectively. Lovastatin Induces Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cells—To investigate the growth-inhibitory effect of lovastatin on colon cancer cells, we cultured SW480, LS180, and HT-29 cells with various concentrations of lovastatin (5–20 μm) for up to 96 h and determined the viable cell number using the MTS assay (Fig. 1A). The growth of all three cell lines was inhibited by lovastatin in a dose-dependent manner, and the IC50 values of lovastatin for SW480, LS180, and HT-29 cells were 7.1, 25.3, and 46.8 μm, respectively. To determine whether the growth-inhibitory effect of lovastatin is mediated by the blocking of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, we performed add-back experiments using mevalonate, an intermediate in the cholesterol synthesis pathway (Fig. 1B). SW480 cells were cultured with 20 μm lovastatin and mevalonate at concentrations of 1–100 μm for 48 h. Mevalonate at concentrations greater than 50 μm reversed the lovastatin-induced growth inhibition. Previous studies demonstrated that lovastatin induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in colon cancer cells (5Agarwal B. Bhendwal S. Halmos B. Moss S.F. Ramey W.G. Holt P.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2223-2229PubMed Google Scholar, 6Agarwal B. Rao C.V. Bhendwal S. Ramey W.R. Shirin H. Reddy B.S. Holt P.R. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 838-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 7Wachtershauser, A., Akoglu, B., and Stein, J. Carcinogenesis, 22, 1061–1067Google Scholar). We then examined the effect of lovastatin on cell cycle progression. SW480 cells were treated with 20 μm lovastatin for 48 h, and the cell cycle status was assessed by DNA content analysis using flow cytometry (Fig. 1C). When compared with untreated cells, lovastatin-treated cells did not show any tendency toward an increased proportion of cells in the G0/G1, S, or G2/M phases of the cell cycle, indicating that lovastatin did not induce cell cycle arrest in SW480 cells. On the other hand, lovastatin markedly increased the hypodiploid DNA content, indicating SW480 cell apoptosis. This resulted in 20.7% more apoptosis in the lovastatin-treated cells than in the untreated cells, and 100 μm mevalonate antagonized the lovastatin-induced apoptosis. To confirm this observation, SW480 cells were treated with 20 μm lovastatin, and the proportion of apoptotic cells was determined using annexin V-propidium iodide staining, which is more sensitive for detecting apoptosis than detection based on the hypodiploid DNA content. As shown in Fig. 1D, 24.2% more annexin V-positive cells were observed among the lovastatin-treated cells than among the untreated cells, indicating that lovastatin induced apoptosis in SW480 cells. Lovastatin Down-regulates Survivin in Colon Cancer Cells—Many investigators showed that the expression of antiapoptotic molecules, including those from the Bcl-2 and IAP families, was elevated in cancer cells, and reduction in the expression of these proteins by gene-targeting techniques resulted in the induction of apoptosis. To identify the possible molecular mechanism underlying lovastatin-induced apoptosis, we examined the expression level of antiapoptotic proteins, including members of the IAP (survivin, XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2) and Bcl-2 (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) families, by immunoblot analysis in SW480 cells treated with 20 μm lovastatin. As shown in Fig. 2A, only survivin expression was attenuated by lovastatin; it decreased to undetectable levels at 48 h after treatment. In addition, mevalonate completely reversed the lovastatin-induced survivin down-regulation. Another possible mechanism underlying lovastatin-induced apoptosis is up-regulation of the proapoptotic molecule Bax. However, lovastatin did not affect Bax expression (data not shown). To clarify whether lovastatin-induced survivin down-regulation occurs at the transcriptional level, we used quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the survivin mRNA in SW480 cells treated with 20 μm lovastatin (Fig. 2B). Survivin mRNA expression in the lovastatin-treated cells was decreased by 60% when compared with that in the untreated cells at 48 h after treatment, and this effect was blocked by the addition of mevalonate. Down-regulation of Survivin Induces Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cells—To examine the contribution of survivin down-regulation to lovastatin-induced apoptosis, we introduced siRNA targeting the survivin gene (survivin siRNA) into SW480 cells. Fig. 3A shows survivin protein expression examined by immunoblot analysis in survivin siRNA-transfected cells. The introduction of survivin siRNA completely abrogated survivin protein expression at 3 days after transfection, and this reduction continued until 5 days after transfection. No reduction in survivin protein was observed in cells transfected with the scramble RNA, which contained an equal number of individual nucleotides as those in survivin siRNA. We then determined the viability of survivin siRNA-transfected cells at 5 days after transfection by using the MTS assay (Fig. 3B). When compared with untreated cells, the scramble RNA-transfected cells did not show a significant change in the viable cell number. However, the introduction of survivin siRNA decreased the viable cell number by 24%. In addition, DNA content analysis revealed that the hypodiploid DNA content had increased in the survivin siRNA transfectants, indicating that survivin down-regulation resulted in the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 3C). Survivin Up-regulation Protects Colon Cancer Cells from Lovastatin-induced Growth Inhibition—Next, we examined whether survivin up-regulation could confer protection against lovastatin-induced growth inhibition. We introduced the survivin gene expression vector pcDNA3-Myc-survivin into LS180 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the survivin gene transfectants expressed Myc-tagged survivin protein in addition to endogenous survivin protein. Lovastatin attenuated the expression of endogenous survivin in the survivin gene transfectants as well as in the parent LS180 cells and control vector transfectants (vector control). However, no remarkable change was observed in the expression level of the Myc-tagged survivin protein. Using the MTS assay, we determined the cell viability of the survivin gene transfectants treated with 10 or 20 μm lovastatin for 72 h (Fig. 4B). Survivin overexpression completely abrogated the growth-inhibitory effect of lovastatin, whereas the growth of the parent LS180 cells and control vector transfectants was inhibited by lovastatin in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that survivin down-regulation by lovastatin strongly contributes to its proapoptotic properties. FPP and GGPP Depletion by Lovastatin Contributes to Survivin Down-regulation—We next examined the effect of intermediates in the cholesterol synthesis pathway on lovastatin-induced survivin down-regulation. SW480 cells were incubated with 20 μm lovastatin for 48 h in the presence or absence of intermediates such as mevalonate, FPP, GGPP, and squalene. As shown in Fig. 5A, not only mevalonate but also FPP and GGPP reversed survivin down-regulation, whereas squalene did not. Since GGPP biosynthesis requires both FPP and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (another intermediate in the cholesterol synthesis pathway), the addition of only FPP could not produce GGPP. Therefore, FPP and GGPP depletion by lovastatin may contribute to survivin down-regulation individually. Mechanisms Underlying Lovastatin-induced Survivin Down-regulation Involve Inhibition of PI3-kinase Activation via Blocking of Ras Isoprenylation—Small GTPase Ras proteins (H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras) play a central role in cell survival and proliferation (11Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 12Shaw R.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 2006; 441: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). To play these roles, Ras proteins have to be localized to the plasma membranes where they are biologically active, and this localization is achieved by isoprenylation (8Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4479) Google Scholar, 9Newman C.M. Magee A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 79-96PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). To confirm that lovastatin inhibits Ras isoprenylation under the present experimental condition, we performed immunoblot analysis using anti-pan Ras antibodies that recognize H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras (Fig. 5B). In SW480 cells treated with 20 μm lovastatin for 48 h, the band intensity of the fast-migrating band that indicates isoprenylated Ras was decreased when compared with that in untreated cells. The addition of mevalonate, FPP, and GGPP reversed the inhibition of Ras isoprenylation by lovastatin, whereas squalene did not. Since the change in the amount of isoprenylated Ras correlated with that in survivin expression (Fig. 5, A and B), the inhibition of Ras isoprenylation may be linked to survivin down-regulation. Attempts were made to understand the relationship between Ras isoprenylation and survivin expression. Since activated Ras-mediated signaling involves the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway (11Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 12Shaw R.J. Cantley L.C.

Here, we asked whether OSM regulates apoptosis of normal or transformed (osteosarcoma) osteoblasts. We show that OSM sensitizes cells to apoptosis induced by various death inducers such as staurosporine, ultraviolet or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Apoptosis is mediated by the mitochondrial pathway, with release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and activation of caspases-9 and -3. DNA micro-arrays revealed that OSM modulates the expression of Bax, Bad, Bnip3, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Pharmacological inhibitors, dominant-negative signal transducer and activator of transcriptions (STATs), stable RNA interference and knockout cells indicated that the transcription factors p53 and STAT5, which are activated by OSM, are implicated in the sensitization to apoptosis, being responsible for Bax induction and Bcl-2 reduction, respectively. These results indicate that, in addition to growth arrest and induced differentiation, OSM also sensitizes normal and transformed osteoblasts to apoptosis by a mechanism implicating (i) activation and nuclear translocation of STAT5 and p53 and (ii) an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Therefore, association of OSM with kinase inhibitors such as Sts represents new therapeutic opportunities for wild-type p53 osteosarcoma."

We previously reported that association with the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) facilitates functional expression of the OR M71 at the plasma membrane of HEK-293 cells. In the present study, we examined the specificity of M71 interactions with other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). M71 was co-expressed in HEK-293 cells with 42 distinct GPCRs, and the vast majority of these receptors had no significant effect on M71 surface expression. However, co-expression with three subtypes of purinergic receptor (P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2AR) resulted in markedly enhanced plasma membrane localization of M71. Agonist stimulation of M71 co-expressed with P2Y1R and P2Y2R activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway via coupling of M71 to Gαo. We also examined the ability of β2-AR, P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2ARto interact with and regulate ORs beyond M71. We found that co-expression of β2-AR or the purinergic receptors enhanced the surface expression for an M71 subfamily member but not for several other ORs from different subfamilies. In addition, through chimeric receptor studies, we determined that the second transmembrane domain of β2-AR is necessary for β2-AR facilitation of M71 plasma membrane localization.

Although ORs were identified over a decade ago and are encoded by the most numerous multigene family in mammals, remarkably few OR-ligand pairs have been characterized (1Mombaerts P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 263-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 2Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar). Moreover, little is known about the signaling pathways activated by this diverse receptor family. Many ORs can signal through coupling to a specialized G protein, Gαolf, which results in adenylyl cyclase generation of cAMP and subsequent influx of positive ions through cyclic nucleotide gated channels to cause depolarization. However, considering the enormity of the OR repertoire (more than 1000 ORs in rodents and more than 350 in humans) and the variety of odors detected by mammals, it is probable that these receptors possess diverse signaling mechanisms. Indeed, there are numerous reports about the potential of ORs to signal through a variety of pathways (3Paysan J. Breer H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 441: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The major obstacle hindering the study of OR pharmacology and signaling has been difficulty expressing functional ORs in heterologous cells, primarily owing to their poor trafficking to the plasma membrane (4McClintock T.S. Landers T.M. Gimelbrant A.A. Fuller L.Z. Jackson B.A. Jayawickreme C.K. Lerner M.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 48: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Some studies performed in heterologous cells have overcome poor cell surface expression by using chimeric ORs or ORs tagged with the N-terminal targeting sequences from proteins such as rhodopsin or the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor (5Krautwurst D. Yau K-W. Reed R.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 6Wetzel C.H. Oles M. Wellerdieck C. Kuczkowiak M. Gisselmann G. Hatt H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7426-7433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One concern with these techniques is that such modifications may alter the true pharmacology of ORs (7Von Dannecker L.E. Mercadante A.F. Malnic B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9310-9314Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Alternatively, to circumvent improper localization in heterologous cells, adenoviral overexpression and gene targeting strategies in native OSNs have been used to successfully identify OR-ligand pairs and map axon convergence (8Touhara K. Sengoku S. Inaki K. Tsuboi A. Hirono J. Sato T. Sakano H. Haga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9Zhao H. Ivic L. Otaki J.M.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3033-3043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the successes achieved by the aforementioned studies, the vast majority of ORs remain orphans, and intracellular retention of ORs continues to impede progress in understanding the pharmacology of these specialized receptors. The molecular determinants underlying the impaired cell surface localization of ORs in heterologous cells is a topic of intense research interest. There is evidence that OR trafficking is dependent on the C-terminal domains of the receptors (11Gimelbrant A.A. Stoss T.D. Landers T.M. McClintock T.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Olfactory receptors may contain some type of endoplasmic reticulum retention signal or lack a forward targeting signal. In either of these cases, an accessory protein may be required to facilitate localization at the cell surface. Such an accessory protein may be absent in heterologous cells, leading to nonfunctional ORs trapped inside the cell. Evidence from the chemosensory systems of several species demonstrates the necessity for accessory proteins to properly localize ORs at the plasma membrane. Mutation of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein ODR-4, which has been proposed to aid in receptor folding, sorting, or transport, inhibits OR insertion into the plasma membrane (12Dwyer N. Troemel E. Sengupta P. Bargman C. Cell. 1998; 93: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Drosophila olfaction has been found to depend upon heterodimerization between conventional ORs and an atypical OR named OR83b, which is required for correct localization and functionality of fly ORs (13Larsson M.C. Domingos A.I. Jones W.D. Chiappe M.E. Amrein H. Vosshall L.B. Neuron. 2004; 43: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 14Benton R. Sachse S. Michnick S.W. Vosshall L.B. PLoS. Biol. 2006; 4: e20Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In mammals, proteins belonging to the receptor transporting protein family help translocate some ORs to the cell surface and enhance responses to odorants in HEK-293 cells (15Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H. Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). We previously found that association with the β2-adrenergic receptor (AR) results in enhanced surface expression and functionality of the OR M71 (16Hague C. Uberti M.A. Chen Z. Bush C.F. Jones S.V. Ressler K.J. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13672-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A natural question of interest following this finding was whether GPCRs other than β2-AR are capable of assembling with M71 to promote its surface expression and conversely whether ORs beyond M71 can undergo heterodimerization with nonolfactory GPCRs to enhance their trafficking to the cell surface. In the present study, we screened 42 distinct nonolfactory GPCRs and identified several purinergic receptor subtypes that also interact with M71 and facilitate plasma membrane localization of this OR. We furthermore found that stimulation of M71 associated with the purinergic subtypes P2Y1R and P2Y2R can activate Gαo, thereby coupling this OR to a signaling pathway distinct from Gαolf. We also examined the capacity of ORs besides M71 to interact with other GPCRs and found that an M71 subfamily member, but not ORs from different OR subfamilies, exhibited enhanced cell surface expression upon co-expression with β2-AR and the purinergic receptors. Finally, using receptor chimeras, we identified the second transmembrane domain of the β2-AR as a required region for β2-AR-mediated enhancement of M71 plasma membrane localization. Receptor Constructs—The FLAG-M71-GFP construct, WT-M71 construct, and α1A-, α1B-, and α1D-AR constructs were generated as previously described (16Hague C. Uberti M.A. Chen Z. Bush C.F. Jones S.V.

The trace amine-associated receptor 2 construct was kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Jones (Synaptic Pharmaceutical Corp.). Cell Culture and Transfection—All of the tissue culture media and related reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. HEK-293 cells were maintained in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 80-95% confluent cells in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were transfected with 1-3 μg of cDNA mixed with 15 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 5 ml of serum-free medium. Following overnight incubation, complete medium was added, and the cells were trypsinized and replated. For confocal microscopy experiments, a high transfection efficiency was achieved through electroporation using the Nucleofector® following the manufacturer's protocol (Amaxa). Briefly, HEK-293 cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in Nucleofector solution along with 0.7 μg of cDNA/construct. This suspension was then subjected to electroporation in the Nucleofector®, followed by the addition of complete medium and plating of cells directly onto tissue culture treated glass slides (BD Biosciences). The cells were grown for 24 h. Western Blotting—The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4-20% Tris-Glycine gels, followed by transfer of protein to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (2% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibody for either 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Next, the membranes were washed three times in blocking buffer and incubated with either a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) secondary antibody or a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature, followed by three blocking buffer washes. Proteins bound by HRP-conjugated secondaries were visualized via enzyme-linked chemiluminescence using ECL reagent (Pierce). Proteins bound by fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody were detected using the Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor). Surface Luminometer Assay—HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with ORs alone or co-transfected with ORs plus other GPCR subtypes were split into poly d-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes and grown overnight at 37 °C. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed with PBS again. The cells were then incubated in blocking buffer (2% nonfat milk in PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated M2-anti-FLAG antibody (1:600; Sigma) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with blocking buffer, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated with SuperSignal Pico ECL reagent (Pierce) for 15 s. Luminescence of the entire 35-mm dish was determined using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). The mean values ± S.E. were calculated as percentages of absorbance in arbitrary units and were normalized to total protein in experiments where different cell densities were a factor.

At 1 h post-fixation, the tissue was decalcified at 4 °C in 250 mm EDTA for 1 week. After freezing in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek OCT), the tissue was sectioned at 25 μm using a Leica cryostat, and sections were adhered to Superfrost Plus slides (VWR). The sections were blocked for 3 h in blocking buffer (10% normal donkey serum, 0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4) followed by overnight incubation at room temperature with anti-β-galactosidase (1:300; Promega) plus either anti-P2Y1R, P2Y2R, (both 1:25; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or A2AR (1:25; Chemicon) primary antibodies in PBS plus 2.5% normal donkey serum. After three 10-min washes in wash buffer (PBS plus 0.1% Triton-X-100), the sections were incubated with anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated and anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibodies in PBS plus 2.5% normal donkey serum for 1 h. The sections were washed three times for 10 min each in wash buffer and then DAPI-stained, followed by two brief water rinses. The slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs) and analyzed on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Confocal Microscopy Analysis of Transfected Cells—Nucleofected cells grown on glass slides were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed for 5 min three times with PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized and blocked by incubating in blocking buffer (1× PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.04% saponin, pH 7.4) for 1 h. Next, the cells were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000; Sigma) plus either rat anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (1:1000; Roche), or rabbit anti-P2Y2R antibody (1:300; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three 5-min washes with blocking buffer, the cells were incubated for 30 min with anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody plus either anti-rat Alexa-Fluor 546-conjugated or anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibody (1:250; Molecular Probes). The cells were washed in blocking buffer three times for 5 min, DAPI-stained, rinsed twice with water, dehydrated through ethanol, and mounted with Vectashield. A Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope was used to examine cells. Co-immunoprecipitation—Transfected cells were harvested in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA) and rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 30 min to solubilize. Unsolubilized membranes were pelleted through centrifugation. 100 μl of the supernatant was reserved to verify construct expression, and 20 μl of 6× sample buffer was added. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 60 μl of anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads rotating at 4 °C. Following at least 4 h of incubation, the beads were pelleted and washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Next, 150 μl of 2× sample buffer was added to elute the proteins. 20 μl of lysate and immunoprecipitated samples were loaded onto gels and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. ERK Activation Assays—Transfected HEK-293 cells grown in 35-mm dishes were starved in serum-free minimum essential medium overnight. For pertussis toxin (PTX) pretreatment, 10 ng/ml PTX was added to the medium 24 h before the experiment. To stimulate cells, 100 μm acetophenone (Fluka, stock solution prepared in ethanol and diluted to working concentration in water) was added directly to the starvation medium for 2 min at 37 °C. At the end of the stimulation, the medium was removed, and 80 μl of sample buffer was added. The samples were sonicated, heated to 85 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged briefly at 17,000 × g. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, as described above, and extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) was visualized using monoclonal anti-phospho p42/44 and rabbit anti-p42/44 antibodies (1:1000; Cell Signaling) to blot for phosphorylated and total mitogen-activated ERK 1/2, respectively. Fluorescence-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary signals (1:10,000; Rockland) were detected using the Odyssey imaging system, and band densities were quantified using Odyssey imaging software (Li-Cor). Enhanced Plasma Membrane Localization of the OR M71 upon Co-expression with the Purinergic Receptors P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2AR—We have previously reported that association of the OR M71 with the β2-AR alleviates intracellular retention and yields functional M71 localized at the plasma membrane (16Hague C.

M71 tagged at the N terminus with FLAG and at the C terminus with GFP (FLAG-M71-GFP) was expressed alone and in combination with each of the other GPCRs by transient transfection in HEK-293 cells. Plasma membrane levels of M71 were quantified by detection with an anti-FLAG HRP-conjugated antibody in unpermeabilized cells via a luminometer assay. When expressed alone, only a small amount of M71 was detected at the plasma membrane. Co-expression with the vast majority of receptors examined had no significant effect on M71 surface expression. Strikingly, however, three purinergic receptor subtypes, P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2AR, significantly increased M71 plasma membrane expression by 4-8-fold, comparable with the previously reported effect of co-expression with β2-AR (Fig. 1). Expression of P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2AR in M71-positive Olfactory Sensory Neurons—We performed immunohistochemistry on cryostat sections of olfactory epithelial tissue to elucidate whether P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2AR are expressed in M71-positive OSNs. To circumvent the lack of an M71-specific antibody, we utilized M71-lacZ transgenic mice for our studies. These mice express the β-galactosidase gene under control of the M71 promoter such that all cells expressing M71 also express β-galactosidase (19Vassalli A. Rothman A. Feinstein P. Zapotocky M. Mombaerts P. Neuron. 2002; 35: 681-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, by labeling sections with an anti-β-galactosidase primary antibody, we identified M71-positive OSNs distributed in the dorso-medial zone of the nasal epithelium, as previously described (19Vassalli A. Rothman A. Feinstein P. Zapotocky M. Mombaerts P. Neuron. 2002; 35: 681-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 33Mombaerts P. Wang F. Dulac C. Chao S.K. Nemes A. Mendelsohn M. Edmondson J. Axel R. Cell. 1996; 87: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Using antibodies specific for P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2AR, we found each of the purinergic receptors to be expressed in olfactory epithelial tissue (Fig. 2). The expression of all three receptors appeared to be ubiquitous throughout the epithelial layer and not restricted to any one population of cells. Both the P2Y1R and P2Y2R showed particularly intense expression on the luminal edge of the olfactory epithelium, where OSN cilia extend and ORs are expressed (Fig. 2, Field View). High magnification images showed direct overlap (yellow) of the purinergic receptors expression with M71-positive OSNs (Fig. 2, Zoom), and all M71-positive OSNs observed exhibited co-staining with the purinergic receptors. Tissue labeled without purinergic receptor primary antibody exhibited a low level of auto-fluorescence. Control experiments in sections from P2Y1R-KO and P2Y2R-KO mice showed auto-fluorescence levels similar to those of M71-lacZ sections without primary antibody, suggesting that the labeling observed with the purinergic receptor antibodies was specific. Physical Association of M71 with P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2AR—The observed enhancement of the plasma membrane localization of M71 upon co-expression with P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2AR receptors, together with confirmation that these purinergic receptors are expressed with M71 in native tissue, suggested that M71 might physically interact with each of these GPCRs. Thus, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed to determine whether M71 can associate in physical complexes with P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2AR. FLAG-M71-GFP was expressed together with each of the purinergic receptors, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads. Equal levels of expression were observed for M71 transfected alone or co-transfected with the purinergic receptors, and levels of M71 immunoprecipitated were also similar with each of the co-transfected purinergic receptor (data not shown). FLAG-M71-GFP expression was detected as a unique band slightly higher than the 37-kDa protein marker in lysate and immunoprecipitated samples (Fig. 3A). Immunoprecipitation of M71 from cells co-expressing HA-P2Y1R yielded a dense immunoreactive band upon blotting with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3B). In addition, both P2Y2R and HA-A2AR were also robustly co-immunoprecipitated with M71 (Fig. 3, C and D). Conversely, a GPCR that does not enhance the cell surface expression of M71, the δ opioid receptor, was not found to co-immunoprecipitate with M71 (Fig. 3E). These data demonstrate the ability of M71 to form stable complexes with specific purinergic receptors in a cellular context. To further verify the cellular localization of M71, we studied transfected HEK-293 cells via confocal microscopy. P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2AR effectively trafficked to the plasma membrane when expressed alone in HEK cells (data not shown). FLAG-M71, however, exhibited a diffuse staining throughout the entirety of the cytoplasm when expressed alone (Fig. 4A). Conversely, upon co-transfection with HA-P2Y1R, P2Y2R, or HA-A2AR, a significant amount of M71 localized to the plasma membrane where it co-localized well with the various purinergic receptors (Fig. 4, B-D). These data suggest that the purinergic receptors P2Y1R, P2Y2R, and A2AR are able to interact in a physical complex with M71 that facilitates loc"

To identify the regions of the Rheb surface most critical for signaling to TOR complex 1, we created a set of 26 mutants wherein clusters of 1-5 putative solvent-exposed residues were changed to alanine, ultimately changing 65 residues distributed over the entire Rheb surface. The signaling function of these mutants was assessed by their ability, in comparison to wild type Rheb, to restore the phosphorylation of S6K1(Thr389) when expressed transiently in amino acid-deprived 293T cells. The major finding is that two mutants situated in the Rheb switch 2 segment, Y67A/I69A and I76A/D77A, exhibit a near total loss of function, whereas extensive replacement of the switch 1 segment and other surface residues with alanines causes relatively little disturbance of Rheb rescue of S6K1 from amino acid withdrawal. This is surprising in view of the minimal impact of guanyl nucleotide on Rheb switch 2 configuration. The loss of function Rheb switch 2 mutants are well expressed and exhibit partial agonist function in amino acid-replete cells. They are unimpaired in their ability to bind GTP or mammalian (m)TOR in vivo or in vitro, and the mTOR polypeptides retrieved with these inactive Rheb mutants exhibit kinase activity in vitro comparable with mTOR bound to wild type Rheb.

We conclude that Rheb signaling to mTOR in vivo requires a Rheb switch 2-dependent interaction with an element other than the three known polypeptide components of TOR complex 1. Rheb is a small GTPase in the Ras branch of the small GTPase superfamily (1Colicelli J. Sci. STKE 2004,. 2004; 250: RE13Google Scholar), first identified as an mRNA whose abundance in rat brain increased rapidly after seizure induction and maneuvers that elicit long term potentiation (2Yamagata K.

Rheb mRNA abundance in cultured mammalian cells is up-regulated by serum, growth factors, and UV irradiation. Two Rheb polypeptides, ∼50% identical in amino acid sequence, are present in mammals, and Rheb polypeptides, ∼40-50% identical in amino acid sequence to those in mammals, are present in several single cell eukaryotes, including Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Aspuria P.J. Tamanoi F. Cell. Signal. 2004; 10: 1105-1112Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A major physiologic function of Rheb was uncovered through screens in Drosophila for genes that affect cell size (4Oldham S. Hafen E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 2: 79-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Previous studies had shown that loss of function mutations of the genes encoding the subunits of the tuberous sclerosis complex polypeptides, TSC1 or TSC2, resulted in enlarged cells and constitutive activation of signaling through the rapamycin-sensitive TOR 3The abbreviations used are: TOR, target of rapamycin; mTOR, mammalian TOR; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; D-PBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, short interfering RNA; WT, wild type; GMPPNP, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. pathway (5Gao X.

Mutational inactivation of Rheb was found to produce cells of small size, even in the absence of TSC function; reciprocally, overexpression of Rheb greatly increased cell size and stimulated TOR signaling in a rapamycin-sensitive manner (8Patel P.H.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The ability of Rheb inactivation to reverse the large size phenotype of TSC deficiency suggested that Rheb acted down-stream of the TSC and was perhaps the dominant effector of TSC on cell size. A satisfactory biochemical explanation for the genetic interactions observed between TSC and Rheb was provided by the finding that the TSC1/2 heterodimer is a GTPase activator for Rheb (11Castro A.F.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), and Rheb is nearly completely GTP-charged in vivo in the absence of TSC. To explore the mechanism by which Rheb promotes TOR signaling, we utilized an in vivo assay of Rheb activation of TOR signaling based on the ability of overexpressed recombinant Rheb to stimulate the rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389/412 in cells deprived of amino acids (13Long X.Y. Lin O rtiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 14Long X.S. Ortiz-Vega S. Lin Y. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23433-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Withdrawal of amino acids or leucine alone causes a time-dependent dephosphorylation of S6K1(Thr389/412) (15Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is catalyzed directly by TOR complex 1 (16Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and requires the binding of wild type S6K1 to the TORC1 polypeptide raptor. In leucine-depleted cells S6K1(Thr389) phosphorylation is unresponsive to insulin, but can be restored by readdition of leucine or, in the absence of leucine, by overexpression of wild type Rheb (13Long X.Y. Lin O rtiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 14Long X.S. Ortiz-Vega S. Lin Y. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23433-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Rheb switch 1 domain (e.g. T38M, I39K, and N41A) reduce or eliminate Rheb rescue of S6K1 phosphorylation, as do the Rheb mutations S20N or D60I, which eliminate the ability of Rheb to bind guanyl nucleotides. The ability of overexpressed wild type Rheb to restore TORC1 signaling appears to require the direct binding of Rheb-GTP to the TORC1 complex. Overexpressed wild type and mutant nucleotide-deficient Rhebs can each bind directly to TORC1; however, whereas the mTOR polypeptides bound to wild type Rheb exhibit kinase activity assayed in vitro, and mTOR polypeptides bound to the nucleotide-deficient Rheb mutants (that fail to restore S6K1 phosphorylation in amino acid-deficient cells) are entirely devoid of kinase activity in vitro (13Long X.Y. Lin O rtiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The importance of the direct binding of Rheb to TOR for TOR signaling is supported by the finding that some (I39K and N41A) but not all (T38M) Rheb loss of function Rheb switch 1 mutants show diminished retrieval of endogenous mTOR (13Long X.Y. Lin O rtiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 18Tee A.R. Blenis J. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4763-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); conversely, a mutant of S. pombe Rheb (K120R) selected for enhanced signaling in vivo exhibits a parallel enhancement of its association with endogenous SpTOR (19Urano J. Comiso M.J. Guo L. Aspuria P.-J. Denskin R. Tabancay Jr., A.P. Kato-Stankiewicz J. Tamanoi F. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1074-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The binding of recombinant Rheb to endogenous and recombinant TOR exhibited several unexpected features. Most surprisingly, the association of Rheb with mTOR did not require Rheb guanyl nucleotide charging and was not enhanced (and was perhaps decreased) by charging with GTP rather than GDP (13Long X.Y. Lin O rtiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). This behavior, essentially unique for the interaction of a Ras-like GTPase with a putative effector, was evident both during transient expression and in direct binding in vitro of the purified polypeptides. The binding of Rheb to mTOR was localized to mTOR-(2148-2300), which corresponds to the amino-terminal lobe of the mTOR catalytic domain. Surprisingly, Rheb was observed to also bind, in vivo and in vitro, to LST8 and to the carboxyl-terminal segment of raptor (13Long X.Y. Lin O rtiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, whereas the binding of Rheb to full-length mTOR, as well as the mTOR carboxyl-terminal fragment 2148-2549, is inhibited by withdrawal of the amino acid leucine, Rheb binding to LST8 or raptor is unaffected (14Long X.S. Ortiz-Vega S. Lin Y. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23433-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiologic relevance of Rheb binding to the latter two TORC1 components is uncertain, especially as those polypeptides are both seven-bladed WD domain propellers, and their proper folding during transient expression is not assured. A structure of the Rheb polypeptide bound to GTP and GDP was described recently by Yu et al. (20Yu Y. Li S. Xu X. Li Y. Guan K. Arnold E. Ding J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17093-17100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The overall Rheb structures are most closely related to those of Ras and Rap1, and like those polypeptides, the Rheb switch 1 segment (amino acids 33-41) shows a large change in configuration between the GTP/GMPPNP-liganded state and the GDP-liganded polypeptide. This is consistent with the likely participation of the Rheb switch 1 segment in the GTP-dependent signaling function of Rheb, a conclusion supported by the finding that the Rheb switch 1 mutants T38A and I39K are greatly impaired in their ability to restore S6K1(Thr389/412) phosphorylation in amino acid-deprived cells. Yu et al. (20Yu Y. Li S. Xu X. Li Y. Guan K. Arnold E. Ding J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17093-17100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) also detected two significant differences between the structures of Rheb and Ras, one involving the residues in Rheb homologous to those in Ras concerned with GTP hydrolysis, and a second related to the structure of the switch 2 segment and the dependence of its conformation on the binding of GTP versus GDP. Whereas the Ras switch 2 contains a 10-11-residue α-helix, the Rheb switch 2 segment is primarily an extended loop that contains a very short helical stretch (amino acids 72-74) and is positioned differently in relation to the core structure as compared with the Ras switch 2. Moreover, whereas the Ras switch 2 segment exhibits a strong GTP-dependent reconfiguration, the Rheb switch 2 is only slightly reconfigured; the Rheb switch 2 loop amino-terminal to the short helix is relatively unaffected, whereas the short helix shows a modest displacement comparing the GTP- and GDP-liganded polypeptides. The availability of the Rheb structures enabled us to undertake a systematic mutagenesis of the residues on the Rheb surface, so as to inquire whether regions of Rheb apart from the switch 1 loop are important to the ability of Rheb to signal downstream to TORC1. The present results identify a set of amino acids in the Rheb switch 2 segment that exert a profound effect on the ability of Rheb to rescue S6K1 phosphorylation in amino acid-deprived cells. Reagents—The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. pEBG-p70S6k, pCMV5-FLAG-mTOR-(2148-2549), pCMV5-FLAG-LST8, and pcDNA1-FLAG-raptor-(1009-1335) were described previously (13Long X.Y. Lin O rtiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma, and anti-p70S6K(phospho-Thr389) was from Cell Signaling; anti-GST anti-body was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and the GSH-Sepharose from GE Healthcare. GDP, GTP, and GTPγS were from Sigma. [32P]Orthophosphate was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. D-PBS was from Invitrogen. Generation of Rheb Mutants—Plasmids encoding all mutant versions of Rheb were generated with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Primers were designed to contain the desired mutations, and the mutagenesis was performed following the manufacturer's instruction. Each mutant was constructed in both the pCMV5-FLAG and pEBG vectors. All mutants were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection was performed by the lipofection method with Lipofectamine following the manufacturers' instructions. Amino acid withdrawal procedures were described as before (14Long X.S. Ortiz-Vega S. Lin Y. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23433-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In the experiments employing RNA interference to knock-down endogenous Rheb in HeLa cells (Fig. 3B), control siRNA or Rheb siRNA was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000. The Rheb siRNA (sequence UCAGUGUAGUUUGUUGUUUAA) targets Rheb 3′-untranslated region; the control siRNA is CACAACUCGCGUGCCGAGUUCAUAA. One day after siRNA transfection, cells were transfected with pCMV5-FLAG vector or pCMV5-FLAG-Rheb WT or mutants. Cells were harvested and analyzed by immunoblot 48 h after plasmid transfection. Assays of Rheb Function—The assay of the ability of Rheb to signal to TOR complex 1 in vivo involved transient coexpression of FLAG-tagged wild type- or mutant-Rheb with an S6K1 reporter in 293T cells. Two hours prior to harvest, the medium was replaced with D-PBS. Extracts were prepared as in Ref. 13Long X.Y. Lin O rtiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar and subjected to immunoblot for Rheb, S6K1 polypeptide, and S6K1(Thr(P)389). The dose of wild type Rheb chosen was 0.5 μg of DNA, which restores S6K1(Thr(P)389) to 50-70% of maximum. For assays of Rheb guanyl nucleotide binding in vitro, Rheb wild type and mutant polypeptides were transiently expressed as GST fusion proteins in HEK293T cells. Cells were extracted in ice-cold buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and aprotinin (10 mg/ml)), cleared by centrifugation, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with GSH-Sepharose beads. Adsorbed proteins were washed three times in extraction buffer and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8. Guanine nucleotide binding was determined as described previously (21Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GST fusion Rheb (1.5 μg) was incubated at 30 °C in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 μm [35S]GTPγS, or [3H]GDP (each at 2 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences)). At the times indicated, ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added, and the samples were rapidly filtered through nitrocellulose filters and washed twice with this buffer. The amount of bound guanine nucleotide was measured by scintillation counting. Rheb guanyl nucleotide binding in vivo, protein-protein interactions during transient expression or in vitro, and the assays of mTOR kinase bound to recombinant GST-Rheb were performed as described in Ref. 13Long X.Y.

Generation of Rheb Mutants That Collectively Change All Surface Residues to Alanines—Based on the assumption that surface-exposed amino acid side chains are critical for the interaction of Rheb with its effectors, we undertook to change clusters of solvent-exposed side chains to methyl groups through mutation of contiguous surface residues to alanine. We inferred that the loss of function caused by mutation of residues in the switch I region (by homology, Rheb residues 31-43; see Refs. 13Long X.Y. Lin O rtiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr.

Moreover, we assumed that the residue side chains most highly exposed to solvent in the fully folded Rheb structure were likely to be less critical for proper Rheb folding as compared with buried residues. To identify Rheb residues appropriate for mutation, we examined the recently published human Rheb structure (complexed with either GTP or GDP) (20Yu Y. Li S. Xu X. Li Y. Guan K. Arnold E. Ding J. J.

The function “accessible amino acids” identifies residues based on their solvent accessibility relative to the solvent accessibility of residue X in an extended pentapeptide GGXGG, whose solvent-accessible surface is set at 100%. Thus at an accessibility setting of 100%, none of the amino acids in the Rheb-GTP structure are considered to have a surface whose solvent accessibility is equal to the solvent accessibility of residue X.To identify probable Rheb surface residues, we therefore reduced the percent of surface accessibility required relative to residue X until the DeepView program identified most of the Rheb switch 1 residues as solvent-accessible; at an accessibility setting of 54%, Ile39 was the first Rheb switch 1 residue to be designated as solvent-accessible, and Asp36 and Gln30 became “accessible” at a setting of 44%. The switch 1 residue Asn41, whose mutation to alanine was shown previously to result in a partial loss of signaling to TOR complex 1 (13Long X.Y. Lin O rtiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4763-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), became solvent-accessible at a setting of 27%. We therefore chose a level of 25% of surface accessibility relative to residue X; at this setting, Rheb amino acids 33-37 and 39-42 are considered by the DeepView program to be solvent-exposed in the Rheb-GTP structure. Overall, 58 of the first 172 Rheb amino acids are solvent-exposed in Rheb-GTP, among which 50 are also exposed in the Rheb-GDP structure; of the eight residues solvent-exposed exclusively in Rheb-GTP, four are in the switch 1 segment. In addition, seven other residues are solvent-accessible only in Rheb-GDP (Fig. 1). The 58 putative solvent-exposed residues in Rheb-GTP were clustered and collectively changed to alanines through a total of 20 mutants that each change 1-5 amino acids (Table 1, class I). As regards the residues that are solvent-exposed only in Rheb-GDP, Ser16, Thr38, Glu53, and Ser75 were individually changed to alanines; Ser4 was converted to alanine together with the constitutive surface residues Gln3 and Ser6, and Arg162 and Leu165 were converted to alanine together with the buried residues Ile163/164 (Table 1, class II). All mutants were constructed based on two plasmids, pCMV5-FLAG-Rheb and pEBG-Rheb, allowing for expression of FLAG- or GST-tagged Rheb in mammalian cells, respectively. An alignment of human Rheb1 and Rheb2 and the residues that were mutated in Rheb1 are shown in Fig. 1. All Rheb mutants are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Rheb1 mutants generated in this studyClass IClass IIClass IIIArg15Y67I69H124M125E126V128Q3S4S6V17AE28Q30Q72I73Y131E132E133K135Ser16V17GD33S34Y35D36P37I76D77E139S140N142Thr38S21GI39E40N41T42I90K91K151E152Glu53S211T44L46E94K97Q154D158R161Ser75K120RT48N50G51L104D105M106K169M170D171R161R162I163I164N153SH55Q57K109V110Q111N153T Open table in a new tab Of the 26 mutants, only the E94A/K97A mutant is poorly expressed after transient transfection in 293 cells. Further analysis showed that E94A or K97A individually has no effect on Rheb expression or S6K1 rescue; however, changing the Glu94 and Lys97 residues simultaneously (to Ala or Met) appears to have structural consequences that lead to low expression, presumably because of misfolding (data not shown). This mutant is excluded from further analysis. The other 25 mutants are well expressed (Fig. 2A). Identification of Partial and Severe Loss-of-Function Rheb Mutants—Withdrawal of extracellular amino acids from 293 cells for 90-120 min leads to complete but reversible dephosphorylation of S6K1(Thr389/412) (15Hara K.

Transient overexpression of wild type Rheb can, in a dose-dependent and rapamycinsensitive manner, restore S6K1(Thr389) phosphorylation in amino acid-deprived cells, indicating that Rheb achieves this rescue through TORC1 (14Long X.S. Ortiz-Vega S. Lin Y. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23433-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We therefore utilized this response to Rheb to assess the ability of the Rheb alanine mutants to signal to TORC1 in vivo. Inasmuch as we sought to identify strong loss of function mutants, a dose of wild type Rheb capable of ∼50-70% of the maximal S6K1(Thr389) phosphorylation (14Long X.S. Ortiz-Vega S. Lin Y. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23433-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) was chosen for the comparison. As illustrated by Fig. 2A, the comparison of the mutants to wild type Rheb was carried out only in experiments where the expression of the mutant Rhebs was equal or only slightly (i.e. less than 2-fold) greater than that of wild type Rheb, with the exception of the E94A/K97A mutant described above. The results of a series of three or more such comparisons are summarized in Fig. 2B; essentially, the vast majority of the Rheb alanine mutants are functionally “normal” in this assay, i.e. their ability to rescue S6K1(Thr389) phosphorylation from amino acid withdrawal is within 2 standard deviations of that exhibited by comparable expression of a half-maximal dose of wild type Rheb (whose effect is set arbitrarily in Fig. 2B to 100%). Two mutants, Y67A/I69A and I76A/D77A, show a severe defect, essentially a complete inability to rescue S6K1 from amino acid withdrawal. These inactivating mutations are located in the switch 2 region, flanking the short helix, amino acids 72-74. The surface residue mutants Q72/T73A and S75A are normal in their ability to restore S6K1(Thr(P)389), whereas the mutant Q72A/Y74A (not shown), which changes both a surface residue (Gln72) and an adjacent, solvent-inaccessible residue (Tyr74), is completely unable to rescue S6K1(Thr(P)389) despite robust expression. When examined in amino acid-replete 293 cells, the Rheb(Y67A/I69A) and (I76A/D77A) mutants coexpressed with S6K1 do exhibit an ability to stimulate S6K1(Thr389) phosphorylation, with an efficacy approximately half that of wild type Rheb (Fig. 3A). Thus, these switch 2 mutants do not act in a dominant interfering manner but exhibit a reduced potency that is exaggerated by amino acid depletion. This contrasts with the inactive, nucleotide-deficient Rheb1 mutants S20N and D60I, which cause a modest inhibition of S6K1(Thr389) phosphorylation in replete medium (13Long X.Y. Lin O rtiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 23Tabancay Jr., A.P. Gau C.L. Machado I.M. Uhlmann E.J. Gutmann D.H. Guo L. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39921-39930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To examine the responses to lower levels of recombinant Rheb in nutrient-replete cells, we reduced endogenous Rheb1 in replete HeLa cells using RNA oligonucleotides directed against Rheb1 3′-un-translated sequences; this results in a substantial reduction in endogenous Rheb1 polypeptide and a partial reduction in the phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 on Thr389 (Fig. 3B, compare lane 1 with lane 2). On this background, modest overexpression of recombinant, wild type Rheb1 is sufficient to restore S6K1(Thr(P)389) to control levels (Fig. 3B, compare lane 4 to lane 1), whereas comparable overexpression of Rheb1 Y67A/I69A and I76A/D77A yields little or no restoration of S6K1(Thr(P)389) (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 6 with lane 4). Nevertheless, a higher level of Rheb1 Y67A/I69A expression does significantly restore S6K1(Thr(P)389) (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 5 and 3 with lane 1). Thus, although the ability of these Rheb switch 2 mutants to activate mTORC1 signaling is greatly reduced in amino acid-deprived cells (Fig. 2), they clearly exhibit partial agonist activity in nutrient-replete cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The reduced efficacy of these mutants in amino acid-deficient cells is likely due in part to the ability of amino acid depletion to reduce the interaction between Rheb and mTOR (14Long X.S. Ortiz-Vega S. Lin Y. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23433-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), an effect that is also observed with these switch 2 mutants (data not shown). The Rheb1 mutant E28A/N30A shows a partial (∼50%) loss of function that is statistically distinguishable from the response to wild type. E28A/N30A, located immediately amino-terminal to the switch I region, corresponds to nucleotide-invariant residues in Ras whose mutation impairs the transforming activity of Ras (24Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Surprisingly however, two mutants that directly alter the Rheb switch I domain, Asp33-Ser34-Tyr35-Asp36-Pro37-Ala4, and Ile39-Glu40-Asn41-Thr42-Ala4, show no loss or only slight loss in their ability to rescue S6K1 from amino acid withdrawal-induced dephosphorylation. This is in contrast to the previous finding that t"

Archease genes are generally located adjacent to genes encoding proteins involved in DNA or RNA processing.

Here we report the function of one of these archeases from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus abyssi.

In vitro, the purified recombinant methyltransferase catalyzes m5C formation at several cytosines within tRNAs with preference for C49. The specificity of the methyltransferase is increased by the archease. In solution, the archease exists as a monomer, trimer, and hexamer. Only the oligomeric states bind the methyltransferase and prevent its aggregation, in addition to hindering dimerization of the methyltransferase-tRNA complex.

Archease proteins were first annotated in archaeal and eukaryal genomes and were later shown also to be present in the Bacteria (1Canaves J.M. Proteins. 2004; 56: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). According to present data base records, members of the archease superfamily belong to a cluster of orthologue genes (COG1371) and are represented in 28 eukaryal, 18 bacterial, and 25 archaeal species. This suggests that the function of these proteins has been phylogenetically conserved. However, the precise nature of this function has remained undetermined. The structures of two archeases, MTH1598 from the Archaea Methanobacter thermoautotrophicum (2Yee A. Chang X. Pineda-Lucena A. Wu B. Semesi A. Le B. Ramelot T. Lee G.M. Bhattacharyya S. Gutierrez P.

The two structures superimpose quite well (root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) 5The abbreviations used are: r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; ORF, open reading frame; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine. = 2.6 Å) despite the relatively low identity (14.8%) in their amino acid sequences (1Canaves J.M. Proteins. 2004; 56: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the two archease structures are also similar to that of the heat shock protein Hsp33 (r.m.s.d. = 3.1 Å) (4Jaroszewski L. Schwarzenbacher R. McMullan D. Abdubek P. Agarwalla S.

Burley S.K. Proteins. 2002; 47: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein Hsp33 is activated by oxidative stress and protects unfolded proteins against aggregation, whereas GyrI interacts specifically with DNA gyrase to inhibit its supercoiling activity. The structural resemblance to these proteins suggests that archeases might be engaged in similar functions. Archeases contain two SHS2 modules (also called βαβ2 folds) that are found in other proteins, including the ATPase FtsA, the RNA polymerase subunit Rpb7p, and GyrI (7Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Proteins. 2004; 56: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The two SHS2 modules in GyrI are arranged in a tandem and opposite orientation, whereas in the MTH1598 and TM1083 archeases the one SHS2 module is inserted within the other. Hsp33 has no SHS2 fold, although it possesses two slightly different S2HS2 modules (β2αβ2) arranged in the same manner as in the MTH1598 and TM1083 archeases. The S2HS2 modules probably mediate protein-protein interactions, as has been postulated for SHS2 domains (7Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Proteins. 2004; 56: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Further clues as to the function of archeases come from genome analyses, which reveal that all archease genes are adjacent to an ORF encoding a protein involved in nucleic acid processing, such as a DNA gyrase, a polymerase, or an RNA helicase (1Canaves J.M. Proteins. 2004; 56: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 7Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Proteins. 2004; 56: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The structure and the genomic location of archeases suggest that they might interact directly with these proteins. In support of this hypothesis, we additionally note that the C-terminal end of a putative Thiobacillus denitrificans tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is an archease sequence (EMBL data base number Q3SGD7). In the genome of the extreme thermophile Pyrococcus abyssi, an archease gene (PAB1946) is located immediately upstream from PAB1947 forming a putative bicistronic operon (8Alm E.J. Huang K.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 880-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). PAB1947 contains the Sun/NOL1/NOP2 family signature (Prosite profile PS01153) suggesting that it encodes an RNA m5C methyltransferase. To date, the specific RNA modifications sites of four RNA m5C methyltransferases have been identified. Two of these enzymes, the Escherichia coli rRNA m5C methyltransferases RsmB (10Gu X.R.

Biol. 2006; 359: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), are site-specific and modify 16 S rRNA at positions C967 and C1407, respectively. The two other characterized m5C methyltransferases modify eukaryal tRNAs. The Trm4 enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae targets multiple cytidines within different tRNA, modifying positions 34 or 40 in an intron-dependent manner and positions 48 and/or 49 in an intron-independent manner (13Motorin Y. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The orthologous Trm4 enzyme in humans appears to target only cytidine 34 within the intron-containing tRNALeu (14Brzezicha B. Schmidt M. Makalowska I. Jarmolowski A. Pienkowska J. Szweykowska-Kulinska Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6034-6043Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The m5C modification is common in archaeal and eukaryal tRNAs (15Sprinzl M. Vassilenko K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D139-D140Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) (summarized in Fig. 1) and is frequently found at nucleotides 48 and 49, where it improves base stacking and enhances tRNA stability (16Sowers L.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4751-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Of the presently characterized m5C methyltransferases, P. abyssi PAB1947 shows greatest sequence similarity to the Trm4 enzyme (13Motorin Y. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18King M.Y. Redman K.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11218-11225Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Bujnicki J.M. Feder M. Ayres C.L. Redman K.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2453-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting a similar substrate specificity. In this study, we determine the functions of the gene products encoded by the P. abyssi PAB1946 (the archease) and PAB1947 (the putative methyltransferase). We establish that PAB1947 does indeed encode a tRNA m5C methyltransferase, and we localize its tRNA methylation sites by a combination of biochemical and mass spectrometric techniques. Furthermore, we establish how the substrate specificity of the tRNA m5C methyltransferase and its tendency to aggregate are influenced over a range of temperatures by the P. abyssi archease. The study provides the first experimental evidence for how an archease and its co-expressed enzyme operate as a functional couple. Cloning of the P. abyssi Open Reading Frames PAB1946 and PAB1947—Recombinant versions of the archease (PAB1946) and putative methyltransferase (PAB1947) proteins were constructed with a His6 tag at their N-terminal ends. The genes were amplified from P. abyssi genomic DNA using the following PCR primers: AAAACCATGGGTCATCATCATCATCATCACAAGAGATGGGAGCACTATG (5′-primer) and AAAACTCGAGTCATATGTCGGGGACAAG (3′-primer) for PAB1946, and AAAACCATGGGTCATCATCATCATCATCACATGGACTACAAGGAAGAAT (5′-primer) and AAAACTCGAGTCACCTCGGCTTCCTTATCTTAG (3′-primer) for PAB1947. The 5′-primers created the ATG start codon in the NcoI restriction site followed by six histidine codons. The 3′-primers introduced an XhoI restriction site immediately downstream from the TGA stop codon. The amplified fragments were cut with NcoI and XhoI restriction enzymes, and were cloned into the same sites in the expression vectors pET28b and pET15b (Novagen) for PAB1946 and PAB1947, respectively. Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant Archease and PAB1947 Proteins—Archease and the PAB1947 enzyme were overexpressed in separate clones of E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Stratagene). Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing chloramphenicol and were supplemented with kanamycin for the archease plasmid and ampicillin for the PAB1947 plasmid. Recombinant protein expression was induced by 1 mm of isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside when the culture absorbance reached 0.7 at 600 nm. After a further 3 h at 28°C, cells were harvested and resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 1% (v/v) Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma). For the PAB1947 enzyme, NaCl was increased to 1 m to prevent co-purification of nucleic acids. Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The archease supernatant was added to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow™ resin (Qiagen) and mixed during 30 min at 4 °C. Special care was required to avoid aggregation of the PAB1947 enzyme, which was loaded in batches onto the resin, and purification was carried out at room temperature. Resin columns were washed with 20 mm imidazole in buffer A, and proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole for archease and 150 mm imidazole for the PAB1947 enzyme. The final respective yields were 45 and 35 mg of recombinant protein per liter of culture. After purification, archease was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT; for the PAB1947 enzyme, the buffer contained 300 mm NaCl. Both proteins were stored in aliquots at –80 °C. Cloning of the P. abyssi tRNAAsp Gene—The P. abyssi tRNAAsp gene was cloned for transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. Overlapping DNA oligonucleotides were annealed, elongated, and then amplified using Platinum™ Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The oligodeoxynucleotides sequences were as follows: (+) primer, CCCAAGCTTAATACGACTCACTATAGCCCGGGTGGTGTAGCCCGGCCTATCATGCGGGACTGTCAC; and (–) primer, CGCGGATCCTGGCGCCCGGGCCGGGATTTGAACCCGGGTCGCGGGAGTGACAGTCCCGCATGATAGGCCG. The (+) primer contained a HindIII site (underlined) upstream from the T7 promoter (italic type), and the (–) primer contained BamHI (underlined) and MvaI sites (boldface type), positioned to cleave the template for in vitro transcription. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and was inserted into the same sites in plasmid pUC18. T7 in Vitro Transcriptions of RNA—Transcription of the tRNA genes with radiolabeled [α-32P]CTP were transcribed in vitro from the T7 promoter as described previously (20Auxilien S. Crain P.F. Trewyn R.W. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 437-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The plasmid templates were digested with MvaI for P. abyssi tRNAAsp and E. coli tRNATyr2 and with BamHI for P. abyssi tRNALeu1 prior to transcription. Nonradioactive tRNAs were synthesized by using the RiboMAX™ large scale RNA production system-T7 (Promega). All tRNA transcripts were purified on 6% polyacrylamide gels; yields were around 100 μg of transcript from 10 μg of plasmid template. The rRNA fragments radiolabeled with [α-32P]CTP were T7-transcribed in vitro from single-stranded DNA templates (21Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Sissler M. Florentz C. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Methyltransferase Assays—Methylation reactions were carried out in 50 μl of 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 80 μm AdoMet (i.e. in large excess), 1 mg/ml RNase-free bovine serum albumin (Worthington), with 1 nm32P-radiolabeled RNA and 200 nm PAB1947 enzyme. In some experiments, radiolabeled tRNA (1 nm) and unlabeled tRNA (200 nm) were mixed to increase the substrate concentration. Reactions were quenched by phenol/chloroform extraction; tRNA were digested with nuclease P1 (Roche Applied Science); and modified nucleotides were identified by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (20Auxilien S. Crain P.F. Trewyn R.W. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 437-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled mono-nucleotide spots were quantified using a Storm™ system (GE Healthcare). Methyltransferase assays using nonradioactive RNA and 0.67 μm tritiated AdoMet (GE Healthcare) were carried out at 50 °C to avoid thermal degradation of the cofactor (13Motorin Y. Grosjean H. RNA (N.

Other components in the reaction were unchanged, except that 0.3 μg of tRNA transcript or poly(C) RNA (Roche Applied Science) was used. In some samples, 1.2 or 4 μm archease was added, corresponding to a 6- or 20-fold molar excess over the PAB1947 enzyme. MALDI Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Nonradioactive tRNA transcripts at 200 nm were methylated as above with the exception that KCl was replaced with ammonium acetate, pH 7.5. After 10 min of incubation at 80 °C, reactions were stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction, and tRNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation with 300 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.5. The tRNA was digested with 10–20 units of RNase T1 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in 0.5 μl of 0.5 m 3-hydroxypicolinic acid at 37 °C for 2 h. Cyclic phosphates were hydrolyzed with HCl, and the RNA oligonucleotides were dried and redissolved in H2O (12Andersen N.M. Douthwaite S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were recorded in reflector and positive ion mode on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems); spectra were smoothed and calibrated using “m/z” software (Proteometrics Inc). Tandem mass spectra were recorded in positive ion mode on a MicroMass MALDI Q-Time-of-Flight Ultima mass spectrometer (22Kirpekar F. Krogh T.N. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The collision energy used for tandem mass spectrometry was varied between 30 and 110 eV. All tandem mass spectra were smoothed using the MassLynx software supplied by the manufacturer. Determination of m5C Level in T1 Oligonucleotides of P. abyssi tRNAAsp—[α-32P]CTP-labeled P. abyssi tRNAAsp was methylated as described above with or without a 10-fold molar excess of archease. After 10 min at 80 °C, the tRNA was extracted with phenol and recovered by ethanol precipitation. The tRNA was then digested by overnight incubation in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C with 10 units of RNase T1 and 10 μg of unlabeled carrier tRNA (yeast total tRNA; Roche Applied Science). The individual RNA oligonucleotides were purified on denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels, and after extraction as described (23Brule H. Grosjean H. Giege R. Florentz C. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), they were digested with nuclease P1. The resulting mononucleotides were analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (20Auxilien S. Crain P.F. Trewyn R.W. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 437-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Gel Retardation Experiments—Radiolabeled RNA (10 fmol) was incubated with the PAB1947 enzyme and/or archease (at a 1:6 molar ratio, respectively, when used together) in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml RNase-free bovine serum albumin, 2 mm DTT at 25 °C for 20 min. Samples were quenched on ice, and bromphenol blue was added to 0.05% prior to loading on 6% polyacrylamide gels (mono/bisacrylamide, 37.5:1) containing 5% glycerol and 1 mm EDTA in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C. After electrophoresis and drying, gel bands were scanned with a Storm™ system (GE Healthcare). Gel Filtration and Stokes Radius Determination—The interaction of PAB1947 enzyme with archease was studied by gel filtration on a Superdex™ 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA. Samples, in 200 μl of the same buffer containing 150 μg (20 μm) PAB1947 enzyme and/or 450 μg (130 μm) archease, were incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature (18–20 °C) before loading onto the column and eluting at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For Stokes radius (RS) determination, the column was calibrated with bovine γ-globulin (158,000 Da; RS = 45 Å), chicken ovalbumin (44,000 Da; RS = 27.5 Å), equine myoglobin (17,000 Da; RS = 20 Å) (Bio-Rad), and bovine brain tubulin (100,000 Da; RS = 41.5 Å (24Curmi P.A.

The void volume of the column was determined from the elution volume of blue dextran. The Stokes radii of archease, PAB1947 enzyme, and their complexes were determined using Equation 1, according to Ref. (25Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), -logKav=f(RS)(Eq. 1) where Kav is the molecular sieve coefficient ((Velution – V0)/(Vgel bed – V0)). Binding of tRNA to PAB1947 or the archease-PAB1947 complex was followed by Superdex™ 200 HR 10/300 GL gel filtration (GE Healthcare) as described above. The PAB1947-tRNA complex was formed between 16 μm PAB1947 enzyme and 2.8 μm (15 μg) natural E. coli tRNATyr2 (Sigma); to form the tripartite complex, 100 μm (360 μg) archease was added before the E. coli tRNATyr2. Sedimentation Velocity and Molecular Mass Calculation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a 60 Ti four-hole rotor and cells with two-channel 12-mm path length centerpieces. Measurements were made at 50,000 rpm and at 18 °C with PAB1947 enzyme at 0.3 mg/ml and archease at 0.9 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The solvent density was 1.032 g ·cm–3, and partial specific volumes of PAB1947 enzyme (0.7441 cm3 ·g–1) and archease (0.7405 cm3 ·g–1) were calculated using SEDNTERP software (26Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar). The apparent distributions of sedimentation coefficients were calculated using Svedberg (26Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation.

The apparent molecular masses of the proteins were calculated from the Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients using the modified Svedberg Equation 2 (25Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), M=6πηN(1-vρ)⋅Rs⋅s(Eq. 2) where M is molecular mass; η is viscosity of the medium (10–2 g ·cm–1 ·s–1); N is Avogadro's number; RS is Stokes radius, s is sedimentation coefficient, v is partial specific volume, and ρ is density of the medium. Sedimentation Equilibrium—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 10,000 rpm and at 18 °C. Radial scans of the absorbance at 280 nm were taken at 3-h intervals, and equilibrium was reached after 24 h of centrifugation. The base line was recorded at 60,000 rpm, at the end of the experiment. The data were analyzed with XLAEQ and EQASSOC programs (Beckman) to calculate molecular weights. Aggregation Analyses—The PAB1947 enzyme was adjusted to a final concentration of 0.06 mg/ml in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, with or without 0.18 mg/ml of archease or BSA. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 4, 60, 65, 70, or 80 °C and were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of the same buffer and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE together with the supernatants. The P. abyssi ORF PAB1947 Encodes a tRNA m5C Methyltransferase—BLAST analysis (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60216) Google Scholar) of the P. abyssi genome identified five potential RNA m5C methyltransferases. Of these, the sequence encoded by PAB1947 is most similar to the tRNA m5C methyltransferase from S. cerevisiae, Trm4p (13Motorin Y. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18King M.Y. Redman K.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11218-11225Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Bujnicki J.M. Feder M. Ayres C.L. Redman K.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2453-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The P. abyssi PAB1947 gene was cloned in E. coli and expressed with an N-terminal His tag. The activity of the purified recombinant PAB1947 protein was tested at 50 and 80 °C against tRNA transcripts containing radiolabeled cytidine. The incubation temperatures in vitro were lower than that for optimal growth of P. abyssi (103 °C) to reduce breakdown of the individual components of the reaction. After methylation, nucleotide monophosphates were derived from the transcripts by nuclease P1 digestion and were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. Analyses of P. abyssi tRNAAsp (Fig. 2A), P. abyssi tRNALeu1, and E. coli tRNATyr2 transcripts (not shown) demonstrated that the recombinant PAB1947 protein is indeed an m5C methyltransferase and uses AdoMet as the methyl donor. Time courses of the methylation reactions were performed at 80 °C with P. abyssi tRNAAsp and tRNALeu1 (Fig. 2B). After 10 min, the PAB1947 enzyme had methylated 1.6 cytosines per tRNAAsp and 2.6 cytosines in tRNALeu1. The tRNA substrates at 200-fold higher concentrations were also methylated, and this resulted in a lower final level of m5C incorporation (Fig. 2B). The mesophilic E. coli tRNATyr2 was tested only at 50 °C to avoid degradation at the higher temperature. The PAB1947 enzyme is active on all the tRNA substrates at 50 °C (Fig. 2C), although methylation is slower than at 80 °C. Surprisingly, small fragments of ribosomal RNA (Fig. 2D) were also methylated by the PAB1947 enzyme, despite having no obvious structural similarities to tRNAs. The Unassisted PAB1947 Enzyme Methylates Multiple Cytosines in P. abyssi tRNA—Pyrococcal tRNAs have been shown previously to contain m5C (31Kowalak J.A. Dalluge J.J. McCloskey J.A. Stetter K.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7869-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), although the positions of these modifications were not determined. Here we have mapped the methylation sites in P. abyssi tRNAAsp (Fig. 3A) after incubation at 80 °C under conditions where 0.3 mol of m5C was incorporated per mol of tRNA. The methylated tRNA was digested with the guanosine-specific RNase T1, and the oligonucleotides were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. In the mass spectra (Fig. 3B), proportions of six oligonucleotides were 14 Da larger than would be expected from their predicted masses (Fig. 3C), indicating that the recombinant PAB1947 enzyme had methylated at least six different nucleotides in the tRNAAsp. The number of methylation sites is potentially higher, as some oligonucleotides (such as in the oligonucleotide CCCG) contain several cytosines and could be substoichiometrically modified at more than one cytosine under the conditions used here. From the compilation of known methylation sites (Fig. 1), only the fragments 35–43 and 47–51 were expected to contain targets for methylation. When tRNA was incubated with the PAB1947 enzyme at 50 °C instead of 80 °C, methylation became more specific for the 47–51 sequence, indicating that this oligonucleotide contained the preferred target. This methylated oligonucleotide (m/z 1622.3) was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry, and the primary site of PAB1947 methylation was unambiguously identified as the tRNA cytidine 49 (Fig. 4). The methylation site was localized more precisely to the cytosine base of nucleotide 49 from the combination of ions, including y3 that had lost methylcytosine (m/z 863.1), the free methylcytosine ion (m/z 126.1), and the lack of any methylribose ion (at m/z 111.1). Nonspecific Methylation in Vitro of Poly(C) RNA by PAB1947—Our observation that a large variety of RNAs could serve as substrates for the PAB1947 enzyme in vitro was tested further using a poly(C) RNA. The unstructured poly(C) RNA was effectively methylated at 50 °C, with most of the tritiated label from the AdoMet methyl donor becoming incorporated into the RNA (Fig. 5B). However, when the recombinant PAB1947 enzyme was substituted with a P. abyssi cell extract, no methylation of the poly(C) RNA occurred. Under comparable conditions, the cell extract efficiently catalyzed m5C formation in P. abyssi tRNAAsp transcripts, and retained this activity despite extensive dialysis (data not shown). Clearly, the naturally occurring tRNA m5C methyltransferase activity in P. abyssi cells has greater substrate specificity than the isolated recombinant PAB1947 enzyme, and this indicated that at least one essential component was missing from our in vitro assays. A clue as to what this component might be was given by its resilience to extensive dialysis. The high specificity of methylation exhibited by the P. abyssi cell extract was retained after dialysis through membranes with a cutoff at 14,000 Da. This ruled out the hypothetical component b"

In several cell types, inducible expression of sPLA2 by pro-inflammatory stimuli is attenuated by group IVA cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2α) inhibitors such as arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone, leading to the proposal that prior activation of cPLA2α is required for de novo induction of sPLA2. However, because of the broad specificity of several cPLA2α inhibitors used so far, a more comprehensive approach is needed to evaluate the relevance of this ambiguous pathway. Here, we provide evidence that the induction of sPLA2-IIA by pro-inflammatory stimuli requires group VIB calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2γ), rather than cPLA2α, in rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells. Results with small interfering RNA unexpectedly showed that the cytokine induction of sPLA2-IIA in cPLA2α knockdown cells, in which cPLA2α protein was undetectable, was similar to that in replicate control cells. By contrast, knockdown of iPLA2γ, another arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone-sensitive intracellular PLA2, markedly reduced the cytokine-induced expression of sPLA2-IIA. Supporting this finding, the R-enantiomer of bromoenol lactone, an iPLA2γ inhibitor, suppressed the cytokine-induced sPLA2-IIA expression, whereas (S)-bromoenol lactone, an iPLA2β inhibitor, failed to do so. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated sPLA2-IIA expression was also abolished by knockdown of iPLA2γ.

These products are metabolized to various bioactive lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins (PG), leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor. Currently, a number of mammalian PLA2s have been identified and classified into several families, including secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2), platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolases, and lysosomal PLA2s (1Kudo I.

Although the existence of multiple PLA2 enzymes suggests their diverse functions in the modulation of various pathophysiological conditions, the roles of most PLA2 enzymes are not fully understood until date.Among PLA2 enzymes, group IV (cPLA2) and group VI (iPLA2) families represent intracellular enzymes with a catalytic serine in their lipase consensus motif. Various studies, including gene targeting, have revealed that group IVA cPLA2 (cPLA2α), which is regulated by Ca2+-dependent membrane translocation and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation, plays a central role in stimulus-dependent eicosanoid biosynthesis (5Uozumi N.

In some cases, attenuation of stimulus-dependent expression of sPLA2-IIA (or related isozymes such as sPLA2-V) by cPLA2α inhibitors, such as arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), has been found in several cell types, leading to the proposal that prior activation of cPLA2α is required for optimal induction of sPLA2 (37Kuwata H.

However, because it is now clear that AACOCF3 and related compounds, which have been used frequently to analyze the cellular functions of cPLA2α, can also inhibit several other PLA2 enzymes with a catalytic serine (42Ackermann E.J.

Our results indicate that iPLA2γ, rather than cPLA2α, participates in the regulation of sPLA2-IIA induction in IL-1β/TNFα- and LPS-treated 3Y1 cells, and that cPLA2α is involved in delayed PGE2 biosynthesis through a mechanism independent of sPLA2-IIA regulation. Thus, these findings not only argue against the proposed contribution of cPLA2α to sPLA2-IIA induction but also reveal an unexplored signaling function of iPLA2γ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Mouse IL-1β and human TNFα were purchased from R & D Systems. AACOCF3; racemic, (S)- and (R)-bromoenol lactone (BEL); and the enzyme immunoassay kit for PGE2 were obtained from Cayman Chemicals. A23187 was purchased from Calbiochem. LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4) was purchased from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibody against human cPLA2α and goat polyclonal antibody against human COX-2 and human iPLA2β (T-14) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The cDNA and rabbit polyclonal antibody for rat sPLA2-IIA were prepared as described previously (46Komada M. Kudo I. Mizushima H. Kitamura N. Inoue K. J. Biochem.

Rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat cytosolic PGE synthase (cPGES; p23) was prepared as described previously (48Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). For preparing the antibody for iPLA2γ, the N-terminal half (amino acid residues 1–400) of human iPLA2γ was expressed in competent E. coli (BL21(DE3), Invitrogen) as a His6-tagged protein, purified by an Ni2+-chelating column (Qiagen), and then immunized into a rabbit with Freund's complete and then incomplete adjuvants. The specificity of the resulting anti-iPLA2γ antibody was verified by immunoblotting of iPLA2γ protein in several cell lines and mouse tissues as well as by neutralization of the enzymatic activity of the Sf9-expressed iPLA2γ. 4E. Yoda, Y. Nakatani, and I. Kudo, unpublished observation. The pRNA-U6.1/Hygro vector was purchased from GenScript Corp. Lipofectamine 2000, CellFECTIN, Opti-MEM medium, TRIzol reagent, hygromycin, and monoclonal antibody against V5-epitope were obtained from Invitrogen. Polymyxin B was purchased from InvivoGen. 3Y1 cells were generously given by Dr. Y. Uehara (National Institute of Infectious Disease, Tokyo). These were maintained in culture medium composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively), and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator flushed with 5% CO2 in humidified air.Activation of 3Y1 Cells—The media of 3Y1 cells or its transfectants that had attained 80% confluence in 6-well plates (Iwaki Glass) were replaced with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. After culture for 24 h, 1 ng/ml mouse IL-1β and 2 ng/ml human TNFα or 100 ng/ml LPS were added to the cultures to assess the sPLA2-IIA induction. For RNA blotting (see below), TRIzol reagent was added directly to the cell monolayer. For calcium ionophore stimulation, 1 μm A23187 was added to the cells for 10 min. The culture supernatants were taken for enzyme immunoassay for PGE2, as required.RNA Blot Analysis—All blotting procedures were performed as described previously (37Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts (5 μg) of total RNA were applied to each lane of 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and then transferred to Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore). The resulting blots were then probed with cDNA inserts and labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by random priming (Takara Biomedicals). Hybridization was conducted at 42 °C overnight in a solution comprising 50% (v/v) formamide, 0.75 m NaCl, 75 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5× Denhardt's solution (Nakarai Tesque), 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Wako). The membranes were washed three times at room temperature with 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, for 5 min each, followed by two washes at 55 °C with 30 mm NaCl, 3 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, for 15 min each. The blots were visualized by autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat AR films and double-intensifying screens at –80 °C.Cloning and Recombinant Expression of iPLA2β—RNA obtained from 3Y1 cells was subjected to reverse transcription using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding rat iPLA2β was prepared as follows: sense primer (5′-ATG CAG TTC TTT GGA CGC CTC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GGG AGA TAG CAG CAG CTG GAC-3′) were paired to amplify a 2421-bp cDNA product from the 3Y1 cell-derived cDNA by PCR using high fidelity KOD plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s and 68 °C for 2.5 m). The cDNA insert was further subjected to PCR with ExTaq polymerase (Takara Biomedicals) for 10 min at 68 °C to add an adenosine base to its 3′-ends on both the strands, followed by subcloning into pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid was digested with BamHI/PmeI, and the resulting insert was ligated into pFASTBac1 vector (Invitrogen) at the BamHI/StuI sites. The plasmid was used for bacmid preparation using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and the purified bacmid was then transfected into Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) with CellFECTIN to produce baculovirus bearing the C-terminally V5-tagged iPLA2β. Amplification of the virus was performed by adding an aliquot of the initial virus pool to fresh, sub-confluent Sf9 cells in 150-mm dishes (Iwaki). After incubation for 48 h at 27 °C, all the infected cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold saline, resuspended in 500 μl of SET buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA), sonicated (3 × 10 s bursts) using a BLANSON sonicator at 30% output, and centrifuged at 2300 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was used as an enzyme source for PLA2 enzyme assay (see below). The expression of C-terminally V5-tagged iPLA2β protein in Sf9 cells was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibody (supplemental Fig. S1).Cloning and Recombinant Expression of iPLA2γ—Total RNA from mouse brain was subjected to a reverse transcription reaction using an RNA PCR kit (avian myeloblastosis virus, Takara Biomedicals). The obtained cDNA was subjected to PCR using mouse iPLA2γ sense (5′-TGG AAT GAG AGA ATG TCA CAT AG-3′) and antisense (5′-TCA CAA TTT TGA AAA AAA TGG AAG GCC-3′) primers (35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 m). The PCR product was subcloned into pCR3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The insert was digested out and subcloned into pFASTBac1 vector at KpnI/NotI sites. Baculovirus expressing recombinant iPLA2γ and the homogenate of the virus-infected Sf9 cells were prepared as described above. The expression of iPLA2γ protein was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-iPLA2γ antibody described above (supplemental Fig. S1).Establishment of Cell Lines Expressing cPLA2α- or iPLA2γ-directed siRNA—Synthesized oligonucleotides (BEX) with the target sequences for cPLA2α and iPLA2γ siRNAs were each subcloned into pRNA-U6.1/Hygro (GenScript Corp.) at the HindIII/BamHI sites. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were as follows: 5′-GAT CCC GCA TCA ACT TCA GAA AGT ACT TCA AGA GAG TAC TTT CTG AAG TTG ATG TTT TTT GGA AA-3′ and 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA CAT CAA CTT CAG AAA GTA CTC TCT TGA AGT ACT TTC TGA AGT TGA TGC GG-3′ for cPLA2α; and 5′-GAT CCC GAT AGA CAG CTT CAG GAC TTC AAG AGA GTC CTG AAG CTG TCT ATC TTT TTT GGA AA-3′ and 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA GAT AGA CAG CTT CAG GAC TCT CTT GAA GTC CTG AAG CTG TCT ATC GG-3′ for iPLA2γ. The plasmids were transfected into 3Y1 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three days after transfection, the cells were seeded into 96-well plates in the presence of 100 μg/ml hygromycin to establish stable transfectants. The expression levels of cPLA2α and iPLA2γ in the obtained transfectants in comparison with those in mock-transfected control cells were assessed by RNA blotting and immunoblotting.Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates (105 cells equivalent) were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% (w/v) gels under reducing conditions (for cPLA2α, iPLA2γ, and COX-2) or 15% (w/v) gels under non-reducing conditions (for sPLA2-IIA and cPGES). The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) with a semidry blotter (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After blocking for 2 h with 3% (w/v) skimmed milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were probed for 2 h with the respective antibodies (1:5,000 for sPLA2-IIA, iPLA2γ, COX-2, and cPGES and 1:2,000 for cPLA2α), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (1:2,000 for cPLA2α), anti-rabbit (1:5,000 for sPLA2-IIA, cPGES, and iPLA2γ), or anti-goat (1:10,000 for COX-2) IgG. After being washed, the membranes were visualized with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as described previously (49Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Measurement of iPLA2 Activity—Appropriate amounts of the enzyme preparations were preincubated with various concentrations of PLA2 inhibitors on ice for 20 min, and then incubated with 2 μm 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Amersham Biosciences) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EGTA for 10 min at 37 °C. The released [14C]linoleic acid was extracted by Dole's reagent, and radioactivity was counted, as described previously (50Hamaguchi K. Kuwata H. Yoshihara K. Masuda S. Shimbara S. Ohishi S.

Acta. 2003; 1635: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).RESULTSAnalyses with Group IVA cPLA2α Knockdown 3Y1 Cells—Our previous studies have shown that, in 3Y1 cells, IL-1β/TNFα-stimulated induction of sPLA2-IIA is markedly reduced by AACOCF3, a cPLA2α inhibitor (37Kuwata H.

To address whether cPLA2α is involved in the cytokine-dependent sPLA2-IIA induction or the previous observations merely reflect the nonspecific effect of AACOCF3, we first established cPLA2α-knockdown (cPLA2α-KD) 3Y1 cells by using an siRNA strategy. Fig. 1A depicts the expression levels of several constitutively expressed arachidonate-metabolizing enzymes, including cPLA2α, COX-1, and cPGES, in cells stably transfected with cPLA2α-specific siRNA or with mock vector, as assessed by immunoblotting. The expression of cPLA2α protein disappeared to an undetectable level in cPLA2α-KD cells, whereas the expression levels of COX-1 and cPGES were similar in both the cells (Fig. 1A). When these cells were incubated for 10 min with the calcium ionophore A23187, the immediate PGE2 biosynthesis was nearly absent in cPLA2α-KD cells as compared with those in mock-transfectants in which robust PGE2 synthesis was evident (Fig. 1B), thus substantiating our previous studies employing the cPLA2α inhibitor (37Kuwata H.

We also found that IL-1β/TNFα stimulated delayed PGE2 biosynthesis, which we had proposed to be mediated by synergistic action of cPLA2α and sPLA2-IIA on the basis of the inhibitory effects of AACOCF3 and sPLA2-IIA-directed antisense oligonucleotide, respectively (37Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol.

These results support the notion that cPLA2α contributes almost entirely to the A23187-elicited immediate and partially to the cytokine-induced delayed PGE2-synthetic responses. Of note, relative contribution of cPLA2α to the cytokine-induced response was greater during the first 24 h than after 24–48 h (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the later phase of the delayed response depends more on the cPLA2α-independent, probably sPLA2-IIA-mediated (as sPLA2-IIA induction reaches a maxima over this period (37Kuwata H.

This transmembrane receptor has 15 homologous extracellular repeat domains and a short intracellular domain, which lacks kinase activity (1Scott C.D. Firth S.M. Horm. Metab. Res. 2004; 36: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The IGF2R plays a major role in targeting mannose 6-phosphate-labeled proteins via the trans-Golgi network and from the cellular membrane to lysosomes for degradation (2Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). It also binds and internalizes IGF-II, thereby maintaining correct levels of IGF-II locally and in the circulation. These functions are central in the processes of embryonic development and normal growth. Mice lacking the IGF2R have increased levels of circulating IGF-II, are born larger, and die soon after birth due to cardiac hyperplasia. This phenotype is overcome by concomitant deletion of the IGF-II gene (3Ludwig T. Eggenschwiler J. Fisher P. D'Ercole A.J. Davenport M.L. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 517-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Likewise, loss of IGF2R activity in many cancers has been associated with increased tumor cell growth and tumor progression. This can arise from the loss of heterozygosity or mutation of the receptor (4De Souza A.T. Hankins G.R. Washington M.K. Orton T.C. Jirtle R.L. Nat.

Brown J. Jones E.Y. Catto L.E. Crump M.P. Hassan A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 403-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although the binding site on domain 11 has been mapped, it is not yet clear whether IGF-II contacts domain 13. IGF-I and IGF-II share >60% sequence identity, yet the IGF2R only binds IGF-II with high affinity. Little is known about this interaction, since relatively few IGF-II mutants have been made, and a structure of the IGF2R·IGF-II complex has not been solved. Residues Phe48, Arg49, and Ser50 have been strongly implicated in IGF2R binding (14Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these residues are conserved between IGF-I and IGF-II and therefore would not drive the specificity of binding. Ala54 and Leu55 of IGF-II differ from the corresponding residues in IGF-I (Arg55, Arg56) and are important for IGF2R binding (15Forbes B.E. McNeil K.A. Scott C.D. Surinya K.H. Cosgrove L.J. Wallace J.C. Growth Factors. 2001; 19: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently showed that IGF-II residues in the nonconserved C domain are important for IGF2R binding and play a role in conferring the specificity of binding (16Roche P. Brown J. Denley A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. Jones E.Y. Esnouf R.M. Proteins. 2006; 64: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the effects of mutation on residue Ala54 or Leu55 or the C domain are insufficient to account for the complete lack of binding by IGF-I, suggesting that another determinant provides the IGF-II specificity. In this study, we have significantly added to our understanding of the IGF2R binding site on IGF-II using a mutagenesis approach and surface plasmon resonance with isolated IGF2R domains. We have revealed a novel hydrophobic patch critical for IGF2R binding, which encompasses residues Phe19 and Leu53 and includes Thr16 and Asp52. We have also identified the major determinant on IGF-II responsible for the specificity of IGF2R binding. Materials—Oligonucleotides (Table 1) were purchased from Geneworks Pty. Ltd.

(19King R. Wells J.R. Krieg P. Snoswell M. Brazier J. Bagley C.J. Wallace J.C. Ballard F.J. Ross M. Francis G.L. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the cDNA encoding IGF-II was introduced into the vector as previously described (20Francis G.L. Aplin S.E. Milner S.J. McNeil K.A. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to incorporate the 14 different mutations into IGF-II (Table 1). Resultant constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli JM101 (lac Iq) for expression. IGF-II mutants were expressed as fusion proteins with the first 11 amino acids of porcine growth hormone ([Met1]pGH-(1–11)) after isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside induction. Inclusion bodies were isolated as previously described (19King R. Wells J.R. Krieg P. Snoswell M. Brazier J. Bagley C.J. Wallace J.C. Ballard F.J. Ross M. Francis G.L. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Refolding and Purification of IGF-II Analogues—Inclusion bodies containing the IGF-II fusion peptides were processed essentially as described (20Francis G.L. Aplin S.E. Milner S.J. McNeil K.A. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, washed inclusion bodies from a 0.5-liter fermentation were solubilized in 8 m urea containing 40 mm glycine, 0.1 m Tris, and 16 mm dithiothreitol at pH 2.0. Inclusion bodies were immediately desalted on a Superdex 75 column (1 × 30 cm (GE Healthcare) in two 2-ml batches) using the same buffer but with 1.6 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions containing the IGF-II fusion protein were identified by SDS-PAGE and reverse phase chromatography and pooled prior to folding in 2.5 m urea, 12.5 mm glycine, 0.7 m Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide, pH 9.1, and dilution to less than 0.1 mg/ml. Cleavage of the fusion partner and a final reverse phase HPLC cleanup were achieved as previously described (21Lien S. Milner S.J. Graham L.D. Wallace J.C. Francis G.L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 74: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Shooter G.K. Magee B. Soos M.A. Francis G.L. Siddle K. Wallace J.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 17: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were analyzed by mass spectroscopy and N-terminal sequencing (Dr. Chris Bagley and Chris Cursaro (Adelaide Proteomics Facility)) and were shown to have the correct masses and to be greater than 95% pure. Quantitation of analogues was performed by comparing analytical C4 HPLC profiles with profiles of standard Long™R3IGF-I preparations (23Milner S.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. Magee B.A. Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-815 CD spectrometer. Spectra were recorded from 250 to 185 nm with a 1.0-nm step size using a 1.0-s response time and 1.0-nm bandwidth. Three accumulations were recorded for each spectrum. Samples were analyzed in a quartz cuvette with a 0.1-cm path length. Spectra were background-corrected by subtraction of the spectrum of buffer alone. In order to allow direct comparison of spectra without the interference from small differences in quantification of protein concentration, all spectra were normalized to the ellipticity measured at 207 nm (24Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). IGF-1R Binding Assay—Receptor binding affinities were measured using an assay similar to that described for analyzing epidermal growth factor binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor (25Mazor O. Hillairet de Boisferon M. Lombet A. Gruaz-Guyon A. Gayer B. Skrzydelsky D. Kohen F. Forgez P. Scherz A. Rostene W. Salomon Y. Anal.

Briefly, P6 cells were serum-starved prior to lysis with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 rpm at 4 °C, and then 100-μl aliquots were added to wells of a white Greiner Lumitrac 600 plate previously coated with anti-IGF-1R antibody 24-31 (2.5 μg/ml) (26Soos M.A. Field C.E. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Zhang B. Roth R.A. Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Siddle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12955-12963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 500,000 fluorescence counts of europium-labeled IGF-II were added to each well along with increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Wells were washed four times with 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) and twice with water, and then DELFIA enhancement solution (100 μl/well) was added. Time-resolved fluorescence was measured using 340-nm excitation and 612-nm emission filters with a BMG Laboratory Technologies Polarstar fluorimeter (Mornington, Australia). IGF2R Fragments—IGF2R domain 11 (IGF2R-d11) and IGF2R domains 11–13 (IGF2R-d11–13) were prepared as described previously (12Brown J. Esnouf R.M. Jones M.A. Linnell J. Harlos K. Hassan A.B. Jones E.Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1054-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Roche P. Brown J. Denley A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. Jones E.Y. Esnouf R.M. Proteins. 2006; 64: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, IGF2R-d11 was expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli and refolded, whereas IGF2R-d11–13 was produced as soluble protein in a mammalian expression system. The latter approach was also used for preparation of IGF2R domains 11 and 12 (IGF2R-d11-12), IGF2R domains 10–13 (IGF2R-d10–13), and IGF2R domains 11–14 (IGF2R-d11–14). The required regions of igf2r were amplified by PCR using appropriate primers, which also introduced a C-terminal carboxypeptidase A-cleavable histidine tag (Lys-His6-STOP). After cloning into the pEE14 vector (27Davis S.J. Brady R.L. Barclay A.N. Harlos K. Dodson G.G. Williams A.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the construct was verified by sequencing and transfected into Lec3.2.8.1 Chinese hamster ovary cells (28Stanley P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1981; 1: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using Pfx-8 lipids (Invitrogen). Following expression under methionine sulfoxamine selection, secreted proteins were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and gel filtration (Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow and HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200; GE Healthcare). Kinetic Studies of IGF2R Binding Using Surface Plasmon Resonance—Each IGF2R fragment was coupled to the CM5 biosensor chip using a similar method to that previously described (16Roche P. Brown J. Denley A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. Jones E.Y. Esnouf R.M. Proteins. 2006; 64: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IGF2R fragment to be bound was prepared in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, at 18 μg/ml and injected over the NHS/EDC activated chip surface in HBS running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4). The surfaces were then deactivated by 1 m ethanolamine. A blank flow cell was used as a reference on all chips. Binding analyses were performed at 25 °C using a BIAcore 2000 biosensor (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) within the Flinders Advanced Analytical Laboratories (Flinders University, South Australia). The IGF2R-d10–13, IGF2R-d11–13, and IGF2R-d11–14 fragments were coupled to the biosensor surface to give a final resonance value of 2000 response units, whereas IGF2R-d11 and IGF2R-d11-12 were coupled to final values of 500 and 1000 response units, respectively. The proportion of active surface was >90% for all surfaces except for the IGF2R-d11–14 surface, which was 70% active. IGF-II, IGF-I, and IGF analogues were injected over the chip surfaces at the following concentrations: IGF-II, E12K IGF-II, V14T IGF-II, Q18A IGF-II, F19L IGF-II, F28L IGF-II, and V43M IGF-II at concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 nm; T16A IGF-II, F19A IGF-II, F19S IGF-II, F19Y IGF-II, D52K IGF-II, D52E and D52N IGF-II, L53A IGF-II, IGF-I, and A13T IGF-I at 500, 400, 200, 100, and 50 nm in HBS running buffer for 2.5 min at a flow rate of 40 μl/min to minimize mass transfer effects. Dissociation of bound analyte in HBS buffer alone was measured at the same flow rate for 15 min. All flow cells were regenerated by injection of 60 μl of 10 mm HCl. Reference flow cell data were subtracted from all runs to account for bulk refractive index due to the buffer. All kinetic data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.2 software (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). IGF2R-d11 and IGF2R-d11-12 curves were fitted globally across all concentrations to a steady state affinity model. The steady state model describes the affinity of the interaction at equilibrium. The IGF2R-d10–13, IGF2R-d11–13, and IGF2R-d11–14 curves were fitted using a two-state conformational change model and were derived from fitting of the 50 nm curves. This model describes a 1:1 binding interaction with a conformational change upon binding, resulting in two association and dissociation rates. This model resulted in the best fitting of the data and has been previously used for analysis of binding to IGF2R fragments (13Zaccheo O.J. Prince S.N. Miller D.M. Williams C. Kemp C.F. Brown J. Jones E.Y. Catto L.E. Crump M.P. Hassan A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 403-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each mutant was analyzed in duplicate in a minimum of two separate experiments. The affinity constant (KA) derived from eight separate experiments on two separate chips for IGF-II on IGF2R-d10–13 was 1.5 ± 0.4 × 108m-1, and a similar variation between experiments was seen on all surfaces with all mutants analyzed. Production and Characterization of IGF-II Analogues—Fourteen novel IGF-II analogues were made to define the IGF2R binding site. Only Val43 had previously been mutated, and substitutions were designed to probe the properties of each residue. Analogues with Ala substitutions included T16A IGF-II, Q18A IGF-II, F19A IGF-II, and L53A IGF-II. The potential role of hydrophobicity at position 19 was investigated by further substitutions with Ser, Tyr, and Leu. The effect of charge reversal at position 12 (Glu) was probed by substitution with Lys. Val14 was changed to the equivalent residue in insulin (Thr), and the smaller hydrophobic residue of Leu was used in place of Phe at position 28. Val43 was substituted with Met. The equivalent mutation in IGF-I (V44M), identified as the first missense mutation in the IGF-I gene, leads to an IGF-I with severely impaired IGF-1R binding (29Walenkamp M.J. Karperien M. Pereira A.M. Hilhorst-Hofstee Y. van Doorn J. Chen J.W. Mohan S. Denley A. Forbes B. van Duyvenvoorde H.A. van Thiel S.W. Sluimers C.A. Bax J.J. de Laat J.A. Breuning M.B. Romijn J.A. Wit J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The contribution of the Asp52 side chain was probed by substitution with Asn, Gln, and Glu. Far UV circular dichroism was used to test the structural integrity of the analogues. Misfolding of IGFs can be identified by a significant change in the far UV CD spectrum (30Gill R. Verma C. Wallach B. Urso B. Pitts J. Wollmer A. De Meyts P. Wood S. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The following analogues exhibited spectra indistinguishable from IGF-II: E12K IGF-II, V14T IGF-II, Q18A IGF-II, F19A IGF-II, F19Y IGF-II, F19S IGF-II, F19L IGF-II, F28L IGF-II, V43M IGF-II, D52N IGF-II, and L53A IGF-II (Fig. 1). Small deviations in CD signal intensities for T16A IGF-II, D52K IGF-II, and D52E IGF-II were observed, but the introduced changes appear to have little overall effect on secondary structure, and we believe that correct folding was achieved. Further evidence of structural integrity was provided by analyzing IGF-1R binding. Misfolded IGF-I has a 30-fold lower affinity for the IGF-1R (30Gill R. Verma C. Wallach B. Urso B. Pitts J. Wollmer A. De Meyts P. Wood S. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and a similar reduction in IGF-1R affinity is seen for misfolded IGF-II (31Oh Y. Beukers M.W. Pham H.M. Smanik P.A. Smith M.C. Rosenfeld R.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 6C. Delaine, C. L. Alvino, K. A. McNeil, J. C. Wallace, and B. E. Forbes, unpublished observation. All of the mutants that had CD spectra that differed from IGF-II (T16A, D52K, and D52E) retained the ability to bind the IGF-1R with high affinity (only 2–3-fold lower affinity; Table 2). D52E IGF-II had the greatest change in far UV CD spectrum, yet its IGF-1R binding affinity was only 3-fold lower than IGF-II (Table 2). We therefore believe this mutant is correctly folded, but the difference in CD spectrum represents local structural perturbations.TABLE 2Inhibition of europium-labeled IGF-II binding to the IGF-1R by IGF-II analogues The IC50 relative to that of IGF-II binding to the IGF-1R (IC50 IGF-II/ IC50 IGF-II analogue) is shown, and values are the means and ± S.E. from three independent experiments.LigandIC50Affinity relative to IGF-IInmIGF-I1.4 ± 0.32.4Insulin>100<0.01IGF-II3.4 ± 0.21E12K8.5 ± 2.70.4V14T28.6 ± 4.50.1T16A12.1 ± 30.3E18A4.8 ± 1.20.7F19A7.7 ± 1.30.4F19S5.4 ± 1.70.6F19Y6.5 ± 1.10.5F19L4.6 ± 1.50.7F28L21.6 ± 3.30.2V43M>100<0.01D52N2.0 ± 2.71.7D52K5.9 ± 0.90.6D52E10.7 ± 4.50.3L53A7.3 ± 0.40.5 Open table in a new tab Although the CD spectra indicated no structural perturbations for V14T IGF-II, F28L IGF-II, and V43M IGF-II, their IGF-1R binding was significantly perturbed. This result was not unexpected, since all three residues correspond to IGF-I residues found in the “classic” binding surface that is essential for IGF-1R binding (32De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Mutation of Val11 in IGF-I (equivalent to Val14 in IGF-II) to Thr also results in a reduction in IGF-1R binding affinity (3-fold) (33Hodgson D.R. May F.E. Westley B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mutation of Val44 IGF-I or ValA3 insulin (Val43 in IGF-II) to Met or Leu, respectively, disrupts receptor binding without causing gross structural perturbation (34Wan Z.L. Huang K. Xu B. Hu S.Q.

IGF2R Binding—Having established that all of the analogues were correctly folded, we then used surface plasmon resonance to test their ability to bind five different IGF2R fragments. The five IGF2R fragments included two low affinity fragments, IGF2R-d11 and IGF2R-d11-12, and three high affinity fragments, IGF2R-d10–13, IGF2R-d11–13, and IGF2R-d11–14. Association constants (KA) of 5.4 × 106 and 10.75 × 106m-1 observed for IGF-II binding to IGF2R-d11 and IGF2R-d11-12 were similar to previous reports (13Zaccheo O.J. Prince S.N. Miller D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2008659608,"An improved understanding of cell immortalization and its manifestation in clinical tumors could facilitate novel therapeutic approaches. However, only rare tumor cells, which maintain telomerase expression in vitro, immortalize spontaneously. By expression-profiling analyses of limited-life primary breast tumor cultures pre- and post-hTERT transduction, and spontaneously immortalized breast cancer cell lines, we identified a common signature characteristic of tumor cell immortalization. A predominant feature of this immortalization signature (ImmSig) was the significant overexpression of oxidoreductase genes. In contrast to epithelial cells derived from low histologic grade primary tumors, which required hTERT transduction for the acquisition of ImmSig, spontaneously immortalizing high-grade tumor cultures displayed similar molecular changes independent of exogenous hTERT. Silencing the hTERT gene reversed ImmSig expression, increased cellular reactive oxygen species levels, altered mitochondrial membrane potential and induced apoptotic and proliferation changes in immortalized cells. In clinical breast cancer samples, cell-proliferation-pathway genes were significantly associated with ImmSig. In these cases, ImmSig expression itself was inversely correlated with patient survival (P=0), and was particularly relevant to the outcome of estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Our data support the notion that ImmSig assists in surmounting normal barriers related to oxidative and replicative stress response. Targeting a subset of aggressive breast cancers by reversing ImmSig components could be a practical therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2120713967,"Therapeutically valuable proteins are often rare and/or unstable in their natural context, calling for production solutions in heterologous systems. A relevant example is that of the stress-induced, normally rare, and naturally unstable ""read-through"" human acetylcholinesterase variant, AChE-R. AChE-R shares its active site with the synaptic AChE-S variant, which is the target of poisonous organophosphate anticholinesterase insecticides such as the parathion metabolite paraoxon. Inherent AChE-R overproduction under organophosphate intoxication confers both short-term protection (as a bioscavenger) and long-term neuromuscular damages (as a regulator). Here we report the purification, characterization, and testing of human, endoplasmic reticulum-retained AChE-R(ER) produced from plant-optimized cDNA in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. AChE-R(ER) purified to homogeneity showed indistinguishable biochemical properties, with IC50 = 10(-7) M for the organophosphate paraoxon, similar to mammalian cell culture-derived AChE. In vivo titration showed dose-dependent protection by intravenously injected AChE-R(ER) of FVB/N male mice challenged with a lethal dose of paraoxon, with complete elimination of short-term clinical symptoms at near molar equivalence. By 10 days postexposure, AChE-R prophylaxis markedly limited postexposure increases in plasma murine AChE-R levels while minimizing the organophosphate-induced neuromuscular junction dismorphology. Our findings present plant-produced AChE-R(ER) as a bimodal agent, conferring both short- and long-term protection from organophosphate intoxication."
https://openalex.org/W2093425119,"Nectin is an immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecule, which plays essential roles in the initial step of formation of adherens junctions and tight junctions. We demonstrate here the role of nectin-1 in the epidermis using nectin-1–/– mice. Newborn nectin-1–/– pups showed shiny and slightly reddish skin; the amount of loricrin, one of the differentiation markers and also a major component of cornified cell envelopes, was markedly reduced in the epidermis of nectin-1–/– mice. The amounts of repetin and SPRRP, other components of cornified cell envelopes, were markedly elevated probably due to a compensatory mechanism to overcome the impaired expression of loricrin. However, cornified cells from nectin-1–/– mice were sensitive to mechanical stress. Moreover, Ca2+-induced activation of ERK through Rap1 and expression of loricrin were reduced in primary cultured nectin-1–/– keratinocytes; in turn, the inhibition of ERK activation reduced the amount of loricrin in wild-type keratinocytes. These results indicate that nectin-1 plays a key role in the expression of loricrin in the epidermis.

These results indicate that nectin-1 plays a key role in the expression of loricrin in the epidermis. The mammalian epidermis, the outermost surface of the body, consists of a multilayered epithelium (the interfollicular epidermis) and appendages including hair follicles and sebaceous and sweat glands (1Watt F.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 410-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The epidermis comprises four stratified layers, including basal, spinous, granular, and cornified layers, and is a continuously renewing tissue composed of keratinocytes at diverse stages of differentiation (2Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The cells in the basal layer of the epidermis proceed to terminal differentiation upon leaving the basal layer. Some members of the integrin family, such as integrin β1, have been reported to be involved in this terminal differentiation (3Watt F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3919-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanism of terminal differentiation is largely unknown. The main functions of the epidermis, including acting as a barrier against the external environment and preventing water loss from the inside body, are considerably dependent on the existence of adherens junctions (AJs) 2The abbreviations used are: AJ, adherens junction; Ab, antibody; CAM, cell-cell adhesion molecule; JAM, junctional adhesion molecule; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; SPRRP, small proline-rich protein; TJ, tight junction; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. and tight junctions (TJs) in the epidermis (4Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar, 5Tsukita S. Furuse M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The functions of AJs and TJs have been well characterized in single layered epithelial cells. AJs serve as a mechanically adhesive apparatus between neighboring cells, whereas TJs act as barriers to prevent leakage of molecules through the gaps between cells and also function as fences to keep the cell surface molecules at the basolateral region separate from those at the apical region (4Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar, 5Tsukita S. Furuse M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, the formation of TJs always occurs at the apical side of AJs and mainly depends on the formation of AJs. The major cell-cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) at AJs are cadherin and nectin (6Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar, 7Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and those at TJs are claudin, occludin, and junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) (4Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar, 5Tsukita S. Furuse M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It has been believed for a long time that only fragmented strands of TJs exist in a part of the granular layer and that they do not contribute to the epidermal barrier function (8Elias P.M. McNutt N.S. Friend D.S. Anat. Rec. 1977; 189: 577-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The results obtained with claudin-1–/– mice have revealed that there are continuous claudin-based TJ strands in the granular layer, which are indispensable for the barrier function of the mammalian skin (9Furuse M. Hata M. Furuse K. Yoshida Y. Haratake A. Sugitani Y. Noda T. Kubo A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1099-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies on the epidermis-specific loss of E-cadherin, one of CAMs at AJs, have displayed the epidermal abnormalities in the conditional knock-out mice (10Tinkle C.L. Lechler T. Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Tunggal J.A. Helfrich I. Schmitz A. Schwarz H. Gunzel D. Fromm M. Kemler R. Krieg T. Niessen C.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Thus, the components of AJs and TJs may play important roles in the maintenance of epidermal functions. Nectin is an immunoglobulin-like CAM that comprises a family of four members: nectin-1, nectin-2, nectin-3, and nectin-4 (7Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 12Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 13Shimizu K. Takai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Sakisaka T. Takai Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Each member has one extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like loops, one transmembrane region, and one intracellular region. Each nectin forms homo-cis-dimers and then homo- or hetero-trans-dimers (trans-interactions) in a Ca2+-independent manner to achieve cell-cell adhesion. At its cytoplasmic tail, nectin binds afadin, which connects nectin to the actin cytoskeleton. Recent evidence has shown that nectin first trans-interacts with each other and then recruits cadherin to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites, leading to the formation of AJs (7Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 12Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W.

Takai Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, nectin recruits first JAM and then claudin and occludin to the apical side of AJs, resulting in the formation of TJs (15Fukuhara A. Irie K. Nakanishi H. Takekuni K. Kawakatsu T. Ikeda W.

Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have shown that normal human epidermis expresses nectin-1 at the cell-cell junctions and that nectin-1 colocalizes with E-cadherin there (25Matsushima H. Utani A. Endo H. Matsuura H. Kakuta M. Nakamura Y. Matsuyoshi N. Matsui C. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Shinkai H. Br. J. Dermatol. 2003; 148: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The expression of nectin-1 at cell-cell junctions was reduced in human epithelial cancer cells located at the advancing border of the tumor, losing the cell-cell junctions and facilitating the invasion of cancer cells into the neighboring tissue. Mutations in human nectin-1 are also responsible for cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia, which includes Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome and Margarita Island ectodermal dysplasia (26Sozen M.A. Suzuki K.

These results strongly suggest that nectin-1 plays important physiological and pathological roles in the formation and maintenance of cell-cell junctions in the epidermis. To further explore the role of nectin-1 in morphology of the epidermis, we first examined the phenotypes of the epidermis in wild-type and nectin-1–/– mice and then analyzed the difference of their phenotypes on the molecular level using keratinocytes prepared from both types of mice. Generation of Nectin-1–/– Mice—Nectin-1–/– mice were generated as described previously (22Inagaki M. Irie K. Ishizaki H. Tanaka-Okamoto M. Morimoto K. Inoue E. Ohtsuka T. Miyoshi J. Takai Y. Development. 2005; 132: 1525-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In brief, nectin-1+/– mice with mixed genetic background were back-crossed at least six times onto the C57BL/6 strain and were then intercrossed to obtain nectin-1–/– mice. Experiments were performed on these nectin-1–/– mice and littermate nectin-1+/+ (wild-type) mice. The animals and procedures used in this study were in accordance with the animal care guidelines of and approved by the Osaka University Medical School Animal Care and Use Committee. Antibodies—A rabbit anti-nectin-1 polyclonal antibody (pAb), which recognizes the intracellular region of both mouse and human nectin-1, was prepared as described (25Matsushima H. Utani A. Endo H.

Rat anti-nectin-1 and rat anti-nectin-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), both of which recognize the extracellular regions of nectin-1 and nectin-2, respectively, were prepared as described (18Mizoguchi A.

All of the following Abs were purchased from commercial sources: a rabbit anti-mouse keratin 5 pAb (Covance), a rabbit anti-mouse keratin 10 pAb (Covance), a rabbit anti-filaggrin pAb (Covance), a rabbit anti-involucrin pAb (Covance), a rabbit anti-laminin pAb (Sigma), a rabbit anti-loricrin pAb (Covance), a mouse anti-Ki-67 mAb (Novocastra), a mouse anti-phospho-ERK1/2 mAb (Cell Signaling Technology and Sigma), a mouse anti-ERK1/2 mAb (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), a mouse anti-phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) mAb (Cell Signaling Technology), a rabbit anti-p38 MAPK pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), a rabbit anti-JNK pAb (Cell Signaling Technology), a mouse anti-phospho-JNK mAb (Cell Signaling Technology), a rabbit anti-Rap1 pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a mouse anti-Ras mAb (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (22Inagaki M. Irie K. Ishizaki H. Tanaka-Okamoto M. Morimoto K. Inoue E. Ohtsuka T. Miyoshi J. Takai Y. Development. 2005; 132: 1525-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse back skin was dissected and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then sectioned by a cryostat at 10 μm. The sections were mounted on glass slides, air-dried, and washed three times with PBS. After being blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin, the samples were incubated with the primary Abs indicated in the figures. The samples were observed by Radiance 2100 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). Immunoblot Analysis—As described previously (30Sakai S. Endo Y. Ozawa N. Sugawara T. Kusaka A. Sayo T. Tagami H. Inoue S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 79-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the epidermis was homogenized in a lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris hydroxymethyl aminomethan-HCl (pH 9.0), 8 m urea, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged (15,000 × g for 15 min). The supernatant was used for immunoblotting. Primary keratinocytes were collected by scraping into Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed by sonication on ice and centrifuged (15,000 × g for 15 min). The supernatant was used for immunoblotting. Equal amounts of protein in each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were immunoblotted with the primary Ab, followed by the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health), and paired Student's t tests were performed for statistical analysis. Sonication Experiment, Barrier Function, and Water Loss Assays—For the sonication experiment, cornified cells were prepared as described (31Koch P.J. de Viragh P.A. Scharer E. Bundman D. Longley M.A. Bickenbach J. Kawachi Y. Suga Y. Zhou Z. Huber M. Hohl D. Kartasova T. Jarnik M. Steven A.C. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Isolated cornified cells were suspended in 2% SDS solution and sonicated with a TAITEC sonicator for 15 min. The skin barrier assay was performed as previously described (31Koch P.J. de Viragh P.A.

Briefly, after the backs of newborn pups were soaked in 1 mm lucifer yellow solution for 1 h, the pups were killed, and frozen back skin sections were prepared as described above. The penetration of the dye was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. For the water loss assay, the weight of newborn pups was monitored at the indicated time points for 24 h without feeding the pups. Data are presented as the percentage of initial body weights. Reverse Transcription PCR—Total mRNA was extracted from the epidermis of newborn mice using ISOGEN (Wako). The extracted total mRNA was treated with the RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega). For semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR, first strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the Ready To Go reverse transcription-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) with the pd(N)6 primer. Second strand cDNA synthesis and PCR were carried out using ExTaq polymerase (Takara). The loricrin, SPRRP2A, SPRRP2D, repetin, and GAPDH primers were as follows: loricrin, aacagtatcagtgccagagc (forward) and tctgactggtctgctgagag (reverse); SPRRP2A, ctgagactcaagtacgatgtcttactacc (forward) and ttttctgtgaggagccatcataggcac (reverse); SPRRP2D, acccgatcctgagaatccagcact (forward) and tttgtcctgatgactgctgaagac (reverse); repetin, atcctccctggctcctgcct (forward) and tgttgcctgatttctgatgctgacttccata (reverse); GAPDH, cccatcaccatcttccagga (forward) and ttgtcataccaggaaatgagc (reverse). PCR was performed with cycles at 96 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. PCR products were collected every five cycles from 25 to 35 cycles and examined by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. For quantitative real time PCR, we used TaqMan probes and the Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT Sequencing Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The repetin and GAPDH TaqMan probes, primer mix, and TaqMan Universal PCR master Mix were purchased from Applied Biosystems. PCR was performed with 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. After 40 cycles, data were processed using the software accompanying the Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT Sequencing Detection System. The threshold cycle was automatically determined by the software. The mRNA level of repetin was normalized to that of GAPDH. Primary Culture of Mouse Keratinocytes—Mouse keratinocytes were cultured as described (33Kobayashi T. Okumura H. Hashimoto K. Asada H. Inui S. Yoshikawa K. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1998; 17: 108-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-thickness skin taken from newborn mice was treated with 10 mg/ml dispase (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C. The epidermis was peeled off from the dermis, followed by trypsinization to isolate mouse keratinocytes. Collected mouse primary keratinocytes were cultured in MCDB153HAA medium (Nihon Pharmaceutical Co.) supplemented with insulin (5 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 μm), ethanolamine (0.1 mm), phosphoethanolamine (0.1 mm), and bovine hypothalamic extract (150 μg/ml). After keratinocytes reached confluence, the Ca2+ concentration in the culture medium was increased to 2 mm to induce terminal differentiation. To inhibit phosphorylation of ERK, 10 μm U0126 (Sigma) was added to the high Ca2+ medium. Recombinant adenovirus encoding Rap1GAPII was obtained from S. Hattori (University of Tokyo). To examine the effect of Rap1 on the phosphorylation of ERK, keratinocytes were infected by adenoviruses encoding Rap1GAPII or β-galactosidase as a control at 24 h before the Ca2+ switch. For the rescue experiment, the plasmid of FLAG-tagged human nectin-1 (amino acids 27–518; pFLAG-CMV1-nectin-1) was transfected into nectin-1–/– keratinocytes using Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pull-down Assay for Rap1 and Ras—The pull-down assay was performed as described (34Fukuyama T. Ogita H. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Yamada T. Sato T. Shimizu K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 815-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In brief, keratinocytes, with or without the Ca2+ switch, were washed with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, lysed in Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate) containing 10 μg of GST fusion proteins, GST-RalGDS-RBD (the Ras binding domain of Ral GDP dissociation stimulator fused to GST) for Rap1, or GST-Raf-RBD+CRD (the Ras binding and cysteine-rich domains of Raf-1 fused to GST) for Ras, and incubated at 2 °C for 30 min. The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 0 °C for 5 min and incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 2 °C for 1 h. After the beads were washed with Buffer B, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using the anti-Rap1 pAb or the anti-Ras mAb. External Appearance in Nectin-1–/– Mice—The external appearance of newborn pups was different between wild-type and nectin-1–/– mice. As shown previously (22Inagaki M. Irie K. Ishizaki H. Tanaka-Okamoto M. Morimoto K. Inoue E. Ohtsuka T. Miyoshi J. Takai Y. Development. 2005; 132: 1525-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), ∼30% of nectin-1–/– pups were born with one or both eyes open. In addition to this phenotype, nectin-1–/– pups had shiny and slightly reddish skin compared with wild-type pups (Fig. 1, A and B). Although this difference in skin tone was apparent at birth, nectin-1–/– mice at postnatal day 7 were indistinguishable from wild-type mice in terms of the external appearance with normal hair coat (data not shown), suggesting that some compensatory mechanisms may exist in the skin. Alternation in Terminal Differentiation of the Epidermis in Nectin-1–/– Mice—To clarify the cause of the skin phenotype of nectin-1–/– newborn mice, epidermal differentiation makers were immunostained. Prior to this, we confirmed the expression pattern of nectin-1 in the epidermis. In wild-type mice, nectin-1 was expressed from the basal layer to the cornified layer, whereas in nectin-1–/– mice, nectin-1 was not observed in the epidermis except for nonspecific staining in the cornified layer (Fig. 2A). The epidermis of the nectin-1–/– mice showed lower expression of loricrin than that of wild-type mice (Fig. 2B), although there was no significant difference in the expression of other differentiation markers, such as keratin 5, keratin 10, involucrin, and filaggrin, between wild-type and nectin-1–/– mice (data not shown). We also determined the expression of each differentiation marker in the epidermis by Western blotting. Consistent with the results from immunofluorescence microscopy, the expression of loricrin was markedly reduced in nectin-1–/– mice (Fig. 2C), whereas those of keratin 5, keratin 10, involucrin, and filaggrin were indistinguishable between wild-type and nectin-1–/– mice (data not shown). It has been shown that nectin is necessary for the recruitment of E-cadherin to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites and is involved in the formation of E-cadherin-based AJs (7Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we then examined whether the expression pattern of E-cadherin is affected in the epidermis of nectin-1–/– mice. The expression pattern of E-cadherin was not changed in the epidermis of nectin-1–/– mice (Fig. 3A). This prompted us to assume that other nectin family members may compensate for the deficiency of nectin-1 in the formation of E-cadherin-based AJs. Therefore, we examined the expression of nectin-2, nectin-3, and nectin-4 in the epidermis. Although the expression of nectin-3 was not detected in wild-type or nectin-1–/– mice (data not shown), the epidermis of wild-type and nectin-1–/– mice expressed nectin-2 (Fig. 3B) and nectin-4 (data not shown) to a similar extent. These results may explain why the formation of E-cadherin-based AJs is not impaired in nectin-1–/– mice. We also examined whether the lack of nectin-1 affects the proliferation ability of the epidermis. To assess this, the epidermis of wild-type and nectin-1–/– mice was stained with the anti-Ki-67 mAb. Ki-67 is a proliferative marker. Staining with the anti-Ki-67 mAb in the epidermis of nectin-1–/– mice was similar to that of wild-type mice (Fig. 3C). The basal layer of wild-type epidermis had 14% Ki-67-positive cells per basal cell, whereas the basal layer of nectin-1–/– epidermis had 16% Ki-67-positive cells. No suprabasal staining with the anti-Ki-67 mAb was observed in either strain of mice. Collectively, these results indicate that nectin-1 plays a role in the regulation of terminal differentiation but not proliferation. Mechanical Property and Barrier Function of the Epidermis in Nectin-1–/– Mice—To test whether the reduced expression of loricrin, a major component of the epidermal cornified cell envelope, in the nectin-1–/– epidermis affects the resistance to mechanical stress, we isolated cornified cells from wild-type and nectin-1–/– mice and exposed them to ultrasound. The morphology of both types of cornified cells was similar before the ultrasound procedure, whereas the cells from nectin-1–/– mice were more severely damaged by ultrasound than those from wild-type mice (Fig. 4), leading to the notion that the nectin-1–/– epidermis is likely to be sensitive to mechanical stress. We then examined whether the cornified layer is functionally intact in nectin-1–/– mice. To assess the permeability of the epidermis, we performed the dye penetration assay using lucifer yellow dye and examined the water loss by measuring their weight in newborn pups (11Tunggal J.A. Helfrich I. Schmitz A. Schwarz H. Gunzel D. Fromm M. Kemler R. Krieg T. Niessen C.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 35Segre J.A. Bauer C. Fuchs E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). No significant difference was observed between wild-type and nectin-1–/– mice in these assays (data not shown). This indicates the presence of the proper barrier function of the epidermis in nectin-1–/– mice. Compensation for the Reduced Expression of the Loricrin Gene in Nectin-1–/– Mice—The loricrin protein contributes to 70–85% of the total protein mass of the cornified layer (36Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 693-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the cornified cell envelope is essential for the barrier function of skin, the reduced expression of loricrin in nectin-1–/– mice was suspected to show an impaired epidermal barrier function, but this was not the case. It has been reported that loricrin–/– mice show congenital erythroderma with shiny skin and have quasinormal cornified cell envelopes (31Koch P.J. de Viragh P.A. Scharer E. Bundman D. Longley M.A. Bickenbach J. Kawachi Y. Suga Y. Zhou Z. Huber M. Hohl D. Kartasova T. Jarnik M. Steven A.C. Roop D.R. J.

In loricrin–/– mice, the expression of other cornified cell envelope components, such as small proline-rich proteins (SPRRPs) and repetin, increases, and this may contribute to the compensatory mechanism preventing barrier dysfunction of the skin.

https://openalex.org/W2094532272,"Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 (TNK1) is a member of the ACK-family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and was originally cloned from CD34+/Lin-/CD38-hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The signaling pathways induced by TNK1 are largely unknown. Here, we report that expression and consequent activation of TNK1 enables tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced apoptosis by selectively inhibiting TNFalpha-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). TNK1 has no effect on NF-kappaB DNA binding or the composition of the NF-kappaB complex; however, the kinase markedly prevents TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB transactivation. TNK1 therefore acts as a novel molecular switch that can determine the properties of TNFalpha signaling and therefore cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1965023321,"The RET gene encodes two main isoforms of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) implicated in various human diseases. Activating germ-line point mutations are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2-associated medullary thyroid carcinomas, inactivating germ-line mutations for Hirschsprung's disease, while somatic rearrangements (RET/PTCs) are specific to papillary thyroid carcinomas. SH2B1β, a member of the SH2B adaptors family, and binding partner for several RTKs, has been recently described to interact with proto-RET. Here, we show that both RET isoforms and its oncogenic derivatives bind to SH2B1β through the SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain and a kinase activity-dependent mechanism. As a result, RET phosphorylates SH2B1β, which in turn enhances its autophosphorylation, kinase activity, and downstream signaling. RET tyrosine residues 905 and 981 are important determinants for functional binding of the adaptor, as removal of both autophosphorylation sites displaces its recruitment. Binding of SH2B1β appears to protect RET from dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases, and might represent a likely mechanism contributing to its upregulation. Thus, overexpression of SH2B1β, by enhancing phosphorylation/activation of RET transducers, potentiates the cellular differentiation and the neoplastic transformation thereby induced, and counteracts the action of RET inhibitors. Overall, our results identify SH2B1β as a key enhancer of RET physiologic and pathologic activities."
https://openalex.org/W2038271699,"The cell wall is important for maintenance of the structural integrity and morphology of fungal cells. Besides β-glucan and chitin, α-glucan is a major polysaccharide in the cell wall of many fungi. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, cell wall α-glucan is an essential component, consisting mainly of (1,3)-α-glucan with ∼10% (1,4)-linked α-glucose residues. The multidomain protein Ags1p is required for α-glucan biosynthesis and is conserved among cell wall α-glucan-containing fungi. One of its domains shares amino acid sequence motifs with (1,4)-α-glucan synthases such as bacterial glycogen synthases and plant starch synthases. Whether Ags1p is involved in the synthesis of the (1,4)-α-glucan constituent of cell wall α-glucan had remained unclear. Here, we show that overexpression of Ags1p in S. pombe cells results in accumulation of (1,4)-α-glucan. To determine whether the synthase domain of Ags1p is responsible for this activity, we overexpressed Ags1p-E1526A, which carries a mutation in a putative catalytic residue of the synthase domain, but observed no accumulation of (1,4)-α-glucan. Compared with wild-type Ags1p, this mutant Ags1p showed a markedly reduced ability to complement the cell lysis phenotype of the temperature-sensitive ags1-1 mutant. Therefore, we conclude that, in S. pombe, the production of (1,4)-α-glucan by the synthase domain of Ags1p is important for the biosynthesis of cell wall α-glucan.

Distinct plasma membrane-localized synthases are responsible for the production of structural polysaccharides in the fungal cell wall, mostly (1,3)-β-glucan, chitin, and α-glucan. (1,3)-β-Glucan and chitin synthases were identified first in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Douglas C.M. Foor F. Marrinan J.A. Morin N. Nielsen J.B. Dahl A.M. Mazur P. Baginsky W. Li W.

Given that cell wall polysaccharides are absent in humans but crucial for maintaining the morphology and structural integrity of fungal cells, inhibitors of the synthases may function as antifungal drugs. For example, caspofungin is a (1,3)-β-glucan synthase inhibitor proven to be effective against many fungi and also safe and well tolerated in humans (6Kartsonis N.A. Nielsen J. Douglas C.M. Drug Resist. Updates. 2003; 6: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). With regard to α-glucan synthase (Ags), 2The abbreviations used are: Ags, α-glucan synthase; SYN, synthase; ORF, open reading frame; TGL, transglycosylase. much less is known, and no inhibitors targeting this enzyme have been developed. The α-glucan synthase Ags1p was identified in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe using a temperature-sensitive mutant strain, ags1-1ts, the cells of which lyse at the restrictive temperature due to a weakened cell wall unable to withstand internal osmotic pressure (7Hochstenbach F.

These observations showed that cell wall α-glucan is an essential component of the S. pombe cell wall. Ags1p is a multidomain protein with two probable catalytic domains predicted to reside at opposite sides of the plasma membrane, as well as a multipass transmembrane domain. This overall domain structure of Ags1p is conserved among the four Ags1p homologs of S. pombe, Mok11p, Mok12p, Mok13p, and (partly) Mok14p, the genes of which are expressed during sporulation (8Katayama S. Hirata D. Arellano M. Pérez P. Toda T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1173-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Notably, this domain structure is also well conserved among Ags1p homologs in other cell wall α-glucan-containing fungi such as several human fungal pathogens in which cell wall α-glucan accounts for ∼35% of the total cell wall polysaccharides. The genome of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus contains three AGS genes, of which AGS1 and AGS3 appear to be directly involved in cell wall α-glucan biosynthesis (9Beauvais A. Maubon D.

For the thermally dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, the virulent yeast form contains substantial levels of cell wall α-glucan, and targeting of its sole AGS gene by RNA interference demonstrated directly that cell wall α-glucan is important for virulence of this pathogen (11Rappleye C.A. Engle J.T. Goldman W.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the opportunistic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, inhibition of expression of its sole AGS gene gives rise to acapsular cells, indicating that cell wall α-glucan plays a role in anchoring the capsule, a critical virulence factor for this pathogen (12Reese A.J. Doering T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Glycogen and starch synthases are glycosyltransferases that catalyze the formation of a (1,4)-α-glucosidic bond and transfer the α-glucose moiety from UDP-glucose or ADP-glucose to the nonreducing end of a pre-existing (1,4)-α-glucan primer. Based on amino acid sequence similarities, these synthases have been divided into two families, family 3 of glycosyltransferases (GT-3, with animal and fungal glycogen synthases) and family 5 of glycosyltransferases (GT-5, with archaeal and bacterial glycogen synthases and plant starch synthases) (13Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar).

Both the N- and C-terminal halves fold into a subdomain with a Rossmann-type fold, a classical structural motif characterized by a central β-sheet flanked by several α-helices. These subdomains are connected by a narrow hinge, creating a deep and wide central cleft between them. It has been proposed that, upon substrate binding, this cleft may close, bringing the nucleotide-glucose-binding motif (Lys/Arg)-X-Gly-Gly (17Furukawa K. Tagaya M. Tanizawa K. Fukui T. J. Biol.

In this study, we focused on the role of the putative intracellular domain of S. pombe Ags1p, denoted here as the synthase (SYN) domain. Our recent observation that cell wall α-glucan from S. pombe consists of ∼10% (1,4)-linked α-glucose residues (19Grün C.H. Hochstenbach F. Humbel B.M. Verkleij A.J. Sietsma J.H. Klis F.M.

Here, we show that fungal Ags SYN domains share several sequence motifs with GT-3 and GT-5 enzymes, including the Glu-X7-Glu motif, the first Glu of which is a highly conserved catalytic residue. Furthermore, we show that (1,4)-α-glucan accumulates in S. pombe cells overexpressing wild-type Ags1p, but not in S. pombe cells overexpressing the mutant Ags1p-E1526A, with the predicted catalytic residue mutated. Together, our data demonstrate that the S. pombe Ags1p SYN domain is involved in cell wall α-glucan biosynthesis by producing (1,4)-α-glucan.

These ORFs were cloned between the XhoI and BglII sites of the pREP4-based vector pAdH006 (34Dekker N. de Haan A. Hochstenbach F. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), generating pAV066, pAV111, and pAV112, respectively. To create pAgs1-ΔTGL, the fragment between the XhoI and SpeI sites in pAV011 was replaced with the Myc epitope tag-encoding hybridization product of oligonucleotides BS013 and BS014, producing pBS010. To create pAgs1-ΔSYN, a KpnI site was introduced in the ags1 ORF of pAV011 through introduction of the silent mutation C3351A following the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) using primers AV219 and AV220, generating pAV127. Then, the fragment between the KpnI and SalI sites in pAV127 was replaced with the Myc epitope tag-encoding hybridization product of oligonucleotides AV221 and AV222, producing pAV128. To introduce defined mutations into the gene fragment encoding the SYN domain, the SmaI-SalI fragment was cloned into the pUC18 vector, and site-directed mutagenesis was performed using primers AV041 and AV042 (K1163Q), AV043 and AV044 (G1165A), AV045 and AV046 (E1526A), AV047 and AV048 (E1534A), or AV051 and AV052 (K1422Q). The SmaI-SalI fragment of pAV011 was replaced with the mutated SmaI-SalI fragments, generating pAV035, pAV036, pAV037, pAV038, or pAV040, respectively. To introduce the temperature-sensitive mutation (G696S) into the gene fragment encoding the TGL domain, the XhoI-EcoRI fragment was cloned into the pUC18-based vector pAdH100, and site-directed mutagenesis was performed using primers BS011 and BS012. The XhoI-SpeI fragment of pAV011 was replaced with the mutated XhoI-SpeI fragment, generating pAV137.

Four microliters of cell suspension (1 × 105 cells) were spotted onto EMMA plates supplemented with or without 10 μm thiamine. Plates were incubated at 28 °C for 3 days and exposed to iodine vapor for 4 min. (1,4)-α-Glucan Determination—Cells (109) were taken up in 5 mm sodium azide and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), broken with acid-washed glass beads using FastPrep 120 (Bio 101, Inc.) at speed 6 for five intervals of 15 s, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6); boiled for 10 min; and centrifuged again. The resulting pellets were washed twice with Milli-Q water and once in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.6) and were divided equally over four fractions. Fractions were resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.6) and incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h in the presence of 1.8 units of α-amylase (catalog no. 102814, Roche Applied Science) and 6.0 milliunits of glucoamylase (catalog no. 1202332, Roche Applied Science), 0.1 unit of Zymolyase 100T (catalog no. 120493, Seikagaku Corp.), all three enzymes, or buffer only. In a control experiment, we confirmed that the amount of enzyme added was sufficient for complete digestion. After digestion, supernatants were collected, and the amount of liberated reducing ends was measured using a colorimetric assay (35Lever M. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The reducing ends were converted to glucose equivalents; the background (buffer-only fraction) was subtracted; and the glucose equivalents/109 cells were corrected for the β-glucan amounts (Zymolyase 100T digestion). Digestion of (1,4)-α-glucan was checked visually for completion by resuspending the remaining pellets in 100 μl of Milli-Q water and adding 900 μl of potassium triiodide reagent prepared from 0.01% (w/v) iodine and 0.1% (w/v) potassium iodide in 5 m calcium chloride. Immunoblotting—Cells (2 × 107) were taken up in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, broken with acid-washed glass beads using FastPrep 120 at speed 6 for three intervals of 15 s, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were washed with ice-cold acetone, resuspended in 200 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Total cell lysates were separated on an SDS-6% polyacrylamide gel (or on an SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel for the α-tubulin control) under reducing conditions; blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schüll); and probed with anti-α-tubulin antibody (catalog no. T-5168, Sigma), mouse anti-Myc tag monoclonal antibody 9B11 (catalog no. 2276, Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-SYN domain antiserum SN269. This anti-SYN domain antiserum was generated in rabbits immunized with peptide H2N-CSQKYGRNSRSRSS-CONH2 (based on residues 1618-1631 of S. pombe Ags1p) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) or horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) and developed by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Complementation Assay—Cells were grown in EMMA medium containing 100 μm thiamine at 21 °C to OD595 ∼ 1.0, washed, and taken up in Milli-Q water to a final concentration of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. Four microliters of cell suspension were spotted in 10-fold serial dilutions onto EMMA plates containing 100 μm thiamine. Plates were incubated at 28 or 36 °C for 3-5 days. β-Glucanase Hypersensitivity Assay—Cells were grown in EMMA medium containing 100 μm thiamine (repression conditions) at 21 °C to OD595 = 1.0-3.0, diluted with fresh EMMA medium containing 100 μm thiamine to OD595 = 0.2, and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were washed once with 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) (digestion buffer) and taken up at OD595 = 0.2 in digestion buffer containing 0.4 units/ml of Zymolyase 20T (catalog no. 120491, Seikagaku Corp.). After a 1-h incubation at 28 °C under continuous shaking, cell lysis was monitored by measurement of the optical density at 595 nm. Phylogenetic Tree of the (1,4)-α-Glucan Synthase Superfamily—Close examination of the putative intracellular domain of S. pombe Ags1p (residues 1091-1986) revealed an N-terminal Lys-rich (19%) region (residues 1091-1144) and a C-terminal Ser-rich (15%) region (residues 1628-1986), both of which flank a domain with amino acid sequence similarities to glycogen and starch synthases, referred to here as the SYN domain (Fig. 1A). The S. pombe Ags1p SYN domain displays ∼26% amino acid sequence identity to the A. tumefaciens and P. abyssi GlgA proteins, the three-dimensional structures of which are known. Besides the genome of S. pombe, the genomes of 14 other ascomycetous fungi and three basidiomycetous fungi are known to encode Ags proteins. Their Ags SYN domains show ∼70% amino acid sequence identity to one another, whereas they show ∼27% identity to established GT-5 synthases, the archaeal and bacterial glycogen synthases and plant synthases (data not shown). To study the phylogenetic relationship of the fungal Ags SYN domains with glycogen and starch synthases, we compared their amino acid sequences using TCoffee (supplemental Fig. S1) and ClustalW (data not shown) and generated phylogenetic trees using the neighbor-joining method (Fig. 1B), as well as FITCH, PUZZLE, and Bayesian analyses (data not shown). Although minor differences were observed in the branching pattern within the major clusters, the mutual relationships among the major clusters were similar. The fungal Ags SYN domains clustered as a monophyletic group within the (1,4)-α-glucan synthase superfamily, relating more closely to other GT-5 synthases than to GT-3 synthases (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the previously described putative catalytic residues of E. coli GlgA and human muscle glycogen synthase are highly conserved in the Ags SYN domains (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the SYN domain may function as a (1,4)-α-glucan synthase.FIGURE 2Conservation of the Glu-X7-Glu motif among fungal Ags1p SYN domains. Shown are the ClustalW alignment and PSIPRED secondary structure prediction for the region flanking the Glu-X7-Glu motif in fungal Ags SYN domains, as well as selected starch synthases and glycogen synthases. Darkgray shading represents predicted β-sheets, and light-gray shading represents predicted α-helices, except for A. tumefaciens (At) GlgA and P. abyssi (Pa) GlgA, the secondary structures of which are known from the solved crystal structure. Dashes indicate identity to the amino acid of S. pombe (Sp) Ags1p in the top line, and boxes indicate the positions of the Glu residues of the motif. The species and synthases included are listed in supplemental Table S1. Note that the first Glu is located in a loop (neither α-helix nor β-sheet), whereas the second Glu is predicted to be part of an α-helix (i.e. α13 in A. tumefaciens GlgA and P. abyssi GlgA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ags1p Overexpression Causes (1,4)-α-Glucan Accumulation—To investigate experimentally whether Ags1p synthesizes (1,4)-α-glucan, we inserted the thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter in front of the ags1+ ORF in the genome of S. pombe wild-type strain 972. This well characterized promoter was chosen because it shows strong promoter activity when cells are grown in the absence of thiamine (induction conditions) (32Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when grown in the presence of thiamine (repression conditions), cells maintain low expression levels of ags1+ sufficient for normal vegetative growth as a result of residual promoter activity (36Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To analyze these Pnmt1-ags1+ cells, we developed a simple plate-based assay for the detection of (1,4)-α-glucan accumulation. Approximately 100,000 cells were spotted onto plates with chemically defined culture medium (EMMA) with or without the addition of thiamine. Following incubation at 28 °C for 3 days, the plates were developed by a 4-min exposure to iodine vapor, which stains (1,4)-α-glucan, either branched (glycogen and starch) or unbranched (amylose). As a positive control, we used cells overexpressing the A. tumefaciens gene encoding GlgA under the control of"
https://openalex.org/W1974724185,"The novel Ca2+-binding protein, Scarf (skin calmodulin-related factor) belongs to the calmodulin-like protein family and is expressed in the differentiated layers of the epidermis. To determine the roles of Scarf during stratification, we set out to identify the binding target proteins by affinity chromatography and subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry. Several binding factors, including 14-3-3s, annexins, calreticulin, ERp72 (endoplasmic reticulum protein 72), and nucleolin, were identified, and their interactions with Scarf were corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization analyses. To further understand the functions of Scarf in epidermis in vivo, we altered the epidermal Ca2+ gradient by acute barrier disruption. The change in the expression levels of Scarf and its binding target proteins were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. The expression of Scarf, annexins, calreticulin, and ERp72 were up-regulated by Ca2+ gradient disruption, whereas the expression of 14-3-3s and nucleolin was reduced. Because annexins, calreticulin, and ERp72 have been implicated in Ca2+-induced cellular trafficking, including the secretion of lamellar bodies and Ca2+ homeostasis, we propose that the interaction of Scarf with these proteins might be crucial in the process of barrier restoration. On the other hand, down-regulation of 14-3-3s and nucleolin is potentially involved in the process of keratinocyte differentiation and growth inhibition. The calcium-dependent localization and up-regulation of Scarf and its binding target proteins were studied in mouse keratinocytes treated with ionomycin and during the wound-healing process. We found increased expression and nuclear presence of Scarf in the epidermis of the wound edge 4 and 7 days post-wounding, entailing the role of Scarf in barrier restoration. Our results suggest that Scarf plays a critical role as a Ca2+ sensor, potentially regulating the function of its binding target proteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner in the process of restoration of epidermal Ca2+ gradient as well as during epidermal barrier formation.

Calcium (Ca2+) is a ubiquitous intracellular messenger that influences numerous cellular processes, such as proliferation, development, and muscle contraction among others. Epidermal differentiation is one of the Ca2+-dependent processes. Mouse keratinocytes cultured in low Ca2+ medium (0.05 mm) proliferate repeatedly, but do not differentiate unless the Ca2+ concentration exceeds 0.1 mm (1Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 2Dykes P.J. Jenner L.A. Marks R. Arch. Dermatol.

Upon the change into the higher Ca2+ concentration, the cultured keratinocytes stop proliferating and begin to differentiate. In vivo, an endogenous Ca2+ gradient is present in the epidermis of neonatal and adult hairless mice (4Menon G.K. Grayson S. Elias P.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 508-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which result from both the intercellular Ca2+ accumulation in the mid granular layers and Ca2+ influx from the upper granular layers, regulate epidermal differentiation. Acute disruption of epidermal permeability by either repeated tape stripping or acetone treatment can alter this Ca2+ gradient in the skin (5Menon G.K. Elias P.M. Lee S.H. Feingold K.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 270: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The responses following skin barrier disruption involve: a loss of Ca2+ from the outer epidermis (stratum granulosum) (6Mauro T. Bench G. Sidderas-Haddad E. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. Cullander C. J.

The Ca2+ concentration in the outer layers of the epidermis decreases 3 h after disruption and is restored after 6-24 h (12Elias P.M. Ahn S.K. Denda M. Brown B.E. Crumrine D. Kimutai L.K. Komuves L.

Mechanisms that lead to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration include the release of Ca2+ from intracellular storages, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Clsp, human calmodulin-like skin protein; rScarf, recombinant Scarf protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. or sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle, as well as Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane using voltage- or receptor-operated channels (13Woodard G.E. Rosado J.A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 65: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 14Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). The majority of released or imported Ca2+ in the cytosol is bound to buffer molecules, including Ca2+-binding proteins (13Woodard G.E. Rosado J.A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 65: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). An essential role for the transduction of the Ca2+ signal is undertaken by the Ca2+-binding proteins, which are characterized by the presence of a helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding motif termed EF-hand. The conformational changes of the EF-hand upon binding of Ca2+ can allow these proteins to interact with a range of specific binding targets and in this way regulate their function (15Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In previous studies, we have reported the characterization of the novel mouse skin-specific Ca2+-binding proteins, Scarf (skin calmodulin-related factor), and Scarf2 (22Hwang M. Morasso M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47827-47833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with their expression patterns being very similar and highly expressed in the differentiated layers of the murine epidermis (22Hwang M.

Patterns. 2005; 5: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here, we have examined the roles of Scarf during the epidermal differentiation process. Seven binding target proteins of Scarf were identified, and their interactions with Scarf were analyzed during epidermal barrier disruption and wound healing. We propose that Scarf plays a critical role as a Ca2+ sensor regulating the function of its binding target proteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner during epidermal stratification and barrier recovery. Scarf and Anti-Scarf Antibody Affinity Chromatography—Recombinant Scarf (rScarf) protein and purified anti-Scarf antibody were immobilized separately on N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The coupling efficiency was 95%, calculated from the ratio of rScarf or anti-Scarf antibody in solution before and after incubation with the matrix of the column. Neonatal mouse epidermis was homogenized in a lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After passing through a 0.22-μm filter, the Ca2+ concentration of the supernatants was adjusted to 2.5 mm before applying onto the columns. Elution was performed using 0.1 n glycine, and the eluted proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE for mass spectrometry analysis. Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were visualized using a colloidal Coomassie Blue staining kit (Invitrogen) (24Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6814) Google Scholar). Visible bands were excised, and proteins were digested with porcine trypsin (Promega) using a MassPREP station (Waters Associates) by a process that included extensive destaining and reduction/alkylation with iodoacetamide. After extraction from the gel pieces, the liquid samples were in vacuo concentrated to ∼12 μl. Liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed using a Waters CapLC system. 6.4 μl of the sample was injected onto a C-18 reverse phase trap column (Optipak Symmetry 300, Waters Associates). After 5 min, the flow was reversed through the trap column, which then coupled to a microbore high performance liquid chromatography column (VC-10-C18w-150, 5 μm, 0.15 mm × 10 cm, Micro-Tech Scientific). Solution A contained 0.2% formic acid and 1% acetonitrile, and solution B was composed of 0.2% formic acid, 1% water, and 98.8% acetonitrile. The gradient was 5% of solution B for 5 min to 35% of solution B by 15 min to 90% of solution B in 25 min. The electrospray was generated by the nebulizing nano-flow accessory, which is available with the interface at a capillary voltage of 3.5 kV. Trapping flow rates were 10 μl/min, and analytical flow rates were ∼1 μl/min. Data-dependent analysis was performed with up to three parent ions of charges 2, 3, 4 in any given departure from direct mass spectrometry measurements, with time and ion count based on control of the length of tandem mass spectrometry data collection. The dynamic exclusion for 30-45 s was included to reduce ion remeasurement. Data were then processed to *.pkl files using the vendor package Masslynx (Waters Associates) with no cut off for tandem mass spectrometry data. Searches were then performed using the Mascot search engine (Center for Information Technology, National Institutes of Health). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Primary mouse keratinocytes were isolated from trypsinized new-born BALB/c mouse skins and lysed by repeatedly freezing and thawing in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were used as the cell extracts after the Ca2+ concentration was adjusted to 2.5 mm. The ProFound co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, each antibody (chicken anti-Scarf, mouse anti-14-3-3σ (Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit anti-14-3-3β (Upstate Biotechnology), mouse anti-annexin II (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-annexin V (Abcam, Inc.), rabbit anti-calreticulin (Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit anti-ERp72 (Stressgen), mouse anti-nucleolin (Abcam, Inc.)) and both IgG and IgY as controls were immobilized onto biosupport medium by amine-coupling chemical reaction. Cell extracts were then incubated with each immobilized antibody for 2 h at 4°C in the presence or absence of 10 mm EDTA. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer in the same conditions. Protein samples were eluted and subjected to Western blot analysis. Phosphate-buffered saline containing both 10% BLOKHen II™ (Aves Laboratories, Inc.) and 5% goat serum was used as the blocking solution to prevent nonspecific binding. The immunoreactive proteins were detected according to the enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (Pierce) using the horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories). Epidermal Ca2+ Gradient Disruption—The epidermal Ca2+ gradient was disrupted in 8-12-week-old hairless mouse skin (from the animal laboratory of Yonsei University) while the animals were under general anesthesia with 4% chloral hydrate administered intraperitoneally and repeatedly tape-stripped on one flank with cellophane tape. The procedure was performed until the transepidermal water loss reached 40 g/m2/h. Untreated sites on the same animals served as controls. Methods for acute barrier disruption and transepidermal water loss measurements have been reported (7Menon G.K. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 279-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 25Grubauer G. Elias P.M. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 323-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescent staining was performed on paraffin sections of adult hairless mouse skin. The deparaffinized sections were treated with a 1:500 dilution (except for rabbit anti-filaggrin antibody, which was used at 1:2000) of the antibodies used in the co-immunoprecipitation analysis overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the sections were incubated with 1:500 dilutions of secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, which included an anti-chicken fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody (Cappel) and an anti-rabbit or mouse rhodamine-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The slides were mounted with Vector Shield (Vector Laboratories) and examined using laser scanning confocal microscope 510 Meta (Zeiss). Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Ionomycin Treatment—Transformed PAM212 primary mouse keratinocytes were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% chelex-treated fetal bovine serum (2Dykes P.J. Jenner L.A. Marks R. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1982; 273: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Hwang M. Morasso M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47827-47833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ca2+ concentration was determined by analysis in an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Unless otherwise indicated, the Ca2+ concentration of the medium was adjusted to 0.05 mm to maintain a basal cell-like population of undifferentiated cells. The open reading frame for Scarf and V5-tagged annexin V (tag at the 3′ end) were cloned into pCMV-Script (Stratagene). Keratinocytes were co-transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 24 h to allow gene expression. Cells were treated with 2.5 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) for 30 min before 4% paraformaldehyde fixation and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Immunofluorescence was performed with anti-Scarf and anti-V5 antibodies as described above. Human Skin Specimens, Wounding, and Histology—Specimens of normal human skin were obtained as discarded tissue following reduction mammoplasty (approved protocol H#25121) and maintained as described previously (26Lee B. Vouthounis C. Stojadinovic O. Brem H. Im M. Tomic-Canic M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1083-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Wounds were created using 3-mm punch biopsies through the reticular dermis, and the specimens were maintained on an air-liquid interface for 4 and 7 days as previously reported (27Stojadinovic O. Brem H. Vouthounis C. Lee B. Fallon J. Stallcup M. Merchant A. Galiano R.D. Tomic-Canic M. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Each time point was collected in parallel with an unwounded skin specimen from the same donor. Samples were fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin-embedded. 7-mm skin sections were cut and stained with anti-chicken Scarf antibody (1:200) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and visualized using an anti-chicken FITC-conjugated antibody (1:250; Cappel). All sections were stained with Hoechst (Sigma) for visualization of the nucleus. All negative controls were prepared by omitting the primary antibody. The sections were analyzed using a Carl Zeiss microscope, and digital images were collected using the Adobe TWAIN_32 program. Identification of Scarf-binding Target Proteins—To determine the roles of Scarf during the epidermal differentiation process, we set out to identify its binding target proteins. Recombinant Scarf (rScarf) protein and affinity-purified anti-Scarf antibody were immobilized separately on N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose beads and used to capture target proteins from neonatal mouse epidermis. The eluted proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel, which was then stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1). The identity of the bands in each preparation was determined by mass spectrometry after a trypsinization process. Binding target proteins identified in rScarf (Fig. 1, rS, left panel) or anti-Scarf antibody (S-Ab, right panel) columns were 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3β, annexin II, annexin V, calreticulin, endoplasmic reticulum protein 72 (ERp72), and nucleolin. The match score and sequence coverage (%), which indicate sequence identity between binding target proteins and trypsinized peptides from the bands of the polyacrylamide gel, are shown in Table 1. Annexin II, calreticulin, and ERp72 were marked with high match score and sequence coverage (%) in both rScarf and anti-Scarf antibody columns.TABLE 1Determination of Scarf binding target proteins interacting by mass spectrometrySample identificationProteinSwiss-Prot accession no.rS-affinityS-Ab affinityMatch scoreSequence coverageMatch scoreSequence coverage%%114-3-3σQ9JJ20661113114214-3-3β143B MOUSE577118103ANX IIANX2_MOUSE30635275194ANX VAQHUP403NDND5CRTS0676339435467386ERp72ISMSER21013242157NUCBAC38858NDND574 Open table in a new tab Ca2+ Affects Scarf-binding Target Protein Interactions—The expression of the seven Scarf-binding target proteins was corroborated in primary mouse keratinocytes by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Cell extracts were prepared from total (T) and suprabasal (S) keratinocytes isolated by Percoll gradient from neonatal mouse skins (22Hwang M. Morasso M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47827-47833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for each binding target protein determined that all of these proteins are expressed in the differentiated layers of mouse epidermis. To verify their interaction with Scarf, co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed with antibodies specific for 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3β, annexin II, annexin V, calreticulin, ERp72 and nucleolin, and cell extracts from primary mouse keratinocytes. Western blot with anti-Scarf antibody confirmed their interaction with Scarf (Fig. 2B). Anti-IgG and anti-IgY antibodies were used as negative controls. The effect of Ca2+ on Scarf-binding target protein interactions was also examined by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 3). Annexin II, annexin V, calreticulin, and ERp72 were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Scarf antibody and visualized by Western blot using previously specified antibodies (Fig. 3A), whereas the interactions of 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3β and nucleolin were verified with Western blots using anti-Scarf antibody after co-immunoprecipitation with each antibody (Fig. 3B). All of these interactions were Ca2+-dependent, because the addition of EDTA abolished or strongly diminished the binding (Fig. 3). The interaction of Scarf with 14-3-3s and nucleolin could only be detected when co-immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies raising the possibility that these proteins might not bind directly to Scarf but form a complex with intermediate molecules that interact Scarf. Localization of Binding Target Proteins and Scarf Expression—Detection of Scarf and binding target proteins was visualized in adult mouse skin sections by immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy (Fig. 4). Scarf was stained with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (first panel), the binding target proteins were detected with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (second panel), and the merged and magnified images appear on the third and fourth panels, respectively. The expression pattern of Scarf is consistent with previous reports (22Hwang M. Morasso M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47827-47833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Hwang M. Kalinin A. Morasso M.I. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2005; 5: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showing that Scarf is expressed in the differentiated layers of the mouse epidermis. 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3β, and annexin V were expressed primarily in granular layers of adult mouse epidermis, whereas calreticulin, ERp72, and nucleolin were expressed throughout the adult mouse epidermis. The merged images and panel with magnified images (Fig. 4, right panel) show the over-lap in expression of the binding target proteins with Scarf in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the epidermal, differentiated layers. Changes in Expression Level and Localization after Alteration of Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration—Acute disruptions of epidermal permeability barrier function by either repeated tape stripping or acetone treatment transiently change the epidermal Ca2+ gradient, inducing a decrease in Ca2+ levels in the outer epidermis (12Elias P.M. Ahn S.K. Denda M. Brown B.E. Crumrine D. Kimutai L.K. Komuves L. Lee S.H. Feingold K.R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To understand the possible function of Scarf and its binding target proteins in the maintenance of the epidermal Ca2+ gradient, we disrupted the epidermal barrier by tape stripping and collected skin samples at 3, 6, and 24 h after the disruption. The change in the expression level of Scarf and its binding target proteins was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot studies using skin sections and cell extracts of samples untreated (control) and after barrier disruption. As shown in Fig. 5A, the expression level of Scarf increased in the granular layers and in the nuclei of cells in the spinous layer 24 h after acute barrier disruption. This change in expression levels is already detected in skin samples obtained 3 and 6 h after barrier disruption (data not shown), with the highest level of change visualized at 24 h after disruption (Fig. 5A). This result suggests that the increase in Scarf expression may precede the recovery of the epidermal Ca2+ gradient following the disruption. In addition, the expression level of annexin II, annexin V, calreticulin, and ERp72 are also increased 24 h after the disruption, whereas the expression levels of 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3β, and nucleolin decrease (Fig. 5). Filaggrin was used as a control, and its expression decreased in these experiments. This is consistent with previous reports that show filaggrin mRNA level decreases after acute barrier disruption and is restored after 6-24 h (12Elias P.M. Ahn S.K. Denda M. Brown B.E. Crumrine D. Kimutai L.K. Komuves L. Lee S.H. Feingold K.R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Distinct changes in the localization of Scarf and some of its binding target proteins were also evaluated. Fig. 6A shows that Scarf and annexin V are both up-regulated and become co-localized at nuclear envelopes and nuclei in the suprabasal layers of the mouse epidermis after acute barrier disruption. Translocation was also observed in transfected mouse keratinocytes. Cells co-transfected with Scarf and annexin V were treated with ionomycin to increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In this setting, both Scarf and annexin V translocate to the nucleus after treatment with ionomycin (Fig. 6B). The results from these two different approaches indicate that the expression of Scarf and some of its binding target proteins is up-regulated and the proteins can be relocated by changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Role of Scarf in Human Skin during Wound Healing—Correlation between skin injury and Ca2+-binding protein function has been reported on studies with S100 proteins, which show that S100A8 and its dimerization partner, S100A9, are strongly up-regulated during wound healing, whereas their expression is very low in normal epidermis (28Thorey I.S. Roth J. Regenbogen J. Halle J.P. Bittner M. Vogl T. Kaesler S. Bugnon P. Reitmaier B. Durka S. Graf A. Wockner M. Rieger N. Konstantinow A. Wolf E. Goppelt A. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35818-35825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether the Scarf human homolog, Clsp, was also up-regulated during wound repair in skin. Normal human skin was wounded by 3-mm biopsy punch and maintained at the air-liquid interface for 4, 7, and 12 days. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of the epidermis at the edge of the wounds utilizing the chicken anti-Scarf antibody that detects the human homolog Clsp (human calmodulin-like skin protein) but shows no cross-reactivity with related Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulin or human calmodulin-like protein (22Hwang M. Morasso M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47827-47833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As expected, we found Clsp/Scarf expression in the granular, differentiated layers of the unwounded human skin (18Mehul B. Bernard D. Simonetti L. Bernard M.A. Schmidt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12841-12847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), similar to mouse epidermis (Fig. 7). Interestingly, 4 days, and even more prominently, 7 days after wounding, Clsp/Scarf expression was increased and expanded through granular and spinous layers of the epidermis (Fig. 7), similar to the epidermis after tape stripping. In addition, we found that Clsp/Scarf localizes to nuclei of the keratinocytes at 4 and 7 days post-wounding, whereas both expression and nuclear presence are restored to the base levels at 12 days post-wounding when the repair process is completed (data not shown). Taken together, we propose that Clsp/Scarf potentially participates in late stages of the wound healing process in epidermis, suggesting a role in epidermal barrier restoration. In eukaryotic systems, Ca2+ ions are crucial in a variety of cellular signaling pathwa"
https://openalex.org/W1985819669,"E2F-1 controls multiple cellular activities through transcriptional regulation of its target genes. As a mediator of cell death, E2F-1 can eliminate latent neoplastic cells through apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which E2F-1 mediates cancer cell killing is largely unknown. In this paper, we report that phosphatase of activated cells 1 (PAC1) phosphatase is a direct transcription target of E2F-1 in signaling apoptosis. We show that ectopic E2F-1 increases expression of PAC1 at both transcriptional and translational levels in breast cancer cells. E2F-1 physically interacts with the promoter of PAC1, binds to its consensus sequence in the promoter and transactivates the PAC1 promoter. E2F-1 suppresses extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation through PAC1 and causes cancer cell death by apoptosis following treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent N-4-hydroxyphenylretinamide (4-HPR). Furthermore, ectopic PAC1 inhibits ERK phosphorylation and mediates cell killing. Moreover, endogenous E2F-1 upregulates PAC1 and suppresses ERK activity, leading to cell death in response to 4-HPR. These results reveal a crucial role of PAC1 in E2F-1-directed apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that E2F-1 mediates apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of PAC1 and subsequent suppression of the ERK signaling. Our findings establish a functional link between E2F-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinases. The E2F-1–PAC1 cascade in cancer cell killing may provide a molecular basis for cancer therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2049160574,"Long term potentiation and long term depression of synaptic responses in the hippocampus are thought to be critical for certain forms of learning and memory, although until recently it has been difficult to demonstrate that long term potentiation or long term depression occurs during hippocampus-dependent learning. Induction of long term potentiation or long term depression in hippocampal slices in vitro modulates phosphorylation of the α-amino-3-hydrozy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid subtype of glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 at distinct phosphorylation sites. In long term potentiation, GluR1 phosphorylation is increased at the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C site serine 831, whereas in long term depression, phosphorylation of the protein kinase A site serine 845 is decreased. Indeed, phosphorylation of one or both of these sites is required for long term synaptic plasticity and for certain forms of learning and memory. Here we demonstrate that training in a hippocampus-dependent learning task, contextual fear conditioning is associated with increased phosphorylation of GluR1 at serine 831 in the hippocampal formation. This increased phosphorylation is specific to learning, has a similar time course to that in long term potentiation, and like memory and long term potentiation, is dependent on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation during training. Furthermore, the learning-induced increase in serine 831 phosphorylation is present at synapses and is in heteromeric complexes with the glutamate receptor subunit GluR2. These data indicate that a biochemical correlate of long term potentiation occurs at synapses in receptor complexes in a final, downstream, postsynaptic effector of long term potentiation during learning in vivo, further strengthening the link between long term potentiation and memory.

Phosphorylation of Ser-845 may also be important for insertion of additional AMPA subtype of glutamate receptor into the postsynaptic membrane (42Malinow R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol.

Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 15Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). For at least one hour after induction of LTP, phosphorylation of GluR1 is increased at Ser-831, whereas during LTD, dephosphorylation of Ser-845 predominates (15Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). When previously potentiated synapses are depotentiated, Ser-831 phosphorylation is decreased (15Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). When depressed synapses are de-depressed, Ser-845 phosphorylation is increased (15Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). These two GluR1 phosphorylation sites have been shown to be required for certain forms of learning and memory in vivo (16Lee H.K. Takamiya K. Han J.S. Man H. Kim C.H. Rumbaugh G. Yu S. Ding L. He C.

Cell. 2003; 112: 631-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar).In an effort to understand whether biochemical correlates of LTP or LTD occur in the hippocampus during learning, we have determined the predominant GluR1 phosphorylation pattern in the hippocampus after a temporally discrete, hippocampus-dependent learning task. Our data reveal a learning-specific increase in Ser-831 GluR1 phosphorylation reminiscent of that seen during LTP of naïve synapses. This increased phosphorylation occurs in heteromeric complexes of GluR1 with GluR2 and is localized to the postsynaptic density (PSD). These data provide additional evidence for LTP-like biochemical changes in the hippocampus occurring at excitatory synapses during learning, providing additional data linking LTP and memory formation in the brain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBehavior—6–8-Week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) housed 4 per cage were handled daily for 5 days in a stereotyped manner before all experiments. Contextual fear conditioning was performed in a manner similar to that previously described (52Powell C.M. Schoch S. Monteggia L. Barrot M. Matos M.F. Feldmann N. Sudhof T.C. Nestler E.J.

After a 2-min habituation period, rats were subjected to three 2-s, 1.5-mA footshocks 1 min apart followed by a 1-min rest period before removal to the home cage. In a separate set of preliminary experiments, freezing behavior (motionless except respirations) was measured by observation every 10 s, and the training protocol was optimized to induce maximal contextual fear memory measured 24 h after training (not shown). In all experiments, sham-trained control rats were subjected to the identical training protocol simultaneously with their randomly chosen, paired, cage-mate but did not receive footshock. For “immediate shock” experiments, rats were placed into the conditioning chambers from their home cage, shocked for 6 s at 1.5 mA, then immediately returned to their home cage. For “latent inhibition” experiments, rats were housed in the conditioning chambers for 16 h with ad libitum access to food and water. One hour before training, food and water were removed for 1 h followed by a standard contextual fear conditioning training protocol described above. Paired, cage-mate, sham control rats were simultaneously treated identically except they received no footshock. In MK-801 experiments, rats were injected intraperitoneally with 0.4 mg/kg MK-801 dissolved in sterile saline (0.4 mg/ml stock) or vehicle alone 30 min before contextual fear conditioning.Sample Preparation—Tissue was collected and processed essentially as described (15Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Rats were euthanized at the indicated time points ± 2–3 min after training by live decapitation. The brain was removed rapidly and submersed immediately into ice-cold dissecting buffer (15Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The left hippocampus was rapidly dissected out, frozen on dry ice, and stored for later use at –80 °C. Whole hippocampi were homogenized in 5 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1/100 dilution Protease Inhibitor Mixture for Mammalian Tissue (Sigma P8340), 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 μm okadaic acid) via sonication with brief pulses for 20–30 s. Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Crude membrane fractions were resuspended in 750 μl of ice-cold 1% SDS with 50 mm NaF and placed at 100 °C for 5 min followed by vortexing and brief sonication. Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad DC protein assay, SDS sample buffer was added, and samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels (4–15% gradient). Samples were paired based on simultaneous experimental and sham control treatment in cage-mate pairs.Immunoblot Analysis—Phosphorylation site-specific GluR1 antibodies were a gift of Dr. Richard Huganir and were generated and purified as described (55Mammen A.L. Kameyama K. Roche K.W. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32528-32533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described (15Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), except secondary antibody was used at 1:20,000, membranes were scanned while wet, and total GluR1 levels were quantified separately by normalizing to actin levels using the bottom half of the same blot with a mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Clone C4, MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). Enhanced chemifluorescent detection afforded a very broad linear range, and all immunoblots were within the predetermined linear range for each antibody (not shown).Postsynaptic Density Preparations—PSD preparations were prepared essentially as described (56Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Bilateral hippocampi were rapidly dissected and homogenized in 5 ml of ice-cold buffer A (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma p8340) in 250 ml). All remaining steps were performed at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1400 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant (S1) was saved. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A and centrifuged 10 min at 700 × g, and supernatant (S1′) was saved and combined with S1. The supernatants were centrifuged at 13,750 × g for 10 min to obtain pellet (P2). P2 was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (0.321 mm sucrose, 6 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 ml protease inhibitor mixture in 50 ml) with 5 strokes of a Teflon/glass homogenizer. The resulting P2 fraction was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (1 ml each of 0.85, 1.0, and 1.15 m sucrose in 6 mm Tris, pH 8.0) that was centrifuged at 82,500 × g for 2 h. The synaptosome fraction (between 1 and 1.15 m sucrose) was collected, the volume was adjusted to 2 ml with buffer B, and 2 ml of buffer C (6 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton-X) was added and rocked gently in a cold room for 15 min. The synaptosome fraction was then centrifuged at 32,800 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was discarded, and pellets were saved as PSD1. PSD1 was suspended in 4 ml of buffer D (6 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton-X) and gently rocked in a cold room for 15 min. PSD1 was then centrifuged at 201,800 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellets were suspended in 70 ml of 1% SDS buffer, subjected to protein assay, and immunoblotting as described above. Using this preparation, the PSD protein PSD-95 was progressively enriched from homogenates to synaptosome to PSD fraction (not shown).Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation of GluR2 was performed essentially as described (57Kjoller C. Diemer N.H. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Bilateral hippocampi were rapidly dissected and homogenized in 1 ml ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, Complete inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science 11 836 170 001), 100 nm okadaic acid, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The detergent Triton X-100 was then added to the final concentration of 1%, and homogenate was incubated at 4 °C with end-over-end incubation for 1 h. Samples were then centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was collected and subjected to protein assay. 2 mg of each sample was incubated with agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h, then centrifuged for 1 min at 3000 × g. Supernatant was removed, and samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation. 5 μg of mouse anti-GluR2 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc. 32-0300) was added to the sample and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. 30 μl of agarose beads were then added to samples and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Samples were then centrifuged for 1 min at 3000 × g, supernatant was removed, and beads were washed with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 3 times. After the final wash, 60 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Samples were then loaded on 4–15% SDS-PAGE gels with the necessary controls, run for 1.5 h at 100 V, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore IPVh00010) for 50 min at 100 V. Blots were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in 1× Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. Blots were then incubated with primary antibodies rabbit phospho-Ser-831 (Chemicon AB5847) and rabbit phospho-Ser-845 (Chemicon AB5849) and actin as above overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed 5 times with 1× Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (0.1%) for 5 min and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Blot were then incubated in enhanced chemifluorescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences RPN5785) for 5 min and imaged by molecular imager (Bio-Rad molecular imager FX). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described above. Blots were then stripped, washed, blocked, and re-analyzed using rabbit total GluR1 (Chemicon AB1504), mouse total GluR2(Zymed Laboratories Inc. 32-0300) antibodies. Control immunoprecipitations performed without antibody or without beads did not pull down GluR2 or GluR1 (not shown).RESULTSWe determined the predominant pattern of GluR1 phosphorylation in rat hippocampus induced during contextual fear conditioning via quantitative immunoblot analysis with phospho-specific GluR1 antibodies. One hour after training in contextual fear conditioning, we observed a statistically significant increase in the ratio of Ser-831 phosphorylation to total GluR1 but no detectable change in the ratio of Ser-845 phosphorylation to total, as compared with sham-trained, paired controls (Fig. 1, A–D). Total levels of GluR1, normalized to actin on the same blots to control for gel loading, were unchanged (Fig. 1, E–H). This pattern of GluR1 phosphorylation 1 h after contextual fear-conditioning training is equivalent to that observed by Lee et al. (15Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) 1 h after induction of LTP in area CA1 of the hippocampus. Thus, the predominant GluR1 phosphorylation pattern in the hippocampus 1 h after fear conditioning resembles that induced during LTP.Although these LTP-like changes in GluR1 phosphorylation are associated with stimuli that induce contextual fear-conditioning learning, it is possible that they are not an effect of learning per se but, rather, are induced by the stress of the unconditioned stimulus, footshock. To control for this, we performed experiments in which animals are subjected to footshock but do not exhibit contextual fear conditioning behaviorally.In the first control experiment (Shock/Remove), animals receive the same unconditioned stimulus (footshock) but do not have time to associate the unconditioned stimulus with the conditioned stimulus (context). Rats were placed in the conditioning chamber and immediately subjected to a footshock of the same total duration and amplitude used to induce contextual fear conditioning followed by immediate removal to their home cage. When contextual memory was tested 24 h after training, Shock/Remove rats do not exhibit significant memory recall compared with traditionally trained, control rats (Fig. 2A). Indeed, the behavior of the Shock/Remove group resembles that of sham-trained rats that have not been shocked at all during training (Fig. 2A). Thus, Shock/Remove training provides a group of animals subjected to footshock without learning the association between the context and the unconditioned stimulus (footshock), although it is likely that some other form of learning takes place in these animals.FIGURE 2Three behavioral experiments in which rats are shocked but do not exhibit contextual learning. A, rats placed into a contextual training chamber, shocked immediately, and removed to the home cage immediately thereafter (Shock/Remove, n = 8) show dramatically reduced contextual fear memory measured 24 h after training compared with traditionally fear-conditioned rats (Fear Conditioned, n = 6). Contextual fear memory of the Shock/Remove group was not significantly different from sham-trained rats that did not receive footshock during training (No Shock, n = 8). B, rats pre-exposed to the training chamber for 16 h before training (Latent Inhibition, n = 7) showed dramatically reduced contextual fear memory measured 24 h after training compared with traditionally fear-conditioned rats that were pre-exposed to a completely different novel context (Shock, n = 8). Contextual fear memory of the Latent Inhibition group was similar in magnitude to sham-trained animals that did not receive footshock (No Shock, n = 8). C, NMDA receptor inhibition with MK-801 30 min before training significantly decreased contextual fear memory measured 24 h after training in a dose-dependent manner.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the second control experiment (Latent Inhibition), rats were pre-exposed to the fear-conditioning chamber for many hours before traditional contextual fear conditioning training. Prior exposure to the context is known to inhibit subsequent associative learning to that particular context, a phenomenon known as latent inhibition. When contextual memory was tested 24 h after training in pre-exposed animals, this group did not exhibit significant memory (Fig. 2B). Control rats pre-exposed to a completely different context then trained in traditional fear conditioning in the fear-conditioning chambers exhibited robust learning (Fig. 2B, Shock). The behavior of the Latent Inhibition group resembled sham-trained rats that were not shocked during training (Fig. 2B). Thus, prior exposure to the context (conditioning chamber) prevents a subsequent aversive conditioning to the context. This allows for yet another group of animals subjected to footshock that do not learn to associate the context with the unconditioned stimulus.Both LTP and contextual fear-conditioning learning are known to be blocked by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. We have replicated the NMDA receptor dependence of contextual fear conditioning to determine whether the learning-induced alterations in GluR1 phosphorylation were dependent on NMDA receptor activation similar to the GluR1 phosphorylation during LTP. The NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocked contextual fear conditioning in a dose-dependent manner as has been previously demonstrated (Fig. 2C) (58Kim J.J. DeCola J.P. Landeira-Fernandez J.

https://openalex.org/W2007579914,"A putative ubiquitin conjugating enzyme known as UBE2Q2 was previously identified in a microarray screen for mitotic regulatory proteins. UBE2Q2 is very similar to another human protein, UBE2Q1 and orthologs from other higher eukaryotic species. In these studies, we demonstrate that UBE2Q2 can covalently bind ubiquitin on the active site cysteine in vitro and show that inhibition of this protein in vivo causes an early mitotic arrest and increased cytotoxicity when cells are treated with microtubule inhibiting agents (MIAs). Changes in cell cycle progression and viability are not observed in the absence of MIA treatment, indicating that UBE2Q2 is involved in the response to MIAs rather than performing a more general function in mitosis. Inhibition of the UBE2Q2 protein causes cells to undergo a prolonged prophase arrest suggesting that UBE2Q2 normally functions to antagonize an early mitotic checkpoint. Furthermore, UBE2Q2 inhibition sensitizes cells to the cytotoxic effects of MIAs through caspase-mediated apoptosis that is correlated with PARP-1 cleavage. These data provide insights into the cellular response to MIAs and demonstrate that inhibition of UBE2Q2 protein function may be useful in the treatment of malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2099455158,"Aromatic amine dehydrogenase uses a tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor to oxidatively deaminate primary aromatic amines. In the reductive half-reaction, a proton is transferred from the substrate C1 toβAsp-128 O-2, in a reaction that proceeds by H-tunneling. Using solution studies, kinetic crystallography, and computational simulation we show that the mechanism of oxidation of aromatic carbinolamines is similar to amine oxidation, but that carbinolamine oxidation occurs at a substantially reduced rate. This has enabled us to determine for the first time the structure of the intermediate prior to the H-transfer/reduction step. The proton-βAsp-128 O-2 distance is ∼3.7Å,in contrast to the distance of ∼2.7Å predicted for the intermediate formed with the corresponding primary amine substrate. This difference of ∼1.0Å is due to an unexpected conformation of the substrate moiety, which is supported by molecular dynamic simulations and reflected in the ∼107-fold slower TTQ reduction rate with phenylaminoethanol compared with that with primary amines. A water molecule is observed near TTQ C-6 and is likely derived from the collapse of the preceding carbinolamine TTQ-adduct. We suggest this water molecule is involved in consecutive proton transfers following TTQ reduction, and is ultimately repositioned near the TTQ O-7 concomitant with protein rearrangement. For all carbinolamines tested, highly stable amide-TTQ adducts are formed following proton abstraction and TTQ reduction.

Aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH) 4The abbreviations used are: AADH, aromatic amine dehydrogenase; MADH, methylamine dehydrogenase; TTQ, tryptophan tryptophylquinone; QM, quantum mechanics; MM, molecular mechanics; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; DCIP, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol; PES, phenazine ethosulfate; MD, molecular dynamics. and the related methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) are inducible periplasmic quinoproteins produced by some Gram-negative bacteria. These enzymes allow growth on primary amines as a source of carbon and nitrogen (1Nozaki M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 650-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 2Chistoserdov A.Y. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2195-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In Alcaligenes faecalis, AADH is specific for phenylethylamines, but also reacts to a lesser extent with primary aliphatic amines (1Nozaki M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 650-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 4Hyun Y.L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MADH is highly specific for smaller amines such as methylamine and ethylamine (3Davidson V.L. Principles and Applications of Quinoproteins. 1993; (Davidson, V. L., ed) pp. , Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York: 73-95Google Scholar). Both enzymes exhibit an α2β2 heterotetrameric structure (α molecular mass 40 kDa, β 12 kDa), with each β-subunit possessing a covalently bound redox-active tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor (4Hyun Y.L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The oxidative deamination reaction proceeds in two steps. In the reductive half-reaction, the TTQ is reduced by substrate leading to incorporation of the substrate-derived amino group into the TTQ cofactor, resulting in conversion of the TTQ from a quinone to N-quinol form (Fig. 1) (4Hyun Y.L.

In the oxidative half-reaction, the TTQ cofactor is subsequently reoxidized by electron transfer to either the periplasmic type I blue copper protein azurin (AADH) or amicyanin (MADH) (6Sukumar N.

Recently, we reported the crystal structures of key intermediates in both the AADH reductive and oxidative half-reactions (8Masgrau L. Roujeinikova A. Johannissen L.O. Hothi P. Basran J. Ranaghan K.

Chem. 2006; 281: 40264-40272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have shown that substrate oxidation is dominated by H-tunneling (intermediate IIIa to IVa in Fig. 1) and occurs via a multistep mechanism involving several proton transfers (IVa to Va) followed by hydrolysis of the Schiff base-reduced TTQ adduct (VIa to VIIa). This results in formation of a S-carbinolamine-TTQ-adduct (VIIa) that is relatively stable. Product release is likely preceded by TTQ oxidation. A significant structural rearrangement is seen in the catalytic subunit upon formation of the N-quinol form (9Roujeinikova A. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40264-40272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This conformational rearrangement influences directly the structure of the AADH-azurin electron transfer complex, and also introduces a water molecule close to the TTQ O-7 hydroxyl group where it can serve as the initial proton acceptor from the O-7 hydroxyl group during the coupled proton and electron transfer to form N-semiquinone AADH. Following oxidation of the N-semiquinone, a new substrate molecule can react with the N-quinone. Alternatively, reaction with substrate can precede the final oxidation step and form an amine-N-semiquinone TTQ adduct prior to TTQ oxidation (9Roujeinikova A. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40264-40272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Despite the detailed knowledge gained for the reaction with tryptamine, several questions remain to be addressed. These include the origin of the water molecule close to the reduced TTQ O-7 and a molecular explanation for the wide range of kinetic parameters (in terms of KIE and reactions rates) with different amine substrates? A major unresolved issue is the structure of the intermediate prior to the H-tunneling step in the enzyme mechanism. Using kinetic crystallography approaches with the AADH/tryptamine system, we report in this paper the discovery of an unusual covalent intermediate that can be explained by assuming reaction with indol-3-aminoethanol, the tryptamine-derived carbinolamine. In the presence of ammonia, the aldehyde products of amine (e.g. tryptamine) oxidation are in equilibrium with the corresponding imine via unstable carbinolamine intermediates. These carbinolamines mimic the original amine substrates in reactions with AADH. In contrast to the generally fast reaction rates observed for primary amines, the inherently slow reaction rates observed for carbinolamines now allow us to address those questions on the AADH amine oxidation mechanism described in the previous paragraph. In this study, we report the crystal structures of key intermediates in the reductive half-reaction of AADH with carbinolamine substrates. We present solution data that characterizes the oxidation reaction with carbinolamines catalyzed by both AADH and the related MADH. Reaction intermediates observed during carbinolamine oxidation support a mechanism for the reductive half-reaction similar to that we have proposed for the oxidation of amine substrates (8Masgrau L. Roujeinikova A. Johannissen L.O. Hothi P. Basran J. Ranaghan K. Mulholland A. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. Science. 2006; 312: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, the rate of carbinolamine oxidation is substantially slower than the corresponding rate of amine oxidation. To provide insight into the structural and energetic changes accompanying proton transfer from, and TTQ reduction by, the reactive AADH-carbinolamine adduct (see Fig. 1 for corresponding reaction with amine substrates), the potential energy surface for the reaction was explored by applying combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods (10Field M.J. Bash P.A. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 700-733Crossref Scopus (2176) Google Scholar, 11Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13967) Google Scholar). Materials—BisTris propane buffer, DCIP (2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol; sodium salt), PES (phenazine ethosulfate; N-ethyldibenzopyrazine ethyl sulfate salt), β-phenylethylamine, tryptamine, benzylamine, phenylacetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and indole-3-acetaldehyde-sodium bisulfite addition compound were obtained from Sigma. Deuterated benzylamine HCl (C6D5CD2NH2 HCl, 99.6%) and deuterated phenylethylamine (C6D5CD2CD2NH2, 98%) were from CDN Isotopes. The chemical purity of the deuterated reagents was determined to be >98% by high performance liquid chromatography, NMR, and gas chromatography, by the suppliers. AADH Crystallization and Crystal Preparation—AADH was purified and crystallized as described previously (8Masgrau L. Roujeinikova A. Johannissen L.O. Hothi P. Basran J. Ranaghan K. Mulholland A. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. Science. 2006; 312: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Crystals of the AADH R-phenylaminoethanol TTQ adduct (intermediate IIIb) were produced by soaking the form A crystals in a stabilizing solution containing 25% PEG MME 2K, 120 mm ammonium sulfate, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm phenylacetaldehyde for 15 min. Crystals of the phenylacetamide and formamide adducts of AADH (intermediate Vc) were produced by soaking the form A crystals in a stabilizing solution that included either 2 mm phenylacetaldehyde or 5 mm formaldehyde for 36 h. Crystals of the oxidized amide-AADH adducts were obtained by soaking the amide-AADH adduct crystals for 5 min in the stabilizing solution supplemented with 50 mm potassium ferrocyanide. Crystals containing tryptamine-derived amide intermediates were obtained by exposure of anaerobically grown form A AADH/tryptamine co-crystals to atmospheric oxygen for several weeks. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data were collected at cryogenic temperatures on ESRF stations ID14-1 and 14-2 (Grenoble, France) and DESY-EMBL station X11 (Hamburg, Germany). All data were processed and scaled using the DENZO/SCALEPACK package (Table 1). Model building and refinement were carried out using the programs TURBO-FRODO (12Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory 86. 1991; (, Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA)Google Scholar) and REFMAC (13Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). High resolution Fourier difference maps unambiguously allowed identification of the species present in the active sites. In all models, hydrogen atoms were included at the last stages of refinement in their riding positions, as implemented in REFMAC.TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statisticsCrystal structureOxygen-exposed tryptamine VIIaPhenylacetaldeyde-derived IIIb-APhenylacetaldehyde-derived VcFormaldehyde-derived VcFerrocyanide-oxidized phenylacetaldehyde Vc (e.g. ∼VIb)Ferrocyanide-oxidized formaldehyde Vc (e.g. ∼VIb)Ferrocyanide-oxidized indol-3-acetaldehyde-derived Vc (e.g. ∼VIb)Resolution range (Å)15-1.05 (1.07-1.05)15-1.35 (1.42-1.35)15-1.4 (1.48-1.40)15-1.4 (1.48-1.40)15-1.4 (1.48-1.40)15-1.45 (1.50-1.45)30-1.6 (1.66-1.60)Completeness (%)84 (73)99 (98)99 (99)99 (99)83 (84)92 (91)88 (90)Observed reflections983,224718,378674,688684,853460,396561,280229,018Unique reflections383,635215,552192,803192,659158,792170,176115,670RmergeaRmerge = Σhkl|Ii — Im|/ΣhklIm, where Im is the mean intensity of the reflection.

Open table in a new tab Purification of Enzymes—AADH was purified from A. faecalis IFO 14479 as described previously (14Hothi P. Khadra K.A. Combe J.P. Leys D. Scrutton N.S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5894-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). MADH was purified from Methylophilus methylotrophus (sp. W3A1) as described (15Davidson V.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Prior to use in kinetic studies, enzymes were reoxidized with potassium ferricyanide and exchanged into 10 mm BisTris propane buffer, pH 7.5, by gel exclusion chromatography. AADH concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 27,600 m–1 cm–1 at 433 nm (5Govindaraj S. Eisenstein E. Jones L.H. Sanders-Loehr J. Chistoserdov A.Y. Davidson V.L. Edwards S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MADH concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 25,200 m–1 cm–1 at 440 nm (15Davidson V.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Aldehyde-dependent Reduction of AADH and MADH—Aldehydes were added to a 1-ml solution containing 5 μm oxidized AADH or MADH, 10 mm BisTris propane buffer, pH 7.5, and 50 mm ammonium sulfate (unless stated otherwise). Following addition of aldehyde, spectra were recorded for at least 24 h using a Varian Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Spectra were analyzed and intermediates of the reaction identified by global analysis and numerical integration methods using SPECFIT/32TM software. Steady-state Analysis—Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed with a 1-cm light path in 10 mm BisTris propane buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C in a total volume of 1 ml. Enzyme activity was measured using a PES/DCPIP-coupled assay system (14Hothi P. Khadra K.A. Combe J.P. Leys D. Scrutton N.S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5894-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Reduction of DCPIP was followed at 600 nm using a PerkinElmer Lambda 5 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Reaction mixtures with the enzyme preincubated in 1 mm phenylacetaldehyde and 50 mm ammonium sulfate typically contained 25 nm (for β-phenylethylamine and tryptamine-dependent reactions) or 50 nm AADH (for benzylamine-dependent reactions), 0.04 mm DCPIP, 5 mm PES, and 500 μm substrate. MADH reactions with formaldehyde typically contained 300 nm MADH. Initial velocity was expressed as micromole product formed per μmol of enzyme per second using a molar absorption coefficient at 600 nm of 22,000 m–1 cm–1 for DCPIP (16Armstrong M.C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 86: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Kinetic Analysis—Rapid kinetic studies were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Experiments were performed by rapid mixing of oxidized AADH or MADH in 10 mm BisTris propane buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm ammonium sulfate, with various concentrations of aldehydes, at 25 °C. Absorbance changes were followed at 456 or 481 nm for AADH and MADH, respectively. Data were analyzed by non-linear least squares regression analysis on an Acorn RISC PC using Spectrakinetics software (Applied Photophysics). For each reaction, at least three replicate measurements were collected and averaged, each containing 1000 data points. Absorbance changes were monophasic, and observed rates were obtained by fitting to the standard single exponential expression. Computational Simulations of the AADH/R-Phenylaminoethanol Adduct—Computational studies of the AADH/R-phenylaminoethanol-derived iminium adduct (IIIb; Fig. 1) were performed based on the corresponding crystal structure, using methods described previously for the AADH/tryptamine system (8Masgrau L. Roujeinikova A. Johannissen L.O. Hothi P. Basran J. Ranaghan K. Mulholland A. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. Science. 2006; 312: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 17Masgrau L.

The final QM/MM solvated system comprised a 25-Å radius sphere centered on the substrate NT iminium atom (see supplementary Scheme 1), containing 7797 atoms, including 3723 waters. The simulations were performed using CHARMM (11Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput.

A. 1998; 201: 4714Crossref Scopus (490) Google Scholar) treatment was applied to link the QM and MM regions where covalent bonds exist, three boundary QM/MM atoms were used in the model, positioned at the Cα carbon atoms of βAsp-128 and of the two modified tryptophans forming the TTQ cofactor. The system was energy minimized, and then equilibrated using 30 ps of PM3/CHARMM22 stochastic boundary molecular dynamics simulation (21Brooks C.L. II I Karplus M. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 6312Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar) (T = 300 K), followed by a production run of 60 ps, using a 1-fs time step and a non-bonded cutoff of 13 Å. Structures were saved every 0.5 ps for subsequent analysis. A potential energy profile for the proton transfer reaction (IIIb to IVb) was calculated starting from the equilibrated structure. A reaction coordinate, ZO2 = [d(C1-H1)–d(O2-H1)], was defined and the system optimized at different values of ZO2, passing from reactant (ZO2 = – 2.7 Å) to product (ZO = 2.2 Å) in 0.05-Å steps. This provided an indication of the 2potential energy change associated with going from IIIb to IVb. The product structure (IVb) was subjected to 60 ps of unrestrained stochastic boundary molecular dynamics. Note that the PM3/CHARMM22 method used here has been found to satisfactorily describe structural properties for these systems (8Masgrau L. Roujeinikova A. Johannissen L.O. Hothi P. Basran J.

To investigate the possible impact of active site water (W-1), which is hydrogen bonded in the crystal structure to O-2, calculation of the potential energy profile was repeated starting from a minimized structure with W-1 deleted (in this case ZO2 = – 2.5 Å corresponded to reactant). To identify catalytically important interactions, energy decomposition analysis was used as described previously (17Masgrau L. Ranaghan K.E. Nigel S. Scrutton N.S. Mulholland A.J. Sutcliffe M.J. J.

Open table in a new tab Atomic Resolution Structure of a Novel Intermediate following the Reductive Half-reaction with Tryptamine—During the reductive half-reaction of AADH with tryptamine, the final S-carbinolamine-reduced TTQ adduct (VIIa; Fig. 1) is highly stable under anaerobic conditions (8Masgrau L. Roujeinikova A. Johannissen L.O. Hothi P. Basran J. Ranaghan K. Mulholland A. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. Science. 2006; 312: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to establish if oxidation of the cofactor leads to product dissociation. This involved exposing anaerobically produced crystals of intermediate VIIa to oxygen in the absence of free substrate to allow for slow oxidation of AADH by oxygen. It was expected that the AADH structure would return to the oxidized resting state following oxidation and product release. However, even after an exposure of several weeks, crystals remained colorless rather than return to the dark-green color as observed for oxidized AADH crystals. Data to atomic resolution (1.05 Å) were collected from these oxygen-exposed intermediate VIIa crystals, revealing a distinct and novel intermediate in both of the active sites present in the asymmetric unit (PDB code 2OIZ, Fig. 2, A and B). Given the high resolution obtained, observed bond lengths and angles were used to unambiguously identify the intermediate present in the first β subunit (denoted chain H) as indol-3-acetamide covalently bound to the TTQ (Fig. 2A). The carbonyl oxygen-carbon bond is bent slightly out of plane with the TTQ system and points toward βAsp-128 O-1. The amide carbonyl oxygen-βAsp-128 O-1 distance (2.5 Å), as well as the electron density and refined bond lengths for βAsp-128, indicate that βAsp-128 O-1 is protonated. The overall conformation of the chain H β subunit is similar to the N-quinol AADH structure (9Roujeinikova A. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40264-40272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with a partially occupied water molecule positioned near the TTQ O-7 atom, indicating that the TTQ is predominantly in the reduced state (9Roujeinikova A. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40264-40272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast, the second β subunit (denoted chain D) remains mainly in the oxidized AADH conformation, presumably as a consequence of crystal packing contacts as observed previously (9Roujeinikova A. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40264-40272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this subunit, the active site electron density is again consistent with nearly full occupancy of the indol-3-acetamide adduct, but in two distinct conformations. The first conformation (accounting for ∼30% of the active site electron density) is similar to that observed in the chain H β subunit, whereas the second conformation (∼40% of the electron density) positions the amide carbonyl oxygen within hydrogen bonding distance of βAsp-128 O-2 and βThr-172 (Fig. 2B). The latter conformation is accommodated in the narrow active site tunnel by rotation of the TTQ along the βTrp-109 Cγ-Cβ bond, turning the C1 group away from βAsp-128. In this case, both the C1-NT as well as the amide carbonyl oxygen-carbon bond are significantly out of plane in comparison to the TTQ, a conformation that is likely only accessible for the reduced amide adduct (see below). The remainder of the electron density corresponds to the uncomplexed quinone state (i.e. resting state) of the enzyme. Given the presence of multiple species in this active site, the protonation state of βAsp-128 cannot be assessed. Reaction with Carbinolamines Leads to Formation of Amide-TTQ Covalent Adducts—Two alternative mechanisms can be considered that lead to formation of an amide-TTQ adduct during the reaction of AADH with aromatic amines. The first putative mechanism assumes that, following oxidation of the S-carbinolamine species VIIa (observed during the reductive half-reaction with amines (8Masgrau L. Roujeinikova A. Johannissen L.O. Hothi P. Basran J. Ranaghan K. Mulholland A. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. Science. 2006; 312: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar)), the enzyme succeeds in oxidizing the bound S-carbinolamine via a second H-transfer rather than releasing the product. However, in contrast to the first H-transfer, βAsp-128 is incorrectly positioned to act as proton acceptor, given that the remaining proton is positioned on the opposite side of C1. In the second putative mechanism"

We report here that PML-RARα acquires aberrant association with coactivators. We show that endogenous PML-RARα interacts with the histone acetyltransferases CBP, p300, and SRC-1 in a hormoneindependent manner, an association not seen for RARα. This hormone-independent coactivator binding activity requires an intact ligand-binding domain and the NR box of the coactivators. Confocal microscopy studies demonstrate that exogenous PML-RARα sequesters and colocalizes with coactivators. These observations correlate with the ability of PML-RARα to attenuate the transcription activation of the Notch signaling downstream effector, CBF1, and of the glucocorticoid receptor. This includes attenuation of the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) and FLJ25390 target genes of the endogenous glucocorticoid receptor. Furthermore, treatment of NB4 cells with all-trans-retinoic acid, which promotes PML-RARα degradation, resulted in increased activation of GILZ. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model in which the hormone-independent association between PML-RARα and coactivators contributes to its ability to regulate gene expression.

RARs are members of the nuclear receptor family that controls processes such as development, differentiation, and homeostasis through regulation of complex gene networks. RARs form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and bind to DNA sequences harboring direct repeats, (A/G)G(G/T)TCA, separated by 5 bp. Transcription regulation by RXR/RAR heterodimers involves the exchange of corepressor and coactivator complexes, which are controlled by the hormone binding status of the receptor (11Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar, 12Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M.

Unliganded RXR/RAR heterodimers bind corepressor complexes to inhibit transcription, whereas hormone-bound RXR/RAR heterodimers dissociate from the corepressors and concomitantly recruit the coactivator complexes, leading to transcription activation. The best known corepressors include SMRT and the nuclear receptor corepressor, which form complexes with mSin3A and histone deacetylases (13Li J. Wang J. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J. Wong J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 14Jones P.L. Sachs L.M. Rouse N. Wade P.A. Shi Y.B. J. Biol.

The coactivators include members of the p160 family, SRC-1, ACTR/RACK1/pCIP/SRC-3, and TIF2/GRIP1, as well as the potent histone acetyltransferases PCAF and p300/CBP (15Yao T.P. Ku G. Zhou N.

In contrast to the action of histone deacetylases, histone acetyltransferases acetylate histone tails, resulting in weaker associations of histones with chromatin and creating a local environment conducive for binding of the general transcription machinery to the target promoter. These notions are consistent with the observations that histone acetylation is linked to transcription activation and that deacetylation is associated with transcription repression. Molecular and structural studies of the nuclear receptor ligand-binding domain (LBD) of RXRα indicate that, in the absence of hormone, helix 12 of the LBD is held in a position extended away from the rest of the LBD (23Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this conformation, corepressors bind receptors via a common motif, (I/L)XX(I/V)I (where X is any amino acid), which is known as the CoRNR box (24Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 25Nagy L. Kao H.-Y. Love J.D. Li C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W.

Hormone binding induces a conformational change in which helix 12 folds back to contact helixes 3-5 of the LBD (23Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Consequently, such conformational changes result in dissociation of the corepressors and recruitment of the coactivators via the LXXLL motif present in the coactivators (28Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 29Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J.

It has been proposed that these consensus motifs signify a common mechanism of transcription regulation throughout the nuclear receptor family members. The mechanisms underlying transcription regulation by PML-RARα appear to be more complex than those of RXRα/RARα heterodimers. In vitro studies have shown that, in addition to its ability to form heterodimers with RXRα, PML-RARα is capable of forming homodimers (30Jansen J.H. Mahfoudi A. Rambaud S. Lavau C. Wahli W. Dejean A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7401-7405Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Perez A. Kastner P. Sethi S. Lutz Y. Reibel C. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3171-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) that bind corepressors more tightly than does RXRα/RARα and that require retinoic acid concentrations higher than physiological levels to dissociate from corepressors (≥1 μm) (2de The H. Lavau C. Marchio A. Chomienne C. Degos L. Dejean A. Cell. 1991; 66: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 5Kakizuka A. Miller Jr., W.H. Umesono K. Warrell Jr., R.P.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3171-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Therefore, at physiological concentrations of retinoic acid (10-100 nm), PML-RARα acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of RARs, leading to a constitutive repression of RAR target genes. This model is supported by transient transfection assays, in which PML-RARα can potently repress transcription when it is tethered to the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain (32Lin R.J. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). There is also evidence suggesting that PML-RARα can promote formation of a heterochromatin-like structure to keep target genes repressed through recruitment of histone methyltransferases such as SUV39H1 (33Carbone R. Botrugno O.A. Ronzoni S. Insinga A. Di Croce L. Pelicci P.G. Minucci S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1288-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, there is no in vivo evidence to suggest that PML-RARα homodimers compete with RXRα/RARα for DNA binding. Furthermore, recent reports suggested that overexpression of PML-RARα leads to a reduction of nuclear receptor corepressor protein levels (34Khan M.M. Nomura T. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Yoshida H. Mori K. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11814-11824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Ng A.P. Howe Fong J. Sijin Nin D. Hirpara J.L. Asou N. Chen C.S. Pervaiz S. Khan M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9903-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Likewise, other studies have indicated that, in the absence of hormone, PML-RARα activates retinoic acid response element-mediated reporter activity in the absence of retinoic acid (36Kogan S.C. Hong S.H. Shultz D.B. Privalsky M.L. Bishop J.M. Blood. 2000; 95: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hauksdottir H. Privalsky M.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 85-98PubMed Google Scholar). This differential regulation of transcription is likely promoter- and cell type-specific; however, it highlights the fact that a simple model of constitutive repression of RARα target genes by PML-RARα is not sufficient to explain all of its possible roles in transcription regulation. Although the aberrant association of PML-RARα with corepressors is well characterized, interactions with coactivators have not been well explored, although one study with NPM-RARα suggests that this fusion protein may interact with coactivators in an aberrant manner compared with wild-type RXR/RARα (38Dong S. Qiu J. Stenoien D.L. Brinkley W.R. Mancini M.A. Tweardy D.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 858-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that PML-RARα homodimers acquire the ability to interact with coactivators in a hormone-independent manner. Consistent with these data, we found that ectopic expression of PML-RARα in the absence of hormone is able to induce mislocalization of some coactivators to a non-nuclear compartment. We also found that overexpression of PML-RARα decreases transcription activation by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and CBF1. In light of these findings, we propose a distinct mechanism by which PML-RARα regulates transcription not only as a repressor of RARα target genes, but as a factor capable of repressing the activation of a subset of genes whose activation relies on coactivator recruitment.

For transfection, 7-10 × 106 cells were spun down and resuspended in 200 μl of Opti-MEM I. 60 μg of hemagglutinin (HA)-PML-RARα expression plasmid was added, and the mixture was placed into a 0.2-mm gap electroporation cuvette. The cells were electroporated with a 140-V square-wave pulse for 0.25 ms using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser system.

Lysates were made using NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) and lysed by sonication. The resulting lysates were immunoprecipitated in NETN buffer for 4 h with 4 μg of antibody (anti-RARα (C-20), anti-SRC-1 (M-341), anti-p300 (N-15), or anti-CBP (A-22); Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The immunoprecipitated complexes were resolved by SDSPAGE and immunoblotted overnight with the antibodies indicated in Fig. 4 (anti-RARα, anti-SRC-1, anti-p300, anti-CBP, or anti-PML (H-238)) at a 1:500 dilution in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/Tween 20 at 4 °C. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA composed of pCMX-FLAG-PCAF, pCMX-FLAG-ACTR, pCMX-HA-PML-RARα, pCMX-RARα, or pCMX alone using Lipofectamine 2000 following the published protocol from Invitrogen. 48 h transfection, whole cell lysates were made using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) plus protease inhibitors and then immunoprecipitated in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer using red anti-FLAG antibody M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 4 h at 4°C.The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG (Sigma) and HA-conjugated anti-horseradish peroxidase (Roche Applied Science) antibodies (1:1000 dilution in 1× PBS/Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature). The corresponding secondary antibodies were used, and visualization of the products was done using an ECL detection kit (Pierce). For immunoprecipitations done in the presence of hormone, cells were grown for 12 h in medium with charcoal-stripped serum supplemented or not with 1 μm ATRA. ATRA was also included in the immunoprecipitation reactions and wash buffer at the same concentration. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—CV-1 and HL-60 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid of HA-PML-RARα. Transfected cells were grown in medium containing stripped serum for an additional 24-48 h. For immunofluorescence microscopy, transfected cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 1× PBS with the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum for 10 min. The cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and incubated in a solution of PBS, 10% goat serum, and 0.1% Tween 20 (buffer A) for 60 min. Incubation with primary antibodies was carried out for 120 min in buffer A. The cells were washed three times with 1× PBS, and the secondary antibodies were added for 30-60 min in the dark at room temperature in buffer A. Coverslips were mounted on slides using VECTASHIELD mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (H-1200, Vector Laboratories). Imaging was performed on a Leica Model DMLB microscope, and pictures were taken with a SPOT camera using SPOT Advanced software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.).

Confocal Microscopy—All confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted laser-scanning confocal microscope. A ×63 numerical aperture of a 1.4 oil immersion Plan Apochromat objective was used for all experiments. To investigate the localization of transiently transfected HA-PML-RARα, images of Alexa Fluor 488 were collected using a 488-nm excitation light from an argon laser, a 488-nm dichroic mirror, and 500-550-nm band pass barrier filter. For endogenous coregulator anti-SRC-1, anti-CBP, and anti-p300 antibodies, images of Alexa Fluor 594 were collected using a 633-nm excitation light from a He/Ne2 laser, a 633-nm dichroic mirror, and 650-nm long pass filter. All 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclear images were collected using a Coherent Mira-F-V5-XW-220 (Verdi 5W) Ti-sapphire laser tuned at 750 nm, a 700-nm dichroic mirror, and a 390-465-nm band pass barrier filter. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pulldown Assays—For GST pulldown assays, in vitro translated HA-RARα, HA-PML, HA-PML-RARα, HA-PLZF-RARα, or HA-PLZF was incubated for 30 min on a nutator at room temperature with GST-tagged ACTR receptor interaction domain (RID)-conjugated glutathione-Sepharose beads in NETN buffer with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) in the presence or absence of ATRA (10-1000 nm). After incubation, the beads were washed three times with NETN buffer and collected by centrifugation. The proteins were eluted and denatured by placing the samples at 100 °C for 5 min and then run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The products were visualized by Western blot analysis with HA-conjugated anti-horseradish peroxidase antibody. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—A549 cells were transfected with HA, HA-PML-RARα, or HA-PML-RARα(F584A) using Lipofectamine 2000. Where indicated, samples were treated for 16-20 h with 1 μm dexamethasone before harvesting. One-third of the cells were used to make whole cell lysates using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer plus protease inhibitors. The other two-thirds of the cells were used for RNA isolation. NB4 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in 7% CO2. They were either left untreated or treated alone or in combination with 1 μm ATRA for 72 h and 1 μm dexamethasone for 16-18 h. RNA isolation was performed using an RNeasy mini RNA isolation kit (Qiagen Inc.). All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNase I digestion was performed on an RNeasy column following the manufacturer's protocol using RNase- and DNase-free DNase I (Qiagen Inc.). The isolated RNA was used in a semiquantitative RT-PCR using a one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of RNA template was used in each reaction, and PCR amplification was repeated for 40 cycles. The final primer concentration in each reaction was 0.2 μm. Each assay was performed at least three times. The actin primers used as a control were 5′-ggtctcaaacatgatctgggtc-3′ (forward) and 5′-aaatctggcaccacaccttc-3′ (reverse). The GR target gene primers used were as follows: glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), 5′-agatcgaacaggccatggat-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttacaccgcagaaccaccag-3′ (reverse); and FLJ25390, 5′-ggctcatgctggatgacaa-3′ (forward) and 5′-cccagatggtggagatcagt-3′ (reverse). 4K. R. Yamamoto and A. So, personal communication. The observations that PML-RARα requires higher concentrations of hormone to dissociate from corepressors and that both corepressor- and coactivator-binding domains overlap in the modeled nuclear receptor LBD suggested that PML-RARα may interact with both sets of coregulators differently from wild-type RARα (23Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we characterized the association of PML-RARα with coactivators in solution by GST pulldown experiments. A fusion protein composed of GST attached to the RID of SMRT or ACTR was expressed and purified from bacteria. Purified immobilized GST-SMRT-(RID) or GST-ACTR(RID) fusion protein was incubated with in vitro transcribed and translated RARα, PML, or PML-RARα in the presence and absence of hormone. To our surprise, PML-RARα could be pulled down by GST-ACTR(RID) in both the presence and absence of hormone (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). No binding was observed with any of the proteins to GST alone. In contrast and as expected, RARα was able to bind to ACTR in a DNA-independent manner, but only after the addition of hormone (Fig. 1B, lane 4 versus lane 5). Also, PML was unable to bind to GST-ACTR(RID) regardless of the presence of hormone (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5). As a control, Fig. 1D shows that the association of PML-RARα with SMRT in this assay is consistent with the well documented association, which requires 1 μm ATRA to induce complete dissociation (lanes 3-5). These results suggest that PML-RARα binds coactivators in solution in both the absence and presence of hormone. To investigate the molecular basis of the hormone-independent association between PML-RARα and coactivators, we performed yeast-two hybrid assays. The yeast Gal4 activation domain (pGAD) was fused to the LBD of RARα, PML, or PML-RARα, whereas ACTR(RID) was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (pGBT9). The constructs were cotransformed into yeast. The interaction of ACTR(RID) and PML-RARα was assayed by measuring β-galactosidase expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, as controls, coexpression of the pGBT9 vector alone and pGAD-PML-RARα or pGBT9-ACTR(RID) and the pGAD vector alone resulted in only basal reporter activity. Moreover, coexpression of pGBT9-ACTR(RID) and pGAD-PML did not activate reporter activity in the presence or absence of hormone. As expected, coexpression of pGBT9-ACTR(RID) and pGAD-RARα(LBD) resulted in activation of the reporter only in the presence of hormone. However, consistent with our in vitro protein-protein interaction data (Fig. 1), coexpression of pGBT9-ACTR(RID) and pGAD-PML-RARα led to a potent activation of reporter activity in the absence of hormone, indicating a strong a"
