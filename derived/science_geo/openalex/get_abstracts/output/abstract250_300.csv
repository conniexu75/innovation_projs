https://openalex.org/W2023468449,"Sensitization is an elementary form of nonassociative learning, related to behavioral arousal, in which a strong stimulus facilitates a reflex response. Studies of the neural circuit of the gill-withdrawal reflex in the isolated abdominal ganglion on Aplysia indicate that short-term sensitization is due to presynaptic facilitation. The facilitation results in a sudden increase in the amount of neurotransmitter released by the sensory neurons at their synapses with motor neurons."

This transition is accompanied by a 40- to 50-fold rise in the incorporation of [14C]acetate into triglyceride. The increase in lipogenic rate is exactly parallel to a coordinate rise in the activities of the key enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthetase). Immunological studies indicate that the elevated acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity is the product of an increased cellular enzyme level."

The results suggest that changes in the density of adrenergic receptors are involved in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced supersensitivity at central noradrenergic synapses."

In this report, we describe some properties of these receptors after their solubilization from rat liver nuclei and their separation from nucleic acids and basic proteins. The nuclear extract and partially purified preparations contain a dominant class of binding sites which have a high affinity for triiodothyronine (3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine, Kd approximately 1 nM) and for the biologically potent isopropyl diiodothyronine (3,5-diiodo-3'-isopropyl-L-thyronine, Kd congruent to 1 nM) and also bind thyroxine (3,5,3',5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine, Kd approximately 5 nM) and reverse triiodothyronine (3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine, Kd approximately nM). This binding activity elutes on Sephadex G-100 in an included peak which has a Stokes radius of 35 A and sediments on glycerol gradients at 3.5 S. From these data a molecular weight ratio of 50,500 and a frictional ratio of 1.4 were calculated, suggesting that the receptor is somewhat asymmetrical. There was a sharp decline in triiodothyronine binding by this component above pH 8.7 (optimum around pH 7.6) where there is marked dissociation of the 4' phenolic hydroxyl of triiodothyronine (pKalpha approximately 8.5). A similar decrease in thyroxine (pKalpha approximately 6.7) binding with pH increases in this range was not observed. Thus, ionization of the phenolic hydroxyl may influence binding. The solubilized preparations can also contain a minor specific-binding component that can be identified by binding analyses, and by G-100 or quaternary aminoethyl Sephadex chromatography. this component has a much lower affinity for triiodothyronine and isopropyl diiodothyronine than for thyroxine as compared to the major component. It probably has a pH optima around 6.0 and demonstrates and apparent tendency to aggregate. The minor component was not always identified by direct Scatchard analysis and may be generated in part from the major component as it was more commonly observed after storage or purification of the nuclear extract. Thus, at least two thyroid hormone-binding components can be present in extracts of purified rat liver nuclei; the minor component may be an altered form or subunit of the major component. The relative binding activities of triiodothyronine, isopropyl diiodothyronine, and thyroxine by the major component, similar to those in intact nuclei, parallel the biological potencies of these compounds, and suggest that the dominant binding is by biologically relevant receptors. Since ionization of the phenolic hydroxyl may influence binding, the lower activity of thyroxine relative to triiodothyronine may in part be due to the fact that at physiological pH, the phenolic hydroxyl of thyroxine is more dissociated than is that of triiodothyronine. The finding that this receptor is somewhat asymmetrical provides an indication of the shape of an intrinsic chromatin protein implicated in specific gene regulation..."

https://openalex.org/W1584138159,"A 37,000 X g supernatant fraction prepared from fat lung homogenate demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in guanylate cyclase activity after incubation at 30 degrees for 30 min (preincubation). Treatment of the supernatant fraction with Triton X-100 increased activity to approximately the same extent as preincubation, but would not increase the activity after preincubation. By chromatography on Sepharose 2B, before and after preincubation, it was demonstrated that the increase in activity was only associated with the soluble guanylate cyclase, and not the particulate enzyme. Activation by preincubation required O2. It was completely inhibited by thiols such as 2-mercaptoethanol, and by bovine serum albumin, KCN, and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. These inhibitors suggested a copper requirement for activation, and this was confirmed by demonstrating that 20 to 60 muM CuCl2 could relieve the inhibition by 0.1 mM sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. 2-Mercaptoethanol inhibition could also be reversed by removal of the thiol on a Sephadex G-25 column, however, this treatment partially activated the enzyme. Addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to a preincubated preparation would not reverse the activation. H2O2 was found to activate guanylate cyclase, either by its generation in the lung supernatant with glucose oxidase and glucose, or by its addition to a preparation in which the catalase was inhibited with KCN. KCN or bovine serum albumin was able to partially inhibit activation by glucose oxidase plus glucose, however, larger amounts of glucose oxidase could overcome that inhibition, indicating a catalytic role for Cu2+ at low H2O2 concentrations. No direct evidence for H2O2 formation during preincubation could be found, however, indirect evidence was obtained by the spectrophotometric detection of choleglobin formation from hemoglobin present in the lung supernatant fluid. The H2O2 is believed to result from the reaction of oxyhemoglobin with ascorbate."

This response can be blocked by atropine, a muscarinic antagonist. These findings indicate that choline-induced increases in acetylcholine concentrations may be associated with parallel changes in the amount of the neurotransmitter released into synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1540393326,"A transglutaminase from human hair follicle-free epidermis was purified to homogeneity using gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The enzyme had an apparent Mr = 51,000 +/- 2,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, 100,000 +/- 5,000 by discontinuous gel electrophoresis, and 50,000 +/- 2,000 by gel filtration in Bio-Gel A-0.5m agarose. The enzyme cross-linked Factor XIII-free fibrinogen forming gamma dimers and alpha polymers. Either calcium or strontium was necessary for enzyme activity. In the presence of calcium, enzyme activity was increased by heating at 56 degrees or by treating with dimethylsulfoxide. Activation required calcium and occurred in the presence of serine protease inhibitors. The activated and native enzyme had apparently identical mobilities in acrylamide disc electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. The Km values for two substrates in the reaction, casein and putrescine, were very similar for the native and the activated enzyme. The activated enzyme had a larger elution volume on Bio-Gel A-0.5m in the presence of calcium than did the native enzyme. The detailed mechanism of activation remains to be determined."

https://openalex.org/W1511869459,"Chloroplast NADP-linked glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was resolved into three forms that differed in molecular weight: (a) larger than or equal to 1.5 million; (b) 600,000; and (c) less than or equal to 100,000. After preincubation with an effector (ATP, NADPH, or Pi) the activity of forms a and c was unaffected, whereas the activity of b, the regulatory form, was increased 10-fold. Activation was accompanied by the exposure of previously hidden sulfhydryl groups. The rate of activation was slower than the rate of catalysis and resulted in a lag phase during the measurement of activity when the enzyme was preincubated in the absence of an effector. The addition of one of several compounds as a second effector (at a concentration which itself was nonactivating) in the presence of a first effector enhanced activation by lowering the concentration of the first effector required for half-maximal activation (Pi constant/ATP or NADPH varied; ATP or NADPH constant/Pi varied). Other combinations of effectors caused little change in activity (ATP constant/NADPH varied; NADPH constant/ATP varied). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate added as a second effector induced contrasting changes: an increase in the ATP-mediated activation and a decrease in the NADPH-mediated activation. The results are consistent with the view that the products of the photochemical reactions of chloroplasts, ATP, and NADPH, in conjunction with other metabolites, regulate the activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2."
https://openalex.org/W2413138043,"The mitochondrial H+/site ratio (i.e. the number of protons ejected per pair of electrons traversing each of the energy-conserving sites of the respiratory chain) has been evaluated employing a new experimental approach. In this method the rates of oxygen uptake and H+ ejection were measured simultaneously during the initial period of respiration evoked by addition of succinate to aerobic, rotenone-inhibited, de-energized mitochondria. Either K+, in the presence of valinomycin, or Ca2+, was used as mobile cation to dissipate the membrane potential and allow quantitative H+ ejection into the medium. The H+/site ratio observed with this method in the absence of precautions to inhibit the uptake of phosphate was close to 2.0, in agreement with values obtained using the oxygen pulse technique (Mitchell, P. and Moyle, J. (1967) Biochem. J. 105, 1147-1162). However, when phosphate movements were eliminated either by inhibition of the phosphate-hydroxide antiporter with N-ethylamaleimide or by depleting the mitochondria of their endogenous phosphate content, H+/site ratios close to 4.0 were consistently observed. This ratio was independent of the concentration of succinate, of mitochondrial protein, of pH between 6 and 8, and of ionic composition of the medium, provided that sufficient K+ (plus valinomycin) or Ca2+ were present. Specific inhibitors of the hydrolysis of endogenous ATP or transport of other ions (adenine nucleotides, tricarboxylates, HCO3-, etc.) were shown not to affect the observed H+/site ratio. Furthermore, the replacement of succinate by alpha-glycerol phosphate, a substrate which is oxidized on the outer surface of the inner membrane and thus does not need to enter the matrix, gave the same H+/site ratios as did succinate. It is concluded that the H+/site ratio of mitochondrial electron transport, when phosphate movements are eliminated, may be close to 4.0."
https://openalex.org/W1489233161,"Under conditions used previously for demonstrating glycolytic oscillations in muscle extracts (pH 6.65, 0.1 to 0.5 mM ATP), phosphofructokinase from rat skeletal muscle is strongly activated by micromolar concentrations of fructose diphosphate. The activation is dependent on the presence of AMP. Activation by fructose diphosphate and AMP, and inhibition by ATP, is primarily due to large changes in the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the substrate fructose 6-phosphate. These control properties can account for the generation of glycolytic oscillations. The enzyme was also studied under conditions approximating the metabolite contents of skeletal muscle in vivo (pH 7.0, 10mM ATP, 0.1 mM fructose 6-phosphate). Under these more inhibitory conditions, phosphofructokinase is strongly activated by low concentrations of fructose diphosphate, with half-maximal activation at about 10 muM. Citrate is a potent inhibitor at physiological concentrations, whereas AMP is a strong activator. Both AMP and citrate affect the maximum velocity and have little effect on affinity of the enzyme for fructose diphosphate."

An overall yield of pure L-asparaginase of 40 to 45% and a specific activity of 200 +/- 2 IU per mg of protein was obtained. The pure enzyme can be stored at -20 degrees for at least 3 months with no loss of activity. The isoelectric point of the L-asparaginase is 8.74. No carbohydrate, phosphorus, tryptophan, disulfide, or sulfhydryl groups were detected. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 146,000 and a subunit weight of approximately 37,000. The Km of the enzyme for L-asparagine is 4.78 X 10(-5) M and the pH optimum of the L-asparaginase reaction is 7.3. D-Asparagine was hydrolyzed at 6.5% of the rate found with the L isomer. L-Glutamine and a variety of other amides were not hydrolyzed at significant rates; the activity of the enzyme for L-glutamine was 130- to 600-fold less than that of other therapeutically effective L-asparaginases of bacterial origin. The L-asparaginase from V. succinogenes is immunologically distinct from the L-asparaginase (EC-2) of Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1516751460,"A type I absorbance change is observed in suspensions of adrenal cortical mitochondria as the temperature is increased from 0-22 degrees. This type I absorbance change is similar in magnitude to the pregnenolone-induced type II absorbance change of these mitochondria. Studies with inhibitors of cholesterol side chain cleavage indicate that the heat-generated type I absorbance change represents the specific interaction of cytochrome P-450scc with endogenous cholesterol in the mitochondria. This finding is confirmed by low temperature EPR spectroscopy on temperature-equilibrated, quick frozen adrenal mitochondrial samples. The EPR resonance at g = 8.2, which is that of the high spin cholesterol-bound cytochrome P-450scc, is absent in the samples incubated at 0 degrees and increases in magnitude with increasing temperature of incubation. Studies of the pH dependence of the heat-generated type I and pregnenolone-induced type II absorbance changes reveal that both are diminished by increasing pH over the range 6 to 8. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment of rats results in adrenal mitochondria which show a greatly increased heat-generated type I absorbance change. The latter correlates with an increased pregnenolone-induced type II absorbance change and increased EPR g = 8.2 signal. Prior treatment of animals with cycloheximide eliminated the ACTH-induced increase in the heat-generated type I absorbance change, the pregnenolone-induced type II absorbance change and the EPR g = 8.2 signal. We estimate that the hydrophobic bonding of cholesterol to cytochrome P-450scc occurs with a deltaH0' of approximately +15 kcal/mol and a deltaS0' of approximately +55 cal/mol deg. Our data support the concept of a labile protein which participates directly in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1509948152,"Studies of the thermal stability of rat liver glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) were carried out to further elevate the proposal that the enzymic activity is the result of the coupling of a glucose-6-P-specific translocase and a nonspecific phosphohydrolase-phosphotransferase. Inactivation was observed when micorsomes were incubated at mild temperatures between pH 6.2 and 5.6. The rate of inactivation increased either with increasing hydrogen ion concentration or temperature. However, no inactivation was seen below 15 degrees in media as low as pH 5 or at neutral pH up to 37 degrees. The thermal stability of the enzyme may be controlled by the physical state of the membrane lipids and the degree of protonation of specific residues in the enzyme protein. Microsomes were exposed to inactivating conditions, and kinetic analyses were made of the glucose-6-P phosphohydrolase activities before and after supplementation to 0.4% sodium taurocholate. The results support the postulate and the kinetic characteristics of a given preparation of intact microsomes are determined by the relative capacities of the transport and catalytic components. Before detergent treatment, inactivation (i.e. a decrease in Vmax) was accompanied by a decrease in Km and a reduction in the fraction of latent activity, whereas only Vmax was depressed in disrupted preparations. The possibility that the inactivating treatments caused concurrent disruption of the microsomal membrane was ruled out. It is concluded that exposures to mild heat in acidic media selectively inactivate the catalytic component of the glucose-6-phosphatase system while preserving an intact permeability barrier and a functional glucose-6-P transport system. Analyses of kinetic data obtained in the present and earlier studies revealed several fundamental mathematical relationships among the kinetic constants describing the glucose-6-P phosphohydrolase activities of intact (i.e. the system) and disrupted microsomes (i.e. the catalytic component). The quantitative relationships appear to provide a means to calculate a velocity constant (VT) and a half-saturation constant (KT) for glucose-6-P influx. The well documented, differential responses of the rat liver glucose-6-phosphatase system induced by starvation, experimental diabetes, or cortisol administration were analyzed in terms of these relationships. The possible influences of cisternal inorganic phosphate on the apparent kinetic constants of the intact system are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1521370575,"The Cepsilon methyl group of the 2 methionine residues in sperm whale myoglobin was enriched with respect to 13C. This was accomplished by treatment of the apomyoglobin at pH 4 at room temperature with a 100-fold proportion of 13CH3I to form an intermediate containing enriched S-methylmethionine. Unselective demethylation to regain the apomyoglobin structure was accomplished by treatment at pH 10.5 with 0.5 M dithioerythritol at 37 degrees for 18 h. Reagents were removed at each stage by dialysis against dilute sodium azide solution. Hemin was reincorporated to form the holoprotein in a way that avoided the presence of an excess of the small molecule. After chromatographic purification the enriched myoglobin was obtained in a yield of between 29 and 60%. The composition, absorbance spectrum, circular dichroism spectrum, isoionic point, electrophoretic behavior, and oxygen-binding behavior following reduction were all indistinguishable from those of the virgin protein. NMR measurements were made at 15.1, 25.2, and 67.9 MHz at 27-30 degrees. The two enriched loci are represented by separate resonances that appear slightly downfield of the spectral position of the corresponding resonance in free methionine. The positions of these resonances are sensitive to pH and to the ligand bound at the heme group which is approximately 17 A distant from each methionine Cepsilon. On the basis of two separate types of experiment the downfield resonance was assigned to methionine 55 and the upfield resonance to methionine 131. Part of the observed variations in chemical shift could be treated as arising from pseudocontact interactions but part was ascribed to structural changes communicated to the environment of each methionine residue as a result of changes in heme ligand, pH, or temperature. The linewidths of the methionine Cepsilon resonances are narrowed by increasing temperature according to an Arrhenius energy of activation of nearly 3 kcal. The spin-lattice relaxation times, T1, of the two methionine Cepsilon resonances at the three spectrometer frequencies were interpreted to indicate the existence of rotational motions in each side chain in addition to that about the Sdelta-Cepsilon bond. The results as a whole show that the two methionine side chains undergo continuous variations in environment, and that these variations are controlled by events at a distance within the protein structure. It is suggested that the structural lability serves the function of facilitating conformational variations and adjustments within the heme pocket."

Total activity of the enzyme (active plus inactive forms) was not increased significantly. The lowest effective dose of acetylcholine was 5 X 10(-10) mole, and the optimum dose was 5 X 10(-9) mole. Similar applications of other neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid, did not affect the enzyme's activity."
https://openalex.org/W2110033734,"Intramolecular pepsinogen activation is inhibited either by pepstatin, a potent pepsin inhibitor, or by purified globin from hemoglobin, a good pepsin substrate. Also, pepsinogen at pH 2 can be bound to a pepstatin-Sepharose column and recovered as native zymogen upon elution in pH 8 buffer. Kinetic studies of the globin inhibition of pepsinogen activation show that globin binds to a pepsinogen intermediate. This interaction gives rise to competitive inhibition of intramolecular pepsinogen activation. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that pepsinogen is converted rapidly upon acidification to the pepsinogen intermediate delta. In the absence of an inhibitor, the intermediate undergoes conformational change to bind the activation peptide portion of this same pepsinogen molecule in the active center to form an intramolecular enzyme-substrate complex (intermediate theta). This is followed by the intramolecular hydrolysis of the peptide bond between residues 44 and 45 of the pepsinogen molecule and the dissociation of the activation peptide from the pepsin. Intermediate delta apparently does not activate another pepsinogen molecule via an intermolecular process. Neither does intermediate delta hydrolyze globin substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1528749179,"Adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin have been shown (Chu, J.-W., and Kimura, T. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5183-5187) to form a low dissociation constant, 1:1 complex when both proteins are in the oxidized form. We have found that when adrenodoxin: adrenodoxin reductase ratios are varied by increasing the adrenodoxin concentration, with adrenodoxin reductase held constant, an increasing rate of cytochrome c reduction, with NADPH as reductant, is seen up to a ratio of 1:1, indicating that cytochrome c reduction occurs via the protein-protein complex. Spectra observed during titration of this protein-protein complex with NADH were resolved into components by the linear programming method, using a computer program written in Fortran IV. Analysis of the data has shown that the flavoprotein is reduced prior to the iron sulfur protein, and that the midpoint oxidation-reduction potentials (pH 7.5) of the two proteins are -295 and -331 mV, respectively, when both are present in the complex. Complex formation does not alter the potential of adrenodoxin reductase, but changes that of adrenodoxin by -40 mV. Equilibrium constants derived from potential measurements show that the strength of the protein-protein interaction in the complex is unaltered by reduction of adrenodoxin reductase, but is decreased by about 1 kcal due to reduction of adrenodoxin. The low dissociation constants for both oxidized reduced forms of the adrenodoxin reductase-adrenodoxin complex indicate that the complex must remain associated throughout its catalytic cycle. Titration of the adrenodoxin reductase-adrenodoxin complex with the physiologic reductant, NADPH, was followed by EPR and visible spectra, and yielded an order of reduction of the components identical with that seen when NADH was used as reductant. Reduction of the protein-protein complex with NADPH yielded a ternary complex between NADP+, flavoprotein, and iron sulfur protein, with the two electrons located in a charge transfer complex between flavoprotein and pyridine nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1571195528,"The endoplasmic reticulum from isolated rat adipocytes has the ability to actively accumulate calcium. The calcium uptake was characterized using the 20,000 X g supernatant (S1 fraction) of total cellular homogenate. Endoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from the S1 fraction as a 160,000 X g microsomal pellet prior to testing demonstrated little ability to accumulate calcium. The calcium uptake in the S1 fraction was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum vesicles by morphologic appearance, by the use of selective inhibitors of calcium uptake, and by high speed sedimentation of the accumulated calcium. The uptake was MgATP- and temperature-dependent and was sustained by the oxalate used as the intravesicular trapping agent. Uptake was linear with time for at least 30 min at all calcium concentrations tested (3 to 100 muM) and exhibited a pH optimum of approximately 7.0. The sulfhydryl inhibitor p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate produced a dose-dependent inhibition of calcium uptake with total inhibition at 0.07 mumol/mg protein. Ruthenium red and sodium azide inhibited less than 5% of the uptake at concentrations (5 muM and 10 mM, respectively) which completely blocked calcium uptake by mitochondria isolated from the same cells. The Km for calcium uptake was 10 muM total calcium which corresponded to approximately 3.6 muM ionized calcium in the assay system. The maximum velocity of the uptake was 5.0 nmol (mg of microsomal protein)-1 (min)-1 at 24 degrees under the assay conditions used and exhibited a Q10 of 1.8. The uptake activity of the endoplasmic reticulum vesicles in the S1 fraction exhibited a marked time- and temperature-dependent lability which might account in part for the lack of uptake in the isolated microsomal fraction. This energy-dependent calcium uptake system would appear to be of physiologic importance to the regulation of intracellular calcium."
https://openalex.org/W2273557250,"Glutamine synthetase enzymes isolated from pea seeds and from Escherichia coli are observed to behave differently in experiments designed to probe reaction mechanism. Although both enzymes were found to bind and release substrates in random order mechanisms (Wedler, F.C. (1974) J. Biol. Chem, 247, 5080-5087), isotopic exchanges with partial reaction systems indicative of a gamma-glutamylphosphate intermediate are catalyzed only by the pea seed enzyme. The E. coli system fails to catalyze any exchanges at appreciable rates unless all substrates are present. This negative result implies either an absolute conformational requirement for bound substrates or that the putative complex (E-Glu-P-MgADP) is exceedingly tight. To test the latter, a nonreactive structural analog of gamma-glutamyl-phosphate, namely 3-(phosphonoacetylamido)-L-alanine (PA2LA), has been synthesized. With the E. coli enzyme PA2LA was found to bind no more tightly than L-glutamate and is strictly competitive versus L-glutamate (Ki = 3 mM). Thus, failure to catalyze partial exchange reactions indicative of gamma-Glu-P is probably not attributable to tight complex formation. The binding of PA2LA with the pea seed enzyme apparently involves a two-step process: a rapid, reversible step in which PA2LA binds 10-fold more tightly than L-glutamate, followed by a slow (but reversible) process involving very tight PA2LA binding, apparently with enzyme isomerization promoted by nucleotide. The specificity of the two enzymes toward L-methionine-SR-sulfoximine, Met(O)(NH), was also different..."
https://openalex.org/W1559651234,"2-Nitropropane dioxygenase, purified to homogeneity from Hansenula mrakii (IFO 0895), has a molecular weight of approximately 62,000 and consists of two subunits nonidentical in molecular weight (39,000 and 25,000). Stoichiometrical studies and the results obtained with 18O2 showed that 2 atoms of molecular oxygen are incorporated into 2 molecules of acetone formed from 2-nitropropane. In addition to 2-nitropropane, nitroethane, 3-nitro-2-pentanol, and 1-nitropropane are oxidatively dentrified. The enzyme, which exhibits absorption maxima at 274, 370, 415, and 440 nm and a shoulder at 470 nm, contains 1 mol of FAD and 1 g atom of non-heme iron per mol of enzyme. The enzyme-bound FAD is reduced by 2-nitropropane under anaerogic conditions, but the enzyme-bound Fe3+ is not affected. The introduction of oxygen to the reduced form of enzyme causes reoxidation of the enzyme. The bound FAD and Fe3+ are reduced by the addition of nitromethane, which is not a substrate, under anaerobic conditions. The aerobic dialysis of the enzyme treated with nitromethane causes reoxidation of only the Fe2+. Sodium dithionite also reduces both the enzyme-bound FAD and Fe3+ under anaerobic conditions. When the enzyme is dialyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) immediately after reduction by dithionite, the absorption spectrum similar to that of the native enzyme appeared with concomitant restoration of approximately 80% of the activity. The enzyme activity is significantly inhibited by pyrocatechol-3,5-disulfonate disodium salt, 8-hydroxyquinoline, reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol, and HgCl2. The Michaelis constants are as follows: 2-nitropropane (2.13 X 10(-2) M), nitroethane (2.43 X 10(-2) M), 3-nitro-2-pentanol (6.8 X 10(-3) M), 1-nitropropane (2.56 X 10(-2) M), and oxygen (3.03 X 10(-4) M, with 2-nitropropane)."

https://openalex.org/W1989915900,"An endoribonuclease which cleaves tRNA precursor molecules has been partially purified from human KB tissue culture cells. This activity is found in cytoplasmic fractions but is not detectable in the nucleoplasm. tRNA precursor molecules from both E. coli and KB cells are cleaved by this novel activity to produce 5' phosphate-terminated oligonucleotides. E coli RNAase P and the KB cell nuclease both make a single endonucleolytic scission in E. coli tRNATyr precursor, thereby separating the 41 extra nucleotides on the 5' end of the precursor molecule from the 5' terminal sequence of the mature tRNATyr molecule. The cleavage products generated from other E. coli tRNA precursors by the KB cell activity are identical in size to those produced by RNAase P. The KB cell endoribonuclease requires Mg2+ and a monovalent cation (Na+, K+, or NH4+) for function. The enzymatic activity has a broad pH optimum, centered near pH 8.0, and the activity is inhibited by tRNA. Several KB cell RNAs with long half-lives in vivo, including 5S and bulk 4S RNA, are not cleaved by this nuclease. The KB cell endoribonuclease resembles E. coli RNAase P in its substrate specificity, pH optimum, ion requirements, and sensitivity to tRNA. These properties and the cytoplasmic localization of the novel endoribonuclease indicate its involvement in the biosynthesis of KB cell tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1526851515,"We describe the reactions of three lipophilic, photoactivated cross-linking reagents, 1,5-diazidonapthalene, 4,4'-diazidobiphenyl, and the reversible 4,4'-dithiobisphenylazide, with erythrocyte membranes. Cross-linking occurs only upon photoactivation. At pH 7 to 8, only spectrin components are cross-linked by these reagents. At pH 5.0 to 5.5 several additional membrane proteins including the major integral membrane proteins are also cross-linked, despite equivalent binding of the cross-linkers at neutral and acid pH. The cross-linking rates of various membrane proteins at pH 5.0 to 5.5 depend distinctly upon duration of photoactivation. Bidimensional electrophoresis of membrane proteins after cross-linking with the reversible cross-linker, 4,4'-dithiobisphenylazide, has allowed for the identification of homopolymeric products of cross-linking (e.g. dimers and tetramers of Band 3) and heterocomplexes (spectrin plus other membrane proteins). The data suggest that at reduced pH, cross-linking can proceed not only at the membrane surface but also in the membrane core."

https://openalex.org/W1484967006,"N-Hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (N-OH-2-AAF) sulfotransferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the sulfate transfer from the active sulfate, 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), to N-OH-2-AAF to form a highly reactive product acetylaminofluorene N-sulfate. It has been purified about 2000-fold with a yield of over 12% from adult Sprague-Dawley male rat livers by an eight-step procedure. The final preparation was homogeneous on analytrical disc gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme had activity toward p-nitrophenol with an approximately 1600-fold increase in specific activity over the crude homogenate, but it had almost no detectable activity toward steroids such as estrone, beta-estradiol, testosterone, dehydroisoandrosterone, and corticosterone. There was also very little sulfation activity toward serotonin and L-tyrosine methyl ester. The optimal pH for the enzyme activity is approximately 6.3 when measured in sodium phosphate buffer. Mg2+ at 6 to 9 mM could increase the enzyme activity up to 30%. Mn2+ activated the enzyme only slightly at very low concentrations. Zn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ were all strongly inhibitory, but Ca2+ had very little effect. Thiol compounds were found to have a stabilizing effect and thiol-blocking reagents were potent inhibitors for this enzyme. The pure enzyme was very unstable especially in diluet solutions. The isoelectric point (pl) of the enzyme is 5.66 +/- 0.07. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was 68,000 +/- 500 as estimated by Sephadex G-100 and G-200 gel filtrations. A single component with molecular weight of 38,250 +/- 1,350 was observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis in the absence and presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Comparison of the enzyme activity in mail and female rat livers at each stage of purification revealed that there was only a trace amount of N-OH-2-AAF sulfotransferase present in the female rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1551459107,"An enzyme system was found in either crude homogenates of dialyzed extracts of liver, kidney, lung, and brain from Syrian golden hamsters that catalyzed the synthesis of radioactive 6(L-erythro-1',2'-dihydroxypropyl)pterin (biopterin) from [U-14C]6(D-erythro-1',2',3'-trihydroxypropyl)-7,8-dihydropterin triphosphate (D-erythrolH2neopterin-PPP) preparation. The specific radioactivity of biopterin was found to be comparable to that of D-erythroH2neopterin-PPP. The enzyme system from hamster kidney was purified severalfold by fractionation with ammonium sulfate and with an Ultrogel AcA-34 column. It was demonstrated that (a) NADPH or NADAH was essential and that (b) Mg2+ was stimulatory for the enzymatic synthesis of biopterin from D-erythroH2-NEOPTERIN-PPP. Also GTP and nonphosphorylated neopterins were not converted to biopterin. Although 6-lactyl-7,8-dihydropterin (sepiapterin) was converted to biopterin in the presence of NADPH, sepiapterin was not detected from D-erythroH2neopterin-PPP in the absence of NADPH. A preliminary experiment was performed to identify dihydrobiopterin."
https://openalex.org/W1564102144,"1. Generation of a transmembrane electric potential difference by oligomycin-sensitive ATPase complex, incorporated into spherical or planar phospholipid membrane, has been demonstrated. To this end, penetrating anion probe and direct voltmeter measurement of electric potential across phospholipid membrane were used. It was found that ATP-induced electric response is sensitive to oligomycin and protonophorous uncouplers. 2. The effect of variations in the phospholipid component of proteoliposomes on the electric generation was studied. It was revealed that the usage of mitochondrial phospholipids and phosphatidylethanolamine allows the highest values of membrane potential to be obtained in the case of ATPase proteoliposomes. In the case of cytochrome oxidase and bacteriorhodopsin proteoliposomes, phosphatidylserine was also shown to be quite suitable. Phosphatidylcholine was absolutely ineffective in all cases. 3. In proteoliposomes, containing both ATPase and bacteriorhodopsin, ATP and light induced generation of the electric field of the same direction. 4. In ATPase + cytochrome oxidase proteoliposomes, ATP hydrolysis and ascorbate oxidation was found to support electric generation of the same direction if cytochrome c was inside vesicles. Oxidation via external cytochrome c resulted in formation of electric field of the direction, opposite to that induced by ATP hydrolysis. 5. The data obtained in experiments with proteoliposomes of different types are discussed. The conclusion is made that conversion of energy of different resources into electric form is a common feature of membraneous energy transducers, which is in agreement with the Mitchellian principle of cellular energetics."
https://openalex.org/W1491532538,"L4, the affinity of hemoglobin for the 4th CO molecule, has been determined for human adult hemoglobin (HbA) as a function of pH and the presence of organic phosphates by measuring the kinetic parameters for the reaction. l'4, the rate of combination of CO with the triliganded molecule, was measured by flash photolysis while l4, the rate of CO dissociation for the ligand-saturated molecule, was measured by ligand replacement. L4 is pH-dependent and affected by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Additionally, this pH dependence of the high affinity state is largely eliminated by carboxypeptidase A digestion. L4 for human fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in phosphate buffers was also determined and found to be pH-dependent. These results cannot be reconciled within the framework of the two-state allosteric model. Additional structures in the conformational equilibrium due to either intermediates in the T to R transition or two or more R states must exist."
https://openalex.org/W1496810241,"The conversion of proparathyroid hormone (proparathormone) to parathyroid hormone (parathormone) by subcellular fractions of the bovine parathyroid has been investigated. The identification of the conversion product as parathormone was established by its elution postion during ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration, and by partial amino acid sequence analysis of its NH2-terminal region. Total homogenates and derived subcellular fractions (600 X g pellet, 5,000 X g pellet, 20,000 X g pellet, 190,000 X g pellet, and 190,000 X g supernatant) all catalyzed the conversion of exogenous [3H]- or [14C]prohormone. Over 60% of the converting activity was in the particulate fractions; the 190,000 X g particulate fraction contained the highest specific converting activity. The converting activity appeared to be an integral component of the membranes since it could only be partially removed by extraction with Triton X-100. The production of parathormone by the particulate converting enzyme increased with time and the concentration of enzyme protein. The optimum pH range was between 7 and 9, and the enzyme was inactive below pH 6. Conversion by the particulate enzyme was inhibited by benzamidine or chloroquine, but not by pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, indicating its dissimilarity to trypsin. When a mixture of [14C]proparathormone and [3H]parathormone was used as substrate, the particulate enzyme did not metabolize the hormone despite over 70% conversion of the prohormone to hormone and other peptides. There was a close correlation between the subcellular distribution of converting activity and that of newly formed parathormone found in the membrane fraction. These data suggest that the particulate converting activity is that concerned with the formation of parathormone in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1521231913,"A method is described for the isolation and purification of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from pig liver. The molecular weight is estimated at 83,000 and that of the subunits is 42,000 as determined by gel electrophoresis. The pH maximum is 8.5 in 50 mM glycine/NaOH buffer and from 7.5 to 10 in 50 mM phosphate buffer at 30 degrees. Magnesium ion is not required for activity and acts as an inhibitor at concentrations above 20 mM. A cellular fractionation study indicates that this enzyme is located almost entirely within the soluble portion of the cytoplasm. Kinetic studies have been done in 50 mM glycine buffer, pH 8.5, at 30 degrees. The data are consistent with a sequential mechanism in which NADP+ is added first, followed by 6-phosphogluconate, and the products are released in the order, CO2, ribulose 5-phosphate, and NADPH. The Michaelis constant is 13.5 muM for 6-phosphogluconate. Dissociation constants are 4.8 muM for NADP+ and 5.1 muM for NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1495371823,"The kinetic and molecular properties of a phosphofructokinase derived from a transplantable rat thyroid tumor lacking regulatory control on the glycolytic pathway were studied. The properties of the near-purified enzyme (specific activity 140 units/mg) were compared with those of phosphofructokinase from normal rat thyroid (specific activity 134 units/mg). The electrophoretic mobilities and gel elution behavior of these two enzymes were almost similar. The thyroid tumor phosphofructokinase showed, however, a greater degree of size and/or shape heterogeneity in the presence of ATP than the normal thyroid enzyme, as determined by gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Kinetic studies below pH 7.4 showed a sigmoid response curve for both enzymes when the velocity was determined at 1 mM ATP with varying levels of fructose-6-P. The interaction coefficient, however, was 4.2 and 2.6 for normal and tumor thyroid phosphofructokinase, respectively. Ammonium sulfate decreased the cooperative interactions with the substrate fructose-6-P in both enzymes. The thyroid tumor enzyme, however, was less sensitive to the inhibition by ATP and by citrate. The reversal of citrate inhibition by cyclic 3':5'-adenosine monophosphate was also less effective with the thyroid tumor phosphofructokinase, while the protective effect of fructose-6-P was stronger. The difference in citrate inhibition between tumor and normal thyroid enzyme was not strongly affected by varying the MgCl2 concentration up to 10 mM. It is concluded that the complex allosteric regulation typical of the normal thyroid phosphofructokinase is still present in the enzyme isolated from the thyroid tumor tissue. The latter, however, is more loosely controlled by its physiological effectors, such as ATP, citrate, and cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1554563453,"The interactions of horse spleen ferritin and its derivative apoferritin with H+ ions were studied by potentiometric and spectrophotometric titration; to aid in data analysis, heats of ionization over a limited pH range and amide content were also determined. Per apoferritin subunit, all tyrosine and cysteine side chains, two of the nine lysine side chains and at least three of the six histidine side chains were found not to titrate; a preliminary but self-consistent analysis of the titration data is proposed. The titration curve of ferritin was identical with that of apoferritin in the pH range 5.5 to 3. In addition, under the conditions used, the reactivities of ferritin histidines to bromoacetate and of ferritin lysines to formaldehyde were identical with those in apoferritin. Above pH 8, a time-dependent titration of the ferritin core occurs which prevents comparison of the titration curves of the two proteins in this region. However, in the pH regions 5.5 to 7.5, two extra groups per subunit titrate reversibly in ferritin relative to apoferritin. Moreover, although the isoionic points of ferritin and apoferritin are identical in water, the isoionic point of ferritin is 0.5 pH unit lower than that of apoferritin in 0.16 to 1 M KCl. The different effects of KCl and NaCl on the two proteins indicate the presence of cation binding sites in ferritin that are absent in apoferritin and possibly also the presence of anion binding sites in apoferritin that are occupied in ferritin by anions of the core. The difference between the isoionic points of the two proteins in KCl has been interpreted to indicate the presence of approximately 2 phosphate residues per ferritin subunit which serve as cation binding sites and which are negatively charged at the isoionic point in KCl. These phosphates may also represent the additional residues that titrate in ferritin between pH 5.5 and 7.5, or may interact with positively charged residues on the inner surface of the ferritin shell, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1622853955,"The rate of methemoglobin reduction by ascorbic acid was accelerated in the presence of ATP,2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), and inositol hexaphosphate (IHP). The acceleration was as much as three times, four times, and ten times in the presence of ATP, 2.3-DPG, and IHP at pH 7.0, respectively. The changes of the concentrations of methemoglobin and ascorbic acid during the methemoglobin reduction were determined, and the reaction was found to proceed stoichiometrically in the presence of IHP. The reduction rate of methemoglobin by ascorbic acid was compared at different concentrations of organic phosphates (ATP,2,3-DPG, and IHP) at various pH values (6.3, 7.0, 7.7). From the changes in the reduction rate under different concentrations of organic phosphates, the dissociation constants of ATP, 2,3-DPG, and IHP to methemoglobin could be determined and were estimated to be 3.3 X 10(-4) M, 2 X 10(-3) M, and 8 X 10(-6) M at pH 7.0, respectively. On the basis of these results, the acceleration mechanism of methemoglobin reduction by ascorbic acid due to the presence of organic phosphates was described. The physiological role of 2,3-DPG in human red cells was discussed in relation to the reduction of methemoglobin by ascorbic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1558359858,"Two enzymes which transaminate tyrosine and phenylalanine in Bacillus subtilis were each purified over 200-fold and partially characterized. One of the enzymes, termed histidinol phosphate aminotransferase, is also active with imidazole acetyl phosphate as the amino group recipient. Previous studies have shown that mutants lacking this enzyme require histidine for growth. Mutants in the other enzyme termed aromatic aminotransferase are prototrophs. Neither enzyme is active on any other substrate involved in amino acid synthesis. The two enzymes can be distinguished by a number of criteria. Gel filtration analysis indicate the aromatic and histidinol phosphate aminotransferases have molecular weights of 63,500 and 33,000, respectively. Histidinol phosphate aminotransferase is heat-sensitive, whereas aromatic aminotransferase is relatively heat-stable, particularly in the presence of alpha-ketoglutarate. Both enzymes display typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics in their rates of reaction. The two enzymes have similar pH optima and employ a ping-pong mechanism of action. The Km values for various substrates suggest that histidinol phosphate aminotransferase is the predominant enzyme responsible for the transamaination reactions in the synthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine. This enzyme has a 4-fold higher affinity for tyrosine and phenylalanine than does the aromatic aminotransferase. Competitive substrate inhibition was observed between tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidinol phosphate for histidinol phosphate aminotransferase. The significance of the fact that an enzyme of histidine synthesis plays an important role in aromatic amino acid synthesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1579379188,"The effect of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate (IdUMP), various 5-halogenated-5'-azido-2', 5' -dideoxyuridine derivatives, 2'-deoxy-6-azauridine (AzdUrd), and its halogenated analogs on the ultraviolet sensitization of Escherichia coli thymidylate kinase has been investigated. Only those compounds iodinated in position 5 enhance the rate of ultraviolet inactivation of this enzyme. However, 5'-azido nucleosides with iodo, bromo, chloro, or fluoro substituents in position 5 neither protect nor sensitize thymidylate kinase to ultraviolet inactivation. Thymidine 5'-monophosphate partially protects the enzyme against ultraviolet inactivation either in the presence or absence of ultraviolet-sensitizing iodinated analogs. Magnesium ion does not enhance the ultraviolet inactivation of thymidylate kinase by 5-iodinated nucleoside analogs. The kinatic data support an active site-directed enhancement of the enzyme to ultraviolet inactivation by 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate, since the concentration of IdUMP required to attain 50% maximal enhancement is 0.24 mM which is in good agreement with its Ki of 0.18 mM. When either [125I]IdUMP or [2-14C]IdUMP was irradiated with the enzyme, both radioactivities were associated with the enzyme, however only with the 14C analog was the amount bound at half-saturation essentially equal to the amount required to inactivate the enzyme by 50%. These data support the hypothesis that the active entity in the enhancement by IdUMP of thymidylate kinase inactivation during ultraviolet irradiation is the uridylate free radical which is formed photochemically from IdUMP. Photochemical studies of 6-azauracil (AzUra), 2'-deoxy-6-azauridine, and 5-iodo-2'-deoxy-6-azauridine (IAzdUrd) were performed. Photolysis of IAzdUrd in the presence of a hydrogen donor yields AzdUrd which upon further photolysis yields the photohydrate. The photohydrate of AzdUrd when incubated in the dark at pH 5.2 is 90% converted back to AzdUrd, whereas the photohydrate of AzUra is only partially (20%) converted to AzUra. The rate of deiodination of IAzdUrd is 2.1-fold greater than that of IdUMP. Although the Ki of IdUMP and IAzdUrd is similar, the increased photosensitivity of the aza analog accounts for the much greater enhancement of ultraviolet inactivation of thymidylate kinase. The ability of a compound to enhance the ultraviolet inactivation of deoxythymidylate kinase is correlated with the potential of the compound to produce a free radical rather than a photohydrate when the enzyme-substrate analog complex is irradiated."
https://openalex.org/W1555150960,"Previous studies have shown that chlorite serves as a halogenation substrate for horseradish peroxidase. In its substrate role, chlorite serves both as a halogen donor and as a source of oxidizing equivalents in the chlorination reaction. We now show that a new spectral intermediate, which we have termed Compound X, can be detected as the initial product of the reaction of chlorite with horseradish peroxidase. The reaction of chlorite with horseradish peroxidase to form Compound X is a relatively fast reaction especially at acidic pH values. The second order rate constant (Kf) for the formation of Compound X at pH 4.5 (optimum pH) is 0.9 X 10(6) M-1 S-1. Compound X, in the absence of a halogen acceptor, decomposes to Compound I and chloride ion. The first order rate constant (Kd) for the decay of Compound X to Compound I is 0.2 s-1 at pH 4.5. The pH optimum for enzymatic chlorination with chlorite compares favorably with the pH profile for the lifetime of Compound X (Kf/Kd). These observations indicate that Compound X is the halogenating intermediate in the chlorite reaction and that the rate of enzymatic chlorination is directly related to the stability of Compound X. We propose an -OCl ligand on a ferric heme as the most likely structure for Compound X."

Occasionally, the recommended purification procedure yields a small amount (3% or less) of a single extraneous protein which can be deleted from the enzyme preparation by employing an additional purification step. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of 54,000 to 56,000 as determined by equilibrium centrifugation and exclusion chromatography. Disc gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate yields a single protein band with a molecular weight of 28,600, indicating that the native macromolecule is a dimer composed of subunits of similar mass.

https://openalex.org/W1504388408,"Porcine and rat microsomal stearyl-CoA desaturases require reduced pyridine nucleotide and oxygen, are cyanide sensitive, and are insensitive to carbon monoxide. The Km for stearyl-CoA is somewhat larger for liver than for the adipose desaturases, but, in general, assay conditions are quite similar. Adipose tissue microsomes contain cytochromes b5 and P-450, as well as the NADH- and NADPH-specific cytochrome reductases. Compared to liver, the specific contents and activities of electron carriers are much lower in adipose tissue, and activities of 4-methyl sterol oxidase of cholesterol biosynthesis, as well as the cytochrome P-450-dependent aminopyrene demethylase and benzypyrene hydroxylase, are negligible in adipose tissue microsomes. Furthermore, unlike hepatic desaturase, administration of insulin stimulates the adipose desaturase 3-fold without affecting either the amounts or activities of microsomal oxidation-reduction proteins; the changes in desaturase activities produced either by altering dietary fat or by fasting and/or fasting followed by refeeding are, in general, both more extensive and more permanent in adipose compared to liver microsomes. The effects produced by isotopic hydrogen substitution both in stearyl-CoA and in the medium (2H2O) are similar with microsomes from both tissues. The rate-determining step of desaturase appears to be similar in both tissues. The primary isotope effect, k H/Tr, observed with [9,10-3H2]stearyl-CoA is relatively small, 2.88. Since little, if any, primary isotope effect is associated with methyl sterol oxidase, these two mixed function oxidases of biosynthetic processes also appear to share this property in common."
https://openalex.org/W97193217,"N-Chloro-D-leucine is an irreversible inhibitor or D-amino acid oxidase on a time scale of seconds. Studies with N-[36C]chloro-D-leucine, N-chloro-D-[1-14C]leucine and N-chloro-D-[4,5-3H]leucine show that the modified enzyme has been chlorinated at a site, or sites, on the apoenzyme. The 36Cl measurements agree with titrations of catalytic activity in showing that two chlorine equivalents are incorporated per active site flavin. Kinetically, the interaction with N-chloro-D-leucine behaves in a manner which is consistent with consecutive chlorinations of an amino acid residue, or residues, in the active site region by the first 2 molecules of N-chloro-D-leucine to be processed by the enzyme. The effect of chlorination of the enzyme on the steady state parameters for oxidation of D-alanine is entirely explained by a single perturbation, namely, a 1000-fold reduction in the specific rate of flavin reduction as measured directly by rapid reaction techniques."

Bound phosphate serves as the phosphoryl donor for this uncoupler-insensitive conversion. Exposure of the thylakoids to heat or to urea prior to their injection into acid caused dissociation of ADP and prevents the apparent acid-induced synthesis of ATP.

https://openalex.org/W1599750473,"The effect of Cr(NH3)2ATP, a virtually inert, inner sphere metal-ligand complex, on the kinetics of purified yeast hexokinase PII has been studied at pH 6.5 and pH 7.5. At pH 6.5, where the normal assays exhibit a slow burst-type transient, low concentrations of Cr(NH3)2ATP were found to activate both phii, the initial velocity, and phiII, the steady state velocity. At higher concentrations, Cr(NH3)2ATP was found to be a competitive inhibitor versus MgATP for both phii and phiII. The apparent Ki values for both velocities were the same. The inhibition by Cr(NH3)2ATP at pH 6.5 was found to be a slow process with half-times similar to those found for the normal burst-type transient at this pH value. At pH 7.5, where normal assays exhibit linear progress curves, Cr(NH3)2ATP behaved similarly to that observed before at pH 7 (Danenberg, D. D., and Cleland, W. W. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 28-39), i.e. it was a competitive inhibitor versus MgATP and it caused a slowing of the reaction rate over the first several minutes. The apparent Ki for the initial velocity was 8-fold higher than the apparent Ki for the steady state velocity, suggesting tighter binding of Cr(NH3)2ATP with time. Preincubation experiments indicated that the normal pH 6.5 burst-type transient could be eliminated by appropriate preincubation with Cr(NH3)2ATP and a sugar. In agreement with Danenberg and Cleland (1975), similar preincubations have been shown to produce linear assays at pH 7.5 in the presence of Cr(NH3)2ATP. Similar results were seen with MgITP as the nucleotide substrate, where a burst-type transient is not seen at either pH value under normal assay conditions. At pH 7.5, a slow decrease in the reaction rate is seen over the first several minutes in the presence of Cr(NH3)2ATP. The apparent Ki for phii was 7-fold higher than the apparent Ki value for phiII, again suggesting a tighter binding of Cr(NH3)2ATP with time. A similar observation was made at pH 6.5, but the Ki values for phii and phiII were the same, suggesting no tightening of the binding of Cr(NH3)2ATP with time at this pH value. These results suggested that both slow processes reflect the same basic molecular change, but the consequences are different at the two pH values, presumably because of the difference in the charge of the enzyme. The Cr(NH3)2ATP kinetics at pH 6.5 have been interpreted in terms of a modification of the slow transition mechanism for hexokinase (Shill, J. P., and Neet, K. E. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 2259-2268). It is postulated that glucose and Cr(NH3)2ATP induce the same slow conformational change at pH 6.5 as that induced by glucose and MgATP, which gives rise to the normal burst-type transient. This suggests that Cr(NH3)2ATP may be a useful tool for physical studies to determine the cause of the slow transition of yeast hexokinase. Activation by low concentrations of Cr(NH3)2ATP was interpreted as binding of the nucleotide to an activator site on the enzyme, causing a shift in the distribution of enzyme towards the more active form."
