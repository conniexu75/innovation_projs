https://openalex.org/W2003410399,"The cellular and subcellular distributions of the glutamate transporter subtypes EAAC1, GLT-1, and GLAST in the rat CNS were demonstrated using anti-peptide antibodies that recognize the C-terminal domains of each transporter. On immunoblots, the antibodies specifically recognize proteins of 65-73 kDa in total brain homogenates. Immunocytochemistry shows that glutamate transporter subtypes are distributed differentially within neurons and astroglia. EAAC1 is specific for certain neurons, such as large pyramidal cortical neurons and Purkinje cells, but does not appear to be selective for glutamatergic neurons. GLT-1 is localized only to astroglia. GLAST is found in both neurons and astroglia. The regional localizations are unique to each transporter subtype. EAAC1 is highly enriched in the cortex, hippocampus, and caudate-putamen and is confined to pre- and postsynaptic elements. GLT-1 is distributed in astrocytes throughout the brain and spinal cord. GLAST is most abundant in Bergmann glia in the cerebellar molecular layer brain, but is also present in the cortex, hippocampus, and deep cerebellar nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W2145930493,"We demonstrate that mutations in the human Ca2+-sensing receptor gene cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and neonatal severe hyperpara-thyroidism (NSHPT), two inherited conditions characterized by altered calcium homeostasis. The Ca2+-sensing receptor belongs to the superfamily of seven membrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptors. Three nonconservative missense mutations are reported: two occur in the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptor; the third occurs in the final intracellular loop. One mutated receptor identified in FHH individuals was expressed in X. laevis oocytes. The expressed wild-type receptor elicted large inward currents in response to perfused polyvalent cations; a markedly attenuated response was observed with the mutated protein. We conclude that the mammalian Ca2+-sensing receptor “sets” the extracellular Ca2+ level and is defective in individuals with FHH and NSHPT."
https://openalex.org/W1973766879,"An IL-1-stimulated protein kinase cascade resulting in phosphorylation of the small heat shock protein hsp27 has been identified in KB cells. It is distinct from the p42 MAP kinase cascade. An upstream activator kinase phosphorylated a 40 kDa kinase (p40) upon threonine and tyrosine residues, which in turn phosphorylated a 50 kDa kinase (p50) upon threonine (and some serine) residues. p50 phosphorylated hsp27 upon serine. p40 and p50 were purified to near homogeneity. All three components were inactivated by protein phosphatase 2A, and p40 was inactivated by protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B. The substrate specificity of p40 differed from that of p42 and p54 MAP kinases. The upstream activator was not a MAP kinase kinase. p50 resembled MAPKAPK-2 and may be identical."
https://openalex.org/W2064215369,"We used the enhancer detection/GAL4 system in Drosophila to direct increased levels of Fasciclin II (Fas II) expression on motoneuron growth cones and axons and to direct ectopic Fas II expression on other cells they encounter. Four classes of abnormal phenotypes are observed: ""bypass"" phenotypes, in which axons fail to defasciculate at the choice point where they would normally enter their muscle target region and instead extend past their target; ""detour"" phenotypes, in which these bypass growth cones enter their muscle target region at a different location; ""stall"" phenotypes, in which axons that enter their muscle target region fail to defasciculate from one another to probe their muscle targets; and ""misroute"" phenotypes, in which growth cones are diverted onto abnormal pathways by contact with Fas II-positive cells. These phenotypes show that changes in the pattern and level of Fas II expression can alter growth cone guidance, apparently in part by modulating the ability of these growth cones to respond to other guidance cues."
https://openalex.org/W2171960232,"Cell contact-dependent neurite outgrowth stimulated by CAMs requires activation of a second messenger pathway that requires the function of a tyrosine kinase upstream from calcium influx into neurons. In the present study, we present evidence that implicates activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) in the pathway underlying neurite outgrowth stimulated by L1, N-CAM, and N-cadherin. We have identified a CAM homology domain in the FGF family of receptors and show that antibodies which bind to this domain specifically inhibit neurite outgrowth stimulated by the above CAMs. We also show that synthetic peptides derived from this domain can differentially and specifically inhibit neurite outgrowth stimulated by L1, N-CAM, and N-cadherin. In addition, a soluble L1-Fc chimera is shown to stimulate an increase in phosphotyrosine on the same set of neuronal proteins that are phosphorylated following activation of the FGFR with basic FGF."

https://openalex.org/W2040792888,"Rab proteins are generally required for transport vesicle docking. We have exploited yeast secretion mutants to demonstrate that a rab protein is required for v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs to assemble. The absence of the rab protein in the docking complex suggests that, in a broad sense, rab proteins participate in a reaction catalyzing SNARE complex assembly. In so doing, rab proteins could help impart an additional layer of specificity to vesicle docking. This mechanism likely involves the Sec1 homolog Sly1, which we identified in isolated docking complexes. We also report the identification of a novel v-SNARE (Ykt6p) component of the yeast ER-Golgi docking complex that has a CAAX box and is predicted to be lipid anchored. The surprising finding that docking complexes can contain many distinct species of SNAREs (Sed5p, Bos1p, Sec22p, Ykt6p, and likely Bet1p, p28, and p14) suggests that multimeric interactions are features of the fusion machinery, and may also improve the fidelity of vesicle targeting."

https://openalex.org/W2052799365,"Activation of growth factor receptors results in tyrosine autophosphorylation and recruitment of SH2 domain-containing effectors, including Grb2. Grb2 recruitment mediates activation of the Ras nucleotide exchanger Sos by an unknown mechanism. To examine the role of membrane recruitment, we prepared Sos derivatives containing either myristoylation or farnesylation signals. This resulted in plasma membrane targeting of Sos and stimulation of the Ras signaling pathway, including ERK and AP-1 activities leading to oncogenic transformation. Sos derivatives with nonfunctional myristoylation or farnesylation sequences were inactive. Farnesylation of Sos also activated Ras signaling in yeast. In both mammalian cells and yeast, membrane-targeted Sos derivatives lacking the C-terminal region were considerably more active. Therefore, targeting of Sos to the plasma membrane in the vicinity of Ras appears to be the primary mechanism leading to activation of the Ras pathway. A secondary mechanism could involve relief of the inhibitory effect of the Sos C-terminal region."

https://openalex.org/W2008203029,"The mutation of N-CAM in mice produces a phenotype dominated by an undersized olfactory bulb and accumulation of precursors in the subependymal layer. We demonstrate here that this defect can be duplicated by injection of an enzyme that specifically destroys the polysialic acid (PSA) moiety associated with N-CAM. Studies of BrdU-labeled and pyknotic cells suggest that this defect reflects a decrease in the rostral migration of olfactory precursors and not a change in the proliferation or rate of death of these cells. In addition to their ectopic location, these cells had fewer growth cone-like processes oriented along the migration route. In contrast to tangential movement, radial migration of granule cells in the olfactory bulb was not affected by loss of PSA. These results support the proposed role for PSA in cell translocation, discriminate between different mechanisms of cell migration, and provide insight as to the nature of the N-CAM mutant phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2046501957,"Simultaneous whole-cell recordings were made from the soma and dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje cells in rat brain slices. Sodium action potentials, evoked by either depolarizing current pulses or synaptic stimulation of parallel or climbing fibers, always occurred first at the soma and decreased in amplitude with increasing distance into the dendrites. Simultaneous somatic and axonal recordings showed that these action potentials were initiated in the axon. Outside-out patches excised from the soma and dendrites revealed that the sodium channel current density decreased with distance from the soma. Consistent with this finding, comparable attenuation was observed for evoked action potentials and simulated action potential waveforms when sodium channels were blocked. These results show that sodium action potentials in cerebellar Purkinje cells are initiated in the axon and then spread passively into the dendritic tree."

https://openalex.org/W2002189059,"High conductance, Ca2+-activated (BK-type) K+ channels from mouse (mSlo) and Drosophila (dSlo) differ in their functional properties but share a conserved core resembling voltage-gated K+ channels and a tail appended to the core by a nonconserved linker. We have found that the channel subunit is physically divisible into these two conserved domains and that the core determines such properties as channel open time, conductance, and, probably, voltage dependence, whereas the tail determines apparent Ca2+ sensitivity. Both domains are required for function. We demonstrated the different roles of the core and tail by taking advantage of the functional differences between mSlo and dSlo. Heterologous pairing of cores and tails from mSlo and dSlo showed that single-channel properties were always characteristic of the core species, but that apparent Ca2+ sensitivity was adjusted up or down depending on the species of the tail. Thus, the tail is implicated in the Ca2+-sensing role of BK channels."

https://openalex.org/W1968021596,"The Drosophila protein Rop shows similarity with the Sec1p protein of S. cerevisiae. Sec1p has an essential role in secretion, whereas most related proteins from higher organisms are hypothesized to function in neurotransmitter release. We show that, like the latter proteins, Rop is expressed in the nervous system, but it is expressed in other tissues as well, many of which are actively engaged in secretion. We have isolated mutations in the Rop gene and find that the extracellular accumulation of a number of normally secreted cellular products fails to occur in null mutant animals, which subsequently die at a late embryonic stage. Electrophysiological recordings on temperature-sensitive Rop mutants show that reductions in Rop activity result in a loss of the normal synaptic response to a light stimulus. These data suggest that a member of the Sec1p class of proteins has an in vivo function in both general secretion and synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2019121351,"Changes in osmotic and hydrostatic pressure were found to modulate NMDA responses of cultured embryonic mouse neurons recorded in various patch-clamp configurations. In nucleated patches, NMDA currents were potentiated by reductions in external osmolarity and were reduced in hyper-osmotic solutions. These changes, which were greater for low concentrations of NMDA, were not observed for responses to kainate, glycine, or GABA. They could be mimicked by directly changing the pipette pressure in nucleated, outside-out, inside-out, and cell-attached patches. Osmosensitivity of NMDA responses was also observed in the whole-cell mode, but only after prolonged dialysis. Mechanosensitivity of NMDA receptors could have an important role in neuronal regions experiencing changes in membrane tension, such as spines or growth cones."

https://openalex.org/W2089104876,"Following UP induction in freely moving rats, in situ hybridization revealed discrete changes in the expression of one isoform in each of four families of serine/threonine kinases constitutively expressed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Expression of the a isoform of CaMKII showed a transient increase over the soma and a more persistent increase over the dendritic field of dentate granule cells. Of the PKC isoforms, only γ PKC was up-regulated substantially 2 hr after LTP induction, declining to control levels 48 hr later. An increase in the expression of mRNA for ERK2 and raf-B was seen at 24 hr only. These results show that, during the maintenance phase of UP in the hippocampus, there are selective increases in the expression of serine/threonine kinases and that these increases have specific and characteristic temporal and spatial profiles."

https://openalex.org/W2055366150,"Connectin, a cell surface protein of the leucine-rich repeat family in Drosophila, is expressed on the surface of a subset of embryonic muscles (primarily lateral muscles), on the growth cones and axons of the motoneurons that innervate these muscles (primarily SNa motoneurons), and on several associated glial cells. When coupled with its ability to mediate homophilic cell adhesion, these results led to the suggestion that Connectin functions as an attractive signal for SNa pathfinding and targeting. In the present study, we ectopically expressed Connectin on ventral muscles normally innervated by SNb motoneurons. The SNb growth cones change both their morphology and their trajectory when they encounter ectopic Connectin-positive ventral muscles, displaying ""bypass,"" ""detour,"" and ""stall"" phenotypes. Moreover, SNb synapse formation is prevented by Connectin expression on ventral muscles. These results reveal a repulsive function for Connectin during motoneuron growth cone guidance and synapse formation."

https://openalex.org/W2137191431,"Homologous recombination-dependent DNA replication (RDR) of a λ cos site-carrying plasmid is demonstrated in E. coli cells when the cells express λ terminase that introduces a double-stranded break into the cos site. RDR occurs in normal wild-type cells if the plasmid also contains the recombination hotspot χ. χ is dispensable when cells are induced for the SOS response or contain a recD mutation. recBC sbcA mutant cells are also capable of RDR induction. A recN mutation greatly reduces RDR in normal cells, but not in SOS-induced cells. RDR proceeds by the θ mode or rolling circle mode of DNA synthesis, yielding covalently closed circular plasmid monomers or linear plasmid multimers, respectively. Previously described inducible stable DNA replication is considered to be a special type of RDR that starts exclusively from specific sites (oriMs) on the chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1982546905,"We have investigated the effects of inhibitors of protein kinases and protein phosphatases on the NMDA receptor-independent potentiation of evoked and miniature (m) excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) induced by the entry of Ca2+ via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Voltage pulse-induced potentiation was markedly attenuated when evoked in the presence of the protein kinase blockers KN-62, K-252a, or H-7. Bath application of the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A converted the usual transient potentiation of both evoked and spontaneous EPSCs induced by voltage pulses into a more sustained potentiation. Similarly, the introduction of the phosphatase inhibitors microcystin LIZ or okadaic acid into postsynaptic cells, via patch pipettes, also resulted in a sustained increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs. We propose that entry of Ca2+ into CA1 neurons activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, which leads to an enhanced responsiveness of synaptic AMPA receptor channels. The enhancement is transient, however, owing to postsynaptic phosphatase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2045716874,"The best characterized Ca2+ channel modulation in mammalian sympathetic neurons is an inhibition of N-type channels via a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein. Here, we show that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), an abundant neuropeptide in the PNS and CNS, inhibited N-type Ca2+ channels in rat sympathetic neurons in a voltage-dependent, membrane-delimited manner. The effect of VIP was insensitive to PTX but was attenuated by cholera toxin or anti-Gsα antibodies. VIP-mediated inhibition was independent of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). The results provide evidence for a new signal transduction pathway in which N-type Ca2+ channel modulation requires activation of Gsα but is independent of PKA-mediated phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2105320508,"The molecular mechanisms involved in glial/neuronal fate decisions during embryonic development are largely unknown. Here we show that the segment-polarity gene engrailed, which encodes a homeodomain protein, controls these decisions within an insect CNS lineage. The grasshopper median neuroblast (MNB) generates both neurons and midline glia in distinct temporal phases. engrailed expression in MNB progeny can be inhibited by injection of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides into the MNB nucleus. This produces a phenotype in which the midline glia do not develop and extra midline neurons are generated. In the absence of engrailed function, midline glial precursors are apparently converted into neuronal precursors. Thus, engrailed is required for execution of the decision between the glial and neuronal fates."

https://openalex.org/W1508676160,"A fragment of 16S RNA corresponding to most of the 5′-domain (residues 1-526) was prepared by in vitro run-off transcription. When this fragment was incubated with a mixture of 30S proteins under conditions known to result in the in vitro assembly of a complete, functional 30S ribosome from a full-length transcript, a discrete 16S particle was formed. This particle contained near stoichiometric amounts of ribosomal proteins S4, S16, S17, and S20. These four proteins are the same, and only, ones that have been shown to interact with the 5′ domain of 16S RNA in the intact 30S ribosome in the foot-printing studies of Noller and co-workers. We conclude that the 5′ fragment 1-526 is capable of folding independently of the rest of the molecule so as to generate the protein binding sites for the same four proteins with which the corresponding segment of full-length 16S RNA normally interacts. These sites not only include those for S4, S17, and S20 that are known to bind directly to the RNA, but also the site for S16, which requires the prior binding of S4 and S20.— Weitzmann, C.

https://openalex.org/W2056086999,"Complementary DNAs encoding two types of inwardly rectifying K+ channels, GIRK1 and IRK1, have been cloned from rat atrium and mouse macrophage, respectively. GIRK1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes was activated by acetylcholine when m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor was coexpressed. The acetylcholine-induced activation of GIRK1 was enhanced by coexpression with the G protein beta 1 gamma 2 subunit but not the beta 1 gamma 1 or alpha subunits. Deletion of the C-terminus of GIRK1 impaired the channel activation associated with the beta 1 gamma 2 subunit. Moreover, replacement of the C-terminus of IRK1 with that of GIRK1 produced a chimera channel that was activated by the beta 1 gamma 2 subunit, whereas intact IRK1 was not activated by the beta 1 gamma 2 subunit. These findings define the C-terminus of GIRK1 as a regulatory region for the G protein beta gamma subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2097577318,"Mutations in the Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene have been reported in some pedigrees with Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (FALS). We have investigated the functional and structural effects of a Gly→Ser mutation at codon 41 of SOD1 in a pedigree with FALS and the topography of SOD 1 expression in the mammalian CNS. These analyses show that the 41Gly→Ser mutation causes a 27% reduction in Cu, Zn SOD activity. SOD1 is transcribed at high levels in rat motoneurons and four other types of neurons homologous to upper motoneurons that degenerate in human ALS. However, SOD1 is transcribed at lower levels in other types of neurons, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are not usually involved significantly in human ALS. On the other hand, immunocytochemical studies indicate that most types of rat neurons contain similar levels of Cu, Zn SOD immunoreactive protein. Nevertheless, these results suggest that the essential feature causing this subtype of ALS is either a reduction in Cu, Zn SOD activity in cell types that presumably critically require Cu, Zn SOD for protection against oxidative damage or the fact that the mutation in SOD1 associated with FALS results in a novel gain of function that is particularly deleterious to those cell types expressing SOD1 at high levels."
https://openalex.org/W2030610882,"Neurotoxin-induced activation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels provoked rapid () channel down-regulation in cultured rat brain neurons, resulting in a 50%–70% decrease in [3H]saxitoxin and 125I-α-scorpion toxin binding capacities as well as a decrease in Na+ peak current. Experiments using 125I-α-scorpion toxin as both a Na+ channel activator and a surface channel probe showed that a fraction of the bound toxin was internalized, since it was not releasable by acidic washing. Internalization was inhibited by tetrodotoxin, abolished in Na+-free medium, and induced by amphotericin B, a Na+ ionophore. Moreover, down-regulation occurred only in immature neuronal tissue, either cultured fetal neurons or postnatal hippocampal slices, but was absent in adult brain. These observations indicate that Na+ channel internalization is triggered by Na+ influx into neurons and may be involved in the control of electrical activity during development."

https://openalex.org/W2011626152,"A study was made of the role of G proteins in the K+ conductance increases elicited by cholinergic and glutamatergic agonists in identified Aplysia neurons. The cholinergic response, previously shown to be G protein mediated, was occluded by dialysis with either nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs (GTPγS or Gpp(NH)p) or beryllium fluoride and was blocked by pertussis toxin as well as by dialysis with a nonhydrolyzable GDP analog (GDPβS). In contrast, the glutamatergic response, studied simultaneously in the same cell, persisted throughout all of the above manipulations and hence does not appear to depend upon G protein activation. This characteristic differentiates the glutamatergic response from most other transmitter- or hormone-induced increases in K+ conductance elicited in either neurons or other cell types, whether vertebrate or invertebrate."
https://openalex.org/W1546394221,"We have detected an immunoglobulin heavy-chain trans-mRNA of the epsilon class in which the variable region of the human transgenic mu chain is correctly spliced to the first exon of the endogenous mouse epsilon constant region. Together with our previous observations, all the endogenous isotypes that are targets of class switching have proved to be expressed as trans-mRNA. This indicates that immunoglobulin trans-mRNA synthesis is a general mechanism to express a second heavy-chain isotype with the variable region of the transgenic mu chain. Synthesis of epsilon trans-mRNA is regulated in a way similar to the trans-mRNAs of the gamma subclasses or class switching to epsilon, i.e., interleukin-4 can induce the germline transcript of the epsilon constant region, but costimulation with lipopolysaccharide is necessary for epsilon trans-mRNA expression. The amount of epsilon trans-mRNA induced is similar to that of gamma 1 and higher than expected as judged from the rate of class switching to epsilon. All these data are consistent with our previous hypothesis that trans-mRNA is synthesized by a trans-splicing mechanism and that this mechanism is involved in the simultaneous multiple-isotype expression of immunoglobulin in a single B lymphocyte."
