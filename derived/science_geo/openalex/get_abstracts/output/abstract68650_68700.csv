https://openalex.org/W2086807063,"Spin echo nuclear magnetic resonance measurements may be used as a method for discriminating between malignant tumors and normal tissue. Measurements of spin-lattice (T(1)) and spin-spin (T(2)) magnetic relaxation times were made in six normal tissues in the rat (muscle, kidney, stomach, intestine, brain, and liver) and in two malignant solid tumors, Walker sarcoma and Novikoff hepatoma. Relaxation times for the two malignant tumors were distinctly outside the range of values for the normal tissues studied, an indication that the malignant tissues were characterized by an increase in the motional freedom of tissue water molecules. The possibility of using magnetic relaxation methods for rapid discrimination between benign and malignant surgical specimens has also been considered. Spin-lattice relaxation times for two benign fibroadenomas were distinct from those for both malignant tissues and were the same as those of muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1488620239,"Abstract A new sphingoglycolipid was isolated from human adenocarcinomas. The glycolipid had a novel ceramide which contained predominantly 4-hydroxysphinganine (phytosphingosine) and a high content of α-hydroxy fatty acids. The structure of the carbohydrate moiety was identified as O-β-galactosyl-(1 → 4)-[O-α-l-fucosyl-(1 → 3)]-O-β-(N-acetyl)glucosaminosyl-(1 → 3)-O-β-galactosyl-(1 → 4)-glucose, which was identical with that of lacto-N-fucopentaose III (Kobata, A., and Ginsburg, V., J. Biol. Chem., 244, 5496 (1969)). The precipitating antibody against this glycolipid was produced in rabbit, the antiserum was allowed to react specifically with this glycolipid but not with Lewis a or Lewis b glycolipid, and the precipitin reaction was inhibited by lacto-N-fucopentaose III."

The enzyme is shown to be homogeneous by equilibrium centrifugation and gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 32,360, with a v measured as 0.65 cc g-1. The homogeneous enzyme can be dissociated into two subunits, α and β, by sodium dodecyl sulfate. Subunit molecular weights, estimated from gel electrophoresis, are α = 8,000 and β = 26,500."

https://openalex.org/W2069080209,"The motor rhythm of ventilation in hermit crabs and lobsters appears to be controlled by a pair of neurons, one in each half of the subesophageal ganglion. Their membrane potentials oscillate and upon depolarization and hyperpolarization elicit spiking in two pools of motor neurons on each side, without spikes in the oscillator neurons themselves. The fact that higher order (command) interneurons can control the rate of the oscillator by means of a smoothly graded input lends support to the idea that oscillator neurons respond periodically to a constant ionic stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1502174044,"Abstract The interactions of four positively charged proteins, lysozyme, cytochrome c, ribonuclease, and poly-l-lysine, with negatively charged phosphatidylserine vesicles and vesicles consisting of a mixture of phosphatidylserine and neutral phosphatidylcholine were studied. Protein binding, as measured by spectrophotometric techniques for cytochrome c and microelectrophoresis, was correlated with effects on 22Na+ permeability. Lysozyme, cytochrome c, and poly-l-lysine markedly increased the 22Na+ permeability of sonically and mechanically dispersed vesicles, lysozyme being the most effective (up to 400-fold increase). Ribonuclease, although effective in decreasing electrophoretic mobility, had very little effect on permeability. When mixtures of 10% phosphatidylserine in phosphatidylcholine were used the amount of protein bound and the permeability changes were both decreased. Lysozyme and cytochrome c had no effect on the permeability of pure phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Both protein binding and permeability changes were also affected by alterations in ionic strength. The 22Na+ permeability increase induced by cytochrome c is not accompanied by a change in the activation energy for this process, which was found to be 27 to 29 kcal per mole. The same increases in permeability and high activation energy were observed when cytochrome c was added only outside or both inside and outside the vesicles. It is considered that the data presented are best explained by initial electrostatic interactions between protein and phospholipid, followed, to varying degrees, by other interactions leading to the observed changes in permeability."
https://openalex.org/W1650544568,"The regulation of ketogenesis in the rat has been studied both in vivo and in the isolated perfused liver with octanoic acid as substrate. This fatty acid, which is not utilized directly for triglyceride synthesis, was chosen in order to investigate the events that govern the metabolism of fatty acids subsequent to the β-oxidation process. Experiments in vivo established that for any given load of octanoate, fasted animals produced ketones at a much faster rate than normal animals and that insulin had no inhibitory effect on this response. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with the isolated perfused liver. Livers from alloxan diabetic rats produced ketones at maximal rates independent of the fatty acid concentration in the perfusion fluid. With high concentrations of octanoate, livers from fasted animals, unlike those from normal animals, could be induced to synthesize ketones at a rate approximately equal to that of the diabetic group. Perfusion studies with octanoate-1-14C revealed that the activity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, although modestly depressed in the ketotic state, exerted only a minor modulating influence on the rate of ketogenesis. Surprisingly, the depression of lipogenesis accompanying fasting was found to be of sufficient magnitude to account for a major proportion of the increased C2 unit flux into ketone bodies. The block in lipogenesis alone could not account for the markedly elevated rate of ketogenesis seen in the diabetic state in which an accelerated generation of acetyl-CoA appeared to be the dominant feature."
https://openalex.org/W1658821746,"Abstract Rates of rat liver glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase synthesis and degradation in vivo have been measured by following the time course for the induction of the enzyme by carbohydrate diets and insulin. If rats previously adapted to a commercial pellet diet are fed a 60% carbohydrate diet, the rate of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase synthesis increases up to 80-fold, and the first order rate constant for the degradation in vivo of the enzyme is increased 4.6-fold. The rate of synthesis of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase in these rats increases in proportion to the caloric consumption of carbohydrate, whether or not that carbohydrate is able to stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas. Although large doses of insulin are able to induce the synthesis of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase, this induction can be attributed to the ability of insulin to stimulate the appetite. It is concluded that insulin has no direct effect on the regulation of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase levels under our experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1509009826,"Evidence is presented that transglutaminase is composed of a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 80,000 to 90,000. (a) Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol gave a single band with a mobility corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 85,000. (b) Gel filtration in guanidine HCl of the 14C-carbamidomethyl carboxymethylated enzyme protein showed a single peak of absorbance and radioactivity from which a molecular weight of approximately 85,000 was estimated. (c) Amino-terminal analysis by conventional methods showed no evidence of free α-amino groups. A peptide, believed to contain the amino-terminal residue, was obtained by Pronase digestion and was isolated at levels of 0.75 and 0.8 mole/90,000 g of enzyme. The sequence of this peptide was determined as pyroglutamylalanylaspartylleucine. (d) Digestion by carboxypeptidase A of the carboxymethylated enzyme protein in denaturing solvents released glycine and serine at equal rates to the level of 1 mole/90,000 g of protein. Hydrazinolysis gave approximately 1 mole of glycine. These findings, together with earlier evidence that the molecular weight of the native enzyme is 80,000 to 90,000 and that the enzyme protein contains 17 or 18 —SH groups, but no disulfide bonds, form the basis for the view of an unbridged monomeric structure of transglutaminase. Indication that transglutaminase performs its catalytic functions in the monomeric form was obtained from a comparison of the gel filtration patterns for the enzyme protein in the presence and absence of calcium ion. The identical nature of these patterns is in accord with the suggestion that this metal, which is essential for activation of transglutaminase, does not affect a change in enzyme molecular weight. A revised enzyme purification procedure is presented. Rabbit antiserum against transglutaminase has been prepared and used to characterize the enzyme purified by this procedure as immunologically homogeneous."
https://openalex.org/W1608269403,"Abstract The stoichiometry of the reaction of cytochrome c peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide, and of the resulting Compound ES with both ferrocyanide and ferrocytochrome c as donor has been re-examined in detail over a wide pH range. It was confirmed that cytochrome c peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide react in a 1:1 molar ratio, and that 2 molecules of either donor are required to reduce Compound ES completely. The re-examination of the change in absorbance on formation of Compound ES gave a more reliable value of the difference extinction coefficient than those previously reported. It was established that the reaction of Compound ES with donors occurs in at least two stages of comparable rates. Comparison of optical and electron paramagnetic resonance titration curves showed that the two oxidizing equivalents of Compound ES were associated with distinct and partially independent changes in the properties of the enzyme. The rate of reaction of Compound ES with ferrocyanide was measured over the pH range 5 to 8, and the reaction was found to be biphasic. Several mechanisms were considered to account for these observations. All of the mechanisms involve an enzyme intermediate compound which is only one oxidizing equivalent above the native state. A theoretical analysis of the observed kinetics and titration curves showed that the data presently available do not unequivocally distinguish among all the proposed mechanisms. However, they strongly support a mechanism in which two one-oxidizing-equivalent intermediates are at rapid equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1488601849,"Abstract Specific progesterone-binding components are shown to be present in oviduct nuclei of estrogen-treated chicks. The macromolecular complex containing 3H-progesterone can be detected by sucrose gradient centrifugation and distinguished from chick plasma transcortin by Agarose gel filtration. The nuclear binding components behave identically to the cytoplasmic components previously described in our ultracentrifugal, chromatographic, and inactivation studies. The macromolecular-progesterone complex formed in vivo or in vitro can be extracted from nuclei by 0.3 m KCl. Little or no salt-extractable progesterone-binding activity can be detected in oviduct nuclei prior to progesterone administration. The binding molecules appear to exist initially in oviduct cytoplasm, where they presumably function as specific target tissue receptors. Following injection of 3H-progesterone in vivo or incubation of oviduct slices in vitro with 3H-progesterone, a progressive increase in nuclear binding occurs. The data indicate an absolute prerequisite for an initial interaction of the steroid with the cytoplasm, and a concomitant depletion of cytoplasmic receptor as nuclear binding increases. These results, and the apparent identity of the cytoplasmic and nuclear components, support the hypothesis that the nuclear macromolecular-steroid complex arises by a hormone-dependent transfer of the cytoplasmic receptor complex into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1512042406,"Abstract The conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin has been followed by means of the fluorescent probe, 2-p-toluidinonaphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS). It was found that the change in fluorescence accurately reflects the formation of active pepsin. The data on the binding of TNS to pepsinogen and pepsin suggest that the environment surrounding the fluorophore is altered during the conversion. One of the peptides released from the zymogen enhanced TNS-pepsin fluorescence and inhibited enzyme activity in the pH range 4.5 to 5.5. Fluorescence titration data showed that the observed binding phenomenon satisfied a mechanism of noncompetitive interaction between an enzyme and 2 smaller molecules, TNS and the inhibitor peptide which modified TNS-pepsin fluorescence. Dissociation constants of the pepsin-peptide complex, evaluated by measuring the increase in TNS fluorescence, ranged from 3 to 5 x 10-4 m in the pH range 4.5 to 5.5. Studies of the fluorescence intensity as a function of pH for the above systems suggested that the dissociation of the peptide from pepsin is essentially complete below pH 3.6. These findings suggest that binding of the activation peptide to pepsin alters the enzyme conformation near the TNS binding site."

The sensitivity of visual receptors in the carotenoid-depleted flies was lowered 3 log units, but the photosensitivity of the circadian rhythm was not affected. This result suggests that the chromophore of the photopigment which mediates light effects on the circadian rhythm is not a carotenoid derivative."
https://openalex.org/W1558310980,"Abstract Rhodopsin prepared from frozen bovine retinal tissue by washing the visual cell outer segment fraction with Tergitol XH and solubilizing in Triton X-100 contains approximately 91 µmoles of phospholipid per µmole of rhodopsin and shows spectral ratios (A278:A498 = 1.85;A400:A498 = 0.183) approaching those of the best preparations obtainable by chromatographic procedures. Removal of most of the phospholipid associated with the protein results in a decrease in the molar extinction coefficient at 498 mµ, an increase in the reactivity of sulfhydryl groups, and an inability of the visual pigment to be regenerated after bleaching. Regenerability after bleaching and the original pattern of sulfhydryl group reactivity are restored by addition of phosphatidylethanolamine to approximately 30 µmoles of phosphatidylethanolamine per µmole of rhodopsin. It is concluded that the properties of rhodopsin are sufficiently dependent upon associated phospholipid to support the view that rhodopsin is a lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1587199968,"Abstract A procedure is presented for measuring the relative amounts of the Mg2+ and Zn2+ forms of phosphoglucomutase in rabbit muscle extracts. The results indicate that the ratio of these forms in vivo is the same as that observed in extracts in vitro, viz., about 0.5 for mature Purdue Dutch rabbits; other phosphoglucomutase·metal species do not appear to be present in appreciable amounts. The concentration of free Mg2+ in such extracts is saturating with respect to phosphoglucomutase. These observations, together with metal binding data, provide estimates of the relative concentrations of free Mg2+ and free Zn2+ in vivo, about 106 to 1, and of the actual concentration of free Zn2+, about 10-10 m. The fraction of the total endogenous phosphoglucomutase in the Mg2+ form was essentially constant in animals treated alike; however, this fraction varied markedly in animals subjected to different treatments; viz., the fraction depended on the physiological state of the animal. Thus the fraction of the total enzyme in the Mg2+ form could be increased from about 0.35 ± 0.10 to about 0.83 ± 0.08 (S.D.) by treatment with insulin in fasting animals. By contrast, the total enzyme per ml of standard extract varied among animals by less than 8% (S.D.), regardless of treatment. Since the Zn2+ form of phosphoglucomutase is essentially inactive, these results indicate that the average catalytic efficiency of phosphoglucomutase can vary with the physiological state of the animals, while the total catalytic potential remains unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W1564838675,"Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase is inactivated by trinitrobenzene sulfonate, a compound known to attack amino and sulfhydryl groups in peptides. The inactivation reaction exhibits pseudo first order kinetics with respect to enzyme and is enhanced at high pH. The kinetic data indicate that one molecule of inhibitor reacts with each active unit of the enzyme. The modified enzyme was submitted to acid hydrolysis, and e-N-trinitrophenyllysine was identified as the product. Four lysyl residues undergo trinitrophenylation per molecule of pyruvate kinase, or one per enzyme subunit. ADP strongly protects the enzyme against inhibition by trinitrobenzene sulfonate, whereas K+ or Mg++ ions are only partially effective and phosphoenolpyruvate gives no protection. Pyruvate, lactate, and bicarbonate, which are known to occupy the P-enolpyruvate-binding site, also afford no protection, whereas ATP is as effective as ADP when tested under similar conditions. The Kd of ADP, determined by protection of the enzyme against the inhibitor, and the Km values of P-enolpyruvate and ADP for the partially inhibited enzyme are all similar to the same constants for the untreated native enzyme. From these results it is concluded that a lysyl e-amino group in each of the four enzyme subunits may be directly involved in the binding of ADP as well as in the catalytic activity of pyruvate kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1645532674,"Abstract Ghosts of a Bacillus sp. isolated from a culture of Bacillus megaterium KM were prepared by the lysozyme technique and found to be free of several typical cytoplasmic and cell wall components. All of the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol from phosphatidic acid were found to be present in the ghosts. The biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol was shown to proceed via CDP-diglyceride as a common intermediate. When synthesized in vitro this intermediate, as well as the end products, were found to be associated with the ghosts. In studies of the properties of the individual enzymes, it was found that all of the enzymatic activities were stimulated by addition of Mg++ and a nonionic detergent, and had similar pH optima."
https://openalex.org/W1599238750,"Abstract The pyridine nucleotide pool of Escherichia coli is made up almost exclusively of DPN and TPN. In an exponentially growing glucose culture an average cell contains 1,460,000 molecules of DPN (30% reduced) and 440,000 molecules of TPN (57% reduced). If the total volume of the cell were accessible to pyridine nucleotide, this would mean a total DPN concentration of 1.3 x 10-3 m and a TPN concentration of 3.9 x 10-4 m. During exponential growth, in an average cell, 550 DPN molecules are being synthesized from external niacin, 270 DPN molecules are being transformed to TPN, and 140 TPN molecules are being broken down (to DPN) each second."
https://openalex.org/W1546409767,"Abstract Polynucleotide ligase of bacteriophage T4, in contrast to the DNA ligase of Escherichia coli, catalyzes the joining of oligomers of deoxyribonucleotides hydrogen-bonded to complementary strands of either polydeoxyribonucleotides or polyribonucleotides. Hybrid molecules in which oligomers of ribonucleotides are hydrogen-bonded to complementary strands of polydeoxyribonucleotides can also serve as substrates for the T4 enzyme. The rate of joining of oligomers in hybrid molecules of this type is only 1 to 2% of that observed when both strands are polydeoxyribonucleotides. No activity has been detected when both strands are polyribonucleotides. The products of these reactions have been characterized by sedimentation and end group analysis; in all cases joining occurs through phosphodiester bond formation. The activities toward hybrid molecules and toward DNA containing single strand breaks appear to be identical as indicated by: (a) identical ratio of the activities during a 1000-fold purification, (b) similar reaction requirements, and (c) identical thermosensitivity of both activities purified from cells infected with a mutant bacteriophage containing a temperature-sensitive ligase. It had been shown previously that the introduction of an rII mutation into phage T4 could suppress an amber mutation in the ligase gene. In these studies it is shown that the double mutant, T4rIIamH39X, carrying an amber mutation in the ligase gene, does not have detectable levels of T4 ligase in the nonpermissive host. Similarly, T4rIItsA80, carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the ligase gene, can grow at the nonpermissive temperature, despite retaining its temperature-sensitive ligase."
https://openalex.org/W1557858418,"Abstract 11α,15-Dihydroxy-9-ketoprost-5-enoic acid formed from prostaglandin E2 with the soluble fraction of guinea pig liver homogenates was shown to have the l configuration at C-15. By incubation of prostaglandin E2 labeled with deuterium (inter alia) at C-15 and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis of the 11α,15l-dihydroxy-9-ketoprost-5-enoic acid formed, it was found that the latter compound was not formed by direct reduction of the Δ13 double bond of prostaglandin E2. On the basis of this finding, as well as on results of incubations of tritium-labeled 11α-hydroxy-9,15-diketoprost-5-enoic acid, 11α,15l-dihydroxy-9-ketoprost-5-enoic acid, and prostaglandin F2α, pathways in the metabolism of prostaglandin E2 in guinea pig liver were established."

https://openalex.org/W1493024010,"Abstract In Neurospora, carbamyl phosphate (carbamyl-P) is synthesized by two glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetases (EC 2.7.2.5): one specific for the arginine pathway (CP-synthetase A), and one specific for the pyrimidine pathway (CP-synthetase P). Mutants lacking CP-synthetase A require arginine, and those lacking CP-synthetase P require uridine. Experiments were designed to test for the existence of two pathway-specific carbamyl-P pools. A method for determining carbamyl-P pools in exponentially growing Neurospora mycelia was developed. Steady state values of about 6 nmoles of carbamyl-P per g, dry weight, were obtained from wild type mycelium grown in minimal medium. Mutants having only CP-synthetase P contained 0.4 nmole of carbamyl-P per g, and mutants having only CP-synthetase A contained about 3.5 nmoles of carbamyl-P per g. Double mutants lacking both CP-synthetases contained no detectable carbamyl-P. A strain starving for uridine as a result of a CP-synthetase P deficiency has a normal or somewhat elevated pool of carbamyl-P produced by CP-synthetase A. The results indicate a mechanism which normally segregates carbamyl-P of one pathway from the transcarbamylase of the other pathway. Impairment of transcarbamylase function, however, leads to a 10-fold elevation of the carbamyl-P associated with the pathway affected, and an overflow of carbamyl-P to the other pathway. The channeling mechanism, therefore, can be flooded by high carbamyl-P concentrations. The carbamyl-P associated with the pyrimidine sequence has a lower cellular concentration than the bifunctional enzyme complex carrying both CP-synthetase P and aspartate transcarbamylase activities. The complex could therefore confine pyrimidine-specific carbamyl-P as an enzyme-bound intermediate. Arginine-specific carbamyl-P may be confined in the mitochondrion, since a substantial fraction of CP-synthetase A and ornithine transcarbamylase is associated with this organelle in crude extracts. Regulation of the rate of arginine-specific carbamyl-P synthesis by arginine appears to take place mainly at the level of enzyme synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1541372733,"Abstract Blowfly flight muscle mitochondria differ markedly from mammalian mitochondria in their interaction with Ca2+. State 4 respiration of blowfly mitochondria is not stimulated by Ca2+, nor does Ca2+ induce a reversible shift in the oxidation-reduction state of cytochrome b. Nevertheless, Ca2+ is accumulated by respiring blowfly mitochondria, but with a low efficiency; the Ca2+: ∼ accumulation ratio is about 0.6 with pyruvate plus proline, and about 0.2 with glycerol 1-phosphate, compared with values of about 2.0 observed in mammalian mitochondria. Ca2+ uptake is blocked by respiratory chain inhibitors and by uncouplers, but not by oligomycin. The presence of permeant anions in the medium is essential for Ca2+ uptake by blowfly mitochondria. At high levels of Ca2+, phosphate supports Ca2+ uptake better than acetate, but at low Ca2+ levels, phosphate and acetate are equally effective. Since acetate penetrates blowfly mitochondria passively it is probable that respiration-coupled uptake of Ca2+ in blowfly mitochondria must be accompanied by passive entry of matching anions. The accumulation of Ca2+ by blowfly mitochondria is very slow and does not exhibit saturation kinetics; moreover, no high affinity Ca2+ sites characteristic of a specific Ca2+ carrier could be detected. For these reasons it is concluded that the respiration-dependent accumulation of Ca2+ in blowfly mitochondria is not mediated by a specific carrier, but occurs through slow, concentration-dependent, physical diffusion through the membrane, in response to an electrochemical gradient generated by electron transport. The number of low affinity Ca2+-binding sites is surprisingly low, about one-tenth of that found in mammalian mitochondrial, and has been related to the peculiar phospholipid composition of these mitochondria. The findings described strongly suggest that the mitochondria of blowfly flight muscle do not actively segregate Ca2+ at the low concentrations at which it is presumed to occur in the sarcoplasm in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1528485857,"Abstract The effects of 4-pentenoic acid on substrate oxidations and on the distribution of coenzyme A and its derivatives were studied in isolated rat liver mitochondria. CoA-linked substrate, long and short chain fatty acid, pyruvate, and α-ketoglutarate oxidations were inhibited 60 to 80% by 0.1 mm 4-pentenoic acid. The failure of 4-pentenoic acid to inhibit fatty acid oxidation in uncoupled mitochondria indicated that it was necessary for 4-pentenoic acid to be activated to its CoA ester to become inhibitory. Oxidation-reduction changes of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides and flavoproteins following 4-pentenoic acid addition showed that the inhibitor itself could undergo β oxidation. The addition of 4-pentenoic acid caused CoA and acetyl-CoA levels to decrease while acid-soluble and acid-insoluble acyl-CoA levels increased. The observed changes were interpreted as indicating that free CoA was being incorporated into a product of 4-pentenoic acid metabolism, and inhibition of fatty acid oxidation was caused by CoA depletion. These conclusions were supported by the reversal of 4-pentenoic acid inhibition of palmitylcarnitine oxidation in ultrasonically disrupted mitochondria by the addition of CoA, while oxidation of palmityl-CoA was not inhibited in this preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1591657801,"The fluorescence properties of glycogen phosphorylase b and its apoenzyme are described. At neutral pH the enzyme has two fluorescence bands: one caused by the protein moiety (maximum at 335 nm, quantum yield 0.12) and the other associated with the cofactor, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (maximum at 535 nm, quantum yield 0.012). Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate can be regarded as a native reporter group of phosphorylase. Therefore changes in its fluorescence as a function of pH made it possible to detect structural changes at the cofactor site which occurred around pH 5.3 and are not reflected in the fluorescence of the protein moiety or in the absorbance of the cofactor itself. On the other hand, the fluorescence of the protein moiety has a constant intensity in the pH range of 5 to 9.5. This plateau region of the curve coincides with the stability zone of the enzyme. With the protein fluorescence of the enzyme and the fluorescence of its cofactor, it was also possible to show the occurrence of transfer of excitation energy from the protein moiety to the cofactor (efficiency: 33%), the accessibility of water (or protons) to the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate site and to study structural relationships between phosphorylase and its apoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1506430275,"Abstract The mechanism of regulation of NADPH-ferredoxin reductase was studied in cell-free lysates of Clostridium kluyveri. The following activities, which are assumed to be linked to the enzyme, were investigated: ferredoxin reduction by NADPH, NADP+ reduction by reduced ferredoxin, transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD+, and methyl viologen reduction by NADPH. Ferredoxin reduction by NADPH is controlled by the oxidation-reduction state of the NAD+-NADH couple. NAD+ is an obligatory activator (Michaelis activation constant, Ka = 0.9 x 10-4 m), which increases Vmax, while the Km of the substrate NADPH (Km = 2.25 x 10-5 m) remains unaffected. β-NAD+ analogues can substitute to varying degrees for β-NAD+, while α-NAD+ and NMN or AMP analogues are totally inactive. NADH is an inhibitor, competitive to NAD+ rather than to NADPH. NADP+ reduction by reduced ferredoxin is subject to product inhibition; NADPH is competitive to NADP+ (Km = 1.52 x 10-4 m). The transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD+ is stimulated by oxidized and inhibited by reduced ferredoxin; ferredoxin is not involved in the electron flow. Methyl viologen reduction by NADPH is not controlled by either NAD+ or NADH."
https://openalex.org/W1488786057,"Abstract Protamine isolated from rainbow trout testis can be separated into three main components, Ci, Cii, and Ciii, by chromatography on microgranular carboxymethyl cellulose columns. After further purification by rechromatography on the same column, each component was analyzed for amino acid content. These analyses indicated that the components were distinct but closely related. However, each component still appeared heterogeneous since the number of residues of different amino acids assumed nonintegral values. The relative amounts of the protamine components present in spermatid nuclei were different at different stages of spermatogenesis. It appeared that the relative amount of Ci decreased while Ciii increased during testis maturation probably as the result of differing rates of synthesis of each component. The probable function of protamine is in the packaging of DNA into the sperm head. The independent synthesis of protamine components suggests that, in spite of their similarities, they may have different specific functions."
https://openalex.org/W1510184861,"Abstract Human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) was isolated in forms with K0.5 s values for phosphoenolpyruvate which range from 3 x 10-5 m to greater than 10-3 m. Several activity peaks also were obtained when samples were subjected to Sephadex G-200 chromatography, sucrose gradient sedimentation, or starch gel electrophoresis. The most prevalent peak had a molecular weight of 237,000 ± 1,680 S.E. when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography and 214,000 ± 2,700 S.E. when subjected to sedimentation studies. Assuming this to be a tetrameric form, evidence was also obtained for possible monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric forms. Enzyme maintained at pH values below 7.0 had K0.5 s values for phosphoenolpyruvate of less than 8 x 10-5 m, gave hyperbolic rate curves, and was 80% or better apparent tetramer. This form could be reversibly converted to a form which had K0.5 s values for phosphoenolpyruvate of about 2.0 x 10-4 m by aging in alkaline pH or purifying on DEAE-cellulose columns. Such preparations appeared to consist primarily of apparent trimer and could be converted back to the lower K0.5 s apparent tetrameric form by aging in solutions with pH values less than 7.0 or by incubating with fructose 1,6-diphosphate. In addition to this apparent R ⇌ T conformational pair, a form of the enzyme with a K0.5 s value for phosphoenolpyruvate greater than 7 x 10-4 m was also obtained from outdated cells. This form of the enzyme could exist in solutions with other forms, but it could not be reconverted to lower K0.5 s forms by exposure to acidic solutions. Another apparently distinct form of enzyme was found in lysates of fresh blood cells. This differed from any of those previously described in that the K0.5 s and nh values (Hill coefficient) obtained with phosphoenolpyruvate as the variable substrate were highly dependent upon the ADP concentration and in that the apparent dimeric form predominated in Sephadex and starch gel studies."
https://openalex.org/W1576825074,"Abstract The amino acid composition of Chalaropsis lysozyme (221 residues) is: Lys, 4; His, 4; Arg, 5; Asp, 23; Thr, 18; Ser, 21; Glu, 11; Pro, 12; Gly, 29; Ala, 27; Val, 8; Met, 3; Ile, 12; Leu, 10; Tyr, 14; Phe, 11; Cys, 2; Trp, 7; and amide ammonia, 23. The calculated molecular weight is 23,385. Tryptophan was determined by both spectrophotometric and chemical methods. Cystine was determined as cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation. Chalaropsis lysozyme contains a single disulfide bridge. Threonine is the NH2 terminus. Carboxypeptidase A released, at identical rates, 1 mole per mole each of leucine, threonine, alanine, and glycine from performic acid-oxidized enzyme. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of lysozyme Ch yields the four peptides expected from the methionine content of 3 residues per molecule. The four peptides were separated by gel filtration chromatography and were ordered to give a partial structural formula. The molecule is clearly very different in over-all structure from that of egg white lysozyme or T4 phage lysozyme."
https://openalex.org/W1517450306,Abstract A 21-member tryptic peptide containing covalently bound adenylic acid has been isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography from Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase. The amino acid sequence of the peptide is [see PDF for sequence] Analysis of a thermolysin fragment of the heneicosapeptide containing uniformly labeled 14C-AMP revealed that the radioactivity of the ribose moiety of the AMP is released from the peptide along with tyrosine during the Edman degradation. This establishes that tyrosine is the amino acid residue to which the AMP is covalently bound.
https://openalex.org/W1522622603,"Previously reported isopycnic centrifugation techniques with swinging bucket and angle head rotors for the separation of brain synaptic complexes in a generated cesium chloride gradient were modified to permit large scale preparations in a zonal rotor. Zonal ultracentrifugation in such gradients separated a crude mitochondrial fraction into three major components at densities of 1.16, 1.17 to 1.18, and 1.21. The intact synaptic complexes were found, by electron microscopic examination, to band isopycnically at 1.17 to 1.18. Furthermore, the intact synaptic junctional complexes recovered at this density were stabilized by the presence of 0.14 m sucrose in the cesium chloride gradient. The chemical composition of the three isopycnic bands were assayed for norepinephrine, N-acetylneuraminic acid, phospholipid, cholesterol, and proteolipid. The activities of glutamine synthetase, glutaminase, and glutamic decarboxylase were also determined in these fractions. The chemical and metabolic properties of the synaptic complexes are discussed in relation to those of synaptosomes prepared by other methods."
https://openalex.org/W1603613443,"Abstract A purification procedure has been devised for phosphoribosyltransferase, the l-histidine-sensitive first enzyme in the pathway for histidine biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium. The procedure was applied to a wild type and a feedback-resistant strain. The enzymes from both strains appeared nearly homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge and upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate. The enzymes had similar sedimentation coefficients in the ultracentrifuge and similar mobilities on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. Tryptic peptide maps of the two enzymes could not be distinguished. The wild type enzyme gave regular Michaelis-Menten kinetics but initial velocity analysis at a constant optimal magnesium to ATP ratio (2:1) gave nonparallel lines on double reciprocal plots. l-Histidine was an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, while it was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to ATP. The curves for l-histidine and l-thiazolealanine inhibition were sigmoid in shape, and conversion to Hill plots gave straight lines with slopes of 1.6 and 1.8, respectively. Inhibition by both effectors was pH-dependent. The reverse reaction was also inhibited by l-histidine. A difference spectrum of the wild type enzyme showed a striking increase in absorbance at 280 mµ upon the addition of l-histidine, whereas that of the feedback-resistant enzyme remained constant following the addition of l-histidine."
https://openalex.org/W148165786,"Abstract The behavior of interacting macromolecules undergoing transport on molecular sieve columns (gel chromatography) has been investigated by computer simulation. Equations for chromatographic transport of multicomponent interacting solutes have been formulated to include axial dispersion effects within gel columns. Useful frames of reference for the expression of concentration, solute fluxes, and equilibrium constants have been described and flow equations for the total column volume frame of reference have been developed in detail. In this frame of reference, solute concentrations and fluxes are represented with respect to the total column as it would be seen by direct optical scanning. Relationships are presented which transform quantities from this frame of reference into corresponding quantities in the free solution frame of reference, which is most suitable for the description of elution chromatography. Numerical solutions of the flow equations have been obtained by the simulation method of Cox (Cox, D. J., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 129, 106 (1969)). Resulting concentration profiles are presented for a reversibly dimerizing system. Axial dispersion coefficients and other column parameters used in the simulations are based on typical experimental values and experimentally verified relationships. The parameters investigated by simulation include development time, column flow rate, degree of molecular association, gel porosity, and gel particle size."
https://openalex.org/W1559691538,"Abstract GTP cyclohydrolase, the first enzyme in pteridine biosynthesis, has been purified from cell-free extracts of Comamonas sp. (ATCC 11299a). A 20-fold purification was obtained using ammonium sulfate fractionation, adsorption on calcium phosphate gel, and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. Because of extreme instability, less than 2% of the total activity was generally recovered. The enzyme can be assayed by its ability to produce formic acid from C-8 of GTP. This activity requires Mg++, and the magnesium requirement is quite specific. The activity is markedly increased by preliminary incubation of the enzyme with sulfhydryl compounds, and this activation is prevented by GTP, but not by Mg++. No inhibitors or effectors have been observed. The major pteridine product has absorption and fluorescence properties similar to those of neopterin. The presence of phosphate has been shown by the use of GT32P as substrate. The product at this stage of purification appears to be a cyclic phosphate of neopterin (2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-trihydroxypropyl pteridine). Chemical and enzymatic evidence for this structure has been obtained. The properties and products of this enzyme are different than those of a previously described enzyme of similar function from E. coli. The possible reasons for the production of a cyclic phosphate by Comamonas are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1495358676,"Abstract Several polynucleotides were reacted with N-acetoxy-N-2-acetylaminofluorene, repurified, and their base compositions analyzed after ribonuclease T2 digestion. This led to the binding of N-2-acetylaminofluorene at the position 8 of guanosine residues in the valine codon, G-U-U, the lysine codon, A-A-G, and in poly(U3,G). This modification completely inactivated the ability of the triplets to stimulate ribosomal binding of their respective aminoacyl transfer RNAs. No miscoding was observed. The modified poly(U3,G) had decreased activity with 14C-valyl-tRNA, but normal activity with 14C-phenylalanyl-tRNA, in the ribosomal binding assay. Employing the same polymer in a protein-synthesizing system, the incorporation of both 14C-valine and 14C-phenylalanine into polypeptides was inhibited. Evidence was obtained that polymers with modified G residues are bound to ribosomes but that polypeptide chain growth is blocked when translation encounters the modified G residues."

https://openalex.org/W1550997664,"It has been found at pH 6.9 that above 0.5 m potassium chloride the dependence of ΔF° on salt concentration for α-chymotrypsin-substrate complex formation is explainable by assuming no effect is exerted on the enzyme, the only important term being the salting-out effect of the added potassium chloride upon the chemical potential of the substrate which tends to squeeze the substrate from the solution phase to the enzyme as the ionic strength is raised. The above parallel between ΔF° for the solution process and ΔF° for enzyme-substrate complex formation is also observed for ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔC p , hence, it is positively established that the salt effect upon the association constant is exerted only upon the substrate and not upon the enzyme at ionic strengths above 0.5 m . This situation does not hold at ionic strengths below 0.5 m . In this range it has been found that the kinetics observed are satisfactorily explained by postulating a salt-dependent equilibrium between two conformational forms of the enzyme. At this slightly acid pH, kcat, the over-all decomposition constant for the enzyme-substrate complex, is essentially independent of ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W1577532966,"Abstract The relative reactivities to iodination of the variable region tyrosines of a κ Bence-Jones protein, Col, were found to be in the order 49 g 91 g 36, 86 g 87, with tyrosine 87 completely unreactive. The relative reactivities of all of the tyrosines of Protein Col are concluded to be 173 >> 49 g 91 g 186, 192, 36, 86, 140 g 87. Histidine 198 is more reactive than histidine 189. The parts of the polypeptide chain containing tyrosines 173, 49, and 91 appear to be close enough to the surface of the molecule to expose these tyrosines to the solvent since they are reactive with iodine. On the other hand, tyrosine 87 appears to be buried. These findings were based on a study of the iodotyrosine and iodohistidine peptides from radioiodinated Protein Col. Several paper chromatography and electrophoresis systems for separating iodopeptides were established. This protein contains four tyrosines and two histidines in the constant region and five tyrosines in the variable region. Seventeen iodopeptides were isolated and account for the nine tyrosines and both histidines. Of these 17 iodopeptides, eight contained only monoiodotyrosine as the iodinated residue, six contained only diiodotyrosine, two contained only monoiodohistidine, and one contained one intact tyrosine, one monoiodotyrosine, and one diiodotyrosine. One of the monoiodoand one of the diiodotyrosine peptides were shown to contain one intact tyrosine in addition to the one iodotyrosine. An assignment of the position of the iodinated residue in each of these iodopeptides in the sequence of Protein Col was made on the bases of the characterization of the iodopeptides and of the published sequences of other κ Bence-Jones proteins. The identification of the residues iodinated in other κ Bence-Jones proteins will be greatly facilitated by the characterization of the iodopeptides reported here. The chymotryptic activity of l-(1-tosylamido-2-phenyl)ethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin which is frequently overlooked was made apparent by the high sensitivity of the radioiodine label used."
https://openalex.org/W1973448942,"Rabbits were immunized both with lysozyme and with dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin. No antibodies against the dinitrophenyl hapten were produced when cell suspensions of their spleens were exposed in vitro to dinitro-phenyl-ovalbumin, whereas a positive response was obtained with dinitrophenyl-lysozyme. Moreover, when spleen cells from rabbits previously immunized with dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin were exposed in vitro to bovine serum albumin alone, they produced antibodies against the dinitrophenyl hapten."
https://openalex.org/W1606012542,"Abstract The interpretation of kinetic data for complex formation between the enzyme, α-chymotrypsin, and the substrate, methyl hippurate (described fully in the preceding paper), involves a change in conformation or structure of the enzyme when potassium chloride is added up to concentrations of 0.5 m; beyond this concentration it was suggested that no further change in the enzyme takes place. The physical evidence for what appears to be a conformational change is presented in this report. Continuous variation experiments using the refractive index and ultraviolet absorption as the measured parameters indicate an interaction between the enzyme and the salt; the nonlinear curves cross at 0.5 m ionic strength. Ultraviolet absorption at 282.5 mµ, optical rotation of the Cotton effect at 233 mµ, and the ellipticity at 231 mµ of the circular dichroism spectra of α-chymotrypsin change in a similar manner when potassium chloride is added. These values all increase up to an ionic strength of 0.5 m and then become independent of salt concentration, which correlates very well with the kinetic data. The helical content of the peptide chain appears to increase upon addition of potassium chloride. It is proposed that the binding area of the enzyme which is dependent on ion pairing between isoleucine 16 and aspartate 194 is that which is involved in hydrophobic binding of the aromatic moiety of the substrate. Some possible relationships of the findings to the known crystallographic structure of the enzyme are suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1520576183,"Abstract Ferredoxin stimulated the transhydrogenase activity of ferredoxin-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reductase and reversed the inhibition due to factors in boiled spinach extracts. The percentage stimulation by ferredoxin was pH-dependent. Ferredoxin had little effect at the pH optimum (8.8), but the stimulation increased as the pH was lowered. At pH 7.0 a 5-fold stimulation of the transhydrogenase activity was demonstrated. Under these conditions the maximal stimulation occurred on addition of 1 molecule of ferredoxin to 3 to 6 molecules of the flavoprotein."
