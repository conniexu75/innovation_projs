https://openalex.org/W2029842534,"The oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes with O 2 in place of stoichiometric oxygen donors is a crucial process for the synthesis of fine chemicals. However, the catalysts that have been identified so far are relatively inactive with primary alkyl alcohols. We showed that Au/Pd-TiO 2 catalysts give very high turnover frequencies (up to 270,000 turnovers per hour) for the oxidation of alcohols, including primary alkyl alcohols. The addition of Au to Pd nanocrystals improved the overall selectivity and, using scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we showed that the Au-Pd nanocrystals were made up of a Au-rich core with a Pd-rich shell, indicating that the Au electronically influences the catalytic properties of Pd."

It has not only hindered our treatment of infections but also dramatically reshaped drug discovery, yet its origins have not been systematically studied. Soil-dwelling bacteria produce and encounter a myriad of antibiotics, evolving corresponding sensing and evading strategies. They are a reservoir of resistance determinants that can be mobilized into the microbial community. Study of this reservoir could provide an early warning system for future clinically relevant antibiotic resistance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2005311687,"The sequence and the structure of DNA methyltransferase-2 (Dnmt2) bear close affinities to authentic DNA cytosine methyltransferases. A combined genetic and biochemical approach revealed that human DNMT2 did not methylate DNA but instead methylated a small RNA; mass spectrometry showed that this RNA is aspartic acid transfer RNA (tRNA(Asp)) and that DNMT2 specifically methylated cytosine 38 in the anticodon loop. The function of DNMT2 is highly conserved, and human DNMT2 protein restored methylation in vitro to tRNA(Asp) from Dnmt2-deficient strains of mouse, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Drosophila melanogaster in a manner that was dependent on preexisting patterns of modified nucleosides. Indirect sequence recognition is also a feature of eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases, which may have arisen from a Dnmt2-like RNA methyltransferase."

https://openalex.org/W2108878769,"Molecular electronics is often limited by the poorly defined nature of the contact between the molecules and the metal surface. We describe a method to wire molecules into gaps in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Precise oxidative cutting of a SWNT produces carboxylic acid-terminated electrodes separated by gaps of </=10 nanometers. These point contacts react with molecules derivatized with amines to form molecular bridges held in place by amide linkages. These chemical contacts are robust and allow a wide variety of molecules to be tested electrically. In addition to testing molecular wires, we show how to install functionality in the molecular backbone that allows the conductance of the single-molecule bridges to switch with pH."
https://openalex.org/W2059288596,"Surface conditions on Mars are currently cold and dry, with water ice unstable on the surface except near the poles. However, geologically recent glacierlike landforms have been identified in the tropics and the midlatitudes of Mars. The ice has been proposed to originate from either a subsurface reservoir or the atmosphere. We present high-resolution climate simulations performed with a model designed to simulate the present-day Mars water cycle but assuming a 45° obliquity as experienced by Mars a few million years ago. The model predicts ice accumulation in regions where glacier landforms are observed, on the western flanks of the great volcanoes and in the eastern Hellas region. This agreement points to an atmospheric origin for the ice and reveals how precipitation could have formed glaciers on Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2140493627,"The stable propagation of genetic material during cell division depends on the congression of chromosomes to the spindle equator before the cell initiates anaphase. It is generally assumed that congression requires that chromosomes are connected to the opposite poles of the bipolar spindle (“bioriented”). In mammalian cells, we found that chromosomes can congress before becoming bioriented. By combining the use of reversible chemical inhibitors, live-cell light microscopy, and correlative electron microscopy, we found that monooriented chromosomes could glide toward the spindle equator alongside kinetochore fibers attached to other already bioriented chromosomes. This congression mechanism depended on the kinetochore-associated, plus end–directed microtubule motor CENP-E (kinesin-7)."

https://openalex.org/W2054661742,"Mammalian X inactivation turns off one female X chromosome to enact dosage compensation between XX and XY individuals. X inactivation is known to be regulated in cis by Xite, Tsix , and Xist , but in principle the two Xs must also be regulated in trans to ensure mutually exclusive silencing. Here, we demonstrate that interchromosomal pairing mediates this communication. Pairing occurs transiently at the onset of X inactivation and is specific to the X-inactivation center. Deleting Xite and Tsix perturbs pairing and counting/choice, whereas their autosomal insertion induces de novo X-autosome pairing. Ectopic X-autosome interactions inhibit endogenous X-X pairing and block the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation. Thus, Tsix and Xite function both in cis and in trans. We propose that Tsix and Xite regulate counting and mutually exclusive choice through X-X pairing."

https://openalex.org/W2033766516,"Successful ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) would greatly benefit the treatment of disease and the understanding of crucial questions of stem cell biology. Here we show, using microarray studies, that the HSC-supportive mouse fetal liver CD3(+) cells specifically express the proteins angiopoietin-like 2 (Angptl2) and angiopoietin-like 3 (Angptl3). We observed a 24- or 30-fold net expansion of long-term HSCs by reconstitution analysis when we cultured highly enriched HSCs for 10 days in the presence of Angptl2 or Angptl3 together with saturating levels of other growth factors. The coiled-coil domain of Angptl2 was capable of stimulating expansion of HSCs. Furthermore, angiopoietin-like 5, angiopoietin-like 7 and microfibril-associated glycoprotein 4 also supported expansion of HSCs in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2025565421,"Plants and some animals have a profound capacity to regenerate organs from adult tissues. Molecular mechanisms for regeneration have, however, been largely unexplored. Here we investigate a local regeneration response in Arabidopsis roots. Laser-induced wounding disrupts the flow of auxin—a cell-fate–instructive plant hormone—in root tips, and we demonstrate that resulting cell-fate changes require the PLETHORA, SHORTROOT, and SCARECROW transcription factors. These transcription factors regulate the expression and polar position of PIN auxin efflux–facilitating membrane proteins to reconstitute auxin transport in renewed root tips. Thus, a regeneration mechanism using embryonic root stem-cell patterning factors first responds to and subsequently stabilizes a new hormone distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2059455398,"Does geometry constitute a core set of intuitions present in all humans, regardless of their language or schooling? We used two nonverbal tests to probe the conceptual primitives of geometry in the Mundurukú, an isolated Amazonian indigene group. Mundurukú children and adults spontaneously made use of basic geometric concepts such as points, lines, parallelism, or right angles to detect intruders in simple pictures, and they used distance, angle, and sense relationships in geometrical maps to locate hidden objects. Our results provide evidence for geometrical intuitions in the absence of schooling, experience with graphic symbols or maps, or a rich language of geometrical terms."
https://openalex.org/W2146491521,"Proteins containing ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) interact with ubiquitinated targets and regulate diverse biological processes, including endocytosis, signal transduction, transcription and DNA repair1,2,3. Many of the UBD-containing proteins are also themselves monoubiquitinated, but the functional role and the mechanisms that underlie this modification are less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that monoubiquitination of the endocytic proteins Sts1, Sts2, Eps15 and Hrs results in intramolecular interactions between ubiquitin and their UBDs, thereby preventing them from binding in trans to ubiquitinated targets. Permanent monoubiquitination of these proteins, mimicked by the fusion of ubiquitin to their carboxyl termini, impairs their ability to regulate trafficking of ubiquitinated receptors. Moreover, we mapped the in vivo monoubiquitination site in Sts2 and demonstrated that its mutation enhances the Sts2-mediated effects of epidermal-growth-factor-receptor downregulation. We propose that monoubiquitination of ubiquitin-binding proteins inhibits their capacity to bind to and control the functions of ubiquitinated targets in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2065879859,"Nonwoven fibrous membranes were formed from electrospinning lecithin solutions in a single processing step. As the concentration of lecithin increased, the micellar morphology evolved from spherical to cylindrical, and at higher concentrations the cylindrical micelles overlapped and entangled in a fashion similar to polymers in semi-dilute or concentrated solutions. At concentrations above the onset of entanglements of the wormlike micelles, electrospun fibers were fabricated with diameters on the order of 1 to 5 micrometers. The electrospun phospholipid fibers offer the potential for direct fabrication of biologically based, high-surface-area membranes without the use of multiple synthetic steps, complicated electrospinning designs, or postprocessing surface treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2163680039,"Scaffold proteins organize signaling proteins into pathways and are often viewed as passive assembly platforms. We found that the Ste5 scaffold has a more active role in the yeast mating pathway: A fragment of Ste5 allosterically activated autophosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Fus3. The resulting form of Fus3 is partially active-it is phosphorylated on only one of two key residues in the activation loop. Unexpectedly, at a systems level, autoactivated Fus3 appears to have a negative regulatory role, promoting Ste5 phosphorylation and a decrease in pathway transcriptional output. Thus, scaffolds not only direct basic pathway connectivity but can precisely tune quantitative pathway input-output properties."
https://openalex.org/W1976859962,"Helical spin order in magnetic materials has been investigated only in reciprocal space. We visualized the helical spin order and dynamics in a metal silicide in real space by means of Lorentz electron microscopy. The real space of the helical spin order proves to be much richer than that expected from the averaged structure; it exhibits a variety of magnetic defects similar to atomic dislocations in the crystal lattice. The application of magnetic fields allows us to directly observe the deformation processes of the helical spin order accompanied by nucleation, movement, and annihilation of the magnetic defects."

https://openalex.org/W2105222529,"During DNA replication one or both strands transiently become single stranded: first at the sites where initiation of DNA synthesis occurs (known as origins of replication) and subsequently on the lagging strands of replication forks as discontinuous Okazaki fragments are generated. We report a genome-wide analysis of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) formation in the presence of hydroxyurea during DNA replication in wild-type and checkpoint-deficient rad53 Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. In wild-type cells, ssDNA was first observed at a subset of replication origins and later 'migrated' bi-directionally, suggesting that ssDNA formation is associated with continuously moving replication forks. In rad53 cells, ssDNA was observed at virtually every known origin, but remained there over time, suggesting that replication forks stall. Telomeric regions seemed to be particularly sensitive to the loss of Rad53 checkpoint function. Replication origins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe were also mapped using our method."
https://openalex.org/W2146044361,"Brain inflammation is characterized by a reactive gliosis involving the activation of astrocytes and microglia. This process, common to many brain injuries and diseases, underlies important phenotypic changes in these two glial cell types. One characteristic feature of astrocytes is their high level of intercellular communication mediated by gap junctions. Previously, we have reported that astrocyte gap junctional communication (AGJC) and the expression of connexin 43 (Cx43), the main constitutive protein of gap junctions, are inhibited in microglia (MG)-astrocyte cocultures. Here, we report that bacterial lipopolysaccharide activation of microglia increases their inhibitory effect on Cx43 expression and AGJC. This inhibition is mimicked by treating astrocyte cultures with conditioned medium harvested from activated microglia. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were identified as being the main factors responsible for this conditioned medium-mediated activity. Interestingly, an inflammatory response characterized by MG activation and reactive astrocytes occurs in Alzheimer's disease, at sites of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits. We found that this peptide potentiates the inhibitory effect of a conditioned medium diluted at a concentration that is not effective per se. This potentiation is prevented by treating astrocytes with specific blockers of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha activities. Thus, the suppression of communication between astrocytes, induced by activated MG could contribute to the proposed role of reactive gliosis in this neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W1999257669,"Drosophila peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-LCx and -LCa are receptors that preferentially recognize meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan (PGN) present in Gram-negative bacteria over lysine-type PGN of Gram-positive bacteria and initiate the IMD signaling pathway, whereas PGRP-LE plays a synergistic role in this process of innate immune defense. How these receptors can distinguish the two types of PGN remains unclear. Here the structure of the PGRP domain of Drosophila PGRP-LE in complex with tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), the monomeric DAP-type PGN, reveals a buried ionic interaction between the unique carboxyl group of DAP and a previously unrecognized arginine residue. This arginine is conserved in the known DAP-type PGN-interacting PGRPs and contributes significantly to the affinity of the protein for the ligand. Unexpectedly, TCT induces infinite head-to-tail dimerization of PGRP-LE, in which the disaccharide moiety, but not the peptide stem, of TCT is positioned at the dimer interface. A sequence comparison suggests that TCT induces heterodimerization of the ectodomains of PGRP-LCx and -LCa in a closely analogous manner to prime the IMD signaling pathway, except that the heterodimer formation is nonperpetuating.

Innate immune defenses against pathogens are initiated by pattern recognition receptors that bind conserved stereotypical, rather than particular, molecular structures present in a wide spectrum of microorganisms but absent in the host (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Science. 2002; 296: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar). A representative example of such structures is peptidoglycan (PGN) 3The abbreviations used are: PGN, peptidoglycan; DAP, meso-diaminopimelic acid; IMD, immune deficiency; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; MurNAc(anh), anhydro form of N-acetylmuramic acid; PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition protein; TCT, tracheal cytotoxin. , the major constituent of the cell wall of both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) family is a class of pattern recognition receptors that bind, and sometimes cleave, PGN. A total of 13 and four PGRP family members have been identified in Drosophila and humans, respectively (2Werner T. Liu G. Kang D. Ekengren S. Steiner H. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). PGRPs are often characterized based on their polypeptide length. Short form PGRPs, such as PGRP-SA and -SD, contain a single PGRP domain (∼180 amino acids) and, in most cases, a signal sequence, leading to the secretion of the proteins. Long form PGRPs, such as PGRP-LC and -LE, contain other domain(s) in addition to the PGRP domain, often including a transmembrane region (6Dziarski R. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The PGRP domain is similar in structure to N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases, such as T7 lysozyme, and some PGRPs are similarly catalytic, whereas others lack a critical cysteine residue in the catalytic triad (7Kim M.S. Byun M. Oh B.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, these PGRPs lack catalytic activity but function instead as pattern recognition receptors and/or as antimicrobials. For example, murine PGRP-S is directly antimicrobial and contributes to the neutrophil-mediated killing of bacteria (8Cho J.H. Fraser I.P. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Fujimoto Y. Stahl G.L. Ezekowitz R.A.

In particular, genetic studies revealed that circulating PGRP-SA and PGRP-SD detect Gram-positive bacteria and activate the Toll pathway (17Michel T. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J.

Analysis of mutant flies in response to bacterial infection and a knockdown experiment using RNA interference showed that PGRP-LC is the major receptor in the IMD pathway, and PGRP-LE acts in parallel and synergistically with PGRP-LC (24Kaneko T.

Borge-Renberg K. Mellroth P. Steiner H. Hultmark D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26319-26322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of the three isoforms are identical and physically interact with the death domain protein IMD to activate downstream signaling (26Choe K.M. Lee H. Anderson K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas their ectodomains are unique, sharing less than 40% sequence identity with each other (3Werner T. Borge-Renberg K. Mellroth P. Steiner H. Hultmark D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26319-26322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PGRP-LE is a two-domain protein composed of the N-terminal acidic domain with unknown function and the C-terminal PGRP domain, which preferentially binds Gram-negative bacterial PGN (23Takehana A.

PGRP-LE is devoid of a transmembrane domain and probably functions as an intracellular receptor for TCT 4T. Kaneko, S. Kurata, and N. Silverman, unpublished results. as well as an extracellular factor capable of recognizing PGN (25Takehana A. Yano T. Mita S. Kotani A. Oshima Y. Kurata S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4690-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). PGRP-LE is also required for activation of the prophenoloxidase cascade, the most immediate response to microbial infection or septic injury (25Takehana A. Yano T. Mita S. Kotani A. Oshima Y. Kurata S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4690-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The cascade leads to the production of melanin, which immobilizes the microorganism and contains the infection (6Dziarski R. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). PGN is a polymer consisting of glycan chains of alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) residues attached to short peptide stems. To a varying degree, these stem peptides are also cross-linked to each other via a variety of peptide linkages. A critical distinction between Gram-negative bacterial or Bacillus PGNs and other Gram-positive bacterial PGNs is the presence of meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) in the third position of the peptide stem in the former instead of lysine found in the latter (29Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DAP-type PGN is a potent activator of the IMD pathway, whereas Lys-type PGN is much less effective (24Kaneko T.

Intriguingly, a monomeric DAP-type PGN, GlcNAc-MurNAc(anh)-l-Ala-d-isoGlu-meso-DAP-d-Ala, also activates the IMD pathway potently as polymeric DAP-type PGN (24Kaneko T. Goldman W.E. Mellroth P.

The monomeric PGN, known as tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), is continuously released from some Gram-negative bacteria, including Bordetella pertussis, in the course of turnover and recycling of the cell wall PGN (33Park J.T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3842-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recognition of the diffusible monomeric PGN should be advantageous in detecting Gram-negative pathogens, since their PGN layer is buried underneath the outer cell membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, whereas Gram-positive bacterial PGN is largely exposed. The selective activation of the either Toll or IMD immune signaling pathway relies on the ability of Drosophila to recognize specific forms of PGN (30Leulier F. Parquet C. Pili-Floury S. Ryu J.H.

They provided important insights into the structural bases for the zinc-dependent amidase activity or the ld-carboxypeptidase activity contained in some members of the PGRP family and for the recognition of PGN in the binding groove. However, the mechanisms of discrimination for DAP-versus lysine-type PGN remain unknown, and the molecular mechanisms whereby PGN recognition by PGRPs leads signal transduction are unclear. We determined the structure of the PGRP domain of Drosophila PGRP-LE in complex with TCT to 2.4 Å resolution. The presented structure reveals the first full picture of the binding of a complete monomeric PGN to a PGRP and provides a structural basis for the discrimination of PGN types by different PGRPs. The structure also suggests a mechanism of the IMD pathway activation by monomeric as well as polymeric DAP-type PGN through PGRP-LC. Plasmid Construction and Preparation of PGRP-LE—The gene segment coding for the PGRP domain (residues 173-345) of Drosophila PGRP-LE was cloned into the pPROEx HTa vector (Invitrogen) by a standard polymerase chain reaction method, and the resulting recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Bacterial lysate was prepared by sonication in buffer A consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). The column was washed with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole and subsequently washed with a 1:1 mixture of buffer A and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (pH 8.0). This step for mild protein denaturation was essential to yield a homogeneous form of the protein in subsequent purification steps. The column was washed with buffer A for on-resin protein renaturation. The bound protein was eluted with buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole and then subjected to TEV protease cleavage to remove the N-terminal His6 tag. The protein was further purified with a linear gradient of 0.1-1 m NaCl on a Hitrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and finally by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 3 mm dithiothreitol. All of the PGRP-LE mutants used in this study were created using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and purified as described above except for the denaturation-renaturation step, which was dispensable due to their weaker affinity for PGN fragments or TCT. Crystallization and Structure Determination—The PGRP domain of PGRP-LE was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing and equilibrating 1.5 μl of each of the protein solution (30-40 mg/ml) and a precipitant solution containing 10% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0-7.6). Cubic crystals grew at 23 °C in 1-2 days. To obtain the crystals of the protein in complex with TCT, 0.2 μl of TCT dissolved in the reservoir solution at 50 mm was added to the hanging drops. Before data collection, the crystals were immersed briefly in a cryoprotectant solution, which was the reservoir solution plus 21% glycerol. A diffraction data set was collected on beamline 4A at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory and processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (39Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). The structure was determined by the molecular replacement method with the CCP4 version of MolRep (40Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) using the structure of PGRP-LB (Protein Data Bank code 1OHT) as a search model. The solution consisted of four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The resulting model was refined in conjunction with model rebuilding using the programs CNS (41Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Caroff M. Lee W.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Lemaitre B. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In brief, E. coli cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium. The culture was rapidly chilled to 0-4 °C. Cells were collected and washed with a cold 0.85% NaCl solution and centrifuged again. The cells were rapidly suspended with vigorous stirring in 200 ml of hot (95-100 °C) 4% SDS solution for 30 min. After standing overnight at room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 200,000 × g. The pellet was washed several times and resuspended with distilled water. For production of TCT, sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) was added to the resuspended solution, which contained polymeric PGN, to a final concentration of 0.3 m. After sonification, the preparation was treated with a transglycoxylase SltY, purified in house as reported (43Engel H. Kazemier B. Keck W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6773-6782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for over 2 days at 37 °C with shaking, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.6% phosphoric acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on a Nucleosil C18 5μm reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography column (4.6 × 250 mm; Alltech, France) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-30% methanol in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 4.5). The TCT-containing fractions were desalted with a Hi-Trap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences), and the identity of TCT was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—All measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a MicroCalorimetry System (Microcal Inc.). The proteins in this study were dialyzed against a buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. TCT was dissolved in the same buffer. The samples were degassed for 20 min and centrifuged to remove any residuals prior to the measurements. Dilution enthalpies were determined in separate experiments (titrant into buffer) and subtracted from the enthalpies of the binding between the proteins and TCT. Data were analyzed using Origin software (Microcal). Sequence Alignment—Sequences of the PGRP domains of 18 different PGRPs (Fig. 4c) were aligned using the program ClustalW (44Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55761) Google Scholar). The accession numbers in the Swiss-Prot data base are as follows: D-LA (Q9VSV8), D-LB (Q9VGN3), D-LC (Q9GNK5), D-LD (Q9GN97), D-LE (Q9VXN9), D-LF (Q9VSW0), D-SA (Q9VYX7), D-SB1 (Q9VV97), D-SB2 (Q9VV96), D-SC1B (Q95SQ9), D-SC2 (Q9V4X2), D-SD (Q9VS97), H-L (Q96PD5), H-Iα (Q96LB9), H-Iβ (Q96LB8), and H-S (O75594), where “D” and “H” represent Drosophila melanogaster and human, respectively. Structure Determination and Overall Structure—The PGRP domain (residues 173-345) of Drosophila PGRP-LE (hereafter referred to as PGRP-LE) was produced in E. coli. The monomeric form of PGRP-LE could be obtained, but nondiscrete oligomeric forms were overwhelming, which eluted as a broad peak from a gel filtration column. We suspected that the affinity of PGRP-LE for PGN is quite high, such that heterogeneously sized PGN fragments were co-purifying with the protein. In retrospect, TCT binding to the protein probably caused the oligomerization of the protein (see below). Partial denaturation followed by renaturation of the protein as described under “Experimental Procedures” resulted in a dramatic increase in the monomeric form that migrated as a single band on a native gel and exhibited a typical circular dichroism spectrum for the α/β fold. Large crystals were obtained with this protein sample, but they diffracted only up to 6 Å. To obtain the crystals of the protein in complex with TCT, a 3-fold molar excess of TCT was soaked into the crystals. The TCT-soaking improved the x-ray diffraction from 6 to 2.4 Å. The crystal structure of the PGRP-LE·TCT complex was solved with molecular replacement method by using the structure of PGRP-LB (7Kim M.S. Byun M. Oh B.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) as the search model. The solvent content of the crystals was exceptionally high (78%), and the asymmetric unit contained four PGRP-LE molecules, all of which exhibited a nearly identical local environment. The structure of PGRP-LE consists of three α-helices and one central β-sheet composed of six β-strands. Clear and strong electron density for the bound TCT molecule (Fig. 1, a and b), fully occupying the entire PGN-binding cleft, was observed at an initial stage of the structure refinement. The tetrapeptide stem of TCT lies in the cleft in an extended conformation (Fig. 1c). The Cα atom of meso-DAP is the point at which its long side chain and the fourth residue, d-Ala, bifurcate to span together the shallow and wide end of the PGN binding groove. The plane of MurNAc(anh) is oriented perpendicular to the peptide stem and leans tightly against the deep binding pocket. The plane of GlcNAc is perpendicular to MurNAc(anh) and therefore is parallel with the peptide stem. The binding of TCT is unlikely to accompany a change in the polypeptide backbone conformation, because the shape of the ligand binding groove is essentially the same as that of isolated PGRP-LB (7Kim M.S. Byun M. Oh B.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Structural Basis for TCT-induced Formation of an Infinite Array of PGRP-LE Dimers—The addition of TCT caused PGRP-LE to form oligomers, whose average size increased proportionally with the concentration of TCT (Fig. 2a). Surprisingly, TCT is bound by two molecules of PGRP-LE in the crystal. Whereas one molecule of PGRP-LE (referred to as the first molecule) interacts with TCT at the binding groove as described above, another molecule (referred to as second molecule) interacts with the GlcNAc-MurNAc(anh) moieties of the ligand using one face of its α1 (Fig. 2b), which otherwise is solvent-exposed. Therefore, each PGRP-LE molecule interacts with one TCT molecule in the PGN-binding groove and with the disaccharide unit of the other TCT molecule at the interface between two protein molecules, resulting in an infinite array of the dimer in a head-to-tail fashion in the crystal (Fig. 2b). In a macroscopic view, the PGRP-LE·TCT complex forms infinitely long oligomers (Fig. 2b). At the dimer interface, the protein-TCT interactions are mediated exclusively by three residues on α1 of the second molecule, including Glu231, which makes two direct hydrogen bonds with the GlcNAc moiety (Fig. 3a). Only the disaccharide of TCT, but not the peptide stem, interacts with the second molecule of PGRP-LE, which highlights the crucial role of the sugar moieties in the dimerization of the protein. The protein-protein interactions at the dimer interface, which are hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic, are mediated by four residues on α1 of the second molecule (Ala216, Val219, Arg223, Asp224) and three residues in another part of the second molecule (Fig. 3b). Of these, the side chain of Ser232 of the first molecule is involved in a buried hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Ala216 on α1 of the second molecule. This interaction mediates a tight local packing of the two subunits, together with the nearby hydrophobic interactions shown in Fig. 3b. As such, α1 makes a predominant contribution to the interactions at the dimer interface and thus appears as if it is a clamp that holds down the disaccharide unit of TCT to"

This is generally taken as evidence for the presence of two cluster subpopulations that have different geneses. However, here we find that, because of the nonlinear nature of the metallicity-to-color transformation, a coeval group of old clusters with a unimodal metallicity spread can exhibit color bimodality. The models of cluster colors indicate that horizontal-branch stars are the main drivers behind the empirical nonlinearity. We show that the scenario gives simple and cohesive explanations for all the key observations and could simplify theories of elliptical galaxy formation."

https://openalex.org/W2157189603,"Neural crest cells (NCCs) can adopt different neuronal fates. In NCCs, neurogenin-2 promotes sensory specification but does not specify different subclasses of sensory neurons. Understanding the gene cascades that direct Trk gene activation may reveal mechanisms generating sensory diversity, because different Trks are expressed in different sensory neuron subpopulations. Here we show in chick and mouse that the Runt transcription factor Runx1 promotes axonal growth, is selectively expressed in neural crest-derived TrkA(+) sensory neurons and mediates TrkA transactivation in migratory NCCs. Inhibition of Runt activity depletes TrkA expression and leads to neuronal death. Moreover, Runx1 overexpression is incompatible with multipotency in the migratory neural crest but does not induce expression of pan-neuronal genes. Instead, Runx1-induced neuronal differentiation depends on an existing neurogenin2 proneural gene program. Our data show that Runx1 directs, in a context-dependent manner, key aspects of the establishment of the TrkA(+) nociceptive subclass of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2163382819,"Myostatin is an inhibitor of skeletal muscle growth. Disruption of the Mstn gene in mice results in muscles that weigh two to three times those of controls, but precisely how myostatin signals to exert its effects on muscle is unclear. We used the Affymetrix GeneChip system to identify differences in gene expression between myostatin null and wild-type mice. The results indicated a switch in muscle fiber type, from slow to fast, in the absence of myostatin. They also indicated that myostatin may act upstream of Wnt pathway components. Notably, it repressed expression of Wnt4. Wnt4 was capable of stimulating satellite cell proliferation, while inhibition of Wnt signaling down-regulated satellite cell proliferation. This evidence points to a role for Wnt/calcium signaling in the growth and maintenance of postnatal skeletal muscle. This study offers new insight into potential downstream targets of myostatin, which will be beneficial for elucidation of the mechanism through which myostatin acts to inhibit muscle growth."

Here we demonstrate that NEU3 mRNA level are increased in renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues, significantly correlating with elevation of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine that has been implicated in immune responses and pathogenesis of several cancers, including RCCs. In human RCC ACHN cells, IL-6 treatment enhanced NEU3 promoter luciferase activity 2.5-fold and the endogenous sialidase activity significantly. NEU3 transfection or IL-6 treatment resulted in both suppression of apoptosis and promotion of cell motility, and the combination had synergistic effects. NEU3 scarcely affected MAPK- or IL-6-induced STAT3 activation but promoted the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt cascade in both IL-6-dependent and -independent ways. Consistent with these data, NEU3 markedly inhibited staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activity and enhanced IL-6-dependent inhibition, which was abolished by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. Furthermore, IL-6 promoted Rho activation, and the effect was potentiated by NEU3, leading to increased cell motility that was again affected by LY294002. NEU3 silencing by siRNA resulted in the opposite: decreased Akt phosphorylation and inhibition of Rho activation. Gycolipid analysis showed a decrease in ganglioside GM3 and increase in lactosylceramide after NEU3 transfection, with these lipids apparently affecting cell apoptosis and motility. The results indicate that NEU3 activated by IL-6 exerts IL-6-mediated signaling, largely via the PI3K/Akt cascade, in a positive feedback manner and contributes to expression of a malignant phenotype in RCCs.

In addition, IL-6 is implicated in the pathogenesis and prognosis of several cancers and is known to be an autocrine growth factor for RCCs, in which it is highly expressed (3Miki S. Iwano M. Miki Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The level is positively correlated with tumor size and stage and thus might be one factor for a poor diagnosis (4Blay J.-Y. Negrier S. Cobaret V. Attali S. Goillot E. Merrouche Y. Mercatello A. Ravault A. Tourani J.-M. Moskovtchenko J.-F. Phillip T. Favrot M.

On IL-6 binding to its receptor, composed of two subunits (gp80 and gp130), the gp130-associated tyrosine kinases Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 become activated and phosphorylate the gp130 cytoplasmic tail on specific tyrosine residues. These phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for signal molecules, including STATs and molecules inducing activation of the Ras/MAPK and PI3K cascades (6Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T. Science. 1992; 257: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Recent observations have suggested that increased production of IL-6 in RCCs is caused partially by p53 mutations (7Angelo L.S. Talpaz M. Kurzrock M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 932-940PubMed Google Scholar). Although IL-6-induced proliferation involves the STAT3 pathway in renal cancer ACHN cells (8Horiguchi A. Oya M. Marumo K. Murai M. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 926-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the mechanism and significance of IL-6-mediated signaling in RCCs is not fully understood. Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids present in cell surface membranes, are thought to make important contributions to cell surface interactions and transmembrane signaling (9Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Their alteration is ubiquitously observed in cancers, with the appearance of tumor-associated antigens, aberrant adhesion, and blocking of normal signaling (10Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hakomori S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10231-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). To elucidate the associated molecular mechanisms we have focused on sialidase, which catalyzes the removal of sialic acids from glycoproteins and glycolipids in an initial step of degradation of these molecules (12Miyagi T. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Hata K. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In line with the aberrant expression of gangliosides in cancer, we recently demonstrated remarkable up-regulation of the plasma membrane-associated sialidase (NEU3) in human colon cancers (13Kakugawa Y.

Because of its unique character in specifically hydrolyzing gangliosides at plasma membranes (14Wada T. Yoshikawa Y. Tokuyama S. Kuwabara M. Akita H. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Monti E. Bassi M.T. Papini N. Riboni M. Manzoni M. Venerando B. Croci G. Preti A. Ballabio A. Tettamanti G. Borsani G. Biochem.

In fact, recent reports have presented evidence that NEU3 participates in neuronal differentiation (16Hasegawa T. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Takeda A. Itoyama Y. Miyagi T. J. Biol.

In the present study, we investigated NEU3 in RCC in connection with IL-6 function using tumor tissues from RCC patients and renal cancer ACHN cells. Our results demonstrate: 1) that sialidase is up-regulated in tumor tissues and is strongly linked to the IL-6 expression level; and 2) that NEU3 in ACHN cells is activated by IL-6 and acts in a positive feedback manner on the cytokine function, mainly through PI3K/Akt pathway, resulting in suppression of apoptosis and promotion of migration. Consistent with our previous observations (20Sasaki A. Hata K. Suzuki S. Sawada M. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Obinata M. Tateno H. Suzuki H. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27896-27902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), NEU3 was suggested to play a role as a signal modulator. Antibody and Reagents—Recombinant human IL-6 was purchased from PeproTech and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor), AG490 (a JAK family kinase inhibitor), and PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) from Calbiochem. Staurosporine and a protein kinase C inhibitor were from Sigma. Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-p44/42 MAPK, anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-STAT3 and anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) from Upstate Biotechnology; and anti-human IL-6 from R&D Systems. Patient Samples—Surgical specimens were obtained from 40 patients with RCCs who underwent nephrectomy at Tohoku University Hospital. Samples were taken from primary tumors and from adjacent non-tumor tissue and immediately frozen on dry ice. Informed consent was obtained from each patient to allow the use of portions of tissue for research purposes, and the study was approved by the Committee on Human Rights in Research at Tohoku University School of Medicine. Cell Culture and NEU3 Transfection—Human renal carcinoma ACHN cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. To obtain stable transfectants, we constructed an expression plasmid (pCEP-hNeu3) by inserting the entire open reading frame (1.2 kb) of the human NEU3 gene (14Wada T. Yoshikawa Y. Tokuyama S. Kuwabara M. Akita H. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) into an expression vector, pCEP4 (Invitrogen), and hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science)-resistant clones were isolated at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. The expression plasmid was transfected into ACHN cells (1×105/6-well dish) using Effectene (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. ACHN cells were also transiently transfected with NEU3 without hygromycin B and were used for some experiments after 48 h of transfection. siRNA Transfection—siRNAs targeting NEU3 and control scrambled siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon RNA Technologies, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sequence for targeting NEU3 was AAGGGAGTGTGGTAAGTTT (NEU3 siRNA) beginning at nucleotide 839 of the NEU3 open reading frame sequence, and the scrambled siRNA control was GCGATTAATGTAGGTTCGA. Transfection into ACHN cells was performed in 60-mm dishes with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 24–48 h after transfection, cells were used for experimentation. Sialidase Activity Assay—Cells were washed with PBS, sonicated on ice in 9 volumes of ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (crude extract) was then used for measurement of sialidase activity at pH 4.6 with mixed gangliosides from bovine brain (Sigma) as the substrate in the presence of Triton X-100. The released sialic acid was determined by the modified thiobarbituric acid method or by fluorometric high-performance liquid chromatography with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene as described elsewhere (21Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Takemori Y. Nakamura M. Ohkura Y. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 377: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad). One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme cleaving 1 nmol of sialic acid/h. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Human NEU3 and IL-6 mRNA levels were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (real-time PCR, Lightcycler®, Roche Diagnostics) as described previously (22Yamaguchi T. Hata K. Koseki K. Shiozaki K. Akita H. Wada T. Moriya S. Miyagi T. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from primary tumors and adjacent tissues and also from ACHN cells with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. First strand cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcription and used as templates for PCR. Human NEU3 primers were sense (5′-AGGTCAGTCTCCAGTACCTTC-3′, nucleotides 187–208 from start codon) and antisense (5′-ACATCCAGCATCCTGACTGTAG-3′, nucleotides 588–609). Human IL-6 primers were sense (5′-TACATCCTCGACGGCATCTC-3′, nucleotides 237–256 from start codon) and antisense (5′-GCTACATTTGCCGAAGAGCC-3′, nucleotides 683–702). To normalize for sample variation in ACHN cells, expression of a housekeeping isoform of human porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) was measured as an internal control as described previously (22Yamaguchi T. Hata K. Koseki K. Shiozaki K. Akita H. Wada T. Moriya S. Miyagi T. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For RCC tissue samples, human 5-aminolevilinate synthase (ALAS1) mRNA level was also measured as an internal control. Primers were sense (5′-TCCACTGCAGCAGTACACTAC-3′, nucleotides 220–241 from start codon) and antisense (5′-CCTGGAAGTTCTTCAGCAGTC-3′, nucleotides 569–590). Luciferase Reporter Assay—A cosmid clone was isolated from a human placenta genomic library in pWE15 (BD Biosciences Clontech), using a 1.2-kb cDNA probe containing the entire open reading frame of the human NEU3 gene, and employed for the construction of reporter plasmids by inserting DNA fragments containing the 5′-flanking region of the gene into the SmaI site of the promoter- and enhancer-less luciferase reporter vector, PGV-B (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Reporter plasmids containing 1.5- and 0.5-kb fragments upstream of the apparent transcription initiation site were designed and used for transfection of ACHN cells seeded on 6-well plates. At 24 h after transfection, IL-6 was added followed by further culture for 24 h, and luciferase activity was assayed using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). IL-6 Measurement by ELISA—To determine the amount of IL-6 protein produced by ACHN, ELISA was performed. Cells were plated at 1×105/60-mm dish, and after 24 h cell culture supernatants were harvested, centrifuged, and stored at –20 °C. Quantikine®, a human-specific IL-6 ELISA (R&D Systems), was used for determination of the amount of IL-6 present under conditions of absorbance at 450 nm, with correction at 570 nm using a microplate reader. Western Blotting—Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). After extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, cell lysates containing equal amounts of proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with TBS-Tween containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with primary antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected by using the appropriate peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies with ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) and the Versa Doc imaging system (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analyses were performed with Quantity One quantitation software (Bio-Rad). Rho Activity Assay—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in Mg2+-containing lysis buffer (MLB: 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1%Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and equal volumes were incubated with 20 μg of rhotekin RBD (Rho-binding domain)-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) for 45 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The agarose beads were then washed with MLB and resuspended in Laemmli reducing sample buffer. Bound Rho proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-Rho rabbit IgG fraction antibodies (Sigma). Cell Motility Assays—Chemokinesis assays (undirected migration) were performed by an established method with some modification (23Nakamura T. Kanda S. Yamamoto K. Kohno T. Maeda K. Matsuyama T. Kanetake H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7610-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were suspended in serum-free medium supplemented with inhibitors and/or IL-6 and seeded on the upper surface membranes of cell culture inserts (Falcon). Lower chambers were filled with the same medium, and after 24 h cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa solution. After wiping the upper surface of the stained membranes with a cotton swab to remove non-migrating cells, all cells present on the lower surface of the membranes were counted under a microscope. Apoptosis Assays—Apoptosis analysis was performed by annexin V staining (Annexin-V Fluos staining kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In brief, at 24 h after seeding into 60-mm dishes in 10% fetal bovine serum containing minimal essential medium, cells were treated with staurosporine in the presence or absence of IL-6 in serum-free medium for the appropriate periods. The cells were then double-stained with annexin V followed by propidium iodide for 10 min, and apoptotic cells were analyzed by FACScan (BD Biosciences). Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)—Glycolipids were extracted from cells (1 × 107) in sequence with 2 ml of isopropanol/hexane/water (55:25: 20, v/v/v) and hydrolyzed with 0.1 m NaOH/methanol. After desalting with a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, total lipid extracts were applied to DEAE-Sephadex A-25 minicolumns. Neutral glycolipids were eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8, v/v/v) and acidic glycolipids with chloroform/methanol/2 m AcONa (30:60:8, v/v/v). After dialysis, equal amounts of each sample were applied to high-performance TLC plates (Baker). Neutral glycolipids were separated by chromatography in a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/0.02% aqueous CaCl2 (60:40:9, v/v/v), and acidic glycolipids in chloroform/methanol/0.02% aqueous CaCl2 (60:35:8, v/v/v). All glycolipids were visualized with orcinol-H2SO4. Densitometric analyses were performed with Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Increased Expression of NEU3 in Primary Human RCCs and Its Activation by IL-6 in ACHN Cells—RCC tumors were found to possess higher NEU3 mRNA levels than adjacent normal tissues by a mean 5.6-fold, as shown in Fig. 1A. IL-6 mRNA levels in the same samples were found to be similarly increased by a mean 6.3-fold (Fig. 1B). The increase in these genes was significantly correlated (correlation coefficient, r = 0.5437, p = 0.002). When NEU3 mRNA and sialidase activity were assessed in ACHN cells and its NEU3 stable transfectants, IL-6 treatment significantly increased endogenous NEU3 activity by 1.2–1.6-fold and the mRNA level by 1.2–2.5-fold in the control case (Fig. 2A). Even in the stably NEU3-transfected ACHN cells, a 1.2–1.8-fold increase was observed in the activity (137 ± 5 as compared with 95 ± 4 units/mg protein for the cells without IL-6). Considering a possible effect of increased NEU3 on IL-6 production in ACHN, basal IL-6 level in the conditioned medium was determined using ELISA. The IL-6 secretion level was, however, not different between NEU3 and mock transfectants (data not shown). To determine whether the NEU3 gene transcription is activated by IL-6, we transiently transfected the NEU3 promoter luciferase vector into ACHN cells. Different lengths of the 5′-upstream region were prepared by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted. After 24 h of IL-6 treatment, both 1.5- and 0.5-kb fragments exhibited higher luciferase activity by a maximal 2.5-fold as compared with nontreated cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that a IL-6-driven transcriptional factor binds to the NEU3 promoter and that NEU3 expression is transactivated by IL-6, even if not remarkably so. We could not find a typical STAT3 binding element, but five atypical Sp1 binding elements were located in the promoter region of NEU3 gene. Therefore there is still a possibility that the latter may be involved in IL-6-induced transactivation in cooperation with STAT3 (24Loeffler S. Fayard B. Weis J. Weissenberger J. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 115: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Increased expression of NEU3 and gene transactivation with IL-6 treatment in ACHN cells. Cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium and stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL-6 for an additional 24 h. A, increased ganglioside sialidase activity in ACHN parent cells (a) and NEU3-transfected cells (b) after IL-6 treatment, along with increased endogenous NEU3mRNA levels in ACHN parent cells (c). B, increased transactivation of the NEU3 gene by IL-6. NEU3 promoter luciferase vector was transiently transfected into ACHN cells, and 24 h after IL-6 treatment, luciferase activity was measured and compared with the level in untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Suppression of Apoptosis and Promotion of Cell Motility by NEU3 Overexpression and Potentiation of IL-6 Effects—To elucidate the significance of increased NEU3 expression in connection with IL-6, our observations on malignant phenotype were performed using two independent clones of NEU3 stable transfectants having a 15–25-fold increase in ganglioside sialidase activity over the control cells. Staurosporine-induced apoptosis was remarkably inhibited in the NEU3 transfectants as compared with that in mock transfectants, and this inhibition was further enhanced after the addition of exogenous IL-6, as assessed by annexin V and propidium iodide staining (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained for serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, although less markedly (data not shown). We also found an alteration of cell motility of ACHN cells by NEU3 overexpression and IL-6 treatment (Fig. 3B). The motility of mock transfectants with IL-6 treatment was increased about 2-fold. Moreover, the motility of NEU3-transfected cells was significantly higher than for mock-transfected cells either in the presence or absence of IL-6. Analyses of the Molecules Involved in IL-6 Signaling—To cast light on the mechanism of how NEU3 overexpression suppresses apoptosis and enhances motility, molecular changes in IL-6 signaling were studied in ACHN cells. First, the effects of NEU3 overexpression and IL-6 treatment on activation of STAT3, ERK, and Akt in JAK/STAT3, ERK, PI3K pathways, respectively, were examined using phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 4). Total ERK proteins were comparably expressed in mock and NEU3 transfectants, but the phosphorylation levels were not affected by IL-6 or NEU3 (Fig. 4A). ERKs were constitutively activated in ACHN cells, as reported previously (8Horiguchi A. Oya M. Marumo K. Murai M. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 926-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and NEU3 transfection was not further up-regulated by stimulation with exogenous IL-6. In addition, neutralization of IL-6 using an antibody did not reduce the activation level, indicating that endogenous IL-6 produced by the cells was not responsible for the constitutive activation of ERKs (data not shown). Using a phospho-specific antibody (STAT3 at Tyr705), activation of STAT3 by IL-6 could be shown to similar extents in both mock and NEU3 transfectants, under conditions where STAT3 protein expression levels were not affected (Fig. 4B). In contrast, activation of Akt (at Ser473) was induced by IL-6 in parental ACHN and mock transfectants but was more strongly activated in NEU3 transfectants. The activation was further enhanced by IL-6 when total Akt protein was at similar levels in mock and NEU3 transfectants. Thus, PI3K activation might be responsible for the suppression of apoptosis and increased motility caused by NEU3 overexpression and by IL-6 treatment. To confirm this possibility, we examined activation of caspase-3 downstream of Akt (Fig. 5). Cleaved caspase-3 was detected in cells treated with 50 nm staurosporine in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml IL-6 in serum-free medium. The level was decreased in both mock and NEU3 transfectants with IL-6, although NEU3 transfection itself caused a marked decrease (Fig. 5A). When NEU3 transfectants were treated with LY294002 or with PD98059 or AG490 and staurosporine in the presence or absence of IL-6, the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, was most effective at increasing caspase-3 cleavage, irrespective of whether IL-6 was present (Fig. 5B). Rho was also activated by stimulation with IL-6 in parental ACHN and mock-transfected cells, being already highly activated in NEU3 transfectants and enhanced further by addition of IL-6 (Fig. 6A). Inhibitory effects with LY294002 were again most evident both with and without IL-6 (Fig. 6B). Similar results were obtained in other clones of NEU3 stable transfectants and also in the transient transfectants (data not shown), although the effects were not in proportion to NEU3 expression level, probably because the level was already high enough to show the effects. To confirm further whether NEU3 directly affects these phenomena, we employed siRNA-mediated silencing of NEU3 gene. The siRNA targeting NEU3 reduced mRNA level by 60% and the scrambled control showed no significant change of level, as estimated by real-time reverse transcription-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the internal control (Fig. 7A). The levels of Akt phosphorylation and Rho activity were evaluated in the cells at 48 h after transfection (Fig. 7, B and C). The results were entirely opposite of those obtained by NEU3 overexpression, as expected. Transfection with NEU3 siRNA reduced Akt and Rho activation in both IL-6-dependent and -independent ways in comparison with the scrambled control. In the presence of IL-6, NEU3 siRNA lowered especially the Akt phosphorylation level to such an extent that IL-6-dependent activation with the control was almost cancelled. These data, taken together, indicate a definite role of NEU3 in Akt and Rho activation in IL-6-dependent and -independent ways.FIGURE 6Increased Rho activation by NEU3 transfection and IL-6 treatment and the effects of inhibitors on cell motility. A, increased Rho activation by NEU3 and IL-6. Rho activity was examined by measuring GTP-Rho binding of glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin in a pull-down assay. Representative photomicrographs are shown, and quantitative data for Rho activity are presented as values relative to that observed in the ACHN parent cells without IL-6. B, effective reduction of cell motility by the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. NEU3 transfectants were treated with 25 μm LY294002, 25 μm PD98059, or 25 μm AG490 in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml IL-6 for 24 h, and the motility was examined as described in the legend for Fig. 3. p values were calculated by Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7Decreased Akt phosphorylation and Rho activity by siRNA-mediated silencing of NEU3 gene with and without IL-6. A, reduction of NEU3 mRNA level by transfection with NEU3 siRNA into ACHN cells but no changes with the scrambled control (S.C.). B and C, decreased Akt phosphorylation (B) and Rho activity (C) by NEU3 siRNA introduction. After 24 h of siRNA introduction, the cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free medium and stimulated or unstimulated with 20 ng/ml IL-6 for 15 min. Akt phosphorylation levels and GTP-Rho amounts were measured by Western blotting and by pull-down assay, respectively. Quantitative data are presented as values relative to those in ACHN parent cells treated with the scrambled control in the absence of IL-6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alteration of Gangliosides by NEU3 Overexpression and IL-6 Treatment—Because it is considered that glycolipid changes due to the catalytic action of NEU3 contribute to NEU3-induced effects, the ganglioside pattern was compared between the mock- and NEU3-transfected cells by TLC, with and without IL-6 treatment (Fig. 8A). Of the neutral gycolipids, lactosylceramide (Lac-Cer) was increased by NEU3 overexpression and/or IL-6 treatment, and GM3 reduction was detected in the ganglioside fraction by NEU3 or IL-6, although NEU3 overexpression alone brought about almost complete loss of GM3. When these altered glycolipids were added exogenously to the cell culture, GM3 showed decreased cell motility, whereas Lac-Cer exerted the opposite effect although to a lesser extent (Fig. 8B). In this study we found that NEU3 is highly expressed in RCCs, demonstrating significant correlation with IL-6 expression, and that this sialidase in ACHN cells is up-regulated by IL-6. Furthermore NEU3 sensitizes IL-6 signaling mainly via the PI3K pathway in a positive feedback manner, leading to suppression of apoptosis accompanied by enhanced cell migration. Although the promoter region of the NEU3 gene does not appear to contain a typical STAT3 binding element, so that the mechanism of transactivation of the NEU3 gene by IL-6 in ACHN cells remains to be clarified, it is possible that the presence of the Sp1 binding element in the promoter region may be responsible for the transactivation, because interaction between STAT3 and Sp1 can drive IL-6-mediated transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene with a STAT3 binding element-free promoter (24Loeffler S. Fayard B. Weis J. Weissenberger J. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 115: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). ERK was constitutively activated in both mock- and NEU3-transfected ACHN cells, but NEU3 overexpression caused activation of Akt and Rho without IL-6 and further potentiated activation of these molecules after IL-6 treatment, indicating a contribution of NEU3 to the IL-6-induced effects. Although the latter potentiation by NEU3 was modest, siRNA-mediated silencing of the NEU3 gene significantly decreased Akt and Rho activation in both IL-6-dependent and -independent ways. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, in contrast to the stimulating effects by NEU3 overexpression, NEU3 silencing showed significant reduction in activation of Akt and Rho in IL-6-dependent and -independent ways. This strongly suggests a crucial role of NEU3 in IL-6 signaling in RCC. Although it is considered that IL-6 signaling is regulated mainly via JAK/STAT, ERK, and PI3K/Akt pathways, and the binding of IL-6 to the receptor induces activation of JAK resulting in activation of the downstream cascades, STAT3, ERK, and PI3K. The latter two have been suggested to be activated by Ras (25Hsu J.H. Shi Y. Yan H. Hoang B. Sharma S. Gera J. Lichtenstein A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The results with inhibitors of these cascades (Figs. 5 and 6) revealed that NEU3 stimulates IL-6 induced Akt and Rho activation to a significant extent and consequently inhibits caspase-3 and promotes cell motility. Because it is known that PI3K stimulates Rho via guanidine nucleotide exchange factors (26Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in addition to activating Akt, these results indicate that NEU3 participates in regulation of the PI3K pathway, probably via a path not involving JAK. NEU3 thus may contribute to regulation of the PI3K cascade in two different ways, dependent on and independently of IL-6, which may be linked to signaling through growth factors including epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) via Ras activation, because these growth factors stimulate the growth of RCC cells in an autocrine manner (27Atlas I. Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. Fair W.R. Masui H. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3335-3339PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6-dependent stimulation by NEU3 is possibly due to in part to the cooperation of IL-6 with receptors for these growth factors, leading to synergistic cellular responses mediated by gp130, as evidenced by previous reports (28Badanche A. Hynes N.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 383-391PubMed Google Scholar, 29Qiu Y. Ravi L. Kung H.J. Nature. 1998; 393: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is also supported by the observation that GM3 depletion by NEU3 overexpression activates epidermal growth factor receptor signaling (30Wang X.O. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48770-48778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Wang X.O. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40410-40419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Considering the molecular mechanisms, it is feasible that glycolipid changes due to catalytic functions of NEU3 might contribute to activation of signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 8, the finding that the cell motility was altered by the treatment with GM3 or Lac-Cer supports this possibility. In addition, NEU3 might act as a protein molecule, interacting with signaling molecules and consequently exerting stimulatory effects. We previously demonstrated findings that NEU3 interacts with caveolin-1 in caveolae in HeLa cells (32Wang Y. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Hata K. Zhao X. Fujimoto T. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26252-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and that sialidase also attenuates insulin receptor phosphorylation and consequent post-receptor signaling by association with Grb-2 as well as by changing ganglioside components as a result of enzyme reactions in NEU3 transgenic mice (20Sasaki A. Hata K. Suzuki S. Sawada M. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Obinata M. Tateno H. Suzuki H. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27896-27902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although it is uncertain at present whether NEU3 can interact with IL-6 receptors at plasma membranes, the results clearly suggest that glycolipid changes produced by NEU3 are likely to participate in activation of the PI3K cascade, ultimately leading to inhibition of apoptosis and promotion of motility. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study indicate that NEU3 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of RCCs in cooperation with IL-6. Suppression of NEU3 expression could thus be a new and effective therapeutic approach for this tumor type."
https://openalex.org/W1995306997,"RhoA signaling plays a critical role in many cellular processes, including cell migration. Here we show that the vaccinia F11L protein interacts directly with RhoA, inhibiting its signaling by blocking the interaction with its downstream effectors Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and mDia. RNA interference–mediated depletion of F11L during infection resulted in an absence of vaccinia-induced cell motility and inhibition of viral morphogenesis. Disruption of the RhoA binding site in F11L, which resembles that of ROCK, led to an identical phenotype. Thus, inhibition of RhoA signaling is required for both vaccinia morphogenesis and virus-induced cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2094802325,"Magnetotactic bacteria contain membrane-bound intracellular iron crystals (magnetosomes) and respond to magnetic fields. Polar magnetotactic bacteria in vertical chemical gradients are thought to respond to high oxygen levels by swimming downward into areas with low or no oxygen (toward geomagnetic north in the Northern Hemisphere and geomagnetic south in the Southern Hemisphere). We identified populations of polar magnetotactic bacteria in the Northern Hemisphere that respond to high oxygen levels by swimming toward geomagnetic south, the opposite of all previously reported magnetotactic behavior. The percentage of magnetotactic bacteria with south polarity in the environment is positively correlated with higher redox potential. The coexistence of magnetotactic bacteria with opposing polarities in the same redox environment conflicts with current models of the adaptive value of magnetotaxis."

Spectral lines of compounds embedded in this host are unusually narrow, and several species have been reported to rotate in p -H 2 . We found that a p -H 2 matrix inhibits rotation of isolated methanol (CH 3 OH) but still allows internal rotation about the C–O bond, with splittings of the E/A torsional doublet in internal rotation–coupled vibrational modes that are qualitatively consistent with those for CH 3 OH in the gaseous phase. This simplified high-resolution spectrum further revealed the slow conversion of nuclear spin symmetry from species E to species A in the host matrix, offering potential insight into nuclear spin conversion in astrophysical sources."
https://openalex.org/W2141705346,"The Vpr protein of HIV-1 functions as a vital accessory gene by regulating various cellular functions, including cell differentiation, apoptosis, nuclear factor of κB (NF-κB) suppression and cell-cycle arrest of the host cell. Several reports have indicated that Vpr complexes with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), but it remains unclear whether the GR pathway is required for Vpr to function1. Here, we report that Vpr uses the GR pathway as a recruitment vehicle for the NF-κB co-activating protein, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). The GR interaction with Vpr is both necessary and sufficient to facilitate this interaction by potentiating the formation of a Vpr–GR–PARP-1 complex. The recruitment of PARP-1 by the Vpr–GR complex prevents its nuclear localization, which is necessary for Vpr to suppress NF-κB. The association of GR with PARP-1 is not observed with steroid (glucocorticoid) treatment, indicating that the GR association with PARP-1 is a gain of function that is solely attributed to HIV-1 Vpr. These data provide important insights into Vpr biology and its role in HIV pathogenesis."

In response to TOP1-mediated DNA damage induced by camptothecin, multiple SUMO1 molecules are conjugated to the N-terminal domain of a single TOP1 molecule. To investigate the molecular mechanism of SUMO1 conjugation to TOP1, an in vitro system using purified SAE1/2, Ubc9, SUMO1, and TOP1 peptides was developed. Consistent with results from in vivo studies, multiple SUMO1 molecules were found to be conjugated to the N-terminal domain of a single TOP1 molecule. Systematic analysis has identified a single major SUMO1 conjugation site located between amino acid residues 110 and 125 that contains a single lysine residue at 117 (Lys-117). Using a short peptide spanning this region, we showed that a poly-SUMO1 chain was assembled in this peptide at Lys-117. Interestingly, a Ubc9-poly-SUMO1 intermediate had accumulated to a high level when the sumoylation assay was performed in the absence of hTOP1 substrate, suggesting a possibility that the poly-SUMO1 chain is formed on Ubc9 first and then transferred en bloc onto hTOP1. This is the first definitive demonstration of the assembly of a poly-SUMO1 chain on protein substrate. These results offer new insight into hTOP1 polysumoylation in response to TOP1-mediated DNA damage and may have general implications in protein polysumoylation. Human (h) DNA topoisomerase I has been identified as a major SUMO1 target in camptothecin-treated cells.

Human SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier) (also named UBL1, PIC1, GMP1, SMT3C, and sentrin in the literature) is a ubiquitin-like protein (1Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G.

Recently, proteases that specifically activate SUMO1/Smt3p precursors and cleave SUMO1/Smt3p from their protein conjugates have been identified in yeast and mammalian cells (15Amerik A.Y. Li S.J.

Nature. 2005; 436: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), which have diverse functions, have been shown to interact with Ubc9/SUMO1 or be covalently modified by SUMO1. SUMO1 appears to primarily target nuclear proteins (23Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Although the function of SUMO1 is still elusive, there are a few interesting observations that may shed light on the function of SUMO1. First, Pods (promyelocytic leukemia protein oncogenic domains, also called nuclear bodies or ND10) (27Negorev D. Maul G.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7234-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and the nuclear envelope appear to be the major site of localization of SUMO1 conjugates in the nucleus (28Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Second, SUMO1 and ubiquitin appear to share the same conjugation site(s) on some target proteins (e.g. IκBα and MDM2) (21Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Third, stress-caused protein unfolding (e.g. heat shock) triggers SUMO (SUMO1 and SUMO2/3) conjugation to nuclear proteins, suggesting the possibility that SUMO proteins are involved in a novel protein stress response (29Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 30Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin can be assembled into polymers with different lengths and linkages, which provides an extremely versatile means of cellular regulation (25Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G.

Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Because both mono- and polyubiquitination of proteins have been observed, this prompts us to speculate that sumoylation with different lengths and linkages of SUMO1 polymer may also provide various means of cellular regulation similar to ubiquitination. In the process of SUMO modification, SUMO2 and SUMO3 have been shown to possess the ability to form polymeric chains on lysine residue 11 (38Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), whereas the existence of polysumoylation of SUMO1 has been debated. However, Pichler et al. (39Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) reported that at least four poly-SUMO1 chains were formed on RanBP2. This study thus makes an effort to establish an in vitro system for studying SUMO1 conjugation, and to examine whether SUMO1 can be conjugated to protein substrates in vitro in a form of polymeric chain. Human TOP1 has been shown to be a major SUMO1 target in cells treated with the TOP1-specific poison camptothecin (CPT) (29Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 40Horie K. Tomida A. Sugimoto Y. Yasugi T. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7913-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Multiple SUMO1 molecules are conjugated to a single molecule of human TOP1 in cells treated with CPT (29Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast have shown that inactivation of Ubc9 and overexpression of Smt3p lead to increased and decreased CPT sensitivity, respectively, suggesting the potential involvement of SUMO1 in the repair of TOP1 cleavage complexes (29Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Systematic mutational analysis of the SUMO consensus sequences on human TOP1 has identified Lys-117 at the N-terminal domain to be the major site for sumoylation (41Rallabhandi P. Hashimoto K. Mo Y.Y. Beck W.T. Moitra P.K. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40020-40026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether multiple SUMO1 molecules are conjugated to Lys-117. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of SUMO1 conjugation to human TOP1 in vitro using purified protein components. Our results suggest that a poly-SUMO1 chain is formed at Lys-117 of human TOP1. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The insect cell line Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 was cultured at 27 °C in Hanks' medium supplemented with antibiotics and 5% fetal calf serum for the expression of SAE1/SAE2 and full-length human topoisomerase I. Hanks' medium was prepared from Grace's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.33% tissue culture yeastolate (Sigma), 0.33% tissue culture lactalbumin hydrolysate (Sigma). Construction of Protein Expression Plasmids and Recombinant Baculovirus—DNA encoding for SUMO1-(1-97) was prepared by PCR using full-length SUMO1 cDNA as a template. To subclone SUMO1 cDNA into Escherichia coli expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) in the right reading frame immediately after the His tag codon, we designed primers to carry the BamHI restriction site at the 5′-end and EcoRI restriction site at the 3′-end immediately after the stop codon of the SUMO1 cDNA. The PCR-amplified SUMO1 cDNA fragment was then digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into pQE30 that was precut with BamHI and EcoRI. The resulting plasmid was designated pQE30-SUMO1-(1-97). The methodology used for constructing the plasmid expressing hUbc9 was similar to that used for constructing the SUMO1 expressing plasmid described above. The GeneTailor mutagenesis kit was applied to construct the plasmid for the expression of the SUMO1 mutant with all lysines changed into arginines at amino residues 7, 16, 17, 23, 25, 37, 39, 45, 46, 48, and 78 according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was designated pQE30-SUMO1-(1-97)(Lys-Arg). GST-hTOP1 fusion proteins containing various human topoisomerase I (hTOP1) fragments, GST-hTOP1-(110-125), GST-hTOP1-(1-200), GST-hTOP1-(201-400), GST-hTOP1-(401-600), and GST-hTOP1-(601-765), were prepared as described previously (42Chen T.Y. Hsu C.T. Chang K.H. Ting C.Y. Whang-Peng J. Hui C.F. Hwang J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 53: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All restriction enzymes for subcloning were purchased from MBI Fermentas. Recombinant baculoviruses for the expression of full-length hTOP1 and SAE1/His6-SAE2 were constructed as follows. cDNAs encoding full-length hTOP1, SAE1, and SAE2 were subcloned into the baculoviral expression vector pFastBac HTa and pFastBac HTc. The bacmid constructs were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system protocol (Invitrogen). Cellfectin-mediated transfection of bacmid into Sf21 cells in 35-mm plates was applied to produce infectious recombinant baculovirus. The amplified recombinant baculovirus was then used to infect Sf21 cells in 140-mm plates for 7 days, and the supernatant was collected as a high titer viral stock. Protein Expression and Purification—To express the recombinant proteins of His6-hUbc9, His6-SUMO1-(1-97), and His6-SUMO1-(1-97)(Lys-Arg), plasmids pQE30-hUbc9, pQE30-SUMO1-(1-97), and pQE30-SUMO1-(1-97)(Lys-Arg) were individually transformed into the E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen). The resulting transformants were cultured in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) with constant shaking (200 cycles/min) at 37 °C. When A600 nm reached 0.3, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm, and the culture was grown for an additional 3 h at 37°C. The cells were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 20 min, and then resuspended in a binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.9, and 100 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After sonication, lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were loaded onto Ni-NTA columns (Qiagen). Columns were then washed with binding buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and eluted with binding buffer containing 100 mm imidazole and 10% glycerol. Eluted fractions were pooled and concentrated. The purity of the protein was determined by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. The purified proteins were stored at -70 °C until use. The recombinant GST fusion proteins, GST-hTOP1-(110-125), GST-hTOP1-(1-200), GST-hTOP1-(201-400), GST-hTOP1-(401-600), and GST-hTOP1-(601-765), were expressed and purified as described (42Chen T.Y. Hsu C.T. Chang K.H. Ting C.Y. Whang-Peng J. Hui C.F. Hwang J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 53: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To express and purify the recombinant SAE1/SAE2 heterodimer, 1 ml of SAE1/baculoviral stock and 1 ml of His6-SAE2/baculoviral stock were used to infect 2 × 107 Sf21 insect cells per 140-mm plate. Infected cells were cultured at 27 °C for 3 days. Cells were collected and suspended in 4 volumes of a lysis solution containing of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. After incubation on ice for 20 min, lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and loaded onto the Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). After the column was washed with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) containing 200 mm NaCl, SAE1/His6-SAE2 was eluted with binding buffer containing 400 mm NaCl. The SAE1/His6-SAE2-containing fractions were collected and then loaded onto the Ni-NTA column, followed by successive washings with the binding buffer containing 5 mm imidazole. The column was then eluted with the binding buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The SAE1/His6-SAE2 heterodimer containing fractions were pooled and stored at -70 °C. [35S]Methionine-labeled full-length hTOP1 was prepared by infecting 2 × 107 Sf21 cells with 1 ml of hTOP1-baculovirus stock in methionine-free Grace's medium containing 1 mCi of [35S]methionine. Cells were harvested 16 h post-labeling of [35S]methionine. [35S]Methioninelabeled hTOP1 was then purified as briefly described below. Infected cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40, 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 20% PEG8000. After incubation on ice for 20 min, the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected, and labeled hTOP1 was purified using the Ni-NTA column. The [35S]methionine-labeled hTOP1 was eluted from the column with 100 mm imidazole. The fractions of [35S]methionine-labeled hTOP1 were pooled and further purified on a Q-Sepharose column. After this two-step purification, the purity of [35S]methionine-labeled hTOP1 reached 95%. Antibodies and Immunoblotting Analysis—Mouse anti-His tag antibodies and goat anti-GST antibodies were purchased from Serotec and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Anti-SUMO1, anti-hUbc9, and anti-SAE1/SAE2 antibodies were purchased from LAE Biotech. Co., Ltd. All the secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega. To detect SUMO1-conjugated proteins, the in vitro sumoylation reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies as detailed in figure legends. Detection of SUMO1-conjugated proteins was achieved using either an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) or an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by staining with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium FAST substrate (Sigma). In Vitro Sumoylation Assay—In vitro sumoylation assay was performed using purified recombinant proteins. The reaction mixture (20 μl each) contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 μg of hUbc9, 1 μg of SUMO-1, 150 ng of SAE1/His6-SAE2, and 0.6 μg of substrate protein. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. The reaction mixture was then heat-denatured with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed on SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. All experiments were repeated at least twice, and the same results were obtained. Isopeptidase Cleavage and Thrombin Cleavage—To remove the GST tag from GST fusion proteins, thrombin cleavage was performed at room temperature with 1 unit of thrombin (Sigma) in thrombin cleavage buffer (2.5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h. The isopeptidase Ulp1 (Ubl-specific protease 1) (Invitrogen) was also used to cleave SUMO1 from sumoylated substrates. The isopeptidase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 1 h in isoprotease reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Igepal, 1 mm DTT, and 100 mm NaCl). At the end of the reaction, samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies. Plasmid DNA Relaxation Assay—The relaxation activity of hTOP1 was measured using supercoiled plasmid DNA pGEM-5Z. Briefly, each reaction mixture had a total volume of 20 ml containing 0.2 μg of supercoiled DNA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and various amounts of SUMO1-modified or unmodified hTOP1. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min, terminated by adding 1% SDS, and then separated on a 0.8% agarose gel. Topoisomerase I-mediated Cleavage Assay—The reaction mixtures (20 μl each) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10,000 cpm of 3′-end-labeled pGEM-5Z DNA, 0.1 μg of sumoylated or unsumoylated hTOP1, and various concentrations of camptothecin were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 μl of 5% SDS and 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 1 h. Following the addition of loading buffer, DNA samples were separated on a 8% polyacrylamide gel with TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried onto Whatman No. 3MM chromatographic paper and autoradiographed at -80 °C using Kodak XAR-5 films. Sumoylation of hTOP1 in Vitro—To establish an in vitro sumoylation system for hTOP1, the essential components of the sumoylation reaction, recombinant SAE1/His6-SAE2, His6-hUbc9, and His6-SUMO1-(1-97), were purified. As shown in Fig. 1A, the purity of these sumoylation reaction components reached more than 95% homogeneity. When purified [35S]methionine-labeled hTOP1 was incubated with SAE1/His6-SAE2, His6-hUbc9, and His6-SUMO1-(1-97), multiple species of hTOP1, which migrated slower than hTOP1, were revealed (Fig. 1B). The intensities of these high molecular weight species of hTOP1 were proportionally increased with increasing concentrations of SAE1/His6-SAE2 in the reactions. We also performed a similar sumoylation reaction using unlabeled hTOP1. The high molecular weight species of hTOP1 were confirmed to be SUMO1-conjugated hTOP1 with anti-hTOP1 and anti-SUMO1 antibodies (data not shown). These results indicate that the in vitro system is robust for the formation of hTOP1-SUMO1 conjugates. The N-terminal Domain of Human Topoisomerase I Is Extensively Modified by SUMO1 in Vitro—To determine the sumoylation site(s) on hTOP1, four different GST-fused proteins containing various hTOP1 fragments, GST-hTOP1-(1-200), GST-hTOP1-(201-400), GST-hTOP1-(401-600), and GST-hTOP1-(601-765), were used in the in vitro sumoylation reaction. GST is unlikely to contribute to the formation of SUMO1 conjugates for the GST-TOP1 fusion proteins because GST is not a SUMO1 substrate (data not shown). Although the SUMOplot™ software shows that hTOP1-(1-200), hTOP1-(201-400), hTOP1-(401-600), and hTOP1-(601-765) carry 5, 3, 1, and 3 sumoylation motifs, respectively, the results of our in vitro sumoylation reactions showed that the extent of sumoylation was not correlated with the number of sumoylation motifs among these GST-TOP1 fusion proteins. Most intriguingly, only GST-hTOP1-(1-200) formed extensive SUMO1 conjugates, whereas GST-hTOP1-(201-400), GST-hTOP1-(401-600), and GST-hTOP1-(601-765) were only weakly sumoylated (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the major sumoylation site(s) of hTOP1 reside in the N-terminal amino acid residues 1-200 of hTOP1. Notably, the number of SUMO1-modified species of GST-hTOP1-(1-200) is much more than the number of sumoylation motifs predicted by the SUMOplot™ software, suggesting the possibility of assembly of a polymeric SUMO1 chain(s) on hTOP1-(1-200). Formation of a Polymeric Chain(s) of SUMO1 in Vitro—The formation of polymeric SUMO2/SUMO3 chains during sumoylation has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (38Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Unlike SUMO2/SUMO3, SUMO1 has been proposed to undergo mono-SUMO1 conjugation to target proteins because of its lack of an internal SUMO consensus motif. However, this study has suggested the possibility that a poly-SUMO1 chain(s) is formed on hTOP1-(1-200). To rigorously test this possibility, we constructed a GST/hTOP1-(110-125) fusion protein, designated GST-hTOP1-(110-125), in which the 16-amino acid peptide derived from amino acids 110 to 125 of hTOP1 was fused to GST. This peptide was chosen because it contains a single SUMO motif with the highest modification probability in the N-terminal domain (1-200 amino acids) of hTOP1 (41Rallabhandi P. Hashimoto K. Mo Y.Y. Beck W.T. Moitra P.K. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40020-40026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As a negative control, the lysine residue (Lys-117) of the SUMO motif in this fusion protein was replaced with arginine to create the mutant protein, designated GST-hTOP1-(110-125)(K117R). The results revealed that with increasing concentrations of SAE1/His6-SAE2, at least three slower migrating species, corresponding to monomer, dimer, and trimer of SUMO1 conjugated to GST-hTOP1-(110-125) were observed (Fig. 3A). As expected, no SUMO1 modification species was detected when GST-hTOP1-(110-125)(K117R) was used as the substrate (Fig. 3B). Because Lys-117 is predicted to be the only SUMO1 conjugation site on GST-hTOP1-(110-125) and is the only lysine residue in hTOP1-(110-125), the formation of multiple species of GST-hTOP1-(110-125)-SUMO1 conjugates suggests that SUMO1 may form a polymeric chain(s) on hTOP1-(110-125) at Lys-117. Because the chemical nature of the polymeric chain of SUMO1 is expected to be similar to that of SUMO2/SUMO3, the polymeric chain of SUMO1 is likely to result from the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine residue of SUMO1 and the ϵ-amino group of an internal lysine residue of the adjacent SUMO1. Thus, if all the internal lysine residues of SUMO1 were replaced with arginine residues, the mutated SUMO1 (lysineless SUMO1), designated as SUMO1-(1-97)(Lys-Arg), should not be able to form a polymeric SUMO1 chain(s). As shown in Fig. 3C, wild type SUMO1 formed at least two discernible SUMO1-conjugated species consistent with polysumoylation of the substrate. By contrast, only a single SUMO1-conjugated GST-hTOP1-(110-125) species was detected when SUMO1-(1-97)(Lys-Arg) was used in the sumoylation reaction. These results suggest that wild type SUMO1 can undergo polysumoylation, whereas mutant SUMO1-(1-97)(Lys-Arg) can only undergo monosumoylation on GST-hTOP1-(110-125). These results therefore provide additional support for the existence of a polymeric SUMO1 chain(s) on hTOP1-(110-125) and suggest the involvement of a lysine residue on SUMO1 in the formation of the polymeric chain. To further confirm that SUMO1 is conjugated to GST-hTOP1-(110-125) in the form of a polymeric SUMO1 chain, GST-hTOP1-(110-125)-SUMO1 conjugates were processed by sequential thrombin digestion and SUMO isopeptidase Ulp1 cleavage. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, thrombin can cleave GST-hTOP1-(110-125) at the cleavage sequence LVPRGS, which resides in between the GST module and hTOP1-(110-125). If a SUMO1 polymeric chain was formed on Lys-117 of hTOP1-(110-125), we would expect to see the polymeric form of SUMO1 conjugated to hTOP1-(110-125) peptide. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4B, the hTOP1-(110-125) species that corresponded to hTOP1-(110-125) conjugated to monomeric, dimeric, and even trimeric forms of SUMO1 were produced from GST-hTOP1-(110-125)-SUMO1 conjugates upon thrombin digestion. The levels of hTOP1-(110-125)-mono-SUMO1 (Fig. 4B, labeled hTOP1-(110-125)+ 1*SUMO1) and hTOP1-(110-125)-di-SUMO1 (Fig. 4B, labeled hTOP1-(110-125)+ 2*SUMO1) conjugates were increased with increasing concentrations of sumoylated GST-hTOP1-(110-125) (Fig. 4B, lanes 3-6). This thrombin-digested product was further processed by SUMO isopeptidase Ulp1 (Ubl-specific protease 1). All SUMO1-hTOP1-(110-125) conjugates were expected to be cleaved into the SUMO1 monomer and the hTOP1-(110-125) peptide, and the SUMO1 mono"
https://openalex.org/W2152461652,"Spermatogenesis is a complex process involving cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) is involved in testicular function, but its role in spermatogenesis has not been fully documented. The control of FGF-2 expression particularly occurs at the translational level, by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent mechanism driving the use of alternative initiation codons. To study IRES activity regulation in vivo, we have developed transgenic mice expressing a bicistronic construct coding for two luciferase genes. Here, we show that the FGF-2 IRES is age-dependently activated in mouse testis, whereas EMCV and c-myc IRESs are not. Real-time PCR confirms that this regulation is translational. By using immunohistological techniques, we demonstrate that FGF-2 IRES stimulation occurs in adult, but not in immature, type-A spermatogonias. This is correlated with activation of endogenous FGF-2 expression in spermatogonia; whereas FGF-2 mRNA transcription is known to decrease in adult testis. Interestingly, the FGF-2 IRES activation is triggered by testosterone and is partially inhibited by siRNA directed against the androgen receptor. Two-dimensional analysis of proteins bound to the FGF-2 mRNA 5'UTR after UV cross-linking reveals that testosterone treatment correlates with the binding of several proteins. These data suggest a paracrine loop where IRES-dependent FGF-2 expression, stimulated by Sertoli cells in response to testosterone produced by Leydig cells, would in turn activate Leydig function and testosterone production. In addition, nuclear FGF-2 isoforms could be involved in an intracrine function of FGF-2 in the start of spermatogenesis, mitosis, or meiosis initiation. This report demonstrates that mRNA translation regulation by an IRES-dependent mechanism participates in a physiological process."
https://openalex.org/W1996612608,"The fission yeast HIRA proteins Hip1 and Slm9 are members of an evolutionarily conserved family of histone chaperones that are implicated in nucleosome assembly. Here we have used single-step affinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify factors that interact with both Hip1 and Slm9. This analysis identified Hip3, a previously uncharacterized 187-kDa protein, with similarity to S. cerevisiae Hir3. Consistent with this, cells disrupted for hip3+ exhibit a range of growth defects that are similar to those associated with loss of Hip1 and Slm9. These include temperature sensitivity, a cell cycle delay, and synthetic lethality with cdc25-22. Furthermore, genetic analysis also indicates that disruption of hip3+ is epistatic with mutation of hip1+ and slm9+. Mutation of hip3+ alleviates transcriptional silencing at several heterochromatic loci, including in the outer (otr) centromeric repeats, indicating that Hip3 is required for the integrity of pericentric heterochromatin. As a result, loss of Hip3 function leads to high levels of minichromosome loss and an increased frequency of lagging chromosomes during mitosis. Importantly, the function of Hip1, Slm9, and Hip3 is not restricted to constitutive heterochromatic loci, since these proteins also repress the expression of a number of genes, including the Tf2 retrotransposons.

Centromeres play a critical role in the precise segregation of chromosomes, and as a result, defects in centromere function lead to aneuploidy (1Pluta A.F. Mackay A.M. Ainsztein A.M. Goldberg I.G. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe provides an excellent system for the study of centromeres (2Pidoux A.L. Allshire R.C. Chromosome Res. 2004; 12: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast to the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has simple “point” centromeres (3Hegemann J.H. Fleig U.N. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), S. pombe has large complex centromeres that occupy between 35 and 110 kb and are arranged as a central core (cnt) flanked by arrays of repeated (imr and otr) elements (2Pidoux A.L. Allshire R.C. Chromosome Res. 2004; 12: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this respect, S. pombe centromeres are reminiscent of the complex regional centromeres of metazoans. Furthermore, ultrastructural studies have revealed that the overall architectural organization of fission yeast centromeres is conserved with their human counterparts (4Kniola B. O'Toole E. McIntosh J.R. Mellone B. Allshire R. Mengarelli S. Hultenby K. Ekwall K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fission yeast centromeres are organized into distinct chromatin domains (2Pidoux A.L. Allshire R.C. Chromosome Res. 2004; 12: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Partridge J.F. Borgstrom B. Allshire R.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An inner domain is assembled into specialized chromatin in which core histone H3 is replaced by Cnp1, the fission yeast homologue of CENP-A (6Takahashi K. Chen E.S. Yanagida M. Science. 2000; 288: 2215-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), whereas the outer regions are associated with chromatin that resembles the pericentric heterochromatin of higher cells (2Pidoux A.L. Allshire R.C. Chromosome Res. 2004; 12: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Marker genes inserted into these outer regions are subject to heritable inactivation (7Allshire R.C.

Science. 2001; 292: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). In addition, the integrity of pericentric heterochromatin in fission yeast is dependent upon the two HIRA proteins Hip1 and Slm9 (13Blackwell C. Martin K.A. Greenall A. Pidoux A. Allshire R.C. Whitehall S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4309-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Kanoh J. Russell P. Genetics. 2000; 155: 623-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), since loss of either protein alleviates silencing in the otr centromeric repeats and results in increased levels of chromosome missegregation (13Blackwell C. Martin K.A. Greenall A. Pidoux A. Allshire R.C. Whitehall S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4309-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The S. pombe HIRA proteins Hip1 and Slm9 are members of a family of histone chaperones that are conserved in all eukaryotes (15Kirov N. Shtilbans A. Rushlow C. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae also has two HIRA proteins (Hir1 and Hir2) (16Spector M.S. Raff A. DeSilva H. Lee K. Osley M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Spector M.S. Osley M.A. Genetics. 1993; 135: 25-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas higher eukaryotes have a single protein (15Kirov N. Shtilbans A. Rushlow C. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Scamps C. Lorain S. Lamour V. Lipinski M. Biochim. Biophys.

Genet. 1995; 4: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). HIRA proteins were originally identified in S. cerevisiae as repressors of histone expression, since mutation of HIR1 or HIR2 was found to result in the constitutive transcription of six of the eight budding yeast histone genes (17Spector M.S. Osley M.A. Genetics. 1993; 135: 25-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Xu H. Kim U.J. Schuster T. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 5249-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Subsequently, HIRA proteins have been implicated in nucleosome assembly and the organization of repressive chromatin (13Blackwell C. Martin K.A. Greenall A. Pidoux A. Allshire R.C. Whitehall S.K.

Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4793-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, HIRA has been identified as a critical component of a replication-independent nucleosome deposition pathway (26Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Scamps C. Martini E.M. Lipinski M. Almouzni G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 27Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in budding yeast, HIRA proteins functionally overlap with CAF-1 (chromatin assembly factor 1), since the mutation of HIR1 or HIR2 exacerbates the chromosome segregation and transcriptional silencing defects associated with loss of CAF-1 (23Qian Z. Huang H. Hong J.Y. Burck C.L. Johnston S.D. Berman J. Carol A. Liebman S.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4783-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Kaufman P.D. Cohen J.L. Osley M.A. Mol.

The fission yeast HIRA proteins Hip1 and Slm9 are required for heterochromatic silencing at centromeres and also at the mating type (mat) region even in the presence of functional CAF-1 (13Blackwell C. Martin K.A. Greenall A. Pidoux A. Allshire R.C. Whitehall S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4309-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, human HIRA has been shown to be required for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin in human cells (24Zhang R. Poustovoitov M.V. Ye X. Santos H.A. Chen W. Daganzo S.M. Erzberger J.P. Serebriiskii I.G. Canutescu A.A. Dunbrack R.L. Pehrson J.R. Berger J.M. Kaufman P.D. Adams P.D. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), indicating that HIRAs have roles in repressive chromatin in mammals. Xenopus and human HIRA proteins have been found to be components of large but poorly defined protein complexes (26Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Scamps C. Martini E.M. Lipinski M. Almouzni G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 29De Lucia F. Lorain S. Scamps C. Galisson F. MacHold J. Lipinski M. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and here we demonstrate that the S. pombe proteins Hip1 and Slm9 are also components of large protein complexes. Moreover, we have used affinity purifications coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) 3The abbreviations used are: MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; TBZ, thiabendazole. mass spectrometry to identify potential components of these complexes. This analysis revealed that both Hip1 and Slm9 co-purify with a 187-kDa protein that we have called Hip3. Disruption of hip3+ results in a range of phenotypes that are highly similar to those associated with mutation of hip1+ or slm9+. These include temperature sensitivity, a cell cycle delay, increased rates of chromosome missegregation, and defective heterochromatic silencing. Furthermore, genetic analysis indicates that mutations in hip1+, slm9+, and hip3+ are epistatic. Thus, the data suggest that Hip1, Slm9, and Hip3 function on a nucleosome assembly pathway that is required for the integrity of heterochromatin and accurate chromosome segregation. Plasmids and Strains—Routine culture of S. pombe and general genetic methods were performed as described previously (30Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). The strains used in this study are described in Table 1. The hip3+ open reading frame was disrupted using one-step gene replacement. An 846-bp fragment from the 5′-end of the hip3+ open reading frame was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides Hip3KOA (5′-ACGTTTACTCCTCTAAATGCG-3′) and Hip3KOB (5′-GCTCAAATTCAGGGAATGAAC-3′) and then cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) to yield pGEM-Hip3. The 1.8-kb ura4+ cassette from pRep42 was then cloned into the HindIII site to give plasmid pGEM-Hip3::ura4+. The BglII fragment from pGEM-Hip3::ura4+ was used to transform an NT4/NT5 diploid strain and integration at the correct locus was confirmed by PCR. A LEU2-based hip3+ disruption allele was constructed as described above except that the 2.2-kb LEU2 cassette from pRep41 (31Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) was first cloned into the HindIII site of pGEM-Hip3. A vector for the expression of TAP-tagged fusion proteins was constructed. The ars1 sequence was removed from pRep42EGFP (32Craven R.A. Griffiths D.J. Sheldrick K.S. Randall R.E. Hagan I.M. Carr A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI followed by religation to yield pRip42EGFP. A fragment containing two copies of the TAP epitope from pFA6a-CTAP-MX6 (33Tasto J.J. Carnahan R.H. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L. Yeast. 2001; 18: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides TAPF (5′-GACTCAGGATCCCCGGGTATGAAGCGACGATGGAAAAAG-3′) and TAP2B (5′-GCTAGCCCATGGCCTTATTCTTTGTTGAATTTG-3′), cleaved with BamHI and NcoI and then cloned into the BamHI and NcoI sites of pRip42-EFGP to give plasmid pRip42-CTAP. The genomic locus of hip1+ was tagged with the TAP epitope by subcloning the PstI-XhoI fragment from pRip42-Hip1PkC (13Blackwell C. Martin K.A. Greenall A. Pidoux A. Allshire R.C. Whitehall S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4309-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) into pRip42-CTAP. The resulting plasmid was linearized with Bst98I and used to transform the desired strains. The genomic locus of slm9+ was tagged with the TAP and Pk epitopes by PCR-amplifying a C-terminal fragment of the slm9+ open reading frame with oligonucleotides 5′-CCGTACCTGCAGATTTGAGGAATCAGAGTTCGG-3′ and 5′-CGGATGGGATCCTAAAAGTGCAGATCGTCGTAA-3′. The fragment was digested with PstI and BamHI and cloned into the PstI and BamHI sites of pRip42-CTAP and pRip42-Pk. The resulting plasmids were digested with XbaI before being transformed into the desired strains. A ura4+-based vector for the expression of proteins as fusions with three copies of the FLAG epitope was constructed by PCR-amplifying a fragment from p3XFLAG-CMV (Sigma) using oligonucleotides 3XFLAG3′ (5′-GCTAGCTCCATGGATCACTACTTGTCATCGTC-3′) and 3XFLAG5′ (5′-CGTAGGCGGATCCCCGGGTGACTACAAAGACCATGACGGT-3′). The resulting fragment was digested with BamHI and NcoI and cloned into the BamHI and NcoI sites of pRip42EFGP to give plasmid pRip42-3XFLAG. For tagging of the genomic hip3+ locus, a fragment was amplified with oligonucleotides hip3BamHI (5′-GAACTGGGATCCTTGAATTTCTTCATGTATACCTG-3′) and hip3PstI (5′-GGACATCTGCAGTAATCCACGTCGACAAGATTC-3′), digested with PstI and BamHI, and cloned into pRip42-3XFLAG. The resulting plasmid (pRip42-Hip3-FLAG3X) was digested with BclI before being transformed into the appropriate strain. A LEU2-based plasmid for FLAG tagging of the hip3+ open reading frame was constructed by digesting pRip42-Hip3-FLAG3X with HindIII and cloning the LEU2-containing HindIII fragment from pRep41 to give pRip41-Hip3-3XFLAG.

They were then diluted with an equal volume of fresh, prewarmed YEP and incubated for a further 2 h. Cells were harvested and washed twice with chilled water and twice with HB buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaF). Pellets were resuspended in an equal volume (w/v) of HB buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and dripped into liquid nitrogen. Cells were disrupted by grinding in a mechanical pestle and mortar as described previously (34Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In order to purify the TAP-tagged proteins, powdered cell lysates were thawed at 4 °C and clarified by spinning at 15,000 rpm for 1 h. Proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with 500 μl of a 50% slurry of IgG-coupled Dynal beads pre-equilibrated into HB buffer. Beads were recovered and washed three times with HB buffer, three times with IPP150 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and once with TEV cleavage buffer (Invitrogen). Beads were resuspended in 0.5 ml TEV cleavage buffer, and protein complexes were released by the addition of 300 units of TEV protease and incubation at 25 °C for 1 h. The recovered eluates were concentrated by spinning in Vivaspin concentrator columns (10,000 molecular weight cutoff) and electrophoresed through Bio-Rad Criterion precast gels (4-20%). Gels were stained for 2 h with Simply Blue Safestain (Invitrogen), and bands were excised and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Protein Digestion—Gel pieces containing the protein of interest were excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel, cut into small pieces, rehydrated with 50 μl of water for 5 min, and then destained with 50 μl of 25 mm Tris, pH 8, in 50% acetonitrile for 30 min. 50 μl of reduction buffer (10 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phospine in 25 mm Tris, pH 8) was added and incubated for 30 min at 56 °C. Next, 50 μl of alkylation buffer containing 100 mm iodoacetamide in water was added and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The gel pieces were washed twice with 50 μl of water for 5 min and then dehydrated by washing twice with 100 μl of acetonitrile for 10 min at 30 °C. After drying under vacuum, the gel pieces were rehydrated on ice with 10 μl of digestion buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm CaCl2, and 25 ng of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). After 10 min, a further 10-20 μl of the same buffer (without trypsin) was added to cover the gel slices, and the digestions were then incubated for 16 h at 35 °C. The resulting tryptic peptides were then extracted twice using 10-20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile at 56 °C for 30 min. Pooled extracts were dried using a SpeedVac and then redissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and purified with Zip-Tip C18 pipette tips (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Peptides were eluted from the tip directly onto the MALDI plate with matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI Mass Spectrometry and Data Base Searching—The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer used was a Voyager DE-STR (Applied Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). The instrument was equipped with a delayed extraction ion source, used a nitrogen laser at 337 nm and was operated in reflector mode at accelerating voltages of 20-25 kV. Mass spectra were obtained over a mass range of 900-4000 Da, and monoisotopic peptide mass fingerprints were assigned and used for data base searches. Identifications were performed using the peptide mass fingerprint data and the Mascot search engine program (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK), where the peptide mass tolerance was limited to 50 ppm, and searched against the NCBI nonredundant protein sequence data base. Co-immunoprecipitations—Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (13Blackwell C. Martin K.A. Greenall A. Pidoux A. Allshire R.C. Whitehall S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4309-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) except that the standard lysis buffer was substituted with HB buffer. Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding 25 μl of IgG-coupled Dynal beads to 1 mg of whole protein extract and incubating for 1 h at 4°C with gentle agitation. Beads were recovered and washed three times with 1 ml of HB buffer. Samples were electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to Western blotting using monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) and/or a peroxidase anti-peroxidase-soluble complex produced in rabbits (Sigma). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Microscopy was performed as described previously (35Hagan I.M. Ayscough K.R. Allan V.J. Protein Localization by Fluorescence Microscopy. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 179-206Google Scholar). DAPI and fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was captured by exciting cells with 450-490-nm and 365-nm wavelengths, respectively, using a Zeiss Axioscope microscope with a × 63 oil immersion objective and Axiovision imaging software. RNA Analysis—RNA was purified and analyzed as described previously (13Blackwell C. Martin K.A. Greenall A. Pidoux A. Allshire R.C. Whitehall S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4309-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Gene-specific probes were produced by PCR amplification from genomic DNA using the appropriate primers. All probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using a Prime-a-Gene labeling kit (Promega). Hip1 and Slm9 Are Components of Large Protein Complexes—In higher cells, HIRA proteins have been reported to exist in large protein complexes (26Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Scamps C. Martini E.M.

In order to determine whether the S. pombe HIRA proteins are also part of multisubunit complexes, a strain was constructed in which the chromosomal copy of slm9+ was tagged with the 3XFLAG epitope and the chromosomal hip1+ gene was tagged with the Pk epitope. A whole cell extract from the resulting strain was then subjected to gel filtration chromatography. Western blotting revealed that significant pools of Hip1 and Slm9 co-eluted within high molecular mass fractions (greater than 450 kDa) (Fig. 1). The presence of Hip1 and Slm9 in these fractions was not a consequence of these particular epitope tags, since similar results were obtained with strains expressing alternatively tagged versions of Hip1 and Slm9 (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Since we have previously demonstrated that Hip1 and Slm9 interact, these results suggest that a portion of these factors co-exist in a large complex or complexes.FIGURE 2Hip3 co-purifies with Hip1 and Slm9. A, affinity-purified TAP fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Simply Blue Safestain (Invitrogen). The strains used are indicated above the lanes and were Pku-TAP (pku70-TAP), Hip1-TAP (SW307), and Slm9-TAP (SW365). B, Hip3 co-immunoprecipitates with Hip1 and Slm9. Whole cell extracts derived from the appropriate strains were immunoprecipitated with IgG-coupled magnetic beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with peroxidase anti-peroxidase (α-PAP) and anti-FLAG antibodies. The strains used were SW375 (lane 1), SW365 (lane 2), SW382 (lane 3), SW376 (lane 4), SW307 (lane 5), and SW385 (lane 6). C, whole cell extract from"
https://openalex.org/W2127413644,"Advances in understanding the relationship between protein structure and DNA binding specificity have made it possible to engineer zinc finger protein (ZFP) transcription factors to specifically activate or repress virtually any gene. To evaluate the potential clinical utility of this approach for peripheral vascular disease, we investigated the ability of an engineered vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFa)-activating ZFP (MVZ+426b) to induce angiogenesis and rescue hindlimb ischemia in a murine model. Hindlimb ischemia was surgically induced in advanced-age C57/BL6 mice. Adenovirus (Ad) encoding either MVZ+426b or the fluorescent marker dsRed was delivered to the adducter muscle of the ischemic hindlimb, and the effects on blood flow, limb salvage, and vascularization were assessed. Ad-MVZ+426b induced expression of VEGFa at the mRNA and protein levels and stimulated a significant increase in vessel counts in the ischemic limb. This was accompanied by significantly increased blood flow and limb salvage as measured serially for 4 wk. These data demonstrate that activation of the endogenous VEGFa gene by an engineered ZFP can induce angiogenesis in a clinically relevant model and further document the feasibility of designing ZFPs to therapeutically regulate gene expression in vivo."

We used this finding to investigate the interplay between arrestin binding and the status of the retinal chromophore ligand in the receptor binding pocket. Our results showed that arrestin can interact with the late photoproduct Meta III and convert it to a Meta II-like species. Interestingly in these mixed micelles, the release of retinal and arrestin was no longer directly coupled as it is in the native rod disk membrane. For example, up to ∼50% of the retinal could be released even though arrestin remains bound to the receptor in a long lived complex. We anticipate that this new ability to study these proteins in a defined, purified system will facilitate further structural and dynamic studies of arrestin-rhodopsin interactions.

In the dark, the chromophore (11-cis-retinal) is linked to Rho at Lys296 by a protonated Schiff base (λmax ∼ 500 nm). Light absorption isomerizes the chromophore to all-trans-retinal. Within milliseconds two photoproducts evolve, Meta I (λmax ∼ 480 nm) and Meta II (λmax ∼ 380 nm), which are in a pH- and temperature-sensitive equilibrium. The ability of Meta II to bind and activate the G-protein transducin (4Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) is terminated in several ways. Meta II can decay through hydrolysis of the Schiff base linkage and release of retinal, a process that takes ∼1 min at physiological temperature and pH (5Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Alternatively Meta II can decay to the long lived retinal storage photoproduct Meta III (λmax ∼ 470 nm) in which the Schiff base is intact and protonated (6Heck M. Schadel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J.

Vision Res. 1997; 37: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally Rho signaling can be blocked through a series of protein-protein interactions that involves phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of Rho by Rho kinase and binding of the protein arrestin (10Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Earlier we found that these inactivation mechanisms are related. That is, arrestin release and retinal release appear to be directly linked events: both are described by similar activation energies, and arrestin slows the rate of retinal release ∼2-fold at physiological temperatures. Intriguingly we also found that a fraction of the arrestin remains bound to ROS*-P long after “active” Meta II decay (5Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present work, we expanded upon these studies and made several surprising discoveries. First, we found that adding phospholipids restores arrestin binding to purified Rho*-P solubilized in n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DM). Second, we clearly established in the mixed micelle system that arrestin interacts with the post-Meta II photodecay product Meta III. Finally we found that arrestin and retinal release appear to be unlinked in mixed micelles with the acidic phospholipids PS, PI, and PA showing a more pronounced effect than the neutral phospholipids PC and PE (Fig. 1 shows a scheme of the different lipid head groups). Intriguingly with the acidic phospholipids, arrestin dissociation was nearly completely inhibited, yet approximately half of the retinal was released with the remainder trapped in the binding pocket.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Rho was purified using concanavalin A. Briefly ROS containing 1 mg of Rho was solubilized in 14 ml of Buffer A containing 1% DM (mixing for 30 min at 4 °C) and then clarified by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 30 min). The supernatant was added to concanavalin A-Sepharose (400 μl of settled beads, equilibrated with Buffer A plus 0.1% DM) and incubated overnight at 4 °C while mixing. Washing occurred batchwise: the beads were pelleted using a clinical centrifuge (2,000 rpm for 3 min), the supernatant was removed, fresh buffer was added, and the beads were mixed for 10 min (4 °C). The beads were washed three times with 15 ml of Buffer A plus 0.1% DM, three times with Buffer B plus 0.1% DM, and two times with Buffer C plus 0.05% DM. After transferring the beads to a microcolumn, Rho was eluted with Buffer C plus 0.05% DM and 0.3 m methyl α-d-mannopyranoside. Rho concentration was ascertained by absorbance at 500 nm (ϵ = 40,800 liters cm-1 mol-1), and aliquots were snap frozen and stored at -80 °C. After thawing, Rho samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and the concentration was reassessed before use in experiments. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Arrestin—The bovine visual arrestin cDNA with a single glycine inserted at residue 2 (a generous gift from V. V. Gurevich) was cloned in the pET15b vector (Invitrogen) for bacterial expression. Mutant constructs W194F and I72C/W194F were created using PCR, and the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Arrestin was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as described previously with some modifications (11Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Engelman D.M. Sigler P.B. Fleming K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21186-21190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A single colony was used to inoculate 400 ml of LB plus ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and this culture was grown while shaking at 37 °C overnight. This culture was then split between four flasks (each containing 1 liter of LB + ampicillin) and grown at 30 °C while shaking. Upon reaching an A595 of 0.6, the cultures were induced with 30 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 16–20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × g for 15 min), resuspended in cold Buffer D, and lysed by two passes through a French press (20,000 p.s.i.). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (27,000 × g for 30 min). Ammonium sulfate was added to a concentration of 0.32 g/ml, and the precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation (27,000 × g for 30 min). The pellet was resuspended in Buffer E and centrifuged again before being dialyzed overnight against Buffer E plus 0.1 m NaCl. The dialyzed lysate was loaded onto a HiTrap heparin column (20 ml) equilibrated with Buffer E plus 0.1 m NaCl. The column was washed with ∼200 ml of Buffer E plus 0.1 m NaCl. After elution by a linear gradient of 0.1-0.5 m NaCl, the arrestin-containing fractions were determined by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed overnight against Buffer F plus 0.1 m NaCl. The dialyzed fractions were loaded onto a HiTrap Q column (5 ml) equilibrated with Buffer F. The dialyzed fractions were diluted 1:10 with buffer F while loading onto the column. The loaded column was washed with 50 ml of Buffer F, and arrestin was eluted with a two-step gradient: 0-0.1 m and 0.1-0.5 m NaCl. The arrestin-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼2.5 mg/ml, snap frozen, and stored at -80 °C. The purity of the recombinant arrestin was >95% as ascertained by SDS-PAGE, and the yield was typically 5–6 mg of arrestin. Labeling of Arrestin—Arrestin samples were labeled with monobromobimane as described previously (5Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) except that no His tag selection was used. Briefly arrestin samples were buffer-exchanged (5 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) and concentrated, and monobromobimane was added in 10-fold molar excess to arrestin. After a 3-h incubation at room temperature, the majority of the free label was removed by ultrafiltration (Millipore Biomax). The labeled arrestin was then passed over a size exclusion column (500 μl, Sephadex G-15) to remove trace free label and buffer-exchanged into 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The labeling efficiency was calculated as described previously (5Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); recombinant arrestin I72C/W194F labeled at ∼92% efficiency, and recombinant arrestin W194F labeled at less than 2% efficiency. No free label contamination was detected in the labeled arrestin samples. Centrifugal pull-down analysis (5Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed arrestin W194F and bimane-labeled I72C/W194F to have essentially the same affinity for Rho*-P as that of wild-type arrestin (data not shown). Preparation of Mixed Micelles—For experiments using mixed micelles of ROS phospholipids and DM, ROS containing 50 μm Rho-P was solubilized in 1% DM. The membranes were dispersed in the detergent by continuous sonication (25 °C for 2 min, Branson 1210) followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min to pellet the insoluble material. This stock of solubilized ROS-P was diluted into buffer containing different amounts of DM, and samples were sonicated briefly and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h to allow equilibration of the micelles. For experiments using asolectin, an appropriate volume of 1% DM was added to a portion of powdered asolectin to yield a stock of 1% asolectin/DM. The solution was passed multiple times through a fine needle to disperse the phospholipids and was clarified by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 20 min) before use. For all experiments, DM and asolectin stocks were diluted in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to give a final DM concentration of 0.02%. For molarity calculations of asolectin, an average phospholipid molecular mass of 750 g/mol was assumed. For experiments using purified phospholipids, a measured volume of the chloroform stock corresponding to 1 mg of phospholipid (as supplied from Avanti) was dispersed into a glass test tube, and the chloroform was evaporated with a continuous stream of argon. The dried lipid film was then resuspended in a volume of 1% DM in buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) by vortexing and multiple freeze-thaw cycles to give a final phospholipid concentration of 5 mm. All phospholipid suspensions were stored in the dark and handled under argon to avoid lipid oxidation, and lipid stocks were clarified by centrifugation (30,000 × g for 10 min) before use. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—All steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were made as described previously (5Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The tryptophanless arrestin mutant W194F was used, for it contributes less background while measuring opsin tryptophan fluorescence in samples of Rho and arrestin. Because asolectin exhibits some intrinsic fluorescence, background controls were measured and subtracted from appropriate fluorescence spectra. UV-visible Absorbance Spectroscopy—All UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer using a bandwidth of 2 nm. For the photodecay experiments, the absorbance of 1 μm Rho-P (120 μl) was recorded in the dark after base lining with the appropriate buffer. The sample was photoactivated using a 150-watt fiber optic light source (>495 nm) for 20 s, and spectra were subsequently recorded every 90 s for 120 min. The presence of Schiff base was ascertained by the addition of 5 μl of 0.8 n H2SO4. NaBH4 Reduction and V8 Proteolysis of Rho—Reduction of the Schiff base in Rho with NaBH4 results in the fluorescent n-retinylidene opsin species (λex, 340 nm; λem, 480 nm) (13Bownds D. Wald G. Nature. 1965; 205: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Samples of 3 μm Rho-P, with or without 6 μm arrestin, solubilized in 0.02% DM, 0.02% DM and 0.02% asolectin, or 0.02% DM and 100 μm purified phospholipid (20 μl) were photoactivated using a 150-watt fiber optic light source (>495 nm) for 20 s and allowed to decay at 20 °C in the dark. After 120 min, 5 μl of 1% NaBH4 (made fresh in water) was added to each sample. After 10 min, 15 μl of 1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) was added, each sample was split into two 20-μl aliquots, and 5 μl of 4.8 μm V8 protease was added to half the samples. Proteolysis occurred for 30 min at room temperature. To assess the amount of Schiff base present in Meta II Rho immediately after activation, 1% NaBH4 was added to Rho-P (0.02% DM) in the dark. The sample was then photoactivated at 4 °C and immediately processed as described above. Bands were resolved by 15% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE, and gels were soaked in 30% methanol before visualization. The n-retinylidene opsin was excited with a short wave UV source (Alpha-Innotech FluorChem 5500 imaging system), and the fluorescent bands were detected by a charge-coupled device camera (535 ± 50-nm cutoff filter, 10-min exposure). AlphaEase FC software was used to quantify the fluorescence of the bands. Our results here indicate the following. 1) Phospholipids are required to enable Rho-arrestin interactions in detergent micelles. 2) In mixed DM/phospholipid micelles, arrestin interacts with Meta III and converts it to a Meta II-like species. 3) Arrestin release is significantly inhibited from Rho*-P in mixed micelles containing acidic phospholipids, while half of the retinal is trapped in the binding pocket. Details are given below. Arrestin Has Reduced Affinity for DM-purified Rho*-P—The binding of bimane-labeled arrestin I72C/W914F (I72B) to Rho*-P in native membranes resulted in an increase (∼40%) and a blue shift (∼15 nm) in fluorescence (Fig. 2A). However, when Rho-P was purified from ROS and solubilized in DM, the fluorescence changes were dramatically reduced, indicating a loss of arrestin binding (Fig. 2B). Asolectin Stimulates Arrestin Binding to DM-purified Rho*-P—Adding asolectin (a mixture of phospholipids often used in Rho reconstitution (15Niu L. Kim J.M. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13409-13412Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), to DM-purified Rho-P restores I72B binding: the fluorescence increased ∼70% and blue shifted ∼15 nm after photoactivation (Fig. 2C). Dilution of ROS Lipids with Detergent Inhibits Arrestin Binding to Rho*-P—We determined the effect of decreasing the apparent concentration of native ROS lipids on arrestin binding using DM (Fig. 2D). Rather than purify ROS lipids and add them back to purified Rho-P, we fully solubilized native ROS-P membranes and then added this mixture to buffer containing low to high concentrations of DM (0.02–1.0%). In this way, the relative Rho/phospholipid ratio was preserved, but the number of micelles into which the phospholipids could segregate was increased. This process ensured that minimal oxidation or damage occurred to the ROS lipids. A similar approach has been used previously in control experiments involving ROS lipids (16Gibson N.J. Brown M.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2438-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). When this DM-solubilized ROS-P was added to 0.02% DM (micelle concentration, ∼3 μm), 3This calculation assumes that the aggregation number of 132 molecules of DM/micelle (57Dupuy C. Auvray X. Petipas C. Langmuir. 1997; 13: 3965Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) is not dramatically changed by the presence of ROS phospholipids. arrestin could bind as indicated by the ∼70% increase and 15-nm blue shift in fluorescence. However, at higher DM concentrations, binding was dramatically inhibited (Fig. 2D). In 1% DM (micelle concentration, ∼150 μm), the fluorescence of arrestin I72B increased only ∼17% and blue shifted less than 2 nm after light activation. Assuming the ROS phospholipids distribute evenly to all micelles, we interpret this result to reflect the ability of DM to solubilize ROS phospholipids away from Rho. Although DM might directly inhibit arrestin binding, the addition of sufficient amounts of exogenous phospholipids, even at high DM concentrations, could rescue arrestin binding (see Fig. 2E, inset). ∼50 Phospholipids per Rho-P Are Required for Arrestin Binding—We quantified the phospholipid effect by titrating asolectin in samples of DM-purified Rho-P (Fig. 2E). These studies indicate that ∼0.015% asolectin, or ∼200 μm phospholipid, is required to achieve maximal arrestin binding under conditions where there is roughly one Rho per micelle. This corresponds to ∼67 phospholipids per Rho. Interestingly this is similar to the Rho/phospholipid ratio in the ROS where Rho composes half the volume of the tightly stacked membranous organelles (17Anderson R.E. Maude M.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3624-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18Daemen F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 300: 255-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 19Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2491-2513PubMed Google Scholar). When 10-fold more DM was present, correspondingly more phospholipid was required (0.1–0.12% asolectin) (Fig. 2E, inset). Again this value corresponds to ∼50 phospholipids per micelle. Some Retinal and Arrestin Release Is Inhibited in Mixed Micelles—We used a fluorescence dual rate assay (5Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to investigate the various dynamics of arrestin and retinal release. This assay monitors release of retinal as an increase in the tryptophan fluorescence of opsin (14Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) while simultaneously measuring dissociation of arrestin I72B as a decrease in bimane fluorescence. We determined the maximal and minimal fluorescence values possible for each process (the “plateaus”) by adding hydroxylamine, a compound that cleaves the Schiff base and converts all remaining photoproducts to opsin and free retinaloxime. Fig. 3, A, C, and E, compare retinal and arrestin release from Rho*-P in pure DM micelles or mixed micelles containing ROS phospholipids or asolectin. The half-lives (t½) of retinal and arrestin release and the relative levels of retinal trapping and arrestin binding are given in Tables 1 and 2. The data are briefly summarized below.TABLE 1Effect of arrestin on the rate of retinal release and amount of trapped retinal Values are derived from experiments described in Figs. 3 and 5 and, for the native membrane sample, from work published previously (5Sommer M.E.

Murine thrombin has Asp-222 in the Na+ binding site of the human enzyme replaced by Lys. The charge reversal substitution abrogates Na+ activation, which is partially restored with the K222D mutation, and ensures high activity even in the absence of Na+. This property makes the murine enzyme more resistant to the effect of mutations that destabilize Na+ binding and shift thrombin to its anticoagulant slow form. Compared with the human enzyme, murine thrombin cleaves fibrinogen and protein C with similar kcat/Km values but activates PAR1 and PAR4 with kcat/Km values 4- and 26-fold higher, respectively. The significantly higher specificity constant toward PAR4 accounts for the dominant role of this receptor in platelet activation in the mouse. Murine thrombin can also cleave substrates carrying Phe at P1, which potentially broadens the repertoire of molecular targets available to the enzyme in vivo.

Thrombin is a Na+-activated serine protease (1Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) that is responsible for the progression and regulation of blood coagulation (2Mann K.G.

Chem. 2006; 281: 1305-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the role of Na+ in thrombin function is to lower energy barriers for substrate binding in the ground and transition states so that physiologic substrates like PAR1 and fibrinogen can be hydrolyzed efficiently during platelet activation and formation of a blood clot. Other members of the vitamin K-dependent family of clotting proteases to which thrombin belongs are endowed with Na+ activation (4Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) is influenced significantly by the presence of Na+. Details of the molecular mechanism of Na+ activation in thrombin have emerged recently from mutagenesis and structural analysis (9Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W.

Na+ binding is severely compromised (>30-fold increase in Kd) upon mutation of Asp-189, Glu-217, Asp-222, and Tyr-225. Asp-189 fixes the orientation of one of the four water molecules ligating Na+ and provides an important link between the Na+ site and the P1 residue of substrate (10Prasad S. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Shih P. Xu H. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10103-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Glu-217 makes polar contacts with Lys-224 and Thr-172, which helps to stabilize the intervening 220-loop in the Na+ site. The ion pair between Arg-187 and Asp-222 latches the 186-loop onto the 220-loop to stabilize the Na+ site and the pore of entry of the cation to its binding site (11Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B.

The side chain of Tyr-225 also secures the integrity of the water channel embedding the primary specificity pocket (12Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T. Futterer K. Waksman G. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the backbone around Tyr-225 is oriented like the selectivity filter of the KcsA K+ channel (3Di Cera E. J. Biol.

Of these four residues, Glu-217 and Tyr-225 are conserved in thrombin from all species sequenced to date, from hagfish to human (14Banfield D.K. MacGillivray R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Asp-189 is a Ser in the sturgeon, and the D189S mutant of human thrombin has impaired Na+ binding and substrate recognition (10Prasad S. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Shih P. Xu H. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10103-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Asp-222 is the least conserved residue among the four. It is Ser in the sturgeon, Lys in the mouse, and Asn in the rat (14Banfield D.K. MacGillivray R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The substitution in the mouse is particularly interesting, as it involves a charge reversal in the 220-loop that has the potential to destabilize the Na+ binding environment. Does the presence of Lys-222 in murine thrombin preclude Na+ binding? If so, what compensates for the potential loss of catalytic activity? The D221A/D222K mutant of human thrombin is devoid of Na+ activation (15Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) due to complete disruption of the Na+ binding site (16Pineda A.O. Zhang E. Guinto E.R. Savvides S.N. Tulinsky A. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the mutant has functional properties intermediate between those of the Na+-free and Na+-bound forms of the wild type (15Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which suggests that murine thrombin can retain significant catalytic activity even in the absence of Na+ activation. On the other hand, Lys-222 is present in factor Xa, which is a Na+-activated enzyme (17Monnaie D. Arosio D. Griffon N. Rose T. Rezaie A.R. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5349-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hence, the alternative possibility exists that the D222K substitution in murine thrombin is inconsequential on Na+ binding. To address these questions directly, we expressed and purified to homogeneity murine thrombin. The results presented here fill an important gap in our understanding of an enzyme that has been the subject of numerous transgenic studies in recent years (18Sun W.Y. Witte D.P. Degen J.L. Colbert M.C. Burkart M.C. Holmback K. Xiao Q. Bugge T.H. Degen S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7597-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 19Coughlin S.R.

Construction of the Murine Pre-thrombin 1 Vector—The HPC4-pNUT expression vector containing the murine pre-thrombin 1 gene was constructed using the ribocloning technique (22Barnes W.M. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 441-449Google Scholar). The murine prethrombin 1 gene was amplified by PCR from the PCDNA3 vector (kindly provided by Dr. Jay Degen) using the following primers: 5′-TCTGGAGGTTCCAAGGACAATCTGTCACCTCC-3′ and 5′-CTATCCAAATTGATCAATGACTTTCTG-3′. The gene was prepared for insertion immediately following the HPC4 epitope in the HPC4-pNUT vector using two riboprimers and two “bandaid” primers. Klen-Taq long and accurate DNA polymerase (22Barnes W.M. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 441-449Google Scholar) was used at pH 7.9 for the PCR. The HPC4-pNUT target was prepared using two riboprimers that amplified the vector with an insertion gap for the murine pre-thrombin 1 gene. Following PCR, DpnI was added to eliminate parent DNA. The amplified products were precipitated with PEG 2The abbreviations used are: PEG, polyethylene glycol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and washed with 70% ethanol. After resuspension in DNA buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9), RNase A was added to cut the plasmid/gene at the ribobases resulting in sticky ends on the target plasmid and the amplified murine pre-thrombin 1 gene. RNase A was digested by addition of proteinase K. The prepared HPC4-pNUT target and the prepared murine pre-thrombin 1 gene insert were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio in DNA buffer with 0.5 m NaCl and annealed by heating at 75 °C for 4 min followed by slow cooling to 25 °C over 60 min. The product was then transformed directly into XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene) and plated on low salt LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin for selection. Plasmid DNA was isolated and purified from single colonies using Maxipreps from Qiagen. The K222D and W215A/E217A mutants were constructed with the QuikChange system (Stratagene) using the HPC-4-pNUT murine pre-thrombin 1 plasmid as a template. Transformation and plasmid purification were done as described for the wild type. Expression and Activation of Murine Thrombin—Expression of wild-type and mutant K222D and W215A/E217A murine thrombins was carried out in a baby hamster kidney cell system as described for human thrombin (12Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T. Futterer K. Waksman G. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The expressed murine thrombin was concentrated using a Quixstand tangential flow system and purified on an HPC4 antibody column before activation. Activation was carried out overnight using the snake venom enzyme ecarin (American Diagnostica). Activated thrombin was purified to homogeneity by FPLC using Resource Q and S columns with a linear gradient from 0.04 to 1 m choline chloride (ChCl), 5 mm MES, pH 6.0, at room temperature. The active site concentration was determined by titration with hirudin. Functional Assays—Wild-type trypsin and tissue-type plasminogen activator were expressed, purified, and tested for activity as described (23Bobofchak K.M. Pineda A.O. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25644-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Vindigni A. Winfield M. Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Chymotrypsin was from Sigma. Activated protein C, factor Xa, factor XIa, and plasmin were from Enzyme Research. The substrates H-d-Phe-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (FPF) and H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (FPR) were from MidWest Biotech, and Spectrozyme-TH was from American Diagnostica. Measurements of the Michaelis-Menten parameters kcat and s = kcat/Km were carried out from direct integration of progress curves of substrate hydrolysis taking into account product inhibition (25Krem M.M. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 100: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The dependence of these parameters on [Na+] was fit according to the equations (26Di Cera E. Hopfner K.P. Dang Q.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar),s=s0+s1Kax1+Kax(Eq. 1) kcat=kcat,0+kcat,1Ka'x1+Ka'x(Eq. 2) where x = [Na+], s0 and s1 are the values of s for x = 0 and x = ∞, kcat,0 and kcat,1 are the values of kcat for x = 0 and x = ∞, and Ka and Ka′ are the equilibrium association constants for Na+ binding to the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. Experimental conditions were 50 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. The ionic strength was kept constant at 200 mm by replacing NaCl with ChCl. Under these conditions, murine thrombin was subject to very significant product inhibition in the presence of FPR, which prevented accurate measurements of Km. The values of s = kcat/Km could not be estimated with confidence, because even substrate concentrations as low as 1 μm were apparently saturating. In the process of screening alternative substrates that would retain a Na+ effect in the human enzyme for comparison with murine thrombin, we selected Spectrozyme-TH for our titration studies. We also found that thrombin would cleave FPF with values of s comparable with those of chymotrypsin, in agreement with studies on ester substrates published more than 40 years ago (27Martin C.J. Golubow J. Axelrod A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1718-1725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lorand L. Brannen Jr., W.T. Rule N.G. Arch. Biochem.

Fibrinogen and protein C (murine and human; from Hematologic Technologies) were used for the characterization of murine thrombin under experimental conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. The assays were performed as described for the human enzyme-substrate interactions (30Dang O.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 31Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The interaction of murine thrombin with murine PAR1 and PAR4 was studied as for the analogous human enzyme-substrate interactions (33Arosio D. Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8095-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) from the kinetics of cleavage of soluble fragments corresponding to the extracellular portion of the murine receptors. These fragments were synthesized by solid phase chromatography, purified to homogeneity by high pressure liquid chromatography, and tested for purity by mass spectrometry. Their sequences were (↓ = site of cleavage) 32ERTDATVNPR↓SFFLRNPSENTFELVPLGDEE63 for PAR1 and 51KSSDKPNPR↓GYPGKFCANDSDTLELPASSQA81 for PAR4. Fluorescence measurements of Na+ binding were carried out as reported (11Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13785-13790Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using a FluoroMax-3 SPEX spectrophotometer, under experimental conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 8.0, at 10 °C, I = 800 mm. Control experiments of FPF hydrolysis by murine thrombin were carried out under identical solution conditions. Fig. 1 shows the effect of Na+ on the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate Spectrozyme-TH by human thrombin. With this substrate, the value of s = kcat/Km increases 70-fold from 1.8 μm–1 s–1 at [Na+] = 0 to 125 μm–1 s–1 at saturating [Na+]. The effect is observed at an ionic strength of 200 mm kept constant with ChCl. The value of kcat for this substrate also changes significantly from 15 s–1 at [Na+] = 0 to 91 s–1 at saturating [Na+]. The values of Ka and Ka′ derived from titration of s and kcat are 33 and 45 m–1, respectively. When the same titrations are carried out with murine thrombin, the values of s and kcat are constant over the entire [Na+] range and fall in between those of the slow ([Na+] = 0) and fast ([Na+] = ∞) forms. This shows that murine thrombin is not a Na+-activated enzyme. However, the enzyme retains significant catalytic activity because the value of s is almost 20-fold higher than that of the slow form of human thrombin. We surmised that the presence of Lys-222 in the Na+ binding loop of murine thrombin prevents Na+ binding but, at the same time, provides a partial functional mimicry of the Na+ effect by stabilizing the enzyme in a conformation similar to that of the fast form of the human enzyme (see below). In the human enzyme, the D222A replacement compromises Na+ binding (9Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The D221A/D222K double mutant is devoid of Na+ activation (15Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and its structure shows no evidence of bound Na+ (16Pineda A.O. Zhang E. Guinto E.R. Savvides S.N. Tulinsky A. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the mutant has functional properties intermediate to those of the slow and fast forms of the wild type (15Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To directly test the role of Lys-222 in murine thrombin, we replaced it with Asp. The K222D mutation restores a great deal of Na+ activation, as revealed most eloquently by the kcat (Fig. 1); the value of s increases from 39 μm–1 s–1 at [Na+] = 0 to 69 μm–1 s–1 at saturating [Na+], and the value of kcat increases from 21 s–1 at [Na+] = 0 to 80 s–1 at saturating [Na+]. The Na+ affinity of this mutant is very close to human thrombin, with Ka and Ka′ values of 25 and 100 m–1, respectively. Another intriguing property of murine thrombin is its ability to cleave amide substrates specific for chymotrypsin. Thrombin specificity is considered trypsin-like because of the presence of Asp-189 in the primary specificity pocket and the fact that all known physiologic substrates carry Arg at P1, with the sole exception of Lys in PAR3 (35Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, murine thrombin cleaves FPF with a value of s comparable with that of chymotrypsin and several orders of magnitude higher than that of trypsin (Fig. 2). This property is shared by the human enzyme and stands in contrast to other clotting and fibrinolytic proteases carrying Asp-189 (Fig. 2). As for Spectrozyme-TH carrying Arg at P1, cleavage of FPF shows a significant Na+ effect in the human enzyme but not in murine thrombin. Interestingly, murine thrombin cleaves FPF with a value of s similar to that of the fast form of human thrombin, and the Na+ effect is restored in the K222D mutant. These changes confirm the importance of the linkage between Na+ binding and the S1 site of the enzyme documented by structural (9Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and mutagenesis (10Prasad S. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Shih P. Xu H. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10103-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) studies. Although FPF lacks a charged P1 moiety, the side chain of Phe at P1 is still capable of sensing the Na+ induced changes around the environment of Asp-189 in the primary specificity pocket. The ability of thrombin to cleave chymotrypsin-specific substrates was discovered more than 40 years ago; bovine thrombin was found capable of hydrolyzing ester substrates carrying Phe at P1 with values of s comparable with those of chymotrypsin (27Martin C.J. Golubow J. Axelrod A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1718-1725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lorand L. Brannen Jr., W.T. Rule N.G. Arch. Biochem.

Surprisingly, this important observation has had little impact on subsequent studies of thrombin specificity toward synthetic amide substrates (36Butenas S. DiLorenzo M.E. Mann K.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Lottenberg R. Hall J.A. Blinder M. Binder E.P. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), including recent large scale profiling (38Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Leonetti F. Craik C.S. Ellman J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 39Gosalia D.N. Salisbury C.M. Maly D.J. Ellman J.A. Diamond S.L. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The trypsin-like specificity of thrombin has never been put to experimental test by changing the P1 position of amide substrate to residues other than Arg or Lys. Fluorescence measurements of Na+ binding to murine thrombin fail to report any significant change up to 800 mm [Na+] (Fig. 3). In the case of K222D, the fluorescence change is <2% relative to the base line, even though the mutant experiences up to 5-fold increases in the kinetic parameters of cleavage of FPF under identical solution conditions. This suggests that binding of Na+ to the mutant is not linked to significant changes in the environment of Trp residues, unlike what is observed with the human enzyme (33Arosio D. Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8095-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Trp-215 may be locked in a rigid conformation in murine thrombin, or concomitant changes at other Trp residues may cancel out the effects seen in the human enzyme. The ability of murine thrombin to retain high catalytic activity in the absence of Na+ activation is demonstrated by cleavage of Spectrozyme-TH (Fig. 1) and especially by the hydrolysis of FPF (Fig. 2). Functional mimicry of the fast form of human thrombin by the murine enzyme is supported by its interaction with physiologic substrates (Table 1). Under physiologic conditions of salt, pH, and temperature, cleavage of fibrinogen occurs with a value of kcat/Km = 27 μm–1 s–1, which is higher than the value measured for the human enzyme and very close to the value of 31 μm–1 s–1 measured for the fast form (30Dang O.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cleavage of protein C under saturating concentrations of thrombomodulin occurs with a value of kcat/Km = 0.38 μm–1 s–1, which is again higher than the value of 0.22 μm–1 s–1 measured for the human enzyme (35Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cleavage of PAR1 and PAR4 occur with kcat/Km values of 120 and 8.9 μm–1 s–1, which are, respectively, 4- and 26-fold higher than those reported for the human enzyme and exceed those pertaining to the fast form (34Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The preferential cleavage of PAR1 relative to PAR4 is almost 100-fold for the human enzyme but is reduced to 13-fold in murine thrombin. Interestingly, the same preference is retained in the cleavage of human PAR1 and PAR4 by murine thrombin, although the rates are significantly slower than those measured for the murine substrates. On the other hand, cleavage of murine PAR1 and PAR4 by human thrombin occurs with rates comparable with those of the human substrates (Table 1).TABLE 1Values of kcat/Km (in μm–1 s–1) for the hydrolysis of physiologic substrates by wild-type and mutant thrombinsSubstrateHuman WTW215A/E217AMurine WTW215A/E217AFibrinogen17 ± 1 (1.5-31)0.00089 ± 0.0000727 ± 20.023 ± 0.00228 ± 1aHuman substrate.0.0050 ± 0.0002aHuman substrate.PAR130 ± 1 (1.4-53)0.026 ± 0.001120 ± 111.9 ± 0.132 ± 1bMurine substrate.13 ± 1aHuman substrate.3.8 ± 0.2aHuman substrate.PAR40.34 ± 0.01 (0.049-0.58)ND8.9 ± 0.40.014 ± 0.0010.67 ± 0.02bMurine substrate.1.7 ± 0.1aHuman substrate.Protein CcIn the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and 100 nm rabbit thrombomodulin.0.22 ± 0.01 (0.32-0.21)0.033 ± 0.0020.38 ± 0.020.064 ± 0.0040.27 ± 0.01aHuman substrate.0.037 ± 0.002aHuman substrate.RAP128001200a Human substrate.b Murine substrate.c In the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and 100 nm rabbit thrombomodulin. Open table in a new tab In principle, the lack of Na+ effect on murine thrombin could be due to the lack of Na+ binding (Ka = 0 in Equation 1) or to the presence of Na+ binding not linked to transduction of this event into enhanced catalytic activity (s0 = s1 in Equation 1). We favor the first scenario, because mutation of Asp-222 in thrombin abolishes Na+ binding (9Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of the D221A/D222K mutant shows no evidence of bound Na+ (16Pineda A.O. Zhang E. Guinto E.R. Savvides S.N. Tulinsky A. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Factor Xa carries Lys-222-like murine thrombin but is a Na+-activated enzyme (17Monnaie D. Arosio D. Griffon N. Rose T. Rezaie A.R. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5349-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This property, however, is likely due to the different composition of the 186-loop. In fact, Ala mutations in this loop compromise or abrogate Na+ binding in factor Xa (40Rezaie A.R. Kittur F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48262-48269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although they have no such effect in thrombin (11Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13785-13790Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The activity of murine thrombin toward FPF and physiologic substrates is the same or higher than that of the human enzyme, which suggests that murine thrombin is stabilized in a conformation similar to that of the fast form even though it is devoid of Na+ binding. Essentially, murine thrombin has constitutively replaced Na+ activation. This reinforces the importance of Na+ activation in thrombin and proves that an enzyme devoid of Na+ binding and stabilized in the low activity slow form would be incompatible with physiologic function. We propose that the constitutive replacement of Na+ activation in murine thrombin has an important evolutionary advantage. Several mutations of human thrombin, e.g. Frankfurt (41Degen S.J. McDowell S.A. Sparks L.M. Scharrer I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Salakta (42Miyata T. Aruga R. Umeyama H. Bezeaud A. Guillin M.C. Iwanaga S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7457-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), Greenville (43Henriksen R.A. Dunham C.K. Miller L.D. Casey J.T. Menke J.B. Knupp C.L. Usala S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 2026-2031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Scranton (44Sun W.Y. Smirnow D. Jenkins M.L. Degen S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), occur naturally at residues important for Na+ recognition and cause bleeding. It is therefore possible that pressure to constitutively replace Na+ activation arose in the mouse to counter the effect of such mutations or of more disruptive ones. To test this hypothesis, and to complement ongoing transgenic studies by Dr. Jay Degen, we constructed the murine W215A/E217A mutant. The W215A/E217A mutant of human thrombin is the most striking anticoagulant mutant engineered to date; the mutation compromises selectively fibrinogen and PAR1 cleavage but leaves protein C activation in the presence of thrombomodulin almost intact (45Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The anticoagulant effect of the mutation is seen most convincingly in vivo (46Gruber A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Hanson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27581-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and has been explained structurally in terms of the total collapse of the locale for fibrinogen and PAR1 recognition (47Pineda A.O. Chen Z.W. Caccia S. Cantwell A.M. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39824-39828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The murine W215A/E217A mutant has largely (>1,000-fold) compromised fibrinogen cleavage, but the reduction is almost 20-fold less pronounced than in the human variant (Table 1). Cleavage of PAR4 is compromised 600-fold. Notably, cleavage of PAR1 is reduced only 60-fold as opposed to >1,000-fold in the human enzyme. On the other hand, cleavage of protein C is reduced <7-fold, just as for the human variant. Mutation of Trp-215 and Glu-217 affects the activity of murine thrombin toward fibrinogen, PAR1 and PAR4 because these residues make direct contacts with substrate (31Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 33Arosio D. Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E.

Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, unlike the human enzyme, murine thrombin is spared an additional ∼20-fold drop in activity caused by stabilization of the Na+-free slow form upon the Ala replacement of Trp-215 and Glu-217 (9Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because of the constitutive Na+ activation in murine thrombin, the W215A/E217A mutation is significantly less anticoagulant in the mouse than in humans. Murine thrombin lacks Na+ activation, in sharp contrast to the human enzyme. Although the enzyme does not bind Na+, it is locked in a conformation that resembles functionally the fast form of the human enzyme. Molecular mimicry of Na+ activation has general relevance to enzymes activated by monovalent cations, and its elucidation can facilitate the rational engineering of more proficient proteases (3Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1305-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The task is nontrivial, as demonstrated by attempts to mimic Na+ or K+ activation in thrombin (48Roy D.B. Rose T. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 43: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), pyruvate kinase (49Laughlin L.T. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the molecular chaperone Hsc70 (50Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7456-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In all cases the ability of the enzyme to bind and discriminate among monovalent cations was successfully replaced by a Lys side chain. However, in no case was the replacement associated with high catalytic activity. In the case of murine thrombin, the replacement of Asp-222 with Lys and possibly other changes in the 186-loop lining the Na+ pore (Fig. 4) resulted in efficient mimicry of Na+ activation and full catalytic activity toward physiologic substrates. There is an evolutionary advantage to constitutively replacing Na+ activation for optimal catalytic activity if pressure exists to mutate residues important for Na+ binding. Evidence has been presented that the evolutionary divergence of serine proteases can be explained fully in terms of the C-terminal sequence of the catalytic domain (51Krem M.M. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28063-28066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This is the sequence in which pressure to mutate is the highest and, coincidentally, where all residues important for Na+ binding are located. It is therefore possible that murine thrombin endorses molecular mimicry of Na+ activation to counter the effect of mutations affecting Na+ binding that would compromise the ability to cleave fibrinogen or the PARs. Murine thrombin cleaves fibrinogen and protein C with rate constants comparable with those of the human enzyme-substrate interactions, but important differences have emerged from the results on PAR1 and PAR4. PAR1 is responsible for platelet activation in humans at low thrombin concentrations, and its action is reinforced by PAR4 at higher concentrations of enzyme (19Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). In the mouse, signaling in platelets is mediated entirely by PAR4, with PAR3 facilitating PAR4 cleavage at low thrombin concentrations (52Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S. Farese Jr., R.V. Tam C. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 53Nakanishi-Matsui M. Zheng Y.W. Sulciner D.J. Weiss E.J. Ludeman M.J. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). PAR1 is by far the best physiologic substrate for murine thrombin, its kcat/Km being almost 6-fold higher than that of fibrinogen and 4-fold higher than the analogous interaction in humans. PAR4 has a kcat/Km 13-fold lower than that of PAR1 in the mouse, which contrasts the 100-fold preference of PAR1 versus PAR4 seen in the human enzyme. This is because the thrombin-PAR4 interaction is 26-fold more specific in the mouse than human. These findings are consistent with PAR4 being the major signaling pathway in mouse platelets (19Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 54Brass L.F. Chest. 2003; 124: 18S-25SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The relatively low kcat/Km for PAR4 cleavage by human thrombin explains the ancillary role of this receptor in human platelet activation that is mostly dependent on PAR1 (19Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 54Brass L.F. Chest. 2003; 124: 18S-25SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A value of kcat/Km for thrombin-PAR4 interaction in the mouse similar to that seen in humans would be incompatible with the physiologic requirements of platelet activation. That is presumably the reason why the thrombin-PAR4 interaction in the mouse occurs with a kcat/Km value similar to that of the thrombin-PAR1 interaction in humans. A potentially important property of murine thrombin, also shared by human thrombin, is the ability to cleave chymotrypsin-specific substrates such as FPF. Although thrombin closely resembles trypsin in its three-dimensional architecture, it differs significantly in the accessibility and hydrophobicity of the S1 pocket. Heparin cofactor II carries Leu-444 in the P1 position, which penetrates the S1 pocket of thrombin and effectively inactivates the enzyme, although the L444R substitution produces more potent inhibition (55Derechin V.M. Blinder M.A. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5623-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Ciaccia A.V. Willemze A.J. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 888-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The S1 pocket of factor Xa can also accept hydrophobic residues (57Chuang Y.J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), consistent with the data reported in Fig. 2. Medicinal chemists have long recognized that the S1 pocket of thrombin is wider than that of trypsin and can accommodate bulky hydrophobic groups (58De Simone G. Menchise V. Omaggio S. Pedone C. Scozzafava A. Supuran C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9013-9021Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 59Malikayil J.A. Burkhart J.P. Schreuder H.A. Broersma Jr., R.J. Tardif C. Kutcher III, L.W. Mehdi S. Schatzman G.L. Neises B. Peet N.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a feature that has been exploited to achieve selective inhibition of thrombin over trypsin (60Chen Z. Li Y. Mulichak A.M. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 61Lee S.L. Alexander R.S. Smallwood A. Trievel R. Mersinger L. Weber P.C. Kettner C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13180-13186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, a crystal structure of thrombin complexed with a synthetic inhibitor has documented the mode of interaction of a Tyr side chain within the primary specificity pocket (62Riester D. Wirsching F. Salinas G. Keller M. Gebinoga M. Kamphausen S. Merkwirth C. Goetz R. Wiesenfeldt M. Sturzebecher J. Bode W. Friedrich R. Thurk M. Schwienhorst A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8597-8602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl group of Tyr engages the carboxylate of Asp-189 in favorable polar interactions that are both direct and mediated by a water molecule. Hence, thrombin possesses the necessary structural requisites to effectively cleave substrates carrying Phe or Tyr at P1. The physiologic importance of this dual trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like specificity of murine and human thrombin is presently unclear and requires further investigation. The preference of thrombin for P1 residues may be influenced by cofactors or by interaction with membranes or extracellular matrix components, which opens up the possibility that the environment in which thrombin acts may change the repertoire of substrates available for cleavage and may include targets that remain to be identified. We are grateful to Dr. Jay Degen for providing the PCDNA3 vector and for sharing valuable information on his ongoing studies with the W215A/E217A mouse transgene."
https://openalex.org/W2088852089,"By using Western blot analysis, high levels of 17.5- and 20-kDa interleukin-1β (IL-1β) proteins were detected in the submandibular gland (SMG) of mice. Despite this fact, the amount of pro-IL-1β protein, a precursor of IL-1β, with a molecular size of 35 kDa in this tissue was below the detectable level, although strong expression of pro-IL-1β mRNA was observed. A large amount of 17.5-kDa IL-1β also appeared in the saliva of mice injected with lipopolysaccharide, suggesting that this IL-1β is a secretory form produced by the SMG. The protein for IL-1β-converting enzyme, a processing enzyme for pro-IL-1β, was expressed only at a low level in the SMG as compared with its level in various epithelial tissues or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. On the other hand, mK1, mK9, mK13, and mK22, members of the kallikrein family, were detected strongly in the SMG but not in other tissues. By incubation with mK13, but not with mK1, mK9, or mK22, the 35-kDa pro-IL-1β was cleaved into two major products with molecular masses of 17.5 and 22 kDa, and production was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a serine protease inhibitor, but not by IL-1β-converting enzyme inhibitors. A peptide segment corresponding to amino acid residues 107–121 of mouse pro-IL-1β (107WDDDDNLLVCDVPIR) was cleaved by incubation with mK13, generating two peptides, 107WDDDDNL and 114LVCDVPIR. Therefore, kallikrein mK13 would appear to hydrolyze pro-IL-1β between its Leu113and Leu114 residues. The results of immunohistochemistry and an autonomic therapy experiment showed that IL-1β and kallikrein mK13 were co-localized in the secretory granules of granular convoluted tubular cells. Our present results thus suggest kallikrein mK13 is a plausible candidate for the processing enzyme for pro-IL-1β in the SMG of mice.

Both directly and indirectly, IL-1 plays a role in the activation of T cells and hematopoietic stem cells, the induction of fever and acute-phase proteins, the degradation of cartilage, and the healing of wounds. Two biochemically distinct but structurally related IL-1 molecules have been cloned, IL-1α (1Auron P.E. Webb A.C. Rosenwasser L.J. Mucci S.F. Rich A. Wolff S.M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nature. 1984; 312: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). IL-1α and IL-1β have similar but not identical multiple biological effects, which have been well characterized by in vivo and in vitro experiments (3Dinarello C.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 4Oppenheim J. Kovacs E. Matsushima K. Durum S. Immunol. Today. 1986; 7: 45-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Both forms of IL-1 are synthesized by a wide variety of tissues and affect almost all types of cells, which share a common receptor. These cells are keratinocytes, lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, and others. Each IL-1 is encoded by a separate gene, both of which are located on chromosome 2; and each gene contains seven exons. Their initial protein products are pro-IL-1s of large molecular weight. When mRNAs for these precursor cytokines are translated in vitro, only the IL-1α precursor (actually pro-IL-1α) is active (5March C.J. Mosley B. Larsen A. Cerretti D.P. Braedt G. Price V. Gillis S. Henney C.S. Kronheim S.R. Grabstein K. Conclon P.J. Hopp T.P. Cosman D. Nature. 1985; 315: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar) and binds to the IL-1 receptor (6Mosley B. Urdal D.L.

Removal of the NH2-terminal half of the IL-1β precursor (pro-IL-1β) is essential for the biological activity of this form, suggesting the involvement of a processing step. Thus pro-IL-1β is a 35-kDa protein synthesized from IL-1β mRNA and is an inactive precursor without a conventional signal sequence. It is cleaved to generate the 17.5-kDa bioactive, secreted form of the cytokine (7Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Merriam J.E. March C.J. Hopp T.P. J. Biol.

One of the enzymes responsible for the generation of 17.5-kDa IL-1β is IL-1β-converting enzyme (ICE), a cytoplasmic cysteine protease characterized after isolation from cells of monocytic origin and shown to have the ability to process pro-IL-1β to generate the active inflammatory cytokine IL-1β (9Cerretti D.P.

On the other hand, the kallikreins are a group of serine proteases that are found in diverse tissues and biological fluids, and they are now divided into two major categories, plasma kallikreins and tissue kallikreins. The function of plasma kallikreins includes their participation in the process of blood clotting and fibrinolysis and in the regulation of vascular tone and inflammation reactions through the release of bradykinin (11Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue kallikreins were originally characterized by their ability to generate kallidin or bradykinin from kininogens (12Schachter M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1979; 31: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). They are expressed in the glandular tissues such as the salivary glands and pancreas as well as in the kidney and other tissues. Tissue kallikreins are also involved in the processing of growth factor precursors (13Berg T. Bradshaw R.A. Carretero O.A. Chao J. Chao L. Clements J.A. Fahnestock M. Fritz H. Gauthier F. Macdonald R.J. Margolius H.S. Morris B.J. Richards R.I. Scicli A.G. Agents Action Suppl. 1992; 38: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar), activation of other kallikreins in the family, or in the hydrolysis of gel-forming proteins such as semenogelin and fibronectin (14Yousef G.M. Diamandis E.P. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 184-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). There are many tissue kallikrein enzymes, and their genes make up a large family, the tissue kallikrein gene family (15Mason A.J. Evans B.A. Cox D.R. Shine J. Richards R.I. Nature. 1983; 303: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Yousef G.M. Chang A. Scorilas A. Diamandis E.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). All of these genes code for putative serine proteases and share important similarities, including the same chromosome mapping, significant homology at both the nucleotide and protein level, and similar genomic organization. Four members of the tissue kallikrein family, mK1, mK9, mK13, and mK22, are found in the mouse submandibular gland (SMG). We recently found that the 17.5-kDa form of IL-1β was present in the SMG (17Yao C. Li X. Kwartarini M. Kosugi-Tanaka C. Akamatsu T. Kanamori N. Hosoi K. Immunology. 2005; 116: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and secreted into the saliva. In this study, we demonstrate that one of the kallikreins, mK13, also known as pro-renin-converting enzyme, is also able to process pro-IL-1β to form 17.5-kDa IL-1β. Reagents—Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli (serotype 0111:B4), thioglycollate medium, and TRI Reagent™ were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant mouse IL-1β and goat anti-recombinant mouse IL-1β (IgG, Western blotting) were products of Peprotech EC (London, UK) and Genzyme-Techne (Cambridge, MA), respectively. RPMI 1640 medium was from Invitrogen. Goat polyclonal antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of mouse IL-1β (including the blocking peptide; for immunohistochemistry), rabbit anti-ICE polyclonal antibody (specific for the p10 subunit and 45-kDa precursor of caspase-1), and the blocking peptide, donkey anti-goat IgG (H + L) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) FITC, donkey anti-goat IgG-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and donkey anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Superscript One-step RT-PCR kit was obtained from Invitrogen, and NuSieve and SeaKem agarose came from Cambrex BioScience (Rockland, ME). ELISA kit was obtained from BIOSOURCE. Caspase-1 inhibitor I (acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CHO) and caspase-1 inhibitor VIII (Ac-Trp-Glu-His-Asp-CHO) were purchased from Calbiochem. Active recombinant mouse caspase-1 was procured from BioVision (Mountain View, CA). A Historesin Plus kit came from Leica Microsystems (Heidelberg, Germany); and a Bio-Rad protein assay kit was from Bio-Rad. An ECL detection kit was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. A peptide segment of pro-IL-1β (107WDDDDNLLVCDVPIR) was custom-synthesized and procured from NeoMPS, Inc. (San Diego). Preparation of the Four Major Tissue Kallikreins from the SMG of Mice—The tissue kallikreins mK9, mK13, and mK22 were prepared from the SMG of adult male mice, whereas mK1 was obtained from the same gland of female mice (18Hosoi K.

Acta. 1983; 756: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The purification steps included acid treatment, acetone fractionation, isoelectric focusing, and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, as described previously (20Hosoi K. Tsunasawa S. Kurihara K. Aoyama H. Ueha T. Murai T. Sakiyama F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Each enzyme was identified by analysis of its complete or partial amino acid sequence. The activity of each purified enzyme for hydrolysis of benzoylarginine ethyl ester at 20 °C was 162, 271, 180, and 805 units/mg protein for mK1, mK9, mK13, and mK22, respectively, and these values indicated that the purified enzymes were fully active (18Hosoi K.

Acta. 1983; 756: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The purity of each enzyme was appreciable, as judged from electrophoresis data and protein sequence analysis. Preparation of Anti-tissue Kallikrein Antiserum with Restricted Immunoreactivity—Antisera for tissue kallikreins were raised in rabbits by a standard procedure. Because the enzymes of the tissue kallikrein family are highly homologous to each other, these antisera needed to be pre-absorbed with other major SMG kallikreins to eliminate their cross-reactivity and enhance their specificity. Following the procedure reported previously (21Kurabuchi S. Tada J. Gresik E.W. Hosoi K. Histochem. J. 1999; 31: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), a mixture of anti-mK1 antiserum and cross-reactive kallikreins (10 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-mK1 antiserum, 10 μl each of mK9, mK13, and mK22 (all 0.2 μg/μl), and 60 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was rocked at 4 °C overnight to prepare the specific anti-mK1 antiserum. The antisera against mK9, mK13, and mK22 were similarly treated. All of these antisera are designated as “mK-specific antiserum” in this paper. For a control experiment, each specific antiserum was further absorbed with its antigen, e.g. the mK1-specific antiserum (10 μl) was mixed with mK1 (18 μg) in 100 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then rocked at 4 °C overnight. The specific antisera against mK9, mK13, and mK22 were also similarly treated. Each of these control antisera is hereafter designated as “pre-absorbed anti-mK antiserum.” Preparation of Extract Containing Pro-IL-1β from Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages—Mice were killed by cervical dislocation on day 3 after the intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of sterile thioglycollate medium, and their peritoneal cavity was then lavaged with 8 ml of Hanks' buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 200 units/ml penicillin G, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin). The recovered lavage fluid was pooled, and the peritoneal cells in it were collected by centrifugation (200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated in 100 mm-dishes (cells from 1 mouse per 1 dish). The macrophages were allowed to adhere for at least 2 h by incubating them at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, after which the dishes were washed with fresh medium to remove the unattached cells. The cells were then cultured overnight. Next the cells in culture were primed with 1 μg/ml of LPS for 2 h and then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove any nonadherent cells and the fetal bovine serum. The adherent cells were scraped off the plates and mixed with lysis buffer (1 ml of lysis buffer/dish) consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The lysates were placed on ice, sonicated, and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction was recovered and stored at -84 °C. Animals, Treatments with Endotoxin, and Autonomic Agents—Male C3H/HeN mice 7–8 weeks old were purchased from Nippon SLC (Shizuoka, Japan) and housed under standard conditions (12-h light/12-h darkness cycle at 22–25 °C) with free access to food and water. All animals were sacrificed for experiments at the age of 8–9 weeks. For endotoxin experiments, LPS dissolved in saline at 1 mg/ml and stored at -84 °C was used. It was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 μg/mouse. For experiments using autonomic agents, 8-week-old male mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and injected intraperitoneally with normal saline or autonomic agents (pilocarpine, isoproterenol, or phenylephrine), each at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The saliva was collected, and the SMG were immediately excised as described below. Preparation of Tissue Extracts and Collection of Saliva—From normal mice or mice injected with LPS or various autonomic reagents, the saliva was collected; and various tissues were isolated, including SMG, parotid gland (PG), lung, spleen, liver, kidney, and stomach. The saliva from LPS-stimulated mice was collected for 30 min at 6 h after injection of LPS (10 μg/mouse, intraperitoneally) by means of the cotton pellet procedure described previously (17Yao C. Li X. Kwartarini M. Kosugi-Tanaka C. Akamatsu T. Kanamori N. Hosoi K. Immunology. 2005; 116: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). From mice injected with autonomic agents, the saliva was collected for 60 min immediately after injection. The collected saliva was treated with 5% acetic acid. The tissues were homogenized in 9 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 tablet of Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture per 25 ml of the buffer) by using a glass mortar homogenizer fitted with a Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The saliva and tissue extracts thus prepared were stored at -84 °C until used in experiments. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—For analysis of kallikreins and ICE, 10-μg aliquots of the homogenate from the SMG, PG, lung, spleen, liver, and kidney or 10 μl of saliva and macrophage extracts were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and denatured by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. For IL-1β analysis, the same amount of samples mixed with the sampling buffer was incubated at 40 °C for 1 h. All samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was soaked in transfer buffer for several minutes, and the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter by means of a Mini Trans Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) following the standard procedure. The filters were blocked at room temperature for 2 h with 3% horse serum (for analysis of IL-1β and ICE) or with 3% dry milk (for kallikrein analysis) in 0.2% T-TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.2% Tween 20). They were next incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies diluted in their respective blocking buffer. The following primary antibodies were used: goat (IgG) anti-recombinant mouse IL-1β (0.1 μg/ml; Genzyme-Techne); polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse ICE (1/1000); rabbit polyclonal mK1-, mK9-, and mK13-specific antisera (1/25,000); and rabbit polyclonal mK22-specific antiserum (1/10,000). For control reactions, the filter was incubated with the same concentration of antibody/antiserum pre-absorbed with the respective antigen used for immunization. Filters were washed with 0.2% T-TBS, incubated with 3000 times diluted donkey anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (for IL-1β analysis) or with 3000 times diluted donkey anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (for ICE and kallikrein analysis), and washed with 0.2% T-TBS. Finally the filters were reacted with ECL and exposed to an x-ray film for the appropriate time. Analysis of mRNA Expression by RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the SMG and LPS-stimulated macrophages by using Tri-Reagent™. RT-PCR was performed following the standard protocols described previously (17Yao C. Li X. Kwartarini M. Kosugi-Tanaka C. Akamatsu T. Kanamori N. Hosoi K. Immunology. 2005; 116: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) by using a Superscript One-step RT-PCR kit. The amplification of mRNAs for IL-1β and β-actin consisted of RT reaction by incubation at 45 °C for 30 min, denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, and PCR amplification. PCR amplifications after the RT reaction were set as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for either 35 (IL-1β) or 22 cycles (β-actin). At the end of each PCR, an extra extension at 72 °C for 5 min was performed. A control PCR without the RT reaction step was run for each pair of primers by using total RNA to ensure no amplification of genomic DNA. RT-PCR without RNA was also conducted as another negative control. These reactions were sequentially conducted in a Takara PCR Thermal Cycler MP, model TP3000 (Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 3% agarose gel (NuSieve, SeaKem = 3/1) following the standard procedure. A mouse pro-IL-1β cDNA (nucleotides 71–776 of GenBank™/NCBI Data Bank accession number M15131) was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA by using the following primer set, 5′-AGCAGCTATGGCAACTGTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCTGCAGACTCAAACTCCAC-3′ (antisense). Similarly, a mouse β-actin cDNA (nucleotides 1–1892 of GenBank™ /NCBI Data Bank accession number NM007393) was amplified by using 5′-ACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGAACCGCTCGTTGCC-3′ (antisense) as the primers. Restricted Hydrolysis of Pro-IL-1β and Its Peptide Segment by Tissue Kallikreins—Ten-microliter extracts from LPS-stimulated macrophages containing 15 μg of total protein and pro-IL-1β were incubated with various concentrations of tissue kallikrein family enzymes (0.006–0.6 μg)at37°Cfor 1 h in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The incubation was terminated by adding 20 μl of 2× SDS sampling buffer and was followed by another incubation at 40 °C for 1 h. The hydrolytic products were then analyzed by immunoblotting. Similarly, for the time course study, 0.02 μg of mK13 was mixed with 5 μl of extract of LPS-stimulated macrophage, which contained 43.3 fmol of pro-IL-1β. The reaction mixture (20 μl) was incubated at 37 °C for 0, 0.5, or 1–3 h. To examine the effect of inhibitors of ICE and mK13, we mixed the enzyme (1.5 μg/ml mK13 or 50 units/ml ICE) with the inhibitors and preincubated the mixture at room temperature for 30 min (final volume, 10 μl). Ten microliters of the extract of LPS-stimulated macrophage was then added to the mixture, which was subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Thereafter, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 2× SDS sampling buffer. For determination of the amount of IL-1β formed, the band intensity was quantified by using NIH Image software. To determine the exact position of hydrolysis of pro-IL-1β by tissue kallikreins, we mixed 20 μg of a peptide segment corresponding to amino acid residues 107–121 of mouse pro-IL-1β (107WDDDDNLLVCDVPIR) with 1 μg of kallikrein mK13 in a 100-μl reaction mixture and incubated it at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the precipitated protein was then removed by centrifugation. The supernatant obtained was subjected to HPLC analysis. Namely, the sample was applied to a CrestPak C18S reverse phase-HPLC column (inner diameter 4.6 × 150 mm; Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and the column was eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (10–60%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 1 ml/min. The peptide peaks that appeared were collected and dried. Their sequences were analyzed by a protein sequencer, Model PPSQ-10, Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan). Detection of IL-1β by ELISA—Levels of IL-1β in the lysate of LPS-stimulated macrophage, saliva, and SMG of normal mice were assessed by ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol. The minimal detection level was ≤7 pg/ml, and the assay was specific for mouse IL-1β. Immunohistochemistry—For IL-1β immunostaining, SMGs were fixed and embedded as described (17Yao C. Li X. Kwartarini M. Kosugi-Tanaka C. Akamatsu T. Kanamori N. Hosoi K. Immunology. 2005; 116: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For staining of kallikrein mK13, mice were anesthetized, and a fixative (3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm Na-Pi buffer, pH 7.4) was circulated throughout the body for 5 min by injection via the left ventricle. The SMGs were dissected and immersed in the same fixative at 4 °C for 2 h. The fixed tissue was washed at 4 °C overnight in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 6.8% sucrose. These samples were dehydrated in 100% acetone at 4 °C for 1 h, and subsequently embedded in Historesin Plus by following the manufacturer's protocol. Sections of 2 μm thickness were cut and mounted on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slides. They were dried at 37 °C for 2 h and stored at -20 °C until used for immunostaining. For staining of kallikrein mK13, the tissue sections described above were washed in PBS and incubated in 0.05% trypsin in PBS for 10 min to expose the antigen epitope. Next they were blocked by incubation with 5% normal goat serum, washed three times with PBS, for 5 min each time, and then incubated with 25,000 times diluted mK13-specific antiserum at 4 °C overnight. After being washed three times with PBS, the sections were reacted with 200 times diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) FITC and washed with PBS. For IL-1β staining, the sections were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum and incubated with 0.2 μg/ml goat anti-IL-1β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. The sections were next reacted with donkey anti-goat IgG (H + L) FITC. For control staining, sections were incubated with pre-absorbed anti-mK13 antiserum. All sections were next incubated for 15 min at room temperature with PBS containing 0.1 μg/ml propidium iodide and 20 μg/ml RNase A and then washed with PBS to allow the nucleus to become stained. These stained sections were examined under a fluorescence microscope equipped with a DXM 1200 digital camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Expression of 17.5- and 20-kDa IL-1β in Mouse Tissue—Fig. 1 shows the tissue distribution of mouse IL-1β as revealed by Western blotting using anti-IL-1β antibody (Genzyme-Techne). This antibody strongly detected 17.5- and 20-kDa bands of IL-1β in the SMG, which are the same size as active/secretory forms of this cytokine (22Beuscher H.U. Gunther C. Rollinghoff M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2179-2183PubMed Google Scholar, 23Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Cantrell M. Deeley M.C. March C.J. Prickett K.S. Wignall J. Conlon P.J. Cosman D. Hopp T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus suggesting that they were produced from pro-IL-1β in this tissue. These smaller sizes of the IL-1β bands were not detected in tissues other than the SMG. A result similar to that for the SMG was obtained in the experiment in which a saliva sample from LPS-injected mice was assessed (Fig. 1A), again supporting the idea that 17.5- and 20-kDa bands would be secreted from the SMG after having been processed from their precursors. On the other hand, a strong 35-kDa band and a less intense 28-kDa band were found in the lane containing the extract from LPS-stimulated macrophages, as reported previously (24Brough D. Le Feuvre R.A. Wheeler R.D. Solovyova N. Hilfiker S. Rothwell N.J. Verkhratsky A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3029-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An IL-1β immunoreactive band showing a molecular mass of 35 kDa was also seen in the case of lung and spleen, although the level was low; but no such band was detected in the lane containing the SMG extract. All these bands were specific, and they disappeared by pre-absorption of the antibody with the recombinant IL-1β (Fig. 1B). These data were confirmed by ELISA, in which the relative level of IL-1β in each tissue gave roughly parallel values (Table 1). Furthermore, the pro-IL-1β mRNA was detected at high levels not only in the LPS-stimulated macrophages but also in the SMG by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2). Because the active form of IL-1β is known to be produced from pro-IL-1β by protein processing (7Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Merriam J.E. March C.J. Hopp T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5323-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kostura M.J. Tocci M.J. Limjuco G. Chin J. Cameron P. Hillman A.G. Chartrain N.A. Schmidt J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5227-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the pro-IL-1β protein produced in the SMG was immediately processed to give 17.5- and 20-kDa IL-1β.TABLE 1ELISA of pro-IL-1β and/or IL-1β in various mouse tissues Tissue extracts were subjected to ELISA after 100–1000 times dilution. The A450 nm value of a standard curve of the present assay gave 0.336–1.493 corresponding to 0–1000 pg/ml recombinant IL-1β. The A450 nm value of diluted samples ranged between 0.479 and 0.665, values of which were comput"

Although loss of TGF-β receptor levels is strongly selected for during the progression of most cancers, tumor cells frequently escape from complete loss of TGF-β receptors through unknown mechanisms. Here, we provide the first evidence that epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, which is generally enhanced in cancer, is permissive for regulation of gene expression and growth suppression by TGF-β in LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. Our results support that these permissive effects occur through enhanced stability of TβRII mRNA and reversal of TGF-β-mediated TβRII mRNA loss. Changes in stability of TβRII mRNA occur soon after EGF or TGF-β1 addition (optimal within 3 h) and are independent of de novo protein synthesis or transcription. Remarkably, such loss of TβRII by TGF-β can be mediated by a kinase-dead TβRII (K277R), as well as by other forms of this receptor harboring mutations at prominent autophosphorylation sites. Moreover, Smad3 small interfering RNA, which blocks TGF-β-induced AP-1 promoter activity, does not block changes in the expression of TβRII by EGF or TGF-β. We have also shown that changes in TβRII levels by EGF are EGF receptor-kinase-dependent and are controlled by signals downstream of MEK1/2. Our findings provide invaluable insights on the role of the EGF receptor-kinase in enhancing TGF-β responses during prostate carcinogenesis.

As one of the earliest events in the cellular responses to these multifunctional growth factors, TβRI and TβRII cell surface signaling receptors form a heterotetrameric complex upon binding TGF-βs (10Moustakas A.

The constituitively active kinase domain of TβRII activates TβRI by transphosphorylation of the GS box in the cytoplasmic domain (13Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The activated TβRI then propagates TGF-β signals partly by activating Smads 2 and 3 by phosphorylating their C-terminal serines (14Wrana J.L.

These Smads then translocate to the nucleus where they function either directly as transcription factors or indirectly as transcription co-modulators (16Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

TGF-β receptors are mutated or/and expressed at substantially reduced levels in a variety of human cancers including colon, gastric, and prostate cancers, correlating with acquisition of resistance to growth suppression by TGF-β (19Kim I.Y.

Significantly, restoration of TGF-β receptor expression or function can reverse the malignant phenotype in a variety of carcinoma cells (3Guo Y. Kyprianou N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1366-1371PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chang J. Park K. Bang Y.J. Kim W.S. Kim D. Kim S.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2856-2859PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with those observations, suppression of TGF-β signaling by dominant-negative TβRII has been shown to promote malignant transformation of non-tumorigenic cell lines (4Tang B. de Castro K. Barnes H.E. Parks W.T. Stewart L. Bottinger E.P. Danielpour D. Wakefield L.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4834-4842PubMed Google Scholar, 6Song K. Cornelius S.C. Danielpour D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4358-4367PubMed Google Scholar).Despite the apparent selective pressure for carcinomas to lose TGF-β receptors, there appears to be resistance against complete loss of those receptors during the progression of many carcinomas (24Piek E. Roberts A.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 83: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), consistent with the conversion of the function of TGF-β to that of an oncogene (25Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8621-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular mechanism behind the switch of the function of TGF-β from tumor suppressor to tumor promoter is likely to require a signal for the retention of TGF-β receptors during carcinogenesis.EGF is a 6-kDa polypeptide that binds to a 170-kDa transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor (EGFR) expressed on a wide variety of normal and neoplastic cells. Binding of EGF to EGFR causes receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, leading to activation of a number of downstream signal transduction pathways, such as Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI3-kinase/Akt, that mediate cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis by EGF (26Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Although EGFR appears to be amplified and activated in many cancers, its role in the malignant phenotype is not entirely clear (27Arteaga C. Semin. Oncol. 2003; 30: 3-14Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In most cells EGF is growth stimulatory and anti-apoptotic; however, a number of tumor cell lines have been shown to be killed by this peptide through unknown mechanisms (28Fombonne J. Reix S. Rasolonjanahary R. Danty E. Thirion S. Laforge-Anglade G. Bosler O. Mehlen P. Enjalbert A. Krantic S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4938-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Chen K.Y.

Although seemingly counterintuitive, the activation of TGF-β responses by EGF is consistent with the general induction of TGF-β ligand by this mitogen (35Danielpour D. Kim K.Y. Winokur T.S.

In all time course experiments, the times of EGF or TGF-β addition were varied, with total culture times and all other conditions kept constant for proper control. Vehicles used as controls for TGF-β1 and EGF (4 mm HCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, diluted 1000-fold in assay) were shown to have no effect on TβRII level at all treatment times.TGF-β Sandwich Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—TGF-β proteins were measured by established sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (43Danielpour D.

Serum-free conditions were used for the preparation of conditioned medium to avoid carryover of latent TGF-βs in serum (43Danielpour D. Kim K.Y. Dart L.L. Watanabe S. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1989; 2: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Following either 24 or 48 h of conditioning, medium was assayed for TGF-β. Daily production rates of TGF-β were normalized to the DNA content of producer cells (42Chipuk J.E. Cornelius S.C. Pultz N.J. Jorgensen J.S. Bonham M.J. Kim S.J. Danielpour D. J. Biol.

A 19-mer scrambled siRNA pair without a known human mRNA target was used as a negative control. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after siRNA transfection.Adenovirus Gene Delivery—An adenovirus vector that directs the expression of WT-TβRII (AdMax-WT-TβRII) was constructed using the AdMax system (Microbix Biosystems). The full-length coding sequence of human TβRII (1.7 kb) excised from pCMV5-HA-TβRII (45Kim I.Y. Zelner D.J. Lee C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pDC515 adenovirus shuttle vector. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of pDC515-HA-TβRII and 1 μg of genomic vector pBHGfrtDE1,3FLP in 6-well plates, using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (42Chipuk J.E.

Following transfection, the cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 containing 2% FBS for ∼10 days or until the appearance of viral cytopathic effects. Cells were then lysed by four serial freeze-thaw cycles (on dry ice and 37 °C). Liberated viral particles were further amplified by two-three serial infections through human embryonic kidney 293 cells, according to the manufacturer's protocol. To titer total viral particles, aliquots of virus stocks were diluted 20-fold in lysis solution (0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA) and incubated for 10 min at 56 °C. The optical density of the samples at 260 nm was used to calculate virus content using the relationship 1.1 × 1012 virus particles/ml/A260 units. All viral preparations were evaluated for expression of recombinant protein by Western blot analysis of transduced NRP-154 and LNCaP cells.For experiments involving use of adenovirus, LNCaP cells were infected overnight with 1.0–2.5 × 1010 viral particles/2 ml/well (in 6-well dishes). Their medium was then replaced to remove residual virus particles before treatment with the indicated factors.Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed essentially as described (46Song K.

In brief, 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed and equal loading and even transfer were assessed by visualization of the 18 and 28 S rRNAs. The presence of indicated mRNA was detected with cDNA probes labeled with [32P]dCTP using PrimeIt® RmT random primer labeling kit (Stratagene).RT-PCR—RT was performed as described (6Song K. Cornelius S.C. Danielpour D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4358-4367PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR primers applied to detect TβRII expression were 5′-AGCACGATCCCACCGCACGTTCAGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTATTTGGTAGTGTTTAGGGAGCCGT-3′ (reverse) and yielded a 1.7-kb fragment. Taq polymerase master mix (Promega) was used for PCR amplification of TβRII from 0.1 μg of LNCaP cDNA template, using 32 cycles of the following temperature gradients: 95 °C for 15 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. β-Actin, amplified as above for 21 cycles, served as an internal control.Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described (6Song K.

Cells were lysed in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm β-glycerophosphate. The resulting lysates were clarified in 1.5-ml tubes by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were quantified by a microtiter BCA protein assay (Pierce) as described before (46Song K.

For determination of TβRII levels, aliquots of 10–20 μg (protein) were deglycosylated by incubation with peptide-N-glycosidase F according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs).Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—All of these procedures were performed essentially as described (42Chipuk J.E.

In brief, LNCaP cells were plated overnight at a density of 1.25 × 105 cells/1 ml/well in 12-well plates. Reporter constructs, 1–2μg, were co-transfected with 12.5–25 ng of CMV-Renilla reporter construct using Lipofectamine-Plus™ followed by treatment with EGF (20 ng/ml) and TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). Luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a ML3000 microtiter plate luminometer. All luciferase activity was expressed as normalized values of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase.RESULTSEGF Permits TGF-β1 Autoinduction and Growth Suppression in LNCaP Cells—Major interest in the role of TGF-β in the prostate is attributed to the ability of this cytokine to induce cell death, suppress tumor growth, and likely mediate androgen ablation-induced cell death (49Kyprianou N. Isaacs J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 50Lucia M.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Stewart L.V. Danielpour D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We used the LNCaP cell line, which expresses low to undetectable levels of TGF-β ligands and receptors, to identify factors that may suppress tumor growth by their ability to up-regulate TGF-β ligands or receptors. We first screened a variety of growth factors and hormones for their ability to enhance expression of TGF-β ligands in these cells under serum-free conditions. Of these, only EGF was able to enhance the expression of TGF-β1 to a level detectable by the most sensitive and specific TGF-β sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays reported (43Danielpour D. Kim K.Y. Dart L.L. Watanabe S. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1989; 2: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Following a secondary screen of factors that could synergize with EGF to enhance TGF-β1 expression, we found that only TGF-β ligands (TGF-βs 1, 2, or 3) elevated TGF-β1 expression in the presence of EGF (42Chipuk J.E. Cornelius S.C. Pultz N.J. Jorgensen J.S. Bonham M.J. Kim S.J. Danielpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1240-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We now show that EGF is clearly permissive for the autoinduction of TGF-β1 expression as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1A) and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1, B and C). Use of TGF-β2 treatment rather than TGF-β1 confirmed that changes in TGF-β1 protein levels measured in conditioned medium reflected only that made by LNCaP cells.The AP-1 complex (commonly composed of dimers of c-Jun and c-Fos, or JunD/Fra-2) and Egr-1 have been shown to mediate TGF-β1 autoinduction by activating its transcription (51Kim S.J. Angel P. Lafyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Dey B.R. Sukhatme V.P. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Rauscher F.J. II I Kim S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, to understand how EGF permits autoinduction of TGF-β1 in LNCaP cells, we studied the individual and combined effects of TGF-β1 and EGF on c-Fos, c-Jun, Egr-1, and EGFR mRNA expression. Co-treatment of these cells with TGF-β1 and EGF induced c-Fos and Egr-1 mRNA levels, which peaked by 48 h. At this time point, EGF alone induced expression of both these mRNAs. In contrast, TGF-β1 alone (without EGF) was ineffective in modulating these transcription factors. However, TGF-β1 was able to induce the expression of both these mRNAs when this cell line was treated together with EGF (Fig. 1D). Neither TGF-β1 nor EGF added alone or together enhanced the mRNA levels of c-Jun or EGFR. These results show that EGF is permissive not only for TGF-β1 autoinduction but also for TGF-β's induction of c-Fos and Egr-1.We next performed a cell growth assay to examine whether the permissive effect of EGF also occurred at the level of growth inhibition by TGF-β1. LNCaP cells, plated in DMEM/F12 containing 10% DC-FBS to sustain cell proliferation, were pretreated with or without EGF for 24 h prior to TGF-β1 addition. Cell numbers were determined at days 3, 6, 9, and 12 following the treatment of TGF-β1. Cells cultured with TGF-β1 alone were growth arrested relative to controls that showed a slight increase in proliferation. However, when pretreated with EGF, TGF-β1 promoted death of LNCaP cells, whereas EGF alone actually stimulated growth (Fig. 2). Thus, in LNCaP cells EGF enhances the ability of TGF-β to suppress growth arrest and appears to be permissive to TGF-β-induced cell death/apoptosis.FIGURE 2EGF enhances the ability of TGF-β1 to inhibit growth or induce death of LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells (5 × 104 cells/well/1.0 ml of DMEM/F12 + 10% DC-FBS) were plated in 12-well dishes, treated with EGF (20 ng/ml) or vehicle, and 24 h later treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle. Cell numbers were assayed 3, 6, 9, and 12 days later using a Coulter Electronics counter. Data shown are averages (±S.D.) of triplicate independent measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Endogenous TβRII mRNA Is Enhanced by EGF through a Non-transcriptional Mechanism—To define the mechanism by which EGF can permit TGF-β1 responses we next studied the effects of EGF on TGF-β-regulated transcriptional activity, using a highly TGF-β-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct, 3TP-lux. We showed that neither TGF-β1 nor EGF alone activated 3TP-lux, whereas co-treatment with both of these agents induced this promoter activity ∼7-fold (Fig. 3A). Consistent with a TGF-β receptor-mediated response, this induction was lost by co-expression of dominant-negative TβRII (Fig. 3B). However, LNCaP cells are reported to be weakly responsive to TGF-β1 due to very low expression of TβRII (53Kim I.Y. Ahn H.J. Zelner D.J. Shaw J.W. Lang S. Kato M. Oefelein M.G. Miyazono K.

Not surprisingly, we were unable to detect TβRII expression in these cells even after EGF treatment at the mRNA level by Northern blot or at the protein level by a significantly enhanced Western blot procedure (6Song K. Cornelius S.C. Danielpour D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4358-4367PubMed Google Scholar). However, the increased sensitivity of detection offered by semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that TβRII was elevated >4-fold following EGF treatment (Fig. 3C), indicating that EGF may enhance TGF-β responses through up-regulating TβRII levels.FIGURE 3EGF is permissive to the transactivation of the PAI-1 promoter construct, 3TP-luciferase, by TGF-β1 through a mechanism that involves TβRII expression and the elevation of endogenous TβRII mRNA. A, LNCaP cells were plated in 1% DC-FBS + DMEM/F12 and transiently co-transfected with 3TP-Lux and CMV-Renilla. B, LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with 3TP-lux, CMV-Renilla plasmids, and either pMFG-neo empty vector or pMFG-neo-DN-TβRII (dominant-negative TβRII). Cells were then treated with EGF (20 ng/ml), TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), or both EGF and TGF-β1, and luciferase activity was measured 48 h later. Data represent"

In both cases, Hh signaling proceeds through the activation of the seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), which is thought to convert the Gli family of transcription factors from transcriptional repressors to transcriptional activators. Here, we provide evidence that Smo signals to the Hh signaling complex, which consists of the kinesin-related protein Costal2 (Cos2), the protein kinase Fused (Fu), and the Drosophila Gli homolog cubitus interruptus (Ci), in two distinct manners.

This likely occurs through Hh-mediated Smo stabilization that facilitates additional HSC to associate with Smo through Cos2-mediated tethering (23Lum L. Zhang C. Oh S. Mann R.K. von Kessler D.P.

This phenomenon is somewhat contrary to our observation that, following Hh activation, the bulk of Cos2 releases from cellular membranes (27Stegman M.A. Goetz J.A. Ascano Jr., M. Ogden S.K.

We were able to modulate the Cos2-Smo association by overexpressing the Cos2 cargo domain and show that this domain can functionally separate the traditional read-outs of Hh pathway activation. We separate Fu and Cos2 hyperphosphorylation, Ci stabilization, and Cos2 membrane release from Smo accumulation and target gene activation in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that Smo regulates two arms of the Hh pathway, repression and activation, independently of each other and that this regulation can be functionally separated through targeting the Cos2-cargo Smo interaction. DNA Constructs—Act-renilla was constructed by subcloning Renilla from the pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) into pAct 5.1A (Invitrogen) via ScaI and BsrbI restriction sites. pAct 5.1 ci was generated by subcloning ci from pUAS-ci (1Aza-Blanc P. Ramirez-Weber F.A. Laget M.P. Schwartz C. Kornberg T.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) via KpnI restriction sites. pAct 5.1 3x HA-CSBD was generated by PCR amplifying base pairs 3001-3601 of Cos2 cDNA (corresponding to amino acids 1001-1201) with primers that introduce BglII sites flanking the Cos2 coding sequence. PCR products were cloned into pZero (Invitrogen) then subcloned via the BglII sites into pAc5.1A (Invitrogen) in-frame with an engineered 3× HA epitope tag. Because of its small size, a nuclear export sequence was added to the carboxyl terminus of the HA-carboxyl-terminal Smo binding domain (CSBD) construct to prevent passive nuclear diffusion. An HIV-1 reverse nuclear export sequence linker (5′-GATCCCTTCAGCTTCCACCACTTGAGCGACTTACCCCTA) (28Fasken M.B. Saunders R. Rosenberg M. Brighty D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1878-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was inserted in-frame 3′ of the CSBD coding sequence in the pAct 5.1 HA-CSBD plasmid. CSBD and CSBD-nuclear export sequence expressed at similar levels and had similar effects on Hh signaling by the ptc reporter assay and analysis of Hh-induced Fu and Cos2 shifts (data not shown). pAc5.1-GFP was generated by PCR amplifying EGFP from pEGFP (Clontech) with primers introducing a BglII restriction site 5′ and a BamHI site 3′ and cloned into the pZero vector (Invitrogen). EGFP was liberated from pZero via BglII/BamHI digest and subcloned into pAc5.1A at the existing BamHI site. Ligation inactivates the 5′-BglII/BamHI site but leaves the 3′-site intact for cloning purposes. CSBD-GFP was generated by subcloning CSBD from pZero into pAc5.1-GFP 3′ of EGFP via the intact BamHI site. pAct 5.1 myc-smo was generated by PCR amplification of myc-smo from pRM-myc-smo (gift from J. Hooper) with primers that introduced HindIII sites 5′ and 3′ of the myc-smo coding sequence. The myc-smo PCR product was cloned into a multiple cloning site shuttling vector via the HindIII sites, then liberated and cloned into pAc5.1A using EcoRV and NotI restriction sites. Ptc-luciferase was provided by P. Beachy (7Chen C.H. von Kessler D.P. Park W. Wang B. Ma Y. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), pUAS-smo-GFP was provided by M. Scott (29Zhu A.J. Zheng L. Suyama K. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1240-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), pUAS-smoC was provided by J. Hooper (30Hooper J.E. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fly Strains and Transgenes—pUAS-HA-CSBD was generated by liberating HA-CSBD from pAc5.1-HA-Cos2 SBD and introduced into pUAST (31Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using KpnI and XbaI restriction sites. Germ line transformation was performed by the Duke University Molecular Biology Core using standard protocols. When HA-CSBD was crossed into ptc-GAL4, CSBD expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis of wing imaginal disc lysates (data not shown). To generate smo RNAi-expressing flies, a 1012-base-pair portion of the Smo coding region one codon 3′ of the initiating methionine was amplified with 5′-(TTTTCTAGAGCAGTACTTAAACTTTCCGC) and 3′-(TTTTCTAGAAAGATTTTCACCGGCTGTAGG) primers. Two copies of the amplified sequence were subcloned into the P-element vector pWIZ (32Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Methods. 2003; 30: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) in a tail-to-tail fashion so that a double stranded RNA of the smo transcript could be expressed under control of the GAL4 system. Germ line transformation was performed as described (33Spradling A.C. Rubin G.M. Science. 1982; 218: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Dpp-LacZ flies were provided by D. Kalderon. Fly stocks were maintained on standard yeast-cornmeal agar at room temperature. Experimental crosses were preformed at 29 °C. Cell Culture and Assays—All cell transfections were performed using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. For all assays, Hh was provided via transfection of a full-length Hh expression vector (pAct FL-Hh). The ptc reporter assay and ptc-luciferase reporter construct have been previously described (7Chen C.H. von Kessler D.P. Park W. Wang B. Ma Y. Beachy P.A.

Reporter assays were preformed a minimum of three times, in duplicate. Error bars represent S.E. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaFl, pH 8.0) and cleared of nuclei by a 2000 × g spin. Postnuclear lysates were blotted using anti-HA to detect CSBD (Covance), anti-Ci155 (2A1), anti-Ci75 (CiN, gift from R. Holmgren), anti-Fu Hinge (20Stegman M.A. Vallance J.E. Elangovan G. Sosinski J.

For membrane binding assays cells were lysed hypotonically by Dounce homogenization in HKB (20 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.9). To prepare membrane pellets, postnuclear lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g in a table-top ultracentrifuge. Membrane pellets were resuspended by homogenization in HLB + 1% Nonidet P-40. For all experiments, DNA content is as follows: 1× is 250 ng, 2× is 500 ng, and 4× is 1 μg. The Hh expression vector was transfected at a ratio of 250 ng of DNA to every 3E6 cells. To determine the transfection efficiency of CSBD-GFP, two fields of cells were counted in bright field and fluorescent field. Averaged GFP and non-GFP cell numbers were used to determine the percent of cells expressing GFP. Immunoflourescence and Microscopy—Wing imaginal discs were collected and immunostained using standard methods, as described previously (24Ogden S.K. Ascano Jr., M. Stegman M.A. Suber L.M. Hooper J.E. Robbins D.J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1998-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Smo immunostain was preformed as described recently (13Jia J. Tong C. Wang B. Luo L. Jiang J. Nature. 2004; 432: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Discs and/or S2 cells were immunostained using anti-Ci (2A1), anti-HA (Genetex), anti-En (gift from C. Goodman) and anti-Smo (11F1) primary antibodies and appropriate Alexa-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). S2 cells used for immunolocalization assays were plated on Con A-treated slides and immunostained as previously described (24Ogden S.K. Ascano Jr., M. Stegman M.A. Suber L.M. Hooper J.E. Robbins D.J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1998-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35Ascano Jr., M. Robbins D.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10397-10405Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Percentages of cells demonstrating punctate or diffuse Smo localizations were determined by randomly counting 200-250 Smo-staining cells across three separate experiments. Confocal images of imaginal discs and S2 cells were collected using a Leica TCS SP confocal laser scanning microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Imaginal disc images were collected using a 20× objective at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution. S2 cell images were collected using a 100× oil-immersion objective at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution. For wing images, wings were mounted using DPX mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Services) and imaged using a Leica M212 dissecting scope with an Optronics DEI 750 camera and Metaview software. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 Previous studies have demonstrated that the primary interaction between Smo and Cos2, which appears to be required for Hh activation, is through the Cos2 carboxyl-terminal cargo domain (23Lum L. Zhang C. Oh S. Mann R.K. von Kessler D.P. Taipale J. Weis-Garcia F. Gong R. Wang B. Beachy P.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 25Jia J. Tong C. Jiang J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2709-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Ruel L. Rodriguez R. Gallet A. Lavenant-Staccini L. Therond P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether overexpression of the Cos2 CSBD could decrease activation of the Hh target gene ptc in Clone-8 (Cl8) cells. We found that CSBD is a strong inhibitor of Hh-mediated activation of a ptc-luciferase reporter construct, capable of decreasing maximal Hh activation by nearly 80% (Fig. 1A). CSBD-mediated inhibition can be rescued by overexpression of Ci, consistent with CSBD functioning upstream of Ci (Fig. 1B). A construct expressing the carboxyl-terminal tail of Smo (SmoC) affects both activation and repression of Hh signaling: SmoC promotes low level signaling in the absence of Hh and decreases signaling in Hh-stimulated cells (30Hooper J.E. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We were surprised to find that although both SmoC and CSBD inhibit Hh-mediated target gene activation (Fig. 1A), they differ in their effects on Ci, Cos2, and Fu. In response to Hh, full-length Ci155 is stabilized, resulting in a decrease of the proteolyzed repressor form, Ci75 (Fig. 1C, compare lane 1 with 4 and 7 with 10). SmoC has previously been demonstrated to alter this Ci155/Ci75 ratio in vivo, such that levels of Ci155 are decreased in Hh-responding cells (30Hooper J.E. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Accordingly, expression of SmoC in vitro decreases the Hh-induced stabilization of Ci155, resulting in a decreased Ci155/Ci75 ratio in Hh-stimulated cells (Fig. 1C, compare lane 10 with lanes 11 and 12). Interestingly, CSBD does not affect the ratio of Ci155/Ci75 in Hh-stimulated cells (Fig. 1C, compare lane 4 with 5 and 6). Further, although SmoC attenuates Hh-induced Fu and Cos2 hyperphosphorylation, CSBD has no effect on this phosphorylation (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 4-6 with 10-12). To confirm that the inability of CSBD to attenuate Fu and Cos2 phosphorylation or Ci stabilization were not the result of a population effect of non-CSBD-expressing cells, we expressed a GFP-tagged CSBD construct in Cl8 cells and calculated the approximate transfection efficiency. We then analyzed the lysates for Fu, Cos2, and Ci and found that even when transfection efficiency of GFP-CSBD approaches 80%, Hh-induced Fu and Cos2 phosphorylation and Ci stabilization are maintained (data not shown). GFP-CSBD represses reporter assay target gene activation to the same extent as HA-CSBD (data not shown). These results suggest that CSBD disrupts Hh signaling through a mechanism distinct from that of SmoC. CSBD appears to target a specific pool of Cos2-Smo complexes involved in the activation of Ci, but not in its stabilization, or the hyperphosphorylation of Fu and Cos2. SmoC, however, functions as a more general inhibitor, targeting all of these Hh-induced processes. To confirm that CSBD could repress the Hh-mediated activation of an endogenous gene, we overexpressed CSBD in Cl8 cells in the presence or absence of Hh. We found that, as with the ptc reporter construct, CSBD expression resulted in a significant reduction in Hh-activated expression of endogenous ptc, without affecting Hh-induced Fu phosphorylation (Fig. 1D, compare lane 1 with 4 and lane 4 with 5 and 6). Semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis confirmed that repression occurs at the level of transcription (data not shown). To determine whether CSBD could exhibit similar effects in vivo we expressed CSBD in Drosophila wing imaginal discs using the UAS-GAL4 system. We analyzed the wings of transgenic flies, as disrupted Hh signaling in the wing imaginal disc results in specific wing patterning defects in the adult (reviewed in Refs. 36Crozatier M. Glise B. Vincent A. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 498-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 37Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). Transgenic flies expressing CSBD under the control of the ptc-GAL4 driver demonstrate decreased spacing between LV3 and LV4 (Fig. 2, compare A with B) and proximal LV3-4 fusions (Fig. 2B, arrow), indicative of disrupted Hh signaling. Expression of CSBD in a Smo-sensitized background resulted in a robust enhancement of the Smo phenotype (Fig. 2, compare D with B). Smo-sensitized flies express a Smo double stranded RNA (Smo-RNAi), which primes them for the detection of factors that affect Smo function. 4D. J. Casso and T. B. Kornberg, unpublished data. Smo-RNAi flies do not demonstrate increased lethality but do show modest proximal fusions of LV3-4 (Fig. 2C, arrow) with normal LV3-4 spacing. The expression of CSBD in Smo-RNAi flies results in a near lethal phenotype. Approximately 4% of the flies escape lethality but demonstrate significantly decreased LV3-4 spacing and more pronounced LV3-4 fusions (Fig. 2D, arrows). These results are consistent with Smo being the in vivo target of CSBD. Our biochemical results suggest that CSBD can alter Hh target gene activity without affecting Ci stabilization. Accordingly, analysis of late third instar wing imaginal discs demonstrates that although the Smo RNAi-CSBD wings show strong Hh phenotypes, discs from CSBD expressing Smo-RNAi flies reveal a near normal Ci protein gradient (Fig. 2, compare E with F′, arrows). CSBD appears to have no observable effects on the normal Hh-induced stabilization of Ci occurring 3-8 cell diameters away from the anterior/posterior (A/P) border (Fig. 2, compare E with F′, arrow). However, the zone of highest level Ci activity, termed Ci*, and evidenced by decreased Ci staining immediately adjacent to the A/P border, is lost (Fig. 2, E and F′, arrowheads). Accordingly, expression of the Ci* target gene engrailed (en) in anterior compartment cells immediately adjacent to the A/P border is lost in CSBD-expressing discs (Fig. 2, compare E* with F*, brackets). Expression of the high level Hh target gene ptc is also decreased by CSBD expression (data not shown). Conversely, CSBD does not have a significant effect on expression of the low level target gene decapentaplegic (dpp) when expressed under control of the ptc-Gal4 (Fig. 2, compare G with H′) or apterous-GAL4 drivers (data not shown). These results are consistent with CSBD not affecting the Ci155/Ci75 ratio in Hh-responding cells, in that dpp expression is derepressed through Hh-induced attenuation of Ci75 processing (5Methot N. Basler K. Cell. 1999; 96: 819-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Taken together with our biochemical analyses, these in vivo results support the hypothesis that CSBD specifically inhibits an activating pool of the HSC involved in Ci activation but has little effect on the Hh-induced attenuation of Ci75 processing. Cos2 targets the HSC to vesicular membranes, independently of Cos2-Smo association (27Stegman M.A. Goetz J.A. Ascano Jr., M. Ogden S.K. Nybakken K.E. Robbins D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7064-7071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hh stimulates the release of the HSC from membranes concomitant with Cos2 and Fu hyperphosphorylation and Ci stabilization. To determine whether CSBD would affect the Hh-induced HSC membrane release, we expressed CSBD in Cl8 cells, in the presence or absence of Hh, and assayed for membrane association. In the absence of Hh stimulation the majority of Cos2 and Fu associate with cellular membranes both plus and minus CSBD expression (Fig. 3A, P fractions). In response to Hh, a significant amount of HSC releases from membranes (compare lanes 1 and 2 with 7 and 8, compare S fractions with P fractions). This membrane release is unaffected by CSBD expression (lanes 9-12, S fractions), suggesting that CSBD does not disrupt Hh activation through blocking HSC membrane release. However, expression of CSBD decreases Hh-induced Smo stabilization and phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, compare lane 8 with lanes 10 and 12, P fractions), consistent with CSBD targeting the rate-limiting step in Hh activation, Smo stabilization (15Denef N. Neubuser D. Perez L. Cohen S.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 23Lum L. Zhang C. Oh S. Mann R.K. von Kessler D.P. Taipale J.

Therond P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Hh-mediated stabilization and activation of Smo correlates with changes in its subcellular localization (15Denef N. Neubuser D. Perez L. Cohen S.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Cos2 may play a role in Hh-activated Smo movement (29Zhu A.J. Zheng L. Suyama K. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1240-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 38Nakano Y. Nystedt S. Shivdasani A.A. Strutt H. Thomas C. Ingham P.W. Mech. Dev. 2004; 121: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to determine whether CSBD disrupts Smo activation and/or stabilization through alteration of its subcellular localization. Because of their larger size, we found that Schneider 2 (S2) cells provide greater resolution for analyzing subcellular localization than Cl8 cells in immunofluorescence assays. To confirm that overexpressed Smo in S2 cells would behave in a manner similar to endogenous Smo in Cl8 cells, we expressed Myc-Smo in S2 cells in the presence or absence of CSBD and Hh and then analyzed lysates for Hh-induced Myc-Smo accumulation (Fig. 3B). In the absence of Hh, CSBD has little effect on Myc-Smo protein stability (Fig. 3B, compare lane 1 with 2). However, we found that, as with endogenous Smo in Cl8 cells, the Hh-induced stabilization of epitope-tagged Smo is dramatically reduced by CSBD (compare lane 3 with 4). To examine whether CSBD expression altered Hh-stimulated Smo relocalization to the plasma membrane, we transfected S2 cells with a plasmid expressing Smo in the presence or absence of CSBD and then analyzed Hh-induced Smo relocalization (Fig. 3, C-F). In the absence of Hh, Smo localizes to discrete puncta in ∼75% of cells (Fig. 3C). The remaining 25% of cells demonstrate a diffuse localization pattern (data not shown). In response to Hh, the population of cells demonstrating a diffuse Smo localization shifts such that ∼70% of the cells now show a more diffuse Smo distribution with evident plasma membrane localization (Fig. 3D). We noticed a striking change in Hh-activated Smo relocalization when CSBD was co-expressed (Fig. 3, compare F with D). Instead of an obvious shift to a more diffuse and plasma membrane localization pattern, Smo remains punctate in ∼65% of Hh-stimulated cells. We concluded that the Cos2 cargo domain-Smo interaction is necessary for the translocation of Smo, with HSC components, to the plasma membrane to activate Ci. In this work, we have demonstrated that targeting the association between Smo and the Cos2 cargo domain functionally separates the known molecular markers of the Hh pathway into two distinct categories: those events dependent on a direct association between the Cos2 cargo domain and Smo and those not dependent on this direct association. The Hh-induced readouts requiring direct Smo-Cos2 association include Smo phosphorylation, stabilization, and translocation to the plasma membrane, which facilitate intermediate to high level activation of Ci. Hh-induced Fu and Cos2 hyperphosphorylation, HSC relocalization from vesicular membranes to the cytoplasm, and Ci stabilization do not appear to require a direct Smo-Cos2 cargo domain association. Thus, although Smo is necessary for all aspects of Hh signaling (reviewed in Ref. 39Hooper J.E. Scott M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), only the molecular events grouped with Ci activation appear to require direct association between Cos2 and Smo. In vivo, CSBD expression is also capable of attenuating Hh signaling. This observation is consistent with our in vitro observation that CSBD inhibits critical requirement(s) for pathway activation (12Apionishev S. Katanayeva N.M. Marks S.A. Kalderon D. Tomlinson A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Jia J. Tong C. Wang B. Luo L. Jiang J. Nature. 2004; 432: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 40Zhang W. Zhao Y. Tong C. Wang G. Wang B. Jia J. Jiang J. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 267-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We have previously proposed a model suggesting the existence of two independently regulated pools of HSC, one involved in pathway repression (HSC-R), and one involved in activation (HSC-A) (16Ogden S.K. Ascano Jr., M. Stegman M.A. Robbins D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). HSC-R is dedicated to priming Ci for processing into the Ci75 transcriptional repressor, whereas HSC-A is dedicated to activation of stabilized Ci155 in response to Hh. Here, we provide evidence that the effects of these two HSCs can be functionally separated by specifically targeting the interaction between Smo and the Cos2 cargo domain. Moreover, we identify distinct molecular markers for each HSC. We propose that in HSC-R, the membrane vesicle tethered Cos2 functions as a scaffold to recruit protein kinase A, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and casein kinase I, which in turn phosphorylate Ci (40Zhang W. Zhao Y. Tong C. Wang G. Wang B. Jia J. Jiang J. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 267-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylated Ci is then targeted to the proteasome by the F-box protein supernumerary limbs (Slimb), where it is converted into Ci75 (8Jiang J. Struhl G.

In response to Hh, Fu and Cos2 are phosphorylated and dissociate from vesicular membranes and microtubules, which we suggest results in the attenuation of HSC-R function. This allows for the subsequent accumulation of full-length Ci. The mechanism by which HSC-R function is inhibited by Hh-activated Smo is not clear but appears to require the carboxyl-terminal tail of Smo and, by our analysis, appears to occur independently of a direct Smo-Cos2 cargo domain association. However, the direct Cos2-Smo association is critical for regulation of HSC-A. In the absence of Hh, HSC-A is tethered to vesicular membranes, through Smo, where it is kept in an inactive state. In the presence of Hh, Cos2 bound directly to Smo acts as a scaffold for the phosphorylation of Smo by protein kinase A, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and casein kinase I. Phosphorylation of Smo triggers its stabilization and relocalization to the plasma membrane with HSC-A (12Apionishev S. Katanayeva N.M. Marks S.A. Kalderon D. Tomlinson A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Jia J. Tong C. Wang B. Luo L. Jiang J. Nature. 2004; 432: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 14Zhang C.

Thus, Cos2 plays a similar role in both HSC-R and HSC-A. In the former case, coupling protein kinase A, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and casein kinase I with Ci and, in the latter case, coupling the same protein kinases with the carboxyl-terminal tail of Smo (Fig. 4A). An alternative interpretation of these data is that disruption of the Cos2 cargo domain-Smo association separates high and low level Hh signaling. It has been suggested that a second, low affinity Smo binding domain may reside within the coiled-coil domain of Cos2 (23Lum L. Zhang C. Oh S. Mann R.K. von Kessler D.P. Taipale J. Weis-Garcia F.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2709-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, high level signaling, where all aspects of the Hh pathway are activated may require both Cos2 interaction domains to be directly bound to Smo. In either scenario, HSC-R function would be regulated independently of HSC-A function. We conclude that targeted disruption of Cos2 cargo domain-Smo binding by CSBD is able to functionally separate the activities ascribed to our two HSC model. This two-switch system is amenable to the formation of a gradient of Hh signaling activity across a field of cells, in that the relative activity of HSC-R to HSC-A is directly proportional to the level of Hh stimulation a cell receives (Fig. 4B). The opposing functional effects of the two complexes can then establish unique ratios of Ci75 to activated Ci, resulting in distinct levels of pathway activation on a per cell basis.

J Chain-containing polymeric IgA (pIgA) and pentameric IgM bind pIgR at the basolateral epithelial surface. After transcytosis, the extracellular portion of the pIgR is cleaved at the apical side, either complexed with pIgs as bound SC or unoccupied as free SC. This transport pathway may be exploited to target bioactive molecules to the mucosal surface. To identify small peptide motifs with specific affinity to human pIgR, we used purified free SC and selection from randomized, cysteine-flanked 6- and 9-mer phage-display libraries. One of the selected phages, called C9A, displaying the peptide CVVWMGFQQVC, showed binding both to human free SC and SC complexed with pIgs. However, the pneumococcal surface protein SpsA (Streptococcus pneumoniae secretory IgA-binding protein), which binds human SC at a site distinct from the pIg binding site, competed with the C9A phage for binding to SC. The C9A phage showed greatly increased transport through polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transfected with human pIgR. This transport was not affected by pIgA nor did it inhibit pIgR-mediated pIgA transcytosis. A free peptide of identical amino acid sequence as that displayed by the C9A phage inhibited phage interaction with SC. This implied that the C9A peptide sequence may be exploited for pIgR-mediated epithelial transport without interfering with secretory immunity.

Mucosal epithelia form a barrier between the interior of the body and the external environment. At least 80% of all antibody-producing plasma cells of the body are located in the gastrointestinal and respiratory mucosae, and most of them are committed to production of dimers and larger polymers of IgA, collectively called pIgA 5The abbreviations used are: pIgA, polymeric IgA; pIgR, polymeric Ig receptor; SC, secretory component; SIg, secretory Ig; SpsA, S. pneumoniae SIgA-binding protein; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NIP, 5-iodo-4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl; TU, transducing unit.

These polymers contain, in addition to α-heavy chains and light Ig chains, a short polypeptide named the J chain that is required for binding to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) (3Johansen F.E.

This receptor, also called membrane secretory component (SC), is synthesized by secretory epithelial cells and delivered to the basolateral plasma membrane where it can bind pIgA and pentameric IgM. The receptor-ligand complexes are endocytosed and transcytosed to the apical cell surface by vesicular transport. At the apical surface, proteolytic cleavage of pIgR results in the release of secretory IgA (SIgA), a complex of pIgA and bound SC. Pentameric IgM is exported in the same manner, forming secretory IgM. Transcytosis and cleavage of unoccupied pIgR give rise to free SC in the secretions (2Norderhaug I.N. Johansen F.E. Schjerven H.

The pIgR is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, consisting of an ∼560-residue extracellular region, a 23-residue transmembrane region, and a 103-residue cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular region of pIgR contains five domains (D1-D5) that share sequence similarity with Ig variable regions (6Mostov K.E. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1984; 308: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the first domain (D1) of human pIgR was resolved (7Hamburger A.E. West A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1925-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SIgA performs several types of non-inflammatory defense functions. In addition, SC protects SIgA by delaying cleavage of the hinge/Fc region of the α-chain (8Crottet P. Corthesy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anchors SIgA to the mucus lining of the epithelial surface (9Phalipon A. Cardona A. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Edelman L. Sansonetti P.J. Corthesy B. Immunity. 2002; 17: 107-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Some pathogens, however, have developed strategies to exploit pIgR in order to invade the epithelium. IgA antibodies specific for herpes simplex virus and Epstein-Barr virus may facilitate internalization of the virus into pIgR-expressing epithelial cells (10Gan Y.J. Chodosh J. Morgan A. Sixbey J.W.

The binding to pIgR is mediated through S. pneumoniae SIgA-binding protein (SpsA), also known as choline-binding protein A (CbpA) or pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC). SpsA is able to bind human pIgR, free SC, or SIgA (bound SC) via a hexapeptide motif (YRNYPT) in its α-helical domain, which is conserved among many pneumococcal strains. This interaction is specific for human SC/pIgR and may mediate translocation of the bacteria across the epithelial barrier (15Zhang J.R. Mostov K.E. Lamm M.E. Nanno M. Shimida S. Ohwaki M.

Investig. 1995; 95: 493-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we used phage-display selection to identify short peptides that could bind human SC/pIgR. Such pIgR binding peptides may be ideal to carry bioactive molecules to the lumen by pIgR-mediated transcytosis. We identified several phages from two different phage-display libraries that bound human SC. One of these phages had the capacity to be transported by pIgR in vitro through a polarized epithelial monolayer. This transport was not affected by the presence of pIgA, and the pIgA transport was not hampered by the phage. A free peptide with identical amino acid sequence to that displayed by the phage was able to inhibit binding of the phage to SC, suggesting that the peptide alone was sufficient for binding. The binding of the phage to SC was inhibited by SpsA, implying that the phage binds elements in D3 and/or D4 of human pIgR. Reagents—Native free SC was purified from human colostrum as described (23Brandtzaeg P. Scand. J. Immunol. 1974; 3: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recombinant human pIgA and pentameric IgM were produced and purified as previously described (24Johansen F.E. Braathen R. Brandtzaeg P. J.

Recombinant expression of human and murine SC in 293E cells (CRL-10852; ATCC, LGC Promochem) has been described previously (16Elm C. Braathen R. Bergmann S. Frank R. Vaerman J.P. Kaetzel C.S.

Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, untransfected or stably transfected with human or mouse pIgR, were produced and maintained as reported elsewhere (27Røe M. Norderhaug I.N. Brandtzaeg P. Johansen F.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6046-6052PubMed Google Scholar, 28Natvig I.B. Johansen F.E. Nordeng T.W. Haraldsen G. Brandtzaeg P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4330-4340PubMed Google Scholar). Two phage-display libraries that present peptides of 6 or 9 random amino acids constrained by flanking cysteines, the Cys6 and Cys9 libraries, inserted in the gene 3 protein of the vector fUSE5 system have been detailed previously (29Lauvrak V. Berntzen G. Heggelund U. Herstad T.K. Sandin R.H. Dalseg R. Rosenqvist E. Sandlie I. Michaelsen T.E. Scand. J. Immunol. 2004; 59: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The complexity of the libraries is ∼2.2 × 107 and 5.5 × 107 for the Cys6 and Cys9 libraries, respectively. One random phage clone from each library, C6K (CAGAWSRC) and C9K (CVLGLHWSLAC), together with a 7-mer, 7K (LHVSQRG) were used as negative controls. The free C9A peptide, KCVVWMGFQQVCK, and an amino acid scrambled version, KCVQFQVWGMVCK, were synthesized on a robotic system (Syro MultiSynTech, Bochum, Germany) with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/O-tert-butyl chemistry and 2-chlorotrityl resin (Senn Chemicals AG, Dielsdorf, Switzerland). The identity of the peptides was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and purity was analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Two lysines (K) flanking the cysteines were included to increase the solubility of the otherwise highly hydrophobic peptide. The lyophilized peptides were stored at –20 °C and dissolved before use in distilled H2O. The concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm (A280 of 1 mg/ml solution, 3.66) for the free peptides. Recombinant fragments of SpsA designated SpsA SH2 (amino acids 37–283), SpsA SH3 (amino acids 37–158), and SpsA SM1 (amino acids 159–324) were produced as described (16Elm C. Braathen R. Bergmann S.

Affinity Selection, Amplification, and Phage Titration—For affinity selection, MaxiSorp tubes (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 500 μl of native human free SC at 30 μg/ml in isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The tubes were blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 1% (w/v) powdered skimmed milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/T). Approximately 1010 Escherichia coli K91K transducing units (TUs) from each library were preincubated for 30 min mixed 1:1 in PBS with 1% (w/v) BSA or skimmed milk, added to the tubes, and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. The tubes were then washed six times with PBS/T. Bound phage particles were eluted with 500 μl of 0.1 m HCl-glycine (pH 2.2) for 10 min and neutralized with 75 μlof1.0 m Tris, pH 9.1. The recovered phages were amplified by infection of E. coli K91K, and phage supernatants of pools of amplified phages or individual isolates were prepared as described (30Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Two more rounds of selection were performed with ∼109 and 108 TUs of amplified phage as input. Binding assays (elution-titration assays) were performed essentially as the affinity selection in wells of microtiter plates coated overnight with 200 μlof20 μg/ml of SC at 4 °C. PCR products of individual phage clones were produced and sequenced as described (29Lauvrak V. Berntzen G. Heggelund U. Herstad T.K. Sandin R.H. Dalseg R. Rosenqvist E. Sandlie I. Michaelsen T.E. Scand. J. Immunol. 2004; 59: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). ELISA—For SC binding ELISA, microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with 30 μg/ml of native free SC (or 5 μg/ml for the analysis of the C9A variants) in PBS at 4 °C overnight and blocked and washed as in the selection. 50 μl of the phage eluates after each round of panning or 50 μl (or 100 μl for the analysis of the C9A variants) of supernatant from individual clones (containing ∼1 × 1010 TU/ml) were preincubated with an equal volume blocking solution for 30 min, added to the wells, and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. Bound phages were detected directly by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase anti-M13 IgG conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1/4000 in PBS with 1% (w/v) BSA or skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature and revealed by ABTS substrate solution (ABTS tablets from Roche Applied Science in citrate buffer, pH 4.0). Indirect detection was alternatively performed with anti-M13 mAb 1/1000 (Amersham Biosciences) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit-anti-mouse antibody 1/1000 (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) incubated for 90 min and developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in diethanolamine buffer at room temperature. Absorbance was read after 10–60 min in a microtiter plate reader set at 405 nm (Tecan Sunrise Microplate Reader; Tecan Austria Gesellschaft, Salzburg, Austria) with Magellan 3.0 software. For ELISA with in vitro reconstituted SIgA, microtiter plates were coated with 100 μlof5 μg/ml of recombinant pIgA in PBS overnight at 4 °C or with 5-iodo-4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NIP)-BSA (2.5 μg/ml) in 0.05 m NaHCO3 (pH 9.6) overnight at room temperature and NIP-specific pIgA in a second step to bind the NIP-BSA. The plates were then blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA for 1 h before recombinant human or mouse free SC was allowed to bind for 90 min. ∼109 TU phages/well were added, and bound phage was detected by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 IgG. Successful binding of human or mouse free SC to recombinant pIgA was determined by incubation with a rabbit antiserum to human SC diluted 1/3000 (DAKO) or to murine SC 1/10000 (gift from Dr. Blaise Corthesy, Laboratoire de Recherche et Développement, du Service d' Immunologie et d' Allergie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antiserum to rabbit IgG diluted 1/2000 (Amersham Biosciences). In this ELISA, the TMB Microwell peroxidase substrate system (KPL) was used and the reaction stopped with an equal volume of 2 m H2SO4. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a Tecan Sunrise Microplate Reader. Inhibition of Phage Binding to SC—The C9A phage was co-incubated with a 2-fold dilution series of free peptides (starting concentration at 50 μm) or with recombinant pIgA, pentameric IgM, or SpsA fragments (starting concentration at 100 nm) in PBS/1% (w/v) BSA. The mix was incubated in SC-coated microtiter plates (30 μg/ml) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Bound phages were determined with anti-M13 antibody diluted 1/1000 (Amersham Biosciences) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody diluted 1/1000 (DAKO). A 2-fold dilution series of the C9A phage was used to determine the percentage phage binding compared with no competitor. Amino Acid Substitutions of the C9A Phage—Variants of the C9A phage, each with 1 amino acid substituted with alanine (for the 9 internal amino acids) or serine (for either or both of the cysteines), were constructed with synthetic oligo nucleotides and PCR essentially as described for library construction (29Lauvrak V. Berntzen G. Heggelund U. Herstad T.K. Sandin R.H. Dalseg R. Rosenqvist E. Sandlie I. Michaelsen T.E. Scand. J. Immunol. 2004; 59: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Single clone supernatants were prepared by infecting E. coli K91K cells as detailed elsewhere (30Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The sequence of each variant was confirmed by DNA sequencing, either in-house or at GATC Biotech AB. In Vitro Transcytosis—∼5.0 × 105 MDCK cells were seeded on 1-cm2, 3.0-μm collagen-coated PTFE filters (Transwell-COL 3494; Costar). The cells were grown to confluency for 3 days, providing a transepithelial resistance of ∼150 –200 Ω/cm2. The filters were washed in fresh medium and transferred to new wells with 200 μl of Hepes-buffered medium (20 mm Hepes; Invitrogen) containing 10 μl phage of ∼1 × 1010 TU/ml, and 200 μl of medium was added to the apical chamber. To control for paracellular leakage, 100 nm (15 μg/ml) native human IgG was included in the basolateral chamber; in some experiments 100 nm (37 μg/ml) recombinant pIgA was added. The filters were incubated for 8 h at 37°C after which the apical and the basolateral media were collected. The number of phages on either side was determined as E. coli K91K TUs. IgG and IgA were quantified by ELISA as described before (25Braathen R. Sorensen V. Brandtzaeg P. Sandlie I. Johansen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42755-42762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Affinity Selection of Peptides That Bind to SC—To obtain peptides with affinity to human SC/pIgR, we screened two different phage-display libraries for binders to native free SC. We found that a higher percentage of phage input bound to SC for each round of selection. From the Cys6 library the recovery of acid-eluted phages was 3.0 × 10–4% and 5.0 × 10–1% of the input in the first and third rounds of selection, respectively. For the Cys9 library the recovery increased from 3.0 × 10–4%to2.0 × 10–2% of the input from the first to the third round of selection. Furthermore, the SC binding ELISA (free SC as coat and anti-M13 phage for detection) performed with phage eluate revealed increased signals for each round, which supported an enrichment of positive binders during selection (Fig. 1). 20 individual phages recovered from the second round of selection and 20 recovered from the third round (from each library) were picked at random and screened by the SC binding ELISA. Of these 80 phages, 41 bound to SC. The amino acid sequence of the displayed peptide was deduced from 29 of the 80 selected phages by DNA sequencing. The results summarized in Table 1, showed that of 14 SC binding isolates from the Cys6 library only two unique sequences were found. Of 7 SC binding phages sequenced from the Cys9 library, 6 were identical. An independent selection of SC binding phages was performed with the Cys9 library. Screening of 88 individual isolates after the first round of selection and a further 88 after the second round resulted in identification of 81 SC binding phages. The sequences of 31 of these were determined and revealed three different Cys9-derived sequences, the most frequent isolate being identical to the frequently isolated phage from the first screen. The SC binding ELISA revealed that three phages (C6A, C9A, and C9D) gave much stronger signals than the other sequenced phages, suggesting a higher affinity to SC for these phages (Table 1).TABLE 1Sequences of the selected phage-displayed peptides that bound immobilized human free secretory componentScreenNameSequenceFrequencyA405 nm1.Cys6C6A-CQDPICFCGADGACYCTSRNC-12/161.22 ± 0.04C6B-CAWHYRFCGAAHSADGACREVFLVC-2/160.32 ± 0.021.Cys9C9A-CVVWMGFQQVC-6/131.89 ± 0.07C9B-CWTSGARWRLC-1/130.33 ± 0.01C6K-CAGAWSRC-0.16 ± 0.0032.Cys9C9A-CVVWMGFQQVC-13/351.26 ± 0.03C9C-CIIVPHAYAWC-6/350.31 ± 0.03C9D-CALVSEAGCLVWAA-12/350.70 ± 0.067K-LHVSQRG-0.06 Open table in a new tab We used either skimmed milk or BSA as blocking reagents during the selection. Although skimmed milk may contain bovine SIgA and free SC, the recovery of SC binding phages was not affected by blocking agent (data not shown). Furthermore, all SC binding phages were negative for binding to BSA or skimmed milk when recovered from a library screen that used the opposite blocking agent. Phage Binding to Human SC Compared with Mouse SC Complexed with pIgA—To further characterize the selected phages, we used ELISA to analyze binding to recombinant human or mouse SC that had been complexed with pIgA, i.e. reconstituted SIgA. Only the C9A phage was able to bind recombinant human SC in this assay (Fig. 2). None of the other phages showed binding to human SC in SIgA, and no binding activity was detected against mouse SC present in reconstituted SIgA. The C9C phage was not tested in this assay due to its low affinity for SC as compared with C9A and C9D. These results suggested that for C9B, C9D, C6A, and C6B the binding site on human SC was either masked in the reconstituted SIgA or these phages bound to epitopes exposed only on free SC when coated directly onto the microtiter wells. Importantly, however, the C9A phage showed binding specific for human SC, both when it was coated in free form directly onto plastic and when present as bound SC in reconstituted SIgA. Inhibition of the C9A Phage by Other SC Ligands—An abundance of pIgA-producing plasma cells in mucosal tissues ensures a high local concentration of pIgA available for pIgR-mediated epithelial export. Thus, an important aspect of pIgR-mediated targeting of mucosal therapeutics would be whether the phage would compete with pIgA for binding to the receptor. We therefore performed an SC binding ELISA with pIgA, pentameric IgM, or different fragments of SpsA as competitors of the phage C9A. Neither pIgA nor pentameric IgM competed with the phage for binding to SC, even at 100 nm concentration of these natural ligands (Fig. 3). Thus, the C9A phage utilizes a different binding site on SC from that of pIgA and pentameric IgM. However, the S. pneumoniae SpsA SH2 and SM1 fragments competed effectively with the C9A phage for binding to SC (Fig. 3). These fragments included the hexapeptide motif known to interact with SC/pIgR. A related fragment from SpsA, SpsA SH3, which lacks the SC/pIgR-binding hexapeptide, did not compete with the phage for binding to SC (Fig. 3). The SC binding ELISA performed with the C6A, C6B, C9B, and C9D phages showed that pIgA or pentameric IgM did not inhibit the binding of any of these phages to SC. However, the C6A phage was inhibited by the SpsA fragments SH2 and SM1 but not by SH3. The C6B, C9B, and C9D phages were not competed by SpsA (data not shown). Alanine/Serine Substitution Analysis of the C9A Phage—The Cys9 library contained ∼5 × 107 distinct phages. However, screening of this library identified only one phage that interacted with both human free SC and bound SC in reconstituted SIgA. To further dissect the C9A sequence, a series of recombinant phages, each with 1 amino acid substitution, were constructed. The 9 internal amino acids were each separately changed into alanine, while the 2 cysteines were altered to serine. In addition, both cysteines were mutated together into serine. These 12 new phage clones were analyzed by the SC binding ELISA as well as by acid elution of bound phage and enumeration by phage titration. Of the 12 substitutions made in the C9A sequence, only 3 retained some affinity to SC (Fig. 4). The same trend was observed with both methods of analysis. Exchange of the glutamine in position 8 for alanine had the least effect on binding to SC. In addition, substitution of glycine in position 5 or valine in position 2 into alanine was tolerated but reduced the level of phage binding almost 100-fold. Both flanking cysteines and the remaining internal amino acids of the C9A sequence were essential for the binding of the phage to immobilized SC (Fig. 4). Inhibition of the C9A Phage Binding to SC by Free Peptide—To test whether the identified amino acid sequence encoded by phage C9A was able to bind to SC independently of the phage particle, we performed competition assays with a synthetic peptide of identical sequence. Because the amino acid sequence displayed by the C9A phage was very hydrophobic, we flanked each cysteines in the free peptide with a lysine (KCVVWMGFQQVCK). A peptide with the same amino acid composition but with a scrambled sequence (KCVQFQVWGMVCK) was used as a control. The free C9A peptide clearly inhibited the binding of the C9A phage in SC binding ELISA, whereas the scrambled peptide did not (Fig. 5). This suggested that the binding of C9A phage to SC was sequence-specific and not dependent on peptide fusion to the phage. Transcytosis of the C9A Phage through pIgR-transfected MDCK Cells—The C9A phage specifically bound free SC as well as bound SC within reconstituted SIgA. To determine whether the C9A phage could be transcytosed by pIgR-expressing epithelial cells, we used human pIgR-transfected MDCK cells as well as mouse pIgR-transfected and untransfected MDCK cells. MDCK cells were seeded onto collagen-coated filters and allowed to form tight polarized monolayers. ∼1 × 108 TUs of either the C9A phage or a control phage were added to the basolateral chamber and incubated for 8 h at 37° C before the number of phages in the apical chamber was determined. The C9A phage was translocated 30–250-fold more efficiently by human pIgR-transfected MDCK cells than by untransfected MDCK cells or MDCK cells expressing mouse pIgR (Fig. 6A). Translocation of the control phage across MDCK cells was not significantly affected by pIgR expression being similar to the level of translocation of the C9A phage by MDCK ce"

Our results demonstrated a dissociated electrophysiological response characterized by both an abnormal reduction of the electroretinographic b-wave amplitude and a delayed latency, under the dark-adaptated condition. These alterations are compatible with a selective dysfunction of the rods. Antibodies raised against Trypanosoma cruzi that also interact with beta1-adrenergic receptor blocked light stimulation of cGMP-phosphodiesterase in bovine rod membranes. The specificity from the antibody-rhodopsin interaction was confirmed by Western blot analysis and antigenic competition experiments. Our results suggest an immunomediated rhodopsin blockade. T. cruzi infection probably induces an autoimmune response against rhodopsin in the chronic phase of Chagas' disease through a molecular mimicry mechanism similar to that described previously on cardiac human beta1-adrenergic and M2-cholinergic receptors, all related to the same subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors."
