https://openalex.org/W2032312044,"A human complementary DNA clone specific for the alpha-chain of the T-cell receptor and a panel of rodent X human somatic cell hybrids were used to map the alpha-chain gene to human chromosome 14 in a region proximal to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. Analysis by means of in situ hybridization of human metaphase chromosomes served to further localize the alpha-chain gene to region 14q11q12, which is consistently involved in translocations and inversions detectable in human T-cell leukemias and lymphomas. Thus, the locus for the alpha-chain T-cell receptor may participate in oncogene activation in T-cell tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1552488548,"A mechanism by which platelets might participate in fibrinolysis by binding plasminogen and influencing its activation has been examined. Binding of radioiodinated human Glu-plasminogen to washed human platelets was time-dependent and was enhanced 3-9-fold by stimulation of platelets with thrombin but not with ADP. The interaction with both stimulated and unstimulated cells was specific, saturable, divalent ion-independent, and reversible. The platelet-bound ligand had the molecular weight of plasminogen, and no conversion to plasmin was detected. Scatchard analyses provided evidence for a single class of plasminogen-binding sites on both stimulated and unstimulated cells. The Kd for thrombin-stimulated platelets was 2.6 +/- 1.3 microM, and 190,000 +/- 45,000 molecules were bound per cell, whereas unstimulated platelets bound 37,000 +/- 10,500 molecules/cell with a Kd of 1.9 +/- 0.15 microM. Plasminogen binding was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by omega-aminocarboxylic acids at concentrations consistent with a requirement for an unoccupied high affinity lysine-binding site for plasminogen binding to the cells. When platelet-bound plasminogen was incubated with tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, or streptokinase, gel analysis established that plasmin was preferentially associated with the platelet relative to the supernatant. Plasminogen and plasmin interacted with thrombin-stimulated platelets with similar binding characteristics, and there was no evidence for a binding site for plasmin which did not also bind plasminogen. Therefore, the results suggest that plasminogen activation is enhanced on the cell surface. In sum, these results indicate that platelets bind plasminogen at physiologic zymogen concentrations and this interaction may serve to localize and promote plasminogen activation."

https://openalex.org/W1702339793,"The association of agonists with muscarinic receptors in membranes from bovine brain was affected only slightly by guanine nucleotides. However, solubilization of these membranes with deoxycholate and subsequent removal of detergent resulted in a preparation of receptors with increased affinity for agonists and a large increase in response to guanine nucleotides. Chromatography of deoxycholate extracts of membranes on DEAE-Sephacel resulted in the separation of receptors from 95% of the guanine nucleotide-binding activity. Guanine nucleotides had no effect on the binding of agonists to these resolved receptors. The effect of guanine nucleotides was restored after the addition of either of two purified guanine nucleotide-binding proteins from bovine brain. One of these proteins, presumably brain GI, is composed of subunits with the same molecular weights (alpha, 41,000; beta, 35,000; gamma, 11,000) and functions as the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein isolated from liver. The other protein, termed Go, is a novel guanine nucleotide-binding protein that possesses a similar subunit composition (alpha, 39,000; beta, 35,000; gamma, 11,000) but whose function is not yet known. Addition of either protein to the resolved receptor preparation increased agonist affinity by at least 10-20-fold, and low concentrations of guanine nucleotides specifically reversed this effect. Reconstitution of receptors with the resolved subunits of Go demonstrates that the beta subunit alone had no effect on agonist binding, but that this subunit does appear to enhance the effects observed with the alpha subunit alone."
https://openalex.org/W1512678034,"We have examined the interaction of soluble plasma [3H]fibronectin with fibroblastic cells in suspension. Fibronectin labeled by reductive methylation binds to baby hamster kidney cells in serum-free medium in a time-dependent manner at 4, 22, and 37 degrees C, with half-maximal binding occurring in 12-15 min at 22 degrees C. The binding is saturable and reversible. At least 90% of the cell-associated fibronectin is external to the plasma membrane, as judged by trypsin susceptibility of the bound radioactivity. Scatchard analysis of the concentration dependence of binding indicates the presence of a single class of binding sites, even at low input concentrations of fibronectin. There are approximately 5 +/- 1 X 10(5) sites/cell with an apparent dissociation constant of 8.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(-7) M; thus, the binding of soluble fibronectin to these cells is of moderate affinity. This putative fibroblast fibronectin receptor is resistant to trypsin in the presence of physiological concentrations of divalent cations but is susceptible to trypsin in the presence of 5 mM EDTA. Binding of 0.1 mg/ml [3H]fibronectin is 60-80% inhibited by 8 mg/ml unlabeled fibronectin and 95% inhibited by 1 mg/ml purified 75-kDa fibronectin cell-binding domain, but is unaffected by 1 mg/ml 44-kDa collagen-binding domain or 5 mg/ml ovalbumin. The binding parameters determined in this study further define the fibroblast cell-surface fibronectin receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1600365637,"Rat embryo fibroblast cells grown under stress (e.g. heat shock, arsenite, or amino acid analogue treatment) show elevated levels of a number of proteins with apparent molecular masses between 28,000-110,000 daltons (i.e. stress proteins). It is shown that the smaller 28,000-dalton stress proteins, which do not contain methionine, are comprised of at least four isoforms, all of which appear related as determined by one-dimensional peptide mapping. [32P]H3PO4 labeling of normal and stressed cells demonstrates that three of the four 28-kDa isoforms are phosphoproteins. In the course of other studies phosphorylation of two 28,000-dalton proteins was observed in quiescent rat embryo fibroblasts following the addition of either the phorbol diester, phorbol-12-myristate-13 acetate, a calcium ionophore, A23187, or simply fresh serum. It is shown here that these two 28,000-dalton proteins are in fact two of the 28 kDa mammalian stress proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1557726811,"Receptor-mediated breakdown of PtdIns(4,5)P2 produces two cellular signals, Ins(1,4,5)P3, which can release intracellular Ca2+, and diacylglycerol, which activates a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). This study assesses the significance of protein kinase C in relation to phenylephrine- and vasopressin-induced Ca2+ mobilization in hepatocytes. Phorbol ester (4 beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate), which can directly activate protein kinase C, had no effect either on Ca2+ efflux from the cell (measured with arsenazo III) or on Ca2+ influx (measured with Quin-2), processes which are inhibited and stimulated, respectively, by both phenylephrine and vasopressin. No evidence of synergism between phorbol ester pretreatment of hepatocytes and the Ca2+ ionophore (ionomycin)-mediated effects on the increase of cytosolic free Ca2+ and phosphorylase activation could be obtained. These findings suggest that protein kinase C is not obligatorily involved in the regulation of hepatocyte Ca2+ fluxes. Pretreatment of hepatocytes with phorbol ester (PMA) or 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol totally inhibited the effects of phenylephrine in elevating the cytosolic free Ca2+; half-maximal inhibitory effects occurred at PMA and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol concentrations of 1 ng/ml and 12 micrograms/ml, respectively. In contrast, pretreatment with PMA had a much smaller effect on Ca2+ mobilization induced by vasopressin. These observations suggest that protein kinase C may be involved in down-regulation of the alpha 1-receptor in hepatocytes and may thus exert a negative influence on the Ca2+-signalling pathway."

The arachidonyl 5-lipoxygenase products 5-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) and 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) derived from [14C]arachidonic acid, and the omega-6 lipoxygenase products 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-OOH linoleic acid) and 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-OH linoleic acid) derived from [14C]linoleic acid and 15-hydroxyperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE), and 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) derived from [14C]- and [3H]arachidonic acid were identified by TLC-autoradiography and by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Products were quantitated by counting samples that had been scraped from replicate TLC plates and by determination of the integrated optical density during RP-HPLC. The arachidonyl 5-lipoxygenase had a pH optimum of 7.5 and was 50% maximally active at a Ca2+ concentration of 0.05 mM; the Km for production of 5-HPETE/5-HETE from arachidonic acid was 12.2 +/- 4.5 microM (mean +/- S.D., n = 3), and the Vmax was 2.8 +/- 0.9 nmol/min X mg protein (mean +/- S.D., n = 3). The omega-6 linoleic lipoxygenase had a pH optimum of 6.5 and was 50% maximally active at a Ca2+ concentration of 0.1 mM in the presence of 5 mM EGTA. When the arachidonyl 5-lipoxygenase and the omega-6 lipoxygenase were separated by DEAE-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography, the omega-6 lipoxygenase exhibited a Km of 77.2 microM and a Vmax of 9.5 nmol/min X mg protein (mean, n = 2) for conversion of linoleic acid to 13-OOH/13-OH linoleic acid and a Km of 63.1 microM and a Vmax of 5.3 nmol/min X mg protein (mean, n = 2) for formation of 15-HPETE/15-HETE from arachidonic acid."

Calcification is the principal cause of the clinical failure of these devices. In the present study, inhibition of the calcification of bioprosthetic heart valve cusps implanted subcutaneously in rats was achieved through the adjacent implantation of controlled-release matrices containing the anticalcification agent ethanehydroxydiphosphonate dispersed in a copolymer of ethylene-vinyl acetate. Prevention of calcification was virtually complete, without the adverse effects of retarded bone and somatic growth that accompany systemic administration of ethanehydroxydiphosphonate."

https://openalex.org/W2043434658,"Methanogenic and acetogenic bacteria metabolize carbon monoxide, methanol, formate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases and, in the case of certain methanogens, acetate, by single-carbon (C1) biochemical mechanisms. Many of these reactions occur while the C1 compounds are linked to pteridine derivatives and tetrapyrrole coenzymes, including corrinoids, which are used to generate, reduce, or carbonylate methyl groups. Several metalloenzymes, including a nickel-containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, are used in both catabolic and anabolic oxidoreductase reactions. We propose biochemical models for coupling carbon and electron flow to energy conservation during growth on C1 compounds based on the carbon flow pathways inherent to acetogenic and methanogenic metabolism. Biological catalysts are therefore available which are comparable to those currently in use in the Monsanto process. The potentials and limitations of developing biotechnology based on these organisms or their enzymes and coenzymes are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1595512796,"Monospecific rabbit antibodies have been prepared against ERp72, ERp99, and ERp60, major protein components of a detergent-solubilized extract of endoplasmic reticulum purified from mineral oil-induced plasmacytoma 315 tissue. When subcellular fractions of mineral oil-induced plasmacytoma 315 tissue were assayed by an immunoprecipitation procedure, all three endoplasmic reticulum proteins (ERps) were found to be enriched in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In murine lymphoid cells, the three ERps represent two major structural classes of protein. Both ERp72 and ERp60 contain no endoglycosidase H-sensitive, N-linked oligosaccharides. On the other hand, ERp99 is glycoprotein containing, in all likelihood, one endoglycosidase H-sensitive oligosaccharide. Immunologically cross-reacting proteins of similar molecular weight have also been detected in other eukaryotic cell lines. The anti-ERp antibodies were used to quantitate the synthesis and accumulation of the three ERps in splenic lymphocytes cultured in the presence and absence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli serotype B5:055) (LPS). In the presence of LPS, lymphocytes differentiate from resting cells into actively secreting cells. The synthesis of ERp72 and ERp99 increased 3- and 10-fold, respectively, in response to LPS. The synthesis of ERp60 does not change significantly. The turnover rates for these three proteins are similar in both control and LPS-treated lymphocytes. As a result, membranes isolated from LPS-treated cells are enriched in ERp72 and ERp99."
https://openalex.org/W1497290644,"Abstract The mechanism of interaction of the G-protein of retinal rods with rhodopsin and with nucleotides has been investigated using two independent techniques, light-scattering and direct binding measurements with labeled nucleotides. Binding of photoexcited rhodopsin (R*) and nucleotides are shown to be antagonist, and three conformations of the G-protein are described, each of which is proposed to be related to a different level of light-scattering, as follows: (a) the dark state, stable in the absence of photoexcited rhodopsin, in which the nucleotide site is poorly accessible and has a high affinity (dissociation constants, 0.1 microM for GDP and 0.01 microM for GppNHp); (b) the R*-bound state in which the nucleotide site is rapidly accessible with a lower affinity (dissociation constants, about 20 microM for GDP and GTP; 20-100 microM for GppNHp). Binding of R* to the G-protein therefore enables rapid binding or exchange of the nucleotide; this in turn reduces the affinity of the G-protein for R* (dissociation constants, 0.2 microM for G-protein with GDP bound and 2-10 microM for G-protein with GppNHp bound, compared to 1 nM in absence of bound nucleotide); and (c) the third state, the activator of the phosphodiesterase. In the presence of GTP, an additional irreversible and fast step, which is proposed to be the dissociation of alpha-GTP from beta gamma, is shown to occur; a steady state equilibrium is obtained, and the dissociation constant measured between GTP and this third state of the G-protein in the presence of R* is an apparent constant which depends on the rate of transconformation between the first two states and on the rate of GTP hydrolysis. The minimum value of this apparent dissociation constant for GTP (0.05-0.1 (microM) is obtained at high levels of illumination. Finally, some results (number of nucleotide sites and saturation of the rate of the light-scattering signal) suggest an oligomeric association of the G-protein."
https://openalex.org/W1514538091,"The purified insulin receptor kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of native tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs; MAP2, tau) on tyrosine residues. Insulin (10(-7) M) stimulated the reaction by 4-10-fold by increasing Vmax with little change in Km. alpha-Tubulin was preferred as a substrate for the kinase compared to beta-tubulin. MAP2 was found to be the best substrate among the cytoskeletal proteins tested; in the presence of insulin, the Vmax for MAP2 was 6.3 nmol/min/mg, its Km was 5.1 microM, and 1.7 mol of phosphate were incorporated per mol of MAP2. Under the same conditions used for this phosphorylation of tubulin and MAPs, actin and tropomyosin were very poorly phosphorylated. These data, coupled with previous evidence for potential functional relationships between insulin action and microtubules, raise the possibility that microtubule proteins may be cellular targets for the insulin receptor kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1488739710,"Native cytochrome b5 interacts with either RLM5 or LM2 to form tight equimolar complexes (Kd = 250 and 540 nM, respectively) in which the content of high spin cytochrome P-450 was substantially increased. Cytochrome b5 caused 3- and 7-fold increases in the binding affinities of RLM5 and LM2 for benzphetamine, respectively, and benzphetamine decreased the apparent Kd for cytochrome b5 binding. Upon formation of the ternary complex between cytochromes P-450, b5, and benzphetamine the percentage of cytochrome P-450 in the high spin state was increased from 28 to 74 (RLM5) and from 9 to 85 (LM2). Cytochrome b5 caused 13- and 7-fold increases in the rate of RLM5- and LM2-dependent p-nitroanisole demethylation, respectively. Amino-modified (ethyl acetimidate or acetic anhydride) cytochrome b5 produced results similar to those obtained above with native cytochrome b5. In contrast, modification of as few as 5 mol of carboxyl groups/mol of amidinated cytochrome b5 resulted in both a substantial loss of the spectrally observed interactions with either cytochrome P-450 LM2 or cytochrome P-450 RLM5, and in a loss of the cytochrome b5-mediated stimulation of p-nitroanisole demethylation catalyzed by either monooxygenase. In further studies, native and fully acetylated cytochromes b5 reoxidized carbonmonoxy ferrous LM2 at least 20 times faster than amidinated, carboxyl-modified cytochrome b5 derivatives. In contrast, amidination, or acetylation of amino groups, or amidination of amino groups plus methylamidination of the carboxyl groups did not appreciably slow the rate of reduction of the cytochrome b5 by NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. Collectively, the results provide strong evidence for an essential role of cytochrome b5 carboxyl groups in functional interactions with RLM5 and LM2."

https://openalex.org/W1524856167,"Studies of collagen synthesis by specific sections of individual fetal bovine costochondral junction growth plates were conducted and histologically related to the zones from which the sections were derived. Sections were metabolically labeled in organ culture to examine the synthesis of collagen and its precursors. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that Type II collagen was the major species synthesized in all tissue sections; 1 alpha, 2 alpha, 3 alpha collagen chains were synthesized in all growth plate sections and to a small extent in the fetal structural cartilage. A short chain collagen was synthesized predominantly in the zones of degeneration and provisional calcification and accounted for 8-12% of the radioactivity in this section. This short chain collagen has 63-kDa subunits which are converted to 46-kDa species by limited proteolysis with pepsin. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that both the pepsin- and non-pepsin-treated forms of short chain collagen are disulfide-bonded. Digestion with bacterial collagenase showed that the 46-kDa and a major portion of the 63-kDa forms are collagenous. Pulse-chase studies in organ culture did not demonstrate an obvious precursor to the 63-kDa form, and there was no conversion to the 46-kDa after 20 h. Synthesis of short chain collagen appears to be specific to the process of endochondral ossification in the growth plate; its appearance may be critical to this transition process."
https://openalex.org/W1505980680,"Gelatin-binding chymotryptic fragments from placental fibronectin contain polylactosamine carbohydrates (Zhu, B.C.R., Fisher, S.R., Pande, H., Calaycay, J. Shively, J.E., and Laine, R.A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3962-3970). We have separated polylactosamine-containing gelatin-binding fragments of placental fibronectin from their counterparts containing smaller N-linked saccharides using Sephadex G-200 gel permeation chromatography. The peptide portions of both fragments have similar amino acid composition and N-terminal sequence (see reference above). The strength of binding of these two glycosylation types of chymotryptic fragments to gelatin differs as shown by the following experiments. 1) Upon urea gradient elution of affinity-bound fibronectin fragments from gelatin-Sepharose chromatography, the apex of the elution peak for polylactosamine-containing fragments occurs at 2.0 M urea while the peak for complex N-linked carbohydrate-containing fragments maximized at 2.5 M urea indicating a tighter binding. Removal of polylactosamine sequences from the former glycopeptide by endo-beta-galactosidase digestion caused the elution peak for this fraction to change from 2.0 to 2.5 M, the same as for the complex N-linked carbohydrate-containing glycopeptide. 2) Competitive displacement experiments give an apparent dissociation constant of polylactosamine-containing fragments at 3 X 10(-9) M whereas this constant for complex carbohydrate-containing fragments is 1 X 10(-9) M. These results indicate that the binding of placental fibronectin to gelatin is weakened by the presence of high molecular weight polylactosamine carbohydrate. To our knowledge this is the first report that the type and extent of glycosylation of a glycoprotein can affect its binding affinity to a proteinacious ligand. Thus, fetal placental fibronectin may have different biological properties than fibronectins containing only the smaller N-linked complex carbohydrate."

https://openalex.org/W1597086232,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant which humoral concentration rises drastically following tissue injury or inflammation. CRP of all species binds to phosphorylcholine residues. In the present studies CRP was found to inhibit platelet-activating factor-induced platelet aggregation, and to stabilize platelet membranes against the lytic effect of lysophosphatidylcholine. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by CRP is accompanied by an inhibition of arachidonic acid release from both phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol. This suggests that phospholipases are inhibited. Hydrolysis of multilamellar dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes by purified phospholipase A2, was also inhibited by CRP. These results suggest that CRP can stabilize membranes from the detergent-like effects of lysolipids and from potentially toxic materials such as platelet-activating factor. By inhibition of phospholipases, production of inflammatory mediators would be blocked. CRP might thus act as an early protective recognition mechanism in acute inflammatory states."
https://openalex.org/W1487132084,"On the basis of inhibition analysis two bicyclic amino acid analogs appear to enter human red blood cells by much the same Na+-independent mediation, whereas striking differences are apparent in the routes for tryptophan and leucine, confirming a role for System T, but also suggesting the participation of a third system of low affinity somewhat selective for weakly basic amino acids. System T of the human cell is specifically inhibited by 4-azidophenylalanine, and is highly sensitive, relative to System L, to N-ethylmaleimide inhibition. Uptake by System T approaches its steady state much more slowly than does System L, and its participation in trans-stimulation is questionable, whereas that of System L is as usual strong. A different added transport system became apparent in the slow approach of the Na+-independent mediation of uptake of 3- and 4-carbon dipolar amino acids by the nucleated pigeon red cell to its steady state. In that cell System T makes at most a minor contribution. The patterns of trans-stimulation of fluxes among selected pairs of amino acids in the pigeon cell correspond to a usual participation in transmembrane exchange by System L, and also by the new transport system. An important but not the sole source of the heterogeneity in the pigeon cell is the participation of the system conspicuously involved in the transport of alanine, serine, and threonine, among other amino acids. This route of transport of these amino acids is made conspicuous by their small transport by other Na+-independent agencies, notably System L. Reactivity with this system is enhanced by a side change hydroxyl or sulfhydryl group. Uptake by this route as tested by threonine showed little inhibition by cysteinesulfinate under conditions inhibitory to System asc; also a sensitivity to lowering of pH unlike that seen with System asc. The new Na+-dependent transport system appears to be a species variant of quite similar Na+-independent systems discovered by Young et al. (Young, J. D., Ellory, J. C., and Tucker, E. M. (1975) Nature (Lond.) 254, 156-157; Fincham, D. A., Mason, D. K., and Young, J. D. (1982) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 11, 776-777) in sheep and horse erythrocytes on the basis of their absence in phenotypes. These authors have emphasized several similarities in these two cases to Na+-dependent System asc, and they propose that Na+ dependence has specifically been lost on maturation of the red cells without major changes in amino acid selectivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2126485894,"Bacillus subtilis dnaE encodes a protein essential for DNA replication and is tightly linked to rpoD, the gene for the major sigma factor of RNA polymerase. We have now determined the 1809-base pair sequence of the dnaE coding region, which precedes rpoD and is transcribed in the same counterclockwise direction on the chromosome. From the DNA sequence, we found that the dnaE protein comprised 603 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 68,428 daltons. This protein had significant and extensive regions of homology with Escherichia coli DNA primase, the polymerase that synthesizes short RNA primers during discontinuous DNA replication. Features of the coding and flanking regions that may modulate dnaE expression include a relatively weak ribosomal binding site (delta G' = -13.8 kcal), the use of uncommon codons in the reading frame, and no obvious promoter sequence for either dnaE or rpoD. Together, these results suggest that dnaE codes for B. subtilis DNA primase and, in light of the similarities to the organization of the E. coli sigma operon, that expression of dnaE may be coregulated with rpoD in B. subtilis."
https://openalex.org/W1521685662,"A high molecular weight glycoprotein found associated with a nuclear matrix-pore complex-lamina (NMPCL) preparation obtained from Drosophila melanogaster embryos has been shown by in vitro analyses to be largely confined to this subcellular fraction. In contrast with several of the NMPCL proteins, this glycoprotein remains completely insoluble after treatment with 5 M urea. It has, therefore, been possible to separate the glycoprotein from other NMPCL components by differential urea extraction. The glycoprotein in the 5 M urea-extracted pellet has been solubilized by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate and purified to near-homogeneity by sequential steps of chromatography on hydroxylapatite and Sephacryl S-300 (both run in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate), followed by affinity chromatography on lentil lectin-Sepharose. Over 30 hybridoma cell lines producing antibodies against this glycoprotein have been obtained. Monoclonality has been established for two of these lines (designated AGP-26 and AGP-78), and the antibodies they secrete have been further characterized. Western blot analysis has shown both antibodies to be monospecific (with respect to other Drosophila embryo polypeptides) for the major NMPCL glycoprotein; in addition, antibody AGP-78 has been shown to be weakly cross-reactive with glycoproteins of similar or identical molecular weight found associated with isolated nuclear fractions obtained from Xenopus oocytes, as well as chicken, opossum, and rat livers. Finally, both antibodies AGP-26 and AGP-78 react exclusively with the Drosophila nuclear periphery (nuclear envelope) in situ as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence analysis of larval cryosections. Based on these results as well as upon those of biochemical studies reported previously (Berrios, M., Filson, A. J., Blobel, G, and Fisher, P. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13384-13390), we conclude that the major Drosophila NMPCL glycoprotein is the specific homolog of the high molecular weight glycoprotein recently shown using immunoelectron microscopy to be a distinct component of the rat liver nuclear pore complex (Gerace, L., Ottaviano, Y., and Kondor-Koch, C. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 95, 826-837)."

https://openalex.org/W118921897,"The enzyme, previously called sepiapterin synthase A, has been purified by approximately 700-fold from the heads of Drosophila melanogaster. This enzyme catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent conversion of 2-amino-4-oxo-6-(D-erythro-1',2',3'-trihydroxypropyl)-7,8-dihydrop teridine triphosphate (dihydroneopterin triphosphate or H2-NTP) to two products, one of which we have identified as tripolyphosphate. The other product is a phosphate-free, unstable compound which is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of several other naturally occurring pterins in Drosophila. This product is stable enough under anaerobic conditions to allow it to be characterized as 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (6-pyruvoyl-H4-pterin). The 3-carbon side chain was identified as a pyruvoyl group on the basis of the susceptibility of the enzymatic product to reduction with tritiated sodium borohydride and the determination of the amounts and the sites of incorporation of tritium resulting from this reduction. From these observations, we suggest that this enzyme be renamed 6-pyruvoyl-H4-pterin synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1490991796,"Phospholipid synthesis was investigated in human Y79 retinoblastoma cells, a cultured cell line of retinal origin that retains many neural characteristics. Ethanolamine is taken up by Y79 cells through a high-affinity transport system and is utilized to synthesize ethanolamine and choline phosphoglycerides. High-affinity ethanolamine uptake has a K'm of 40.6 microM and a V'max of 1.06 nmol/min/mg protein, and the process is Na+ dependent. Choline is the only compound tested that reduced ethanolamine uptake, and very high choline concentrations were required to produce this effect. The cells incorporate ethanolamine into phosphatidylethanolamine and ethanolamine plasmalogen at equivalent rates, and the rates of catabolism of these phospholipids are similar. Only a small quantity of ethanolamine is incorporated into phosphatidylcholine, but the amount is not reduced by the addition of choline. Serine is incorporated into phosphatidylserine, which then is converted to phosphatidylethanolamine. Ethanolamine reduces but does not abolish this conversion. Unlike ethanolamine, only a small amount of serine is incorporated into ethanolamine plasmalogen. It is possible that the ethanolamine high-affinity uptake system is necessary to provide a neural cell with enough free ethanolamine for ethanolamine plasmalogen synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1584743796,"Addition of glucagon (20 nM) to the isolated hepatocytes from 24-h starved male rats results in an inactivation of glycogen synthase. The A0.5 for glucose-6-P is increased 2-fold over the control but the S0.5 for UDP-glucose is not significantly affected. The glucagon-stimulated inactivation of glycogen synthase is also accompanied by a 60-120% increase in the phosphorylation of the synthase. Glycogen synthase labeled with 32P by incubation of the hepatocytes with [32P] PO4(3-) was recovered by immunoprecipitation and the resulting immunoprecipitate was subjected to tryptic digestion. Analysis of the 32P-labeled peptides reveals that the sites corresponding to those phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and glycogen synthase (casein) kinase-1 (Itarte, E., and Huang, K.-P. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4052-4057) are rapidly phosphorylated in response to glucagon. These results demonstrate that glucagon not only triggers the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase through an increase in the intracellular level of cAMP but also, by an unknown mechanism, activates a Ca2+- and cAMP-independent protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1605257743,"Using stopped flow methods, we have measured the steady state rate constants and the inhibition by N3- and I- of the hydration of CO2 catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase III from cat muscle. Also, using fluorescence quenching of the enzyme at 330 nm, we have measured the binding of the sulfonamide chlorzolamide to cat carbonic anhydrase III. Inhibition by the anions was uncompetitive at pH 6.0 and was mixed at higher values of pH. The inhibition constant of azide was independent of pH between 6.0 and 7.5 with a value of KIintercept = 2 X 10(-5) M; the binding constant of chlorzolamide to cat carbonic anhydrase III was also independent of pH in the range of 6.0 to 7.5 with a value Kdiss = 2 X 10(-6) M. Both of these values increased as pH increased above 8. There was a competition between chlorzolamide and the anions N-3 and OCN- for binding sites on cat carbonic anhydrase III. The pH profiles for the kinetic constants and the uncompetitive inhibition at pH 6.0 can be explained by an activity-controlling group in cat carbonic anhydrase III with a pKa less than 6. Moreover, the data suggest that like isozyme II, cat isozyme III is limited in rate by a step occurring outside the actual interconversion of CO2 and HCO3- and involving a change in bonding to hydrogen exchangeable with solvent water."
https://openalex.org/W1546757590,"The chloroplast protein synthesis elongation factor Tu (EF-Tuchl) has been purified to near homogeneity from Euglena gracilis. Chromatography of the postribosomal supernatant of light-induced Euglena on DEAE-Sephadex reveals two forms of EF-Tuchl. Further purification has shown that one species consists of a complex between EF-Tuchl and a factor that stimulates its activity. The other species consists of free EF-TUchl. The factor has been purified from both chromatographic forms by taking advantage of the molecular weight shift that occurs upon disruption of the complex between EF-Tuchl and the stimulatory factor. EF-Tuchl consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of about 50,000. EF-Tuchl is as active on Escherichia coli ribosomes as it is on its homologous ribosomes but displays no detectable activity on eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosomes. It is stimulated in polymerization by E. coli EF-Ts and will form a complex with the prokaryotic factor that can be isolated by gel filtration chromatography. Like E. coli EF-Tu, it is sensitive to modification by N-ethylmaleimide and is inhibited by the antibiotic kirromycin. Thus, the chloroplast factor has many features that reflect the close relationship between prokaryotic and chloroplast translational systems."
https://openalex.org/W1509333448,"When Lactobacillus buchneri was grown in the presence of [hydroxyl-18O]serine and pyridoxamine, no 18O was found in its histidine decarboxylase (HisDCase). However, when pyridoxamine was omitted from the growth medium, the labeled serine was incorporated into the HisDCase without dilution. Internal serine residues of the enzyme contained 18O only in their hydroxyl group, while the COOH-terminal serine of the beta chain of HisDCase contained equal amounts of 18O in both its hydroxyl and carboxyl group. This enzyme, like the HisDCase from Lactobacillus 30a (Recsei, P. A., Huynh, Q. K., and Snell, E. E. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 973-977), therefore, arises by nonhydrolytic serinolysis of its proenzyme. This result, together with comparative sequence data (Huynh, Q. K., and Snell, E. E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2798-2803), makes it highly probable that all of the pyruvoyl-dependent HisDCases arise by a similar mechanism from inactive proenzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1562942503,"Little is known about the mechanism and control of lipoprotein particle fusion, although apoproteins are presumed to be important in maintenance of particle structure. This study characterizes the interaction of apo-B-containing low density lipoproteins (LDL) with cholesterol ester microemulsions (CEME) in the presence and absence of apo-A-I to determine if a role for these apoproteins in particle integrity could be ascertained. CEME are an apoprotein-free analog of LDL formed by sonication of radiolabeled phospholipid (surface) and cholesterol ester (core). Incubation of CEME with LDL followed by precipitation of LDL with MnCl2 resulted in coprecipitation of CEME with LDL that was time-, temperature-, and concentration-, but not pH (pH 6-9)-, dependent and occurred over a wide range of CEME and LDL particle compositions. Particles from the incubation were larger than the unincubated particles and intermediate in density and electrophoretic mobility between the starting LDL and CEME. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments suggested that CEME surface and core lipids had mixed with those of LDL. When particles from incubations were exposed to an anti-apo-B column, radiolabeled surface and core molecules originating from the CEME particles bound to the column. Particles eluted at low pH from the anti-apo-B column were irregularly shaped and had excess surface material as judged by electron microscopy. Incubation of CEME with LDL in the presence of 3 M KBr or 4% bovine serum albumin did not alter the interaction of the particles. However, incubation of CEME with LDL in the presence of apo-A-I (2:1 CEME cholesterol-to-apo-A-I mass ratio) greatly reduced the interaction of the LDL and CEME particles. We conclude that the incubation of CEME with isolated LDL resulted in particle fusion that was prevented by apo-A-I."
https://openalex.org/W1600220592,"Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.1, purine nucleoside:orthophosphate ribosyltransferase) was purified and characterized from the malarial parasite, Plasmodium lophurae, using a chromatofocusing (Pharmacia) column and a formycin B affinity column. The apparent isoelectric point of the native protein, as determined by chromatofocusing, was 6.80. By gel filtration and both native and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the native enzyme appeared to be a pentamer with a native molecular weight of 125,300 and a subunit molecular weight of 23,900. The enzyme had a broad pH optimum, pH 5.5-7.5, with maximum activity at pH 6.0-6.5. The enzyme reaction was readily reversible with a Km for inosine of 33 microM and a Km for hypoxanthine of 82 microM. Thioinosine, guanosine, and guanine were also substrates for the plasmodial enzyme, but allopurinol and adenine were not. The parasite enzyme was competitively inhibited by formycin B (Ki = 0.39 microM). Formycin A, azaguanine, and 8-aminoguanosine were not inhibitors of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1573764481,"Smooth muscle from calf aorta is homogenized and centrifuged. The insoluble material is subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. When the heaviest fraction so obtained is incubated with radioactive ATP, two components incorporate most of the acid-insoluble radioactivity. One is a phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of 21,000. It has been identified as myosin light chain by its molecular weight, isoelectric point, and precipitation by antibody to calf aorta myosin. Its phosphorylation is strongly inhibited by EGTA, in agreement with published reports that myosin light chain kinase of smooth muscle is Ca2+ dependent. The other product is of low molecular weight, is extracted into acidic chloroform-methanol, and has been identified as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. Adenosine and 5‘-chloro-5‘-deoxyadenosine, which are vasodilators, inhibit the phosphorylation of both substrates. Phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol is inhibited at lower concentrations of the nucleosides than is the phosphorylation of myosin light chain. The inhibitory effects of the two nucleosides are not associated with changes in the concentration of cyclic AMP. The precise function of phosphatidylinositol phosphorylation in smooth muscle is not known, but correlations between smooth muscle contraction and increased turnover of phosphatidylinositol and its mono- and diphosphates have been reported. Myosin light chain is phosphorylated under conditions which favor smooth muscle contraction. We conclude that the inhibitory effects of adenosine described here are consistent with their physiological action as vasodilators."
https://openalex.org/W1490701850,"Fatty acid synthase from the uropygial gland was inactivated by treatment with pyrenebutyl methanephosphonofluoridate by specific modification of the serine at the thioesterase domain. Treatment of fatty acid synthase with 3-(4-maleimidylphenyl)-7-diethylamino-4-methylcoumarin resulted in the loss of the condensation activity and overall synthase activity. Acetyl-CoA and malenyl-CoA protected the enzyme from inactivation by this reagent suggesting that the pantetheine thiol was modified. In support of this conclusion was the finding that modification of the primer-binding thiol with iodoacetamide prior to the modification with the coumarin derivative resulted in no change in the binding of the coumarin to the enzyme. Furthermore, the presumptive active site peptide isolated after proteolysis released its attached coumarin upon treatment with alkali under beta-elimination reaction conditions. Graphical analysis of the binding data suggested that binding of one coumarin derivative/subunit of the synthase would result in complete loss of the synthase activity. When the synthase was modified with the coumarin and pyrene derivatives, fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurred from the pyrene at the thioesterase site to the coumarin attached to the pantetheine thiol. Dissociation of the enzyme to monomers did not decrease the efficiency of transfer, but limited trypsin treatment, which released the thioesterase domain, abolished the fluorescence resonance energy transfer. These results suggested that the energy transfer occurred between intrasubunit sites. The distance between the pyrene at the thioesterase active site and the coumarin attached to pantetheine thiol on the same subunit of fatty acid synthase was estimated from the efficiency of energy transfer to be 37 A."
https://openalex.org/W1500000762,"Treatment with murine gamma-interferon (IFN) preparations of variant sublines of Friend leukemia cells resistant to the alpha, beta IFN-induced antiviral state (Affabris, E., Jemma, C., and Rossi, G.B. (1982) Virology 120, 441-452; Affabris, E., Romeo, G., Belardelli, F., Jemma, C., Mechti, N., Gresser, I., and Rossi, G. B. (1983) Virology 125, 508-512) results in the establishment of a bona fide antiviral state. In fact, gamma IFN preparations are able to induce a dose-dependent reduction of endogenous virus release and of vesicular stomatitis or encephalomyocarditis viruses yields (up to 1.5 log). Under these experimental conditions, no inducible 2-5A synthetase activity is detectable in cell extracts. The 67-kDa protein kinase, uninducible by treatment with alpha, beta IFN (up to 13,000 units/ml), is instead induced upon treatment with gamma IFN at a similar rate of activity as in wild-type Friend leukemia cells, both when assayed in solution and after immobilization on poly(rI) X poly(rC)-agarose."
https://openalex.org/W1865288239,"Quantitative aspects of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in rat hepatocytes were monitored. A reduction of intracellular UTP contents by different concentrations of D-galactosamine led to a dose-dependent increase of 14CO2 incorporation into the sum of all acid-soluble uracil nucleotides. In controls the rate of de novo synthesis which was calculated from the incorporation rate of 14CO2 into the sum of all acid-soluble uracil nucleotides was 0.014 mumol X h-1 X g-1 compared to 0.056 mumol X h-1 X g-1 wet weight of liver in situations of a maximally stimulated de novo synthesis. Incubation of hepatocytes with uridine led to a dose-dependent reduction of 14CO2 incorporation to less than 25% of the amount incorporated in the controls. Alterations of the CTP content had no influence on the 14CO2 incorporation. In the presence of high D-galactosamine concentrations the increase of the total amount of acid-soluble uracil nucleotides exceeded the rate of the de novo synthesis derived from the incorporation of 14CO2 into the sum of the acid-soluble uracil nucleotide pool. It was also greater than the increase of the total amount of intra- and extracellular orotate after acidic hydrolysis--even in the presence of 6-azauridine, which stimulated de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis by itself."
