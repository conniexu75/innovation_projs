https://openalex.org/W2138014988,"Spontaneously arising (de novo) mutations have an important role in medical genetics. For diseases with extensive locus heterogeneity, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), the signal from de novo mutations is distributed across many genes, making it difficult to distinguish disease-relevant mutations from background variation. Here we provide a statistical framework for the analysis of excesses in de novo mutation per gene and gene set by calibrating a model of de novo mutation. We applied this framework to de novo mutations collected from 1,078 ASD family trios, and, whereas we affirmed a significant role for loss-of-function mutations, we found no excess of de novo loss-of-function mutations in cases with IQ above 100, suggesting that the role of de novo mutations in ASDs might reside in fundamental neurodevelopmental processes. We also used our model to identify ∼1,000 genes that are significantly lacking in functional coding variation in non-ASD samples and are enriched for de novo loss-of-function mutations identified in ASD cases."
https://openalex.org/W2051658465,"Large-scale surveys of single-cell gene expression have the potential to reveal rare cell populations and lineage relationships but require efficient methods for cell capture and mRNA sequencing. Although cellular barcoding strategies allow parallel sequencing of single cells at ultra-low depths, the limitations of shallow sequencing have not been investigated directly. By capturing 301 single cells from 11 populations using microfluidics and analyzing single-cell transcriptomes across downsampled sequencing depths, we demonstrate that shallow single-cell mRNA sequencing (~50,000 reads per cell) is sufficient for unbiased cell-type classification and biomarker identification. In the developing cortex, we identify diverse cell types, including multiple progenitor and neuronal subtypes, and we identify EGR1 and FOS as previously unreported candidate targets of Notch signaling in human but not mouse radial glia. Our strategy establishes an efficient method for unbiased analysis and comparison of cell populations from heterogeneous tissue by microfluidic single-cell capture and low-coverage sequencing of many cells."
https://openalex.org/W2083048982,"Understanding the structure-function relationships at cellular, circuit, and organ-wide scale requires 3D anatomical and phenotypical maps, currently unavailable for many organs across species. At the root of this knowledge gap is the absence of a method that enables whole-organ imaging. Herein, we present techniques for tissue clearing in which whole organs and bodies are rendered macromolecule-permeable and optically transparent, thereby exposing their cellular structure with intact connectivity. We describe PACT (passive clarity technique), a protocol for passive tissue clearing and immunostaining of intact organs; RIMS (refractive index matching solution), a mounting media for imaging thick tissue; and PARS (perfusion-assisted agent release in situ), a method for whole-body clearing and immunolabeling. We show that in rodents PACT, RIMS, and PARS are compatible with endogenous-fluorescence, immunohistochemistry, RNA single-molecule FISH, long-term storage, and microscopy with cellular and subcellular resolution. These methods are applicable for high-resolution, high-content mapping and phenotyping of normal and pathological elements within intact organs and bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2103324798,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with characteristics of breast cancer stem cells, including chemoresistance and radioresistance. However, it is unclear whether EMT itself or specific EMT regulators play causal roles in these properties. Here we identify an EMT-inducing transcription factor, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), as a regulator of radiosensitivity and DNA damage response. Radioresistant subpopulations of breast cancer cells derived from ionizing radiation exhibit hyperactivation of the kinase ATM and upregulation of ZEB1, and the latter promotes tumour cell radioresistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ATM phosphorylates and stabilizes ZEB1 in response to DNA damage, ZEB1 in turn directly interacts with USP7 and enhances its ability to deubiquitylate and stabilize CHK1, thereby promoting homologous recombination-dependent DNA repair and resistance to radiation. These findings identify ZEB1 as an ATM substrate linking ATM to CHK1 and the mechanism underlying the association between EMT and radioresistance."
https://openalex.org/W2041617023,"Metastasis remains the most common cause of death in most cancers, with limited therapies for combating disseminated disease. While the primary tumour microenvironment is an important regulator of cancer progression, it is less well understood how different tissue environments influence metastasis. We analysed tumour–stroma interactions that modulate organ tropism of brain, bone and lung metastasis in xenograft models. We identified a number of potential modulators of site-specific metastasis, including cathepsin S as a regulator of breast-to-brain metastasis. High cathepsin S expression at the primary site correlated with decreased brain metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients. Both macrophages and tumour cells produce cathepsin S, and only the combined depletion significantly reduced brain metastasis in vivo. Cathepsin S specifically mediates blood–brain barrier transmigration through proteolytic processing of the junctional adhesion molecule, JAM-B. Pharmacological inhibition of cathepsin S significantly reduced experimental brain metastasis, supporting its consideration as a therapeutic target for this disease. Joyce and colleagues analyse tumour–stroma interactions in distinct metastatic microenvironments, and show that cathepsin S promotes brain metastasis by cleaving the JAM-B junctional protein, allowing cancer cells to traverse the blood–brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2079591709,"By aggregating self-reported health statuses across millions of users, we seek to characterize the variety of health information discussed in Twitter. We describe a topic modeling framework for discovering health topics in Twitter, a social media website. This is an exploratory approach with the goal of understanding what health topics are commonly discussed in social media. This paper describes in detail a statistical topic model created for this purpose, the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM), as well as our system for filtering general Twitter data based on health keywords and supervised classification. We show how ATAM and other topic models can automatically infer health topics in 144 million Twitter messages from 2011 to 2013. ATAM discovered 13 coherent clusters of Twitter messages, some of which correlate with seasonal influenza (r = 0.689) and allergies (r = 0.810) temporal surveillance data, as well as exercise (r = .534) and obesity (r = −.631) related geographic survey data in the United States. These results demonstrate that it is possible to automatically discover topics that attain statistically significant correlations with ground truth data, despite using minimal human supervision and no historical data to train the model, in contrast to prior work. Additionally, these results demonstrate that a single general-purpose model can identify many different health topics in social media."
https://openalex.org/W2166037829,"Antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria enter wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), an environment where resistance genes can potentially spread and exchange between microbes. Several antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were quantified using qPCR in three WWTPs of decreasing capacity located in Helsinki, Tallinn, and Tartu, respectively: sulphonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2), tetracycline resistance genes (tetM and tetC), and resistance genes for extended spectrum beta-lactams (blaoxa-58, blashv-34, and blactx-m-32). To avoid inconsistencies among qPCR assays we normalised the ARG abundances with 16S rRNA gene abundances while assessing if the respective genes increased or decreased during treatment. ARGs were detected in most samples; sul1, sul2, and tetM were detected in all samples. Statistically significant differences (adjusted p<0.01) between the inflow and effluent were detected in only four cases. Effluent values for blaoxa-58 and tetC decreased in the two larger plants while tetM decreased in the medium-sized plant. Only blashv-34 increased in the effluent from the medium-sized plant. In all other cases the purification process caused no significant change in the relative abundance of resistance genes, while the raw abundances fell by several orders of magnitude. Standard water quality variables (biological oxygen demand, total phosphorus and nitrogen, etc.) were weakly related or unrelated to the relative abundance of resistance genes. Based on our results we conclude that there is neither considerable enrichment nor purification of antibiotic resistance genes in studied conventional WWTPs."
https://openalex.org/W2097144131,"In odorant-rich environments, animals must be able to detect specific odorants of interest against variable backgrounds. However, studies have found that both humans and rodents are poor at analyzing the components of odorant mixtures, suggesting that olfaction is a synthetic sense in which mixtures are perceived holistically. We found that mice could be easily trained to detect target odorants embedded in unpredictable and variable mixtures. To relate the behavioral performance to neural representation, we imaged the responses of olfactory bulb glomeruli to individual odors in mice expressing the Ca(2+) indicator GCaMP3 in olfactory receptor neurons. The difficulty of segregating the target from the background depended strongly on the extent of overlap between the glomerular responses to target and background odors. Our study indicates that the olfactory system has powerful analytic abilities that are constrained by the limits of combinatorial neural representation of odorants at the level of the olfactory receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1997870035,"In this resource, the authors provide a comprehensive map of the thalamocortical projections in the mouse brain. To do this, they employed 254 highly overlapping injections of viral vectors to label and characterize long-range projections. Using this map as a framework, the authors determine the functionality of a subset of these connections via expression and activation of channelrhodopsin. The thalamus relays sensori-motor information to the cortex and is an integral part of cortical executive functions. The precise distribution of thalamic projections to the cortex is poorly characterized, particularly in mouse. We employed a systematic, high-throughput viral approach to visualize thalamocortical axons with high sensitivity. We then developed algorithms to directly compare injection and projection information across animals. By tiling the mouse thalamus with 254 overlapping injections, we constructed a comprehensive map of thalamocortical projections. We determined the projection origins of specific cortical subregions and verified that the characterized projections formed functional synapses using optogenetic approaches. As an important application, we determined the optimal stereotaxic coordinates for targeting specific cortical subregions and expanded these analyses to localize cortical layer–preferential projections. This data set will serve as a foundation for functional investigations of thalamocortical circuits. Our approach and algorithms also provide an example for analyzing the projection patterns of other brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W1993512405,"Obesity and aging result in elevated levels of central TGF-β, resulting in hypothalamic inflammation and the development of type 2 diabetes. The brain, in particular the hypothalamus, plays a role in regulating glucose homeostasis; however, it remains unclear whether this organ is causally and etiologically involved in the development of diabetes. Here, we found that hypothalamic transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) production is excessive under conditions of not only obesity but also aging, which are two general etiological factors of type 2 diabetes. Pharmacological and genetic approaches revealed that central TGF-β excess caused hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance independent of a change in body weight. Further, using cell-specific genetic analyses in vivo, we found that astrocytes and proopiomelanocortin neurons are responsible for the production and prodiabetic effect of central TGF-β, respectively. Mechanistically, TGF-β excess induced a hypothalamic RNA stress response, resulting in accelerated mRNA decay of IκBα, an inhibitor of proinflammatory nuclear factor-κB. These results reveal an atypical, mRNA metabolism–driven hypothalamic nuclear factor-κB activation, a mechanism that links obesity as well as aging to hypothalamic inflammation and ultimately to type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1980180109,"Trey Ideker and colleagues report a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, reporting that TP53 mutations are frequently accompanied by loss of chromosome 3p. Their data indicate that the combination of these two events has a stronger negative effect on survival rate than either event alone. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterized by aggressive behavior with a propensity for metastasis and recurrence. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of the molecular and clinical features of HNSCC that govern patient survival. We find that TP53 mutation is frequently accompanied by loss of chromosome 3p and that the combination of these events is associated with a surprising decrease in survival time (1.9 years versus >5 years for TP53 mutation alone). The TP53-3p interaction is specific to chromosome 3p and validates in HNSCC and pan-cancer cohorts. In human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive tumors, in which HPV inactivates TP53, 3p deletion is also common and is associated with poor outcomes. The TP53-3p event is modified by mir-548k expression, which decreases survival further, and is mutually exclusive with mutations affecting RAS signaling. Together, the identified markers underscore the molecular heterogeneity of HNSCC and enable a new multi-tiered classification of this disease."

However, the number and location of GABAAR-binding sites for propofol remain uncertain. GABAARs are members of the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels formed by five identical or homologous subunits that associate around a central axis that forms the ion channel (5.Miller P.S.

Each subunit is made up of an N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain (TMD) formed by a loose bundle of four transmembrane helices (M1–M4), with amino acids on one face of each M2 helix contributing to the lumen of the ion channel, and an intracellular domain formed by the amino acids between the M3 and M4 helices. γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor 2-isopropyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]phenol o-propofol diazirine 2-(3-methyl-3H-diaziren-3-yl)ethyl 1-(phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate 2-ethyl 1-(phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate 4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]benzyl-1-(1-phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate 5-allyl-1-methyl-5-(m-trifluoromethyl-diazirynylphenyl)barbituric acid nicotinic acetylcholine receptor transmembrane domain S. aureus endopeptidase Glu-C L. enzymogenes endoproteinase Lys-C reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography o-phthalaldehyde 3-bromo-3-methyl-2-(2-nitrophenylthio)-3H-indole propofol phenylthiohydantoin.

In these models, βM2–15′ and βM3–4′, positions that are also sensitivity determinants for the intravenous anesthetic etomidate, are present in a pocket at the interface between the β and α subunits that contains the transmitter-binding sites in the extracellular domain (referred to as the β+-α− interface) (16.Chiara D.C.

That etomidate binds to this intersubunit site was established by the etomidate-inhibitable photoincorporation of reactive etomidate analogs into βM3–4′ and α1Met-236 in αM1 in a heterogeneous population of GABAARs purified from bovine brain (18.Li G.-D.

Recently, photoaffinity labeling studies with R-[3H]mTFD-MPAB, a photoreactive barbiturate, identified a second class of general anesthetic-binding sites in human α1β3γ2 GABAARs at the β−-α+ and β−-γ+ subunit interfaces (19.Chiara D.C. Jayakar S.S. Zhou X. Zhang X. Savechenkov P.Y. Bruzik K.S. Miller K.W. Cohen J.B.

Although etomidate bound selectively to the β+ interface sites and certain barbiturates bound selectively at the β− interface sites, propofol inhibited photolabeling at both classes of sites, but only at concentrations (IC50 ∼40 µm) that were ∼10-fold higher than the concentrations necessary to potentiate GABA responses. This discrepancy suggests that propofol may bind with higher affinity to other, as yet unidentified, sites in the GABAAR. A reactive propofol analog (o-propofol diazirine (o-PD)) was recently shown to photoincorporate in expressed α1β3 GABAAR into β3His-267 (βM2–17′), an amino acid in the β subunit M2 helix in proximity to the R-mTFD-MPAB site, but projecting into the lumen of the ion channel near the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains (20.Yip G.M.

In this report, we identify propofol-binding sites in a purified human α1β3 GABAAR using 2-isopropyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]phenol (AziPm), a photoreactive propofol analog that potentiates GABA responses and acts as a general anesthetic (Fig. 1) (21.Hall M.A. Xi J.

Chem. 2010; 53: 5667-5675Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Propofol and AziPm are nAChR inhibitors, and photoaffinity labeling of the Torpedo nAChR established propofol-inhibitable photoincorporation of [3H]AziPm into two sites in the TMD as follows: an intrasubunit site in the δ subunit helix bundle, and a site in the ion channel (22.Jayakar S.S.

Propofol and AziPm are also inhibitors of GLIC, and in GLIC crystals propofol binds in the TMD in the intrasubunit pocket formed by the four transmembrane helices (23.Nury H. Van Renterghem C.

Based upon the identification of the GABAAR amino acids photolabeled by [3H]AziPm and the effects of propofol, AziPm, and o-PD on GABAAR photolabeling by [3H]azietomidate and R-[3H]mTFD-MPAB, we found in this study that propofol, AziPm, and o-PD bind in the α1β3 GABAAR to the same intersubunit sites as etomidate and R-mTFD-MPAB, i.e. the homologous sites at the β+-α−, α+-β−, and β+-β− subunit interfaces. We found no evidence of [3H]AziPm photolabeling of GABAAR amino acids that would be located in intrasubunit binding pockets or in the ion channel. Nonradioactive AziPm was synthesized as described (21.Hall M.A. Xi J. Lor C. Dai S. Pearce R. Dailey W.P.

Briefly, membrane fractions containing 6–10 nmol of [3H]muscimol-binding sites, collected from cells growing on 40–60 tissue culture dishes (15 cm), were resuspended at 1 mg of protein/ml and solubilized overnight in 300 ml of a purification buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, pepstatin, chymostatin, and leupeptin (10 µg/ml each), 2 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 2.5 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. Solubilized FLAG-α1β3 GABAARs were purified by elution from an anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin in elution buffer (purification buffer supplemented with 11.5 mm cholate, 0.86 mm asolectin, and 1.5 mm FLAG peptide). For competition photolabeling studies, GABAAR was also purified by solubilization for 2.5 h in purification buffer supplemented with 30 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside followed by elution from the anti-FLAG affinity resin after washing in purification buffer supplemented with 5 mm CHAPS and 0.2 mm asolectin, as described for the α1β3γ2 GABAAR (19.Chiara D.C.

For both protocols, typical purification yields were ∼1.5 nmol of purified receptor (50–60 nm binding sites) in 15–25 ml of elution buffer. For the GABAAR purified in 0.86 mm asolectin, 11.5 mm cholate, IC50 values (total concentration) for inhibition of [3H]azietomidate, R-[3H]mTFD-MPAB, or [3H]AziPm photolabeling were 2–4-fold higher than for GABAAR purified in 0.2 mm asolectin, 5 mm CHAPS. Aliquots of FLAG-α1β3 GABAARs in elution buffer were used for analytical and preparative scale photolabeling (40–80 µl and 1 ml of α1β3 GABAAR, per condition, respectively). Appropriate volumes of radiolabeled, photoreactive anesthetic solutions in methanol were transferred to glass tubes, and solvent was evaporated under an argon stream. Freshly thawed GABAAR in elution buffer was added to the tube, and radioligand was resuspended with gentle vortexing during 30 min on ice to a final [3H]AziPm concentration of ∼5 µm (2.5 µCi per condition) for analytical or ∼10 µm (90 µCi per condition) for preparative scale experiments. GABAAR was equilibrated with [3H]azietomidate or R-[3H]mTFD-MPAB at final concentrations of 0.9 or 1.5 µm, respectively. Receptors were then equilibrated for 10 min with 1 mm GABA before addition of appropriate concentrations of nonradioactive anesthetic. After further incubation on ice for 30 min, the aliquots were transferred to 96-well plastic plates (Corning catalog number 2797) or 3.5-cm diameter plastic Petri dishes (Corning catalog number 3001) for analytical or preparative photolabelings, respectively, and irradiated on ice for 30 min at a distance of 0.5 to 1 cm with a 365 nm lamp (Spectroline Model EN-16, Spectronics Corp, Westbury, NJ). Stock solutions of nonradioactive AziPm (200 mm), propofol (1 m), R-mTFD-MPAB (60 mm), and etomidate (60 mm) were prepared in methanol, and all samples were photolabeled at a methanol concentration of 0.5% (v/v). Following irradiation, samples were mixed with an equal volume of electrophoresis sample buffer (16.Chiara D.C. Dostalova Z. Jayakar S.S. Zhou X. Miller K.W. Cohen J.B.

For analytical scale labeling, samples were loaded onto wells 2 cm deep, 0.8 cm wide, and 0.15 cm thick (sample volume, 150 µl). Preparative scale labeling samples were loaded onto wells 2 cm deep, 11.3 cm wide, and 0.15-cm thick (sample volume, 1.5 ml). Subunits resolved by SDS-PAGE were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain and excised to measure incorporated 3H (for analytical scale experiments) or eluted and digested to generate peptide fragments for sequence analysis. For analytical scale experiments, the excised subunits were incubated overnight with 200 µl of deionized water and 500 µl of TS-2 tissue solubilizer (Research Products), and then 3H incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting after adding 5 ml of Ecoscint A (National Diagnostics). After photolabeling on a preparative scale, GABAAR subunits were recovered from the excised gel bands as described (16.Chiara D.C. Dostalova Z. Jayakar S.S. Zhou X. Miller K.W. Cohen J.B.

Aliquots (∼90 µl) from gel bands enriched in α1 or β3 subunits were digested at room temperature with 0.5 units of EndoLys-C for 14 days or 2.5 µg of EndoGlu-C for 2–4 days, following which the digests were fractionated by HPLC or directly subjected to protein microsequence analysis.

The concentration dependence of inhibition of 3H incorporation into GABAAR subunits was fit by nonlinear least squares using SigmaPlot to a single site model, Equation 1,f(x)=(f0−fns)/(1+x/IC50)+fns(Eq. 1) where f(x) is the 3H counts/min (cpm) incorporated into a subunit at the inhibitor total concentration x; f0 is the subunit 3H in the absence of inhibitor; IC50 is the total inhibitor concentration reducing photolabeling by 50%, and fns is the nonspecific subunit photolabeling. IC50 was the adjustable parameter. For [3H]azietomidate and R-[3H]mTFD-MPAB, fns was the residual subunit photolabeling in the presence of 300 µm etomidate or 2.5 mm pentobarbital, respectively. For [3H]AziPm the fns was determined in the presence of either 300 µm etomidate or R-mTFD-MPAB. Although 3H incorporation was determined separately for the three gel bands, IC50 values were determined for inhibition of [3H]azietomidate photoincorporation in the ∼56-kDa α subunit band that reflects photolabeling of α1Met-236 and for R-[3H]mTFD-MPAB (16.Chiara D.C.

For [3H]AziPm, inhibition of photolabeling was quantified only for the β subunit bands, as pharmacologically specific photolabeling was too small a component of α subunit photolabeling. For GABAAR purified in 0.2 mm asolectin, 5 mm CHAPS, photolabeling in the presence of nonradioactive AziPm at concentrations >30 µm resulted in GABAAR aggregation, as evidenced by decreased stain intensity of GABAAR subunit gel bands after SDS-PAGE. IC50 values for AziPm were determined from data at concentrations ≤30 µm.

https://openalex.org/W2038733101,"The EGF receptor has seven different cognate ligands. Previous work has shown that these different ligands are capable of inducing different biological effects, even in the same cell. To begin to understand the molecular basis for this variation, we used luciferase fragment complementation to measure ligand-induced dimer formation and radioligand binding to study the effect of the ligands on subunit-subunit interactions in EGF receptor (EGFR) homodimers and EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers. In luciferase fragment complementation imaging studies, amphiregulin (AREG) functioned as a partial agonist, inducing only about half as much total dimerization as the other three ligands. However, unlike the other ligands, AREG showed biphasic kinetics for dimer formation, suggesting that its path for EGF receptor activation involves binding to both monomers and preformed dimers. EGF, TGFα, and betacellulin (BTC) appear to mainly stimulate receptor activation through binding to and dimerization of receptor monomers. In radioligand binding assays, EGF and TGFα exhibited increased affinity for EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers compared with EGFR homodimers. By contrast, BTC and AREG showed a similar affinity for both dimers. Thus, EGF and TGFα are biased agonists, whereas BTC and AREG are balanced agonists with respect to selectivity of dimer formation. These data suggest that the differences in biological response to different EGF receptor ligands may result from partial agonism for dimer formation, differences in the kinetic pathway utilized to generate activated receptor dimers, and biases in the formation of heterodimers versus homodimers.

The EGF receptor tyrosine kinase is a classic receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates cell proliferation in response to a variety of different ligands. Structurally, the receptor possesses an extracellular ligand binding domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (1.Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J.

Although this basic pattern of EGF receptor activation is relatively straightforward, a number of variations serve to make the system significantly more complex. The EGF receptor is a member of the ErbB family of homologous receptors that also includes ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (12.Ferguson K.M. Structure-based view of epidermal growth factor receptor regulation.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 353-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The ErbB receptors are structurally similar and exhibit comparable mechanisms of activation (5.Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J.

As a result of these similarities, the ErbB receptors can interact with each other to form heterodimers. Although most combinations of ErbB receptors can form, in general, it appears that ErbB2 is the preferred heterodimerization partner (15.Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E.

Ther. 2009; 122: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For example, in 32D cells expressing the EGF receptor, TGFα and AREG stimulate higher levels of cell proliferation than EGF and heparin-binding EGF (22.Wilson K.J. Mill C. Lambert S. Buchman J.

In human fibroblasts, EGF stimulates cell migration through a mechanism involving p70S6K, whereas TGFα stimulates migration via phospholipase C (23.Ellis I.R. Schor A.M. Schor S.L.

In β-HC9 cells, EGF stimulates MAP kinase activation via ras, whereas BTC-stimulated MAP kinase activation occurs independently of ras (24.Saito T. Okada S. Ohshima K. Yamada E. Sato M. Uehara Y.

In some cases, these differences in biological effects have been correlated with differences in the phosphorylation of specific sites on the C-terminal tail of the EGF receptor (22.Wilson K.J.

However, the molecular basis for these differences remains largely unexplored. In this work, we use luciferase fragment complementation imaging and radioligand binding to probe the interaction of the EGF receptor and ErbB2 subunits after stimulation with EGF, TGFα, BTC, and AREG. The results suggest that differences in ligand-induced receptor-receptor interactions, along with variations in dimerization kinetics, likely contribute to the different biological effects induced by the binding of different growth factors to the EGF receptor. EGF was purchased from Biomedical Technologies. TGFα was from Leinco. Human BTC was from Prospec, and AREG was from Leinco. Antibodies to the EGF receptor, pTyr-845, pTyr-992, pTyr-1045, pTyr-1068, and pTyr-1221 were from Cell Signaling Technology. The antibody against pTyr-1173 was from Thermo Scientific. Antibodies against ErbB2 were from Millipore. FetalPlex was from Gemini Bio-Products. Na125I was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 125I-EGF was synthesized using the method of Doran and Spar (26.Doran D.M. Spar I.L. Oxidative iodine monochloride iodination technique.J. Immunol.

The c'698-EGF receptor fused to the N-terminal half of firefly luciferase (NLuc) or the C-terminal half of luciferase (CLuc) was generated by introducing a BsiWI site into the EGF receptor after Ala-698 in pcDNA3.1 Zeo. The NheI to BsiWI fragment was then isolated and ligated into the pBI Tet vector or pcDNA3.1 Zeo vector cut with BsiWi and NheI and encoding the NLuc or CLuc fragments, respectively. The c'709-ErbB2-NLuc construct was generated in a similar fashion by introducing a BsiWI site into ErbB2 after Ala-709 and ligating an NheI to BsiWI fragment into the pBI Tet vector containing the NLuc fragment. The generation of CHO cells constitutively expressing C-terminally truncated forms of the EGF receptor (after residue 645) or ErbB2 (truncated after residue 678) and fused to the NLuc or CLuc fragments on a Tet-inducible plasmid has been described previously (27.Li Y.

Chem. 2012; 287: 31116-31125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The construction of the kinase-dead K721A-EGFR-NLuc and K721A-EGFR-CLuc cell lines has also been described previously (28.Macdonald-Obermann J.L. Piwnica-Worms D. Pike L.J.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FetalPlex and maintained in an incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. CHO cells were plated into 96-well black-walled dishes 2 days prior to use. Immediately before the assay, cells were transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red but with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated with 0.6 mg/ml D-luciferin for 20 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of growth factor and the start of imaging. Cell radiance (photons/second/centimeter squared/Steradian) was measured every 30 s for 25 min using a cooled charge-coupled device camera and the IVIS50 imaging system. Assays were performed in quintuplicate. Data were fit to single or double exponential model curves using GraphPad Prism 6. Cells constitutively expressing ∼300,000 EGF receptors/cell with ErbB2 on a Tet-inducible promoter were plated onto 6-well dishes 48 h prior to use (27.Li Y. Macdonald-Obermann J. Westfall C.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence or presence of 1 µg/ml doxycycline to induce the expression of ErbB2. This concentration of doxycycline induced the expression of approximately ∼1.5 × 106 ErbB2 molecules/cell. Before use, cells were washed in chilled phosphate-buffered saline and cooled to 4 °C prior to the addition of 30 pm 125I-EGF in Ham's F12 medium containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Increasing concentrations of unlabeled EGF, TGFα, BTC, or AREG were added to the wells in triplicate. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, plates were washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Monolayers were dissolved in 1 ml 1 N NaOH and counted in a Beckman γ counter. Assays were done in triplicate. Data were fit to the equation for log(inhibitor) versus response (variable slope) using GraphPad Prism 6. The significance of the differences between the EC50 values in the absence and presence of ErbB2 was based on the p value assigned to those differences by Prism 6. CHO cells constitutively expressing the EGF receptor and stably transfected with ErbB2 on a Tet-inducible plasmid were plated in 6-well dishes and grown for 2 days before use. When desired, 50 ng/ml doxycycline was added to the growth medium. Immediately before the assay, cells were transferred into warmed Ham's F12 medium containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and stimulated with growth factor for the indicated time. Plates were incubated at 37 °C, and the assay was stopped by washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Monolayers were scraped into the radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and cells were solubilized by passage through a fine-gauge needle. After pelleting unsolubilized material, equal amounts of protein were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were identified by Western blotting. Results were quantitated using ImageJ software. We first compared the biological effects of EGF, TGFα, BTC, and AREG in CHO cells that constitutively expressed ∼300,000 EGF receptors/cell and contained ErbB2 on a tetracycline-inducible promoter. This allowed us to determine the effect of the four different growth factors in cells containing only EGF receptors or in cells containing both the EGF receptor and ErbB2. To compare the biological effects of these four growth factors, CHO cells grown in the absence or presence of doxycycline were stimulated with a saturating concentration of EGF, TGFα, BTC, or AREG and assayed by Western blotting for phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and ErbB2. The Western blot analyses are shown in Fig. 1, A and B, left panels, and are quantitated in the right panels. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, in cells expressing only the EGF receptor, all four ligands stimulated maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor within 2 min. However, EGF, TGFα, and BTC each stimulated about twice as much phosphorylation as AREG. This phosphorylation was transient because it had declined by 5 min after growth factor treatment. The effects of AREG appeared to decline somewhat more slowly than those of the other three growth factors. A similar phenomenon was seen in cells expressing both the EGF receptor and ErbB2 (Fig. 1B). Again, phosphorylation was maximal by 2 min, and EGF, TGFα, and BTC stimulated about twice as much phosphorylation of both the EGF receptor and ErbB2 as AREG. Therefore, AREG is a partial agonist for the phosphorylation of both EGFR homodimers and EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers. Replicate lysates at the 2-min time point in Fig. 1, A and B, were subjected to Western blotting with phosphosite-specific antibodies to determine whether there was differential phosphorylation of sites by the different growth factors. As shown in Fig. 1C, AREG stimulated less phosphorylation than EGF, TGFα, or BTC at essentially all sites on the EGF receptor, except for pTyr-1173. At this site, AREG-stimulated phosphorylation was comparable or higher in EGF receptor homodimers but less in heterodimers compared with the other three growth factors. AREG also stimulated less phosphorylation of ErbB2 at pTyr-1221. These data demonstrate that AREG ultimately induces a quantitatively different biological response than EGF, TGFα, and BTC in these cells. It is possible that this difference in phosphorylation was due to differences in down-regulation of the EGF receptor by the four growth factors. Therefore, we examined the ability of the four different ligands to induce down-regulation of the EGF receptor. Cells were incubated for the indicated times with a saturating dose of the growth factor and then washed with low-pH buffer to remove surface-bound ligand. Residual cell surface EGF receptors were then detected via 125I-EGF binding. As shown in Fig. 2A, in cells expressing only the EGF receptor, all four ligands induced a similar, ∼65% decrease in cell surface EGF receptors over the time course of our assay. Expression of ErbB2 is known to reduce the ligand-stimulated internalization of the EGF receptor (29.Haslekås C. Breen K. Pedersen K.W. Johannessen L.E. Stang E. Madshus I.H. The inhibitory effect of ErbB2 on epidermal growth factor-induced formation of clathrin-coated pits correlates with retention of epidermal growth factor receptor-ErbB2 oligomeric complexes at the plasma membrane.Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8865-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This was apparent in cells expressing both the EGF receptor and ErbB2 (Fig. 2B), where each ligand induced only an ∼30% decrease in cell surface EGF receptors. Because all four ligands appear to induce the same extent of down-regulation in both cell lines, the differences observed in our phosphorylation assays do not appear to be associated with differences in ligand-induced internalization of the EGF receptor. One possible explanation for the partial agonism of AREG in the phosphorylation assay is that it is less effective than the other growth factors at inducing the formation of EGF receptor dimers. We have previously used luciferase fragment complementation assays to measure the formation of EGF receptor homodimers and EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers (31.Macdonald-Obermann J.L. Adak S. Landgraf R. Piwnica-Worms D. Pike L.J. Dynamic analysis of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-ErbB2-ErbB3 protein network by luciferase fragment complementation imaging.J. Biol.

Therefore, we used this method to compare dimer formation induced by the four different ligands. Initially, we performed luciferase fragment complementation imaging using EGF receptors and ErbB2 that had been C-terminally truncated at the end of the transmembrane domain and thus lacked the entire intracellular domain (31.Macdonald-Obermann J.L. Adak S. Landgraf R. Piwnica-Worms D. Pike L.J. Dynamic analysis of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-ErbB2-ErbB3 protein network by luciferase fragment complementation imaging.J. Biol.

Therefore, in these truncated constructs, dimerization was mediated only by interactions between the extracellular and/or transmembrane domains of the receptor subunits. For these experiments, the N-terminal half (NLuc) or C-terminal half (CLuc) of firefly luciferase was fused to the C terminus of the truncated EGFR (ΔC-EGFR) or the truncated ErbB2 (ΔC-ErbB2). A flexible linker was added between the truncated receptor and the NLuc or CLuc fragments to facilitate complementation. The appropriate pairs of receptors were then stably expressed in CHO cells. We first determined the dose response to all four ligands for complementation between ΔC-EGFR-NLuc and ΔC-EGFR-CLuc (Fig. 3). In this system, each ligand stimulated an initial rapid increase in light production, which then slowed toward a plateau after 10–15 min. A similar pattern was observed for complementation between ΔC-ErbB2-NLuc and ΔC-EGFR-CLuc (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Luciferase complementation in CHO cells stably expressing ΔC-EGFR-CLuc and inducible ΔC-ErbB2-NLuc. CHO cells were plated into 96-well dishes and treated with doxycycline to induce the expression of the ΔC-ErbB2-NLuc. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of EGF (A), TGFα (B), BTC (C), or AREG (D) and assayed for luciferase fragment complementation as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On the basis of these dose-response curves, the concentration of each growth factor that gave the highest level of complementation was selected and compared directly with the others in a luciferase complementation assay in cells coexpressing ΔC-EGFR-NLuc and ΔC-EGFR-CLuc (Fig. 5A) or ΔC-ErbB2-NLuc and ΔC-EGFR-CLuc (Fig. 5B). In both the homodimer (Fig. 5A) and the heterodimer (Fig. 5B), stimulation with EGF, TGFα, and BTC induced approximately twice as much complementation as the optimal dose of AREG. This is consistent with the results of the receptor autophosphorylation assays and suggests that the smaller biological effect of AREG may be due to a decreased ability to generate dimerized receptors compared with the other three growth factors. The lower level of dimerization induced by AREG is not simply due to the truncated nature of the receptor in which these assays were done. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, AREG also stimulated lower levels of complementation in homodimers and heterodimers composed of receptors that were truncated after the intracellular juxtamembrane domain of the receptors (c'698-EGFR and c'709-ErbB2), known to form an antiparallel helical dimer (33.Jura N. Endres N.F. Engel K. Deindl S. Das R. Lamers M.H. Wemmer D.E. Zhang X. Kuriyan J.

Furthermore, the same pattern was observed when the full-length, kinase-dead version of the EGF receptor was used (Fig. 6, C and D). Therefore, AREG appears to function as a partial agonist with respect to the induction of dimer formation, regardless of receptor structure. As is apparent from the dose-response curves of AREG in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, at very high doses, the luciferase activity exhibits an unusual rapid rise and fall, followed by a slow rise. This suggests that receptor dimerization involves a multistep proc"

Crystallographic and isothermal titration calorimetry analysis reveals that ydaO binds two molecules of c-di-AMP in binding pockets related by pseudo-two-fold symmetry. The ydaO riboswitch, involved in sporulation, osmotic stress responses and cell wall metabolism, targets the second messenger cyclic-di-AMP with subnanomolar affinity. We have solved the structure of c-di-AMP bound to the Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis ydaO riboswitch, thereby identifying a five-helical scaffold containing a zippered-up bubble, a pseudoknot and long-range tertiary base pairs. Highlights include the identification of two c-di-AMP binding pockets on the same face of the riboswitch, related by pseudo-two-fold symmetry, with potential for cross-talk between sites mediated by adjacently positioned base-stacking alignments connecting pockets. The adenine rings of bound c-di-AMP molecules are wedged between bases and stabilized by stacking, base-sugar and sugar-sugar intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. The structural studies are complemented by isothermal titration calorimetry–based binding studies of mutants mediating key tertiary intermolecular contacts. The T. tengcongensis ydaO riboswitch, like its Bacillus subtilis counterpart, most likely functions through a transcription termination mechanism, with the c-di-AMP bound state representing an 'off' switch."

We report the crystal structures of c-di-AMP riboswitches from Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus and Thermovirga lienii determined at ∼3.0-Å resolution. In both species, the RNA adopts an unforeseen 'square'-shaped pseudosymmetrical architecture that features two three-way junctions, a turn and a pseudoknot, positioned in the square corners. Uncharacteristically for riboswitches, the structure is stapled by two ligand molecules that span the interior of the structure and employ similar noncanonical interactions for RNA recognition. Mutations in either ligand-binding site negatively affect c-di-AMP binding, suggesting that the riboswitch-triggered genetic response requires contribution of both ligands. Our data provide what are to our knowledge the first insights into specific sensing of c-di-AMP and a molecular mechanism underlying the common c-di-AMP-dependent control of essential cellular processes in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2060519709,"Transcriptome analyses have recently identified PARP12, a member of a large family of ADP-ribosyl transferases, as an interferon-induced gene (ISG), whose function remains incompletely characterized. We demonstrate herein that PARP12 is a genuine ISG, whose expressed protein displays at least two distinct subcellular locations and related functions. Upon ectopic expression or exposure to oxidative stress, PARP12 is recruited to stress-granules (SGs), known sites of mRNA translational arrest. Accordingly, PARP12 was found to block mRNA translation, possibly upon association to the translational machinery. Both the N-terminal domain (containing an RNA-binding domain characterized by the presence of five CCCH-type Zn-fingers) and integrity of the catalytic domain are required for this suppressive function. In contrast, stimulation with LPS leads to the localization of PARP12 to p62/SQSTM1 (an adaptor protein involved in innate signaling and autophagy) containing structures, unrelated to SGs. Deletion of the N-terminal domain promotes the association of the protein to p62/SQSTM1, suggesting that the RNA-binding domain is responsible for the subcellular localization of PARP12. Association to p62/SQSTM1 was found to correlate with increased NF-κB signaling, suggesting a role for PARP12 in inflammation. Collectively, these observations suggest that PARP12 can alternate between two distinct subcellular compartments associated to two distinct cellular functions. The present work therefore identifies PARP12 as an ISG with a potential role in cellular defenses against viral infections."

To identify molecular defects that lead to such changes, we focused on the outer retina, in which synapses are markedly altered in old rodents and humans. We found that the serine/threonine kinase LKB1 and one of its substrates, AMPK, regulate this process. In old mice, synaptic remodeling was accompanied by specific decreases in the levels of total LKB1 and active (phosphorylated) AMPK. In the absence of either kinase, young adult mice developed retinal defects similar to those that occurred in old wild-type animals. LKB1 and AMPK function in rod photoreceptors where their loss leads to aberrant axonal retraction, the extension of postsynaptic dendrites and the formation of ectopic synapses. Conversely, increasing AMPK activity genetically or pharmacologically attenuates and may reverse age-related synaptic alterations. Together, these results identify molecular determinants of age-related synaptic remodeling and suggest strategies for attenuating these changes."
https://openalex.org/W2036236740,"The evolution of the cancer cell into a metastatic entity is the major cause of death in patients with cancer. It has been acknowledged that aberrant activation of a latent embryonic program, known as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), can endow cancer cells with the migratory and invasive capabilities associated with metastatic competence for which E-cadherin switch is a well-established hallmark. Discerning the molecular mechanisms that regulate E-cadherin expression is therefore critical for understanding tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Here we report that SMAR1 overexpression inhibits EMT and decelerates the migratory potential of breast cancer cells by up-regulating E-cadherin in a bidirectional manner. While SMAR1-dependent transcriptional repression of Slug by direct recruitment of SMAR1/HDAC1 complex to the matrix attachment region site present in the Slug promoter restores E-cadherin expression, SMAR1 also hinders E-cadherin-MDM2 interaction thereby reducing ubiquitination and degradation of E-cadherin protein. Consistently, siRNA knockdown of SMAR1 expression in these breast cancer cells results in a coordinative action of Slug-mediated repression of E-cadherin transcription, as well as degradation of E-cadherin protein through MDM2, up-regulating breast cancer cell migration. These results indicate a crucial role for SMAR1 in restraining breast cancer cell migration and suggest the candidature of this scaffold matrix-associated region-binding protein as a tumor suppressor."

Direct effects were studied in T37i mouse brown adipocytes and primary cultured murine BAT and inguinal WAT (iWAT) cells. In vivo effects were studied using 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Cold exposure doubled serum ACTH concentrations (P=0.03) and fecal corticosterone excretion (P=0.008). In T37i cells, ACTH dose-dependently increased Ucp1 mRNA (EC50=1.8 nM) but also induced Ucp1 protein content 88% (P=0.02), glycerol release 32% (P=0.03) and uncoupled respiration 40% (P=0.003). In cultured BAT and iWAT, ACTH elevated Ucp1 mRNA by 3-fold (P=0.03) and 3.7-fold (P=0.01), respectively. In T37i cells, corticosterone prevented induction of Ucp1 mRNA and Ucp1 protein by both ACTH and norepinephrine in a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent fashion.

Perinatal exposure to BPA (0.5, 5, or 50 μg/kg/d) from 15th day of gravidity to pups weaning resulted in an increase of anti-OVA IgG titers at all BPA dosages in OVA-tolerized rats, and at 5 μg/kg/d in OVA-immunized rats compared to control rats treated with vehicle. In BPA-treated and OVA-tolerized rats, increased anti-OVA IgG titers were associated with higher IFNγ secretion by the spleen. This result is in accordance with the increase of activated CD4(+)CD44(high)CD62L(low) T lymphocytes observed in spleen of BPA-exposed rats compared to controls. Finally, when BPA-treated OVA-tolerized rats were orally challenged with OVA, colonic inflammation occurred, with neutrophil infiltration, increased IFNγ, and decreased TGFβ. We show that perinatal exposure to BPA altered oral tolerance and immunization to dietary antigens (OVA).

https://openalex.org/W1990044417,"Deletion of the 1.5–3 Mb region of chromosome 22 at locus 11.2 gives rise to the chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), also known as DiGeorge and Velocardiofacial Syndromes. It is the most common micro-deletion disorder in humans and one of the most common multiple malformation syndromes. The syndrome is characterized by a broad phenotype, whose characterization has expanded considerably within the last decade and includes many associated findings such as craniofacial anomalies (40%), conotruncal defects of the heart (CHD; 70–80%), hypocalcemia (20–60%), and a range of neurocognitive anomalies with high risk of schizophrenia, all with a broad phenotypic variability. These phenotypic features are believed to be the result of a change in the copy number or dosage of the genes located in the deleted region. Despite this relatively clear genetic etiology, very little is known about which genes modulate phenotypic variations in humans or if they are due to combinatorial effects of reduced dosage of multiple genes acting in concert. Here, we report on decreased expression levels of genes within the deletion region of chromosome 22, including DGCR8, in peripheral leukocytes derived from individuals with 22q11DS compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we found dysregulated miRNA expression in individuals with 22q11DS, including miR-150, miR-194 and miR-185. We postulate this to be related to DGCR8 haploinsufficiency as DGCR8 regulates miRNA biogenesis. Importantly we demonstrate that the level of some miRNAs correlates with brain measures, CHD and thyroid abnormalities, suggesting that the dysregulated miRNAs may contribute to these phenotypes and/or represent relevant blood biomarkers of the disease in individuals with 22q11DS."
https://openalex.org/W2006843712,"Biogenesis of eukaryotic ribosome is a complex event involving a number of non-ribosomal factors. During assembly of the ribosome, rRNAs are post-transcriptionally modified by 2'-O-methylation, pseudouridylation, and several base-specific modifications, which are collectively involved in fine-tuning translational fidelity and/or modulating ribosome assembly. By mass-spectrometric analysis, we demonstrated that N(4)-acetylcytidine (ac(4)C) is present at position 1773 in the 18 S rRNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, we found an essential gene, KRE33 (human homolog, NAT10), that we renamed RRA1 (ribosomal RNA cytidine acetyltransferase 1) encoding an RNA acetyltransferase responsible for ac(4)C1773 formation. Using recombinant Rra1p, we could successfully reconstitute ac(4)C1773 in a model rRNA fragment in the presence of both acetyl-CoA and ATP as substrates. Upon depletion of Rra1p, the 23 S precursor of 18 S rRNA was accumulated significantly, which resulted in complete loss of 18 S rRNA and small ribosomal subunit (40 S), suggesting that ac(4)C1773 formation catalyzed by Rra1p plays a critical role in processing of the 23 S precursor to yield 18 S rRNA. When nuclear acetyl-CoA was depleted by inactivation of acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACS2), we observed temporal accumulation of the 23 S precursor, indicating that Rra1p modulates biogenesis of 40 S subunit by sensing nuclear acetyl-CoA concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2007002103,"Autophagy is a tightly regulated lysosomal degradation pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stresses. Beclin 1 and its interacting proteins, including the class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase Vps34, play crucial roles in autophagy regulation in mammals. We identified nuclear receptor binding factor 2 (Nrbf2) as a Beclin 1-interacting protein from Becn1(-/-);Becn1-EGFP/+ mouse liver and brain. We also found that Nrbf2-Beclin 1 interaction required the N terminus of Nrbf2. We next used the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line RPE-1 as a model system and showed that transiently knocking down Nrbf2 by siRNA increased autophagic flux under both nutrient-rich and starvation conditions. To investigate the mechanism by which Nrbf2 regulates autophagy, we demonstrated that Nrbf2 interacted and colocalized with Atg14L, suggesting that Nrbf2 is a component of the Atg14L-containing Beclin 1-Vps34 complex. Moreover, ectopically expressed Nrbf2 formed cytosolic puncta that were positive for isolation membrane markers. These results suggest that Nrbf2 is involved in autophagosome biogenesis. Furthermore, we showed that Nrbf2 deficiency led to increased intracellular phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate levels and diminished Atg14L-Vps34/Vps15 interactions, suggesting that Nrbf2-mediated Atg14L-Vps34/Vps15 interactions likely inhibit Vps34 activity. Therefore, we propose that Nrbf2 may interact with the Atg14L-containing Beclin 1-Vps34 protein complex to modulate protein-protein interactions within the complex, leading to suppression of Vps34 activity, autophagosome biogenesis, and autophagic flux. This work reveals a novel aspect of the intricate mechanism for the Beclin 1-Vps34 protein-protein interaction network to achieve precise control of autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2013573262,"OmpF and OmpC porin channels are responsible for the passage of small hydrophilic solutes across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. Although these channels are two of the most extensively studied porin channels, what had yet remained elusive was the reason why OmpC shows markedly lower permeability than OmpF, despite having little difference in its channel size. The OmpC channel, however, is known to contain a larger number of ionizable residues than the OmpF channel. In this study, we examined the channel property of OmpF and OmpC using the intact cell of E. coli, and we found that the permeability of several β-lactams and lactose through OmpC became increased to the level comparable with OmpF with up to 0.3 m salt that may increase the Debye-Hückel shielding or with 2% ethanol or 0.3 m urea that may perturb the short range ordering of water molecules. Replacing 10 pore-lining residues that show different ionization behavior between OmpC and OmpF led to substantial conversion of channel property with respect to their permeability and response to external salt concentration. We thus propose that the overall configuration of ionizable residues in the channel that may orient water molecules and the electrostatic profile of the channel play a decisive role in defining the channel property of the OmpC porin rather than its channel size."
https://openalex.org/W2041616575,"Folate, an important nutrient in the human diet, has been implicated in cancer, but its role in metastasis is not established. We have shown previously that the withdrawal of medium folate leads to the inhibition of migration and invasion of A549 lung carcinoma cells. Here we have demonstrated that medium folate regulates the function of Rho GTPases by enabling their carboxyl methylation and translocation to plasma membrane. Conversely, the lack of folate leads to the retention of these proteins in endoplasmic reticulum. Folate also promoted the switch from inactive (GDP-bound) to active (GTP-bound) GTPases, resulting in the activation of downstream kinases p21-activated kinase and LIM kinase and phosphorylation of the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin. We have further demonstrated that in A549 cells two GTPases, RhoA and Rac1, but not Cdc42, are immediate sensors of folate status: the siRNA silencing of RhoA or Rac1 blocked effects of folate on cofilin phosphorylation and cellular migration and invasion. The finding that folate modulates metastatic potential of cancer cells was confirmed in an animal model of lung cancer using tail vein injection of A549 cells in SCID mice. A folate-rich diet enhanced lung colonization and distant metastasis to lymph nodes and decreased overall survival (35 versus 63 days for mice on a folate-restricted diet). High folate also promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells and experimental mouse tumors. Our study provides experimental evidence for a mechanism of metastasis promotion by dietary folate and highlights the interaction between nutrients and metastasis-related signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2035929695,"Abundant new ichthyosaur material has recently been documented in the Slottsmøya Member of the Agardhfjellet Formation from the Svalbard archipelago of Norway. Here we describe a partial skeleton of a new taxon, Janusaurus lundi, that includes much of the skull and representative portions of the postcranium. The new taxon is diagnosed by a suite of cranial character states including a very gracile stapedial shaft, the presence of a dorsal process on the prearticular and autapomorphic postcranial features such as the presence of an interclavicular trough and a conspicuous anterodorsal process of the ilium. The peculiar morphology of the ilia indicates a previously unrecognized degree of morphological variation in the pelvic girdle of ophthalmosaurids. We also present a large species level phylogenetic analysis of ophthalmosaurids including new and undescribed ichthyosaur material from the Upper Jurassic of Svalbard. Our results recover all Svalbard taxa in a single unresolved polytomy nested within Ophthalmosaurinae, which considerably increases the taxonomic composition of this clade. The paleobiogeographical implications of this result suggest the presence of a single clade of Boreal ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaurs that existed during the latest Jurassic, a pattern also reflected in the high degree of endemicity among some Boreal invertebrates, particularly ammonoids. Recent and ongoing descriptions of marine reptiles from the Slottsmøya Member Lagerstätte provide important new data to test hypotheses of marine amniote faunal turnover at the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2085689390,"Astrocytes and neurons express several large pore (hemi)channels that may open in response to various stimuli, allowing fluorescent dyes, ions, and cytoplasmic molecules such as ATP and glutamate to permeate. Several of these large pore (hemi)channels have similar characteristics with regard to activation, permeability, and inhibitor sensitivity. Consequently, their behaviors and roles in astrocytic and neuronal (patho)physiology remain undefined. We took advantage of the Xenopus laevis expression system to determine the individual characteristics of several large pore channels in isolation. Expression of connexins Cx26, Cx30, Cx36, or Cx43, the pannexins Px1 or Px2, or the purinergic receptor P2X7 yielded functional (hemi)channels with isoform-specific characteristics. Connexin hemichannels had distinct sensitivity to alterations of extracellular Ca(2+) and their permeability to dyes and small atomic ions (conductance) were not proportional. Px1 and Px2 exhibited conductance at positive membrane potentials, but only Px1 displayed detectable fluorescent dye uptake. P2X7, in the absence of Px1, was permeable to fluorescent dyes in an agonist-dependent manner. The large pore channels displayed overlapping sensitivity to the inhibitors Brilliant Blue, gadolinium, and carbenoxolone. These results demonstrated isoform-specific characteristics among the large pore membrane channels; an open (hemi)channel is not a nonselective channel. With these isoform-specific properties in mind, we characterized the divalent cation-sensitive permeation pathway in primary cultured astrocytes. We observed no activation of membrane conductance or Cx43-mediated dye uptake in astrocytes nor in Cx43-expressing C6 cells. Our data underscore that although Cx43-mediated transport is observed in overexpressing cell systems, such transport may not be detectable in native cells under comparable experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1996787077,"The S100P protein is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins and possesses both intracellular and extracellular functions. Extracellular S100P binds to the cell surface receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and activates its downstream signaling cascade to meditate tumor growth, drug resistance and metastasis. Preventing the formation of this S100P-RAGE complex is an effective strategy to treat various disease conditions. Despite its importance, the detailed structural characterization of the S100P-RAGE complex has not yet been reported. In this study, we report that S100P preferentially binds to the V domain of RAGE. Furthermore, we characterized the interactions between the RAGE V domain and Ca2+-bound S100P using various biophysical techniques, including isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence spectroscopy, multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, functional assays and site-directed mutagenesis. The entropy-driven binding between the V domain of RAGE and Ca+2-bound S100P was found to lie in the micromolar range (Kd of ∼6 µM). NMR data-driven HADDOCK modeling revealed the putative sites that interact to yield a proposed heterotetrameric model of the S100P-RAGE V domain complex. Our study on the spatial structural information of the proposed protein-protein complex has pharmaceutical relevance and will significantly contribute toward drug development for the prevention of RAGE-related multifarious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1982205139,"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a ubiquitous and abundant protein that participates in cellular energy production. GAPDH normally exists in a soluble form; however, following necrosis, GAPDH and numerous other intracellular proteins convert into an insoluble disulfide-cross-linked state via the process of ""nucleocytoplasmic coagulation."" Here, free radical-induced aggregation of GAPDH was studied as an in vitro model of nucleocytoplasmic coagulation. Despite the fact that disulfide cross-linking is a prominent feature of GAPDH aggregation, our data show that it is not a primary rate-determining step. To identify the true instigating event of GAPDH misfolding, we mapped the post-translational modifications that arise during its aggregation. Solvent accessibility and energy calculations of the mapped modifications within the context of the high resolution native GAPDH structure suggested that oxidation of methionine 46 may instigate aggregation. We confirmed this by mutating methionine 46 to leucine, which rendered GAPDH highly resistant to free radical-induced aggregation. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that oxidation of methionine 46 triggers a local increase in the conformational plasticity of GAPDH that likely promotes further oxidation and eventual aggregation. Hence, methionine 46 represents a ""linchpin"" whereby its oxidation is a primary event permissive for the subsequent misfolding, aggregation, and disulfide cross-linking of GAPDH. A critical role for linchpin residues in nucleocytoplasmic coagulation and other forms of free radical-induced protein misfolding should now be investigated. Furthermore, because disulfide-cross-linked aggregates of GAPDH arise in many disorders and because methionine 46 is irrelevant to native GAPDH function, mutation of methionine 46 in models of disease should allow the unequivocal assessment of whether GAPDH aggregation influences disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2089989403,"The existing empirical literature suggests that during difficult situations, the concurrent experience of positive and negative affects may be ideal for ensuring successful adaptation and well-being. However, different patterns of mixed emotions may have different adaptive consequences. The present research tested the proposition that experiencing a pattern of secondary mixed emotion (i.e., secondary emotion that embrace both positive and negative affects) more greatly promotes adaptive coping than experiencing two other patterns of mixed emotional experiences: simultaneous (i.e., two emotions of opposing affects taking place at the same time) and sequential (i.e., two emotions of opposing affects switching back and forth). Support for this hypothesis was obtained from two experiments (Studies 1 and 2) and a longitudinal survey (Study 3). The results revealed that secondary mixed emotions predominate over sequential and simultaneous mixed emotional experiences in promoting adaptive coping through fostering the motivational and informative functions of emotions; this is done by providing solution-oriented actions rather than avoidance, faster decisions regarding coping strategies (Study 1), easier access to self-knowledge, and better narrative organization (Study 2). Furthermore, individuals characterized as being prone to feeling secondary mixed emotions were more resilient to stress caused by transitions than those who were characterized as being prone to feeling opposing emotions separately (Study 3). Taken together, the preliminary results indicate that the pattern of secondary mixed emotion provides individuals with a higher capacity to handle adversity than the other two patterns of mixed emotional experience."
https://openalex.org/W2039622537,"The adoption of unrelated orphaned infants is something chimpanzees and humans have in common. Providing parental care has fitness implications for both the adopter and orphan, and cases of adoption have thus been cited as evidence for a shared origin of an altruistic behaviour. We provide new data on adoptions in the free-living Sonso chimpanzee community in Uganda, together with an analysis of published data from other long-term field sites. As a default pattern, we find that orphan chimpanzees do not become adopted by adult group members but wherever possible associate with each other, usually as maternal sibling pairs. This occurs even if both partners are still immature, with older individuals effectively becoming 'child household heads'. Adoption of orphans by unrelated individuals does occur but usually only if no maternal siblings or other relatives are present and only after significant delays. In conclusion, following the loss of their mother, orphaned chimpanzees preferentially associate along pre-existing social bonds, which are typically strongest amongst maternal siblings."

We hypothesized that pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist, would normalize retinal insulin signal transduction through reduced tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) activities in whole retina and retinal endothelial cells (REC) and Müller cells.

Data demonstrate that 2 months of pioglitazone significantly increased electroretinogram amplitudes in type 2 diabetic obese rats, which was associated with improved insulin receptor activation. These changes occurred in both REC and Müller cells treated with pioglitazone, suggesting that these two cell types are key to insulin resistance in the retina.

https://openalex.org/W1971823431,"The ability to osmoregulate is fundamental to life. Adult Drosophila melanogaster maintain hemolymph osmolarity within a narrow range. Osmolarity modulates transepithelial ion and water flux in the Malpighian (renal) tubules of the fly, which are in direct contact with hemolymph in vivo, but the mechanisms causing increased transepithelial flux in response to hypotonicity are unknown. Fly renal tubules secrete a KCl-rich fluid. We have previously demonstrated a requirement for Ncc69, the fly sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter (NKCC), in tubule K(+) secretion. Mammalian NKCCs are regulated by a kinase cascade consisting of the with-no-lysine (WNK) and Ste20-related proline/alanine-rich (SPAK)/oxidative stress response (OSR1) kinases. Here, we show that decreasing Drosophila WNK activity causes a reduction in K(+) flux. Similarly, knocking down the SPAK/OSR1 homolog fray also decreases K(+) flux. We demonstrate that a hierarchical WNK-Fray signaling cascade regulates K(+) flux through Ncc69, because (i) a constitutively active Fray mutant rescues the wnk knockdown phenotype, (ii) Fray directly phosphorylates Ncc69 in vitro, and (iii) the effect of wnk and fray knockdown is abolished in Ncc69 mutants. The stimulatory effect of hypotonicity on K(+) flux is absent in wnk, fray, or Ncc69 mutant tubules, suggesting that the Drosophila WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NKCC cascade is an essential molecular pathway for osmoregulation, through its effect on transepithelial ion flux and fluid generation by the renal tubule."

https://openalex.org/W2087658375,"Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical advantages of medial support screws (MSSs) in the locking proximal humeral plate for treating proximal humerus fractures. Methods Thirty synthetic left humeri were randomly divided into 3 subgroups to establish two-part surgical neck fracture models of proximal humerus. All fractures were fixed with a locking proximal humerus plate. Group A was fixed with medial cortical support and no MSSs; Group B was fixed with 3 MSSs but without medial cortical support; Group C was fixed with neither medial cortical support nor MSSs. Axial compression, torsional stiffness, shear stiffness, and failure tests were performed. Results Constructs with medial support from cortical bone showed statistically higher axial and shear stiffness than other subgroups examined (P<0.0001). When the proximal humerus was not supported by medial cortical bone, locking plating with medial support screws exhibited higher axial and torsional stiffness than locking plating without medial support screws (P≤0.0207). Specimens with medial cortical bone failed primarily by fracture of the humeral shaft or humeral head. Specimens without medial cortical bone support failed primarily by significant plate bending at the fracture site followed by humeral head collapse or humeral head fracture. Conclusions Anatomic reduction with medial cortical support was the stiffest construct after a simulated two-part fracture. Significant biomechanical benefits of MSSs in locking plating of proximal humerus fractures were identified. The reconstruction of the medial column support for proximal humerus fractures helps to enhance mechanical stability of the humeral head and prevent implant failure."

This protective effect is sequence-specific because Lys-48 does not affect TTR aggregation. Lys-35 is part of the TTR basic heparin-binding motif. This glycosaminoglycan blocks the protective effect of Lys-35, probably by neutralization of its side chain positive charge. A K35L mutation emulates this effect and results in the rapid self-assembly of the TTR 26–57 region into amyloid fibrils.

Gatekeeper residues counteract aggregation by the repulsive effect of their charges (Arg, Lys, Asp, and Glu), by the entropic penalty on aggregation due to their large and flexible side chains (Arg and Lys), and by the incompatibility with the β-sheet structure of the aggregates (Pro). The impact of gatekeeper residues on the aggregation tendency of proteins can be large; a single substitution of a hydrophobic residue by a Lys suffices to fully convert a highly aggregation-prone protein into a soluble variant (19.Wang W.

TTR is associated with at least two amyloidoses: senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) and FAP. SSA is caused by massive deposition of aggregates of wild type TTR (WT-TTR), mainly in the heart, whereas FAP is caused by deposition at peripheral nerves and tissues of aggregates that are composed of more than 100 different autosomal TTR variants (20.Westermark P. Sletten K. Johansson B. Cornwell G.G. Fibril in senile systemic amyloidosis is derived from normal transthyretin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

At present, liver transplantation is the only treatment for FAP. Tafamidis, a drug that kinetically stabilizes the TTR tetramer, has been approved in Europe to treat V30M FAP patients. However, little is known about the efficacy of tafamidis in non-V30M FAP as well as in other TTR-related amyloidoses, involving cardiac and neurological manifestations (1.Johnson S.M. Connelly S. Fearns C. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. The transthyretin amyloidoses: from delineating the molecular mechanism of aggregation linked to pathology to a regulatory-agency-approved drug.J. Mol.

Thus, additional studies are necessary to unravel the precise mechanism of TTR aggregation and to develop effective therapies for these pathologies. Here we combined in silico and in vitro analyses to explore whether TTR exploits gatekeeper residues to modulate its propensity to form aggregates, focusing on the predictably amyloidogenic 26–57 stretch comprising strands B, C, and D (Fig. 1, red strands). Several studies have shown that strands C and D participate in the interchain contacts that lead to fibril formation in TTR (27.Palaninathan S.K. Mohamedmohaideen N.N. Snee W.C. Kelly J.W.

Many FAP mutations map to strands C and D, including V30M and L55P, the most widespread and aggressive TTR variants, respectively (30.Murakami T. Atsumi T. Maeda S. Tanase S. Ishikawa K. Mita S.

Despite these features, we show here that, surprisingly, this region displays a low propensity to aggregate in vitro. We identify Lys-35 as a gatekeeper residue responsible for this behavior because the mutation K35L within a synthetic TTR 26–57 peptide or in the complete tetrameric protein yields a large increase in amyloidogenicity. Heparin promotes fibrillation of WT-TTR and co-localizes with the protein in the heart tissue of SSA patients (32.Noborn F. O'Callaghan P. Hermansson E. Zhang X. Ancsin J.B. Damas A.M. Dacklin I.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This proamyloidogenic effect depends on its binding selectively to a basic motif among residues 24–35 of strand B (32.Noborn F.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we show that heparin bypasses the gatekeeping effect of Lys-35. Thus, our results demonstrate that TTR exploits negative design strategies to diminish its intrinsic propensity to aggregate and that perturbation of these protective features can trigger its amyloidogenic potential. The intrinsic aggregation and amyloid formation propensities were evaluated for the wild type TTR sequence and the K35L and K48L variants, either in the context of the complete protein sequence or considering the isolated TTR 26–57-derived peptides. These analyses were performed with the AGGRESCAN, TANGO, and AMYLPRED2 algorithms, employing default settings. The three peptides studied here were purchased from Genemed Synthesis with a purity of 99.9%. The peptide compositions were confirmed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. WT-TTR and the K35L-TTR mutant were expressed and purified as described previously (31.Lashuel H.A. Wurth C. Woo L. Kelly J.W. The most pathogenic transthyretin variant, L55P, forms amyloid fibrils under acidic conditions and protofilaments under physiological conditions.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13560-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by absorbance spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of 7.76 × 104 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. Desired amounts of lyophilized peptides were weighted and dissolved on a known volume of Milli-Q water for preparation of fresh 1 mm stock solutions just before the aggregation experiments. Peptide concentration was also confirmed by spectroscopy, measuring the absorbance of the stock solutions at 280 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 5690 m−1 cm−1. The concentration used for aggregation experiments was 100 µm in all assays. Buffers were named as buffer pH 5.0 (100 mm MES, 100 mm KCl, pH 5.0) and buffer pH 7.5 (50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.5). Samples were incubated without agitation at 25, 37, and 50 °C. The aggregation kinetics were followed by measuring the suspension turbidity (at 330 nm) along the kinetics or at the indicated reaction time points using a UVI-Vis Mini-1240 Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). WT peptide aggregation was also studied in the following buffers: 10 mm HCl, 5 mm SDS (buffer 1); 10% acetonitrile (buffer 2); 50% TFE (buffer 3); 50% DMSO (buffer 4); 10 mm HCl, 20% TFE (buffer 5); 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (buffer 6); and 5 mm Triton X-100 (buffer 7). Th-T binding was used to probe amyloid formation on the samples. Peptide samples were diluted to 5 µm in a Th-T solution in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, resulting in a final Th-T concentration of 20 µm. Excitation was set to 450 nm, whereas emission was collected from 400 to 600 nm. Five individual scans were averaged for each measurement using a K2 spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc.). The intensity of the spectra at 482 nm was used as an indicator of the extent of amyloid material. Specifically, in Figs. 5A and 8B, the suspensions containing the aggregated material (12 or 18 h of aggregation, respectively) were centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 15 min, the pellets were resuspended in buffer, and equal amounts of aggregates were mixed with Th-T to measure binding.FIGURE 8.Heparin-induced aggregation of WT peptide is pH-dependent. A and B, 100 µm WT peptide was allowed to aggregate at 25 °C for 18 h at pH 5.0 (black bars) or pH 7.5 (gray bars) in the absence or presence of heparin (10, 20, or 30 µm as mentioned), and the absorbance at 330 nm (A) or Th-T binding (B) was evaluated.

After 72 h, samples were vortexed, and their turbidity (330 nm) was monitored on a UVI-Vis Mini-1240 Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Samples of the three peptides (WT, K35L, and K48L) were prepared immediately before measurements at a concentration of 100 µm by dissolving the stock solution on buffer pH 5.0 or 7.5. CD spectra were recorded at the indicated times, scanning from 260 to 190 nm on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter thermostated at 25 °C. Each spectrum results from the accumulation of 10 scans. When aggregation of the WT peptide was performed in 10 mm HCl, 5 mm SDS (buffer 1), CD measurements were also collected at the same conditions. Aggregated samples were diluted to 10 µm in Milli-Q water. 5 µl of suspension were absorbed onto 200-mesh carbon-coated copper grids for 5 min and then blotted to remove excess material. Negative staining was performed by adding 5 µl of 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Samples were dried on air for 3 min. The grids were imaged with a Jeol 1200 electron microscope (Jeol Ltd.) operating at a 60 kV acceleration voltage. Samples of K35L peptide fibrils grown in buffer pH 5.0 at 25 °C for 3 h were centrifuged for 15 min at 11,000 rpm. The pellet was carefully resuspended in the same volume of PBS, pH 7.0. Digestion was initiated by adding PK or trypsin at a final concentration of 2 µg/ml. PK proteolysis was stopped after 5, 30, or 60 min by the addition of PMSF to attain a final concentration of 5 mm. 50 µl of the digestion mixture were immediately diluted into 200 µl of PBS, pH 7, containing 9 m urea and incubated for 2 h to allow denaturation of the remaining aggregates. The trypsin reaction was quenched by the addition of 1% TFA. TFA at this concentration is effective in both inactivating this enzyme and completely resolubilizing the remaining aggregates (33.Kheterpal I. Williams A. Murphy C. Bledsoe B. Wetzel R. Structural features of the Aβ amyloid fibril elucidated by limited proteolysis.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11757-11767Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Digestion products were separated by a Superdex peptide (GE Healthcare), and elution was followed by recording absorbance at 214 nm. The resistant core was considered to be a peak for which no change in intensity was detected along the digestion reaction. The peaks were collected, and the solvent was removed by centrifugal evaporation. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 0.1% TFA and further concentrated using ZipTip pipette tips (Millipore). Samples were then mixed with the same volume of α-cyano matrix and spotted immediately for mass spectrometry analysis. Spectra were collected using an Ultraflex Speed MALDI-TOF/TOF system (Bruker Daltonics). Data were extracted and exported using the program mMass. The oligomeric state of K35L peptide at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after initiation of the aggregation reaction in buffer pH 5.0 at 25 °C was evaluated using SEC by injecting 50 µl of each sample onto a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) coupled to a HPLC system (Shimadzu). Sample elution was followed by absorbance at 280 nm. Aggregated samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 11,000 rpm. The resulting pellets were resuspended in D2O and lyophilized overnight. Samples were analyzed by attenuated total reflection-FTIR spectroscopy using a Magna 550 FTIR spectrophotometer (Nicolet) equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride detector. Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained by co-adding 256 interferograms collected with 2 cm−1 resolution and apodized with a Happ-Genzel function. Determination of peak positions and curve fitting were performed with the OMNIC (Nicolet) and GRAMS (Galactic) software, respectively. Integral intensities of the secondary structure elements were calculated by analysis of the amide I vibrational mode of the infrared spectrum. Fourier self-deconvolution of the IR spectra was performed with a resolution enhancement factor of 1.8 and a bandwidth of 15 cm−1. Seeding of the K35L peptide aggregation kinetics were assayed by adding known amounts of nuclei solution (K35L peptide suspension previously aggregated for 20 min at pH 5.0 in buffer pH 5.0 at 25 °C) or 2% (v/v) sonicated mature fibrils to freshly prepared samples of peptide at 100 µm. The percentage of nuclei indicated on the experiments was calculated as v/v. The aggregation kinetics of the K35L peptide under different seeding conditions were followed by recording turbidity at 330 nm over time. The effect of heparin on WT peptide aggregation was evaluated by incubating samples of peptide in buffer pH 5.0 or pH 7.5 in the presence of low molecular weight heparin at 10, 20, or 30 µm final concentration. The peptide concentration was fixed at 100 µm. The aggregation kinetics were followed by recording the turbidity of the samples at 330 nm. A sample of the peptide incubated in the absence of heparin was used as a negative control. In the case of the full-length TTR (WT and K35L, 3.5 µm), 35 µm heparin was employed. Pressure-induced denaturation of WT- and K35L-TTR (full-length proteins) was followed by recording tryptophan emission spectra between 300 and 400 nm after excitation set to 280 nm. Pressure was applied with increments of 200 bars, using a K2 spectrofluorometer (ISS) coupled to a high pressure cell described previously (34.Silva J.L. Villas-Boas M. Bonafe C.F. Meirelles N.C. Anomalous pressure dissociation of large protein aggregates: lack of concentration dependence and irreversibility at extreme degrees of dissociation of extracellular hemoglobin.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15863-15868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For spectrum recording, the sample was allowed to equilibrate for 15 min after each pressurization step. The degree of denaturation of the protein was evaluated using the center of spectral of mass of the tryptophan emission at each pressure. Initially, we incubated the peptide encompassing residues 26–57 of wild type human TTR (WT peptide) at 100 µm in a large variety of experimental conditions, including extreme pH (2.0–12.0), high temperatures (up to 60 °C), and high salt concentrations (up to 500 mm KCl). However, we could not detect any significant peptide aggregation as monitored by light scattering, Th-T binding, or electron microscopy (EM) in any of these conditions (data not shown). To force aggregation of this peptide, we used seven buffers containing different additives (acetonitrile, TFE, SDS, Triton X-100, and DMSO) and monitored the extent of aggregation by turbidity after 120 h (Fig. 2A, inset; see the figure legend for buffer constitution). All of them were effective in inducing peptide aggregation to some extent. However, the most pronounced aggregation effects were observed when the peptide was incubated in the presence of 50% DMSO (buffer 4), 50% TFE (buffer 3), 10% acetonitrile (buffer 2), and 10 mm HCl and 5 mm SDS (buffer 1). The latter condition was chosen for a better characterization of the aggregation process of WT peptide. As seen in Fig. 2A (filled circles), in this condition, aggregation of WT peptide presented a lag phase of ∼8 h in duration followed by an exponential growth phase that levelled off at ∼80 h, when turbidity increased 20-fold. It is interesting to note that a non-ionic surfactant, such as Triton X-100 (buffer 7), did not induce a substantial induction on the aggregation of the WT peptide, which suggests that charged surfactants are necessary for this effect. In order to probe the amyloid character of the detected aggregates of WT peptide in HCl-SDS (buffer 1), aggregation kinetics measuring Th-T were performed (Fig. 2B). For this, peptide aliquots were withdrawn during the aggregation kinetics and mixed with Th-T, and the fluorescence spectra were recorded (Fig. 2B, inset). It is possible to see an increase in fluorescence emission at 482 nm over time, suggesting formation of amyloid aggregates. And, again, a nucleation phase in the first ∼5 h was noticed, followed by an exponential growth phase. We monitored simultaneously the change in the secondary structure content of the peptide using far-UV CD (Fig. 2, C and D). Although the peptide comprises the B, C, and D β-strands in the context of the intact protein, in the absence of additives, it exhibited a main peak at 200 nm, characteristic of an unstructured conformation (filled circles in both panels). The presence of SDS induced a progressive shift of the spectrum toward that of an α-helix, with two negative signals at 208 and 222 nm. This conformational transition was observable immediately after dilution in SDS, indicating a fast induction of α-helical contacts. At later times, 1, 2, and 3 h after dilution, the intensity of these peaks increased (Fig. 2C). Incubation in this buffer for 24 h resulted in a dramatic shift in the spectrum, which now presented a single intense negative peak at 216 nm, indicating a transition toward formation of β-sheet-enriched conformations (Fig. 2D). The negative intensity of this peak continued to increase after 48 and 72 h. We used TEM to confirm the morphological properties of the aggregates formed upon incubation for 3, 5, 10, 24, and 72 h and 21 days in SDS (Fig. 2, E–J, respectively). After 3 h of aggregation (nucleation phase, where α-helical species are present"

Human induced pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into endodermal cells in the presence of activin A and then into hepatic progenitor cells using dimethyl sulfoxide. Hepatic progenitor cells were matured in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor, oncostatin M, and dexamethasone with valproic acid that was added during the maturation process. After 25 days of differentiation, cells expressed hepatic marker genes and drug-metabolizing enzymes and exhibited drug-metabolizing enzyme activities. These expression levels and activities were increased by treatment with valproic acid, the timing and duration of which were important parameters to promote differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatic progenitor cells into hepatocytes. Valproic acid inhibited histone deacetylase activity during differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells, and other histone deacetylase inhibitors also enhanced differentiation into hepatocytes. In conclusion, histone deacetylase inhibitors such as valproic acid can be used to promote hepatic differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatic progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065877720,"Chlamydia (C.) pecorum, an obligate intracellular bacterium, may cause severe diseases in ruminants, swine and koalas, although asymptomatic infections are the norm. Recently, we identified genetic polymorphisms in the ompA, incA and ORF663 genes that potentially differentiate between high-virulence C. pecorum isolates from diseased animals and low-virulence isolates from asymptomatic animals. Here, we expand these findings by including additional ruminant, swine, and koala strains. Coding tandem repeats (CTRs) at the incA locus encoded a variable number of repeats of APA or AGA amino acid motifs. Addition of any non-APA/AGA repeat motif, such as APEVPA, APAVPA, APE, or APAPE, associated with low virulence (P<10−4), as did a high number of amino acids in all incA CTRs (P = 0.0028). In ORF663, high numbers of 15-mer CTRs correlated with low virulence (P = 0.0001). Correction for ompA phylogram position in ORF663 and incA abolished the correlation between genetic changes and virulence, demonstrating co-evolution of ompA, incA, and ORF663 towards low virulence. Pairwise divergence of ompA, incA, and ORF663 among isolates from healthy animals was significantly higher than among strains isolated from diseased animals (P≤10−5), confirming the longer evolutionary path traversed by low-virulence strains. All three markers combined identified 43 unique strains and 4 pairs of identical strains among all 57 isolates tested, demonstrating the suitability of these markers for epidemiological investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2046352631,"Mdm4, a protein related to the ubiquitin-ligase Mdm2, is an essential inhibitor of tumor suppressor protein p53. In both human and mouse cells, the Mdm4 gene encodes two major transcripts: one encodes the full-length oncoprotein (designated below as Mdm4-FL), whereas the other, resulting from a variant splicing that skips exon 6, encodes the shorter isoform Mdm4-S. Importantly, increased Mdm4-S mRNA levels were observed in several human cancers, and correlated with poor survival. However, the role of Mdm4-S in cancer progression remains controversial, because the Mdm4-S protein appeared to be a potent p53 inhibitor when overexpressed, but the splice variant also leads to a decrease in Mdm4-FL expression. To unambiguously determine the physiological impact of the Mdm4-S splice variant, we generated a mouse model with a targeted deletion of the Mdm4 exon 6, thereby creating an obligatory exon skipping. The mutant allele (Mdm4ΔE6) prevented the expression of Mdm4-FL, but also led to increased Mdm4-S mRNA levels. Mice homozygous for this allele died during embryonic development, but were rescued by a concomitant p53 deficiency. Furthermore in a hypomorphic p53ΔP/ΔP context, the Mdm4ΔE6 allele led to p53 activation and delayed the growth of oncogene-induced tumors. We next determined the effect of Mdm4+/ΔE6 heterozygosity in a hypermorphic p53+/Δ31 genetic background, recently shown to be extremely sensitive to Mdm4 activity. Mdm4+/ΔE6 p53+/Δ31 pups were born, but suffered from aplastic anemia and died before weaning, again indicating an increased p53 activity. Our results demonstrate that the main effect of a skipping of Mdm4 exon 6 is not the synthesis of the Mdm4-S protein, but rather a decrease in Mdm4-FL expression. These and other data suggest that increased Mdm4-S mRNA levels might correlate with more aggressive cancers without encoding significant amounts of a potential oncoprotein. Hypotheses that may account for this apparent paradox are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1994680268,"An individual-tree diameter growth model was developed for Cunninghamia lanceolata in Fujian province, southeast China. Data were obtained from 72 plantation-grown China-fir trees in 24 single-species plots. Ordinary non-linear least squares regression was used to choose the best base model from among 5 theoretical growth equations; selection criteria were the smallest absolute mean residual and root mean square error and the largest adjusted coefficient of determination. To account for autocorrelation in the repeated-measures data, we developed one-level and nested two-level nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models, constructed on the selected base model; the NLME models incorporated random effects of the tree and plot. The best random-effects combinations for the NLME models were identified by Akaike's information criterion, Bayesian information criterion and −2 logarithm likelihood. Heteroscedasticity was reduced with two residual variance functions, a power function and an exponential function. The autocorrelation was addressed with three residual autocorrelation structures: a first-order autoregressive structure [AR(1)], a combination of first-order autoregressive and moving average structures [ARMA(1,1)] and a compound symmetry structure (CS). The one-level (tree) NLME model performed best. Independent validation data were used to test the performance of the models and to demonstrate the advantage of calibrating the NLME models."
https://openalex.org/W2066769585,"The 14-3-3 protein family comprises adaptors and scaffolds that regulate intracellular signaling pathways. The 14-3-3γ isoform is a negative regulator of steroidogenesis that is hormonally induced and transiently functions at the initiation of steroidogenesis by delaying maximal steroidogenesis in MA-10 mouse tumor Leydig cells. Treatment of MA-10 cells with the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), which stimulates steroidogenesis, triggers the interaction of 14-3-3γ with the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) in the cytosol, limiting STAR activity to basal levels. Over time, this interaction ceases, allowing for a 2-fold induction in STAR activity and maximal increase in the rate of steroid formation. The 14-3-3γ/STAR pattern of interaction was found to be opposite that of the 14-3-3γ homodimerization pattern. Phosphorylation and acetylation of 14-3-3γ showed similar patterns to homodimerization and STAR binding, respectively. 14-3-3γ Ser58 phosphorylation and 14-3-3γ Lys49 acetylation were blocked using trans-activator of HIV transcription factor 1 peptides coupled to 14-3-3γ sequences containing Ser58 or Lys49. Blocking either one of these modifications further induced 8-Br-cAMP-induced steroidogenesis while reducing lipid storage, suggesting that the stored cholesterol is used for steroid formation. Taken together, these results indicate that Ser58 phosphorylation and Lys49 acetylation of 14-3-3γ occur in a coordinated time-dependent manner to regulate 14-3-3γ homodimerization. 14-3-3γ Ser58 phosphorylation is required for STAR interactions under control conditions, and 14-3-3γ Lys49 acetylation is important for the cAMP-dependent induction of these interactions. The 14-3-3 protein family comprises adaptors and scaffolds that regulate intracellular signaling pathways. The 14-3-3γ isoform is a negative regulator of steroidogenesis that is hormonally induced and transiently functions at the initiation of steroidogenesis by delaying maximal steroidogenesis in MA-10 mouse tumor Leydig cells. Treatment of MA-10 cells with the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), which stimulates steroidogenesis, triggers the interaction of 14-3-3γ with the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) in the cytosol, limiting STAR activity to basal levels. Over time, this interaction ceases, allowing for a 2-fold induction in STAR activity and maximal increase in the rate of steroid formation. The 14-3-3γ/STAR pattern of interaction was found to be opposite that of the 14-3-3γ homodimerization pattern. Phosphorylation and acetylation of 14-3-3γ showed similar patterns to homodimerization and STAR binding, respectively. 14-3-3γ Ser58 phosphorylation and 14-3-3γ Lys49 acetylation were blocked using trans-activator of HIV transcription factor 1 peptides coupled to 14-3-3γ sequences containing Ser58 or Lys49. Blocking either one of these modifications further induced 8-Br-cAMP-induced steroidogenesis while reducing lipid storage, suggesting that the stored cholesterol is used for steroid formation. Taken together, these results indicate that Ser58 phosphorylation and Lys49 acetylation of 14-3-3γ occur in a coordinated time-dependent manner to regulate 14-3-3γ homodimerization. 14-3-3γ Ser58 phosphorylation is required for STAR interactions under control conditions, and 14-3-3γ Lys49 acetylation is important for the cAMP-dependent induction of these interactions. The 14-3-3 protein family consists of adaptors and scaffolds that regulate cellular pathways by affecting signal transduction and protein localization and by altering protein modifications. Seven isoforms of the 14-3-3 family are expressed in mammalian cells. All of the isoforms are highly helical because the 14-3-3 monomers contain nine α-helices. The N termini of 14-3-3 proteins contain the dimerization domain where salt bridges form between two monomers to form a dimer. The affinity of 14-3-3 isoforms for homo/heterodimerization varies, but each 14-3-3 isoform exhibits strong preference for dimer formation (1.Aitken A. Baxter H. Dubois T. Clokie S. Mackie S.

Mutational analysis was performed to identify critical residues for protein dimerization and target binding within the 14-3-3 structure, and the results suggested that if the target protein contains more than one suboptimal 14-3-3 motif the affinity of 14-3-3 for the target is increased by 30-fold, which can permit interactions of the monomeric version with its targets (23.Yaffe M.B.

Cholesterol is metabolized in the inner mitochondrial membrane by CYP11A1 to pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroids (26.Aghazadeh Y. Rone M.B. Blonder J. Ye X. Veenstra T.D. Hales D.B. Culty M. Papadopoulos V. Hormone-induced 14-3-3γ adaptor protein regulates steroidogenic acute regulatory protein activity and steroid biosynthesis in MA-10 Leydig cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 15380-15394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is at the transduceosome where the hormone-induced steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) accelerates cholesterol import into mitochondria (27.Liu J. Rone M.B. Papadopoulos V. Protein-protein interactions mediate mitochondrial cholesterol transport and steroid biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38879-38893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We recently reported that STAR is a target of the 14-3-3γ isoform (26.Aghazadeh Y. Rone M.B.

Chem. 2012; 287: 15380-15394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). STAR contains three suboptimal 14-3-3 motifs on critical structure sites and therefore binds 14-3-3γ monomers with high affinity. 14-3-3γ and STAR have similar transcription and translation profiles in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells (26.Aghazadeh Y.

This compound is used to mimic endogenous cAMP, the secondary messenger of gonadotropin luteinizing hormone and the main activator of Leydig cell steroidogenesis. cAMP treatment also disrupted 14-3-3γ dimers, and the monomeric form went on to interact with a serine residue (Ser194) on STAR (28.Papadopoulos V. Liu J. Culty M. Is there a mitochondrial signaling complex facilitating cholesterol import?.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 265–266: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This residue is a phosphorylation site for PKA. STAR phosphorylation at Ser194 induces STAR activity by 2-fold, which is required for maximal steroidogenesis. Ser194 mutations are one of the causes of congenital adrenal lipoid hyperplasia, a condition in which a lack of sufficient steroidogenesis causes cholesterol accumulation and adrenal cortex cells undergo hyperplasia and apoptosis (26.Aghazadeh Y. Rone M.B. Blonder J. Ye X. Veenstra T.D. Hales D.B. Culty M. Papadopoulos V.

Chem. 2012; 287: 15380-15394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By locking phosphorylation of this site, 14-3-3γ is able to retain STAR in the cytosol under basal activity, thus delaying its effect on mitochondrial steroidogenesis. After 2 h, 14-3-3γ dissociates from STAR and homodimerizes, allowing STAR to induce steroidogenesis at a maximal rate (29.Arakane F. King S.R. Du Y. Kallen C.B. Walsh L.P. Watari H. Stocco D.M.

As STAR binding and 14-3-3γ homodimerization have opposite patterns, we sought to identify potential regulatory mechanisms for the time-sensitive function of 14-3-3γ in steroidogenesis. PTMs of 14-3-3 proteins are important regulators of their functions. Phosphorylation can lead to self-dimerization (26.Aghazadeh Y. Rone M.B. Blonder J. Ye X. Veenstra T.D. Hales D.B. Culty M.

For instance, Ser58 phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ, -β, and -η by PKA leads to interactions with sphingosine (31.Shen Y.H. Godlewski J. Bronisz A. Zhu J. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Tzivion G.

Such a PTM was not identified in 14-3-3γ or -β. Indeed, acetylation of key lysine residues in vivo indicates a novel regulatory mechanism of 14-3-3 function as this residue is located in the 14-3-3 monomer amphipathic groove through which they bind to their targets. Furthermore, Uhart and Bustos (13.Chaudhri M. Scarabel M. Aitken A. Mammalian and yeast 14-3-3 isoforms form distinct patterns of dimers in vivo.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) reported cross-talk between 14-3-3 protein acetylation and phosphorylation in which acetylation of 14-3-3ϵ on Lys49 inhibits the phosphorylation-dependent interactions of this protein with specific targets (35.Uhart M.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of 14-3-3γ acetylation and/or phosphorylation on STAR binding and 14-3-3γ homodimerization during steroidogenesis. MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells (kindly provided by Dr. M. Ascoli, University of Iowa) were maintained in DMEM/Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 5% FBS, 2.5% horse serum, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C and 3.7% CO2. For the time course experiments, cells were incubated in serum-free medium and supplemented with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP (Enzo Life Sciences). The time course treatment was carried out for 30, 60, or 120 min as indicated in the figures. When the trans-activator of transcription protein (TAT) peptide was used, 1 × 103 MA-10 cells were cultured, and after 24 h, the medium was replaced by DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 without serum supplemented with 250 nm TAT peptide for 90 min. Progesterone or testosterone levels were measured by RIA in triplicate using specific antibodies against rabbit and sheep, respectively (MP Biomedicals), and a β counter (LS5801, Beckman Coulter). Protein levels in each well were measured with 1 n NaOH extraction buffer and the Bradford dye assay (Bio-Rad) using a Beckman Coulter spectrophotometer. MA-10 cells (6 × 105/well) were cultured in 6-well gelatin-coated plates in triplicate for 24 h. A cAMP time course treatment was carried out. Cells were washed twice in 4 ml of 1× PBS and harvested. Proteins were extracted using radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), and concentrations were measured using the Bradford dye assay (Bio-Rad) and a Beckman spectrophotometer. MA-10 cell lysate was extracted, and 15 µg of lysate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0; 0.20 ml) containing 1.0 mm MgCl2, 50 µg of protein, and 3.3 units of calf alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs). The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli loading buffer at room temperature. Samples were store at −20 °C until further use. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were prepared using 8.2% acrylamide and 25 nm phosphate-binding tag (phos-tag; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) after optimization. Samples were solubilized in Laemmli buffer, heated at 65 °C for 5–10 min, and loaded directly onto phos-tag acrylamide gels. Proteins were separated at 90 V for 3.5 h. The gels were then washed in wash buffer containing 10 mm EDTA to remove the phos-tags for 20 min and then with wash buffer without EDTA for 10 min and electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked using 10% milk and blotted with a 1:1000 dilution of 14-3-3γ-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. The following day, the membranes were washed with 1× Tween 20-TBS twice at room temperature and incubated with secondary anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h with shaking at room temperature to detect 14-3-3γ. Membranes were developed using ECL streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (GE Healthcare) and a luminescent image analyzer (LAS-4000, GE Healthcare). MA-10 cells (1 × 106/Petri dish) were plated in gelatin-coated 100-mm Petri cell culture dishes overnight to reach 90% confluence. Medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's limiting medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 105 mg/liter photo-leucine and 30 mg/liter photo-methionine (Thermo Scientific). Cells were incubated for 22 h followed by cAMP time course treatment. Medium was decanted and replaced with 4 ml of 1× PBS. Cross-linking was performed immediately using a 3UV lamp (UVP, LLC) for 16 min at 365 nm at a distance of 1 cm from the Petri dish surfaces. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using a Dynabeads Co-Immunoprecipitation kit (Invitrogen). The antibody coupling process was performed using anti-acetyl-lysine or anti-phosphoserine (both from Abcam) antibodies following the manufacturer's recommendations, which yielded 10 mg/ml antibody-coupled beads. Cross-linked protein lysates of MA-10 cells were harvested according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Proteins were collected in extraction buffer A (containing 1× immunoprecipitation buffer, 1 m NaCl, and protease inhibitor tablets without EDTA), and 0.2 mg of protein was precipitated with 150 µl of 10 mg/ml antibody-coupled beads rotating at 4 °C for 1 h. MA-10 cells were subjected to 8-Br-cAMP treatment for different time points as indicated in the figures. Cell lysates were pulled down during co-immunoprecipitation using 14-3-3γ antibody. Samples were subjected to 65 °C heat for 10 min to dissociate the protein complexes and then separated on phos-tag gels, which were processed with silver staining according to the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen). Lanes/bands corresponding to different time points of cAMP treatment were cut out, subjected to in-gel digestion, and analyzed via mass spectrometry. Briefly, nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography was performed with an Agilent 1100 LC system (Agilent Technologies) coupled online to a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, Thermo Scientific). Reversed-phase separations were in 75-µm-inner diameter × 360-µm-outer diameter × 10-cm-long capillary columns (Polymicro Technologies Inc.) that were slurry-packed in house with a 5-µm, 300-Å pore size Jupiter C18 silica bonded stationary phase (Phenomenex Torrance). We injected 5 µl of sample into the column over 20 min with 98% solvent A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water). Elution was performed using a linear gradient of 2% solvent B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in 100% acetonitrile) to 85% solvent B for 110 min at a constant flow rate of 250 nl/min. Each full MS scan was followed by seven MS/MS scans, and the most abundant peptide molecular ions were dynamically selected for collision-induced dissociation using a normalized collision energy of 36%. The collision-induced dissociation spectra were searched against a non-redundant human protein database using SEQUEST (Thermo Scientific). MA-10 cell lysates were cross-linked and harvested. A sample of the lysate was kept as a control, whereas the rest was subjected to precipitation with 14-3-3γ antibody. The samples were then separated by 8.25% phos-tag acrylamide electrophoresis as described above. The corresponding bands of each sample at different molecular weights were cut and silver-stained (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's manual and analyzed via mass spectrometry as described previously (13.Chaudhri M. Scarabel M. Aitken A. Mammalian and yeast 14-3-3 isoforms form distinct patterns of dimers in vivo.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The membranes were stripped using 8 ml of Restore Plus Western blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific) and reblotted using a 1:1000 dilution of cytochrome c oxidase IV antibody (Abcam). MA-10 cells (1 × 103/well) were cultured in 96-well glass bottom dishes (Fluorodish, World Precision Instruments) in triplicate and incubated overnight. Cells were treated in a time course manner with cAMP as described above. Cells were fixed using 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min in 37 °C, washed with 1× PBS twice at room temperature, and permeabilized with 10% Triton X-100 for 1 min at room temperature. In-cell IP was performed using the Duolink II Red Starter kit (Olink Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Primary antibodies were used in combinations of 14-3-3γ (anti-mouse and anti-rabbit, 1:150 dilutions; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 14-3-3γ (anti-mouse, 1:150 dilution), and STAR (anti-rabbit, 1:150 dilution; kindly provided by Dr. B.

https://openalex.org/W2094677107,"Cdc42 effector protein-4 (CEP4) was recently identified by our laboratory to be a substrate of multiple PKC isoforms in non-transformed MCF-10A human breast cells. The significance of phosphorylated CEP4 to PKC-stimulated motility of MCF-10A cells was evaluated. Single site mutants at Ser residues embedded in potential PKC consensus sites (Ser18, Ser77, Ser80, and Ser86) were individually replaced with Asp residues to simulate phosphorylation. Following expression in weakly motile MCF-10A cells, the S18D and S80D mutants each promoted increased motility, and the double mutant (S18D/S80D) produced a stronger effect. MS/MS analysis verified that Ser18 and Ser80 were directly phosphorylated by PKCα in vitro. Phosphorylation of CEP4 severely diminished its affinity for Cdc42 while promoting Rac activation and formation of filopodia (microspikes). In contrast, the phosphorylation-resistant double mutant S18A/S80A-CEP4 blocked CEP4 phosphorylation and inhibited motility of MCF-10A cells that had been stimulated with PKC activator diacylglycerol lactone. In view of the dissociation of phospho-CEP4 from Cdc42, intracellular binding partners were explored by expressing each CEP4 double mutant from a tandem affinity purification vector followed by affinity chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and identification of protein bands evident only with S18D/S80D-CEP4. One binding partner was identified as tumor endothelial marker-4 (TEM4; ARHGEF17), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is involved in migration. In motile cells expressing S18D/S80D-CEP4, knockdown of TEM4 inhibited both Rac activation and motility. These findings support a model in which PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CEP4 at Ser18 and Ser80 causes its dissociation from Cdc42, thereby increasing its affinity for TEM4 and producing Rac activation, filopodium formation, and cell motility.

Protein kinase C (PKC) and its substrates participate in signaling pathways in human breast cells that are associated with cancer-related phenotypes (1.Lønne G.K. Cornmark L. Zahirovic I.O.

In non-transformed MCF-10A human breast cells, PKC signaling pathways produce rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, increased microtubule dynamics, and activation of Rac, one of the small Rho GTPases (2.Larsson C.

These pleiotropic responses impact cell morphology, proliferation, and migration, which are collectively associated with tumor growth and metastasis. The frequently observed interplay of PKC with the small Rho GTPases and their effector proteins and regulatory enzymes, e.g. guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 3The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorCEPCdc42 effector proteinVCvector controlDAGdiacylglycerolTEM4tumor endothelial marker-4PARD6Gpartition-defective protein 6GMS/MStandem mass spectroscopyTAPtandem affinity purificationCRIBCdc42/Rac interaction bindingD/DS18D/S80DA/AS18A/S80ASCscrambled control. and GTPase-activating proteins (5.Chen X.

GTPase-activating proteins and GEFs enable the small GTPases to cycle between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states. Investigation of PKC substrates and their interactions with the small GTPases and their regulatory enzymes is a promising strategy for identifying potential targets for anticancer drugs (8.Teicher B.A. Protein kinase C as a therapeutic target.Clin.

PKC is expressed as multiple isoforms that can select specific substrates as well as shared substrates. The isoforms are subcategorized by the nature of their regulation: the conventional isoforms (α, β1/β2, and γ) are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ca2+, the novel isoforms (δ, ϵ, η, and θ) are activated only by DAG, and the atypical isoforms (λ/ι and ζ) are activated by other lipids (e.g. ceramide) (10.Steinberg S.F. Structural basis of protein kinase C isoform function.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 1341-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). PKC α and δ isoforms were shown previously to promote cancer-related phenotypes (11.McCracken M.A. Miraglia L.J. McKay R.A. Strobl J.S. Protein kinase Cδ is a prosurvival factor in human breast tumor cell lines.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 273-281PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Serova M. Ghoul A. Benhadji K.A. Cvitkovic E. Faivre S. Calvo F. Lokiec F. Raymond E. Preclinical and clinical development of novel agents that target the protein kinase C family.Semin. Oncol. 2006; 33: 466-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is noted that a given cell line or tissue will express a characteristic PKC isoform profile that includes some, but usually not all, of these isoforms. For example, MCF-10A cells express low levels of α, δ, θ, and ζ. The traceable kinase method has been very useful in identifying PKC substrates as it provides a means to track the phosphorylated proteins produced by a specific PKC isoform that had been genetically engineered to bind an unnatural ATP analog (13.Shah K. Liu Y. Deirmengian C. Shokat K.M. Engineering unnatural nucleotide specificity for Rous sarcoma virus tyrosine kinase to uniquely label its direct substrates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3565-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 14.Abeyweera T.P. Rotenberg S.A. Design and characterization of a traceable protein kinase C-α.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). MCF-10A cells provide a suitable system for this approach because the endogenous PKC isoforms are expressed at low levels, thereby producing a low background against which the products of the traceable mutant can be detected. Our laboratory investigated substrates of three traceable PKC isoforms (α, δ, and ζ) in MCF-10A cells (5.Chen X. Zhao X. Abeyweera T.P. Rotenberg S.A. Analysis of substrates of protein kinase C isoforms in human breast cells by the traceable kinase method.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 7087-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Findings identified similar protein phosphorylation profiles for α and δ, whereas that for ζ was radically different. Following MS/MS of selected bands, it was found that the α and δ isoforms were associated with a number of Rho GTPase effectors and regulatory proteins, including a protein identified as Cdc42 effector protein-4 (CEP4). Upon further evaluation in vitro with highly pure, recombinant CEP4 and PKC isoforms as well as in cells treated with isoform-specific shRNA reagents, CEP4 proved to be a substrate for all of them. These findings prompted the speculation that individual PKC isoforms may respond to specific stimuli but upon activation may share common protein substrates that relate to a specific phenotype. CEP4, also known as binder of Rho GTPases-4, is one of five related isoforms, CEPs 1–5 (15.Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. The Borgs, a new family of cdc42 and TC10 GTPase-interacting proteins.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and is expressed ubiquitously in all human adult tissues (16.Osada N. Kusuda J. Suzuki Y. Sugano S. Hashimoto K. Sequence analysis, gene expression, and chromosomal assignment of mouse Borg4 gene and its human orthologue.J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 45: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The existence of this family was discovered as the result of a two-hybrid screen with the GTPase TC10 as bait (15.Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. The Borgs, a new family of cdc42 and TC10 GTPase-interacting proteins.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Consequently, all five CEPs were found to bind with high affinity to the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 but did not bind to the other small GTPases (Rac and RhoA) (15.Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G.

Site-specific mutagenesis established that Cdc42 binds to CEP at its 16-amino acid Cdc42/Rac interaction binding (CRIB) domain (15.Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G.

MSE55, a Cdc42 effector protein, induces long cellular extensions in fibroblasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the limited published research available on CEPs, the phenotypes associated with these proteins depend on formation of the CEP·Cdc42 complex and its role in actin-based membrane protrusions (e.g. pseudopodia), actin filament assembly, and cell-cell contacts. There is one example of CEP3 acting independently of Cdc42 in which it associated with a septin GTPase (19.Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Sheffield P.J. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Haystead T. Macara I.G. Borg proteins control septin organization and are negatively regulated by Cdc42.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This protein forms multimeric complexes and has been implicated in cytokinesis, cell polarity, and oncogenesis. Binding of CEP3 to septins disrupted their oligomeric organization. However, this effect by CEP3 was blocked when GTP-Cdc42 was overexpressed, thus providing an example of negative regulation of CEP3 by Cdc42 (19.Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Sheffield P.J. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Haystead T. Macara I.G. Borg proteins control septin organization and are negatively regulated by Cdc42.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the present work, CEP4 was further investigated as a PKC substrate as well as for the functional consequences of its phosphorylation. By use of site-specific mutagenesis at PKC consensus sites as well as tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of CEP4 phosphorylated by PKCα in vitro, key sites of phosphorylation in CEP4 were defined. Site-directed mutants of CEP4 were used to explore the significance of phosphorylation to its interaction with Cdc42, its binding interactions with other proteins, its effects on the actin cytoskeleton, and its role in cell motility. Overall, these studies establish phosphorylated CEP4 as a component of the PKC-mediated motility signaling pathway and as a modulator of actin-based membrane protrusions.

Cell lysis buffer, phospho-PKC substrate antibody, and the myc tag antibody were acquired from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Partition-defective protein 6G (ParD6G) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). TEM4 antibody and pure, recombinant CEP4 were purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Pure, recombinant PKCα was obtained from Fitzgerald Industries International (North Acton, MA). The DAG-lactone reagent (JH-131E-153) was a gift from Dr. V. Marquez (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Human CEP4 cDNA was restricted at SgfI and MluI sites in the pCMV6 plasmid. Expression from this plasmid conferred DDK and myc epitope tags at the C terminus of the recombinant protein. By use of PCR, the cDNA insert was amplified with suitable primers for subcloning into the TAP vector (Agilent Technologies) at BamHI and EcoRV restriction sites. The TEM4 shRNA or scrambled control shRNA each was co-expressed with GFP from a bicistronic vector for evaluation of transfection efficiency. Substitution of the Ser (S) codons in CEP4 cDNA with either Asp (D) or Ala (A) codons was carried out by the QuikChange method using PCR with two mutagenesis primers (Invitrogen) that were designed to introduce the desired mutation. In the following (forward) primers used for single or double substitutions, the changed codon is underlined: S18D, 5′-CAC-TCC-AAG-CGC-CGT-GAC-CGA-GCG-GAC-CTC-ACG-3′; S77D, 5′-TCA-TCT-TCC-AAA-CGC-GAC-CTC-CTG-TCC-AGG-AAG-3′; S80D, 5′-AAA-CGC-AGT-CTC-CTG-GAC-AGG-AAG-TTC-CGG-GGC-3′; S86D, 5′-AGG-AAG-TTC-CGG-GGC-GAC-AAG-CGG-TCA-CAG-TCG-3′; S18A, 5′-CAC-TCC-AAG-CGC-CGT-GCC-CGA-GCG-GAC-CTC-ACG-3′; and S80A, 5′-AAA-CGC-AGT-CTC-CTG-GCC-AGG-AAG-TTC-CGG-GGC-3′. All mutant sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire open reading frame (Macrogen Inc., Rockville, MD). MCF-10A cells were grown in 10-cm or 60-mm BD Falcon culture dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.2% Fungizone, 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 100 ng/ml cholera toxin. Cells were replated 1 day prior to transfection so that the cell density was 80%. The medium was replaced with fresh complete medium 1 h before transfection. Plasmid DNA was mixed with the PolyExpress transfection reagent in a 1:3 ratio (DNA/reagent) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The mixture was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 18–24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. At this time point, the transfection efficiency was typically 60–80%. For cells transfected with a plasmid encoding an shRNA reagent (TEM4 or scrambled control), the plasmid was transiently transfected into MCF-10A cells with PolyExpress as described above. At 48 h, a plasmid encoding one of the CEP4 mutants or the vector control was transfected, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 48 h in complete medium. As judged by the GFP signal evident throughout the 96-h period, the transfection efficiency was typically 70–80%. Cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and sonicated three times each for 10 s followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble debris. The lysate was assayed for protein concentration using a protein dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Samples of known protein concentration were denatured with 5× SDS sample buffer (50% (v/v) glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.4 m Tris, pH 6.8, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore Corp.). The blot was developed with the appropriate antibodies and detected with chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). For MCF-10A cells expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant CEP4, cells were lysed in hypotonic, detergent-free lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm bisindolylmaleimide, protease inhibitors (1:1000), and phosphatase inhibitors (1:100)) followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG EZview beads. Anti-FLAG beads (60 μl pre-equilibrated in cold TBS) were applied to the lysate and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged at 8200 × g for 5 min and washed three times in hypotonic, detergent-free lysis buffer. Pellets were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a PVDF membrane, and immunoreactive bands were detected with the appropriate antibody. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Q61L-Cdc42 was expressed from a bacterial expression vector (pGEX-2T) in BL21 cells. This plasmid was provided by the laboratory of Prof. Gary Bokoch (Scripps Research Institute; Addgene catalog number 12971). Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and lysed with 3 ml of B-PER reagent (Fisher Scientific) containing 0.2% (6 μl) lysozyme, 0.2% (6 μl) DNase I, and 1% protease inhibitor. The bacterial cell lysate was prepared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant containing Cdc42-Q61L was added to 500 μl of glutathione-Sepharose affinity resin in a Bio-Rad minicolumn pre-equilibrated in wash buffer (50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and the column was washed twice with 10 column volumes. The beads with immobilized Cdc42-Q61L were suspended in wash buffer, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. MCF-10A cells expressing myc-tagged wild-type or mutant CEP4 were lysed in hypotonic, detergent-free buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm bisindolylmaleimide, protease inhibitors (1:1000), and phosphatase inhibitors (1:100)). The cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and precleared with 60 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fisher Scientific) by rotating at 4 °C for 1 h. The precleared MCF-10A cell lysate was incubated with immobilized Q61L-Cdc42 (described above) by rotation at 4 °C for 40 min. Following two washes with hypotonic, detergent-free lysis buffer, the bound protein was eluted by boiling with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Immunochemical analysis with anti-myc was used to determine the amount of myc-tagged CEP4 that was bound to Cdc42. Proteins that were physically associated with CEP4 were isolated by use of a CEP4 double mutant expressed from a TAP vector that conferred two affinity tags at the C terminus of CEP4. The affinity tags enabled binding to a streptavidin-binding resin and a calmodulin-binding resin, respectively (Agilent Technologies). MCF-10A cells grown in three 10-cm plates to 80–90% confluence were transfected with a TAP vector expressing a CEP4 double mutant (S18A/S80A or S18D/S80D). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic, detergent-free lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm bisindolylmaleimide, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture, and 1% phosphatase inhibitor mixture) and disrupted by three successive freeze-thaw cycles (10 min at −150 °C and 10 min in cold water). After centrifugation of the cells at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the crude cell lysate was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of streptavidin-binding resin (pre-equilibrated with streptavidin binding buffer). The resin and any bound proteins were washed twice with 750 μl of streptavidin binding buffer and eluted with 200 μl of streptavidin elution buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The eluate was incubated with 50 μl of calmodulin-binding resin (pre-equilibrated with calmodulin binding buffer) at 4 °C for 3 h and washed twice with 750 μl of calmodulin binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling with 1× loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and stained with GelCode Blue. Bands of interest were excised and analyzed by MS/MS. Cell motility was measured by the cell sedimentation method, which required a 10-well glass slide and a 10-hole metallic manifold (Creative Scientific Methods, Inc.). The cells were applied to the slide through the manifold so that the cells form a tight concentric circle in each well. After incubation overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the manifold was removed, and the cells were immediately viewed under a Nikon Diaphot microscope (t = 0). The extent of movement was determined in triplicate by measuring the difference in total area at t = 0 and t = 6 h using a camera attached to the microscope (Moticam 2000) and Motic Image software. The results of triplicate measurements were averaged. Cells were cultured overnight on polylysine-coated coverslips and then transfected with the myc-tagged CEP4-S18D/S80D or -S18A/S80A constructs. Each coverslip was washed twice in 2 ml of PHEM buffer (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9) and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Nonspecific sites were blocked for 15 min at 37 °C with 2% BSA plus 0.1% sodium azide in TBS-Tween 20. After blocking, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with an anti-myc tag rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) diluted to 1:300. Samples were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted to 1:300 for 1.5 h at 37 °C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed three times with TBS-Tween 20. Following anti-myc staining, F-actin was stained for 1 h at 37 °C with rhodamine-phalloidin diluted to 1:300 (Cytoskeleton, Inc.), and nuclei were stained for 5 min at 37 °C with Hoechst 33342 stain diluted to 1:1000 (Invitrogen) before mounting. Imaging was performed with a Plan-Neofluor 63× oil immersion objective lens on a Zeiss Axio Imager-M2 upright fluorescence microscope. Activation of Rac was measured in lysates of MCF-10A cells prepared in commercially available buffers (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) as described previously (3.De S. Tsimounis A. Chen X. Rotenberg S.A. Phosphorylation of α-tubulin by protein kinase C stimulates microtubule dynamics in human breast cells.Cytoskeleton. 2014; 71: 257-272Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cell lysates containing a total protein content of 600 μg of protein were incubated with p21-activated kinase-binding domain-agarose beads (20 μg) at 4 °C for 1 h. Following centrifugation, the beads were washed once with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, and 40 mm NaCl) followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The entire sample was loaded, and the pelleted material was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PDVF membrane, and probed with anti-Rac. To identify sites of phosphorylation in pure, recombinant GST-tagged CEP4 (synthesized by a wheat germ system), the protein (1.1 μg) was phosphorylated at 30 °C for 2 h by pure human PKCα (1 μg) in vitro (5.Chen X. Zhao X. Abeyweera T.P. Rotenberg S.A. Analysis of substrates of protein kinase C isoforms in human breast cells by the traceable kinase method.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 7087-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated product and untreated control CEP4 were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE (0.75 mm thickness). After staining with GelCode Blue, the gel slices corresponding to phospho-CEP4 or untreated CEP4 were digested with endo-Lys-C and endo-Glu-C. To identify proteins that co-purified with TAP-CEP4, gel-resolved bands of interest were excised and digested in situ with trypsin. For these experiments, the resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer. All MS/MS spectra were searched against the NCBI database with a probability or significance threshold of p < 0.05 using the automated Mascot algorithm. Identification of a protein required that two or more MS/MS spectra matched peptides of the same protein entry in the database. MS analysis was performed at the MS and Proteomics Resource at the Yale School of Medicine. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Each experiment was performed a minimum of three times. The difference between groups was assessed with the Student's t test. In an initial approach to define the site(s) of CEP4 phosphorylation, we evaluated Ser/Thr residues lying within PKC consensus sites. Whereas a canonical consensus site consists of a Ser or Thr flanked by one or two cationic residues (20.Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. Consensus sequences as substrate specificity determinants for protein kinases and protein phosphatases.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a partial site would be that in which only one side of the phosphorylated site is adjacent to a cationic residue(s). Upon inspection of the CEP4 primary sequence, Ser18, Ser77, Ser80, and Ser86 were found to be embedded in either a complete PKC consensus site (Ser18) or partial site (Ser77, Ser80, and Ser86) and were clustered in the N-terminal region (Fig. 1A). Site-directed mutagenesis of each Ser codon to an Asp codon created a negative charge, thereby simulating the presence of a phosphate group at this position in the protein. Each pseudophosphorylated mutant was expressed bearing both FLAG and myc epitope tags. Following transient transfection, whole cell lysates were analyzed for levels of mutant expression by Western blot analysis using anti-myc (Fig. 1B). It was observed that the mutant proteins were stably expressed at equivalent levels. MCF-10A cells are weakly motile and express PKC isoforms at low levels. Because PKC activation promotes motility of these cells (4.Sun X.-G. Rotenberg S.A. Overexpression of PKCα in MCF-10A human breast cells engenders dramatic alterations in morphology, proliferation, and motility.Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether any of the pseudophosphorylated mutants of CEP4 elicited increased motility in the absence of PKC activation. Therefore, each of the four mutants was tested for its ability to engender motility of MCF-10A cells relative to the WT and vector control (VC) (Fig. 1C). Compared with the WT, two mutants, namely S18D and S80D, promoted motility of these cells by 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. To validate that these sites are directly phosphorylated by PKC, in vitro phosphorylation of pure, recombinant CEP4 was performed with PKCα (5.Chen X. Zhao X. Abeyweera T.P. Rotenberg S.A. Analysis of substrates of protein kinase C isoforms in human breast cells by the traceable kinase method.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 7087-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) followed by MS/MS analysis.

While use of such a system introduces substantive continuum background in the spectral dataset, we show that appropriate treatment of the continuum and characteristic emission results in accurate discrimination of pharmaceutical formulations of similar stoichiometry. Specifically, our results suggest that near-perfect classification can be obtained by employing suitable multivariate analysis on the acquired spectra, without prior removal of the continuum background. Indeed, we conjecture that pre-processing in the form of background removal may introduce spurious features in the signal. Our findings in this report significantly advance the prior results in time-integrated LIBS application and suggest the possibility of a portable, non-gated LIBS system as a process analytical tool, given its simple instrumentation needs, real-time capability and lack of sample preparation requirements."

The thiostrepton producer Streptomyces azureus prevents self-intoxication by expressing the thiostrepton-resistance methyltransferase (Tsr), which methylates the 2'-hydroxyl of 23 S rRNA nucleotide adenosine 1067 within the thiostrepton binding site. Tsr is a homodimer with each protomer containing an L30e-like amino-terminal domain (NTD) and a SPOUT methyltransferase family catalytic carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD). We show that both enzyme domains are required for high affinity RNA substrate binding. The Tsr-CTD has intrinsic, weak RNA affinity that is necessary to direct the specific high-affinity Tsr-RNA interaction via NTDs, which have no detectable RNA affinity in isolation. RNA structure probing experiments identify the Tsr footprint on the RNA and structural changes in the substrate, induced specifically upon NTD binding, which are necessary for catalysis by the CTD. Additionally, we identify a key amino acid in each domain responsible for CTD-RNA binding and the observed NTD-dependent RNA structural changes. These studies allow us to develop a model for Tsr-RNA interaction in which the coordinated substrate recognition of each Tsr structural domain is an obligatory pre-catalytic recognition event. Our findings underscore the complexity of substrate recognition by RNA modification enzymes and the potential for direct involvement of the RNA substrate in controlling the process of its modification."

The complex topologies and numerous domains of many secreted proteins in conjunction with their high flux into the ER make folding of these proteins particularly challenging.

The ERAD machinery faces a challenging problem in specificity. Insufficient degradation causes accumulation of misfolded proteins, which is associated with disease, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (1.Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, functional amyloid, and human disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar), whereas excessive degradation causes the loss of potentially functional proteins as in cystic fibrosis (2.Younger J.M. Chen L.

To ensure efficient disposal of misfolded glycoproteins found in the ER lumen, cells employ a two-part commitment signal.

These events are orchestrated by Kar2, an ER-localized Hsp70, Hrd3, a membrane-bound component of the Hrd1 complex, and Yos9.

Cell. 2011; 22: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Given that Yos9 can bind both the signal glycan as well as misfolded protein determinants, we hypothesized that Yos9 may contribute to the integration of both signals required for ERAD. To explore this possibility, we characterized the binding of misfolded proteins by Yos9 in vitro. Using both the full-length protein as well as a proteolytically derived variant of Yos9 that is functional in vivo, we show that Yos9 exhibits sequence-specific recognition of linear peptides from CPY* and that binding either a model unfolded protein or peptide in vitro results in the aggregation of Yos9 with its binding partner. This substrate-induced aggregation constitutes a novel property of Yos9 that has the potential to be biologically important for its function in ERAD. Limited proteolysis was carried out by treating 100 μg of purified Yos9 with 0.005 units of elastase (5 μl of 1 unit/ml, where 1 unit is defined as 9.6 units/mg) in a 250-μl reaction (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4) for 2.5 h at 23 °C and mixing continuously at 500 rpm. The reaction was quenched by the addition of guanidine chloride crystals until saturation and run on a gel, which was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Bands were cut out, and mass spectrometry was performed by the David King laboratory (University of California at Berkeley). The mass of the predominant cleavage product was confirmed to be 45,401–45,403 Da. For comparison, Yos9(22–421) is calculated to be 45,407 Da. His-tagged Yos9 or Yos9(22–421) was purified as described previously (3.Quan E.M. Kamiya Y. Kamiya D. Denic V. Weibezahn J. Kato K. Weissman J.S.

Measurements were conducted on a Jasco J-715 spectrometer in a 2-mm cuvette at 20 °C. Samples contained 0.05 mg/ml Yos9(22–421) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The spectrum was recorded over the range of 195–250 nm at a scanning speed of 5 nm/min and a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. Molecular weight determination for purified Yos9 and Yos9(22–421) was done by SEC (Shodex KW-803 column) with an Ettan LC (GE Healthcare) and in-line DAWN HELEOS MALS and OPTILab rEX differential refractive index detectors (Wyatt Technology Corp.). Data were analyzed by the ASTRA V software package. SEC was performed in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. CPY* degradation was measured in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C strain with a genomic copy of either Yos9 (wild type) or Yos9(22–421). The Yos9(22–421) strain (yJW1759) was constructed via a URA3 intermediate and retains both the endogenous promoter and terminator.

Hexokinase was used as a loading control and was detected by an anti-hexokinase antibody (US Biologicals) at 1:1200. The peptide array (W1007 B) was made by the MIT Biopolymers Laboratory for the Peter Walter laboratory. The CPY* tiling arrays was composed of 18-mer peptides that tiled through the CPY* sequence 3 amino acids at a time.

Synthetic peptides (Elim Biosciences) were purified to >90% purity, and the identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Peptides were labeled with the fluorophore fluorescein amidite (FAM). The following peptides were used in this study: ΔEspP-FAM (MKK HKR ILA LCF LGL LQS SYS FA K(5-FAM)-NH2); ΔEspP (MKK HKR ILA LCF LGL LQS SYS AAK KKK). For binding of Yos9 to ΔEspP-FAM, changes in fluorescence anisotropy were measured on a Spectramax-M5 plate reader using a protocol described previously (24.Gardner B.M. Walter P. Unfolded proteins are Ire1-activating ligands that directly induce the unfolded protein response.Science. 2011; 333: 1891-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of Yos9 were added to 50 nm FAM-labeled peptides in 20-μl reactions, and after a 30-min incubation, readings were made with λex = 485 nm and λem = 525 nm. Anisotropy values are reported as an average of three separate titrations. For binding of Yos9 to Δ131Δ labeled with the fluorophore 5-((((2-iodoacetyl) amino)ethyl) amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS), changes in fluorescence anisotropy were measured on a Jobin Yvon fluorometer with excitation and emission monochromator slits both set to 7 nm, an integration time of 1 s, and with λex = 340 nm and λem = 480 nm. Increasing concentrations of Yos9 were added to 1.25 μm Δ131Δ. Values are reported as an average of four readings. IAEDANS-labeled Δ131Δ was donated by the Agard laboratory and made as described previously (26.Street T.O. Lavery L.A. Agard D.A. Substrate binding drives large-scale conformational changes in the Hsp90 molecular chaperone.Mol. Cell. 2011; 42: 96-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For both ΔEspP-FAM and IAEDANS-labeled Δ131Δ data sets, anisotropy (r) values were calculated from Equation 1, r=lpara−lparalpara+(2⋅lpara)(Eq. 1) where Ipara and Iperp are the measured intensities when the excitation and emission polarizers are parallel or perpendicular, respectively. Binding constants were calculated by fitting the data to Equation 2, rtotal=rfree+(rbound−rfree)[Yos9]n[Yos9]n+Kd(Eq. 2) where [Yos9] is the concentration of Yos9; n is the Hill coefficient (assumed to be 1 for the case of Yos9 at low concentrations), and Kd is the dissociation constant. The variables rfree and rbound were fixed to the anisotropy of the peptide alone and the maximum anisotropy observed in the presence of Yos9, respectively. The expression and purification of Δ131Δ from Escherichia coli were performed as described previously (27.Alexandrescu A.T. Abeygunawardana C. Shortle D. Structure and dynamics of a denatured 131-residue fragment of staphylococcal nuclease: a heteronuclear NMR study.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) with the following modifications for isotopic labeling. Δ131Δ was expressed beginning with a 20-ml overnight starter culture in LB that was spun down and resuspended in 1 liter of M9 minimal growth media supplemented with 1 g/liter [15N]ammonium chloride and 0.5 g/liter ISOGRO growth supplement (Sigma). HSQC data of Δ131Δ in buffer (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6) were acquired on the University of California at Berkeley 900-MHz spectrometer with a cryoprobe using a fast HSQC pulse sequence from Mark Kelly (University of California at San Francisco). An initial HSQC of 143 μm Δ131Δ was acquired followed by HSQC after serial additions of Yos9(22–421). Data were processed with NMRPipe (28.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar), and peak height analysis was performed with the ccpn analysis software. Δ131Δ assignments were transferred from a previously published study (29.Alexandrescu A.T. Shortle D. Backbone dynamics of a highly disordered 131 residue fragment of staphylococcal nuclease.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 527-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). DLS measurements were done on a DynaPro MS/X light scattering instrument (Wyatt Technology). The laser is a 55-milliwatt laser and 826.6 nm; detection angle is 90°. Samples were prepared in 10 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, and solutions were filtered immediately prior to mixing. The laser power was 100%. Data were analyzed with Dynamics Version 6 software. Histograms represent the average of three independent data sets (except for Yos9(22–421) plus bovine serum albumin (BSA) for which there was only a single measurement at the specified concentration) each with at least 10 measurements. Protein solutions were centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g after which the supernatant was separated from the pellet. SDS-loading buffer was added to samples, and they were run on a 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in MES buffer followed by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. To assist in the biophysical characterization of Yos9, we sought to define a compact, stable domain that retained functionality in vivo. To this end, we carried out limited proteolysis of purified, recombinant Yos9. Using elastase, we identified a well defined 45-kDa fragment that by mass spectrometry corresponded to residues 22–421 (Fig. 1, A and B) and was similar to a truncation variant previously shown to be structured by circular dichroism (30.Hanna J. Schütz A. Zimmermann F. Behlke J. Sommer T. Heinemann U. Structural and biochemical basis of Yos9 protein dimerization and possible contribution to self-association of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase degradation ubiquitin-ligase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 8633-8640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This fragment, Yos9(22–421), does not include the signal sequence or C-terminal residues that are part of a region predicted to be disordered by FoldIndex (31.Prilusky J. Felder C.E. Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Rydberg E.H. Man O. Beckmann J.S. Silman I. Sussman J.L. FoldIndex: a simple tool to predict whether a given protein sequence is intrinsically unfolded.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Importantly, when integrated into the genome in place of the full-length protein, Yos9(22–421) facilitates CPY* degradation in a manner indistinguishable from full-length Yos9 (Fig. 1C). Thus, Yos9(22–421) represents a compact, folded domain that is sufficient to support Yos9-mediated degradation of a glycoprotein in vivo. In vitro, Yos9(22–421) also behaved similarly to the full-length protein. Following renaturation, recombinant Yos9(22–421) appeared folded by circular dichroism in agreement with previous studies (3.Quan E.M. Kamiya Y. Kamiya D. Denic V. Weibezahn J. Kato K. Weissman J.S.

Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 8633-8640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) indicating secondary structure similar to that of the full-length protein (Fig. 1D). In addition, Yos9(22–421) binds fluorescently labeled mannotriose with an affinity similar to that observed for Yos9 (supplemental Fig. S1). Currently, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the oligomeric state of Yos9 (3.Quan E.M. Kamiya Y. Kamiya D. Denic V. Weibezahn J. Kato K. Weissman J.S. Defining the glycan destruction signal for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 870-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 30.Hanna J.

Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 8633-8640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Previous work hypothesized that Yos9 exists as a trimer (3.Quan E.M. Kamiya Y. Kamiya D. Denic V.

Cell. 2008; 32: 870-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), but this was based on its volume of elution from a size exclusion column, which may have overestimated the molecular weight due to the presence of disordered regions. In another study, the crystal structure of a portion of Yos9 (Yos9(226–424)) showed that it could form a dimer (30.Hanna J. Schütz A. Zimmermann F. Behlke J. Sommer T. Heinemann U. Structural and biochemical basis of Yos9 protein dimerization and possible contribution to self-association of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase degradation ubiquitin-ligase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 8633-8640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The authors (30.Hanna J. Schütz A. Zimmermann F. Behlke J. Sommer T. Heinemann U. Structural and biochemical basis of Yos9 protein dimerization and possible contribution to self-association of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase degradation ubiquitin-ligase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 8633-8640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) confirmed this interaction via solution measurements in vitro, but they could not detect the dimer or find evidence of its function in vivo. We determined the molecular weight of both full-length and Yos9(22–421) in solution using size exclusion chromatography multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), and we found that these weights were consistent with both species existing as monomers (Fig. 1E). Although the molecular weights were constant over a range of concentrations (8–116 μm), it is possible that a low affinity dimer could dissociate within the SEC column producing the observed results. To determine whether Yos9 specifically recognizes p"
