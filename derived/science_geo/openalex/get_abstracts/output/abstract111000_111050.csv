https://openalex.org/W1623804763,"We have identified the palmitoylated cysteine residues of alpha q and alpha s, alpha subunits of two heterotrimeric G proteins. Mutational substitutions of serines for cysteines 9 and 10 in alpha q and cysteine 3 in alpha s profoundly alter behavior of the subunits expressed in HEK293 cells. Neither mutant alpha subunit incorporates palmitate; both mutant proteins are found in the soluble rather than the particulate fraction; mutant alpha q or alpha s cannot couple a co-expressed receptor to stimulation of phospholipase C or adenylylcyclase, respectively; cysteine substitution prevents a mutationally activated alpha q (R183C) from stimulating phospholipase C directly, and reduces but does not abolish the ability of a similarly activated alpha s (R201C) to stimulate cAMP synthesis. Substitution of a myristoylation sequence for the palmitoylation sites leads to labeling of alpha q and alpha s by myristate, rather than by palmitate. Myristoylation restores the abilities of both nonpalmitoylated alpha q and alpha s to attach to membranes and, in the case of alpha q, restores its ability to stimulate phospholipase C, whether triggered by the R183C mutation or by receptor activation. These findings identify palmitoylation as a critical determinant of membrane attachment for alpha q and alpha s and show that this modification is required for normal signaling by these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1569326224,"Furin is a membrane-associated calcium-dependent serine endoprotease that cleaves proproteins on the carboxyl side of the consensus sequence -Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg-. Using site-directed mutagenesis, a variant alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) was constructed which contains in its reactive site -Arg-X-X-Arg-, the minimal sequence required for efficient processing by furin (Molloy, S. S., Bresnahan, P. A., Leppla, S. H., Klimpel, K. R., and Thomas, G. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16396-16402). This alpha 1-AT variant, [Arg355 Arg358]alpha 1-AT (alpha 1-PDX), is greater than 3,000-fold more effective than [Arg358]alpha 1-AT (alpha 1-AT Pittsburgh, alpha 1-PIT) at inhibiting furin in vitro (K0.5 = 0.03 microgram/ml). Furthermore, the P4 Arg in alpha 1-PDX greatly attenuates the thrombin inhibitory properties of this serpin (> 300-fold) compared with alpha 1-PIT (which contains a P4 Ala), thus increasing the selectivity of alpha 1-PDX for furin. Expression studies show that alpha 1-PDX, and not alpha 1-PIT, blocks the processing of two furin substrates, pro-beta-nerve growth factor and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 gp160 in transfected cells. In addition, a syncytium assay shows that alpha 1-PDX blocks the membrane fusogenic properties of HIV-1 gp160. The potential use of alpha 1-PDX in manipulating the activation of proproteins in a tissue- and time-specific manner is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1594606204,"Folate-protein conjugates can be nondestructively delivered into a cell's cytoplasm via folate receptor-mediated endocytosis if (i) the target cells express a folate-binding protein, and (ii) if the folate is linked to its attached protein at a site that does not interfere with receptor recognition. Because such conjugates have been observed to remain in endosomal compartments for extended periods following cellular uptake, we decided to evaluate whether release into the cytoplasm might be expedited by inclusion of a translocation domain in the folate-protein construct. To test this possibility, momordin-folate and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin-folate conjugates (LysPE38 and Cys-PE35), i.e. protein synthesis inhibitors either lacking or containing the desired translocation domain, respectively, were examined for their abilities to block protein synthesis in a variety of cell types. The translocation competent LysPE38-folate construct was found to kill cells six times more rapidly with 10-fold greater potency than the permeation-incompetent mormordin-folate. Further, cells expressing low levels of folate receptors could only be exterminated by the translocation competent Pseudomonas exotoxin-folate conjugates. When the translocation capability of CysPE35-folate was inactivated by modification of Cys287, the construct also lost most of its cytotoxicity. These data suggest that autocatalysis of transport from an internal vesicular compartment into the cytoplasm can greatly augment the cytotoxicity of a protein toxin entering cells via the folate endocytosis pathway. Because the folate ligand can selectively target a protein conjugate to cancer cells in the presence of normal cells, such translocatable toxin-folate constructs warrant further study as a possible treatment for some malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1676164379,"Abstract Increased hepatic glucose production (HGP) is the major cause of fasting hyperglycemia in all forms of diabetes. Glucokinase (GK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) are the proximal and the distal enzymatic steps, respectively, in the regulation of HGP. We examined the impact of changes in GK and Glc-6-Pase activities on in vivo hepatic glucose fluxes in diabetic (D) and control (C) rats. In particular, the acute regulation by insulin was investigated using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique in conscious rats. In experimental diabetes (6 weeks): (a) GK mRNA was decreased by approximately 40%; (b) the Vmax of GK was markedly decreased (approximately 4 versus 9 mumol/g wet weight/min) and that of Glc-6-Pase was 2-fold increased (approximately 30 versus 15 mumol/g wet weight/min, D versus C), while (c) the Km of GK (approximately 10 mM) and Glc-6-Pase (approximately 1.5 mM) were unchanged. HGP was increased by 65% in diabetes and correlated highly with the ratio of Glc-6-Pase/GK (r = 0.81, p < 0.01). Following acute hyperinsulinemia (2 h): (a) GK mRNA increased by approximately 2-fold in both C and D; (b) GK Vmax did not change in C, but doubled to near-normal in D; (c) Glc-6-Pase Vmax decreased by 23% in C and by 34% in D; (d) the Km of GK decreased by approximately 40% (p < 0.01) in C. Acute hyperinsulinemia almost completely inhibited HGP in both C and D, and no correlation was demonstrated between HGP and the ratio of Glc-6-Pase/GK in these groups. Our data suggest that GK and Glc-6-Pase are important determinants of fasting HGP in diabetes. However, acute changes in Glc-6-Pase and GK activities can account for only a small portion of the in vivo inhibition of hepatic glucose flux by insulin, suggesting additional mechanisms for the short-term regulation of HGP."
https://openalex.org/W1494012470,"In this paper we demonstrate the synthesis of the components of the classical complement pathway, namely C1q, C1r, C1s, C1-Inh, C2, C4, and C5, by human glioma cell lines (U118MG, T193, and T98G). All these components were structurally, antigenically, and functionally similar to their serum counterparts as determined by biosynthetic labeling experiments, Western blot analysis, and hemolytic assays. Northern blot analysis of mRNA demonstrated that, for each of these components, their specific mRNA had the same size as the equivalent mRNA from hepatic tissue. We could not detect the synthesis of C4bp by these cell lines, and the secretion of C1q was only detected after stimulation by interferon-gamma. All these syntheses were up-regulated by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor. Interleukin-1 beta only increased C2 expression and reproducibly down-regulated C5 secretion when used at high doses. Glioma cell lines appear to be an efficient and convenient model for the analysis of complement expression in human astrocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1543197907,"NGFI-B is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily encoded by an immediate-early gene. It is rapidly synthesized and phosphorylated in PC12 cells in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) and other agents and is differentially phosphorylated dependent upon the inducing stimulus. The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of NGFI-B has been expressed in bacteria and purified. The purified protein is phosphorylated by protein kinase or by extracts from NGF-treated PC12 cells. The phosphorylated residues within the DBD have been identified as Ser-340 and Ser-350. The use of mutants in which either or both of these residues were replaced with alanines revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-350, located within the A box, a motif necessary for DNA binding by NGFI-B, resulted in a decrease in binding to the NGFI-B response element, while phosphorylation of Ser-340 had little or no effect. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylation of a nuclear receptor DBD results in a change in DNA binding and provides another potential mechanism for regulating NGFI-B activity."
https://openalex.org/W1550929510,"The factors that drive mineralization of matrix vesicles (MV) have proven difficult to elucidate; in the present studies, various detergent, chemical, and enzyme treatments were used to reveal the nature of the nucleational core. Incubation with detergents that permeabilized the membrane enhanced calcification of treated MV incubated in synthetic cartilage lymph. While detergents removed most of the membrane lipid, they left significant amounts of the MV annexins and nearly all of the Ca2+, Pi, and Zn2+. Extraction with 1 M NaCl removed much of the Ca2+ and Pi present in MV, markedly reducing Ca2+ accumulation; these effects could be prevented by low levels of Ca2+ and Pi in the NaCl extractant. Treatment with chymotrypsin appeared to damage proteins required for MV mineralization; further treatment with detergents to bypass the membrane reactivated MV mineralization. Treatment of MV with pH 6 citrate removed Ca2+ and Pi, destroying their ability to mineralize; subsequent treatment with detergents did not reactivate these MV. Incubation of the detergent-resistant core with o-phenanthroline complexed Zn2+ and stimulated mineralization; addition of Zn2+ to synthetic cartilage lymph blocked the ability of the core to mineralize. These studies show that once the nucleational core complex is formed, the membrane-enclosed domain is no longer essential for MV calcification. Our findings indicate that the MV core contains two main components as follows: a smaller membrane-associated complex of Ca2+, Pi, phosphatidylserine, and the annexins that nucleates crystalline mineral formation, and a larger pool of Ca2+ and Pi bound to lumenal proteins. These proteins appear to bind large amounts of mineral ions, stabilize the nucleational complex, and aid its transformation to the first crystalline phase. Once nucleated, the crystalline phase appears to feed on protein-bound mineral ions until external ions enter through the MV ion channels. Zn2+ appears to regulate gating of the ion channels and conversion of the nucleational complex to the crystalline state."
https://openalex.org/W1516726110,"A cDNA (ST1C1 cDNA) encoding a N-hydroxyarylamine sulfotransferase (HAST-I) was isolated from a liver cDNA library of a male adult rat and was expressed in COS-1 cells. ST1C1 cDNA (1363 base pairs) encoded a protein of 304 amino acids with a molecular mass of 35,768 daltons, which shared 50.7 and 46.1% sequence identity with rat aryl (ST1A1 (PST-1)) and estrogen (rOST) sulfotransferases, respectively. N-terminal amino acid sequences of three digested polypeptide fragments of HAST-I were completely identical with two portions of the ST1C1 amino acid sequence. The profile of age- and sex-related expression of ST1C1 mRNA was quite consistent with changes in the sulfating activity of N-hydroxyarylamine and HAST contents in rat livers. ST1C1 expressed in COS-1 cells catalyzed a sulfation of N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (N-OH-AAF) at a rate of 4.98 nmol/mg of protein/min and mediated PAPS (3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate)-dependent DNA binding of N-OH-AAF. Although ASTIV was believed to be responsible for the activation of N-OH-AAF, ST1A1 encoding an arylsulfotransferase ASTIV, showed only a marginal activity in a sulfation and covalent binding of N-OH-AAF. These data clearly indicate that ST1C1 cDNA codes a new form of a male-dominant sulfotransferase (HAST) responsible for the bioactivation of N-hydroxyarylamines in rat livers."
https://openalex.org/W1502935855,"Acidic phospholipids in a fluid phase dissociate ADP or ATP tightly bound to DnaA protein and, in the presence of ATP and DNA, can restore an inactive ADP form to full activity (Sekimizu, K., and Kornberg, A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7131-7135). Further studies of the interactions between DnaA protein and lipids have used two functional assays: 1) release of ADP or ATP from DnaA and 2) DNA replication upon rejuvenation of an inactive ADP-DnaA protein complex. Among a variety of phospholipids tested were pure synthetic compounds and the mixtures from Escherichia coli auxotrophs (fabA), which are unable to synthesize unsaturated fatty acids and can be supplemented with different acyl derivatives. Fatty acid composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography and membrane fluidity by fluorescence spectroscopy using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene as a probe. Lipid requirements of DnaA protein were shown to be: 1) phospholipids in a fluid phase (i.e. above the transition temperature), 2) a charged polar head group, 3) a lamellar phase (i.e. hexagonal II structures were inactive), and 4) a certain degree of fluidity imparted by the fatty acids esterified to the glycerol backbone. This conclusion was based on the incorporation of: 1) cholesterol, known to increase the packing of lipids, or 2) a branched fatty acyl derivative, which exhibits a fluidizing effect similar to that of a cis double bond. Both agents demonstrated that membrane fluidity is required for DnaA protein function in vitro, consistent with early studies of chromosome initiation in growing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1591084420,"Squalene synthase catalyzes the reductive dimerization of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate to form squalene at the final branchpoint of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. We report herein that isoprenyl 1,1-bisphosphonates and related analogs are potent inhibitors of rat microsomal squalene synthase (I50 = 0.7-32 nM). In addition, members of this family are potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis in rats on intravenous and oral dosing, as well as cholesterol lowering agents in rats and hamsters. Significant inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in rats by lovastatin occurs with a concomitant inhibition of dolichol and coenzyme-Q9 synthesis. In contrast, bisphosphonate 4 has no effect on dolichol and coenzyme-Q9 biosynthesis in rats under conditions where cholesterol biosynthesis is > 90% inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W1554617882,"We have investigated the mechanism by which inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in rat hepatocytes by choline deprivation causes a reduction in the secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) (Yao, Z., and Vance, D. E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2998-3004). Rats ingested a choline-deficient or control diet for 3 days, and subcellular fractions of liver were prepared. No change in the amount of apolipoprotein B in the lumina of the endoplasmic reticulum was observed, but there was a 40-50% decrease of apolipoprotein B in the lumina of the Golgi from choline-deficient compared with control rats. Incubation of microsomes, derived from choline-deficient and -supplemented hepatocytes, with trypsin showed similar degradation of apolipoprotein B, indicating similar quantities of this protein are present on the surface and within the lumina. The VLDL particles in the Golgi of liver cells and in plasma, on average, were larger in samples derived from choline-deficient compared with choline-supplemented animals. Incubation of plasma VLDL with proteases demonstrated that the apolipoprotein B of plasma VLDL particles from choline-deficient animals had a different susceptibility to digestion than did VLDL from choline-supplemented animals. These data indicate that the number of VLDL particles assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver is similar in choline-deficient and -supplemented rats, but the number of particles is decreased in the Golgi from choline-deficient animals."
https://openalex.org/W1550868339,"A novel transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase-sigma (RPTP-sigma) was cloned from a rat brain stem cDNA library. The extracellular segment of one form of RPTP-sigma contains 824 amino acids and is composed of three immunoglobulin-like and five fibronectin type III (FNIII)-like repeats. The 627-amino acid cytoplasmic region of RPTP-sigma consists of two catalytic domains oriented in tandem. Northern blot analyses indicate that RPTP-sigma is highly expressed in the brain as two major transcripts of 5.7 and 6.9 kilobases (kb). The 5.7-kb transcript is expressed exclusively in the brain while the 6.9-kb species can be detected in the lung and heart, but at significantly lower levels. In situ hybridization studies confirm that RPTP-sigma is localized predominantly in the nervous system and can be detected in the rat as early as embryonic day 12. During embryonic development, RPTP-sigma is expressed extensively in the central and peripheral nervous systems, including the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia as well as the retina. In adult rat brain, expression is restricted primarily to the olfactory tubercule, cerebellum, and hippocampus. Within the latter structure, RPTP-sigma is present in the pyramidal cell layer and granular layer of the dentate gyrus. Transfection of RPTP-sigma cDNA into human embryonic kidney 293 cells results in the synthesis of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 200 kDa as detected by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses using polyclonal antibodies against the FNIII-like repeats present in the extracellular domain of RPTP-sigma. The gene for RPTP-sigma has been mapped to distal chromosome 17 in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1562634795,"An expression library from porcine kidney cortex was screened with a monoclonal antibody (R4A6) which stimulates high-affinity phlorizin binding in kidney and intestine but does not react with the membrane protein (SGLT1) which mediates Na(+)-coupled transport of D-glucose (Hediger, M.A., Coady, M.J., Ikeda, T.S., and Wright, E.M. (1987) Nature 330, 379-381). A cDNA (RS1) was obtained which codes for a hydrophilic M(r) 66,832 polypeptide and contains a predicted hydrophobic alpha-helix at the COOH terminus. After expression in Xenopus oocytes RS1 protein was found associated with the plasma membrane. RS1-homologous mRNAs were detected in renal outer cortex and outer medulla, small intestine, liver, and LLCPK1 cells, but not in skeletal muscle, heart muscle, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, renal inner medulla, and Xenopus oocytes. After nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of renal brush-border membranes comigration of RS1- and SGLT1-homologous proteins as a high molecular weight complex was demonstrated. RS1 altered the expression of Na(+)-glucose cotransport by SGLT1 in Xenopus oocytes. There was no effect on the expression of the nonhomologous transporters for Na(+)-gamma-aminobutyric acid cotransport and for Na(+)-independent glucose transport. However, RS1 also changed the expression of the SGLT1-homologous Na(+)-myo-inositol cotransporter from MDCK cells. The Vmax of methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (AMG) transport expressed after injection of a small amount of SGLT1-cRNA was increased 40-fold when a stoichiometric amount of RS1-cRNA was coinjected. In addition the voltage and glucose dependence of expressed AMG uptake and the concentration dependence of transport inhibition by phlorizin were changed when stoichiometric amounts of RS1-cRNA were coinjected with SGLT1-cRNA. Thus with SGLT1 one apparent transport site (K0.5 about 100 microM) and one apparent phlorizin inhibition site (Ki about 5 microM) was observed whereas with SGLT1 plus RS1 two apparent transport sites (K0.5(1) about 20 microM, K0.5(2) about 1 mM) and two apparent phlorizin inhibition sites (Ki(1) about 0.3 microM, Ki(2) about 30 microM) were found as has been described in brush-border membrane vesicles of kidney and intestine (see e.g. Koepsell, H., Fritzsch, G., Korn, K., and Madrala, A. (1990) J. Membr. Biol. 114, 113-132). The data suggest that the Na(+)-D-glucose cotransporter and possibly also other SGLT1-type Na(+)-cotransporters contain RS1-type regulatory subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1591638778,"As an approach to elucidate the role of collagen XIV, which is still unclear, molecules exhibiting affinity for this collagen have been sought in connective tissue. Extracts from fetal bovine tendon were resolved by gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was overlaid with native collagen XIV and the collagen XIV-binding molecules revealed by immunodecoration with a monoclonal antitype XIV collagen antibody. This experimental approach allowed us to reveal in tendon extracts a diffuse band, with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa, that binds collagen XIV. This molecule was also found associated with the fractions containing partially purified type XIV collagen. This 100-kDa molecule was sensitive to chondroitinase ABC and, after chondroitinase digestion, yielded a core protein of about 48 kDa. N-terminal sequence analysis of the proteoglycan after blotting allowed us to identify it as decorin. By solid phase assays we have studied this newly described association between decorin and type XIV collagen and shown that it is a saturable process. In addition, preliminary determination of the domains of the two molecules involved in the association has been performed. The possible role of these interactions is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1576606847,"A prerequisite for the selective degradation of intracellular proteins by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway is the attachment of a chain of ubiquitin monomers to the targeted protein. In these multiubiquitin chains, the carboxyl-terminal glycine 76 of ubiquitin is linked via an isopeptide bond to the epsilon-amino group of lysine 48 in the adjacent ubiquitin. It remains to be determined whether these chains are preassembled and attached en masse to the target, are made by sequential conjugation of ubiquitin monomers to ubiquitins already linked to the protein, or both. Using the 20-kDa ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme TaUBC7 from wheat, we have generated free, glycine 76-->lysine 48-linked multiubiquitin chains (Ubqn), and have individually purified Ubqn species (n lysine 48 linkage. We also show in vitro that purified Ubq2 and Ubq4 are competent in activation by ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), in transfer to E2s, and in ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3)-independent conjugation to other Ubqn species and to histones H2A/B. These data demonstrate that multiubiquitin chains exist as free, functional structures in vivo and support the possibility that at least a portion of free ubiquitin is preassembled into multiubiquitin chains prior to its attachment to proteolytic substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1551469893,"The largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) contains a remarkable region of tandem heptapeptide repeats of the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser at its carboxyl terminus. This COOH-terminal domain (CTD) is unphosphorylated in RNAP IIA, extensively phosphorylated in RNAP IIO, and absent in RNAP IIB. The reversible phosphorylation of the CTD has been proposed to be integral to each cycle of transcription from the adenovirus-2 major late promoter. The adenovirus-2 major late promoter, however, may not be a good paradigm for the study of CTD function because in vitro transcription from this promoter is not dependent on the CTD. Previous studies suggest that transcription from the murine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) promoter requires the CTD. In an effort to investigate the role of the CTD and its phosphorylation, a RNAP II-dependent reconstituted transcription system specific for the DHFR promoter was established. In this reconstituted system, RNAP IIA, but not RNAP IIB, can transcribe from the DHFR promoter. Furthermore, RNAP IIB does not compete with RNAP IIA for preinitiation complex assembly. These results suggest that the CTD plays a critical role in the recruitment of RNAP II to the DHFR promoter. The analysis of preinitiation complexes assembled on the DHFR promoter indicates that RNAP IIA readily assembles into functional preinitiation complexes in contrast to the inefficient assembly of RNAP IIO. However, transcript elongation is catalyzed by RNAP IIO as demonstrated by the photoactivated cross-linking of nascent DHFR transcripts to subunit IIo. These results indicate that transcription from the DHFR promoter involves the reversible phosphorylation of the CTD and support the idea that RNAPs IIA and IIO have essential but distinct functions."
https://openalex.org/W1533596768,"The biosynthesis of the prohormone convertase PC2 was studied in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with PC2 cDNA (CHO/PC2) and in rat insulinoma cells (Rin5f). The major form of PC2 synthesized by CHO/PC2 cells was a 75-kDa protein corresponding to proPC2; this protein was retained intracellularly for 2-4 h following synthesis, suggesting prolonged intracellular residence. In contrast, the major form of PC2 within Rin cells initially exhibited a molecular mass of 72 kDa and was then progressively converted to a 64-kDa species. This 64-kDa species, which required 1-2 h to be released, was the major PC2 form detectable in Rin cell medium. Calcium-dependent benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin cleaving activity was found in spent Rin cell medium; this activity could be immunoprecipitated with a carboxyl-terminal PC2 antibody, but not with preimmune serum. In neither cell line did intracellular PC2 become endoglycosidase H-resistant over time. PC2 released from Rin cells was also endoglycosidase H-sensitive. Microsequencing and endoglycosidase H results indicate that 75-kDa CHO cell PC2 and 72-kDa Rin cell PC2 both represent proPC2. We speculate that (a) PC2 undergoes unusual glycosylation, which may be related to its slow release from cells, and (b) the 64-kDa molecule detectable in spent Rin cell medium represents the enzymatically active form of PC2."
https://openalex.org/W1517171683,"The activity of a promoter is influenced by chromosomal and cell cycle/replication context. We analyzed the influences of integration and replication on transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). We found that one requirement for Tat trans-activated expression differed for integrated versus unintegrated HIV-1 LTR. Specifically, the second coding exon of Tat, previously regarded as functionally dispensable, plays a role in the optimal activation of integrated LTRs. We also found that the transcription profile produced from the HIV-1 LTR is influenced by replication. Autonomously replicating vectors that contain the HIV-1 LTR produced patterns of transcription different from counterpart vectors that do not replicate. Both replicating and nonreplicating HIV-1 LTRs remained responsive to Tat."
https://openalex.org/W1548770541,"The 5-methylthio-D-ribose moiety of 5'-(methylthio)-adenosine is converted to methionine in a wide variety of organisms. 2,3-Diketo-5-methylthio-1-phosphopentane is an advanced intermediate in the methionine recycling pathway present in the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae. This unusual metabolite is oxidatively cleaved to yield formate (from C-1), 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate (the transamination product of methionine), and 3-methylthiopropionate. To further characterize this oxidative conversion, the desthio analog of the naturally occurring diketone, namely 2,3-diketo-1-phosphohexane I, was synthesized. If the metabolism of I is analogous to that of 2,3-diketo-5-methylthio-1-phosphopentane it should be converted to formate, 2-ketopentanoate, and butyrate. An enzyme (E-1), which mediates the oxidative conversion of I to formate and 2-ketopentanoate, was isolated from extracts of K. pneumoniae. E-1 was purified 100-fold to homogeneity in 10% yield. The native enzyme is a monomeric protein of M(r) 27,000. The activity of E-1 requires magnesium ion as a cofactor. No other prosthetic groups were detected. Incubation of the enzyme with I, under anaerobic conditions, led to the discovery of two intermediates. These species have been identified by 1H and 13C NMR, UV-visible spectroscopy, and model chemistry studies as 2-hydroxy-3-keto-1-phospho-1-hexene II, generated by enolization of I; and 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-1-hexene III, generated by enzymatic dephosphorylation of II. Intermediates II and III are released from the active site of the enzyme; III accumulates under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, III is non-enzymically oxidized to 2-ketopentanoate, formate, and other products. Compound II was also generated by heating I at pH 7.5 for 7 min. Action of alkaline phosphatase on II produces III."
https://openalex.org/W1536436988,"Dictyostelium discoideum cells express EDTA-sensitive cell-cell adhesion sites soon after the initiation of development and EDTA-resistant adhesion sites later at the aggregation stage. A glycoprotein of M(r) 24,000 (gp24) has been implicated in the mediation of the EDTA-sensitive type of intercellular cohesiveness (Knecht, D. A., Fuller, D. L., and Loomis, W. F. (1987) Dev. Biol. 121, 277-283). In this study, a relatively simple procedure was developed to purify gp24 to homogeneity. A highly specific rabbit antiserum was raised against gp24, and the localization of gp24 at the cell surface was shown by quantitative binding of the anti-gp24 antibodies to intact cells. To demonstrate the cell binding activity of gp24, the binding of solubilized gp24 to intact cells was examined. 125I-Labeled gp24 bound to cells in a dose-dependent and saturable manner, and the binding was displaced specifically by unlabeled gp24. Purified gp24 was capable of inhibiting the reassociation of dispersed cells previously undergoing EDTA-sensitive aggregation. Moreover, precoating cells with anti-gp24 IgG and Fab fragments blocked the binding of 125I-labeled gp24 to cells. Collectively, these in vitro assays provide direct evidence that gp24 is a cell adhesion molecule that most likely functions through a homophilic mode of interaction. The binding of gp24 to cells was sensitive to EGTA, suggesting that the activity of gp24 may involve calcium ions. Binding studies showed that 45Ca2+ could bind to gp24 blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. In addition, preincubation of the native protein with calcium ions resulted in a shift in its gel mobility. It is therefore likely that gp24 mediates cell-cell interactions via a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism, rendering gp24 the first cell adhesion molecule in D. discoideum to utilize a Ca(2+)-based adhesion system."
https://openalex.org/W1495026747,"Angiotensin II stimulates the hepatic synthesis and secretion of angiotensinogen, the substrate of renin. In the present study performed on freshly isolated rat hepatocytes we demonstrate that this effect of angiotensin II is mainly related to a transient inhibition of adenylylcyclase. Agents known to decrease intracellular cAMP (angiotensin II, vasopressin, guanfacine) or the cAMP-antagonist Rp-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic phosphothioate stimulated, whereas cAMP-stimulating agents (isoproterenol, forskolin, glucagon) or the cAMP-agonist Sp-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic phosphothioate inhibited angiotensinogen synthesis. In contrast, all agents known to affect intracellular concentrations of calcium, as confirmed in Fura-2-loaded hepatocytes (Bay K 8644, calcimycin, calmidazolium, ionomycin, or methoxamine) failed to influence the synthesis of angiotensinogen. The inhibitory effect of angiotensin II as well as the stimulatory effect of glucagon on cAMP were inversely related to angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensinogen secretion over a wide concentration range of both peptides. Both the angiotensin II-dependent inhibition of cAMP and the angiotensin II-induced increase in angiotensinogen mRNA were abolished by a pertussis toxin pretreatment. In hepatocyte membranes, pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylated a single protein (approximately 41 kDa) probably representing the alpha-subunit of the Gi-protein, coupling inhibitory receptors to adenylylcyclase. We further show that the increase of angiotensinogen mRNA and secretion mainly represents the result of mRNA stabilization, since in a nuclear run-on assay, angiotensin II pretreatment of hepatocytes does not significantly alter the rate of [32P]UTP incorporation into angiotensinogen mRNA, whereas angiotensin II prolonged the half-life of angiotensinogen mRNA in transcription-arrested as well as in [3H]uridine pulse-labeled hepatocytes about 2.5-fold from 80 to 190 min. It is concluded that angiotensin II induces an increase in angiotensinogen synthesis in hepatocytes by stabilizing of angiotensinogen mRNA and that this effect is mediated through inhibition of adenylylcyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1507502433,"The genes for the type IV collagen alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains are regulated by a common alpha 130-base pair (bp) bidirectional promoter. In an attempt to explore the regulation of expression of both genes, we have constructed a minilocus plasmid containing minigenes for the human alpha 1 (IV) and alpha 2(IV) collagen genes located head-to-head like the endogenous genes. The directional regulation of this promoter was studied by introducing site-directed mutations into the promoter of the minigenes. In transient transfections the levels of transcripts of both minigenes were measured, and the influence of mutations on the direction of transcription was studied. The mutational analysis showed that a CCCTCCC motif and a GC box located in the center of the common promoter as well as GC boxes in exon 1 of the alpha 2(IV) gene are potent activating elements for both genes. The promoter of the alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) collagen genes contains no classical TATA boxes. Even so, A+T-rich sequence motifs, which have no obvious homology to the TATA box located 25-30 bp upstream of exon 1 in each gene, direct the initiation of transcription predominantly about 30 bp downstream of their location. Disruption of the A+T-rich sequence decreased the activity of the promoter considerably, and in addition, the generated classical TATA boxes hindered maintenance of normal bidirectional transcription and changed the ratio of the alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) transcripts. The CCAAT box in the alpha 2(IV) chain coding strand activated the promoter in the alpha 2(IV) gene direction, but not in the alpha 1(IV) gene direction."
https://openalex.org/W1598785238,"The effect of purinergic compounds on [Ca2+]i and membrane currents of cell lines derived from the airway epithelium of normal and cystic fibrosis individuals has been investigated. 2-Chloroadenosine (2-CADO), as well as other agonists of the A1 adenosine receptors, causes a transient elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] that is antagonized by the A1 adenosine receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3 dipropylxanthine (DPCPX). ATP is also effective, but at a lower extent. The [Ca2+]i increase induced by 2-CADO and ATP is abolished by preincubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. This latter result suggests that purinergic agonists mobilize Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive stores. Pertussis toxin completely inhibits the effect of 2-CADO, whereas only it partially affects that of ATP, suggesting the involvement of different types of G proteins. Perforated patch clamp experiments carried out in both current clamp and voltage clamp modes show that 2-CADO and ATP activate K(+)- and Cl(-)-selective membrane currents, with a mechanism inhibited by preincubation with DPCPX and thapsigargin. These data indicate that activation of adenosine A1 receptor, in a similar way to ATP receptor, causes [Ca2+]i increase and ion channels activation through a transduction mechanism that is not impaired in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1502183505,"The molecular basis of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-negative deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) has been investigated. Several classes of mammalian ADHs have been recognized based upon biochemical and structural properties. ADH cDNA clones identified by hybridization to a mouse class I ADH cDNA clone were obtained from a deer mouse ADH-positive liver cDNA library. This cDNA has been identified as being a class I sequence and represents the deer mouse Adh-1 gene. An additional cDNA sequence identified in both the ADH-positive and -negative deer mouse cDNA libraries was identified by weak cross-hybridization to the mouse cDNA. This cDNA encodes an amino acid sequence representing a new class of mammalian ADH, and the deer mouse gene for this ADH is named Adh-2. ADH-negative deer mice do not produce mRNA, that is detected by the Adh-1 cDNA probe. However, both stocks of deer mice produce high levels of Adh-2 mRNA in liver. Southern analysis using an essentially full-length Adh-1 cDNA probe has shown that the Adh-1 gene is deleted in the ADH-negative mice. Biochemical analysis of enzyme activity suggests at least three ADH polypeptides are expressed in different tissues and have somewhat different substrate specificities, as in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1552746786,"POU homeodomain proteins are important regulators of ubiquitous as well as tissue-specific transcription. These factors include the broadly expressed octamer motif-binding protein Oct-1 and the related cell-specifically expressed protein Oct-2. These two proteins differ in the types of octamer motif-containing promoters they preferentially activate; Oct-1 can activate RNA polymerase II transcription from a small nuclear RNA promoter better than Oct-2, which can better activate an mRNA-type promoter. We describe a variant Oct-1-encoding cDNA resulting from two separate alternate splices of the human oct-1 primary transcript; these alternate splices were present in all cell lines tested. This cDNA encodes an amino-terminally and carboxyl-terminally truncated form of Oct-1, called Oct-1B, which retains the DNA-binding POU domain and acquires a unique 12-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension. In a transient expression assay, Oct-1B displayed an enhanced ability compared to the larger form of Oct-1 (called Oct-1A in this report) to activate the human histone H2B promoter, an mRNA-type promoter where a natural octamer motif is involved in cell cycle dependent transcription. Thus, the ability of Oct-1 related proteins to activate a natural regulatory target can be influenced by alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1616658513,"We completely sequenced the human gene for ATP synthase gamma-subunit, which was approximately 23 kilobases long and was composed of 10 exons. Exons 1 and 2 encoded the N-terminal presequence required for mitochondrial import, while exons 9 and 10 encoded the C-terminal portions of mature protein. Enzymatic amplification of human heart and liver cDNAs using the polymerase chain reaction revealed two mRNA transcripts that were predicted to encode two 30-kDa isoforms of the gamma-subunit, which differed by the addition of a single amino acid (Asp273) at the C terminus of the liver type isoform. These two mRNA transcripts of the heart (H) type and liver (L) type were generated by alternative splicing of an exon. The same alternative splicing event was observed in bovine tissue. In human tissues, the H type mRNA devoid of exon 9 was expressed specifically in the heart and skeletal muscle, which require rapid energy supply. The L type mRNA was expressed in the brain, liver, kidney etc. Both transcripts were expressed in the skin, intestine, stomach, and aorta. This tissue specificity of transcript heterogeneity suggests the distinct functional or regulatory roles of the gamma-subunit isoforms in the catalysis of ATP synthase. This is the first report on tissue-specific isoforms generated by alternative splicing in an energy transducing mitochondrial protein."

Histologically the tumors arose from the intermediate lobe, contained nuclear SV40 T antigen and POMC peptides, but did not express other pituitary hormones. POMC processing in the pituitary tumors was indistinguishable from normal mouse intermediate lobe melanotrophs and was characterized by high proportions of acetylated and carboxyl-terminal shortened beta-endorphins, and amino-terminal acetylated alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and virtually no adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)(1-39), beta-lipotropin, or POMC. The tumors contained abundant levels of mRNA for the prohormone convertase PC2 and undetectable levels of PC1. Normal mouse neurointermediate lobe also has a high ratio of PC2/PC1 expression that is distinct from the relative abundance of PC1 in anterior lobe and AtT-20 corticotroph cells. In contrast, extracts from tumors transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice contained predominantly nonacetylated forms of beta-endorphin(1-31) and -(1-27), very little ACTH(1-39), almost no corticotropin-like intermediate peptide or alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and higher proportions of intact POMC. Surprisingly, despite the less efficient proteolytic cleavage, a transplanted tumor expressed both PC1 and PC2. These studies are the first biochemical documentation of a melanotroph pituitary tumor in a rodent species and provide a new model for the investigation of pituitary oncogenesis and the molecular basis of tissue-specific prohormone post-translational processing."
https://openalex.org/W1561568242,"Inside-out sealed membrane vesicles were prepared from strains of Escherichia coli engineered to be lacking in the major phospholipid of this organism, phosphatidylethanolamine (DeChavigny, A., Heacock, P. N., and Dowhan, W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5323-5332). The energy transducing properties, namely the ability to generate a proton gradient directed inward and to transport electrons to molecular oxygen, were compared to those of membranes isolated from wild type cells containing normal levels of phosphatidylethanolamine. Membranes from both cell types were equal in their ability to oxidize succinate and lactate as well as hydrolyze ATP with the generation of proton gradients of similar magnitude, thus establishing the structural integrity of the membrane barrier and basic functionality of the energy transducing systems in the mutant membranes. However, mutant membranes were reduced by about 80% in their type II NADH dehydrogenase-dependent oxidase activity which resulted in a reduced ability to generate a proton gradient using NADH as an energy source. Use of artificial electron acceptors indicated that the level of type II NADH dehydrogenase activity was normal. Whole chain NADH oxidase activity could be restored by addition of short chain analogs of the naturally occurring Q8, even though the level of the Q8 pool in both cell types was the same. These results suggest that the function of Q8 in linking type II NADH dehydrogenase with the terminal oxidase(s) is dependent on the phosphatidylethanolamine content of the surrounding phospholipid matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1599384904,"Transcription initiation of the gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is stimulated by glucocorticoids and glucagon, via cAMP, and dominantly inhibited by insulin in rat liver and H4IIE cells. Lysolecithin-permeabilized H4IIE cells recover completely and continue to multiply, yet are transiently penetrable by macromolecules. These cells, after various hormonal treatments, were utilized for in situ DNase I protection studies of the PEPCK promoter. Nearly all of the sites of protein interaction observed in vitro are protected in vivo as well as several additional sites. The DNase I protection pattern is the same in cells without or with any of the hormone treatments, suggesting that hormonal modulation of transcription does not involve addition or removal of factors from the hormone response elements of the promoter. We focused on the organization and stability of the transcription initiation complex as well as the dynamic nature of distal promoter factors in their interaction with DNA. The transcription initiation complex was detected, and it appears to be co-existent with a short region of naked single-stranded DNA over the TATA box on the template strand, as determined by potassium permanganate reactivity. This complex is quite stable, even under conditions of much reduced RNA synthesis, which suggests that the complex is not broken down and reformed with each round of initiation by RNA polymerase II. Other factors bind to the PEPCK promoter with half-lives ranging from a few minutes to more than 40 min. The cAMP response element apparently involves transcriptional modulation achieved through modification of a bound factor (presumably cAMP response element-binding protein), whereas the glucocorticoid/insulin-responsive region of the promoter functions through factors which are involved in a rapid exchange, suggesting quite different modes of transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1599608260,"The vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme is a heterodimeric protein containing subunits of 97 and 33 kDa, the products of genes D1R and D12L, respectively. The enzyme catalyzes the first three reactions in the mRNA cap formation pathway: mRNA triphosphatase, guanyltransferase and (guanine-7-)methyltransferase. The guanyltransferase reaction proceeds by way of a covalent enzyme GMP (E-GMP) intermediate (Shuman, S. and Hurwitz, J. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 187-191) in which the GMP is linked to the large subunit through a lysine residue (Toyama, R., Mizumoto, K., Nakahara, Y., Tatsuno, T., and Kaziro, Y. (1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 2, 2195-2201; Roth, M. J., and Hurwitz, J. (1984) J. Biol Chem. 259, 13488-13494). In order to identify the map position of the guanyltransferase active site lysine residue, high specific activity [32P]E-GMP was prepared. Digestion of the E-GMP with hydroxylamine at pH 9.5 yielded a 31-kDa radioactive fragment derived from amino acids 1-273. Cleavage of E-GMP with cyanogen bromide produced a radioactive peptide of 14 kDa corresponding to amino acids 242-365. Lysine residues are found at positions 244 and 260. Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion of cyanogen bromide-cleaved E-GMP yields a radioactive product of about 5 kDa in molecular mass corresponding to the peptide generated by cleavage at glutamic acid residues 253 and 297, demonstrating that lysine 260 is the site of linkage of GMP."

The present report describes the purification to near homogeneity and characterization of a protein tyrosine phosphatase from Xenopus laevis eggs that dephosphorylates MAP kinase phosphorylated by MEK. Bacterially expressed Xenopus MAP kinase phosphorylated by purified Xenopus MEK was used as substrate throughout the purification. The purification procedure included anion-exchange, cation-exchange, gel filtration, heparin-Sepharose, and chromatography on a column of thiophosphorylated MAP kinase-Sepharose, resulting in a > 3000-fold purification. Upon analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a protein of 47 kDa correlated with activity. The phosphatase showed absolute specificity toward phosphotyrosine and no activity toward phosphothreonyl-phosphoseryl residues of MAP kinase. The pH optimum of the enzyme was 7.0 with a Km of 9.0 microM for phosphorylated MAP kinase. The phosphatase was inhibited by ammonium molybdate (IC50, 2 microM), vanadate (IC50, 250 microM), millimolar concentrations of MnCl2, ZnCl2 and p-nitrophenylphosphate but not by okadaic acid or microcystin.

https://openalex.org/W1589568489,"Guanine-nucleotide exchange is the reaction that controls the activation of H-ras p21. This reaction is stimulated by the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor. In this study we show that H-ras p21 harboring guanine ring binding domain (the conserved NKXD motif) mutations, such as N116I or K117E, are potent inhibitors of H-ras p21 guanine-nucleotide exchange reaction promoted by SDC25C (Saccharomyces cerevisiae SDC25 C-domain gene product), a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor. The inhibition is due to the formation of a stable but catalytically inactive complex consisting of the H-ras mutant and SDC25C. By examining the interaction of v-H-ras(N116I) or v-H-ras(K117E) with SDC25C at different concentrations of guanine-nucleotide, we demonstrate that the mechanism of SDC25C-promoted guanine-nucleotide exchange proceeds through the following pathway. First, SDC25C binds to H-ras and forms an intermediate H-ras.SDC25C complex; subsequently, an incoming guanine-nucleotide dissociates the complex, releasing SDC25C from H-ras and causes guanine-nucleotide exchange. This mechanism is similar to the one proposed for Escherichia coli elongation factor Ts-catalyzed guanine-nucleotide exchange."

In LLC-PK1 renal cells, vasopressin-stimulated adenylylcyclase activity is regulated in part, by the counterbalancing activity of stimulatory G-proteins (Gs) and inhibitory pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins (Gi). Two Gi genes encoding the Gi isoforms G alpha i-2 and G alpha i-3 are expressed in LLC-PK1 cells. In polarized cells, these isoforms are topographically segregated to different membranes, which allows for the selective inhibition of adenylylcyclase by G alpha i-2. The genes encoding these isoforms are similarly regulated in these cells during growth and differentiation but differ in response to steroid hormone signals (Holtzman, E.J., Kinane, T.B., West, K., Soper, B.W., Karga, H., Ausiello, D.A., and Ercolani, L. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3964-3975). We now demonstrate after stimulating polarized LLC-PK1 cells with forskolin, which raises intracellular cAMP levels 50-fold, G alpha i-2 but not G alpha i-3 protein is increased 3-fold at 12 h and remains elevated above control values by 24 h. In cells stably transfected with G alpha i-2 or G alpha i-3 gene 5'-flanking sequences fused to firefly luciferase cDNA reporter gene, forskolin treatment increased G alpha i-2 transcription 3-fold but inhibited G alpha i-3 transcription by 50% at 12 h. In vivo footprinting of forskolin-treated cells was performed to examine the molecular basis for activation of the G alpha i-2 gene. Protected guanosines were identified in a 135-base pair (bp) area previously associated with enhancer activity of this gene in non-polarized cells. This DNA segment did not contain the classical cAMP response element 5'-TGACGTCA-3'. Utilizing the 135-bp DNA segment as a probe in mobility shift assays, which compared nuclear extracts from cells before and after forskolin treatment, an induced nuclear protein complex was identified. Following systematic reduction and mutation of this DNA segment, a box motif was identified that bound the induced nuclear protein complex during forskolin-induced G alpha i-2 gene transcriptional activation. Induction of this nuclear protein complex was prevented in forskolin-treated cells by cycloheximide. To demonstrate functional activity of the CCAAT box motif, cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding either the minimal 135-bp segment or a multimerized CCAAT box segment fused to a Rous sarcoma minimal promoter/firefly luciferase reporter gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1584615787,"The Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene mat-Mc plays a determinative role in the sexual differentiation of the fission yeast. The mat-Mc protein has been suggested to belong to a novel family of so-called high mobility group (HMG) box proteins, characterized by homology to high mobility group-1 and -2 proteins. Several HMG box proteins, including the mammalian sex-determining gene product SRY and the lymphoid transcription factors TCF-1 and LEF-1, have been shown to bind to DNA in a sequence-specific fashion. To analyze possible DNA-binding properties of mat-Mc, we have cloned and expressed its putative HMG box in Escherichia coli. Gel retardation analysis revealed that the mat-Mc HMG box recognizes the AACAAAG heptamer in a sequence-specific fashion. Combined T-->C and A-->I substitutions on both strands of the AACAAAG heptamer, which change the surface of the major groove while leaving the minor groove intact, did not interfere with sequence-specific binding of mat-Mc. Methylation interference analysis confirmed that the mat-Mc HMG box contacts adenine residues in the minor groove. By using a circular permutation assay, the mat-Mc HMG box was observed to bend DNA. These results indicate that mat-Mc is indeed a member of the HMG box family with DNA-binding characteristics assigned earlier to other members of this novel transcription factor family."
https://openalex.org/W1592779284,"Mitochondrial DNA polymerase from Drosophila embryos has been characterized with regard to its mechanism of DNA synthesis under the influence of a variety of compounds in moderate salt (120 mM KCl), where the enzyme is most highly active and only moderately processive, and in low salt (30 mM KCl), where it is less active yet most highly processive. Disparate activity and processivity optima were obtained in low salt in the presence of varying pH or MgCl2 and ATP concentrations; in moderate salt, optimal activity and processivity were achieved coincidentally. Whereas no correlation between processivity and activity optima was observed upon addition of polyethylene glycol in either low or moderate salt, the optima were coincident at both salt levels on addition of glycerol. None of the reaction conditions examined allowed DNA polymerase gamma to exhibit maximal activity and processivity concurrently; maximal activity was always achieved in moderate salt and the highest processivity in low salt. However, while limiting the availability of primer termini had no effect on the mechanism of DNA synthesis, we found that the ability of mitochondrial DNA polymerase to copy singly primed M13 DNA was enhanced then diminished during the course of purification, suggesting loss of an accessory factor."

The kinetics of the bacterial luciferase reaction were measured by stopped-flow spectrophotometry at pH 7 and 25 degrees C for the series of aldehydes from n-heptanal to n-undecanal. The rate of formation of the 4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate was dependent on the aldehyde concentration when mixtures of enzyme, FMNH2, and aldehyde were rapidly mixed with O2. At saturating aldehyde, the rate of formation of this intermediate was 100-fold slower than in the absence of aldehyde, demonstrating that an enzyme. FMNH2.aldehyde complex can be formed. Numerical simulation of the time courses for these experiments supported the formation of this intermediate and its direct reaction with O2. The kinetics of the light emitting reaction were dependent upon the chain length of the aldehyde substrate. Although the initial light intensity and the light emission decay rate were different for each aldehyde, the quantum yield for the reaction was independent of the aldehyde used. Luciferase was inhibited by high levels of the aldehyde substrate when the enzyme was assayed by mixing FMNH2 with an aerobic mixture of enzyme and aldehyde. The extent of inhibition was dependent on the particular aldehyde used, and the binding affinity of the aldehyde for the free enzyme increased in parallel with the aldehyde chain length. The kinetics of the formation and decay of the various intermediates were also studied in the presence of n-alkyladehyde analogs. These compounds decreased the rate of formation of the 4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate in much the same way as the aldehyde substrate, presumably by the formation of the enzyme.

This amino acid had been previously identified as particularly sensitive to mutation (McCormick, K. A., and Cain, B. D. (1991) J. Bacteriol. 173, 7240-7248). Mutant uncF (b) genes were placed under control of the lac promoter and monitored for F1F0 ATP synthase function in an uncF(b) deletion strain. Three deleterious bAla-79 mutations were moved to the unc operon in the chromosome by homologous recombination. Decreases in enzymatic activity in the uncF (b) mutant strains resulted from reduced amounts of enzyme. With the exception of the bAla-79-->Pro mutation, high expression of mutant uncF (b) genes resulted in increases in F1F0 ATP synthase activity which were sufficient to overcome the defects. In addition to the decrease in the amount of enzyme, the bAla-79-->Lys mutation affected ATP synthesis to a much greater extent than ATP-driven proton translocation. The evidence supports our earlier hypothesis, in which bAla-79 was proposed to play an important, but not essential, structural role in F1F0 ATP synthase assembly or stability."

The activator, which requires detergent (polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether) for release from clathrin-coated vesicles, is heat-stable, trypsin-sensitive, and has an apparent molecular mass of about 6 kDa as determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The activator stimulates the purified H(+)-ATPase of coated vesicles over 50-fold under acidic conditions. Similarly, the activator stimulates proton pumping catalyzed by the reconstituted proton pump. Importantly, this stimulation of proton pumping is observed only when the activator is reconstituted into the interior of the proteoliposomes. Moreover, the activator protein is demonstrated to protect, and co-sediment with, purified proton pump during glycerol gradient centrifugation performed in the presence of ATP. These observations support the notion that this activator serves to determine the pH set point of acidic endomembranes through interactions with the transmembranous sectors of the proton pump."

Reduction of the dehydrogenase with SL- proceeded via two phases. From the kinetic difference spectra obtained, the faster and slower phases of reduction represent that of one of the iron-sulfur centers and of FAD, respectively. The rate constant of the faster phase increased with the concentration of the enzyme, suggesting that the reduction follows a bimolecular reaction of SL- with the iron-sulfur center. In contrast, the rate constant of the slower phase (510 s-1) was independent of the concentration of the enzyme at pH 7.5. In order to elucidate the contribution of the molybdenum site in the reaction, a similar reaction was performed with enzyme modified with oxipurinol. In the modified enzyme, the slower phase was lost, whereas the faster phase was not affected. These results suggest that the slower phase is due to intramolecular electron transfer from the molybdenum center to FAD. On the other hand, NAD. reacted predominantly with FAD of the dehydrogenase to form the neutral semiquinone of FAD with a second order rate constant of 1.4 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 at pH 7.5, whereas a similar reaction in the oxidase, which was converted from xanthine dehydrogenase by proteolytical cleavage, was not observed. This suggests that NAD. transfers an electron via the binding site for NAD+ on the dehydrogenase. In contrast, NMA radical reduced only an iron-sulfur center of the dehydrogenase with a second order rate constant of 6.5 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 at pH 7.5."

Concentrations of thapsigargin as low as 10-25 nM primed PMN for both PAF production and [3H]arachidonate release in response to the chemotactic peptide (fMLP), whereas concentrations in the range 25-200 nM induced a time- and dose-dependent production of PAF, which occurred in the absence of both [3H]arachidonate release and [3H]phosphatidylethanol formation. Studies in fura-2/AM-loaded cells showed that concentrations of thapsigargin that elicited PAF production induced a protracted and long lasting elevation of cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) between 200 and 700 nM. The lower concentrations primed the cells for a late [Ca2+]i elevation in response to fMLP similar to that elicited by cytochalasin B or ionomycin. PAF production showed a good correlation with the increase of [Ca2+]i (r = 0.91) irrespective of the procedure used to grade [Ca2+]i. In contrast, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate failed to induce both PAF production and elevation of [Ca2+]i, but it was a very effective stimulator of [3H]arachidonate release and [3H]phosphatidylethanol production. These data indicate that PAF production and [3H]arachidonate release in PMN differ in both biochemical pathway and modulatory mechanisms. Whereas PAF production seems extremely sensitive to changes in [Ca2+]i, which seems to exert its modulatory effect at the lyso-PAF:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase step, [3H]arachidonate release seems tightly modulated by protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms and is coincidental with activation of phospholipase D."

These oligonucleotides were used as polymerase chain reaction primers on whole genomic DNA from Klebsiella oxytoca. This resulted in an 82-base pair DNA fragment that was used as a hybridization probe to obtain a clone of the E-1 gene from a K. oxytoca gene library. The DNA sequence of the E-1 coding region was determined, and the amino acid sequence of E-1 was deduced. E-1 appears to represent a novel class of enzymes since no homology to known enzymes was found. Cloning the gene from K. oxytoca on a multicopy plasmid leads to overproduction of E-1 enzyme that has properties indistinguishable from those of the enzyme from K. pneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W1486745754,"ATP induces structural alterations in SV40 large T antigen and promotes changes in its interaction with the viral replication origin. We have analyzed nucleotide-induced changes in T antigen structure in the absence of origin DNA. Most preparations of immunopurified T antigen contain several discrete species ranging in size from monomers through oligomers larger than hexamers. The predominant species consist of monomers and dimers. Incubation of T antigen with ATP or dATP leads to a dramatic and rapid increase in the appearance of T antigen hexamers. Weakly and nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP are effective as well, indicating that hexamer formation does not require active ATP hydrolysis. After incubation of T antigen with [gamma-35S]ATP, stable association of the labeled nucleotide with all detectable forms occurs. Removal of greater than 80% of the T antigen phosphate residues does not significantly affect the formation of T antigen hexamers, although changes in the distribution and mobility of the other species of T antigen are apparent. Furthermore, T antigen synthesized in and purified from Escherichia coli and, therefore, presumably un- or underphosphorylated, is capable of forming hexamers. Nucleotide-induced T antigen hexamer formation thus appears to require neither protein phosphorylation nor active ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1570435661,"The functional roles of Val37 and Gly38 in porcine cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase have been studied in the site-directed mutants V37A, G38A, and G38S where the size and hydrophobic character of these residues has been altered. Previous x-ray studies have shown that Val37 and Gly38, which are part of a flexible loop, interact directly with bound substrate. From x-ray and solution experiments we find that the V37A, G38A, and G38S mutations do not cause significant perturbations to the unliganded enzyme. Replacing Val37 with a less bulky alanine residue does not affect the maximal catalytic rate (kcat), but it does increase significantly the Michaelis constants for substrates in the overall transamination reaction between aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate. On the other hand, replacing Gly38 with alanine or serine results in striking decreases in kcat to 5 and 0.6%, respectively, of the value observed for the wild-type enzyme, as well as in considerable increases in Km values. Consequently, the catalytic competence, kcat/Km, decreases by 3 orders of magnitude for G38A and by 4 orders of magnitude for G38S. Single turnover reactions of G38A and G38S with four individual substrates (aspartate, glutamate, oxalacetate, and 2-oxoglutarate) are characterized by kinetic parameters that are largely consistent with those of the overall reaction. In addition, the mutations at position 38 impair more seriously the catalytic competence of the enzyme toward C5-substrates than toward C4-substrates. We conclude that Gly38 is probably required for proper function of the enzyme because it permits a high level of flexibility for the 36-39 peptide, which in turn allows the essential substrate-induced movement of the small domain."
https://openalex.org/W1520714676,"4-Fluoro-7-sulfamoylbenzofurazan (ABDF) has a rather small fluorophore that is linked directly to the sulfur atom of thiols without a flexible alkyl chain (Imai, K., and Toyo'oka, T. (1987) Methods Enzymol. 143, 67-75). In the present study I examined the fluorescent and chemical properties of ABDF as an environmentally sensitive probe for Cys-707 (SH1) of myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) to monitor the behavior of SH1 associated with ATP hydrolysis. ABDF was very stable to long irradiation and nonfluorescent before attachment to thiols, permitting the continuous monitoring of the labeling reaction. The fluorophore was useful as an environmentally sensitive probe for thiol groups in proteins. SH1 of S-1 was specifically labeled with ABDF. When ATP, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, and ADP were added to the labeled S-1 (ABD-S-1), the fluorescence intensity at 500 nm increased by 110, 66, and 53%, respectively. Binding of actin to ABD-S-1 resulted in a decrease in the fluorescence by 30%. The fluorophore attached to SH1 was found to be located in a more hydrophobic environment in the presence of ATP than in the absence of ligand. KI fluorescence quenching studies suggested that the binding of ATP causes a movement of SH1 toward a more hydrophobic protein interior, whereas it goes back to the opposite direction after ATP hydrolysis. Thus, ABDF is very useful as an environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe for SH1 that monitors ligand-induced changes in the behavior of the thiol."
https://openalex.org/W1597659200,"In a previous study of mutations in trfA, the gene encoding the replication initiation protein of the broad host-range plasmid RK2, a carboxyl-terminal deletion of 3 amino acids of the TrfA protein was found to be completely nonfunctional for RK2 replication in Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria. In this work site-directed mutagenesis of the trfA gene was carried out to construct TrfA proteins altered in the three carboxyl-terminal positions. Specifically, TrfA proteins with deletions or substitutions of the terminal cysteine, lysine, and arginine (codons 380-382, respectively) were constructed and characterized for their ability to initiate replication from an RK2 origin in vivo in E. coli, Azotobacter vinelandii, Pseudomonas putida, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens and for binding activity to the iterons at the replication origin. Substitutions of the cysteine at position 380 with a glycine or an arginine resulted in a TrfA protein defective in binding to the RK2 origin and, therefore, defective in replication initiation activity in all four Gram-negative bacteria. Substitution of a serine at that position preserved limited function in replication and DNA binding. The lysine at position 381 could be changed to a glutamine without any obvious change in TrfA function. Deletion of the terminal arginine at position 382 did not affect the ability of TrfA to bind to origin iterons but caused a complete loss of replication activity in all four bacteria. Substitution of this terminal arginine with alanine, serine, or glutamic acid also produced replication-defective TrfA protein in all four bacterial hosts while not affecting iteron binding activity. However, substitution of this arginine with a lysine resulted in a loss of replication activity in E. coli and A. vinelandii but had no effect in P. putida and A. tumefaciens. These observations suggest that the terminal arginine plays an essential role in the activity of the TrfA protein, possibly interaction with host proteins, which can be separated from its iteron binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1513436357,"The three-dimensional structure of bovine plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) complexed with N-ethyl retinamide has been determined at 1.9-A resolution. The crystals of the complex (space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), a = 46.27, b = 49.11, c = 76.41 A) are isomorphous with those of bovine holo and apoRBP. The final crystallographic R factor is 0.172 for 11,261 observed reflections. The model of the retinoid-RBP complex is nearly identical to that of bovine retinol-RBP complex; the root mean square deviations between the alpha-carbons in the two proteins is 0.15 A. The N-ethyl retinamide molecule fits in the beta-barrel in the same position previously occupied by the vitamin. The ethyl group of the retinoid replaces the retinol hydroxyl group and a water molecule hydrogen bonded to it. This substitution has no consequence on the overall conformation of the protein. The modification of the functional end group of retinol does not lead to an apparent loss of affinity of the retinol analog for apoRBP, as established by means of fluorometric titrations with N-ethyl retinamide. However, the binding of the retinoid to RBP abolishes or greatly reduces the affinity of RBP for transthyretin. This behavior further supports the hypothesis that the area of the entrance of the beta-barrel, which includes the ethyl group of the retinoid bound to RBP, is involved in the interaction with transthyretin. Moreover, it indicates a high degree of complementarity of interacting surfaces between RBP and transthyretin. In fact, the replacement of the retinol hydroxyl group and quite small structural changes in the above region of the RBP molecule drastically affect the protein-protein recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1487297285,"Using a human autoimmune CREST antiserum, we identified a 97-kDa polypeptide in Tetrahymena cilia at the plus ends of ciliary microtubules and mammalian kinetochores (Miller, J. M., Wang, W., Balczon, R., and Dentler, W. L. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 703-714). In this study, we examined the interactions of the ciliary 97-kDa protein with microtubules assembled from purified bovine brain tubulin. The 97-kDa protein binds to microtubules and is released from them with 75 mM MgCl2, the same condition used to release it from ciliary microtubules. The 97-kDa protein-microtubule association can be disrupted by ATP and by adenosine 5'-O-(thio-triphosphate), and this ATP sensitivity requires a soluble factor in the crude 97-kDa protein fraction. Fractionation of the crude 97-kDa protein fractions by gel filtration chromatography or by sucrose gradient centrifugation causes the loss of the microtubule binding activity of the 97-kDa protein. Fractions containing a high molecular weight protein complex (molecular mass, approximately 1500-2000 kDa) from the column or gradient fractions can restore the microtubule binding ability of the 97-kDa protein. These results suggest that the 97-kDa protein is part of a high molecular weight protein complex and that the complex, not the 97-kDa protein alone, is required for the 97-kDa protein-microtubule association. The association of the 97-kDa protein with microtubules is sensitive to ATP, which suggests that the 97-kDa protein-microtubule interaction may be regulated by an ATPase(s) or protein kinase(s)/phosphatase(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1569678580,"The effect of binding of platinum antitumor drugs, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cis-DDP) and Pt-pentamidine, on the Z-DNA reactivity of potential Z-DNA forming sequences has been studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results indicate that cis-DDP and Pt-pentamidine increase the Z-DNA reactivity of plasmids containing a (dG-dC)16 insert (pUCZ8) and a native Z-DNA forming sequence of Drosophila hydei (pF18). The molar ratio of platinum bound to nucleotides (rb) to produce 50% of Z-DNA reactivity was 0.10 for cis-DDP:pF18, 0.15 for Pt-pentamidine:pF18, and 0.10 for cis-DDP:pUCZ8 and Pt-pentamidine:pUCZ8. The efficacy of Pt-pentamidine to provoke Z-DNA reactivity is 2.5-fold higher than that of cis-DDP. While Pt-pentamidine was capable of inducing Z-DNA reactivity in a GC-rich DNA sequence of the hsp 70 protein of Trypanosoma cruzi (p2M4EO3) and in sequences of pUC8, cis-DDP suppresses Z-DNA reactivity. CD spectra of poly(dG-me5dC).poly(dG-me5dC) modified by the drugs suggest that the increase in Z-DNA reactivity observed in plasmids upon drug binding may be due to shifting towards Z-DNA or a Z-DNA like conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1876043563,"Abstract During the activation of rat thymocytes elicited by stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and calcium ionophore A23187, the total amount of gangliosides per cell was demonstrated to increase, reaching a maximum level several times higher than that of resting cells at 48 h after activation when measured at 24-h intervals. The amount of the overwhelmingly predominant ganglioside in resting thymocytes, GD1c (NeuGc,NeuGc) (Nohara, K., Suzuki, M., Inagaki, F., and Kaya, K. (1991) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 110, 274-278), was found to increase further as a result of activation. Furthermore, another ganglioside, which was barely recognizable in resting thymocytes, was found to increase in activated and proliferating thymocytes to a level similar to that of GD1c. This activation-associated ganglioside was isolated and its structure examined. On the basis of the results of compositional analysis, methylation analysis, sialidase hydrolysis followed by detection with cholera toxin B subunit on TLC, and proton NMR spectroscopy, this ganglioside was clarified to be a rare species of GD1b containing two N-glycolylneuraminic acid residues. On the other hand, when the thymocytes were activated using concanavalin A (ConA) as a stimulant, the amount of gangliosides per cell was increased more strikingly than that in thymocytes activated with TPA and A23187. In the ConA-activated thymocytes, many other gangliosides, in addition to GD1c and GD1b-(NeuGc,NeuGc), were demonstrated to appear in large amounts. The cause of this difference in gangliosides between thymocytes activated with a combination of TPA and A23187 and those activated with ConA is also discussed."
