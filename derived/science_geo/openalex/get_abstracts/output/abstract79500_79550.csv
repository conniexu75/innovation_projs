https://openalex.org/W1531198291,"Abstract The positional and stereochemical specificities of the soybean lipoxidase-catalyzed oxygenation of unsaturated fatty acids have been investigated. It was found that the oxygen function was introduced at position ω6 in all of the fatty acids which reacted. In one case a small amount of the substrate was oxygenated in position ω10. The structural requirement for substrates is the presence of a cis, cis-1,4-pentadiene group with its methylene group located in position ω8. The structure of the hydroperoxy acid formed from 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid was 15l-hydroperoxy-8(cis), 11(cis),13(trans)-eicosatrienoic acid. By using sterospecifically tritium-labeled 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acids, it was found that the removal of hydrogen from the ω8 methylene group is stereospecific. Thus, only the hydrogen of the l configuration is removed by the enzyme during the conversion into 15l-hydroperoxy-8(cis), 11(cis),13(trans)-eicosatrienoic acid. The conversion of [13l-3H, 3-14C]8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid is accompanied by an isotope effect, suggesting that the hydrogen removal occurs as the initial step of the reaction."

Incubation of [13d-3H,3-14C]- and [13l-3H,3-14C]8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acids showed that the hydrogen removed from C-13 during the conversion into PGE1 and PGF1α has the l configuration. The conversion of [13l-3H,3-14C]8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid into PGE1 is accompanied by a hydrogen isotope effect. No conversion of [2-14C]15l-hydroperoxy-8(cis),11(cis),13(trans)-eicosatrienoic acid or [2-14C]15l-hydroxy-8(cis), 11(cis),13(trans)-eicosatrienoic acid into PGE1 or PGF1α could be detected. Incubations of [9-3H,3-14C]8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid revealed that PGF1α is not formed via PGE1 in the system used. The mechanistic implications of the results obtained are discussed. It is suggested that 11-peroxy-8,12,14-eicosatrienoic acid is the first intermediate in the conversion. The peroxy acid is cyclized into an endoperoxide, which is eventually transformed into PGE1 or PGF1α by independent reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1540977682,"Abstract The association constants with lysozyme of several saccharides containing N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid, have been determined by fluorescence spectroscopy or, in one case, by equilibrium dialysis experiments. The association data may be understood on the assumption that the active site of lysozyme consists of a number of subsites binding individual 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucopyranose rings. On the basis of these data, we have drawn detailed conclusions about the specificity of the individual subsites and their contributions to the total binding energy of oligosaccharide substrates and inhibitors. These conclusions are consistent with, and offer further support of, the mechanism of lysozyme action deduced by Phillips and his coworkers on the basis of x-ray crystallographic studies."
https://openalex.org/W1768176260,"Abstract The disaccharide unit of the glomerular basement membrane has been studied in regard to its detailed structure and its linkage to the peptide portion. Graded acid hydrolysis of glycopeptides containing this unit resulted in a more rapid release of glucose than galactose and indicated that glucose was in the external position. Isolation of a disaccharide consisting of glucose and galactose with galactose in the reducing position confirmed the sequence of the unit. Studies by methylation, periodate oxidation, and galactose oxidase treatment of the isolated disaccharide, as well as of glycopeptides containing it, indicated that the glucose is linked glycosidically to C-2 of the galactose. The anomeric configuration of this linkage was shown to be α on the basis of studies with α- and β-glucosidases. These findings indicated that the isolated disaccharide was 2-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-d-galactose. Alkaline hydrolysis of glycopeptides or of the entire basement membrane permitted isolation of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine in 80 to 90% yield. Upon mild acid hydrolysis of this compound, glucose was released preferentially, and galactosylhydroxylysine was obtained in about 80% yield. Studies of N-acetylated glycopeptides indicated that the stability to acid of the galactosylhydroxylysine bond is markedly influenced by the charge on the e-amino group of the hydroxylysine. Both α- and β-galactosidases were used to study the anomeric configuration of the galactosylhydroxylysine linkage. The β-galactosidase was effective in cleaving this bond, but only when the galactosylhydroxylysine was in its N-acetylated form. These studies are consistent with the following structure for the disaccharide unit and its peptide attachment: 2-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-O-β-d-galactopyranosylhydroxylysine. Measurement of the glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine content of the basement membrane could be performed directly on the amino acid analyzer after alkaline hydrolysis of the basement membrane. Such analyses indicated that there are 14.5 disaccharide units per 100 mg of the basement membrane (17.3/1000 amino acid residues). All of the glucose of the basement membrane occurs in the form of this hydroxylysine-linked disaccharide unit. The disaccharide units could be removed from the peptide chain by a single Smith degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2151350796,"Abstract The Ehrlich cell has a component of transport, for which alanine, serine, and cysteine are preferred substrates, which is not reactive with α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid or N-methylalanine and is only weakly reactive with other methylamino acids and glycine. Although the new component is similar to one described before (the so-called A system) as to its rate, its dependence on the presence of Na+, its low sensitivity to irradiation, and other properties, nevertheless it shows a distinctly lower pH sensitivity, a somewhat lower sensitivity to metabolic inhibitors, and a much higher stereo-specificity than the A system. Furthermore, part of the exodus of alanine shows a stereospecificity corresponding to the new system, suggesting that the new system operates more reversibly than the A system. Systems with similar properties and substrate specificities occur in the rabbit reticulocyte and the pigeon erythrocyte, in the absence of any system reactive with N-methylalanine or α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid. From these considerations, we conclude that the new system and the A system very probably operate independently and not as a single complex transport system. Both of the amino acids that serve to suppress the A system selectively, namely α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid and N-methyl-l-alanine, show peculiarly low Vmax values for uptake by the Ehrlich cell."
https://openalex.org/W1543173789,"Abstract The products formed on oxygenation of certain unsaturated fatty acids in preparations of sheep vesicular gland have been studied. Oxygenation of linoleic acid yielded 9-hydroxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (82%) and 13-hydroxy-9, 11-octadecadienoic acid (18%). Oxygenation of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid yielded 11-hydroxy-8,12,14-eicosatrienoic acid, 15-hydroxy-8,11,13-eicosatrienoic acid, 12-hydroxy-8,10-heptadecadienoic acid, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), and prostaglandin F1α. The biosynthesis of 12-hydroxy-8,10-heptadecadienoic acid was studied with the use of [2-14C]-, [9-3H,3-14C]-, [10-3H,3-14C]-, [11-3H,2-14C]-, [13d-3H,3-14C]-, [13l-3H,3-14C]-, and [15-3H,3-14C]8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acids. These experiments showed that C-9, C-10, and C-11 are eliminated from the precursor and that the stereochemistry of the removal of hydrogen from C-13 is identical with that occurring during the biosynthesis of PGE1. The 3-carbon compound formed together with 12-hydroxy-8,10-heptadecadienoic acid from 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid was identified as malonaldehyde. The identification could be accomplished by condensing malonaldehyde with l-arginine, yielding δ-N-2(pyrimidinyl)-l-ornithine. The mode of formation of 12-hydroxy-8,10-heptadecadie-noic acid and malonaldehyde from 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid is discussed. The compounds are proposed to originate in a cyclic peroxide, which has earlier been postulated to be an intermediate in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins."
https://openalex.org/W1833525866,"The circular dichroism of variants of β-lactoglobulin has been measured and the over-all differences between the species were found to be small. The dichroic spectrum given by the aromatic residues in β-lactoglobulin B is shown to be decomposable into five negative dichroic peaks. These can be correlated with various types of chromophore residues, with the two strongest peaks, at 293 and 284 nm, being probably due to tryptophan. Changes in the spectrum, obtained as β-lactoglobulin is denatured by alkali and acidic methanol, are shown. The native protein has a negative dichroic peak in the vicinity of 215 to 220 nm, and with increasing pH, this peak shifts downward toward 201 nm and increases 4-fold in intensity. The positive dichroic peak at 196, seen in the native protein at pH values below 5, also is shifted to shorter wave lengths without, however, changing greatly in intensity. Acidic methanol, on the other hand, causes a conversion to a spectrum qualitatively like that of an α-helix, with negative maxima at 222 and 207 nm and a positive extremum at 193 nm. These changes are discussed in the light of the circular dichroic spectra of polypeptides in known conformations."
https://openalex.org/W1602467464,"Abstract Inhibitors of trypsin and chymotrypsin from several highly inbred genetic types of lima beans were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography. Six chromatographically distinct inhibitors were found in all cases. However, the relative distribution of these components fell into two types, dependent upon the variety of bean used. One milligram of one of the chromatographically homogeneous fractions inhibited 2.6 mg of bovine trypsin and 1.2 mg of α-chymotrypsin. The presence of a double-headed inhibitor was indicated, in which both inhibitory sites were present on the same molecule. The molecular weights of this fraction calculated from the amino acid composition and from the stoichiometry of trypsin inhibition were 9,670 and 9,050 g per mole, respectively. However, a molecular weight of 16,200 g per mole was found by the Ehrenberg method, and an s20,w value of 1.81 S was obtained. This indicates a possible aggregation or a molecular weight twice that indicated by the minimum one from amino acid analyses. Chemical modification of the amino groups of this fraction with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid completely destroyed the trypsin-inhibitory activity, with no effect on the chymotrypsin-inhibitory activity. Amidination of the amino groups, which results in no change in charge, also greatly lowered the trypsin-inhibitory activity. The results of the chemical modifications indicate that a fast reacting lysine residue is critical for the trypsin-inhibitory activity."
https://openalex.org/W2025010605,"IN 1940 Tinbergen1 and Kortlandt2 independently drew attention to a behavioural phenomenon which has since been called displacement activity and has received a good deal of attention3,4. Although no binding rules exist by which displacement behaviour can be recognized, the term is applied to behaviour patterns which appear to be out of context with the behaviour which closely precedes or follows them, either in the sense that they do not seem functionally integrated with the preceding or following behaviour or that they occur in situations in which causal factors usually responsible for them appear to be absent or at least weak compared with those determining the behavioural envelope. Displacement activities occur in three situations: motivational conflict, frustration of consummatory acts and physical thwarting of performance. Several theories have been put forward to explain the causal mechanism involved5–8. A variety of behaviour patterns have been reported as displacement activities9, even in a single species, but this variety needs revision10. Monographic treatments of the behaviour of any one species usually indicate only two or three activities which according to the judgment of the observer occur commonly as displacement. None of the theories on displacement activities gives cogent reasons why particular behaviour patterns should be more common than others as displacement activities, apart from stating that the causal agents which usually elicit them in non-displacement situations can also be presumed to be present, if only weakly, in the displacement context, or remarking that these patterns are prepotent in the repertoire of the animal."
https://openalex.org/W1706313231,"Absorption, optical rotatory dispersion, and circular dichroism data are presented for the oxidized and reduced states of the heme undecapeptide of cytochrome c. The absence of aromatic residues, disulfides, and ionizable sulfhydryl groups allows unambiguous determination of the heme absorptions to 240 mµ. As the electronic transitions within the heme are made optically active by the covalently attached peptide, it is possible to detect bands not readily resolved from absorption data. An absorption maximum is seen at 277 mµ which is labeled the e hemochromogen band. In the presence of imidazole, optically active bands are found in the ferroheme undecapeptide with extrema at 263 mµ, 278 mµ, 317 mµ, and 353 mµ. The ferriheme undecapeptide exhibits a positive circular dichroism band at 253 mµ and a broad negative extremum in the 320- to 360-mµ wavelength range. These bands, including those which are found in the wavelength range normally reserved to the aromatic amino acids, are due to the heme chromophore. At shorter wavelengths it is shown that the absorption at 190 mµ cannot be adequately accounted for by the peptide moiety and the carboxyls of the propionic acid heme substituents, that is, 25 to 50% of the absorption at 190 mµ is due to heme, the coordinated imidazole, and the thiol ether groups. The circular dichroism in the peptide region is dependent on the oxidative state and indicates changes directly involving the heme moiety either electronically or sterically. The bands observed in the heme peptides are briefly compared to qualitatively similar bands in cytochrome c, myoglobin, and hemoglobin. The distinctive feature in the circular dichroism of the heme proteins is the presence of localized bands which correspond to vibrational bands present in the aromatic amino acids. The vibronic bands should allow assessment of environmental changes in the corresponding amino acids."

At the same time the membrane capacitance is markedly reduced and hyperpolarizing current pulses no longer produce a slow, progressive increase in potential (creep). The large capacitance of muscle and the phenomenon of ""creep"" must both depend on an intact transverse tubular system."

https://openalex.org/W1510168465,"Abstract An examination is made of the fractionation of a crude thrombin preparation obtained by bioactivation, namely, Parke Davis thrombin, topical. Columns of carboxylic resin, cellulose phosphate, diethylaminoethyl cellulose, and Sephadex G-100 were studied. The starting material and all products obtained by using only carboxylic resin or cellulose phosphate are shown to be impure and to contain a nonenzymatic inhibitor. A simple procedure is given for isolating a stable thrombin of high, constant specific activity. The procedure involves removal from solution, first, of inhibitor and some nonthrombin protein by DEAE-cellulose at pH 7, Γ/2 = 0.1 (phosphate), and 23°. A cellulose phosphate column is next used under the same conditions to adsorb thrombin and pass some nonthrombin protein. After additional inactive protein is washed off at pH 7 and Γ/2 = 0.15, thrombin is eluted at Γ/2 = 1.0 to give stock thrombin. The procedure at this point gives a minimum yield of 91.1 ± 8.4% of the original activity. Gel filtration of stock thrombin on Sephadex G-100 separates an average additional 24% of the absorbance of stock thrombin as an inactive protein and gives a single thrombin peak. By comparison with known proteins the peak position corresponds to a molecular weight of 36,000 ± 1,600 (95% confidence limits). The last 0.6 of the peak has constant specific activity which corresponds to 1,160 ± 130 NIH units per absorbance unit or 2,260 ± 250 NIH units per mg. At ionic strength 1.0, pH 7, and 4°, stock thrombin preparations lose activity to the maximum extent of 0.1% per week. At Γ/2 = 0.1, pH 7, and 23°, diluted stock thrombin (20-sec clotting time) loses 1.6% of its activity per day. This is shown not to be due to an inhibitor, an extraneous enzyme, or the presence of 5 x 10-4 m KCN, which had to be added to prevent bacterial growth. The mechanism appears to be a zero order denaturation. Attempts to concentrate stock thrombin by ammonium sulfate precipitation or osmotic solvent removal have frequently led to the production of inactive aggregates. Acetone precipitation from 0.15 m calcium chloride at pH 7 has been successful in giving concentrations up to 10 absorbance units per ml."

In the native state, this form is in rapid, pH-dependent equilibrium with the monomeric species. A stable dimer is formed under mild oxidizing conditions. Analysis of the protein by peptide mapping indicated that the monomers are identical. Polarographic analysis for metal ions showed that the enzyme contains 1 zinc ion per monomer."

https://openalex.org/W1582398179,"Abstract The basic trypsin inhibitor of bovine pancreas (Kunitz and Northrop inhibitor) has five amino groups, provided by a single NH2-terminal arginyl residue and 4 lysyl residues. When the free inhibitor is allowed to react with N-carboxy-dl-alanine anhydride all five amino groups are blocked. In contrast, when the reaction is performed with the trypsin-bound inhibitor, lysine 15 is unmodified and therefore is shielded by trypsin in the complex. It may be concluded that this lysyl residue is involved in the interaction between inhibitor and trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1487566879,"Abstract Soybean tissues requiring cytokinins for growth in vitro were incubated on media containing 6-benzylaminopurine labeled with 14C in either the purine ring (8-14C), the side chain (methylene-14C), or the benzene ring (benzene-14C). In each case radioactivity was incorporated into RNA; the bulk of the incorporated material appeared to be the nucleotide of 6-benzylaminopurine on the basis of anion exchange and paper chromatographic procedures. Methylated albumin chromatography indicated that nearly all of the 14C was in the soluble RNA (sRNA) fraction. Further chromatography of the 14C-labeled sRNA on columns of O-benzoyldiethylaminoethyl cellulose resulted in the appearance of six subfractions, only one of which contained 14C. It is therefore suggested that cytokinins may be incorporated preferentially into certain sRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1992641125,"Polar lobes of eggs of the mud snail Ilyanassa obsoleta, detached at the ""trefoil"" stage of the first cleavage, are capable of incorporating labeled amino acid into protein. The rate of incorporation per unit volume is about half that of the whole egg. The ability to incorporate at a similar rate persists for at least 24 hours after isolation. The sum of the incorporation of isolated lobes and lobeless fragments approximates that of the whole egg. The results extend to this material (the anucleate polar lobe) evidence for long-lived messenger RNA. They suggest also that the demonstrated morphogenetic influence of the lobe, which is exerted primarily during cleavage, may be correlated with its ability to synthesize protein."

https://openalex.org/W1567118861,"Abstract The ultraviolet solvent perturbation difference spectrum of horse heart ferricytochrome c in 20% ethylene glycol is equivalent to that calculated for 2 tyrosyl and no tryptophanyl residues. Two of the 4 tyrosyl residues are iodinated by reaction of the protein with potassium triiodide. These results indicate that 2 of the tyrosyl residues of ferricytochrome c are located on the protein surface. Treatment of the protein with N-bromosuccinimide oxidizes the tryptophanyl residue and both methionyl residues. Changes in the reduced viscosity, ionization of the phenolic hydroxyl groups, visible absorbance spectrum, and exposure of the heme moiety indicate that oxidation of the tryptophanyl residue and the buried methionyl residue is due to a partial unfolding of the native conformation of ferricytochrome c."

https://openalex.org/W2094486582,"Increased mechanical fragility of the sickled red cell is thought to be important in the genesis of the hemolytic process in sickle-cell disease. Sickled cells were observed cinematographically after microincision by a ruby-laser beam. Distortion and charring invariably occurred at the site of injury, and with small injuries there was no further cell change. With larger injuries, variably rapid retraction of spicules occurred accompanied by sphering of the cell. In some cases, progressive loss of hemoglobin accompanied and followed the changes in shape; in others the sphered cell still contained hemoglobin. Regardless of the mecha nisms involved in these changes in vitro, the observations may be applicable to destruction of sickled cells in vivo. We suggest that the cells are subject to avulsion of rigid cellular processes as a result of mechanical injury incurred in normal circulation. Such injured cells may undergo either immediate hemolysis or trans formation into spherocytes which are subject to erythophagocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1610597612,"Abstract Purified preparations of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase of the respiratory chain, extracted with the aid of phospholipase at moderate temperature, do not catalyze the reduction of long chain coenzyme Q derivatives (Q6 and Q10) at significant rates and are not inhibited by amytal or rotenone. On exposure of the enzyme to conditions which have been used for the extraction of NADH-coenzyme Q reductase (pH 5.4, 9.5% ethanol 43° for 15 min) the characteristic properties and catalytic activities of the dehydrogenase are lost and a high catalytic activity toward coenzyme Q6 and Q10 emerges, along with cytochrome c reductase activity. The NADH-coenzyme Q reductase activity created by this treatment is comparable to that obtained on direct extraction of submitochondrial particles with acid-ethanol at 43° and is inhibited by amytal and rotenone to the same extent as NADH-coenzyme Q reductase. The lack of rotenone- and amytal-sensitive coenzyme Q reductase activity in NADH dehydrogenase is not due to the exposure of the preparation to pH 8.5 or to phospholipase A, as has been suggested by other authors, since submitochondrial particles isolated at pH 8.5 and at neutral pH are equally good sources of soluble NADH-coenzyme Q reductase and since neither cobra venom nor its constituent phospholipase A inhibit or inactivate soluble NADH-coenzyme Q reductase. The reason why venom treatment of particles interferes with subsequent extraction of NADH-coenzyme Q reductase by heat-acid-ethanol is that an inhibitor is formed by the venom, which can be removed, however, with the aid of serum albumin. Evidence is presented that the reaction sites of long chain coenzyme Q homologues and of rotenone and amytal in soluble NADH-coenzyme Q reductase are not the same as in intact mitochondria and submitochondrial particles. Soluble NADH-coenzyme Q reductase resembles closely in its known properties NADH-cytochrome c reductase and, like the latter enzyme, may be regarded as a fragment of NADH dehydrogenase created by exposure to heat-acid-ethanol."
