https://openalex.org/W1554578780,"Biochemical and pharmacological data support the existence of multiple forms of the Na/H exchanger (NHE). Two isoforms, termed NHE-1 and NHE-2, have recently been isolated from rabbit ileal villus epithelial cells (Tse, C. M., Ma, A. I., Yang, V. W., Watson, A. J. M., Levine, S., Montrose, M. H., Potter, J., Sardet, C., Pouyssegur, J., and Donowitz, M. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 1957-1967; Tse, C. M., Watson, A. J. M., Ma, A. I., Pouyssegur, J., and Donowitz, M. (1991) Gastroenterology 100, A258). To identify additional molecular forms of the exchanger, rat brain, heart, kidney, stomach, and spleen cDNA libraries were screened for their presence using an NHE-1 cDNA probe under low stringency hybridization conditions. cDNAs encoding rat NHE-1 and two structurally related proteins, designated NHE-3 and NHE-4, have been isolated. Based on the deduced amino acid sequences, NHE-1, -3, and -4 are similar in size, having relative molecular masses of 91,506, 92,997, and 81,427, respectively. Overall, the proteins exhibit approximately 40% amino acid identity to each other and have similar hydropathy profiles, suggesting that they have the same transmembrane organization. The predicted N-terminal transmembrane regions of the three proteins, which span between 453 and 503 amino acids, exhibit the highest degree of identity (45-49%). In contrast, the C-terminal cytoplasmic regions, which span between 247 and 378 amino acids, exhibit very low amino acid identity (24-31%). Tissue distribution studies reveal that the NHE-1 mRNA is present at varying levels in all tissues examined, whereas NHE-3 and NHE-4 mRNAs exhibit a more limited distribution. NHE-3 mRNA is expressed at high levels in colon and small intestine, with significant levels also present in kidney and stomach. NHE-4 mRNA is most abundant in stomach, followed by intermediate levels in small intestine and colon and lesser amounts in kidney, brain, uterus, and skeletal muscle. These data suggest that the molecular basis for the functional diversity of the Na/H exchanger in mammals is based, at least in part, on expression of multiple members of a gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1515081605,"We have previously cloned a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (versican) from human fibroblasts. The primary sequence shows that the N terminus contains sequence homology with known hyaluronate-binding molecule, suggesting that versican can bind hyaluronate. To test this hypothesis we have reconstructed a full-length versican cDNA and a versican cDNA fragment encoding the N terminus and have transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, respectively, with these constructs. The transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells make a proteoglycan shown to be versican by enzymatic and immunologic analysis. No corresponding proteoglycan was seen in the control cells. Using hyaluronate affinity chromatography, we show that recombinant versican specifically binds hyaluronate and does not bind to heparin or chondroitin sulfate. The transfected fibroblasts make a 78-kDa truncated form of versican that also binds hyaluronate and does not bind the related polysaccharides, showing that the hyaluronate binding activity resides at the N terminus of versican. The binding of versican to hyaluronate is substrate-concentration dependent and time dependent and can be competed with unlabeled versican. The dissociation constant for versican binding to hyaluronate was determined to be 4 x 10(-9) M."
https://openalex.org/W1599577400,"A group of similar proteins, namely BSP-A1, BSP-A2, BSP-A3, and BSP-30-kDa (collectively called BSP proteins), are the major proteins found in bovine seminal fluid. These proteins are secretory products of seminal vesicles, and they bind to spermatozoa upon ejaculation, suggesting that there are binding sites for these proteins on the spermatozoa. It was of interest to characterize these binding sites on spermatozoa which may help in the elucidation of the biological function of BSP proteins. The binding sites on spermatozoa are resistant to protease or acid treatment and are heat-stable but extractable with organic solvents. The solvent-extractable material, when coated on plastic microtitration wells, binds radiolabeled BSP proteins thus indicating the lipid nature of the BSP binding sites on spermatozoa. We investigated the specificity of interaction of BSP proteins with lipids using liposomes of phospholipids, solid-phase, and thin-layer chromatography-overlay techniques. Results showed that BSP-A1, -A2, and -A3 proteins bound specifically to those phospholipids which contain the phosphorylcholine group. In contrast, BSP-30-kDa protein preferentially bound to phospholipids containing the phosphorylcholine moiety but also interacted with phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, and cardiolipin. Furthermore, of those lipids that were extracted from spermatozoa, only phospholipids which contain the phosphorylcholine moiety bound radiolabeled BSP proteins. These data suggest that the BSP protein binding sites on spermatozoa are phospholipids. We propose that this specific interaction plays an important role in the membrane modification of spermatozoa that occurs during capacitation and/or acrosome reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1602825981,"The N-terminal domain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) integrase (IN) contains the sequence motif His-Xaa3-His-Xaa23-Cys-Xaa2-Cys, which is strongly conserved in all retroviral and retrotransposon IN proteins. This structural motif constitutes a putative zinc finger in which a metal ion may be coordinately bound by the His and Cys residues. A recombinant peptide, IN(1-55), composed of the N-terminal 55 amino acids of HIV-1 IN was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Utilizing a combination of techniques including UV-visible absorption, circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared, and fluorescence spectroscopies, we have demonstrated that metal ions (Zn2+, Co2+, and Cd2+) are bound with equimolar stoichiometry by IN(1-55). The liganded peptide assumes a highly ordered structure with increased alpha-helical content and exhibits remarkable thermal stability. UV-visible difference spectra of the peptide-Co2+ complexes directly implicate thiols in metal coordination, and Co2+ d-d transitions in the visible range indicate that Co2+ is tetrahedrally coordinated. Mutant peptides containing conservative substitutions of one of the conserved His or either of the Cys residues displayed no significant Zn(2+)-induced conformational changes as monitored by CD and fluorescence spectra. We conclude that the N terminus of HIV-1 IN contains a metal-binding domain whose structure is stabilized by tetrahedral coordination of metal by histidines 12 and 16 and cysteines 40 and 43. A preliminary structural model for this zinc finger is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1493020321,"A peptide derived from p34cdc2, cdc2(6-20)NH2 with the amino acid sequence of KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK-amide, was found to be a specific and efficient substrate for a pp60c-src-related protein tyrosine kinase from bovine spleen (STK). Glu-12 and Thr-14 were identified to be substrate specificity determinants in this peptide (Cheng, H.-C., Litwin, C. M. E., Hwang, D. M., and Wang, J. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 17919-17925). In this study, we demonstrated the presence of cdc2(6-20)NH2 peptide tyrosine kinase activity in the membrane fractions of bovine brain, spleen, thymus, lung, liver, and kidney. Hydroxylapatite column chromatography of thymus membrane extract revealed four protein tyrosine kinases, TK-I, TK-II, TK-III, and TK-IV, with different relative activities toward cdc2(6-20)NH2 and a general tyrosine kinase substrate, poly(Glu/Tyr). Only TK-I and TK-II showed significant activity toward cdc2(6-20)NH2, they were suggested as belonging to the src-family by virtue of their cross-reactivity with an antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a conserved sequence of src-family kinases. Further immunological characterization using antibodies specific to individual src-related protein tyrosine kinases suggested that TK-I, TK-II, and STK are bovine homologs of p56lck, p55fyn, and p56lyn, respectively. Substrate specificity and kinetic characterization of src-family tyrosine kinases including human platelet pp60c-src, bovine p56lyn, p56lck, and p55fyn, as well as several non-src-related tyrosine kinases including epidermal growth factor receptor, p43v-abl, TK-III, and TK-IV showed that all the src-family tyrosine kinases but none of the other kinases displayed efficient cdc2(6-20)NH2 phosphorylation. In all cases, the high efficiency of cdc2(6-20)NH2 peptide phosphorylation could be markedly attenuated when Glu-12 and Thr-14 of the peptide were substituted, respectively, by valine and serine."
https://openalex.org/W1537048205,"Four polymorphic variants of the platelet receptor for von Willebrand factor, glycoprotein Ib, have been described that differ in molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (Moroi, M., Jung, S. M., and Yoshida, N. (1984) Blood 64, 622-629). A recent report localized the polymorphic site to the heavily O-glycosylated region of the glycoprotein Ib alpha-chain known as the macroglycopeptide (Meyer, M., and Schellenberg, I. (1990) Thromb. Res. 58, 233-242). This region contains several tandem repeats of a mucin-like sequence, which appeared to be a likely site for polymorphic variation. We amplified genomic DNA corresponding to the macroglycopeptide from 206 individuals from four ethnic groups and identified three length variants based on the migration of the amplified DNA on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. DNA sequencing revealed that the three variants represented four alleles, two of which varied by only one base pair, a difference that did not result in an amino acid change. The three length variants differed in the number of tandem repeats of a 39-base pair sequence that results in perfect duplication of a 13-amino acid sequence that originated within a region flanked by Glu-396 and Thr-411. The smallest isoform contained one such sequence; the next largest, two repeats; and the largest, three repeats. The DNA sequence containing the tandem repeats was flanked by direct repeats typical of the target site duplications found flanking transposed DNA, suggesting a mechanism for acquisition of this region by the primordial glycoprotein Ib alpha precursor. The amino acid sequence of the repeated element that accounts for the polymorphism contained five sites for potential O-glycosylation, which together with the repeated amino acids would result in incremental differences in molecular weight of approximately 6,000 between the different isoforms. The addition of repeats to the macroglycopeptide is predicted to increase the length of this elongated glycosylated region and extend the distance between the ligand-binding domain of glycoprotein Ib and the platelet plasma membrane, an effect that would project the ligand-binding domain farther into the bloodstream. Such a change may alter the susceptibility of platelets to shear-induced activation, a process that requires an interaction between glycoprotein Ib and von Willebrand factor."
https://openalex.org/W1559595253,"Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a recently identified, potent vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) mitogen of macrophage origin. To determine whether this gene is transcribed and regulated in vascular endothelial cells, we measured HB-EGF mRNA levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by RNA blot analysis with an HB-EGF cDNA probe. The base-line level of HB-EFG mRNA in HUVEC in culture was low. However, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta markedly increased HB-EGF mRNA levels in HUVEC by 12- and 7-fold, respectively, and induction of the gene by TNF-alpha was both dose- and time-dependent. In response to TNF-alpha, HB-EGF mRNA levels quickly increased and peaked at 1 h, indicating that HB-EGF belongs to the family of immediate early genes. In nuclear run-off experiments, TNF-alpha increased the rate of HB-EGF gene transcription by 3.2-fold. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that the HB-EGF gene is transcribed in vascular endothelial cells. The inducible transcription of this potent SMC mitogen gene in endothelial cells suggests that HB-EGF may have an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1499693169,"Abstract The enzyme 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) transferase is encoded by the kdtA gene of Escherichia coli and plays a key role in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. It transfers Kdo from CMP-Kdo to lipid A or its tetraacyldisaccharide-1,4'-bisphosphate precursor, lipid IVA. Using a strain that overproduces the transferase approximately 500-fold, we have purified the enzyme to near homogeneity. The subunit molecular mass is approximately 43 kDa. Activity is stimulated by Triton X-100, is maximal at pH 7, but does not require Mg2+. The apparent Km values for lipid IVA and CMP-Kdo are 52 and 88 microM, respectively. Vmax is 15-18 mumol/min/mg when both substrates are added near saturation at pH 8. The purified enzyme transfers 2 Kdo residues to lipid A precursors or analogs bearing four to six fatty acyl chains and a 4'-monosphosphate moiety. Activity is inhibited by polymixin B and Re endotoxin. At low Kdo concentrations small amounts of the intermediate, (Kdo)1-IVA, accumulate. When this substance is isolated and incubated with purified enzyme in the presence of CMP-Kdo, it is converted to (Kdo)2-IVA. Formation of (Kdo)1-IVA is also observed when purified enzyme is incubated with (Kdo)2-IVA and 5 mM CMP, demonstrating that Kdo transfer is reversible. In summary, Kdo transferase consists of a single bifunctional polypeptide that incorporates the 2 innermost Kdo residues common to all lipopolysaccharide molecules in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1594286037,"Protein kinase C (PKC) was found to be a zinc metallo-enzyme. Atomic absorption measurements on the intact enzyme indicated that four zinc atoms (4.2 +/- 0.5) were bound per PKC alpha molecule. Similar stoichiometric ratios were determined for PKC beta II and PKC gamma, other PKC isoforms individually expressed in the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, as well as for purified rat brain PKC. By trypsin treatment of PKC alpha, a 32-kDa lipid binding regulatory and a 50-kDa catalytic domain were generated that were subsequently completely separated by gel filtration in the presence of Triton X-100/phosphatidylserine mixed micelles. Zinc was present at levels significantly above background in fractions that contained the 32-kDa fragment and displayed phorbol ester binding activity. Lipid association and phorbol ester binding did not lead to displacement of zinc from the protein. The stoichiometry determined for this fragment (4.7 +/- 0.9) suggested that zinc was bound exclusively within the lipid binding regulatory domain of intact PKC. Furthermore, this stoichiometry is consistent with zinc being coordinated between 6 cysteine residues in a structural motif related to the Zn(II)2Cys6 binuclear cluster identified in the GAL4 transcriptional factor (Pan, T., and Coleman, J.E. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 2077-2081)."
https://openalex.org/W1515233283,"Diamines covalently coupled to glass substrates promoted human foreskin fibroblast adhesion in the absence of serum. These diamine-derivatized substrates were produced by coupling ethylene diamine, N-methylaminoethylamine, and N,N-dimethylaminoethylamine (NNDMAEA), to sulfonyl chloride-activated glass. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis demonstrated that the diamines were coupled via their primary amine ends to produce a surface-bound secondary amine linked to a free amino moiety via a two-carbon spacer. NNDMAEA-modified substrates containing free tertiary amines supported the highest degree of cell spreading (73 +/- 7% actively spreading cells) and the most extensive cytoskeletal organization. Both the free tertiary and surface-bound secondary amines were shown to be required for cell spreading. Lysine- and arginine-grafted substrates supported cell spreading and cytoskeletal organization similar to that on NNDMAEA-modified substrates. Although some stress fibers were observed within spread cells on these substrates, focal contacts did not form. Heparinase treatment did not inhibit cell attachment or spreading to the diamine-derivatized substrates, however chondroitinase ABC inhibited cell attachment and spreading on all substrates; heparinase inhibited spreading on lysine- and arginine-derivatized substrates to a lesser extent. These results imply that cell attachment to these substrates was mediated primarily by cell surface chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. This study demonstrates that covalently grafted NNDMAEA, lysine, and arginine can mimic the adhesion-promoting activity of the glycosaminoglycan-binding domains of cell adhesion proteins. This study also demonstrates that the interaction with these proteoglycans depends in a very sensitive manner on the particular structure of the immobilized amine."
https://openalex.org/W1574928949,"Abstract A strong positive element within the proximal promoter region of the human beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) gene that is required for high level expression in primary cultures of fetal rat heart cells was localized by transient assays and DNase I footprinting to positions- 277/-298. Using gel shift studies, this sequence was found to bind specifically at high affinity (Kd approximately 4 x 10(-9) M) to a transcriptional factor (beta F1) found in nuclear extracts from rabbit heart. Dimethyl sulfate interference studies suggested that beta F1 may bind as a dimer to two hexameric imperfect direct repeats containing the consensus sequence 5'-(C/G)-T-G-(T/A)-G-G-3'. Gel shift analyses suggested that beta F1 is related to the M-CAT factor, which is known to control muscle-specific expression of the cardiac troponin T gene. A clustered mutation of the region between the putative binding half-sites and within the M-CAT-like domain abolished beta-MHC promoter activity. The sequence of the positive element also contains binding motifs for several transcriptional factors that regulate viral and cellular genes, including AP4, AP5, TEF-1, and MyoD-like proteins. When multiple copies of the beta-MHC element were inserted downstream from the transcriptional initiation site of the thymidine kinase gene, it did not act as a classical enhancer, showing some dependence upon orientation."
https://openalex.org/W1537537396,"A set of wild-type and mutant human, woodchuck, and duck hepatitis viral core proteins have been prepared and used to study the free thiol groups and the disulfide bonding pattern present within the core particle. Human (HBcAg) and woodchuck (WHcAg) core proteins contain 4 cysteine residues, whereas duck (DHcAg) core protein contains a single cysteine residue. Each of the cysteines of HBcAg has been eliminated, either singly or in combinations, by a two-step mutagenesis procedure. All of the proteins were shown to have very similar physical and immunochemical properties. All assemble into essentially identical core particle structures. Therefore disulfide bonds are not essential for core particle formation. No intra-chain disulfide bonds occur. Cys107 is a free thiol buried within the particle structure, whereas Cys48 is present partly as a free sulfhydryl which is exposed at the surface of the particle. Cys61 is always and Cys48 is partly involved in interchain disulfide bonds with the identical residues of another monomer, whereas Cys183 is always involved in a disulfide bond with the Cys183 of a different monomer. WHcAg has the same pattern of bonding, whereas DHcAg lacks any disulfide bonds, and the single free sulfhydryl, Cys153 which is equivalent to Cys107 of HBcAg, is buried."
https://openalex.org/W1560398471,"The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) contains two tyrosine residues, Tyr668 and Tyr734. Previous work identifying Tyr734 as a critical residue in the endocytosis of the pIgR in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells also suggested that a second functional internalization signal was present (Breitfeld, P. P., Casanova, J. E., McKinnon, W. C., and Mostov, K. E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13750-13757). To test this hypothesis, Tyr668 and Tyr734 were mutated singly or together by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of pIgR cDNA, and the mutants were expressed in MDCK cells. The amount of ligand internalized within 5 min from the basolateral membrane by the pIgR in which cytoplasmic tyrosines were mutated separately to Cys668 or Ser734 or together to Cys668, Ser734 was 58, 39, and 20%, respectively, of the internalized by the wild-type pIgR. The cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the pIgR, when joined to the external domain of the influenza virus hemagglutinin, retained the capacity to mediate rapid internalization. As with the full-length pIgR, mutation of either tyrosine in the chimera resulted in impairment of endocytosis, with mutation of Tyr734 having a significantly greater effect than mutation on Tyr668 on the initial rate of endocytosis (3 and 44% of control values, respectively). However, unlike the full-length pIgR, mutation of both tyrosines together in the chimera did not reduce internalization further. The two tyrosines in the cytoplasmic sequence of the pIgR, although widely separated in the linear amino acid sequence, both contribute to internalization of the protein, suggesting that both can function as internalization signals. In addition, the correlation between endocytosis and basolateral targeting of the pIgR in MDCK cells was investigated. Neither tyrosine of the cytoplasmic domain was necessary for basolateral targeting of the pIgR."
https://openalex.org/W1485113741,"Binding specificity of the major surfactant protein SP-A from human and dog lung has been investigated. Radiobinding experiments have shown that both proteins bind in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner to galactose, mannose, fucose, and glucose linked to bovine serum albumin. These results are in accord with a previous study in which monosaccharides were linked to agarose (Haagsman, H. P., Hawgood, S., Sargeant, T., Buckley, D., White, R. T., Drickamer, K., and Benson, B. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 13877-13880). Chromatogram overlays in conjunction with in situ liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (TLC-LSIMS) of several purified glycosphingolipids and neoglycolipids as well as binding assays with glycolipids immobilized on plastic wells, demonstrate recognition of galactose (human and dog SP-A), glucose, and lactose (human SP-A) in association with specific lipids. In addition, the occurrence of several neutral and acidic glycosphingolipids in human and rat extracellular surfactants and rat alveolar type II cells is described. Selected components among the neutral glycolipids are bound by radiolabeled human SP-A; these are identified by TLC-LSIMS as predominantly ceramide mono- and disaccharides (human surfactant) and ceramide tri- and tetrasaccharides (rat surfactant and type II cells). A recombinant carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of human SP-A inhibits the binding of human SP-A to galactosyl ceramide and to galactose- and mannose-bovine serum albumin, indicating that the CRD is directly involved in the binding of SP-A to these ligands. These results provide evidence for a novel type of binding specificity for proteins that have Ca(2+)-dependent CRDs and raise the possibility that glycosphingolipids are endogenous ligands for SP-A."
https://openalex.org/W1519490780,"Studies of the biological chemistry of most anticancer drugs have revealed their cytotoxicity is expressed after the drugs have entered cells. It is thought that anthracycline antitumor drugs exert their cytotoxicity by entering cells, diffusing into nuclei, and inhibiting topoisomerase II and/or intercalating DNA base pairs. In order to deliver anthracyclines to transferrin (TRF) receptors on the plasma membranes of human tumor cells, we have prepared conjugates of adriamycin (ADR) with human TRF. These TRF-ADR conjugates were found to be stable at low pH and to exert more efficient cytotoxicity than free drug. By using spectrofluorometry, we found that the fluorescence of ADR within the conjugate was quenched by native DNA, demonstrating the presence of conformationally available drug to intercalate with nuclear DNA. However, fluorescence was not quenched when conjugate was reacted with viable cells, indicating that ADR did not reach the nucleus. Results of fluorescence microscopy experiments confirmed that free but not conjugated ADR reached the nuclei of viable cells, and TRF-ADR conjugates labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate were found to initiate lateral diffusion as determined by patch and cap reactions. The involvement of TRF receptors was shown by flow cytometry experiments in which native TRF inhibited binding of fluorescein-labeled TRF-ADR conjugates. These data suggest that TRF-ADR conjugates mediate cytotoxicity by a mechanism other than intercalation with nuclear DNA. This mechanism, revealed by conjugating ADR to a TRF carrier, may not initiate complications such as cardiotoxicity and drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1602084251,"Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II is a complex, multistep process which requires several accessory factors in addition to the polymerase itself. A critical event in transcription initiation is the specific association of RNA polymerase II with promoter DNA. In this report we show that three eukaryotic polypeptides, produced in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity, constitute a minimal set of general transcription factors both necessary and sufficient for specific and stable promoter binding by RNA polymerase II. These polypeptides are the yeast TATA box binding protein TBP, the human general initiation factor TFIIB, and human RAP30, the small subunit of RAP30/74 (or transcription factor IIF). Formation of the polymerase-containing complex required only the TATA box, and not the initiator element (Inr), of the adenovirus major late promoter which was used in these experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1878695667,"Human acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) is a leukocyte enzyme that hydrolyzes acyloxyacyl bonds in the lipid A region of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thereby detoxifying the LPS. We report here that the enzyme also acts in vitro on glycerophospholipids, lysophospholipids, and diacylglycerol. While AOAH preferentially removes palmitate or stearate from the sn-1 position of phospholipid and diacylglycerol substrates that have unsaturated acyl chains in the sn-2 position, it is able to cleave both palmitates from sn-1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol. This apparent preference for removing saturated (or shorter) acyl chains from glycerolipids is consistent with its ability to cleave laurate more rapidly than palmitoleate from lipopolysaccharide (Erwin, A. L., and Munford, R. S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16444-16449). AOAH also catalyzes acyl transfer from LPS and phosphatidylethanolamine to acceptor lipids; approximately equal amounts of laurate and myristate are transferred from LPS to monooleoylglyceryl ether, forming acyloleoylglyceryl ether. The demonstration that AOAH has phospholipase, lysophospholipase, diacylglycerol lipase, and acyltransferase activities in vitro suggests that the enzyme may have roles in addition to LPS deacylation (detoxification) in phagocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555342466,"In cells infected by influenza virus type A, host protein synthesis undergoes a rapid and dramatic shutoff. To define the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective translation, a transfection/infection protocol was developed utilizing viral and cellular cDNA clones. When COS-1 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding nonviral genes and subsequently infected with influenza virus, protein expression from the exogenous genes was diminished, similar to the endogenous cellular genes. However, when cells were transfected with a truncated influenza viral nucleocapsid protein (NP-S) gene, the NP-S protein was made as efficiently in influenza virus infected cells as in uninfected cells, showing that the NP-S mRNA, although expressed independently of the influenza virus replication machinery, was still recognized as a viral and not a cellular mRNA. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the selective blocks to nonviral protein synthesis were at the level of translation. Moreover, polysome experiments revealed that the translational blocks occurred at both the initiation and elongation stages of cellular protein synthesis. Finally, we utilized this transfection/infection system as well as double infection experiments to demonstrate that the translation of influenza viral mRNAs probably occurred in a cap-dependent manner as poliovirus infection inhibited influenza viral mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W1558979496,"The kinetic mechanism of the rod outer segment (ROS) isoprenylated protein methyltransferase was investigated. This S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-linked enzyme transfers methyl groups to carboxyl-terminal isoprenylated cysteine residues of proteins, generating methyl esters. The enzyme also processes simple substrates such as N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-L-cysteine (L-AFC). Initial studies showed that a ping-pong Bi Bi mechanism could be eliminated. In a ping-pong Bi Bi mechanism plots of 1/v versus 1/[substrate A] at different fixed substrate B concentrations are expected to yield a family of parallel lines whose slopes equal Km/Vmax. In fact, converging curves were found, which suggested a sequential mechanism. Dead-end inhibitors were used in order to further investigate the kinetic mechanism. S-Farnesylthioacetic acid is shown to be a dead-end competitive inhibitor with respect to the prenylated substrate L-AFC. On the other hand, S-farnesylthioacetic acid proved to be uncompetitive with respect to AdoMet, suggesting an ordered mechanism with AdoMet binding first. Further evidence for this mechanism came from product inhibition studies using the methyl ester of L-AFC (L-AFCMe) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy). Since AdoMet binds first to the enzyme, one of the products (L-AFCMe or AdoHcy) should be a competitive inhibitor with respect to it. It could be shown that AdoHcy is a competitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet, but L-AFCMe is a mixed-type inhibitor both with respect to AdoMet and to L-AFC. Therefore, AdoHcy combines with the same enzyme form as does AdoMet, and must be released from the enzyme last. Moreover, L-AFC and L-AFCMe must bind to different forms of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1590600623,"Assembly of RNA polymerase II with the core region of TATA box-containing promoters requires the action of the TATA factor and four transcription factors designated alpha, beta gamma, delta, and epsilon, which have each been purified to near homogeneity from rat liver. Evidence from previous studies argues that alpha and beta gamma play a crucial role in delivering RNA polymerase II to the promoter (Conaway, R. C., Garrett, K. P., Hanley, J. P., and Conaway, J. W. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 6205-6209). Here we describe the interaction of transcription factor delta with preinitiation intermediates assembled in the presence of either recombinant yeast TFIID or the high molecular mass, endogenous TATA factor tau from rat liver (Conaway, J. W., Hanley, J. P., Garrett, K. P., and Conaway, R. C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7804-7811). Results of template challenge experiments argue that delta enters the preinitiation complex through interactions with multiple components of the transcription apparatus. We observe that, in the presence of recombinant TFIID, delta interacts stably with the preinitiation complex only in the presence of RNA polymerase II, alpha, and beta gamma, whereas, in the presence of tau, delta is capable of interacting stably with the Initial Complex independently of RNA polymerase II. Results of restriction site protection experiments reveal that delta and epsilon promote binding of the transcription apparatus to the Initiator element and support the model that RNA polymerase II assembles at the core promoter in at least two discrete steps, first touching down near the TATA element and finally extending its interaction downstream to encompass the cap site."
https://openalex.org/W1571902940,"The nonactivated glucocorticoid receptor (Mr approximately 330,000, Strokes radius = 82 A) contained in cell extracts and complexed with a steroidal ligand was previously investigated by chemical cross-linking. It was identified as a heterotetramer composed of one receptor polypeptide, two molecules of the 90-kDa heat shock protein hsp90, and one 59-kDa protein subunit (Rexin, M., Busch, W., and Gehring, U. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 24601-24605). We now have used the cross-linking technique to investigate the receptor structure in intact WEHI-7 mouse lymphoma cells at 37 degrees C and under steroid-free conditions. Using immunochemical methods we show that the receptor present in whole cells likewise exists as a high molecular weight structure of Strokes radius 82 A. It has a subunit composition identical to that of the nonactivated receptor-steroid complex in cell extracts. This is the first account of a steroid hormone receptor in its native state as it is contained in target cells under physiological conditions and before a hormonal signal is received."
https://openalex.org/W1508336766,"A previous report from this laboratory (Reese, J.C., and Katzenellenbogen, B. S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10880-10887) identified an estrogen receptor (ER) mutant which had a similar binding affinity for estradiol as wild-type ER but displayed a dose-response shift for estradiol in transactivation studies. In this study, we have utilized hormone binding, DNA binding, and gene transfer experiments to further characterize this mutant, which contains an alanine substitution for a cysteine at amino acid 447 in the hormone binding domain of the receptor. Hormone binding studies indicate that the C447A receptor is a temperature-sensitive mutant, whose instability is only apparent at elevated temperatures, and that ligand can stabilize the mutant receptor. Western blot analysis reveals that the temperature-sensitive loss of hormone binding is not attributable to a degradation of receptor protein, but rather is an inactivation of the receptor's hormone binding ability. In addition to the loss in the hormone binding capacity of the C447A mutant, this mutant shows a temperature-sensitive loss in the DNA binding ability of the receptor. Transactivation profiles of the mutant and wild-type receptors demonstrate that incubation of transfected cells with increasing concentrations of estradiol at more ambient temperatures shifts the mutant receptor's dose-response curves to the left, converging on the wild-type curve. Hence, these transactivation studies reveal that the dose-response shift observed for this mutant in cells reflects the measured instability of the hormone binding and DNA interaction of the C447A mutant that can be demonstrated in vitro. In addition, this temperature-sensitive ER mutant is of interest in that its DNA binding is now ligand-dependent with the result that transcriptional activation now parallels receptor occupancy by ligand, which is similar to other steroid hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1577236142,"Abstract We have identified two intrinsically bent regions of DNA which flank the transcription start site of the rRNA gene from Physarum polycephalum. DNA fragments from both regions were analyzed by circular permutation polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay and computer modeling. Both types of analysis indicate that one fragment contains a relatively simple bend centered about 160 base pairs (bp) upstream of the transcription start site while the other fragment contains multiple bends, the most prominent of which is centered about 150 bp downstream of the start site. According to both gel mobilities and computer modeling we estimate that the net bending in each is about 45 degrees. These fragments were studied in detail by varying parameters of electrophoresis that are known to affect bending. Previous work indicates that anomalous mobility should decrease when temperature or ethidium bromide concentration is increased, whereas anomalous mobility should increase when polyacrylamide gel percentage is increased. The anomalous mobility of both fragments decreases as temperature is raised from 4 to 65 degrees C, although the bent structure centered at -160 bp is more temperature labile than the bend at +150 bp. Strikingly different behavior was observed for the two fragments as the polyacrylamide concentrations was varied. As polyacrylamide concentrations are increased from 6 to 10%, the anomalous mobility of the bend centered at -160 bp increases while that of the bend centered at +150 bp decreases. The bend centered at +150 bp is straightened at all ethidium concentrations tested. In sharp contrast and unexpectedly, the anomalous migration of the bend centered at -160 bp increases dramatically in 0.1 micrograms/ml ethidium bromide. Many of the mobility differences we observe suggest that the two regions studied represent structurally distinct forms of bent DNA. The location of these strongly bent regions on either side of a RNA polymerase I transcription start site suggests important roles for such structures in chromatin structure and transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2145137688,"We recently identified glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) as an insulin-regulated enzyme in adipocytes. Moreover, we found that loss of GFAT activity is not due to a direct action of insulin but rather is mediated by enhanced glucose uptake and the subsequent routing of glucose through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. To assess whether other cytosolic enzymes are controlled through formation of hexosamine products, we treated adipocytes for 5 h with physiological concentrations of insulin (ED50 = 0.33 ng/ml), glucose (ED50 = 4.5 mM), and glutamine (ED50 = 4.4 mM) and then measured pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Combined treatment resulted in a progressive (t 1/2 of 2.5 h) and marked (3-fold) increase in PK activity, whereas omission of one or more of these components failed to alter enzyme activity. Several lines of additional evidence implicated the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway in PK regulation; therefore, it appears that the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase represents another enzyme regulated by insulin through stimulation of glucose uptake and formation of hexosamine products. Related studies revealed that enhancement of PK activity is dependent upon ongoing mRNA synthesis and de novo protein synthesis and is mediated by an increase in enzyme content. Considered together, these findings provide new insights into the cascade of metabolic events triggered by insulin and implicated a novel metabolic pathway in the pretranslational control of enzyme function."
https://openalex.org/W1565547503,"N-Acetylneuraminic acid cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.43) (CAMP-NeuAc synthetase) from rat liver catalyzes the formation of cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid from CTP and NeuAc. We have purified this enzyme to apparent homogeneity (241-fold) using gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 and two types of affinity chromatographies (Reactive Brown-10 Agarose and Blue Sepharose CL-6B columns). The pure enzyme, whose amino acid composition and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence are also established, migrates as a single protein band on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular mass of the native enzyme, estimated by gel filtration, was 116 +/- 2 kDa whereas its Mr in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 58 +/- 1 kDa. CMP-NeuAc synthetase requires Mg2+ for catalysis although this ion can be replaced by Mn2+, Ca2+, or Co2+. The optimal pH was 8.0 in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ and 5 mM dithiothreitol. The apparent Km for CTP and NeuAc are 1.5 and 1.3 mM, respectively. The enzyme also converts N-glycolylneuraminic acid to its corresponding CMP-sialic acid (Km, 2.6 mM), whereas CMP-NeuAc, high CTP concentrations, and other nucleotides (CDP, CMP, ATP, UTP, GTP, and TTP) inhibited the enzyme to different extents."
https://openalex.org/W1554169017,"In the present work we have investigated the macromolecules that contribute to the brain 1H NMR spectrum. The cerebral cortex showed distinct resonances at the uncrowded methyl- and methylene chemical shift scale of the spin-echo 1H NMR spectrum. The peaks at 1.22 and 1.40 ppm (relative to the methyl protons of N-acetyl aspartate at 2.02 ppm) arise from cerebral macromolecules without evidence for co-resonances from low molecular weight metabolites as shown by the spin-spin relaxation decays of these resonances. In addition to these NMR signals, peaks at 0.9 and 1.7 ppm from macromolecules were detected. These resonances are from proteins, and we have identified the polypeptides that contributed to the 1H NMR peaks. Two proteins that were present at concentrations of 250 and 350 micrograms/g of dryed tissue showed 1H NMR spectra that resembled the macromolecular pattern in the cerebral 1H NMR spectrum. They were identified as thymosin beta 4 and histone H1, respectively. Thymosin beta 4 was present in soluble high speed cytoplasmic fraction and in P2 pellet, whereas histone H1 was detected in nuclear enriched fraction. A chemical shift-correlated two-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of thymosin beta 4 in vitro revealed a coupling pattern that matched the macromolecule in the cerebral cortex which we have previously noted (Kauppinen R. A., Kokko, H., and Williams, S. R. (1992) J. Neurochem. 58, 967-974). On the basis of both one- and two-dimensional NMR evidence, subcellular distribution and high concentration, we assign the 1H NMR signals at 0.9, 1.22, 1.40, and 1.7 ppm in the cerebral cortex to thymosin beta 4."
https://openalex.org/W1640981414,"A cell surface glycoprotein of apparent Mr 150,000 (gp150) has been implicated in mediating EDTA-resistant cell-cell adhesion in Dictyostelium discoideum. A simple purification scheme making use of high-performance liquid chromatography has been devised to purify gp150 to near homogeneity. Purified gp150 was capable of neutralizing the effect of a rabbit antiserum raised against gel-purified gp150, which was previously reported to be a potent inhibitor of cell-cell adhesion (Geltosky, J. E., Weseman, J., Bakke, A., and Lerner, R. A. (1979) Cell 18, 391-398). The binding of 125I-labeled gp150 to intact cells was both dose-dependent and saturable, demonstrating the presence of specific cell surface binding sites for gp150. When reassociation of postaggregation stage cells was carried out in the presence of soluble gp150, aggregate formation was strongly inhibited. In contrast, gp150 failed to exert any effect on cells at the aggregation stage. The inhibitory effect of gp150 was sensitive to protease treatment, suggesting that the protein moiety is crucial to gp150 function. These results, taken together, provide direct evidence that gp150 is a cell-cell adhesion molecule involved in cell-cell binding in the postaggregation stage of Dictyostelium development."
https://openalex.org/W1489774174,"The biosynthesis, post-translational modifications, and oligosaccharide structure of human CD8 glycoprotein have been studied in transfected rat epithelial cells. These cells synthesized and expressed on the plasma membrane high amounts of CD8 in a homodimeric form stabilized by a disulfide bridge. Three different CD8 forms were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis after metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation: a newly synthesized, unglycosylated 27-kDa (CD8u), a palmitylated and initially O-glycosylated 29-kDa (CD8i), and the mature, terminally glycosylated 32-34-kDa doublet (CD8m). CD8i is a transient intermediate form between CD8u and CD8m: characterization of carbohydrate moiety of [3H]glucosamine-labeled CD8i showed that it comprises for the vast majority non-elongated O-linked GalNAc closely spaced on the peptide backbone. Structural analysis of oligosaccharides released by mild alkaline borohydride treatment from the [3H]glucosamine-labeled CD8 34-kDa form showed that the neutral tetrasaccharide Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,6(Gal beta 1,3)GalNAcOH, and an homologous monosialylated pentasaccharide, predominate; the disialylated NeuAc2,3Gal beta 1,3(NeuAc alpha 2,6) GalNAcOH tetrasaccharide appeared to be poorly present. In the CD8 32-kDa form the neutral tetrasaccharide was by far the prominent O-linked chain, and no disialyloligosaccharides were identified. These results indicate that the maturation of CD8 glycoprotein in transfected rat epithelial cells results in the formation of branched O-linked oligosaccharides and that a higher degree of sialylation is responsible for the production of the heavier 34-kDa form."
https://openalex.org/W1680490931,"The transport of glycerolipid intermediates, viz. palmitoyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and lysophosphatidate from peroxisomes and their conversion to phosphatidate in endoplasmic reticulum (microsomes) were studied in cell-free systems. The lipids were biosynthesized from [32P]DHAP, palmitoyl-CoA, and freshly made rat liver peroxisomes and microsomes in the presence or absence of Mg2+, NADPH, and bovine serum albumin (BSA). After incubation, the soluble fraction and the membranes were separated, and the distribution of radioactive lipids in these fractions were determined. The results showed that palmitoyl-DHAP and lysophosphatidate were recovered in the supernatant when BSA was present or when BSA was absent, but Mg2+ was removed after incubation by chelation with EDTA (or ATP). At low optimum palmitoyl-CoA concentration or when palmitoyl-CoA was generated in peroxisomes, and in the absence of BSA, the biosynthesized keto ether and ester lipids and lysophosphatidate were similarly present in the supernatant. Phosphatidate, however, was always localized in the membranes. Further fractionation showed that phosphatidate was associated with the microsomes. The critical micellar concentrations of palmitoyl-DHAP and 1-palmitoyl-rac-glycerol 3-phosphate, under the incubation conditions used, were determined to be 58 and 70 microM, respectively. These results suggest that at physiological concentrations the biosynthesized lysolipids are water soluble, and therefore, a carrier protein is unnecessary for their transport. These lipids freely diffuse from peroxisomes to endoplasmic reticulum where they are converted to membrane-bound phosphatidate."
https://openalex.org/W1565240752,"Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), when incubated with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), shows a time-dependent loss of iodide oxidation activity. The inactivation follows pseudo-first order kinetics with a second order rate constant of 0.43 min-1 M-1 at 30 degrees C and is reversed by neutralized hydroxylamine. The difference absorption spectrum of the modified versus native enzyme shows a peak at 244 nm, characteristic of N-carbethoxyhistidine, which is diminished by treatment with hydroxylamine. Correlation between the stoichiometry of histidine modification and the extent of inactivation indicates that out of 2 histidine residues modified, one is responsible for inactivation. A plot of the log of the reciprocal half-time of inactivation against log DEPC concentration further suggests that only 1 histidine is involved in catalysis. The rate of inactivation shows a pH dependence with an inflection point at 6.2, indicating histidine derivatization by DEPC. Inactivation due to modification of tyrosine, lysine, or cysteine has been excluded. CD studies reveal no significant change in the protein or heme conformation following DEPC modification. We suggest that a unique histidine residue is required for maximal catalytic activity of HRP for iodide oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1515242611,"Muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChR) purified from chick heart were phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) and reconstituted with the purified GTP-binding regulatory protein Go. The effects of PKC phosphorylation on the interaction of mAChR with Go were assessed by monitoring for agonist-stimulated guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) binding to Go, agonist-stimulated GTPase activity of Go, and the capability of Go to induce high affinity agonist binding to mAChR. Both the receptor-stimulated GTP gamma S binding and GTPase activity of Go were markedly diminished as a result of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the mAChR, whereas the ability of Go to induce high affinity agonist binding to the receptors was unaffected. When mAChR were first reconstituted with Go and then subjected to phosphorylation with PKC, a complete inhibition of the phosphorylation of mAChR by PKC was observed. The inhibitory effect of Go on mAChR phosphorylation was concentration-dependent and was prevented by the presence of GTP gamma S in the reaction mixtures. Taken together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation of mAChR by PKC modulates receptor/G-protein interactions and that the ability of the receptors to act as substrates for PKC may be regulated by receptor/G-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1482821598,"Of the 9 histidines located in the catalytic domain of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase, three (His63, His106, and His298) were found to be conserved in the adenylate cyclase of Bacillus anthracis, another calmodulin-dependent enzyme. Substitution of His63 with Arg, Glu, Gln, or Val decreased the catalytic efficiency of adenylate cyclase between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude and altered the kinetic properties of the enzyme. These effects varied in relation to the nature of the substituting residue, pH, and direction of the reaction, i.e. ATP cyclization (forward) or ATP synthesis (reverse). Arg was the best substituent for His63 as catalyst in the forward reaction, with shift of the optimum pH to the alkaline side, whereas Glu was the best substituent for His63 in the reverse reaction, with shift of the optimum pH to the acidic side. Diethyl pyrocarbonate, which had a deleterious effect on wild-type adenylate cyclase was ineffective on His63 mutants. From these results we conclude that His63 is involved in the reaction mechanism of adenylate cyclase, which requires a general acid/base catalyst, most probably as an intermediate in a charge-relay system."
https://openalex.org/W2138177962,"A partial characterization of the enzymatic hydrolysis of 11-cis- and all-trans-retinyl palmitate by bovine retinal pigment epithelium microsomes was carried out using a micro-radiometric method to quantitate liberated palmitic acid. Retinyl ester hydrolase (REH) activity was examined in the absence of detergent. Hydrolysis of 11-cis- and all-trans-retinyl palmitate was protein- and time-dependent. Optimal enzyme activity occurred at slightly alkaline pH (8-9). Apparent kinetic constants (Vmax and Km) for the 11-cis-REH were 2.1 nmol/min/mg protein and 66 microM, respectively. All-trans-REH demonstrated a lower maximum velocity of 0.3 nmol/min/mg protein and a slightly higher substrate affinity of 27 microM. Further characterization of 11-cis-retinyl palmitate hydrolysis involved monitoring formation of reaction products, 11-cis retinol and palmitic acid, which were found to be released in essentially a 1:1 stoichiometry. Addition of all-trans retinyl bromoacetate, a known inhibitor of lecithin:retinol acyltransferase reduced both 11-cis and all-trans-REH activities but to significantly different degrees (50 and 76%, respectively). Although the microsomal preparation exhibited LRAT activity, acyl transfer was not readily reversible as labeled palmitic acid was not transferred to added acyl acceptor compounds. These findings suggest that hydrolysis of 11-cis-retinyl palmitate by bovine retinal pigment epithelium microsomes may occur at a catalytic site distinct from that for the all-trans isomer and that this hydrolysis is not representative of a reverse transesterification reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1568345243,"Type IX collagen from chick embryonic cartilage is a proteoglycan bearing a single chondroitin sulfate chain covalently linked to the alpha 2(IX) polypeptide chain. We have isolated type IX collagen metabolically labeled with [3H]proline using an antibody to type IX collagen and have found that the molecule is synthesized in two forms, a collagen form (COLIX) and a proteoglycan form (PGIX). In cultured chondrocytes, the two forms of type IX collagen showed a different ability to be deposited in the matrix. We have suggested the possibility that both forms may arise from an alternative substitution of a chondroitin sulfate chain to the NC3 domain of the alpha 2(IX) chain. Based on the reported amino acid sequence at the NC3 domain of alpha 2(IX), we have synthesized undecapeptides containing the sequence around the glycosaminoglycan attachment site of the alpha 2(IX) chain. Antibody against the peptide, which was raised in rabbit, only recognized COLIX and made it possible to distinguish COLIX from PGIX. Evidence shows that this could be due to a difference in antigenicity of the NC3 domain of the alpha 2(IX) chain between COLIX and PGIX caused by the substitution of a chondroitin sulfate chain to the serine residue in this domain. Therefore, this antibody may be useful as a probe for studies on the functions of glycosaminoglycan substitution in type IX collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1479996696,"FP21 is a 21-kDa fucoprotein which fractionates with the cytosol after high-speed centrifugation of gently lysed Dictyostelium cells. Less than 0.7% of FP21 is associated with vesicles. In proliferating cells, 4 x 10(5) fucosyl moieties/cell are associated with FP21 as anionic, possibly O-linked oligosaccharides equal in size to 4.8 glucose units. FP21 is underfucosylated in a mutant strain (HL250) that depends on extracellular fucose for synthesis of GDP-fucose. To determine the cellular site of FP21 fucosylation, cytosolic and vesicular preparations from strain HL250 were compared for their ability to transfer fucose from GDP-fucose to FP21. Cytosolic preparations fucosylate endogenous FP21 in a time-, concentration-, and divalent cation-dependent fashion, with a Km for GDP-fucose of 1.4 microM. Activity in normal cell cytosol is dependent on exogenous mutant FP21, demonstrating that FP21 is normally fully fucosylated. Both mutant and normal cytosols are also able to alpha-fucosylate a type 1 glycolipid substrate (8-methoxycarbonyloctyl-Gal beta 1-3 beta GlcNAc), but not related substrates, with Km values for the type 1 glycolipid of 0.99 mM and for GDP-fucose of 1.6 microM. Competitive inhibition between FP21 and the type 1 glycolipid shows that the same enzyme fucosylates both substrates. Intact and permeabilized vesicle preparations from wild-type cells are unable to fucosylate FP21 or the type 1 glycolipid by a divalent cation-dependent mechanism, and thus are devoid of FP21-fucosyltransferase. Since control experiments showed that vesicle leakage is minimal during cytosol preparation, these results indicate that FP21 is synthesized and fucosylated in the cytosolic compartment, by an unusual soluble fucosyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1579020547,"The accumulation of the interchangeable electron transfer catalysts plastocyanin and cytochrome c6 (cyt c6) in Scenedesmus obliquus is reciprocally regulated by the amount of copper ions in the medium. In copper-deficient cells, plastocyanin levels are severely reduced, whereas cyt c6 levels are high. Western blot analysis indicates that neither pre-apoplastocyanin nor apoplastocyanin accumulate to significant extents in copper-deficient Scenedesmus cells, and time course studies indicate that upon provision of copper salts to copper-deficient cells, the accumulation of plastocyanin to the levels maintained in copper-sufficient cells takes about 12-24 h. By 1) Northern hybridization analysis of Scenedesmus obliquus mRNA and 2) in vitro translation of polyadenylylated mRNA followed by immunoprecipitation of a 19.2-kilodalton precursor to plastocyanin, we demonstrate that the regulation of plastocyanin synthesis by copper must occur primarily at the level of mRNA accumulation. These results suggest that copper-dependent stimulation of holoplastocyanin accumulation requires de novo synthesis of the pre-apoprotein and contradict the conclusion of Bohner, H., Bohme, H., and Boger, P. (1981) FEBS Lett. 131, 386-388 that high levels of apoplastocyanin and a precursor to plastocyanin accumulate in copper-deficient Scenedesmus cells. We note also that although metal ions other than copper (e.g. silver) insert into Scenedesmus obliquus plastocyanin in vitro, synthesis of holoplastocyanin in vivo is specific for copper versus silver or mercury as it is in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Finally, the very different electrophoretic mobility and immunoreactivity of apoplastocyanin compared with holoplastocyanin suggests rather significant differences in structure between the copper-protein and the metal-free protein."
https://openalex.org/W2137720713,"The arginine residue(s) necessary for tetrahydrofolate binding to sheep liver serine hydroxymethyltransferase were located by phenylglyoxal modification. The incorporation of [7-14C]phenylglyoxal indicated that 2 arginine residues were modified per subunit of the enzyme and the modification of these residues was prevented by tetrahydrofolate. In order to locate the sites of phenylglyoxal modification, the enzyme was reacted in the presence and absence of tetrahydrofolate using unlabeled and radioactive phenylglyoxal, respectively. The labeled phenylglyoxal-treated enzyme was digested with trypsin, and the radiolabeled peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography on reversed-phase columns. Sequencing the tryptic peptides indicated that Arg-269 and Arg-462 were the sites of phenylglyoxal modification. Neither a spectrally discernible 495-nm intermediate (characteristic of the native enzyme when substrates are added) nor its enhancement by the addition of tetrahydrofolate, was observed with the phenylglyoxal-modified enzyme. There was no enhancement of the rate of the exchange of the alpha-proton of glycine upon addition of tetrahydrofolate to the modified enzyme as was observed with the native enzyme. These results demonstrate the requirement of specific arginine residues for the interaction of tetrahydrofolate with sheep liver serine hydroxymethyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W2142272865,"Prior studies have demonstrated that sphingomyelin synthesis is involved in adherence during macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells (Dressler, K. A., Kan, C.-C., and Kolesnick, R. N. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11522-11527). The present studies show that glycosphingolipid synthesis is also involved. Initial studies demonstrated that the potent phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulates a 6- and 12-fold increase in the levels of sialosyllactosylceramide (GM3) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer), respectively, during development of an adherent macrophage population. In contrast, the level of lactosylceramide (LacCer) decreased to 20% of unstimulated controls. These effects were specific to adherent macrophages as nonadherent cells had minimal alteration in the glycosphingolipid profile. D-Threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), a competitive inhibitor of UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.80), selectively blocked adherence during macrophage differentiation. PDMP markedly reduced basal levels of GlcCer, LacCer, and GM3 and prevented TPA-stimulated effects. PDMP (0.03-10 microM) reduced adherence after TPA from 30 to 6% of the total population. PDMP did not block other aspects of phorbol ester-induced macrophage differentiation including growth inhibition, expression of mRNA transcripts for the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc, development of the specific enzyme markers alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase and acid phosphatase, and the gross morphologic changes associated with macrophage differentiation. PDMP appeared to have no short term or prolonged toxic effect on HL-60 cells. These studies show that PDMP selectively blocked adherence of HL-60 cells during phorbol ester-induced macrophage differentiation and suggest that this compound may be useful in the description of the biologic roles of glycosphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1497489540,"Abstract Treatment of quiescent Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts with bombesin resulted in a rapid 6-8-fold stimulation of cytosolic Ser/Thr kinase activities toward the S6 peptide (RRLSSLR), myelin basic protein (MBP), and the G peptide (SPQPSRRGSESSEE). Anion exchange Mono Q chromatography resolved multiple S6 peptide- and G peptide kinase activities and two MBP kinase peaks. Both MBP- and several S6 peptide kinase peaks could be inactivated by PCSL (PP2A2) phosphatase action. This indicates that the bombesin-induced activation of these enzymes is mediated by a Ser/Thr phosphorylation event. The S6 peptide kinases as well as the two MBP kinases stimulated in response to bombesin are similar to those activated by epidermal growth factor in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts which suggests that the early events of the signal transduction pathway mediated by these growth factors in Swiss 3T3 cells may converge in the activation of common Ser/Thr kinases. Bombesin, which acts as a sole mitogen for Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, also produced a several-fold increase in the kinase activity toward the RRREEESEEE peptide, a specific substrate for CK-2. This kinase activity was heparin-sensitive and also measurable with the G peptide (SPQPSRRGSESSEE) and GS-1 peptide (YRRAAVPPSPSPSLSRHSSPHQSEDEE), which contain consensus sequences for phosphorylation by CK-2. The bombesin-stimulated CK-2 activity could not be measured in whole cytosols but was revealed by the anion exchange chromatography step. The activation of CK-2 was not reversed by PCSL phosphatase action. The implication of CK-2 in the signal transduction pathway of bombesin is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1546663033,"This study establishes that guinea pig liver cytosolic beta-glucosidase generates a common glucosyl-enzyme intermediate from a variety of aryl beta-D-glucoside substrates and that the intermediate can react with various acceptors to form distinct products at rates which are dependent on the structure, nucleophilicity, and concentration of the acceptor. Specifically, we demonstrate that water and linear alkanols will react with the glucosyl-enzyme intermediate to form D-glucose and alkyl-beta-D-glucoside (e.g. octyl-beta-D-glucoside), respectively. The rate of alcoholysis is 24-fold greater than the rate of hydrolysis of the glucosyl-enzyme intermediate and accounts for the increase in steady-state rate of substrate disappearance in the presence of alcohols. In addition, the substrate molecule itself (e.g. p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside (pNP-Gal)) can serve as an acceptor in the transglycosylation reaction, thereby enabling the enzyme to synthesize disaccharide glycosides (e.g. pNP-beta-Gal(6----1)beta-Gal). The transglycosylation data point to the presence of two hydrophobic subsites in the active site of the cytosolic beta-glucosidase. These data support a model in which the cytosolic beta-glucosidase binds an acceptor and a glycosyl donor simultaneously within its catalytic center and efficiently catalyzes the transfer of a sugar residue from the donor to the acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1519001611,"The functional molecular mass of the cholate, phallotoxin, iodipamide, and ouabain transport proteins in isolated basolateral plasma membrane vesicles was determined by radiation inactivation.

After each dose, the initial uptake, the equilibrium binding, and the binding of the substrates at 4 degrees C were checked. The size of the transporting function was, for cholate, 107 +/- 8.9 kDa; for phallotoxin, 104 +/- 7 kDa; and for ouabain, 120 +/- 4.7 kDa. The target size for the binding proteins was 56 +/- 4.2, 57 +/- 5, and 47.2 +/- 1.95 kDa for cholate, phallotoxin, and taurocholate, respectively. In the case of iodipamide, the functional molecular mass for both the transport and binding proteins was 54 +/- 4.8 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1542047278,"We report here the identification on rat liver plasma membranes and microsomes of proteins that bind pancreatic polypeptide (PP) with high affinity and specificity (plasma membranes: KD = 4.6 nM, Bmax = 3.28 pmol/mg protein; microsomes: KD = 3.45 nM, Bmax = 18.7 pmol/mg protein). These binding proteins appeared coupled to a G-protein, since 0.1 mM guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) decreased the affinity by half. When 125I-labeled PP-binding protein complexes covalently cross-linked with disuccinimido suberate were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two radioactive bands with M(r) values of 52,000 and 38,000 were demonstrated. Both bands were inhibited by unlabeled PP with an IC50 of approximately 5 nM (but not by neuropeptide Y or peptide YY). After the cross-linked complexes were solubilized from liver microsomes with 0.2% Triton X-100 and gel-filtered, they did not interact with the lectins wheat germ agglutinin, Ulex europaeus agglutinin, Ricinus communis agglutinin, and soy bean agglutinin. That these binding proteins may not be glycosylated was further supported by the failure of either peptide N-glycosidase F and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F to alter the size of the PP-binding protein complexes on gel electrophoresis. These PP-binding proteins may serve as receptors and mediate a hepatic effect of PP."
https://openalex.org/W1546894234,"Creation of the mature 5' terminus of human 18 S rRNA in vitro occurs via a two-step processing reaction. In the first step, an endonucleolytic activity found in HeLa cell nucleolar extract cleaves an rRNA precursor spanning the external transcribed spacer-18 S boundary at a position 3 bases upstream from the mature 18 S terminus leaving 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, 5' hydroxyl termini. In the second step, a nucleolytic activity(s) found in HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract removes the 3 extra bases and creates the authentic 5'-phosphorylated terminus of 18 S rRNA. Here we have examined the sequence requirements for the trimming reaction. The trimming activity(s), in addition to requiring a 5' hydroxyl terminus, prefers the naturally occurring adenosine as the 5'-terminal base. By a combination of deletion, site-directed mutagenesis, and chemical modification interference approaches we have also identified a region of 18 S rRNA spanning bases +6 to +25 (with respect to the mature 5' end) which comprises a critical recognition sequence for the trimming activity(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1522668923,"Abstract Although cytosolic Ca2+ transients are known to influence the magnitude and duration of hormone and neurotransmitter release, the processes regulating the decay of such transients after cell stimulation are not well understood. Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ efflux across the secretory vesicle membrane, following its incorporation into the plasma membrane, may play a significant role in Ca2+ efflux after stimulation of secretion. We have measured an enhanced 45Ca2+ efflux from cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells following cell stimulation with depolarizing medium (75 mM K+) or nicotine (10 microM). Such stimulation also causes Ca2+ uptake via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and secretion of catecholamines. Na+ replacement with any of several substitutes (N-methyl-glucamine, Li+, choline, or sucrose) during cell stimulation inhibited the enhanced 45Ca2+ efflux, indicating and Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ efflux process. Na+ deprivation did not inhibit 45Ca2+ uptake or catecholamine secretion evoked by elevated K+. Suppression of exocytotic incorporation of secretory vesicle membranes into the plasma membrane with hypertonic medium (620 mOsm) or by lowering temperature to 12 degrees C inhibited K(+)-stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux in Na(+)-containing medium but did not inhibit the stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake. Enhancement of exocytotic secretion with pertussis toxin resulted in an enhanced 45Ca2+ efflux without affecting calcium uptake. The combined results suggest that Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ efflux across secretory vesicle membranes, following their incorporation into the plasma membrane during exocytosis, plays a significant role in regulating calcium efflux and the decay of cytosolic Ca2+ in adrenal chromaffin cells and possibly in related secretory cells."
https://openalex.org/W1570438659,"The carbocyclic analogues of phosphoribosylamine, glycinamide ribonucleotide, and formylglycinamide ribonucleotide have been prepared enantiospecifically from D-ribonic acid gamma-lactone. These carbocycles, which have the same absolute configuration as the natural D-ribose-derived intermediates of de novo purine biosynthesis, are utilized stoichiometrically by the initial enzymes of the pathway. A comparison of the enzymatic processing of the (-)-enantiomers with those of the racemates indicates that in some cases, the (+)-enantiomer acts to inhibit the enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1509575328,"Recently, we described the properties of a mutant (H142N) of Escherichia coli succinyl coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase in which His-142 of the alpha-subunit was changed to Asn (Luo, G.-X., and Nishimura, J.S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20781-20785). The mutant enzyme was practically devoid of ability to catalyze the overall reaction but was able to catalyze half-reactions at significant rates. Thus, phosphorylation by ATP and dephosphorylation by ADP of the mutant enzyme occurred at rates that were at least 10 times greater than those with wild type enzyme, and dephosphorylation by succinate plus CoA (succinyl-CoA formation) proceeded with a Vmax of 10% that of wild type, with no change in Km for succinate and very little change in Km for CoA. In the present work, it has been shown that incubation of 32P-labeled H142N with ATP caused a rapid depletion of label from the enzyme and incorporation of radioactivity into a nucleotide species that was neither ATP nor ADP. This reaction was catalyzed at comparatively negligible rates by wild type enzyme. Analysis of the labeled product by high pressure liquid chromatography and 31P NMR revealed that it was adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate (AP4). Incubation of labeled H142N with the ATP analog beta,gamma-methylene adenosine triphosphate also gave a product that appeared to be the corresponding tetraphosphate. The reaction in which AP4 was formed was greatly stimulated by the addition of phosphoenolpyruvate plus pyruvate kinase and strongly inhibited by ADP and by CoA plus succinate. The results are consistent with binding of ATP to, and reaction with, phosphorylated succinyl-CoA synthetase to form AP4. In this reaction, it was determined that the Km for ATP and the turnover number of phosphorylated enzyme were 14.5 microM and 0.024 s-1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1591643354,"NMR spectroscopy showed fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase from rabbit muscle accepts as substrates, in lieu of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, the oxoaldehydes methylglyoxal and phenylglyoxal but not hydroxymethylglyoxal. The enzyme catalyzed an aldol condensation between the oxoaldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to form a monophosphorylated diketone and was inactivated in the process. Circumvention of this reaction, by metabolism of oxoaldehydes to hydroxy acids, may be a metabolic role for the glyoxalase enzyme system. Transketolase and transaldolase were found not to accept oxoaldehydes as substrates in place of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1585732567,"Nitrogenase contains approximately 38 iron ions/complete unit. Therefore, we sought to identify steps and genes involved in nitrogenase production that are responsive to iron availability. We have characterized nitrogenase production in Klebsiella pneumoniae grown in a range of different iron concentrations. We find significant accumulation (50-75%) and normal synthesis rates of the structural polypeptides, even under conditions in which the observed nitrogenase activities are only 14-28% of those observed in iron-sufficient conditions. Thus, maturation instead of synthesis of the structural polypeptides is primarily responsible for the iron dependence of nitrogenase activity. We have also used a binary plasmid system in Escherichia coli to investigate the contributions of various nitrogen fixation (nif) genes to the iron dependence of nitrogenase production. At least one of the nif genes DKTYENXUSVW can modulate synthesis of the structural polypeptide NIF H in response to iron availability. We speculate that an iron-deficient complex of the product(s) of at least one of these genes may repress structural polypeptide synthesis in iron-depleted K. pneumoniae. Such a system would compensate for the inactivity of NIF L in iron-depleted cultures and ensure balanced production of the structural polypeptides of nitrogenase in accordance with the iron available for their maturation."
