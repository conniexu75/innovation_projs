https://openalex.org/W1544954412,"Persistent stimulation of the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) engenders, within minutes, diminished responsiveness of the β1AR/adenylyl cyclase signal transduction system. This desensitization remains incompletely defined mechanistically, however. We therefore tested the hypothesis that agonist-induced desensitization of the β1AR (like that of the related β2AR) involves phosphorylation of the receptor itself, by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK1) or other G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). Both Chinese hamster fibroblast and 293 cells demonstrate receptor-specific desensitization of the β1AR within 3-5 min. Both cell types also express βARK1 and the associated inhibitory proteins β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2, as assessed by immunoblotting. Agonist-induced β1AR desensitization in 293 cells correlates with a 2 ± 0.3-fold increase in phosphorylation of the β1AR, determined by immunoprecipitation of the β1AR from cells metabolically labeled with 32Pi. This agonist-induced β1AR phosphorylation derives approximately equally from PKA and GRK activity, as judged by intact cell studies with kinase inhibitors or dominant negative βARK1 (K220R) mutant overexpression. Desensitization, likewise, is reduced by only ~50% when PKA is inhibited in the intact cells. Overexpression of rhodopsin kinase, βARK1, βARK2, or GRK5 significantly increases agonist-induced β1AR phosphorylation and concomitantly decreases agonist-stimulated cellular cAMP production (p < 0.05). Furthermore, purified βARK1, βARK2, and GRK5 all demonstrate agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the β1AR. Consistent with a GRK mechanism, receptor-specific desensitization of the β1AR was enhanced by overexpression of β-arrestin-1 and −2 in transfected 293 cells. We conclude that rapid agonist-induced desensitization of the β1AR involves phosphorylation of the receptor by both PKA and at least βARK1 in intact cells. Like the β2AR, the β1AR appears to bind either β-arrestin-1 or β-arrestin-2 and to react with rhodopsin kinase, βARK1, βARK2, and GRK5. Persistent stimulation of the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) engenders, within minutes, diminished responsiveness of the β1AR/adenylyl cyclase signal transduction system. This desensitization remains incompletely defined mechanistically, however. We therefore tested the hypothesis that agonist-induced desensitization of the β1AR (like that of the related β2AR) involves phosphorylation of the receptor itself, by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK1) or other G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs).

Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 60: 405-430Google Scholar), lipolysis by adipose tissue(2Arner P. Kriegholm E. Engfeldt P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 259: 317-322Google Scholar), and blood pressure homeostasis(3Kopp U. DiBona G. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F418-F424Google Scholar), among other vital functions. Like many Gs-coupled receptors (4Lohse M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Google Scholar), the β1AR demonstrates receptor-specific or homologous desensitization(2Arner P. Kriegholm E. Engfeldt P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 259: 317-322Google Scholar, 5Zhou X.M. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7462-7468Google Scholar); persistent or repetitive stimulation decreases the receptor's ability to activate adenylyl cyclase. In contrast to desensitization of the β2AR, however, little is known about desensitization of the β1AR at the molecular level. β1-adrenergic receptor cAMPdependent protein kinase β-adrenergic receptor kinase guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein G protein-coupled receptor kinase stimulatory G protein (-)-isoproterenol Chinese hamster fibroblast human embryonic kidney cells 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfon-amide•2HCl phosphate-buffered saline. Because it shares physiologic agonists, G protein coupling, and a 54% amino acid homology with the β2AR(6Frielle T. Collins S. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Google Scholar), the β1AR might be expected to share regulatory mechanisms with the β2AR as well. Occurring within seconds to minutes of agonist exposure, short term desensitization of the β2AR/Gs/adenylyl cyclase system involves phosphorylation of the receptor by two classes of serine/threonine kinases (for review, see (4Lohse M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Google Scholar)). The second messenger-dependent kinases PKA and protein kinase C phosphorylate and desensitize the β2AR, but because they phosphorylate multiple proteins, they mediate a generalized cellular hyporesponsiveness known as heterologous desensitization(4Lohse M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Google Scholar). Second messenger-independent G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs)(7Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Google Scholar), by contrast, initiate a two-step process of homologous desensitization by phosphorylating only activated receptors. Once phosphorylated, the receptors bind to inhibitory proteins, the β-arrestin isoforms(8Lohse M.J. Andexinger S. Pitcher J. Trukawinski S. Codina J. Faure J.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8558-8564Google Scholar, 9Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Google Scholar), which uncouple the receptors from Gs. Like the β2AR, the β1AR possesses both a canonical site for PKA phosphorylation in the carboxyl-terminal portion of its third intracellular loop and a serine/threonine-rich cytoplasmic tail (6Frielle T. Collins S. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Google Scholar), the region of the β2AR phosphorylated by GRKs(4Lohse M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Google Scholar, 10Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Google Scholar). That the β1AR may be desensitized by a GRK-initiated mechanism is suggested by the examination of myocardium from failing human hearts. In the lethal condition of human chronic heart failure, depressed β-adrenergic responsiveness accompanies a 2-3-fold up-regulation in the expression of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK1 or GRK2)(11Ungerer M. Bohm M. Elce J.S. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circulation. 1993; 87: 454-463Google Scholar). Despite this provocative association, however, the only mechanistic investigation of short term β1AR desensitization published thus far suggests that only a PKA-dependent mechanism, and not a GRK-dependent mechanism, effects β1AR desensitization(5Zhou X.M. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7462-7468Google Scholar). We therefore utilized a combination of in vitro reconstitution and intact cell model systems to assess directly the role of GRKs and β-arrestin isoforms in both the agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the β1AR. All cell culture reagents were procured from Life Technologies. Human embryonal kidney (293) cells and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. H-89 was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Nonidet P-40 and okadaic acid were obtained from Calbiochem, and staurosporine was from Boehringer Mannheim. Ascites containing the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was obtained from Berkeley Antibody Co. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), forskolin, (-)-isoproterenol bitartrate, and the β1AR/β2AR antagonists nadolol and (-)-alprenolol were obtained from Sigma. The β2AR antagonist ICI-118,551•HCl and dopamine•HCl were procured from Research Biochemicals International. [32P]Orthophosphate (carrier-free), [125I]iodocyanopindolol, [2,8-3H]adenine, [α-32P]ATP, [γ-32P]ATP, [3H]cAMP, L-[35S]methionine/L-[35S]cyteine (EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix), and [8-14C]cAMP came from DuPont NEN. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega. Recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out by standard techniques(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The influenza hemagglutinin nonapeptide epitope (YPYDVPDYA) for the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (13Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Google Scholar) was added to the amino terminus of the human β1AR cDNA (6Frielle T. Collins S. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Google Scholar) with the polymerase chain reaction. The 5′ (sense strand) primer was 5′-CGCGGGGGATCCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCCGGCGCGGGGGTGCTCGTCCTG-3′, with the start codon and nucleotides 4-24 of the native sequence underlined; the 3′ (template strand) primer was 5′-GGTCGGCGCTGGCCAGGGAC-3′ (nucleotides 399-380). The resultant polymerase chain reaction-generated 438-base pair fragment and the expression vector pcDNA I (Invitrogen) were cut with BamHI and PstI and ligated to generate the construct pcDNA I/12β15′. A 1.2-kilobase pair β1AR cDNA fragment produced by digestion with Bgl2 (Klenow-blunted) and PstI was then subcloned into pcDNA I/12β15′, which had been prepared by digestion with XhoI (Klenow-blunted) and PstI. The resulting construct was designated 12β1AR. A SacI (T4 polymerase-blunted)/BglII fragment of the human β1AR cDNA was subcloned into the baculovirus shuttle vector pVL1393 (Invitrogen) to create pBacβ1. After digestion with NcoI and SalI, the 12CA5 epitope-tagged β3AR cDNA (14Liggett S.B. Freedman N.J. Schwinn D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3665-3669Google Scholar) was Klenow-blunted and subcloned into pcDNA I to create “12β3AR.” The cDNAs for bovine βARK1(15Benovic J.L. DeBlasi A. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1989; 246: 235-240Google Scholar), bovine βARK2(16Benovic J.L. Onorato J.J. Arriza J.L. Stone W.C. Lohse M. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14939-14946Google Scholar), and bovine rhodopsin kinase (17Lorenz W. Inglese J. Palczewski K. Onorato J. Caron M. Lefkowitz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8715-8719Google Scholar) were subcloned into pcDNA I using HindIII, EcoRI/NdeI (Klenow-blunted), and HindIII/BamHI sites, respectively. The bovine GRK5 construct in pcDNA I (10Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Google Scholar) and the human D1A-dopamine receptor cDNA in pCMV5 (18Dearry A. Gingrich J. Falardeau P. Fremeau R.J. Bates M. Caron M. Nature. 1990; 347: 72-76Google Scholar) have been described previously. Rat β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 (9Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Google Scholar) were subcloned into pcDNA I by blunting with T4 polymerase after digesting with SacII/SalI and KpnI/SalI, respectively. To create the K220R mutant of bovine βARK1, we amplified a 327-base pair AccI fragment with the the following 5′ (sense strand) primer: 5′-CGCGGGGTCTACGGCTGCCGGAAGGCCGACACGGGCAAGATGTACGCCATGAGGTGTCTGGAC-3′ (the mutagenic codon is underlined). Cut with AccI, this fragment and the (dephosphorylated) βARK1/pBC12BI construct (15Benovic J.L. DeBlasi A. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1989; 246: 235-240Google Scholar) were ligated. The βARK1 K220R cDNA was then subcloned into pcDNA I, as above. Dideoxy sequencing was used to confirm the specificity of mutagenesis in all polymerase chain reaction-derived fragments. All recombinant baculovirus operations were conducted according to standard protocols(19O'Reilly D. Miller L. Luckow V. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were co-transfected in monolayer culture with pBacβ1 and BaculoGold® (PharMingen) DNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant recombinant baculovirus (Acβ1AR) was plaque-purified and used to infect log-phase cultures of Sf9 cells in 100-ml spinner flasks with a multiplicity of infection about 0.5. Forty-eight hours into infection, the Sf9 cells expressed ~5 pmol of β1AR/mg of cell protein. Chinese hamster fibroblast (CHW) cells were grown in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin (medium A), as described previously(20Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with either the human β2AR (20Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Google Scholar) or the human β1AR (6Frielle T. Collins S. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Google Scholar) cDNAs in the expression vector pBC12BI (20Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Google Scholar), and stably transfected clones were selected as described previously(20Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Google Scholar). Cells used for these experiments expressed either the β2AR or β1AR at ~300 fmol/mg of membrane protein. 293 cells were incubated at 37°C in 95% air, 5% CO2 and grown in medium B (90% minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin). The evening before transfection, 4 × 106 cells were plated per 90-mm dish. These cells were transfected on day 1 by calcium phosphate co-precipitation(21Didsbury J. Uhing R. Tomhave E. Gerard C. Gerard N. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11564-11568Google Scholar). Each plate received 10 μg of DNA total, comprising 0.25 μg of 12β1AR along with either a 4-fold molar excess of D1A-dopamine receptor plasmid, a 7-fold molar excess of GRK plasmid, a 10-fold molar excess of β-arrestin plasmid, a 16-fold molar excess of βARK1 K220R plasmid, or a 3-fold molar excess of both βARK1 and β-arrestin-2 plasmids; the balance of DNA comprised the empty vector pcDNA I. For 12β3AR experiments, each plate received 10-15 μg of DNA comprising 5-10 μg of 12β3AR and 2.5-5 μg of either βARK1 or β-arrestin-2 plasmids, with the balance comprising just pcDNA I. Cells were split on day 2 into assay dishes as follows: for phosphorylation assays, 1 × 106 cells/9.6 cm2 well of six-well dishes; for cAMP accumulation assays, 2 × 105cells/3.8 cm2 well of 12-well dishes. Assays were performed on day 4. β1AR expression ranged from 0.8 to 2.5 pmol/mg of cell protein (see below); within a single experiment, however, β1AR expression among various co-transfected cell types varied from control cells by <30%, except where noted in the legend of Fig. 8. CHW cells at 90% confluence were incubated for 2 h in medium A without serum, and then exposed at 37°C to this medium containing 100 μM ascorbate with (desensitized cells) or without (control cells) 1 μM(-)-isoproterenol (ISO) for the indicated times. Cell dishes were then transferred to ice and washed 4 times with 20 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were next scraped into 5 mM Tris•Cl, pH 7.4 (25°C), 2 mM EDTA, and membranes were prepared as described previously(20Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity of membrane preparations from control and desensitized cells was assayed, and data analysis was conducted as described previously (20Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Google Scholar). To assay the accumulation of cAMP in intact cells, transiently transfected 293 cells in 12-well dishes were labeled by incubation in 0.5 ml/well of 30% medium B, 70% minimal essential medium with 2 μCi of [3H]adenine/ml overnight or 4 μCi of [3H]adenine/ml for 3 h. Assays were performed at 37°C in room air, in medium C (1 mM IBMX, 100 nM β2AR antagonist ICI-118,551 in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts). Paired 12-well dishes (ISO-pretreated and control) were handled together, and each comprised four sets of triplicate wells. Labeling medium was aspirated, and cells were exposed to medium C (0.5 ml/well) with or without 10 μM ISO or 2 mM dibutyryl cAMP for the indicated times (exposure 1). Afterward, media were aspirated, and the cells were washed with 1 ml/well of medium C. Cells were then challenged (or rechallenged) with 0.5 ml/well medium C with or without 10 μM ISO, 10 μM dopamine, or 50 μM forskolin for 4 min (exposure 2). Subsequently, dishes were transferred to ice, and cells were lysed by the addition of 0.5 ml/well of 2 × stop solution (0.2 mM cAMP and 9 nCi/ml [14C]cAMP in 5% (w/v) perchloric acid). The cAMP accumulated in the cells and media was quantitated chromatographically by the method of Salomon (22Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 22-29Google Scholar) and expressed as the percent incorporation of 3H into cAMP (3H in cAMP per well/total uptake of 3H per well). [14C]cAMP counts were used to normalize results for column yield, which averaged ~50%. The intra-assay coefficient of variation on triplicate determinations was ≤10%. The cAMP produced in response to stimulation during exposure 2 (see above) was calculated as the cAMP accumulation in stimulated cells minus the cAMP accumulation in unstimulated cells from the same 12-well dish. Data were normalized to values obtained on the control dish of each pair (i.e. the dish treated with control medium during exposure 1). To assess ISO-stimulated cAMP accumulation in 293 cells co-transfected with the 12β1AR and either a GRK or a β-arrestin, each distinct co-transfected cell type was plated in a single row of triplicate wells in 12-well dishes. Cells were labeled as described above, but after aspiration of labeling medium and before stimulation, cells were washed with 1 ml/well of 37°C minimal essential medium. Subsequently, cells were treated with 0.5 ml/well of medium C for 7 min at 37°C and then challenged with an additional 0.5 ml/well of medium C with or without various concentrations of ISO or 100 μM forskolin for 6 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml/well of 2 × stop solution, and cAMP was assayed as described above. Pilot ISO concentration/response experiments with these conditions demonstrated the EC50 to be ~100 nM and the maximally effective concentration to be ≥1 μM ISO. β3AR experiments were conducted in a similar manner, except that endogenous 293 cell β2ARs were antagonized with 20 μM nadolol instead of 100 nM ICI-188,551. CHW cells were washed twice in PBS, and scraped into 0°C lysis buffer (10 mM Tris•Cl, pH 7.4 (25°C), 2 mM EDTA with the following protease inhibitors: 0.1 mM PMSF; 10 μg/ml benzamidine, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor; 5 μg/ml aprotinin; 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Following cell disruption (20Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Google Scholar), the supernatant fraction taken after a 15-min, 100,000 × g spin was designated as the cytosolic fraction. Whole cell extracts of 293 cells were prepared in a similar fashion, without centrifugation. Immunoblotting was performed with previously characterized antisera(9Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C.

Lefkowitz R.J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4045-4055Google Scholar), essentially as described previously (9Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Google Scholar) except that chemiluminescent detection of immune complexes was performed with ECL reagents and Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham Corp.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. -Fold overexpression of proteins in transfected cells was quantitated by end point dilution of transfected cell homogenates. Assays were performed at 37°C, in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, with antibiotics as above (medium D). Cells were washed with 2 ml of medium D/well. Labeling was then conducted for 40 min in a CO2 incubator with 0.5 ml of medium D/well containing 100 μCi of 32Pi/ml. In PKA inhibition experiments, this labeling medium contained 0.04% dimethyl sulfoxide with or without 20 μM H-89. Next, to each well was added 0.5 ml of medium D containing vehicle with or without the indicated stimulating compound, and incubation continued for 3 min (with ISO) or 10 min (with forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, and TPA). In βARK1 K220R experiments, 0.25 ml of medium D containing 3 μM okadaic acid (1 μM final concentration) was added to labeled cells immediately before forskolin or TPA stimulation (and 7 min before ISO stimulation) to inhibit cellular phosphatases. In experiments designed to inhibit both PKA and protein kinase C, 0.5 ml of medium D containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide with or without 1 μM staurosporine was added to each well during the terminal 10 min of labeling. Stimulations were terminated by transferring dishes to ice, adding 2 ml of ice-cold PBS/well, washing once with PBS, and adding 0.5 ml/well of RIPA+ buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris•Cl, pH 8.0 (25°C), 5 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, with 10 mM NaF and 10 mM disodium pyrophosphate as phosphatase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors as above, in lysis buffer). Solubilized cells and debris were transferred to tubes in a total volume of 0.8 ml. After 1 h on ice, debris was separated from soluble material at 200,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C in a TLA 100.2 rotor (Beckman). From the supernatant fraction, 730 μl were transferred to 1.5-ml conical tubes. Two 15-μl aliquots were removed for protein assay (Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit). The remaining volume was processed for immunoprecipitation, each step of which was conducted at 0-4°C. Pre-clearing was effected by adding to each tube 100 μl of 10% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin/RIPA+ and rotating for 1 h. After the beads were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 15 s, the supernatant fluid was transferred to a new tube containing protein A beads (as above) and 12 μg of the monoclonal IgG 12CA5. After 2 h on an inversion wheel, beads were pelleted, and the supernatant fluid was removed. The beads were next washed 3 times with 1 ml of RIPA+ and aspirated to dryness with a 28-gauge needle. Subsequently, 60 μl of 1 × Laemmli sample buffer (24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) was added to each sample. Immune complexes were dissociated by heating to 65°C for 10 min and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gels. Gel lanes were loaded with the volume of sample buffer necessary to give equivalent amounts of β1AR from each sample, as follows. The β1AR density (pmol/mg of whole cell protein) of each transfected cell line was determined on a nonradioactive aliquot of each transfected cell population and was multiplied by the value for RIPA+-solubilized protein in each immunoprecipitation tube; the resultant receptors/tube values were then normalized and used to adust gel loading volumes. The gels were stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography on DuPont Reflection film with an intensifying screen at −80°C for 48-72 h. The same gels were analyzed quantitatively with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Identical rectangles were drawn about each receptor band, and the signal intensity within each rectangle was integrated. Specific radioactivity in the receptor bands was determined as the difference between radioactivity in the receptor rectangle and radioactivity in an identical rectangle drawn in lanes of untransfected parental cells. Automatic background subtraction was not used. Biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation (25Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 245-251Google Scholar) were employed to determine the stoichiometry of β1AR phosphorylation in intact 293 cells. Briefly, transfected cells were labeled in medium B containing dialyzed fetal bovine serum, with either L-[35S]methionine/L-[35S]cyteine (50 μCi/ml met) for 48 h or with 32Pi (0.5 mCi/ml) for 7 h. Cells were stimulated (or not) with 10 μM ISO, washed twice with PBS, and then processed for immunoprecipitation as above, except that fluorography was used to image the 35S-labeled proteins(24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Gel bands corresponding to the β1AR were cut, processed, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter as described previously(25Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 245-251Google Scholar). The total counts contained in the β1AR bands were corrected by subtracting nonspecific counts obtained from the cognate bands of gel lanes derived from untransfected cells. The specific activities of 35S-labeled proteins and cellular [32P]ATP were determined as described previously(25Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 245-251Google Scholar). Sf9 cell plasma membrane fragments were prepared as described previously (26Pei G. Tiberi M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3633-3636Google Scholar) from Acβ1AR-infected cells, yielding 50-80 pmol of β1AR/mg of protein. GRKs were purified as described previously (10Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Google Scholar, 16Benovic J.L. Onorato J.J. Arriza J.L. Stone W.C. Lohse M. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

A. 1994; 91: 3633-3636Google Scholar) from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses for βARK1, βARK2, and GRK5(10Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Google Scholar, 26Pei G. Tiberi M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3633-3636Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reactions were conducted at 30°C for 15 min, with ~1 pmol of β1AR in Sf9 membranes/tube, exactly as described in (26Pei G. Tiberi M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3633-3636Google Scholar). To determine the β1AR or β2AR expression, transfected 293 cell homogenates, Sf9 cells or membranes, or CHW cell membranes (20Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Google Scholar) were subjected to saturation binding with 0.7 nM [125I]iodocyanopindolol, as described previously(20Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Google Scholar). The protein concentration of cell homogenates was estimated by the method of Bradford(24Harlow E. Lane D.

The ionic strength-dependent folding of this oligonucleosome assembly was monitored by sedimentation velocity and electron microscopy. Both types of analysis indicate that under ionic conditions resembling those found in the physiological range and in the absence of histone H1, the acetylated oligonucleosome complexes remain in an extended conformation in contrast to their nonacetylated counterparts. The implications of this finding in the context of a multistate model of chromatin folding (Hansen, J. C., and Ausio, J.(1992) TIBS 197, 187-191) as well as its biological relevance are discussed.

The implications of this finding in the context of a multistate model of chromatin folding (Hansen, J. C., and Ausio, J.(1992) TIBS 197, 187-191) as well as its biological relevance are discussed. In our opinion, one of the important landmarks in the chromatin field during the last two decades has been the realization that histones are not merely passive structural players but have an important functional role in the modulation of genomic expression (2Grunstein M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 643-678Google Scholar, 3Grunstein M. TIG (Trends Genet.). 1990; 6: 395-400Google Scholar, 4Wolfe A.P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3354-3361Google Scholar). In other words, they have both a structural and a functional role. At the structural level, histones provide the protein blocks that allow for the hierarchical folding of DNA in nucleosomes, higher order, and chromosomal structures. At the highest level of compaction the structures arising from such organization (chromosomes) may be essential to prevent the shearing of long eukaryotic DNA molecules during the transmission of the genetic material from one cell to another in the course of cell division (5Cavalier-Smith T. Soc. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 32: 33-84Google Scholar, 6Cavalier-Smith T. BioEssays. 1988; 9: 72-78Google Scholar) in eukaryotes. At the lower levels, chromatin structure and nucleosomes may have also been selected during the evolutionary transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, as the scaffold that provides support and modulates the fine tuning of the more complex functional mechanisms of transcription and replication. All these levels of folding must be reversible in order to accommodate the different functional needs during the cell cycle. The dynamic aspects of this chromatin folding and its implications both at the structural and functional level are still poorly understood. During the cell cycle, histones undergo several chemical post-translational modifications that could presumably be involved in the modulation of chromatin folding. One of the more extensively characterized of such modifications has been histone acetylation. Histone acetylation is a dynamic post-translational metabolic modification (7Davie J.R. Hendzel M.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 98-195Google Scholar) that has been strongly correlated with transcriptional activity and with the processes of histone deposition (such as during replication) or histone displacement (such as during spermatogenesis) (for detailed reviews see (8Csordas A. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 23-38Google Scholar, 9Turner B.M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 13-20Google Scholar, 10Ausio J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 1-5Google Scholar, 11Turner B.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 5-8Google Scholar)). At the structural level, histone acetylation is a lysine amidation reaction catalyzed by acetyltransferases. By virtue of its chemical nature, it alters the net positive charge balance of the N-terminal regions (tails) of the core histones (histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), and as such, it has been long hypothesized to weaken the histone-DNA interactions involved at the different levels of chromatin folding. A disruption of the protein-DNA interactions would be expected to lead to the loss of stability (folding) of both the chromatin fiber and its constitutive subunits, the nucleosomes. Nevertheless, the experimental effort to provide support to this hypothesis has led in the past, quite often, to conflicting results. At its best it has provided evidence for only minor changes in chromatin folding. The structural effect of histone acetylation on the conformation of the nucleosome core particle (12Bauer W.R. Hayes J.J. White J.H. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 685-690Google Scholar) (consisting of a double set of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones and 146-base pair DNA) has been found to be small(12Bauer W.R. Hayes J.J. White J.H. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 685-690Google Scholar, 13Simpson R.T. Cell. 1978; 13: 691-699Google Scholar, 14Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Google Scholar, 15Imai B.S. Yau P. Baldwin J.P. Ibel K. May R.P. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8784-8792Google Scholar). A larger effect was observed in the case of nucleosomes consisting of longer DNA(16Bode J.H. Gomez-Lira M. Schrter H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 437-445Google Scholar). Very small charges were also reported at the higher order structure level of chromatin folding(17McGhee J.D. Nickol J.M. Felsenfeld G. Ran D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 4065-4075Google Scholar, 18Dimitrov S.I. Makarov V. Apostolova T. Pashev I. FEBS Lett. 1986; 197: 217-221Google Scholar). Despite all this, there is increasing evidence that the major effect of the histone tails (and hence acetylation) on chromatin folding (19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar) arises from their interactions with the linker DNA region connecting adjacent nucleosomes in the chromatin fiber. We have recently proposed a coupled multistate model of chromatin dynamics to account for the contribution of chromatin folding in the modulation of genetic activity (1Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 187-191Google Scholar). The results that follow, while providing experimental support for this model, also point to the importance of acetylation in the mechanisms of chromatin folding and dynamics. Chicken blood was obtained from commercial slaughterhouses in Victoria and processed immediately after collection. The 208-12 DNA template consisting of 12 tandem repeats of a 208-base pair fragment of the 5 S rRNA gene from the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus(25Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Robert Simpson. HeLa (S3 strain) cells were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection; Rockville, MD). Sephacryl S-1000 was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and Hydroxylapatite BioGel HTP was from Bio-Rad. HeLa cells (S3 strain) were grown in spinner culture at 37°C in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate as described elsewhere(14Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Google Scholar). Chicken erythrocyte histone octamers were obtained as described elsewhere(20Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Google Scholar). Control and highly hyperacetylated histone octamers from HeLa cells were prepared from chromatin fractions isolated as described previously(14Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Google Scholar). Only fraction a (14Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Google Scholar) was used as a source of hyperacetylated histones. The chromatin fractions (~6 mg) were then dialyzed against 0.633 M NaCl, 0.1 M potassium phosphate, 1 mM dithiothreitol (pH 6.7) with or without 5 mM sodium butyrate and loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (1.5 × 15 cm at a flow rate of 16 ml/8 fractions/h) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. After elution of the linker histones under these conditions (about 100 ml) the eluting buffer was changed to 1 M NaCl in the same buffer to elute the histone octamers. The histone octamers obtained in this way were concentrated in a centricon 10 and used immediately thereafter or kept frozen at −60°C. The 208-12 DNA template used in the oligonucleosome reconstitutions was prepared as described in (19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar). This procedure was carried out as described previously(19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar). SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli(21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Acetic acid, 8 M urea, 0.5% Triton X-100, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to (22Bonner W.M. West M.H.P. Stedman J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 17-23Google Scholar) with a few minor modifications. The acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio was 30:1 (separating gel) and 20:1 (stacking gel). The sample buffer was 10 M urea, 5% acetic acid, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.3% Pyronine Y. 1.2% agarose gels were prepared in TBE buffer (25 mM Tris borate, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), according to Maniatis et al.(23Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Preparation of the samples for electron microscopy was carried out according to Labhart and Koller (24Labhart P. Koller T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 24: 309-316Google Scholar) as described in (19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar). Micrographs were taken with a Philips 301 electron microscope. Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analysis were performed on a Beckman model E analytical ultracentrifuge with a computer-interfaced UV scanner (Ultrascan Interface and Data Analysis Program version 1.70; Borries Demeler (Missoula, MT). Experimental conditions and analysis of the runs were as described previously (19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar) or as indicated in the figure legends. We have characterized in the past (19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar, 20Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Google Scholar) the folding behavior of reconstituted oligonucleosome complexes using a DNA template consisting of 12 tandemly arranged copies of a 208-base pair fragment of 5 S rRNA gene from the sea urchin L. variegatus and chicken erythrocyte core histones. In the present work we have reconstituted 208-12 oligonucleosome complexes with the same DNA template but using highly acetylated core histones obtained from HeLa cells grown in the presence of sodium butyrate (to inhibit the cell deacetylases) and core histones obtained from HeLa cells grown in the absence of butyrate (used as a control). To this purpose, the chromatin from the butyrate-treated cells was fractionated based on its differential solubility in the presence of divalent cations to yield fractions highly enriched in highly hyperacetylated core histones(14Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Google Scholar). Upon depletion of histone H1 the core histones from both butyrate (acetylated) and non-butyrate (control) treated cells were purified under nondenaturing conditions using hydroxylapatite as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 shows the electrophoretic analysis of the core histones (panels A and B) as well as the DNA template and the resulting reconstituted oligonucleosome complexes (panel C). The acetylated histones used in this work (Fig. 1A, lanes 1) correspond to fraction a of the chromatin fractionation procedure (14Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Google Scholar) and contain an average of ~17 acetyl groups/histone octamer(14Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Google Scholar). The core histones obtained from non-butyrate-treated HeLa cells are shown in Fig. 1A, lanes 2, and in Fig. 1B, lane 2. Fig. 1 also shows a native agarose gel of the oligonucleosome complexes reconstituted with hyperacetylated histones (panel C, lane A) and histones of low level acetylation (Fig. 1C, lane N) in comparison with the 208-12 DNA used as a template (Fig. 1C, lane D). In agreement with previous observations(19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar, 25Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Google Scholar), the electrophoretic mobility of the 208-12 oligonucleosome complexes reconstituted with nonacetylated core histones is very similar to that of their 208-12 DNA template. Under the electrophoretic conditions used here (see “Experimental Procedures”) the acetylated oligonucleosome 12-mers also exhibit an almost identical mobility (Fig. 1C, lane A). Sedimentation equilibrium analysis carried out with both samples (see also Fig. 2) provided linear plots of log (absorbance) versus the square of the radial distance for the concentration gradient at equilibrium. The molecular weight established from these plots Mr= 2.92 × 106 (nonacetylated oligonucleosome complexes) and Mr = 2.93 × 106 (acetylated oligonucleosome complexes) is fully consistent with the presence of 12 nucleosomes/molecule of DNA template(19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar). The salt-dependent hydrodynamic behavior of the control and hyperacetylated oligonucleosome complexes is shown in Fig. 3 in comparison with the hydrodynamic data obtained from oligonucleosomes reconstituted with chicken erythrocyte histones. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, both the HeLa control oligonucleosomes (reconstituted with histones from non-butyrate-treated HeLa cells) and the oligonucleosomes reconstituted with chicken erythrocyte histones behave very similarly. As has already been exhaustively discussed(19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar), this dependence of the sedimentation coefficient within this ionic strength range (0-100 mM NaCl) corresponds to a folding pattern of the oligonucleosome structure such as that shown in Fig. 5B. Unfortunately, our results do not allow us to establish whether this folding is due to the bending of the internucleosomal DNA linker regions(26Yao J. Lowary P.T. Widom J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7603-7607Google Scholar), to an additional wrapping of these DNA regions about the histone octamer, or to a combination of both effects. However, it is obvious that the increase in the salt within the 0-100 mM range provides charge screening of the phosphates in the DNA backbone that allows for adjacent nucleosomes to come together. In contrast, oligonucleosomes reconstituted with histones from butyrate-treated HeLa cells exhibit a completely different behavior. At low salt (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 3 mM sodium butyrate, pH 7.5) the sedimentation coefficient of these complexes (~22 S) is much lower than that of the control counterparts (~27 S) for HeLa histone oligonucleosomes or 29 S for chicken erythrocyte-histone oligonucleosomes). Simple modeling calculations using the Kirkwood formalism (27Kirkwood J.G. J. Polymer Sci. 1954; 12: 1-14Google Scholar) (see also (19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar) for a detailed analysis) suggest that such a decrease in S value can be accounted for by an unfolding of the oligonucleosome fiber as a result of a partial unraveling of the nucleosomal DNA coil at the flanking sides of the acetylated nucleosome particle. The model is fully consistent with earlier data on the melting properties of hyperacetylated nucleosome core particles(14Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Google Scholar, 28Bode J. Henco K. Wingender E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 143-152Google Scholar). It was shown that hyperacetylated nucleosome core particles exhibited a significant increase in the first melting transitions (14Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Google Scholar) corresponding to the DNA regions at the ends of the DNA supercoil(29Weischet W.O. Tatchell K. van Holde K.E. Klump H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 139-160Google Scholar, 30Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10123-10127Google Scholar). Indeed, a release of the DNA affecting about 18.5 base pairs within these regions has been more recently proposed (31Norton V.G. Imai B.S. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 449-457Google Scholar). As the salt concentration increases, the sedimentation coefficient of the hyperacetylated oligonucleosome complexes also increases, reaching a plateau at about 100 mM NaCl with an s20 = 29 S (Fig. 3B). This value is very similar to the sedimentation coefficient of the control oligonucleosomes at low salt (see Fig. 3A), in which the linker DNA regions are in a rather extended conformation. These hydrodynamic data clearly indicate that under ionic strength conditions similar to those found under physiological conditions and in the absence of histone H1 acetylated oligonucleosome fibers retain an extended conformation. A similar change in conformation would also explain the slight shift observed in Fig. 3A for the curves corresponding to chicken erythrocyte oligonucleosomes and to hyperacetylated histone oligonucleosomes due to the differences in their basal levels of acetylation (0.6 acetyl residues/histone H4 for chicken erythrocytes and 1.2 acetyl residues/histone H4 in butyrate-untreated HeLa cells (32Oliva R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Locklear L. Dixon G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2739-2747Google Scholar)). Further experimental evidence in support of this comes from the electron microscopy analysis shown in Fig. 4. In contrast to what happens to nonacetylated oligonucleosome fibers(19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar), hyperacetylated oligonucleosomes remain in an unfolded conformation within the range of salt concentrations analyzed here. At low ionic strength (see Fig. 4, 0 mM) the fibers exhibit an extended conformation that is reminiscent of that exhibited by trypsinized oligonucleosomes (19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar) and agrees well with the hydrodynamic data. The results presented in the previous section conclusively show that histone acetylation has a positive role in the folding dynamics of the chromatin fiber. In the absence of linker histones under ionic strength conditions, similar to those of the physiological environment, acetylated polynucleosomal fibers remain in an extended conformation in contrast to their nonacetylated counterpart. These results suggest that, at the chromatin level, the major structural effect of the acetylation of the N-terminal regions of the histones is on the linker DNA connecting adjacent nucleosome particle. This is fully consistent with the finding that histone acetylation reduces the nucleosome core particle linking number change previously reported by Norton et al.(31Norton V.G. Imai B.S. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 449-457Google Scholar). It is also in good agreement with our earlier observation that the linker region is attacked more readily by micrococcal nuclease in hyperacetylated stripped chromatin(33Libertini L.J. Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Small E.W. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 477-487Google Scholar). Nevertheless, all these data are in apparent contradiction with the results recently obtained with SV40 minichromosomes from viral particles isolated from butyrate-treated cells(34Lutter C.L. Judis L. Paretti R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5004-5014Google Scholar). Although the histones of the SV40 minichromosomes exhibited a high extent of acetylation, no reduction in the level of constrained supercoiling could be detected(34Lutter C.L. Judis L. Paretti R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5004-5014Google Scholar). In an attempt to explain these experimental discrepancies it has been argued (34Lutter C.L. Judis L. Paretti R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5004-5014Google Scholar) that whereas in the in vivo systems histone acetylation occurs in nucleosomes that are already assembled, in the in vitro oligonucleosome systems used by Norton et al.(31Norton V.G. Imai B.S. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 449-457Google Scholar) oligonucleosomes were assembled (reconstituted) from histones that were already acetylated. However, this explanation seems very unlikely for the following reasons. 1) Our previously reported enhanced nuclease accessibility of the linker regions (33Libertini L.J. Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Small E.W. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 477-487Google Scholar) was observed in a native (nonreconstituted) chromatin. 2) As will be discussed next, some of the structural effects of histone acetylation on chromatin folding can be mimicked “in vitro” (to a certain extent) by histone trypsinization (removal of the histone N-terminal domains by trypsin). It was shown, in this case, that the same structural effects can be observed regardless of whether in situ trypsinized oligonucleosomes or oligonucleosomes reconstituted from trypsinized core histones were used(19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar). 3) It was also shown that the reconstituted 208-12 oligonucleosome system has a folding behavior identical to that of “native” oligonucleosomes isolated from chicken erythrocyte chromatin(19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar). This also argues against any DNA sequence specificity as being responsible (34Lutter C.L. Judis L. Paretti R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5004-5014Google Scholar) for the results retained with the hyperacetylated oligonucleosome construct used by Norton et al.(31Norton V.G. Imai B.S. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 449-457Google Scholar) and which is very similar to that used in this paper. The predominant effect of histone acetylation on the linker DNA region also explains the larger conformation effect observed at the nucleosome level (16Bode J.H. Gomez-Lira M. Schrter H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 437-445Google Scholar, 35Bertrand E.M. Erard M. Gomez-Lira M. Bode J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 229: 395-398Google Scholar) when compared with the core particle(14Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Google Scholar). The results obtained here with the hyperacetylated oligonucleosome complexes together with our earlier studies with native and reconstituted trypsinized oligonucleosomes provide experimental support to the multistate model of chromatin folding (1Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 187-191Google Scholar) (see Fig. 5). Although the role of the core histone tails in chromatin folding, has been long recognized(36Allan J. Harborne N. Rau D.C. Gould H. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 285-297Google Scholar, 37Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1479-1482Google Scholar), these regions seem to play a much more important role in the dynamic modulation of this folding than was initially envisaged. In the absence of H1, the interactions of the core histone tails with the linker DNA regions provide the charge neutralization necessary to allow, under physiological conditions, the bending (or additional wrapping about the histone octamer) of this DNA region. This brings adjacent nucleosome particles together in a partially folded intermediate order state (IOS).1 1The abbreviations used are: IOSintermediate order stateHOShigher order structureLOSlow order structure. It is clear from all our studies that under ionic strength conditions similar to those found in the cell nucleus, chromatin depleted of linker histones does not exhibit an extended conformation unless the histones are hyperacetylated. For simplicity, we have represented this intermediate state of folding as one in which nucleosomes are arranged in a contacting bidimensional zigzag organization, which is consistent with simple hydrodynamic modeling calculation(19Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Google Scholar, 20Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Google Scholar). Nevertheless the possibility of more complex three-dimensional arrangements arising from some kind of helical folding cannot be excluded(38Leuba S.M. Yang G. Robert C. Salmori B. van Holde K.E. Zlanatova J. Bustamante C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11621-11625Google Scholar). intermediate order state higher order structure low order structure. This IOS structure is not easily amenable to transcription(39Hansen J.C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7977-7988Google Scholar). Transcription may be favored upon transition to LOS modulated by histone acetylation. In fact both transcription initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase III have been shown to be significantly inhibited by the LOS ⟶ IOS transition(39Hansen J.C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7977-7988Google Scholar). In the presence of linker histones the extent of compaction of the chromatin fiber increases dramatically giving rise to the higher order structure (HOS) organization. Early studies on the effect of histone acetylation on the HOS of the chromatin fiber showed an almost negligible effect(17McGhee J.D. Nickol J.M. Felsenfeld G. Ran D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 4065-4075Google Scholar, 18Dimitrov S.I. Makarov V. Apostolova T. Pashev I. FEBS Lett. 1986; 197: 217-221Google Scholar). Therefore, the biological relevance of our finding has to do with the still unsolved issue of the linker histone stoichiometry in transcriptionally active chromatin (40Zlanatova J. van Holde K.E. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895Google Scholar) (i.e. with whether or not the transcriptionally active domains are deficient or not in this particular kind of histone). Although the problem remains largely unsettled, there is increasing evidence in support of an altered interaction between histones of the linker family and acetylated nucleosomes(41Ridsdale A.J. Hendzel M.J. Delcuve P.G. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5150-5156Google Scholar, 42Perry C. Annunziato A.T. Exp. Cell. Res. 1991; 196: 337-345Google Scholar). Upon displacement of histone H1 from its native binding position and/or removal of histone H1 from the linker DNA region (by mechanisms yet not quite understood), the major role of histone acetylation could be that of maintaining the transcriptionally active chromatin fiber in a transitionally unfolded conformation. Such an unfolding would allow the RNA polymerase to move along the coding regions of the gene during transcriptional elongation. Consistent with this model are the experimental observations that core histone hyperacetylation co-maps with the whole DNase I-sensitive domain in the chicken β-globin gene(43Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Google Scholar). It has also been shown that transcriptionally active chromatin has a loosened linker folding(44Grigoryev S.A. Spirin K.S. Krasheniunikov I.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7397-7406Google Scholar). Recently, a positive structural role for histone acetylation that allows transcription factor access to nucleosomal DNA has been postulated(45Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Google Scholar); yet, the distribution of acetylated histone, which co-maps with the entire DNase I sensitivity of the chicken β-globin domain, argues against an exclusively “recognition” role of histone acetylation. A widespread distribution of histone acetylation may indeed play an important role in the elongation stage through the dynamic equilibrium mechanisms described above (see Fig. 5). Despite the early correlation between transcription and histone acetylation(46Allfrey V.G. Faulkner R.M. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 786-794Google Scholar, 47Pogo B.G.T. Allfrey V.G. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 805-812Google Scholar), the causative structural connection between both has remained elusive for many years. As the pieces of this complicated puzzle seem to start coming together, the results of the structural studies, such as those reported here, call for the imperative need to use hyperacetylated chromatin complexes in any of the in vitro studies designed to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the eukaryotic transcription of pol II genes (48Paranjape S.M. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 265-297Google Scholar). We are very grateful to Dr. R. T.

It represents a newly identified family of neuronal specific Ca2+-binding proteins that includes neurocalcin, hippocalcin, and guanylyl cyclase-activating protein. To investigate the function of Rv in photoreceptors, we identified proteins that bind immobilized Rv in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Rhodopsin kinase (RK), interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, and tubulin interact with Rv in the presence of Ca2+. The importance of the Rv/RK interaction was further characterized. RK, purified using immobilized Rv as an affinity matrix, catalyzed the light-dependent and Ca2+-independent incorporation of phosphates into rhodopsin when reconstituted with urea-stripped rod outer segment membranes. When only a small fraction (0.04%) of rhodopsin was photolyzed, as many as 700 phosphates were incorporated per photolyzed rhodopsin, a phenomenon known as “high gain” phosphorylation. When recoverin was added, the activity of RK became sensitive to free Ca2+, with EC50 = 3 μM. The N-terminal myristoyl residue of Rv enhances the inhibitory effect of Rv and introduces cooperativity to the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation. Rv neither interacts with other members of the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase family such as β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 nor inhibits β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 activity. The specific and Ca2+-dependent Rv/RK interaction is necessary for the inhibitory effect of Rv on rhodopsin phosphorylation and may play an important role in photoreceptor light adaptation.

The specific and Ca2+-dependent Rv/RK interaction is necessary for the inhibitory effect of Rv on rhodopsin phosphorylation and may play an important role in photoreceptor light adaptation. Photoactivation of rhodopsin stimulates cGMP hydrolysis within vertebrate photoreceptors (for review, see 28Lagnado L. Baylor D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 995-1022Google Scholar and 43Yarfitz S. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14329-14331Google Scholar). The resulting loss of intracellular cGMP slows the influx of Ca2+ through cGMP-dependent cation channels in the photoreceptor plasma membrane. Under these conditions, unabated Ca2+ efflux through Na+/K+,Ca2+ exchangers lowers the bulk concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ from 550 to 50 nM (13Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1-20Google Scholar). The light-induced lowering of intracellular free Ca2+ is a signal that promotes recovery from photoexcitation. The calcium signal is decoded by calcium-binding proteins that participate in several biochemical reactions. Low Ca2+ concentrations stimulate resynthesis of cGMP by the action of Ca2+-binding proteins that stimulate guanylyl cyclase (26Koch K.W. Stryer L. Nature. 1988; 334: 64-66Google Scholar; 11Gorczyca W.A. Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4014-4018Google Scholar; 10Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D. Olshevskaya E. Laura R. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1345-1352Google Scholar). Low Ca2+ concentrations also stimulate plasma membrane cation channel activity by relieving the inhibitory effect of Ca2+/calmodulin on cGMP-gated cation channels (15Hsu Y.T. Molday R.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 76-79Google Scholar). Finally, low Ca2+ concentrations facilitate phosphorylation and inactivation of photoactivated rhodopsin (19Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Google Scholar; 19Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Google Scholar). The effect of Ca2+ on rhodopsin phosphorylation is mediated by a protein referred to as sensitivity-modulating protein (S-modulin) 1The abbreviations used are: S-modulinsensitivity-modulating proteinRvrecoverinROSrod outer segment(s)RKrhodopsin kinaseMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIRBPinterphotoreceptor retinoid-binding proteinBr2-BAPTA5,5’-dibromo-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acidGCAPguanylyl cyclase-activating proteinVILIPvisinin-like proteinNA-Rvnonacylated recoverinC1420-Rvmyristoylated recoverin. or recoverin (Rv) (21Kawamura S.

Recoverin is a Ca2+-binding protein present only in vertebrate photoreceptors (39Ray S. Zozulya S. Niemi G.A. Flaherty K.M. Brolley D. Dizhoor A.M. McKay D.B. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

It represents a recently identified family of neuronal specific Ca2+-binding proteins that includes hippocalcin (25Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Saitoh S. Miura M. Noguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nature. 1991; 349: 420-423Google Scholar), visinin-like protein (VILIP) (29Lenz S.E. Henschel Y. Zopf D. Voss B. Gundelfinger E.D. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 133-140Google Scholar), frequenin (37Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Engelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 15-28Google Scholar), and guanylyl cyclase activating protein (GCAP) (11Gorczyca W.A. Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4014-4018Google Scholar). Rv was initially purified from bovine retinas, and it was thought to be a Ca2+-sensitive activator of guanylyl cyclase, but this function has not been confirmed (16Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ray S. Stryer L. Science. 1993; 260: 740Google Scholar). Rv was also recognized as an antigen associated with cancer-associated retinopathy (33Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Google Scholar). When internally dialyzed into rod outer segments (ROS), Rv prolongs the photoresponse (14Gray-Keller M.P. Polans A.S. Palczewski K. Detwiler P.B. Neuron. 1993; 10: 523-531Google Scholar). This in vivo effect of Rv is consistent with the in vitro observation that S-modulin, a frog homologue of Rv, enhances the effect of light on cGMP phosphodiesterase and inhibits rhodopsin phosphorylation (19Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Google Scholar). A similar effect of bovine Rv has been reported (19Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that Rv interacts with rhodopsin kinase (RK) since Rv coeluted with a 67-kDa protein on a sizing column in the presence of Ca2+ (12Gorodovikova E.N. Phillipov P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 277-279Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of Rv purified from bovine retinas is heterogeneously acylated by one of four fatty acids, C14:0, C14:1, C14:2, or C12:0 (8Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16033-16036Google Scholar). N-acylation of Rv plays an essential role in Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting (9Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.-K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Google Scholar) through a novel calcium-myristoyl protein switch mechanism (44Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Google Scholar). However, N-terminal myristoylation is not required for Rv to inhibit rhodopsin phosphorylation (6Chen C.-K. Hurley J.B. Invest. Ophthamol. & Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 1485Google Scholar; 22Kawamura S. Cox J.A. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 121-127Google Scholar). This suggests that binding of Rv to ROS membranes is not necessary for its inhibitory effect. A recent report demonstrated that an N-terminal myristoyl residue lowers the apparent Ca2+ affinity of Rv, but introduces cooperative binding of Ca2+. Nonacylated Rv (NA-Rv) binds two Ca2+ with affinities of 0.11 and 6.9 μM, respectively. Myristoylated Rv (C14:0-Rv) binds two Ca2+ with an affinity of 17 μM and a Hill coefficient of 1.75. The affinity of C14:0-Rv for Ca2+ in the presence of membranes was calculated to be 4 μM according to a concerted allosteric model (1Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Google Scholar). There are disparate reports about the Ca2+ dependence of recoverin's effect on rhodopsin phosphorylation. Original reports indicated that the IC50 for both Rv and S-modulin was 100-200 nM free Ca2+, but a recent study indicates that the IC50 may be significantly higher (24Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): A48Google Scholar). We have characterized recoverin's effect on rhodopsin phosphorylation in vitro to gain insight as to how Rv functions in vivo. Our aim was to identify soluble retinal proteins that interact with Rv, and we found that RK interacts with immobilized Rv in a specific and Ca2+-dependent manner. RK, affinity-purified by immobilized Rv, phosphorylates rhodopsin in response to light when reconstituted with urea-stripped ROS membranes. When only a small fraction of rhodopsin is photolyzed in the reconstituted system, as many as 700 phosphates are incorporated per photolyzed rhodopsin. These results suggest that nonphotolyzed rhodopsins are also being phosphorylated in response to light. Similar “high gain” phosphorylation has been reported by 4Binder B.M. Biernbaum M.S. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15333-15340Google Scholar using electropermeabilized frog ROS. When Rv is added to our reconstituted system, high gain phosphorylation is reduced in a Ca2+-titratable manner. C14:0-Rv and NA-Rv were produced as described (39Ray S. Zozulya S. Niemi G.A. Flaherty K.M. Brolley D. Dizhoor A.M. McKay D.B. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5705-5709Google Scholar). The extent of myristoylation of the C14:0-Rv preparation was determined to be >99% using liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray mass spectrometry (data not shown). CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) was washed with 50 mM HCl for 30 min and incubated with 100 mM sodium borate (pH 8.5) at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were then washed with 100 mM sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.3) and 200 mM NaCl. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. Rv (1.5 mg/ml of beads) was then added to the slurry. The slurry was gently shaken at 4°C for 6 h, the coupling was blocked by adding Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 100 mM, and incubation was continued for another 2 h. The coupling efficiency was typically >99%. The beads were stored at 4°C in ROS-Ca1 buffer (20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 30 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM CaCl2, and 200 μM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) with 0.02% sodium azide. 100 frozen bovine retinas (Excel) were suspended and shaken in ROS buffer (ROS-Ca1 buffer without 1 mM CaCl2) containing 47% sucrose and then centrifuged at 30,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of ROS buffer and centrifuged at 30,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and spun at 100,000 × g at 4°C for another 90 min. All preparative work for retinal extracts was done in a dark room under infrared illumination. The supernatant was applied to Rv columns, and the columns were washed extensively with ROS buffer until no protein washed off as judged by the Bradford assay. Bound proteins were eluted with ROS buffer containing 5 mM EGTA. Retinal extracts prepared from 50 frozen bovine retinas were applied to a 1 × 15-cm NA-Rv column. The column was washed extensively with ROS buffer and two additional high salt washes (see Fig. 2A) before EGTA elution. The high salt washes removed most of the weakly bound tubulins. In the experiments described in Fig. 3–8, Sf9 cell extracts containing recombinant RK (38Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Google Scholar) were used as starting material. Affinity-purified RK was further purified by DE-52 column chromatography. In brief, the EGTA eluate from the NA-Rv column was diluted 1:1 with Buffer D (20 mM MOPS (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 μM CaCl2) and applied to a 2.5 × 20-cm DE-52 column (Whatman). Bound RK was eluted with a 250-ml linear gradient of 0-400 mM NaCl in Buffer D. ROS membranes were washed and sonicated in 6 M urea in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mM EDTA for 10 min in the dark (40Shichi H. Somers R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7040-7046Google Scholar). After urea treatment, the ROS membranes were washed extensively with TM buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 4 mM MgCl2). Endogenous RK activity was inactivated by urea treatments.Figure 3:Phosphate incorporation into rhodopsin as a function of RK concentration: reconstitution of purified Rv, RK, and urea-stripped ROS membranes. Rhodopsin phosphorylation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effect of RK concentration on the amount of phosphate incorporated per bleached rhodopsin (*R) is shown when no Rv (open triangles), 35 μM NA-Rv (open circles), or 8 μM C14:0-Rv (closed circles) was present. The final concentrations of ATP, free Ca2+, and urea-stripped ROS membranes (expressed as concentration of rhodopsin) in the assay were 500, 100, and 25 μM, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 8:Rv does not inhibit rhodopsin phosphorylation catalyzed by β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1. A, β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1) does not bind Rv. Sf9 cell extracts containing recombinant β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 were passed through immobilized NA-Rv, and the binding of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 was examined by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (lanes 1-3) and by immunoblotting using an antibody specific to β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (lanes 4-6). Lanes 1 and 3, 10 μg of Sf9 extracts containing recombinant β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1; lanes 2 and 4, 10 μg of flow-through fraction; lanes 3 and 6, EGTA eluate. Since we overdeveloped the immunoblot to determine if traces of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 bound to NA-Rv, the lower bands shown underneath β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 in lanes 4 and 5 are background. B, Rv does not inhibit the phosphorylation of rhodopsin catalyzed by β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1. Hatched bars represent RK activities, and solid bars represent β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 activities. Relative activities are expressed as percentages of each kinase activity at 100 μM CaCl2 when no Rv was present. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Purified recombinant RK, TM buffer, and urea-stripped ROS membranes were mixed in the dark, with or without Rv, under infrared illumination. [γ-32P]ATP (500-2000 cpm/pmol, 500 μM final concentration) was added to make a total volume of 20 μl. 30 s after ATP was added, a test flash that bleached 0.04% rhodopsin was given, and the reaction was allowed to proceed after the flash for a time course as depicted in Fig. 5 or, in most cases, for 40 min in the dark at room temperature. Reactions without flashes were used as blanks. Each reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The phosphorylation of rhodopsin was visualized by autoradiography after 12% SDS-PAGE. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into rhodopsin was measured by cutting the rhodopsin bands from the gel, incubating the gel slices with 30% H2O2 at 65°C for 60 min, and subsequent liquid scintillation counting. The blank, a sample not exposed to light (typically 5% of the maximal activity observed and never >20-25% of the light-exposed samples in experiments designed to quantitate high gain phosphorylation), was subtracted to reveal light-dependent phosphorylation.

[γ-32P]ATP (2000 cpm/pmol, 50 μM final concentration) was added to make a total volume of 20 μl. 10 s after ATP was added, a test flash that bleached 5% rhodopsin was given, and the reaction was allowed to proceed after the flash for 2 min in the dark at room temperature. Reactions not exposed to light were used as blanks. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The amount of rhodopsin phosphorylation was analyzed as described above. Blanks that were ~5% of the maximal activity were subtracted to reveal light-dependent phosphorylation. To identify proteins that bind Rv, either C14:0-Rv or NA-Rv was linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose to make an immobilized Rv column. A retinal extract in 1 mM Ca2+ was then passed over the column. The column was rinsed with 1 mM Ca2+, and then Ca2+-dependent Rv-binding proteins were eluted with 5 mM EGTA. Three proteins (140, 64, and 52 kDa in size) bound to immobilized C14:0-Rv (Fig. 1A, lane 3) in the presence of Ca2+ and eluted when Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA. Only the 64- and 52-kDa proteins bound to immobilized NA-Rv (Fig. 1A, lane 5). The 140-kDa protein was further purified by Mono-Q fast performance liquid chromatography, and its N-terminal sequence was determined by Edman degradation as FQPSLVLEMAQVXLDNYXFP. Comparison of this sequence with PIR Protein Data Base identified the 140-kDa protein as bovine interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). We also purified the 52-kDa protein(s) by reverse-phase fast performance liquid chromatography and found the following N-terminal sequence: MREI(I/V)(H/S). Sequence analysis identified this as the combined N-terminal sequences of tubulin α- and β-subunits. The identities of these 52-kDa proteins were further confirmed by immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibodies against tubulin on immunoblots (data not shown). The 64-kDa protein was recognized by antibodies against bovine RK (Fig. 1B) (34Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Lebioda L. Crabb J.W. Polans A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6004-6013Google Scholar; 17Inglese J. Glickman J.F. Lorenz W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1422-1425Google Scholar). The identification of the 64-kDa protein as RK was confirmed by purifying it on an NA-Rv column (Fig. 2A) and demonstrating its ability to phosphorylate bleached rhodopsin (data not shown). The purified 64-kDa protein also undergoes autophosphorylation (Fig. 2, A (inset) and B), consistent with its identification as RK (23Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2632-2639Google Scholar). The NA-Rv column nearly quantitatively depleted RK from retinal extracts. Bound RK eluted when Ca2+ was removed by washing the column with buffer containing EGTA. Based on this Ca2+-dependent interaction, we developed a method to purify RK from crude retinal extracts as shown in Fig. 2A. The NA-Rv column was chosen rather than a C14:0-Rv column because it did not bind IRBP and it appears to have a higher capacity for RK. It appears that purified retinal RK is farnesylated since it has the same mobility as recombinant farnesylated RK (data not shown) and has a mobility distinct from RKC558S, a non-farnesylated form of RK (35Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Google Scholar). The yield of RK purified by this scheme from retinal extracts ranges from 10 to 20 μg/50 retinas. Using a baculovirus expression system for RK, we can typically purify 500 μg of expressed RK from 1 liter of Sf9 cell cultures.2 2C.-K. Chen, J. Inglese, E. Faurobert, D. H.-F. Teng, R. J. Lefkowitz, and J. B. Hurley, manuscript in preparation. To determine if the effect of Rv on rhodopsin phosphorylation involves RK and to determine whether this effect requires any soluble protein in addition to RK, we reconstituted urea-stripped ROS membranes, purified recombinant RK (Fig. 2B), and either C14:0-Rv or NA-Rv. Purified recombinant RK, when reconstituted with urea-stripped ROS membranes, catalyzed the light-dependent incorporation of as many as several hundred phosphates into the rhodopsin pool for every rhodopsin that was photolyzed. This indicates that nonphotolyzed rhodopsin is being phosphorylated in response to light. This high gain phosphorylation can be seen in Fig. 3. The extent of high gain phosphorylation increased as RK concentration was raised. High gain phosphorylation was most prominent when only a small fraction of rhodopsin was bleached (Fig. 4). In the presence of Rv and Ca2+, the high gain phosphorylation appears to be quenched (Figure 5:, Figure 3: and Fig. 4). When the effect of recoverin was titrated with free Ca2+ buffered by 2.5 mM Br2-BAPTA, both NA-Rv and C14:0-Rv had an EC50 for free Ca2+ of 3 μM, but the presence of a covalently attached myristoyl residue appears to introduce cooperativity to the inhibitory effect (Fig. 6). The Hill coefficient (nH) of the Ca2+ effect for NA-Rv is 0.7, and the nH for C14:0-Rv is 1.5. The covalently attached myristoyl residue also enhances the inhibitory effect of Rv. The IC50 for C14:0Rv is 0.8 μM, and the IC50 for NA-Rv is 8 μM at saturating Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 7).Figure 6:Effect of free Ca2+ concentration on the inhibitory effect of Rv on RK activity. Rhodopsin phosphorylation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The free Ca2+ concentration was controlled by buffering with 2.5 mM Br2-BAPTA and was verified by a Ca2+-sensitive electrode (Orion) calibrated using commercially available standards (World Precision Instruments, Inc.). The effect of Ca2+ on the amount of phosphate incorporated per bleached rhodopsin (*R) is shown when no Rv (open triangles), 18 μM NA-Rv (open circles), or 7 μM C14:0-Rv (closed circles) was present. The final concentrations of ATP, RK, and urea-stripped ROS membranes were 500 μM, 200 nM, and 12.8 μM, respectively. Similar results were obtained from two triplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7:Inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation by Rv. Rhodopsin phosphorylation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effect of increasing NA-Rv (open circles) and C14:0-Rv (closed circles) concentrations on relative RK activity (100% when no Rv was present) is shown. The final concentrations of ATP, free Ca2+, and urea-stripped ROS membranes were 500, 100, and 20 μM, respectively. RK was present at either 180 or 320 nM. Similar results were obtained from two triplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our results using immobilized recoverin demonstrate a direct and specific interaction between Rv and RK, but they do not address the importance of the Rv/RK interaction for the inhibitory effect of Rv on rhodopsin phosphorylation. It is conceivable that inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation may involve additional interactions of Rv, perhaps with rhodopsin (7Dizhoor A.M. Ray S. Kumar S. Niemi G. Spencer M. Brolley D. Walsh K.A. Philippov P.P. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Science. 1991; 251: 915-918Google Scholar) or with phospholipids (8Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16033-16036Google Scholar; 9Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.-K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of recoverin's action, we sought to determine whether Rv interacts with other members of the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase family such as β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (18Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Google Scholar). β-Adrenergic receptor kinase 1, like RK, phosphorylates rhodopsin in a light-dependent fashion in vitro (3Benovic J.C. Mayor F. Somers R.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1986; 322: 869-872Google Scholar). Fig. 8A shows that recombinant β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 does not bind to immobilized recoverin. As would be expected from the data in Fig. 8A, the phosphorylation of photoactivated rhodopsin by β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 is not inhibited by Rv (Fig. 8B). These results were obtained in the presence of the bovine brain Gβγ, a cofactor required for maximal β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 activity, but similar results were also obtained in the absence of Gβγ (data not shown). These results show that the interaction between Rv and RK is essential for the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate for the first time that there is a direct Ca2+-dependent interaction between Rv and RK (Figure 1:, Figure 2:A). The Rv/RK interaction is highly specific because Rv does not interact with other members of the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase family such as β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (Fig. 8A). By developing a reconstituted rhodopsin phosphorylation system, we have shown that RK, purified using immobilized Rv as an affinity matrix, is active and catalyzes the incorporation of as many as several hundred phosphates/photolyzed rhodopsin into the rhodopsin pool (high gain phosphorylation). Since Rv inhibits rhodopsin phosphorylation in this reconstituted system, no other soluble factor is required for the inhibitory effect of Rv. Comparison of the extent of RK binding to immobilized C14:0-Rv versus NA-Rv suggests that the myristoyl moiety on Rv interferes with RK binding. A typical example of this is shown in Fig. 1. A possible explanation for this is that there may be competition between RK and IRBP for binding sites on immobilized C14:0-Rv. It could also be that immobilized NA-Rv has a higher affinity for RK than immobilized C14:0-Rv. We found that Rv also binds to IRBP and tubulin. Ca2+-dependent binding of IRBP to Rv requires N-terminal myristoylation of Rv. It has been reported that IRBP binds a variety of fatty acids (2Bazan N.G. Reddy T.S. Redmond T.M. Wiggert B. Chader G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13677-13680Google Scholar). This suggests that IRBP binds to the N-terminal myristoyl residue of Rv that becomes exposed when Rv binds Ca2+ (9Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.-K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Google Scholar), as depicted by the calcium-myristoyl protein switch model. However, it is unlikely that IRBP interacts with Rv within the retina because IRBP resides in the extracellular interphotoreceptor matrix (5Bunt-Milam A.H. Saari J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 703-712Google Scholar), whereas Rv resides primarily within photoreceptors. The binding of tubulin appears weaker than the binding of RK and electrostatic in nature because it can be disrupted by high ionic strength (Fig. 2). We have not attempted to address whether or not the Rv/tubulin interaction is physiologically relevant. A direct interaction between Rv and RK was suggested by a previous report in which Rv coeluted with a 67-kDa protein, presumably RK, during gel filtration chromatography (12Gorodovikova E.N. Phillipov P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 277-279Google Scholar). Our findings provide direct evidence that Rv interacts with RK in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We also found that C14:0-Rv is a better inhibitor than NA-Rv. This suggests that the interaction of Rv with ROS membranes enhances the inhibitory effect. The observation that β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1, which does not bind Rv, is not inhibited by Rv suggests that the Rv/RK interaction is necessary for the inhibitory effect of recoverin. It has been reported that S-modulin and Rv inhibit rhodopsin phosphorylation, with K1/2 = 100 nM free Ca2+ (9Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.-K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Google Scholar). More recently, the Ca2+ dependence was reported to be significantly higher (24Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): A48Google Scholar). These previous studies used either EGTA or BAPTA to buffer Ca2+. Both EGTA and BAPTA do not buffer well above 1 μM because of their relatively high affinity for Ca2+. We buffered free Ca2+ with Br2-BAPTA (Kd = 1.6 μM for Ca2+) (41Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Google Scholar) in our experiments. The EC50 for the Rv effect on rhodopsin phosphorylation is 3 μM for both NA-Rv and C14:0-Rv. Interestingly, the presence of a covalently attached myristoyl residue does not affect the EC50, but introduces an apparent cooperativity. A similar effect of myristoylation on the affinity of Rv for Ca2+ has recently been reported (1Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Google Scholar). Both the Ca2+ affinity for C14:0-Rv and the Ca2+ dependence of the inhibitory effect of Rv require Ca2+ concentrations significantly higher than the bulk intracellular free Ca2+ levels detected by dye measurements in vertebrate photoreceptors (11Gorczyca W.A. Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4014-4018Google Scholar). What accounts for this apparent discrepancy? One possibility is that Rv functions in a local environment, e.g. close to the plasma membrane, where the local free Ca2+ concentration may be different from the bulk free Ca2+ concentration. Another possible explanation may be that membranes stabilize the Ca2+-bound form of Rv by binding the myristoyl group. According to a concerted allosteric model that was adapted to the calcium-myristoyl protein switch mechanism (8Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16033-16036Google Scholar) to interpret the difference in Ca2+ binding to NA-Rv and C14:0-Rv, the presence of a membrane environment increases the affinity of C14:0-Rv for Ca2+ (1Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Google Scholar). It will be necessary to show an increase in Ca2+ affinity for Rv in the presence of membranes and/or RK to experimentally support this idea. Alternatively, Rv may require other proteins absent from our reconstituted system to operate in the physiological range of free Ca2+ concentration. It was previously reported that light activation of one rhodopsin molecule stimulates the phosphorylation of hundreds of nonphotolyzed rhodopsins in electropermeabilized frog ROS preparations (4Binder B.M. Biernbaum M.S. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15333-15340Google Scholar). This high gain phosphorylation was attributed to the intactness of isolated ROS structure preserved in the preparations used. The kinase responsible for high gain phosphorylation was not identified, and more recently, it was suggested that protein kinase C could be responsible for high gain phosphorylation (31Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18181-18186Google Scholar). Our results, however, demonstrate that highly purified RK itself can produce high gain phosphorylation when reconstituted with urea-stripped ROS membranes. The extent of high gain phosphorylation is proportional to the amount of RK present (Fig. 3). The requirement for the structure intactness reported by 4Binder B.M. Biernbaum M.S. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15333-15340Google Scholar may reflect dilution of RK when ROS are homogenized. It has also been reported that RK can phosphorylate a synthetic peptide derived from the C-terminal cytoplasmic loop of rhodopsin when RK is stimulated by a truncated form of photolyzed rhodopsin (33Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which RK is activated to carry out high gain phosphorylation is not yet clear. In our reconstituted system, the extent of high gain phosphorylation is not saturated at 1 μM RK even though the amount of photolyzed rhodopsin is only 10 nM. This might reflect either a catalytic mechanism by which photolyzed rhodopsin stimulates RK or, alternatively, a weak affinity of RK for photolyzed rhodopsin. The reconstitution of high gain phosphorylation using purified RK reported in this paper lays the groundwork for a study of the role of high gain phosphorylation in photoreceptor light adaptation. Experiments that assess the link between the extent of rhodopsin phosphorylation and the level of transducin activation are now in progress to examine if high gain phosphorylation indeed regulates the gain of phototransduction. Finally, the specific and Ca2+-dependent Rv/RK interaction may represent a model protein/protein interaction that exists between the members of the newly identified neuronal specific Ca2+-binding protein family represented by Rv and the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase family represented by RK.

Using cDNA probes from the recently identified elasmobranch secretory Na-K-Cl cotransporter (sNKCC1) (Xu, J. C., Lytle, C. Zhu, T. T., Payne, J. A., Benz, E., and Forbush, B., III(1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 91, 2201-2205), we have identified the human homologue. By screening cDNA libraries of a human colonic carcinoma line, T84 cell, we identified a sequence of 4115 bases from overlapping clones. The deduced protein is 1212 amino acids in length, and analysis of the primary structure indicates 12 transmembrane segments. The primary structure is 74% identical to sNKCC1, 91% identical to a mouse Na-K-Cl cotransporter (mNKCC1), 58% identical to rabbit and rat renal Na-K-Cl cotransporters (NKCC2), and 43% identical to the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporters from flounder urinary bladder and rat kidney. Similar to sNKCC1 and mNKCC1, the 5′-end of the human colonic cotransporter is rich in G+C content. Interestingly, a triple repeat (GCG)7 occurs within the 5′-coding region and contributes to a large alanine repeat (Ala15). Two sites for N-linked glycosylation are predicted on an extracellular loop between putative transmembrane segments 7 and 8. A single potential site for phosphorylation by protein kinase A is present in the predicted cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis revealed a 7.4-7.5-kilobase transcript in T84 cells and shark rectal gland and a ~7.2-kilobase transcript in mammalian colon, kidney, lung, and stomach. Metaphase spreads from lymphocytes were probed with biotin-labeled cDNA and avidin fluorescein (the cotransporter gene was localized to human chromosome 5 at position 5q23.3). Human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with the full-length cDNA expressed a ~170-kDa protein recognized by anti-cotransporter antibodies. Following treatment with N-glycosidase F, the molecular mass of the expressed protein was similar to that predicted for the core protein from the cDNA sequence (132-kDa) and identical to that of deglycosylated T84 cotransporter (~135-kDa). The stably transfected cells exhibited a ~15-fold greater bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb influx than control cells, and this flux required external sodium and chloride. Flux kinetics were consistent with an electroneutral cotransport of 1Na:1K:2Cl. Preincubation in chloride-free media was necessary to activate fully the expressed cotransporter, suggesting a [Cl]-dependent regulatory mechanism. By moving chloride into epithelial cells, the Na-K-Cl cotransporter aids transcellular movement of chloride across both secretory and absorptive epithelia.

Preincubation in chloride-free media was necessary to activate fully the expressed cotransporter, suggesting a [Cl]-dependent regulatory mechanism. The vectorial transport of chloride across epithelia is a prominent mechanism in the maintenance of water and electrolyte homeostasis. Chloride transport is involved in reabsorption of NaCl in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in mammalian kidney (1Greger R. Schlatter E. Pflgers Arch. 1981; 392: 92-94Google Scholar) and in secretion of NaCl in a diverse array of secretory epithelia, including the intestine, trachea, and parotid and the avian and elasmobranch salt glands(2Dharmsathaphorn K. Mandel K.G. Masui H. McRoberts J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 462-471Google Scholar, 3Fong P. Chao A.C. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L290-L295Google Scholar, 4Turner R.J. George J.N.

Friedman D. Kinne R. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 73-83Google Scholar). In all of these tissues, the chloride entry into the epithelia cell is mediated by a Na-K-Cl cotransport protein, which couples the electroneutral movement of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions. In order to carry out net salt transport, the Na-K-Cl cotransporter functions in concert with three other membrane proteins: chloride and potassium channels and the sodium pump. The importance of the proper functioning of these ion transport mechanisms in chloride secretory epithelia is exemplified by the disease states of cystic fibrosis and secretory diarrhea, where there are defects in the regulation of ion transport(7Halm D.R. Frizzell R.A. Lebenthal E. Duffy M. Textbook of Secretory Diarrhea. Raven Press Ltd., New York1990: 47-58Google Scholar). The Na-K-Cl cotransporter is characterized by a sensitivity to the sulfamoylbenzoic acid “loop” diuretics, furosemide, and bumetanide and a strict ion dependence of transport (for review, see (8Haas M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C869-C885Google Scholar)). Among the Na-K-Cl cotransporters that have been described in various cells and tissues, there is substantial variation in both molecular weight and “loop” diuretic sensitivity(9Haas M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 443-457Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of different isoforms. For example, studies using the photosensitive bumetanide analog, 4-[3H]benzoyl-5-sulfamoyl-3-(3-thenyloxy) benzoic acid, have demonstrated the specific labeling of a ~150-kDa protein in membranes from dog kidney(10Haas M. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C243-C250Google Scholar), mouse kidney(11Haas M. Dunham P.B. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C791-C804Google Scholar), and duck red blood cells(12Haas M. Forbush III, B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 939: 131-144Google Scholar), whereas in shark rectal gland membranes, a ~195-kDa protein is observed(13Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Haas M. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25428-25437Google Scholar). Secretory epithelia, such as the rectal gland and parotid gland typically show a 10-fold lower affinity for bumetanide than absorptive epithelia, such as the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle of mammalian kidney and flounder intestine(8Haas M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C869-C885Google Scholar). Additionally, in absorptive and secretory epithelia, the Na-K-Cl cotransporter displays distinct differences in its polarized membrane distribution. In secretory epithelia, the Na-K-Cl cotransporter is an exclusively basolateral membrane protein, whereas in absorptive epithelia it is localized to the apical membrane(14O'Grady S.M. Palfrey C. Field M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C177-C192Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the cloning, sequencing, and expression of a cDNA encoding the basolateral Na-K-Cl cotransporter from the shark rectal gland (sNKCC1)1 1The abbreviations used are: sNKCC1basolateral Na-K-Cl cotransporter from the shark rectal glandNKCCNa-K-Cl cotransporterkbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)TMtransmembrane segmentHEKhuman embryonic kidneyCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

In the present report, we have utilized homology to sNKCC1 to obtain the cDNA encoding the basolateral Na-K-Cl cotransporter (hNKCC1) from a human intestinal cell line, the T84 cell. The human Na-K-Cl cotransporter displays remarkable identity to sNKCC1 within the predicted transmembrane segments (88%), yet when examined in the same expression system, hNKCC1 exhibits considerably different ion affinities compared with sNKCC1. basolateral Na-K-Cl cotransporter from the shark rectal gland Na-K-Cl cotransporter kilobase(s) base pair(s) transmembrane segment human embryonic kidney 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. A human colonic (T84 epithelial cell line) cDNA library in Uni-Zap XR was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). This library was screened with two 32P-labeled cDNA probes derived from the shark rectal gland Na-K-Cl cotransporter (nucleotides −298 to 1235 and 1236 to 3411; see (15Xu J.C. Lytle C. Zhu T. Payne J.A. Benz E. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2201-2205Google Scholar)). Using low stringency hybridization (34°C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml fish sperm DNA) and high stringency wash conditions (55°C in 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS), a single positive clone (TEF 1-1) was identified, carried through two rounds of plaque purification, and successfully excised into Bluescript SK- with the helper phage R408. A second T84 cDNA library in λZAP obtained from Dr. John R. Riordan (Hospital for Sick Children; Toronto, Ontario, Canada) was screened with a 5′-end 0.7-kb XbaI-XbaI fragment of TEF 1-1. Using similar screening procedures as described above, 23 positive cDNAs were obtained in Bluescript SK- (see Fig. 1). All cDNAs were characterized by Southern blot analysis and partial sequencing. The full-length cDNA was sequenced bidirectionally by the dideoxy chain termination method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using a combination of manual sequencing with Sequenase II (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems Inc.) with synthetic oligonucleotide primers and fluorescent dideoxy terminators. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence were performed with programs from the Genetics Computer Group software. The program TBLASTN (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-441Google Scholar) was used to search GenBank. Identities with other sequences are given as the fraction of residues in hNKCC1, which are found to be identical in the matched sequence. T84 cells were obtained from Dr. James L. Madara (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) and cultured as described previously(20Dharmsathaphorn K. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from fresh rabbit tissues, spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) rectal gland, and T84 cells by the guanidine thiocyanate method(21Chomczynski P. Sachi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA using magnetic beads (PolyATtract, Promega Corp.). Samples of rabbit tissue mRNA were denatured by heating to 65°C in formamide and formaldehyde and size-fractionated on a 1% agarose gel. Fractionated mRNA was transferred to a nylon membrane by semidry blotting. The rabbit tissue Northern blot used in this study was the one used in (16Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4544-4548Google Scholar). The membrane was completely stripped of previously hybridized probe by incubating in 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS at 75°C, and confirmation of probe removal was determined by film exposure (48 h at −70°C). A blot of human tissue mRNA was obtained commercially (Clonetech, human MTN blot, 7760-1, lot 52805). The blots were prehybridized 4 h at 45°C in 50% formamide, 2 × SSPE, 2 × Denhardt's, 1% SDS, 200 μg/ml yeast RNA, 100 μg/ml fish sperm DNA and then hybridized for 24 h in fresh hybridization solution containing 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled cRNA probe. Antisense cRNA probes were produced as run-off transcripts (MAXIscript, Ambion Inc) (nucleotides 650-1102 for Fig. 5a and nucleotides 796-1926 for Fig. 5b) from cDNA clones. The blots were subjected to a final wash of 20 min at 65°C in 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS and analyzed by autoradiography at −70°C with an intensifying screen. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed as described previously(22Haas M. Ward D. Lee J. Roses A.D. Clarke V. E'Eustachio P. Lau D. Vega Saen de Miera E. Rudy B. Mammalian Genome. 1993; 4: 711-715Google Scholar). Metaphase spreads were prepared from human peripheral blood lymphocytes after methotrexate synchronization and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Probes were assigned to R bands generated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and subsequent photolysis(23Arnold N. Bhatt M. Ried T. Ward D.C. Wienberg J. Kessler C. Techniques and Methods in Molecular Biology: Nonradioactive Labelling and Detection of Biomolecules. SpringerVerlag, New York1993: 324-334Google Scholar). Briefly, TEF 1-1 cDNA was labeled with 11-biotin dUTP by nick translation. The probe DNA (60 ng) was coprecipitated with 3 μg of human Cot 1 DNA plus 6 μg of salmon sperm DNA. After resuspension in 12 μl of hybridization solution (50% formamide, 2 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate) the DNA was denatured at 75°C for 10 min. Denatured DNA was applied directly to denatured metaphase spreads (50% formamide and 2 × SSC for 2 min at 70°C). The slides were incubated for 12 h at 37°C, washed 3 times in 42% formamide and 2 × SSC at 42°C, washed 3 additional times at low stringency (1 × SSC, 40°C), blocked with bovine serum albumin (3% in 4 × SSC for 30 min at 37°C), and stained with Hoechst 33258 (2.5 mg/ml) for 15 min. After washing briefly with distilled water, they were placed under a UV lamp at a distance of 10 cm for 1 h; they were subsequently incubated for an additional hour in 2 × SSC at 42°C. Avidin-DCS-fluorescein isothiocynate (Vector Laboratories) in 1% bovine serum albumin and 4 × SSC was used to detect probe sequences in which 11-biotin dUTP had been incorporated, and, after incubation for 30 min at 37°C, the slides were washed 3 times in 4 × SSC and 1% Tween 20 for 5 min at 42°C. Propidium iodide (200 ng/ml) in antifade (Dabco) was used to counterstain chromosomes. A CCD camera (PM512, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) was used to visualize fluorescent signals; gray scale images were obtained sequentially for fluorescein and propidium iodide with precision filter sets (C. Zeiss), and the images were pseudocolored and merged. A full-length construct of the sequence for the human colonic Na-K-Cl cotransporter was prepared from the two cDNAs, TEF 11a and TEF 1-1 (see Fig. 1). Much of the 5′-untranslated region and all of the intronic DNA were removed from TEF 11a by subcloning a PstI-PstI fragment into Bluescript KS- (nucleotides −24 to 831). The small subcloned fragment of TEF 11a and the cDNA of TEF 1-1 were ligated at a common NcoI site and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pJB20 at EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites of the polylinker(24Beck P.J. Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4612-4622Google Scholar). Transcription of the insert is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, and the vector contains a neomycin (G418) resistance gene. The human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK-293) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) in a humidified incubator (5% CO2 at 37°C). The full-length construct was transfected into HEK-293 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation(25Puddington L. Woodgett C. Rose J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2756-2760Google Scholar). Nearly confluent cells were split 1:6 the day before transfection and were 50-70% confluent in a 10-cm dish immediately prior to transfection with 20 μg of DNA in 140 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES, 0.75 mM Na2HPO4, 125 mM CaCl2, pH 7.05. 48 h after transfection, cells were selected for neomycin resistance by growth in G418 (900 μg/ml), and after 3 weeks, single resistant colonies were amplified and screened by 86Rb influx measurements and Western blotting. CHAPS-solubilized membrane protein (50 μg) was deglycosylated by incubation (4 h at 37°C) with 20 units/ml of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) in a 0.05-ml solution containing 4% CHAPS, 0.15 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 2.5 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Enzymatic treatment was terminated by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer. HEK-293 cells were subcultured into 96-well plates (1:5 split) and grown to confluency (2-3 days). Prior to the flux assay, the cells were preincubated for 1 h in a low chloride hypotonic medium (1:2 dilution of isotonic low chloride medium but lacking ouabain) and then briefly washed in a low chloride isotonic medium containing 135 mM sodium gluconate, 5 mM potassium gluconate, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaHPO4, 2 mM Na2SO4, 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mM ouabain. The initial rate of 86Rb influx was determined in quadruplicate wells in the presence or absence of 200 μM bumetanide. Uptake was determined in isotonic medium in which 86Rb (1 μCi/ml) replaced potassium. Influx was terminated after 0.5 min by the addition of an ice-cold, high potassium saline followed by five rinses in phosphate-buffered saline. Cellular extracts (80 μl of 2% SDS) were assayed for 86Rb by Cherenkov radiation, for protein with the Micro BCA protein kit (Pierce) and for Na-K-Cl cotransporter production by Western blot analysis(13Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Haas M. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25428-25437Google Scholar). Reported Km and Ki values were obtained from nonlinear least squares fits to the data using one- or two-site (for chloride) models. Western blot analysis made use of a monoclonal antibody (T10) produced against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the hydrophilic C terminus of hNKCC1 (amino acids 902-1212).2 2C. Y. Lytle, J.-C. Xu, D. Biemesderfer, and B. Forbush, manuscript in preparation. Clones encoding the bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-Cl cotransporter in human colon (the T84 cell) were initially obtained by screening a cDNA library under low stringency conditions with nonoverlapping fragments of the shark rectal gland Na-K-Cl cotransporter (see “Materials and Methods” and (15Xu J.C. Lytle C. Zhu T. Payne J.A. Benz E. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2201-2205Google Scholar)). The first library screening produced a cDNA (TEF 1-1; Fig. 1) with homology to the rectal gland Na-K-Cl cotransporter with a large open reading frame and poly(A) tail but that lacked the 5′-end of the coding region. A second library was screened with a 5′-end fragment of TEF 1-1 (0.7-kb; see “Materials and Methods”). 23 cDNAs were plaque-purified and excised into Bluescript SK-. Two independent cDNAs (TEF 11a and 20a) extended the 5′-end of TEF 1-1, providing the complete coding region of the human colonic Na-K-Cl cotransporter (Fig. 1). An overlapping nucleotide sequence of 4115-bp was identified, hNKCC1. The 5′-end of hNKCC1 is exceedingly rich in guanine and cytosine nucleotides with the first 900 bases containing 74% (G+C) content. We have reported previously the presence of a (G+C)-rich region at the 5′-end of sNKCC1(15Xu J.C. Lytle C. Zhu T. Payne J.A. Benz E. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2201-2205Google Scholar). Interestingly, within this (G+C)-rich region of hNKCC1 is a triple repeat (GCG)7, which occurs within the coding region and contributes to a large alanine repeat (Ala93- Ala107; Fig. 2). This same triple repeat is observed in the putative basolateral Na-K-Cl cotransporter from mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells, mNKCC1(26Delpire E. Rauchman M.I. Beier D.R. Hebert S.C. Gullans S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25677-25683Google Scholar). 3 3The secretory and absorptive isoforms of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter are designated NKCC1 (15) and NKCC2 (16), respectively. The alternate designation BSC2 and BSC1 have also been employed (17, 26). Since alanine is assigned a positive hydropathic index (i.e. hydrophobic residue) by Kyte and Doolittle(42Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar), the large alanine repeat encoded by the GCG trinucleotide repeat is responsible for the very hydrophobic region (residues color-coded red), which appears within the otherwise hydrophilic N-terminal domain of Fig. 3A.Figure 3:Hypothetical model of the human colonic Na-K-Cl cotransporter. The amino acid residues are color-coded by hydropathic index (A) as determined by the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm (42Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) or by the fractional identity of hNKCC1 to sNKCC1 (B). Both the hydropathic index and identity are averaged over a running window of 15 amino acids. Potential glycosylation sites between putative transmembrane segments 7 and 8 are indicated by branched lines. Secondary structural elements predicted by the PHD program (45Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-77Google Scholar, 46Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Science. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) are shown (helices, α; wavy lines, β). No attempt has been made to pair β structural elements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The hNKCC1 cDNA includes a full-length open reading frame encoding 1212 amino acids, beginning with the first ATG (GCTATGG) downstream of a stop codon. The predicted molecular mass is 132 kDa, which is very similar to the core polypeptide identified in N-glycosidase-F-treated membranes from T84 cells with monoclonal antibodies developed against the shark rectal gland Na-K-Cl cotransporter (~135-kDa)(27Lytle C. Torchia J. Forbush III, B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100 (abstr.): 39Google Scholar). The full-length amino acid sequence of hNKCC1 is 93% identical to mNKCC1 and 73% identical to sNKCC1 (Fig. 2). The most divergent region is the N terminus, which includes a number of insertions and deletions when compared with mNKCC1 and sNKCC1. Outside of this area, hNKCC1 aligns perfectly with mNKCC1. We noted that a number of the clones isolated from one of the libraries contained intronic sequences with consensus splice sites for intron-exon boundaries ((28Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Google Scholar), Fig. 1). Many of these clones were undoubtedly produced from incompletely processed mRNA during library construction (see (29Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Trsui L.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Google Scholar)). This finding allowed us to identify some of the exons in the hNKCC1 gene (Fig. 1). Interestingly, one cDNA contained consensus splice sites and intronic DNA on either side of a 96-bp exon (Fig. 1, exon B), which corresponds exactly to the position of an alternatively spliced cassette exon in the rabbit kidney Na-K-Cl cotransporter(16Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4544-4548Google Scholar). Similar to previously identified cation-chloride cotransport proteins(15Xu J.C. Lytle C. Zhu T. Payne J.A. Benz E.

A. 1993; 90: 2749-2753Google Scholar), hydropathy analysis of hNKCC1 predicts a large central hydrophobic region bounded by N- and C-terminal hydrophilic domains (Fig. 3A). As displayed in Fig. 3, 12 membrane-spanning α helices are predicted in our model of hNKCC1. Based on homology with sNKCC1, we predict that both terminal domains reside within the cytoplasm. The polypeptide sequence of hNKCC1 has five potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Two of these sites are located in a predicted extracellular hydrophilic region of the protein between putative transmembrane segments 7 and 8 (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). In comparing the primary structure of hNKCC1 to related proteins, we note that among the loops connecting predicted transmembrane domains, those that are predicted to be intracellular are considerably better conserved than are those that are predicted to be extracellular (e.g. sNKCC1, Fig. 3B). The Na-K-Cl cotransporter in the T84 cell is known to be stimulated by agents such as vasoactive intestinal peptide that activate adenylate cyclase(2Dharmsathaphorn K. Mandel K.G. Masui H. McRoberts J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 462-471Google Scholar). Unlike sNKCC1, which has no consensus sites for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, there is a single potential cAMP-dependent protein kinase site in hNKCC1 located within the predicted cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (Ser995; Fig. 2). This residue corresponds to one of three potential cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites in the rabbit kidney Na-K-Cl cotransporter (rNKCC2, Ser878; (16Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4544-4548Google Scholar)). In addition, hNKCC1 contains two threonines (Thr217 and Thr1135; Fig. 2), which correspond to known phosphoacceptors in sNKCC1 (Thr189 and Thr1114; (15Xu J.C. Lytle C. Zhu T. Payne J.A. Benz E. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2201-2205Google Scholar)). The fact that the region around both of these threonine residues in hNKCC and sNKCC1 is very well conserved suggests that these residues are also phosphacceptors in hNKCC1 (Fig. 3B). Using the TEF 1-1 cDNA, we localized the hNKCC1 gene to human chromosome 5 at position 5q23.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization on R-banded chromosomes (Fig. 4). Five separate metaphase spreads were investigated. Two had distinct signals on both homologues of chromosome 5, with signals on all four chromatids. Three others had distinct signals on only one homologue with discrete signals on each chromatid. Evidence of hybridization at other chromosomal regions with TEF 1-1 was not observed. 26Delpire E. Rauchman M.I. Beier D.R. Hebert S.C. Gullans S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25677-25683Google Scholar have recently mapped mNKCC1 to mouse chromosome 18 in a region that they reported to be syntenic with human chromosome 5q31-33. Interestingly, the murine renal absorptive isoform, mNKCC2, has recently been cloned, and the gene localized to mouse chromosome 2(43Quaggin S.E. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Igarashi P. Mamm. Genome. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). These studies clearly distinguish NKCC1 and NKCC2 as separate gene products. The level of expression of hNKCC1 and related transcripts in T84 cells, shark rectal gland, and several rabbit and human tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5). Using antisense cRNA probes, a ~7.2-7.5-kb mRNA was expressed at high levels in T84 cells, rectal gland, rabbit stomach, rabbit kidney, and rabbit large intestine (Fig. 5A) and in all of the human tissues (Fig. 5B). A prominent message is also found at 6.3 kb in human heart and skeletal muscle, and a signal is detect"

The “activated” Ub, linked via a thioester bond to a specific cysteine residue of E1 enzyme, can be transferred to a cysteine residue in one of several Ub-conjugating (E2) enzymes, which catalyze the formation of isopeptide bonds between the C-terminal glycine of Ub and lysine residues of acceptor proteins. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a 114-kDa E1 enzyme is encoded by an essential gene termed UBA1 (McGrath, J. P., Jentsch, S., and Varshavsky, A.(1991) EMBO J. 10, 227-236). We describe the isolation and analysis of another essential gene, termed UBA2, that encodes a 71-kDa protein with extensive sequence similarities to both the UBA1-encoded yeast E1 and E1 enzymes of other organisms. The regions of similarities between Uba1p and Uba2p encompass a putative ATP-binding site as well as a sequence that is highly conserved between the known E1 enzymes and contains the active-site cysteine of E1. This cysteine is shown to be required for an essential function of Uba2p, suggesting that Uba2p-catalyzed reactions involve a transient thioester bond between Uba2p and either Ub or another protein. Uba2p is located largely in the nucleus. The putative nuclear localization signal of Uba2p is near its C terminus. The Uba1p (E1 enzyme) and Uba2p cannot complement each others essential functions even if their subcellular localization is altered by mutagenesis. Uba2p appears to interact with itself and several other S. cerevisiae proteins with apparent molecular masses of 52, 63, 87, and 120 kDa. Uba2p is multiubiquitinated in vivo, suggesting that at least a fraction of Uba2p is metabolically unstable. Uba2p is likely to be a component of the Ub system that functions as either an E2 or E1/E2 enzyme.

The E1 enzyme activates Ub in an ATP-dependent reaction by first adenylating the C-terminal Gly-76 of Ub and thereafter linking this residue to the side chain of a Cys residue in the same E1 molecule, yielding an E1~Ub thioester and free AMP (9Ciechanover A.

In the presence of a Ub-conjugating (E2) enzyme (one of several such enzymes in a cell), the E1-linked Ub is transferred to a Cys residue in E2. The E2 enzymes conjugate their cysteine-linked Ub moiety to its ultimate protein acceptors, yielding isopeptide bond-mediated Ub-protein conjugates (reviewed by 34Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 177-207Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The targeting of proteins for ubiquitination by at least some E2 enzymes involves their association with distinct proteins called recognins, E2s or Ub-protein ligases, which mediate the initial recognition of a substrate by a recognin-E2 complex (11Dohmen R.J.

All of these genes encode 110-120-kDa proteins highly similar in sequence. UBA1, which encodes the 114-kDa E1 enzyme of S. cerevisiae, is essential for cell viability (43McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic analyses of ts85 and analogous temperature-sensitive (ts) mammalian cell lines demonstrated that these cells carry ts mutations in their genes for E1 enzyme, and that the activity of E1 is required for ATP-dependent proteolysis, as well as for other (possibly proteolysis-mediated) cellular functions (18Finley D.

A gene required for spermatogenesis was identified in the Sxr (sex-reversed) region of the mouse Y chromosome and shown to encode an E1 enzyme whose expression is testis-specific (46Mitchel M.J.

We report the isolation and analysis of a novel essential S. cerevisiae gene, termed UBA2, that encodes a 636-residue protein whose amino acid sequence is highly similar to those of E1 enzymes, but whose activity appears to be distinct from that of the known E1 enzymes. S. cerevisiae cultures were grown at 30°C in rich (YP) or synthetic (S) media (55Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) containing either 2% dextrose (YPD or SD media) or 2% galactose (YPG or SG media).

The strain SUB312 (a gift from Dr. D. Finley) (MATa ura3-52 ubi1Δ::TRP1 ubi2-Δ2::ura3 ubi3-Δub2 ubi4-Δ2::LEU2 (pUB100, expressing a non-Ub portion of Ubi1p) (pUB23-X, expressing Ub-βgal from PGAL1) lacks chromosomal sequences encoding Ub and expresses Ub (an essential protein) from the PGAL1 promoter in the plasmid pUB23 (20Finley D.

In the present work, pUb23 of SUB312 were replaced with plasmids YEp96 or YEp105, which expressed Ub or mycUb, respectively, from the PCUP1 promoter (15Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other S. cerevisiae strains were derivatives of JD47-13C (MAT a leu2-3, 112 lys2-801 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ63 ura3-52) (42Madura K. Dohmen R.J. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12046-12054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). JD51, a diploid derivative of JD47-13C, was constructed through a transient expression of HO endonuclease from the plasmid YCp50-HO (29Herskowitz I. Jensen R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 194: 132-146Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The diploid JD90 (uba2Δ::HIS3/UBA2) was produced from JD51 using one-step gene transplacement (52Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The PstI DNA fragment containing the uba2Δ::HIS3 allele used in the transplacement was isolated from pJD346. The latter plasmid was constructed using oligonucleotide-directed deletion (19Finley D. zkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) of the UBA2 gene and simultaneous introduction of a BamHI site, which was used to insert the HIS3 marker as an 1.8-kilobase pair BamHI fragment (HIS3 was isolated from YEp6; 57Struhl K. Stinchcomb D.T. Scherer S. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The strain JD62 (PGAL1-UBA2/UBA2) was produced by integrating the plasmid pJDA9-5 (which had been linearized by a cut with BstXI in the UBA2 part of the plasmid) into the UBA2 locus of the strain JD51. pJDA9-5 was constructed in the background of the vector pRS306 (56Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contained 470 bp of UBA2, from the EcoRI site (which was introduced immediately in front of the ATG start codon using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) to the SmaI site. This 470-bp fragment was ligated to a 500-bp fragment containing the PGAL1 promoter. The latter fragment was generated by first introducing, using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, a SmaI site between the promoters PGAL1and PGAL10 in a fragment originally isolated from of pBM272 (32Hovland P. Flick J. Johnston M. Sclafani R.A. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and thereafter cloning the resulting SmaI-BamHI fragment into the polylinker of pRS306. Integration of the resulting (linearized) pJDA9-5 at the UBA2 locus of the diploid strain JD51 yielded, in one of the two UBA2-containing chromosomes of JD51, a nonfunctional (truncated) copy of UBA2, and the intact UBA2 open reading frame (ORF) expressed from PGAL1. JD62-6A is a haploid MATa segregant of the strain JD62 bearing the altered UBA2 locus. JD77 is a uba1Δ::HIS3/UBA1 derivative of strain JD51. The uba1Δ::HIS3 allele was produced as described by 43McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar. JD77 was transformed with pJD320, a derivative of the CEN6/ARSH4/URA3 vector pRS316 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989) that expressed UBA1 from the PGAL1 promoter. The PGAL1-UBA1 portion of pJD320 was constructed by placing, using PCR, an EcoRI site immediately upstream of the ATG start codon of UBA2. JD77-1A is a haploid MATa segregant of strain JD77 that carries pJD320. Standard methods were used (1Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1992Google Scholar). The UBA2 gene was initially identified in a library of λgt11 phages (63Young R.A. Davis R.W. Science. 1983; 222: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) carrying inserts of S. cerevisiae genomic DNA. Specifically, UBA2 was isolated as a result of a cross-reaction of a UBA2-expressing phage plaque with a polyclonal antiserum raised against a yeast plasma membrane ATPase kinase.3 3H. Forrov, J. Kolarov, and A. Goffeau, unpublished data. An oligonucleotide constructed on the basis of initial sequence analysis was then used to isolate UBA2 clones through plaque hybridization with the EMBL3A phage library of S. cerevisiae genomic DNA (a gift from Dr. R. Young). For mapping and sequencing of UBA2, yeast DNA fragments derived from two overlapping EMBL3A phage inserts were subcloned into YCplac22 (21Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527Crossref PubMed Scopus (2465) Google Scholar), and a restriction map of UBA2 was produced using standard methods. The sequence of UBA2 was determined on both strands using a variety of UBA2 subclones, synthetic oligonucleotides as primers, the chain termination method (Ausubel et al., 1989), and a Sequenase Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A ~3-kilobase pair PstI fragment of the YCplac22-based UBA2-bearing plasmid pJDA2-A contained the UBA2 ORF, ~an 0.6 kilobase pair of the 5’-flanking sequence, and a 3’-flanking region of the UBA2 locus that included part of the adjacent SAC7 gene (13Dunn T.M. Shortle D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2308-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The PstI fragment was subcloned into the phagemid pRS315 (56Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yielding pJDA315. (One PstI site of this fragment was present in the polylinker of YCplac22; the other PstI site was present 3’ to the insert/EMBL3A junction.) In the construction of the uba2Δ, uba2-C177A, and uba2-C177S alleles of UBA2 (see the main text), single-stranded pJDA315 DNA and synthetic oligonucleotides were used as described by 39Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar. To express UBA2 from PCUP1 (derived from YEp46; see below) or PGAL1 (see above), a BglII site was placed in front of the ATG start codon of UBA2 using PCR and synthetic primers. For C-terminal tagging of Uba2p, a KpnI recognition sequence was linked to the 3’ end of the UBA2 ORF using PCR. This KpnI site was then used to link, in-frame, the UBA2 ORF and fragments encoding specific sequence tags. A restriction fragment encoding 23 residues and containing two repeats of the 9-residue ha epitope (16Field J. Nikawa J.I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. N. Schnell. The FLAG tag (4Brizzard B. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-734PubMed Google Scholar) and the His6 tag (31Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) were produced using PCR and synthetic primers. The GFP gene (5Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5278) Google Scholar) was amplified from the plasmid TU#65 (a gift from Dr. N. Johnsson) using PCR and primers that added appropriate restriction sites for in-frame fusions with UBA2-derived genes (see above). In the constructs containing untagged UBA2, this gene was flanked by its original 3’ sequences, whereas the tagged UBA2 derivatives bore TCYC1, the transcription termination sequence of the CYC1 gene that was transplanted from the plasmid YEp46 (14Ecker D.J. Ishaq Khan M. Marsh J. Butt T.R. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3524-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. D. Finley). The tagged derivatives of UBA1 and the chimeric genes produced by swapping sequences of UBA1 and UBA2 were constructed using PCR-generated fragments of these genes. The final constructs were inserted into the 2μ-based plasmids YEplac181 (LEU2) or YEplac195 (URA3) (21Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527Crossref PubMed Scopus (2465) Google Scholar), using multistep protocols (details available on request). For the expression of His6-Ub (Ub bearing a Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His6-Gly-Ser N-terminal extension) in Escherichia coli, a DNA fragment encoding the Ub ORF was amplified from plasmid YEp46 using PCR and synthetic primers, and cloned as a BamHI-KpnI fragment into pQE-40 (Qiagen), yielding pJD359. To express a His6-tagged Ub (3Beers E.P. Callis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in S. cerevisiae, an EcoRI-KpnI fragment from pJD359 encoding His6-Ub was inserted between PCUP1 and TCYC1 (both from YEp46) in the background of YEplac181 (see above), yielding pJD421. Most of the junctures and tags generated by PCR and synthetic oligonucleotides were verified by sequencing. In the cases where sequence testing was incomplete, biological functions of the constructs were verified using independently produced clones. The S. cerevisiae strain JD62-6A was transformed with either YEplac181 (a vector), pJD389, pJD302, pJD306, or pJD396 that expressed, respectively, no Uba2p, Uba2p-ha, Uba2p-C177A-ha, Uba2p-C177S-ha, or Uba2p-GFP-ha. The cultures were grown in SG medium to A600 of ~1, then diluted 5-fold into SD or SG media containing 50 μM CuSO4, and incubated for 8 h. The cells from 15-ml cultures were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.6 ml of SD or SG media containing 50 μM CuSO4 and 0.1 mCi of Tran35S-label (ICN), and incubated for 10 min at 30°C. The cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 s at 14,000 × g and resuspended in 600 μl of the lysis buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.5) containing also 10 mMN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, chymostatin, and aprotinin (each at 20 μg/ml). 0.5 ml of 0.5-mm glass beads was then added, and the cells were lysed by vortexing in the lysis buffer. The extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with the supernatants (containing approximately equal amounts of CHCl3COOH-precipitable 35S) by adding ascitic fluid (1.5 μl/0.6 ml of supernatant) containing the monoclonal anti-ha antibody 12CA5 (16Field J. Nikawa J.I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) (Babco Inc., Richmond, CA). The samples were incubated on ice for 2 h; 25 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (0.1 g/ml) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was then added, and the suspensions were incubated, with end-over-end rotation, for 1 h at 4°C, followed by a 5-s centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. Pellets were washed four times with 1 ml of the lysis buffer, resuspended in the thioester-preserving electrophoretic sample buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for ~20 s. One-half of each supernatant was left untreated; another half was made 0.25 M in β-mercaptoethanol, followed by incubation at 100°C for 3 min. Both samples were subjected to SDS-8% PAGE and fluorography. 14C-Labeled protein size standards were from Amersham. The strain SUB312 (20Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), which expressed either wild-type (wt) Ub or mycUb from plasmids YEp96 or YEp105, respectively (see above), was transformed with either the vector YEplac195 (21Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527Crossref PubMed Scopus (2465) Google Scholar), its derivative pJD426, or its derivative pJD428, which expressed, respectively, Uba1p-FLAG or Uba2p-FLAG. Cells from exponential cultures (A600 of ~1) of the transformants growing in SD media containing 50 μM CuSO4 were collected by centrifugation, and extracts were prepared as described above. Total protein concentration in an extract was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). An extract containing 50 μg of total protein was added to 40 μl of an agarose affinity gel containing the monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (Eastman Kodak), followed by incubation for 1 h at 4°C, with end-over-end rotation. The anti-FLAG resin was then washed four times with 1 ml of the lysis buffer, and the retained proteins were fractionated by SDS-8% PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Sequential detection of immunoreactive proteins with the anti-FLAG or anti-myc antibodies was carried out using the Amersham ECL detection system. S. cerevisiae SUB312 cells carrying YEp96 (which expressed wt Ub; see above) and either pJD426 or pJD428 (which expressed, respectively, Uba1p-FLAG or Uba2p-FLAG from PCUP1) were grown in SD media. The expression of FLAG-tagged proteins was induced with 50 μM CuSO4 for 6 h before making the extracts, which were prepared as described above except that N-ethylmaleimide was replaced with 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. The FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above from extracts containing 50 μg of total protein. The anti-FLAG resin was washed twice with 1 ml of the lysis buffer and once with 1 ml of 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) (Tris-Mg buffer). The washed resin was resuspended in 50 μl of the thioester assay buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) containing also, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase and ~30 pmol of [35S]methionine-labeled His6-Ub (106 cpm) (see below), and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. The resin was then washed twice with Tris-Mg buffer, and resuspended in electrophoretic sample buffer (see above) containing or lacking 0.25 M β-mercaptoethanol. The former (but not the latter) sample was incubated at 100°C for 3 min before SDS-8% PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie (to verify the presence of approximately equal amounts of FLAG-tagged test proteins), then dried and subjected to autoradiography. The strain SUB312, lacking pUB23 (see above) and expressing His6-Ub from pJD421, was transformed with plasmids pJD426 or pJD428, which expressed, respectively, Uba1p-FLAG or Uba2p-FLAG. Cells grown in 1 liter of SD, 50 μM CuSO4 medium to A600 of ~1 were lysed with glass beads in 20 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.33 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0). The extracts (diluted 4-fold) were adjusted to 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 M NaCl and loaded onto Ni-NTA-Sepharose columns (Qiagen) that bind the His6 tag. The columns were washed with 0.3 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.33 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM imidazole, 2 mM ATP, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0). The Uba1p-FLAG protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 2 mM AMP and 40 μM sodium pyrophosphate instead of ATP. The His6-Ub bound to the resin was subsequently eluted with a low pH buffer (3Beers E.P. Callis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were assayed for the presence of FLAG-tagged proteins by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG antibody. Strain SUB312 carrying plasmids YEp105 and pJD427, and expressing, respectively, mycUb and Uba2p-FLAG-His6, were grown in 1 liter of SD, 0.1 mM CuSO4 medium to A600 of ~0.8. The cells were washed with 0.3 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), and lysed with glass beads in 10 ml of 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.3 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mMN-ethylmaleimide, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), and a set of protease inhibitors as described above. The extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was adjusted to a final concentration of 1 M NaCl, 1 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol in a final volume of 30 ml, and loaded onto a Ni-NTA-Sepharose column (at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min). The column was washed with 30 ml of pH 8 buffer (5% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM imidazole, 1 M NaCl, 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0)), and thereafter with 45 ml of pH 6 buffer (the same as pH 8 buffer but containing 10 mM imidazole and adjusted to pH 6.0 with 1 M NaOH). Uba2p-FLAG-His6 was eluted with pH 3 buffer (the same as pH 8 buffer but adjusted to pH 3 with 1 M HCl). The eluted fractions (12 ml) were adjusted (in a final volume of 25 ml) to 8 M urea, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), and loaded onto a second Ni-NTA-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with the same pH 8-urea buffer. The column was washed with 25 ml of pH-urea buffer followed by elution of Uba2p-FLAG-His6 with pH 6-urea buffer (the same as pH 8-urea buffer but adjusted to pH 6 with 1 M HCl). Proteins in the eluted fractions were assayed for the presence of Uba2p-FLAG-His6 and mycUb by immunoblotting, using the M2 anti-FLAG and 9E10 anti-myc antibodies, respectively.

The enzymatic activity of a CDK is regulated at three different levels: cyclin binding and activation, subunit phosphorylation, and inhibition by a group of heterologous small proteins.

Direct physical interaction between CDK inhibitors and CDK enzymes is necessary for CDK inhibition, but the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. We asked whether CDK inhibitors would affect CDK phosphorylation by CAK. Here, we show that CAK phosphorylation of CDK2 is prevented by the CDK inhibitors, p21 and p27, and that the inhibition of CAK activity by p21 or p27 does not appear to involve a direct interaction between CAK and p21 or p27. In addition, we find that the CDK6-specific inhibitor p18 belonging to the p16 family of CDK inhibitors also blocks CAK phosphorylation of CDK6. Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (NHF) cultivation, serum starvation, and serum stimulation were performed as described in (30Li Y. Jenkins C.W. Nichols M.A. Xiong Y.

Corresponding fragment was PCR-amplified and subcloned into a pQE31 vector (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) as a BamHI-KpnI fragment. Antigenic polypeptide was expressed in bacteria as a hexahistidine-tagged recombinant protein and purified according to Qiagen instruction. Antisera was affinity-purified using bacterially expressed antigenic polypeptide bound to Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). 1 ml of the antibodies was loaded into the column, the column was extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and antibodies were eluted with 1 ml of ActiSep media (Sterogene, Arcadia, CA) and desalted according to manufacturer's instructions. To replace threonine 177 in GST-CDK6 for alanine, the fragment containing two unique sites (SphI and DraIII) was PCR-amplified using forward primer with SphI site: 5ʹ-CGAGGAGGGCATGCCGCTCT-3ʹ and reverse mutagenic oligonucleotide with DraIII restriction site: 5ʹ-GTACCACAGCGTGACGACCACTGAGGCTAGAG-3ʹ.

Cell lysates (100 μg of total protein) prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10Gu Y. Turck C.W. Morgan D.O. Nature. 1993; 366: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-CDK7 antibodies. CAK activation of GST-CDK2 and direct phosphorylation of GST-CDK2 were performed as in (5Poon R.Y. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To test an effect of CDK inhibitors, 1 μg of GST-CDK2 and 1 μg of GST-cyclin A were mixed with p21 or p27 in amounts indicated on the top of the pictures in a total volume of 20 μl in kinase buffer for 30 min on ice. Then 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added, and the reaction mixture was transferred to the tube with immunoprecipitated CAK for 10 min at 23°C, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Direct phosphorylation of GST-CDK6 by CAK was performed by incubation of immunoprecipitated CAK (100 μg of total protein) with 0.5 μg of GST-CDK6, 0.5 μg of GST-cyclin D1, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 40-60 min at 30°C in the kinase buffer. To assay for the activation of CDK6 by CAK, the first step was performed with 1 mM cold ATP as above. Then GST fusion protein with the 137 C-terminal amino acids of Rb (21Guan K.-L. Jenkins C.W. Li Y. Nichols M.A. Wu X. O'Keefe C.L. Matera A.G. Xiong Y. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2939-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) was added together with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for another 20 min at 30°C. To analyze direct effect of CDK inhibitors on CDK2 or CAK (Fig. 1), 100 μg of cell lysates were incubated with indicated amounts of p21 or p27 for 1 h at 4°C. Then CAK or CDK2 were immunoprecipitated, washed two times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer, and activities were measured using GST-CDK2 as a substrate for the anti-CDK7 immunoprecipitates or histone H1 as a substrate for the anti-CDK2 immunoprecipitates. Sequence similarity between CAK catalytic subunit CDK7 and CDKs initially prompted us to ask whether CDK7 could also be regulated by the p21 CDK inhibitor. To address this question, we raised polyclonal antibodies against the bacterially expressed C-terminal portion of human CDK7. This antibody was found not to cross-react with different members of CDK family. The anti-CAK immunoprecipitates possess kinase activity toward GST-CDK2. As reported previously(5Poon R.Y. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 8Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O.

Nature. 1994; 371: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), CDK2 alone without its associated cyclin partner can be readily phosphorylated by CAK, but the cyclin subunit is necessary for the activation of the CDK2 histone H1 kinase activity. Under our conditions the amount of immunoprecipitated CAK was a limiting factor, therefore phosphorylation of histone H1 by GST-CDK2·GST-cyclin A complex always correlated with phosphorylation of GST-CDK2 by CAK (data not shown). To test the potential effect of p21 on CAK activity, we first assessed whether p21 interacts with the catalytic subunit of CAK, CDK7, as is the case for other CDKs. Normal human fibroblasts (NHF) synchronized at different phase of the cell cycle by serum starvation and re-stimulation were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitated with antibody specific to CDK7. This experiment did not reveal the presence of a 21-kDa protein in anti-CDK7 immunoprecipitates. Furthermore, when anti-p21 immunoprecipitates were probed with antibodies against CDK7 we found no detectable CDK7 protein in asynchronously growing fibroblasts. Similarly, when anti-CDK7 immunoprecipates were probed with antibodies against p21, we found no p21 protein in fibroblasts synchronized by serum starvation and restimulation. The same results were also obtained in human lymphocytes stimulated to proliferate by PHA and IL-2 treatment (data not shown). Since it remained possible that the failure to detect the presumptive p21-CAK association may have resulted from low levels of CDK7 expression or from antibody disruption, we tested the potential direct interaction of p21 and CAK by assaying the activity of CAK in presence of high quantities of bacterially expressed p21. In these experiments we also used a related CDK inhibitor p27. When added to NHF cell lysates, purified recombinant p21 and p27 effectively inhibited the histone H1 kinase activity of immunoprecipitated CDK2 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, no inhibition of CAK kinase activity (as assessed by CDK2 phosphorylation) by p21 or p27 was detected (Fig. 1B). Thus, from these data, we believe that neither p21 nor p27 physically interact with CAK. Although p21 and p27 do not appear to interact with CAK directly, it is still possible that the binding of CDK inhibitors with a CDK may render the threonine at position 160 (in CDK2, or 161 in CDC2) inaccessible to the CAK enzyme, thereby preventing the phosphorylation and activation of the CDK. To test this possibility, we assembled the CDK2-cyclin A complex in vitro using bacterially expressed and purified GST-CDK2 and GST-cyclin A and used this complex to determine possible effect of p21 and p27 on CDK2 phosphorylation by CAK. Intriguingly, the addition of the p21 or p27 proteins to the CDK2-cyclin A complex dramatically decreased CDK2 phosphorylation by CAK (Fig. 2, A and B). To further address the specificity of p21 and p27 inhibition of CDK2 phosphorylation by CAK, and to exclude the possibility that this inhibition may be caused by a trace amount of Escherichia coli proteins copurifying with the p21 or p27 proteins, we tested the effect of another newly identified CDK inhibitor, p18, on CDK2 phosphorylation by CAK. p18 is a homolog of p16 that strongly inhibits the activity of CDK6 and weakly inhibits that of CDK4, but exhibits no detectable interaction with four other CDKs including CDK2(21Guan K.-L. Jenkins C.W. Li Y. Nichols M.A. Wu X. O'Keefe C.L. Matera A.G. Xiong Y. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2939-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). When we applied a recombinant p18 protein that was prepared in a manner similar to that for p21 and p27, no inhibition of CDK2 phosphorylation by CAK was detected (Fig. 2C). The same result was obtained when we added bovine serum albumin instead of CDK inhibitors in the reaction (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that inhibition of CDK2 phosphorylation by CAK is dependent on p21/p27 and not on p18. The differences between two families of CDK inhibitors raise an important question of whether the p16 family of CDK inhibitors can also block the CAK phosphorylation on CDK. In order to analyze the effect of the p16/p18 family of inhibitors on CDK phosphorylation by CAK, we first determined whether the bacterially expressed GST-CDK6 protein could be phosphorylated and activated by CAK/CDK7. Unlike CDK2 activation that has been well studied, no data about phosphorylation and activation of CDK6 is available. Fig. 3(top panel) shows that in the absence of immunoprecipitated CAK, no phosphorylation of CDK6 takes place. Some phosphorylation of GST-CDK6 can be detected when the recombinant CDK6 is coincubated with CAK in the absence of cyclin. However, the addition of GST-cyclin D1 enhances CAK phosphorylation of CDK6 and renders the CDK6 enzymatically active in the phosphorylation of the Rb protein (Fig. 3, bottom panel). To prove that CDK6 phosphorylation by CAK occurs at the unique site at threonine at position 177 that is homologous to Thr-160 in CDK2 and Thr-161 in CDC2, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace Thr-177 by Ala. When GST-CDK6 T177A was treated with immunoprecipitated CAK, no phosphorylation of the mutant CDK6 protein (Fig. 3, top panel) or Rb kinase activity (Fig. 3, bottom panel) was detected. These data show that CDK6 is activated through phosphorylation by CAK, and that this phosphorylation is enhanced by cyclin D1. We then tested the CDK6-specific inhibitor p18, a homolog of p16(21Guan K.-L. Jenkins C.W. Li Y. Nichols M.A. Wu X. O'Keefe C.L. Matera A.G. Xiong Y. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2939-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), for its effect on CDK6 phosphorylation by CAK. In our experiment, the p18 protein and GST-cyclin D1 were first mixed, then added to GST-CDK6. After 30 min of incubation, the resultant complex was mixed with immunoprecipitated CAK and assessed for CAK-dependent phosphorylation. Fig. 4(top panel) shows that p18 efficiently blocked the CDK6 phosphorylation by CAK. When recombinant Rb protein was added to the CDK6/p18/cyclin D mixture after CAK activation, no Rb phosphorylation was found (Fig. 4, bottom panel). These data show that, like CDK2, CDK6 activation by CAK is also regulated by p18 CDK inhibitor. Thus, we demonstrate that both families of CDK inhibitors block CDK phosphorylation and activation by CAK and that this block is most likely through the same mechanism: by rendering the CDKs inaccessible to CAK. During the preparation of this manuscript, Kato et al.(7Kato J. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) reported that in mouse macrophages addition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) resulted in growth arrest in mid-G1 phase, where CDK4 exerts its effect on Rb phosphorylation. The study of events that take place after cAMP treatment revealed that induction of the p27 CDK inhibitor blocked the CDK4 activation. Similar to our results, the authors did not find direct interaction of p27 with CAK; thus the inhibition of CDK activation by p27 bound to CDK4-cyclin D1 complex was inferred. Taken together, these data suggest that, in addition to the block of CDK phosphorylation of downstream substrates such as Rb or histone H1, another general mechanism by which CDK inhibitors regulate the cell cycle is by preventing CDK phosphorylation and activation by CAK. We are grateful to Rolf Craven for critical reading of the manuscript and to Aalok Kuthiala and Edward Baptist for help with experiments."

The MDR gene product, called P-glycoprotein, has been shown to hydrolyze ATP in vitro and to mediate ATP-dependent vanadate-sensitive drug efflux when reconstituted in plasma membrane vesicles (20Horio M. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3580-3584Google Scholar). PDR5 was the first yeast ABC transporter shown to hydrolyze ATP in vitro (8Decottignies A. Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Google Scholar), but no biochemical information is presently available for SNQ2 or any other yeast multidrug resistance protein. In S. cerevisiae, a complex genetic network is responsible for the regulation of the PDR phenotype. At least two transcription factors, called PDR1 (3Balzi E. Chen W. Ulawzewski S. Capieaux E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16871-16879Google Scholar) and PDR3 (10Delaveau Th. Jacq C. Perea J. Yeast. 1992; 8: 761-768Google Scholar, 11Delaveau Th. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Google Scholar), have been shown to interact with the PDR5 promoter (21Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mah Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Google Scholar; 9Delahodde A. Delaveau Th. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Quite remarkably, point mutations in PDR1 lead to pleiotropic drug resistance correlated with overexpression of PDR5 mRNA (29Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Google Scholar). Impressive amounts of PDR5 protein were found in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction from the pdr1-3 mutant (2Balzi E. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 151-162Google Scholar; 8Decottignies A. Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Google Scholar). On the other hand, disruption of PDR1 and/or PDR3 leads to hypersensitivity to drugs and decreases the level of PDR5 mRNA (11Delaveau Th. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Google Scholar; 21Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mah Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Google Scholar). Mutations in the PDR7 and PDR9 genes also influence the level of PDR5 transcript (12Dexter D. Moye-Rowley W.S Wu A. Golin J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 505-515Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the level of SNQ2 transcript is controlled by PDR1 and PDR3 and that disruption of SNQ2 affects cell growth. We have located the SNQ2 protein in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction together with PDR5. By selectively deleting or disrupting either the PDR5 or the SNQ2 gene in a pdr1-3 mutant, we were able to distinguish, at the plasma membrane level, the nucleotide triphosphatase activities of the two corresponding proteins independently overexpressed. In a double PDR5,SNQ2 disruptant, the two new ABC transporters PDR11 and YOR1 were detected in the overexpressed 160-kDa protein band of the pdr1-3 mutant. Our set of genetically purified strains was used to solubilize the SNQ2, PDR11, and YOR1 proteins and to separate them from the plasma membrane H+-ATPase PMA1 by centrifugation on sucrose gradients. n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside and Triton X-100 were purchased from Boehringer; ATP, UTP, GTP, CTP, ITP, bovine serum albumin, lysolecithin, o-nitrophenyl β-D-galactopyranoside, cycloheximide, and 4-NQO were from Sigma; erythrosine B and oligomycin were from Janssen Chemica; molecular weight markers (range, 53,000-212,000 Da) were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; nylon membranes (Hybond N+) were purchased from Amersham Corp. Yeast extract was either from KAT or from DIFCO. Asolectin was from Associated Concentrates (Woodside, Long Island, NY). All other reagents were of analytical grade. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. To disrupt PDR5, a 4.7-kb PvuII fragment of plasmid pDR3.3 containing the PDR5 gene (26Leppert G. McDevitt R. Falco S.C. Van Dyk T. Ficke M. Golin J. Genetics. 1990; 125: 13-20Google Scholar) was cut by double digestion with SmaI/SalI to eliminate 1,243 bp of the promoter and 1,390 bp of the PDR5 open reading frame. The remainder was blunt ended by Klenow polymerase treatment, ligated overnight to the URA3 gene isolated by BamHI digestion of the YDp-U vector (5Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.-A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Google Scholar), and blunt ended by Klenow treatment. Escherichia coli strain C600 was transformed as in 18Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Google Scholar. The extracted plasmid, designated as ppdr5:: URA3, was cleaved with BstEII, BglI, and EcoRI to generate the 2,852-bp fragment containing the first 368 bp of the PDR5 promoter, the complete 1,108-bp URA3 gene, and the 1,373-bp SalI-BstEII fragment of the PDR5 open reading frame. The haploid yeast strain US50-18C was then transformed as in Kuo and 23Kuo C.-L. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1730-1737Google Scholar. Transformants (US50-D5) appeared after 3 days at 30°C on a selective uracil-free dropout medium. The chromosomal structure of the disrupted pdr5Δ allele was checked by Southern blotting analysis. The PDR5 null allele obtained was designated as pdr5-Δ3:: URA3 (two other PDR5 null alleles were previously constructed by 21Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mah Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell.

The ura3 auxotrophic marker was recovered by selection on 5-fluoroorotic acid, and disruption of the SNQ2 gene was carried out as follows. The linearized snq2:: Tn10-LUK fragment obtained by XbaI-SalI cleavage of pBS2218 (41Servos J. Haase E. Martin B. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 214-218Google Scholar), kindly provided by M. Brendel and J. Servos (Goethe Universitat, Frankfurt, Germany), was used to transform the yeast strains US50-18C and US50-D5. Disruption of the SNQ2 gene in the strains US50-D2 (SNQ2 disruption in US50-18C strain) and US50-D25 (SNQ2 disruption in US50-D5 strain) was checked by Southern blotting analysis. The strains, grown on standard medium as previously described (46Ulawzewski S. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. & Gen.

A 32-well replicator was used for replica plating, and drug resistance was scored after 3-4 days at 30°C as described by 3Balzi E. Chen W. Ulawzewski S. Capieaux E. Goffeau A. J. Biol.

A 4.7-kb PvuII fragment of plasmid pDR3.3, a 1.0-kb EcoRI fragment of plasmid pBS2218, and a 1.0-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment of plasmid pACT (kind gift of J. Verdi re, Gif-sur-Yvette, France) were used as probes, specific for PDR5, SNQ2, and actin, respectively, after labeling by nick translation with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridizations were carried out for 15 h at 42°C in 40% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 5 × SSPE, and 20 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were washed at 55°C in 1 × SSC, 0.2% SDS and autoradiographed (KODAK x-ray film). For rehybridization, the membranes were immersed once or twice in boiling 0.5% SDS and allowed to cool at room temperature.

The broad 160-kDa band obtained from the plasma membranes of the PDR5-deleted strain US50-D5:pdr1-3,pdr5-Δ3 ::URA3 was excised from an SDS-PAGE gel and electroeluted overnight in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.2% (w/v) SDS. Electroeluted proteins were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g at 4°C. SDS was removed by acetone precipitation as described by 25le Maire M.

After lyophilization, the sample was dissolved in 0.1 M NH4HCO3, 10% (v/v) acetonitrile, pH 8.0, and incubated overnight at 37°C in the presence of 1 μg of trypsin. The digestion product was lyophilized, dissolved in 100 μl of 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and fractionated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (C18; buffer A, 0.06% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid; buffer B, 0.052% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile; gradient: 0-10 min, 5% B, flow rate 0.3 ml/min; 10-10.01 min, 5% B, flow rate 0.3 ml/min; 10.01-90 min, 75% B, flow rate 0.15 ml/min). The peaks, collected manually, were monitored for their OD at 210 mm. A peptide selected from the fractionation was sequenced with an Applied Biosystems sequenator (model 477A) equipped with an on-line amino acid derivative analyzer (model 120A). The amino-terminal sequences of YOR1 and PDR11 were determined as follows. After pre-electrophoresis for 5 h at 50 mA/gel in separating gel buffer containing 0.1 mM thioglycolate, 150 μg of plasma membrane proteins from the US50-D25 strain with deletions in both the PDR5 and SNQ2 genes were separated on an SDS-7% polyacrylamide gel as previously described (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), except that polyacrylamide was replaced with 1% agarose in the stacking gel as described by 31Moos Jr., M.

After electrophoresis at 50 mA, the proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Problott, Applied Biosystems) overnight at 40 V. The 160-kDa Serva blue-stained band was excised with a razor blade and sequenced. US50-D5, US50-D2, and US50-D25 plasma membrane proteins (5 mg/ml) were solubilized with 0.2% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside in the presence of 8 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, as described by 8Decottignies A.

The solubilized proteins (7 mg) were separated on a 33.3-ml linear sucrose gradient containing 6-30% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM ATP, pH 7.5 (AcOH). After centrifugation for 16 h at 76,000 × g in a Beckman type SW28 rotor, the sucrose gradient was divided into 30 1-ml fractions. Nucleotide hydrolysis was measured by incubation of the sample at 30°C in a final volume of 100 μl containing either 6 mM NTP, 7.6 mM MgSO4, 10 mM NaN3 (to inhibit mitochondrial ATPase), and 59 mM MES-NaOH (from pH 5.0 to 7.0) or 6 mM NTP, 7 mM MgSO4, 10 mM NaN3, and 59 mM Tris-HCl (from pH 7.3 to 9.0).

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar after transformation of the yeast with a plasmid bearing an SNQ2 promoter-lacZ gene fusion constructed as follows. 726 bp upstream of the SNQ2 ATG were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and an in-frame BamHI site was placed immediately downstream of this ATG. Primer sequences were as follows: 5’-CGGGATATCCACGGCAAGGAAGTGGCGCG and 3’-GCGGGATCCATTGAATTCTCTTTACGTA. After sequencing, the SNQ2 promoter fragment was inserted as an EcoRV-BamHI fragment into SmaI-BamHI-cleaved lacZ fusion vector pSEYC102. The yeast cells were transformed as in 23Kuo C.-L.

Each value given is the mean ± S.D. of at least 10 trials. The transcriptional control of the PDR5 gene by the PDR1 gene product has been previously demonstrated (29Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Google Scholar; 2Balzi E. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 151-162Google Scholar; 12Dexter D. Moye-Rowley W.S Wu A. Golin J.

Cell. Biol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The PDR3 gene encodes a transcription factor highly homologous but not identical to PDR1 and also controls the expression of the PDR5 gene by binding to the same nucleotide sequence as PDR1 (11Delaveau Th. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Google Scholar; 21Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mah Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Google Scholar). SNQ2 is highly homologous to PDR5; the two protein sequences display 40% identity over their entire length. Several PDR1/PDR3 consensus binding sites are present in the SNQ2 promoter. To test whether transcription of SNQ2 is affected by PDR1 and/or PDR3, Northern blot hybridizations were carried out on total RNA from strains bearing either mutant PDR1 alleles or null PDR1 and/or PDR3 alleles and from the corresponding parental strains. The PDR5 transcript level was also analyzed with a specific probe (Fig. 1). Transcription of both PDR5 and SNQ2 is greatly enhanced in the pdr1-3 (Fig. 1, lane 3) and pdr1-2 (Fig. 1, lane 5) mutant strains, as in the pdr1-6 and pdr1-7 mutants (data not shown). When the gene bearing the point mutation is replaced with a partially deleted PDR1 allele (pdr1-Δ1), both PDR5 and SNQ2 transcript levels decrease drastically (Fig. 1, lane 4 versus lane 3 and lane 6 versus lane 5). As compared to a parental wild type, total deletion of both PDR1 (pdr1-Δ2) and PDR3 (pdr3-Δ1) reduces the levels of both the PDR5 and SNQ2 transcripts, the effect being more marked for PDR5 than for SNQ2 (Fig. 1, lanes 10 versus 7). When only PDR1 or PDR3 is deleted, the PDR5 and SNQ2 transcript levels are but slightly affected (lane 2 versus 1 and lanes 7-9). The regulation of SNQ2 transcription by PDR1 and PDR3 was confirmed by measuring the β-galactosidase activity expressed from an SNQ2 promoter-lacZ fusion (Table 2). The results clearly show the induction of lacZ expression in the pdr1-3 mutant compared to its parental strains as well as the decreased β-galactosidase activity when the mutated allele (pdr1-3 or pdr1-2) is deleted. As compared to a parental wild type, a deletion mutant lacking either PDR1 or PDR3 expresses only slightly less β-galactosidase from the SNQ2 promoter-lacZ fusion gene, while deletion of both genes reduces the β-galactosidase activity by 50%.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Taken together, these results clearly show not only that the pdr1 mutations increase transcription of SNQ2 (and PDR5) but also that the wild-type PDR1 and PDR3 proteins jointly control transcription level of both SNQ2 and PDR5. We used SDS-PAGE to analyze the proteins of the plasma-membrane-enriched fractions isolated from a set of strains, all derived from the drug-resistant pdr1-3 mutant and isogenic but for the deletions/disruptions mentioned (Fig. 2, lanes 4-8). The results are also given for the drug-sensitive parental strains (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). Several components are present in the overexpressed 160-kDa band from the drug-resistant pdr1-3 mutant US50-18C (Fig. 2, lane 4). This band almost completely disappears after deletion of pdr1 in the drug-hypersensitive strain D1-3/3 (46Ulawzewski S. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1987; 207: 38-46Google Scholar; 8Decottignies A. Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Google Scholar). Densitometric quantitation of the pdr1-3 plasma membrane proteins separated by SDS-PAGE revealed that PDR5 and SNQ2 amount, respectively, to 20 and 10% of the total membrane protein, while PMA1 H+-ATPase totals 23%. As previously reported (4Balzi E. Wang M. Leterme S. Van Dyck L. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2206-2214Google Scholar; 8Decottignies A. Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Google Scholar), PDR5 is the major component of the overexpressed 160-kDa band. The intensity of this band is reduced by 66% after deletion of the PDR5 gene in the US50-D5 strain (Fig. 2, lane 6). We detected no SNQ2 amino-terminal sequence in the remaining band, but microsequencing of a tryptic product revealed the(1243)AIASR(1247) sequence belonging to SNQ2. Analysis of the 160-kDa band from the SNQ2 disruptant showed that PDR5 occupies the lower part of the band (Fig. 2, lane 7) and that SNQ2 amounts to 27% of the total protein content of the band from the parental strain US50-18C. When both PDR5 and SNQ2 were disrupted in strain US50-D25, two additional proteins were detected in the band (lane 8). These were shown by microsequencing to contain the amino-terminal sequences SLSKYFNPIP and SITVGDAVXE, respectively, matching those deduced from the PDR11 and YOR1 gene sequences without the initiating methionine. A comparison of the pdr1-3 mutant (lane 8) and the null mutant (lane 5) suggests that levels of both proteins are controlled by PDR1. The growth curves obtained with four of the above-mentioned strains in rich medium (Fig. 3) show that a strain lacking the PDR5 gene reaches a higher cell density than a strain overexpressing PDR5 due to a pdr1-3 mutation (the two strains being isogenic apart from the features just mentioned). The PDR5 protein would thus appear to become toxic when overexpressed, since wild-type PDR1 strains grow better than the pdr1-3 mutant (data not shown). SNQ2 disruption, on the other hand, enhances the lag phase without changing the exponential growth rate. This suggests that the transition from the stationary phase to exponential growth may require the SNQ2 transporter. Double PDR5-SNQ2 disruption alters both the lag and the log phase. Since simultaneous loss of both genes results in slower growth and although neither PDR5 nor SNQ2 is an essential gene, the products of these genes do seem to perform, albeit redundantly, a function or functions that affect growth. PDR5 and SNQ2 are both involved in multidrug resistance (26Leppert G. McDevitt R. Falco S.C. Van Dyk T. Ficke M. Golin J. Genetics. 1990; 125: 13-20Google Scholar; 29Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Google Scholar; 41Servos J. Haase E. Martin B. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 214-218Google Scholar; 2Balzi E. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 151-162Google Scholar; 19Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 285-294Google Scholar; 6Bissinger P.H. Kuchler K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4180-4186Google Scholar), but the resistance spectra associated with these genes are different. Resistance to cycloheximide is PDR5-specific; resistance to 4-NQO is SNQ2-specific; resistance to staurosporine and fluphenazine is attributable to both genes (19Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 285-294Google Scholar). We therefore compared the sensitivities to cycloheximide and 4-NQO of mutant and parental strains (Fig. 4). The SNQ2 disruptants (Fig. 4C, 6 and 7) could not grow on plates containing 4-NQO at 0.5 μg/ml, a concentration which failed to inhibit growth of the PDR1 wild-type strain, the pdr1 mutant, or the deletion mutants lacking PDR1, PDR3, or both (Fig. 4C, 1-5 and 8-23). In contrast, deletion of PDR5 did not affect growth on 4-NQO (Fig. 4C, 5). In the presence of 1.0 μg of 4-NQO/ml, the pdr1 mutant strains could still grow while the corresponding (and otherwise isogenic) strains carrying the wild-type allele or lacking the PDR1 gene grew more slowly or not at all (Fig. 4D, 3/4, 9/8, 10/11, 13/12, 15/14, 18/19). Deletion of PDR1 or PDR3 in a wild-type strain enhanced the sensitivity of the strain to 4-NQO (Fig. 4D, 20-22). Deletion of both PDR1 and PDR3 was even more drastic in this respect (Fig. 4D, 23). These results show that SNQ2-mediated resistance to 4-NQO is under the control of PDR1 and PDR3, thus confirming the results obtained by Northern blot analysis. When PDR5 was disrupted, the disruptant cells failed to grow on plates containing 0.1 μg/ml cycloheximide (Fig. 4E, 5 and 7) while SNQ2 disruption had no effect (Fig. 4E, 5 and 7). The pdr1 deleted strains were more sensitive to cycloheximide than the otherwise isogenic pdr1 mutant strains (Fig. 4E, 4/3, 11/10). Disruption of both PDR1 and PDR3 in a wild-type strain caused cell death on 0.1 μg of cycloheximide/ml (Fig. 4E, 23). These results fully confirm previous data showing that PDR1 and PDR3 jointly control PDR5-mediated resistance to cycloheximide. They also show that SNQ2 has no influence on cycloheximide resistance but mediates resistance to 4-NQO through transcriptional regulation involving both PDR1 and PDR3. To investigate the ATPase activity of SNQ2, we measured this activity at different pH values in plasma membrane preparations from four strains (isogenic but for the features mentioned): the parental pdr1-3 mutant (strain US50-18C), the PDR5-deleted pdr1-3 strain US50-D5 (pdr5-Δ3:: URA3), the SNQ2-disruptant pdr1-3 strain US50-D2 (snq2:: Tn10-LUK), and the double PDR5-SNQ2 knockout pdr1-3 strain US50-D25 (pdr5-Δ3:: URA3, snq2:: Tn10-LUK). The ATPase activities of PDR5 and SNQ2 were estimated by subtracting the ATPase activity of the doubly deleted strain US50-D25 from the activities measured for the single disruptants US50-D5 or US50-D2 or by calculating the loss of activity observed in strains US50-D5 and US50-D2 as compared to their parental strain US50-18C. This enabled us to eliminate the contribution of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase PMA1 and possibly of other ATPases (Fig. 5). The SNQ2 ATPase activity plotted against the pH for strain US50-D5 or US50-18C shows a pH optimum at 6.0-6.5; the activity profile is shifted toward slightly more alkaline pH values than that of the PMA1 H+-ATPase (7Borst-Pauwels G.W.F.H.

The peak is rather sharp, contrasting with the much broader profile obtained for PDR5, in strain US50-D2 or US50-18C. The ATP-hydrolyzing ability of PDR5 indeed remains almost constant from pH 6.0 to 9.0, as already shown by 8Decottignies A. Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Google Scholar. Specific ATPase activities in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction amount to 2.5 μmol Pi•min-1•mg-1 for PDR5 at pH 6.3 and 1.7 μmol Pi•min-1•mg-1 for SNQ2 at pH 6.0 (Fig. 5). Further NTPase activity measurements were carried out at pH 6.3 for both SNQ2 and PDR5. Fig. 6 shows that both PDR5 and SNQ2 hydrolyze magnesium nucleotides at pH 6.3 in the plasma membrane but that the specificity of PDR5 is broader. SNQ2 exhibits a marked “preference” for ATP. Taken together, these results show that despite their high sequence homology, the PDR5 and SNQ2 enzymes have different activity versus pH profiles and different substrate specificities. We have previously shown that oligomycin and erythrosine B inhibit only partially the UTPase activity exhibited by pdr1-3 plasma membranes. In contrast, inhibition by vanadate or Triton X-100 is almost total (8Decottignies A. Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Google Scholar). We show here that oligomycin strongly (I50 = 0.07 μg/ml) and almost totally inhibits the PDR5 UTPase activity at pH 6.3, as reported for P-glycoprotein (39Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Google Scholar; 1Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Google Scholar); it has very little effect, on the other hand, on SNQ2 UTPase activity (Fig. 7A). As for erythrosine B, it reduces the PDR5 UTPase activity by only 20% (Fig. 7B), whereas erythrosine B causes 65% inhibition of SNQ2 UTPase activity at 100 μM and 50% inhibition at 35 μM. Vanadate strongly inhibits, to approximately the same extent, both PDR5- and SNQ2-related UTPase activity, with I50 values around 3-5 μM. Triton X-100 at 1 mM concentration totally inhibits both the SNQ2 and the PDR5 activities, as shown in Fig. 7D. Both enzymes are half-inhibited at 40 μM Triton X-100. This result shows that the H+-ATPase activity does not interfere with the UTPase measurements, since at these concentrations Triton X-100 considerably enhances the H+-ATPase activity instead of inhibiting it (14Goffeau A. Dufour J.-P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 528-533Google Scholar). At a detergent-to-protein ratio of 0.4 (w/v), n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside solubilized the components of the overexpressed 160-kDa protein band obtained from plasma membranes of the pdr1-3 mutant. Solubilization by this detergent led to the loss of 62% of the PDR5 UTPase activity measured at pH 6.3 and 54% of the SNQ2 UTPase activity. The remaining activity was about 20% stimulated by addition of 0.25 mg/ml asolectin to the assay medium. After solubilization with n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside, the plasma membrane proteins from the pdr1-3 strains US50-D5, US50-D2, and US50-D25 were separated on continuous 6-30% sucrose gradients. Fractions 20-23 of each sucrose gradient were found to be enriched in the overexpressed proteins of the 160-kDa band and devoid of the 100-kDa major subunit of PMA1, detected in fractions where the sucrose density exceeded that of fraction 19. Fig. 8 shows the protein content of fraction 22 from each gradient. In the US50-D5 strain gradient fractions, at least two protein bands can be distinguished in the 150-160 kDa range (Fig. 8, lane 2). One of them is SNQ2, since it disappears in the corresponding fractions of the US50-D25 strain (Fig. 8, lane 3). Of the fractions “enriched” in solubilized SNQ2, fraction 21 showed the highest ATPase activity: 0.4 μmol of Pi•min-1•mg-1. Much higher ATPase activity was found in the PDR5-enriched fractions 20-24: 1.7 μmol of Pi•min-1•mg-1. ATPase activities of about 4 μmol of Pi•min-1•mg-1 were found at pH 6.3 in the PMA1-enriched fractions from all strains. SNQ2 has been isolated as a gene conferring hyper-resistance to the mutagens 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and triaziquone when introduced on a multi-copy plasmid (17Haase E. Servos J. Brendel M. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 319-324Google Scholar). It also confers resistance to sulfomethuron methyl and phenanthroline (41Servos J. Haase E. Martin B. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 214-218Google Scholar) as well as to staurosporine and fluphenazine (19Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 285-294Google Scholar). Apart from the observations that it encodes a putative ABC protein (41Servos J. Haase E. Martin B. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 214-218Google Scholar) whose amino acid sequence is 40% identical to that of PDR5 (2Balzi E. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 151-162Google Scholar; 19Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 285-294Google Scholar) and that its transcription is enhanced by heat shock or treatment with a drug such as cycloheximide, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide or fluphenazine (19Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 285-294Google Scholar), nothing is known about the SNQ2 gene nor has the SNQ2 protein been biochemically characterized. Our study establishes three important new facts about SNQ2. First, transcription of the SNQ2 gene is controlled by PDR1 and PDR3 as shown by Northern blot analysis and by expression of an SNQ2 promoter-lacZ fusion gene in a wild-type strain compared to otherwise isogenic pdr1 or pdr3 point or null mutants. This tallies with our observation that mutations in PDR1 enable the mutated strain to grow in the presence of higher concentrations of 4-NQO, while deletion of PDR1 and/or PDR3 renders the strain more sensitive. Second, disruption of the SNQ2 gene in a PDR5/SNQ2-overexpressing pdr1-3 strain markedly lengthens the adaptation phase, during which stationary cells undergo metabolic and physiological changes before starting exponential growth. Yet, the exponential growth rate itself is not affected. In contrast, deletion of PDR5 slightly enhances cell growth as compared to strains overexpressing PDR5. This is in agreement with the suggestion made by 37Romanos M.A. Scorer C.A. Clare J.J. Yeast. 1992; 8: 423-488Google Scholar that overexpressed membrane proteins generally disturb yeast functions. It may also explain why wild-type PDR1 strains grow slightly better than the overexpressing pdr1-3 mutant (data not shown). Disruption of both PDR5 and SNQ2 genes reduces the exponential cell growth rate, showing that the presence of either PDR5 or SNQ2 is important for normal growth. As suggested by 19Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 285-294Google Scholar, these transporters may extrude intracellular cytotoxic metabolites accumulated during growth. Third, the SNQ2 gene product exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase activity. This activity, like that of PDR5, is located in the plasma membrane. The study of the SNQ2 activity was made possible by the development of three key procedures: 1) the use of mutants affected in the transcription factor PDR1, which overexpress SNQ2; 2) the use of mutants where PDR5 and/or SNQ2 is/are disrupted, making it possible to compare enzyme activities in plasma membranes lacking either PDR5, SNQ2, or both; and 3) the use of magnesium nucleotides other than Mg-ATP to measure activities not supported by the H+-ATPase PMA1, previously reported to be very specific for Mg-ATP (7Borst-Pauwels G.W.F.H. Peters P.H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 466: 488-495Google Scholar). We were also able to physically separate SNQ2 or PDR5 from PMA1 by solubilizing the plasma membranes with n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside and centrifuging overnight on sucrose gradients. This procedure, however, reduced the SNQ2 ATPase activity from 1.7 μmol of Pi•min-1•mg-1 in the plasma membrane to 0.4 and the PDR5 ATPase activity from 2.4 to 1.7 μmol of Pi•min-1•mg-1. The purification enabled us, nevertheless, to show that SNQ2 is much more ATP-specific than PDR5; moreover, erythrosine B specifically inhibits the SNQ2-related nucleoside triphosphatase activity and oligomycin the PDR5-related activity. Vanadate and Triton X-100 inhibit both enzymes. Also, the SNQ2 ATPase activity profile peaks sharply at pH 6.0, while PDR5 can hydrolyze ATP from pH 6.0 to 9.0 with approximately constant efficiency. If, as predicted, PDR5 and SNQ2 are “drug efflux pumps,” one might expect a certain substrate specificity for each pump. 19Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 285-294Google Scholar have indeed shown that multiple copies of the SNQ2 gene confer resistance to 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, for instance, but not to cycloheximide, while the opposite is true for the PDR5 gene under the same conditions. Direct proof of this prediction and the study of the mechanism involved require the development of new procedures for reconstituting transport activities either in sealed plasma membrane vesicles or in proteoliposomes containing the purified proteins. It is noteworthy, in this respect, that 33Pawagi A.B. Wang J. Silverman M. Reithmeier R.A.F. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 554-564Google Scholar suggest that the transmembrane distribution of aromatic amino acids in P-glycoprotein may play a functional role in drug specificity. Amino acid sequence analysis of PDR5, SNQ2, and CDR1 (the homolog of PDR5 in Candida albicans, which also confers resistance to cycloheximide (34Prasad R. De Wergifosse P. Goffeau A. Balzi E. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 320-329Google Scholar)) reveals that aromatic residues in transmembrane segments are more highly conserved between PDR5 and CDR1 (75%) than between PDR5 and SNQ2 (50%). Whether this difference in aromatic residue distribution is related to the difference in substrate specificity is a matter of speculation. The putative ATP binding sites of PDR5 and SNQ2 are also interesting; although the GK(S/T) motif is found in the Walker A motifs of all ABC transporters (reviewed by 44Thomas P.J. Pedersen P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 11-19Google Scholar) and although the middle lysine is said to be strictly required for ATPase activity (42Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Google Scholar; 36Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7451-7459Google Scholar; 45Tian G. Yan H. Jiang R.T. Kishi F. Nakazawa A. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4296-4304Google Scholar), this lysine is replaced by a cysteine in the amino-terminal Walker A motif of both PDR5 and SNQ2, both of which nevertheless actively hydrolyze ATP. After disruption of both PDR5 and SNQ2 in the pdr1-3 mutant, at least two additional proteins, identified as PDR11 and YOR1, were found in the 160-kDa overexpressed band. Both are ABC transporters; PDR11 is homologous to SNQ24 4B. Barrell and M. A. Rajandream, personal communication. and yor1 mutants are sensitive to oligomycin.2 These proteins seem to be in relatively low amount in the plasma membrane, as judged by the intensity of Coomassie Blue staining and by the low residual nucleoside triphosphatase activity in plasma membranes isolated from the double deletion mutant lacking both PDR5 and SNQ2. Nevertheless, a further reconstitution study should use preparations genetically purified of PDR11 and YOR1. We gratefully thank M. Brendel and J.

https://openalex.org/W2016770664,"To test the hypothesis that G protein-coupled receptors consist of multiple autonomous folding domains, the rat m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor was “split” in all three intracellular (i1-i3) and all three extracellular loops (o2-o4). The six resulting polypeptide pairs (Ni1•Ci1, No2•Co2, etc.) were coexpressed in COS-7 cells and studied for their ability to bind muscarinic ligands and to activate G proteins. In addition, immunocytochemical and ELISA studies were carried out to study the expression and subcellular localization of the individual receptor fragments.

Coexpression of three of the six polypeptide pairs, generated by splitting the m3 muscarinic receptor in the i2, o3, or i3 loop, resulted in receptor complexes (Ni2•Ci2, No3•Co3, and Ni3•Ci3, respectively), which were able to bind muscarinic agonists and antagonists with high affinity. The No3•Co3 and Ni3•Ci3 polypeptide combinations, but not the Ni2•Ci2 complex, were also able to stimulate carbachol-dependent phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis to a similar maximum extent as the wild type m3 muscarinic receptor.

The structural elements in GPCRs involved in ligand binding and G protein recognition have been mapped in considerable detail (6Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Google Scholar; 23Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Google Scholar; 24Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev.

G protein-coupled receptor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay fetal calf serum inositol monophosphate N-methylscopolamine phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction phosphatidylinositol the seven transmembrane domains of G protein-coupled receptors. We have recently shown that muscarinic receptors (which are typical GPCRs) behave structurally in a fashion analogous to two-subunit receptors (15Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 195-200Google Scholar, 16Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Google Scholar). When truncated m2 or m3 muscarinic receptors (containing TM I-V) were coexpressed in COS-7 cells with their corresponding C-terminal receptor segments (containing TM VI and VII), functional muscarinic receptors were obtained. Similar findings have also been described for “split”β2-adrenergic receptors coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes (11Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we proposed that GPCRs are composed of at least two independent folding domains, one containing TM I-V and the other TM VI and VII (15Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 195-200Google Scholar, 16Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Google Scholar). In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that GPCRs may consist not only of two but of multiple autonomous folding units. To this goal, the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (which was used as a model system) was split in all three intracellular (i1-i3) and all three extracellular loops (o2-o4). The six resulting polypeptide pairs (Ni1•Ci1, No2•Co2, etc.; Fig. 1) were coexpressed in COS-7 cells and studied for their ability to bind muscarinic ligands and to mediate agonist-dependent stimulation of phosphatidyl inositol (PI) hydrolysis (through interaction with G proteins of the Gq/Gll family). In addition, individual receptor fragments were epitope-tagged at their N and C termini, respectively, to allow their subcellular localization to be studied by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and a newly developed, indirect cellular ELISA system. The immunological studies showed that all N- and C-terminal receptor fragments examined (except Ni1; Fig. 1) were inserted into the plasma membrane, even when expressed alone. The results of the coexpression experiments strongly suggest that muscarinic receptors and, most likely, other GPCRs are composed of multiple structural subunits. All mutations were introduced into Rm3pcD, a mammalian expression vector containing the entire coding sequence of the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (2Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Google Scholar), using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis techniques (9Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Google Scholar). To allow the detection of receptor protein in immunological assays, a stretch of nucleotides coding for a nine-amino acid epitope (YPYDVPDYA) (12Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Google Scholar) derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein (HA-epitope) was inserted after the initiating Met codon (yielding Rm3pcD-N-HA) or before the translation stop codon of Rm3pcD (yielding Rm3pcD-C-HA), respectively. For the construction of truncated m3 receptors of the “N series” (Ni1-No4; Fig. 1, Table 1), stop codons (TGA) were inserted at the appropriate positions in Rm3pcD-N-HA. The newly created stop codons were linked to a unique SstI site in the 3′-untranslated region of Rm3pcD-N-HA. For the construction of truncated m3 receptors of the “C series” (Ci1-Co4; Fig. 1, Table 1), PCR primers were designed to contain a PstI site at their 5′-ends (to link the various PCR fragments to the PstI site at position 3154 of the pcD vector), followed by six bases of 5′-untranslated sequence adjacent to the ATG translation initiation codon in Rm3pcD (GTCACA) and an in-frame ATG start codon. For immunological studies, Ci3 and Co3 were epitope-tagged at their C termini by subcloning a 1.31-kilobase pair Rm3pcD-C-HA NheI-SstI restriction fragment containing the HA-epitope into these mutant constructs. The identity of the various constructs and the correctness of all PCR-derived sequences were verified by restriction endonuclease analysis and by dideoxy sequencing of the mutant plasmids.TABLE I Open table in a new tab COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For transfections, 2 × 106 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes. About 24 h later, cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA/dish by a DEAE-dextran method (5Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Google Scholar). For radioligand binding studies, transfected COS-7 cells were harvested 48-72 h after transfections. Binding assays were carried out with membrane homogenates prepared from transfected COS-7 cells essentially as described (7Drje F. Wess J. Lambrecht G. Tacke R. Mutschler E. Brann M.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 256: 727-733Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 3 h at 22°C in a 1-ml volume. Incubation buffer consisted of 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM MgCl2. In N-[3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS, 81.4 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) saturation binding experiments, six different concentrations of the radioligand (range: 6.25-200 pM) were used. In competition binding studies, membrane homogenates were incubated with 200 pM [3H]NMS and 10 different concentrations of cold inhibitor. Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 1 μM atropine. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of 3Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve-fitting procedures, using the computer program LIGAND (saturation binding data; 18Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar) or KALEIDAGRAPH (competition binding data; Synergy Software), respectively. Transfected COS-7 cells were transferred into six-well plates (about 0.75 × 106 cells/well) about 24 h after transfections, and 3 μCi/ml of [myo-3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.) was added to the growth medium. After a 24 h-labeling period, cells were washed once with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated for 20 min (room temperature) with 0.5 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution containing 20 mM HEPES and 10 mM LiCl. Following the addition of different concentrations of carbachol, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After this time, the assay medium was removed, and the reaction was stopped by adding 0.75 ml of 0.1 N NaOH, followed by a 10-min incubation at 37°C. The alkaline solution was then neutralized by adding 0.3 ml of 0.2 M formic acid, and the inositol monophosphate (IP1) fraction was isolated by anion exchange chromatography as described (1Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Google Scholar) and counted on an LKB liquid scintillation counter. An indirect cellular ELISA protocol was developed to quantify the amount of epitope-tagged receptor fragments present in the plasma membrane. One day after transfections, COS-7 cells were transferred into 96-well plates (4-5 × 104 cells/well). About 48 h later, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS and blocking with DMEM containing 10% FCS, cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C with a monoclonal antibody directed against the HA-epitope tag (12CA5, Boehringer Mannheim; 10 μg/ml in DMEM, 10% FCS). Plates were then washed and incubated with a 1:2,500 dilution (in DMEM, 10% FCS) of a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C. H2O2 and o-phenylenediamine (2.5 mM each in 0.1 M phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0) were then added to serve as substrate and chromogen, respectively. The enzymatic reaction (carried out at room temperature) was stopped after 30 min with 1 M H2SO4 solution containing 0.05 M Na2SO3, and the color development was measured bichromatically in the BioKinetics reader (EL 312, Bio Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT) at 490 and 630 nm. One day after transfections, COS-7 cells were transferred into six-well plates (1-2 × 105 cells/well) containing sterilized glass coverslips. About 48 h later, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, unspecific binding was blocked with DMEM containing 10% FCS. Cells were then incubated for 2 h at 37°C with the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (10 μg/ml in DMEM, 10% FCS) or an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (rabbit) raised against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (FHKRVPEQAL) (kindly provided by W. F. Simonds, NIH). After washing off the excess of unbound primary antibody with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with a 1:100 or 1:200 dilution of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma), respectively. The unbound secondary antibody was removed by washing with PBS, and coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using a glycerol/PBS mixture (1:1, v/v). To permeabilize the cell membranes, cells were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (13Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Google Scholar). Images were obtained using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (MRC-600, Bio-Rad). Acetylcholine chloride and carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol) were obtained through Sigma. 4-Diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide was purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA). The rat m3 muscarinic receptor was split in all three intracellular (i1-i3) and all three extracellular loops (o2-o4) by PCR-based mutagenesis techniques (Fig. 1, Table 1). To study the expression and subcellular localization of the resulting individual receptor fragments, a nine-amino acid HA-epitope tag (12Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Google Scholar) was added to the N terminus of all C-terminally truncated receptors (N series, Ni1-No4; Fig. 1). Immunocytochemical studies (confocal fluorescence microcopy) demonstrated that all polypeptides of this series (except Ni1) showed a subcellular distribution similar to that of the wild type m3 muscarinic receptor containing an HA-tag at its N terminus (m3-N-HA). Nonpermeabilized COS-7 cells expressing Ni2, Ni3, No2, No3, or No4 displayed a distinct staining of the plasma membrane indistinguishable from that seen with m3-N-HA (shown for Ni3 in Fig. 2). In contrast, Ni1 was not found in the plasma membrane (no signal in nonpermeabilized cells), but it was retained in the cytoplasm (endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi complex) as visualized with permeabilized cells (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Immunocytochemical localization of m3 muscarinic receptor fragments. COS-7 cells were transfected with DNA constructs coding for Ni1 (a C-terminally truncated m3 muscarinic receptor containing only the first TM domain; Fig. 1) (A and B) and Ci3 (an N-terminally truncated m3 muscarinic receptor containing TM VI and VII; Fig. 1) (C and D). Ni1 contained an HA-epitope tag at its N terminus, whereas Ci3 was used in its nontagged form. Immunofluorescence studies with nonpermeabilized (A and C) and permeabilized cells (B and D) were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the detection of Ci3, an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (FHKRVPEQAL) was employed. Each picture is representative of two or three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Moreover, an HA-epitope was also added to the C terminus of two of the N-terminally truncated receptor fragments, Co3 and Ci3. Immunocytochemical studies with permeabilized COS-7 cells transfected with the epitope-tagged versions of Co3 or Ci3 showed that the two polypeptides could be detected in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi complex, similar to the wild type m3 receptor containing an HA-epitope at its C terminus (m3-C-HA; Fig. 2). However, it could not be determined with certainty whether or not these two fragments were also incorporated into the plasma membrane. Coexpression of Co3 and Ci3 (HA-tagged) with their corresponding N-terminal receptor fragments, No3 and Ni3, respectively (see below), also did not result in a clear staining of the cell surface (studied in permeabilized COS-7 cells). This finding indicated that the sensitivity of the employed immunofluorescence procedure was too low to unambiguously detect the plasma membrane localization of the HA-tagged versions of Co3 and Ci3. We next examined the ability of an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (prepared by W. F. Simonds)2 2W. F. Simonds, unpublished results. raised against a peptide (FHKRVPEQAL) corresponding to the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the rat m3 muscarinic receptor to detect Co3 and Ci3 (nontagged) on the surface of transfected COS-7 cells. In this case, both C-terminal polypeptides could be clearly localized to the plasma membrane (shown for Ci3 in Fig. 3D). The intensity of cell surface staining was not further increased when Co3 and Ci3 were coexpressed with No3 and Ni3, respectively. To quantify the amount of C-terminally truncated receptor fragments (Ni1-No4) present in the plasma membrane, an indirect cellular ELISA protocol was developed (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). The usefulness of this assay system was initially demonstrated by studying nonpermeabilized COS-7 cells transfected with m3-N-HA (a wild type m3 receptor containing an HA-epitope at its N terminus). Control experiments with nonpermeabilized cells transfected with m3-C-HA (a wild type m3 receptor containing an HA-epitope at its C terminus) resulted in optical density readings similarly low as those found with cells expressing the nontagged version of the wild type m3 receptor (data not shown), demonstrating the intactness of the plasma membrane barrier. The m3-N-HA construct was expressed at different receptor densities (Bmax, fmol/mg membrane protein; studied in [3H]NMS saturation binding studies) by stepwise reduction of the amount of transfected plasmid DNA (Fig. 4). In parallel, ELISA experiments were carried out with nonpermeabilized COS-7 cells derived from the same batch of cells used for the Bmax measurements. Fig. 4 shows that the optical density values observed in the ELISA studies were directly proportional to receptor densities (Bmax) determined in the radioligand binding studies. Based on this finding, ELISA experiments were carried out with nonpermeabilized COS-cells individually transfected with receptor fragments of the N series containing an HA-epitope at their N termini (Ni1-No4; Fig. 1). Consistent with the microscopic studies described above, the optical density readings found with Ni1 were not significantly different from background values determined with COS-7 cells expressing the nontagged version of the wild type m3 muscarinic receptor (Table 2). In contrast, transfection of COS-7 cells with all other C-terminally truncated m3 receptor fragments (Ni2, Ni3, No2, No3, and No4) yielded optical density readings that were significantly higher than the background values (Table 2). Assuming a linear relationship between optical density readings and protein amount present in the plasma membrane (Fig. 4), these polypeptides are predicted to be expressed at about 2-10-fold lower levels than the wild type receptor (m3-N-HA).TABLE II Open table in a new tab COS-7 cells individually expressing the various m3 muscarinic receptor fragments were unable to specifically bind the muscarinic antagonist, [3H]NMS. In contrast, a significant number of specific [3H]NMS binding sites (44-122 fmol/mg) could be observed after coexpression of Ni2•Ci2, No3•Co3, or Ni3•Ci3 (Table 3). No specific [3H]NMS binding activity was found after coexpression of the polypeptide pairs Ni1•Ci1, No2•Co2, or No4•Co4, even at very high [3H]NMS concentrations (up to 4 nM).TABLE III Open table in a new tab The results of the [3H]NMS saturation and competition binding studies are summarized in Table 3. Bmax values (determined in [3H]NMS saturation binding assays) after coexpression of Ni2•Ci2, No3•Co3, or Ni3•Ci3 amounted to about 5-20% of the corresponding wild type receptor value when equal amounts of plasmid DNA (4 μg) were used for transfections. The Ni3•Ci3 receptor complex displayed agonist (acetylcholine, carbachol) and antagonist (NMS, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide) binding affinities similar to those of the wild type receptor (Table 3). The Ni2•Ci2 and No3•Co3 polypeptide complexes showed 2.5-8-fold and 4-20-fold reduced affinities, respectively, for all ligands examined. To study whether the various m3 receptor fragments (fragment pairs) were capable of activating G proteins, their ability to mediate carbachol-induced stimulation of PI hydrolysis was examined in transfected COS-7 cells. No functional activity was observed with cells expressing the various polypeptides individually (data not shown). Likewise, only residual PI activity was observed with four of the six fragment pairs examined (Ni1•Ci1, Ni2•Ci2, No2•Co2, and No4•Co4) (Fig. 5). In contrast, the No3•Co3 and Ni3•Ci3 receptor complexes were able to stimulate the production of inositol phosphates to a similar maximum extent as the wild type m3 muscarinic receptor (Fig. 5, Table 4). The PI response mediated by No3•Co3 was characterized by a 5-6-fold reduction in carbachol potency (Fig. 6, Table 4), consistent with the 6-fold decrease in carbachol affinity observed with this polypeptide combination in the radioligand binding studies (Table 3). Surprisingly, carbachol was able to stimulate PI hydrolysis in cells transfected with Ni3•Ci3 with about 60-fold increased potency as compared with cells expressing similar levels of the wild type m3 receptor (m3-N-HA) (Fig. 6, Table 4). In competition binding studies, however, the Ni3•Ci3 complex displayed a carbachol affinity similar to that of the wild type receptor (Table 3).TABLE IV Open table in a new tab Figure 6:Carbachol-induced PI hydrolysis mediated by the No3•Co3 and Ni3•Ci3 polypeptide complexes. COS-7 cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes with epitope-tagged wild type m3 receptor DNA (0.4 μg of m3-N-HA supplemented with 3.6 μg of vector DNA) (○) and mixtures (2 μg of each plasmid) of No3•Co3 (•) or Ni3•Ci3 (▪). m3-N-HA stimulated the generation of inositol phosphates in a fashion similar to the nontagged version of the wild type m3 receptor (data not shown). PI assays were carried out in six-well plates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are presented as percentage increase in IP1 above basal levels in the absence of carbachol. Basal IP1 levels for m3-N-HA amounted to 2236 ± 415 cpm/well. The basal IP1 levels observed in the coexpression experiments were not significantly different from this value. Each curve is representative of three independent experiments, each carried out in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the hypothesis that GPCRs consist of multiple structural subunits (folding units), the rat m3 muscarinic receptor was split in all three intracellular (i1-i3) and all three extracellular loops (o2-o4), thus generating six polypeptide pairs (Ni1•Ci1, No2•Co2, etc.). Initially, COS-7 cells were transfected with the individual receptor fragments to study their expression and subcellular localization. Interestingly, immunocytochemical and ELISA studies showed that all C-terminally truncated receptors except Ni1 were present in the plasma membrane. This finding demonstrates that proper intracellular trafficking and plasma membrane insertion of GPCRs does not require the presence of the full-length receptor protein. In fact, even rather short polypeptides such as No2 and Ni2, which contain only the first two and three TM regions, respectively, are properly targeted to the plasma membrane. In contrast to all other C-terminally truncated receptor fragments (No2-No4), the Ni1 polypeptide, which contains only the first TM domain, could only be detected intracellularly but not on the cell surface. It has been suggested that proper membrane insertion/orientation of eucaryotic plasma membrane proteins critically depends on the character of the 15 amino acids N- and C-terminal of TM I (8Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Google Scholar). Ni1 contains only the first six amino acids of the i1 loop and therefore may not contain the complete structural information required for proper plasma membrane insertion. We found that coexpression of Ni2, No3, and Ni3 with their corresponding C-terminal receptor segments (Ci2, Co3, and Ci3, respectively) resulted in a considerable number (44-122 fmol/mg) of specific [3H]NMS binding sites. This finding suggests that a covalent connection between TM III and TM IV, TM IV and TM V, and TM V and TM VI, respectively, is not essential for the formation of the ligand binding site. However, whereas the Ni3•Ci3 receptor complex displayed wild type-like ligand binding affinities, the Ni2•Ci2 and No3•Co3 polypeptide complexes showed 2.5-20-fold reduced binding affinities for all muscarinic agonists and antagonists examined. This observation suggests that the i2 and o3 loops may exert indirect conformational effects on the proper arrangement of the transmembrane receptor core (formed by TM I-VII) where the binding of small ligands such as acetylcholine is thought to occur (6Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Google Scholar; 23Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Google Scholar; 25Wess J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 308-313Google Scholar; 24Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Google Scholar). To address the question of which fraction of the Ni2•Ci2, Ni3•Ci3, and No3•Co3 fragments is actually associated with each other, we carried out [3H]NMS binding studies with intact COS cells coexpressing these polypeptide pairs. The Bmax values obtained in these experiments (data not shown) were similar to those obtained by the use of crude membrane homogenates (Table 3). Since [3H]NMS is a permanently charged ligand that does not penetrate the plasma membrane, the Bmax values given in Table 3 can be considered a direct measure of the amount of functionally assembled polypeptide complex present on the cell surface. On the other hand, the ELISA experiments provide information about the total amount of the N-terminal receptor fragments (free and complexed) present in the plasma membrane. A comparison of the ELISA data (optical density values can be converted into Bmax values by using the standard curve given in Fig. 4) and the number of “recovered” [3H]NMS binding sites therefore allows to estimate which fraction of Ni2, Ni3, and No3 is complexed with Ci2, Ci3, and Co3, respectively. Based on these considerations, it can be estimated that ~60% of the Ni2 and Ni3 polypeptides and ~15% of No3 (present on the cell surface) exist in a complex with their corresponding C-terminal receptor fragments. Interestingly, immunocytochemical studies with two of the C-terminal receptor fragments, Co3 and Ci3, demonstrated that these polypeptides were delivered to the cell surface, even when expressed alone. The use of a high affinity antibody directed against the C terminus of the rat m3 muscarinic receptor clearly showed that both fragments were localized to the plasma membrane. The immunological studies thus demonstrated that both N- and C-terminal m3 muscarinic receptor fragments can be independently targeted to the cell surface. It is therefore likely that the Ni2•Ci2, No3•Co3, and Ni3•Ci3 polypeptide complexes can be assembled both in the plasma membrane and in the endoplasmic reticulum network. Functional studies showed that the No3•Co3 and Ni3•Ci3 receptor complexes were able to stimulate PI hydrolysis to a similar maximum extent as the wild type m3 muscarinic receptor. Remarkably, the PI response mediated by Ni3•Ci3 was characterized by an approximately 60-fold increase in carbachol potency (compared with the wild type receptor). Since this polypeptide complex was shown to bind carbachol with wild type-like affinity, this observation suggests that the Ni3•Ci3 complex can activate G proteins with increased efficiency. Interestingly, a 115-amino acid segment of the i3 loop of the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (Glu273-Asn387) was not included in either Ni3 or Co3 but was deleted during the construction of the two gene fragments. The possibility therefore exists that this segment of the i3 loop contains structural elements (e.g. potential phosphorylation sites important for receptor desensitization) that exert a negative regulatory effect on receptor-G protein coupling. The correctness of this hypothesis will be studied in coexpression experiments using modified versions of Ni3 including this portion of the i3 loop (Glu273-Asn387). In contrast to No3•Co3 and Ni3•Ci3, the Ni2•Ci2 peptide complex, despite its ability to bind muscarinic ligands with relatively high affinity, was unable to stimulate PI hydrolysis to a significant extent. Consistent with previous findings that the i2 loop of GPCRs plays an important role in proper G protein recognition and activation (26Wong S.K.-F. Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6219-6224Google Scholar; 6Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Google Scholar; 23Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Google Scholar; 17Moro O. Lameh J. Hgger P. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22273-22276Google Scholar), this observation suggests that the intactness of the i2 loop is essential for efficient receptor-G protein coupling. In contrast to Ni2•Ci2, No3•Co3, and Ni3•Ci3, coexpression of the Ni1•Ci1, No2•Co2, and No4•Co4 polypeptide combinations did not result in significant ligand binding activity. The lack of functional activity found with Ni1•Ci1 can be explained by the observation that Ni1 is not inserted into the plasma membrane (see above). On the other hand, the inability of the No2•Co2 and No4•Co4 polypeptide combinations to produce functional receptors remains unknown at present. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that muscarinic receptors and, most likely, other GPCRs are composed of multiple structural/functional subunits. These subunits appear to be able to fold independently of each other in a fashion such that they can interact with each other to form a functional receptor complex. The findings described here obtained with a eucaryotic plasma membrane protein are consistent with previous studies on a structurally related bacterial membrane protein, bacteriorhodopsin, which, however, does not couple to G proteins but functions as a light-driven proton pump (for a review, see 19Popot J.-L. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4031-4037Google Scholar). While the present study was carried out in an in vivo system, all studies on the microassembly of bacteriorhodopsin were performed in vitro under conditions clearly different from those found in an intact cell. It could be shown that bacteriorhodopsin can be functionally reconstituted from individual receptor fragments resulting from proteolytic cleavage of various loop regions (14Liao M.-J. London E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9949-9955Google Scholar; 20Popot J.-L. Gerchman S.-E. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 655-676Google Scholar, 10Kahn T.W. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6144-6151Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings support the notion that the folding of both procaryotic and eucaryotic membrane proteins occurs in two consecutive steps (19Popot J.-L. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4031-4037Google Scholar). In step I, the individual transmembrane helices are established across the lipid bilayer. The helices can then, in step II, interact with each other to form a functional protein complex. It should be mentioned that truncated versions of GPCRs have also been shown to be of clinical relevance. Nonsense or frameshift mutations in the V2 vasopressin receptor gene, for example, which lead to truncations of the receptor protein in various intracellular and extracellular loops, can be the cause of X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (21Raymond J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F163-F174Google Scholar). Moreover, a nonsense mutation within the rhodopsin gene leading to a translational stop site in the i3 loop has been shown to give rise to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, a common hereditary form of retinal degeneration (22Rosenfeld P.J. Cowley G.S. McGee T.L. Sandberg M.A. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nature Genet. 1992; 1: 85-91Google Scholar). Based on the results presented in this study, one may speculate that such clinically relevant mutant receptors represent targets for novel therapeutic strategies (e.g. peptide or gene therapy) designed to rescue the function of these mutant proteins. In conclusion, we could demonstrate under in vivo conditions that GPCRs are composed of multiple structural subunits. Our findings should be of general relevance for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane insertion, assembly, and intracellular trafficking of eucaryotic plasma membrane proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1539647070,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) and thyroid hormone receptors (TR) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which regulate lipid metabolism and tissue differentiation. In order to bind to DNA and activate transcription, PPAR requires the formation of heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). In addition to activating transcription through its own response elements, PPAR is able to selectively down-regulate the transcriptional activity of TR, but not vitamin D receptor. The molecular basis of this functional interaction has not been fully elucidated. By means of site-directed mutagenesis of hPPARα we mapped its inhibitory action on TR to a leucine zipper-like motif in the ligand binding domain of PPAR, which is highly conserved among all subtypes of this receptor and mediates heterodimerization with RXR. Replacement of a single leucine by arginine at position 433 of hPPARα (L433R) abolished heterodimerization of PPAR with RXR and consequently its trans-activating capacity. However, a similar mutation of a leucine residue to arginine at position 422 showed no alteration of heterodimerization, DNA binding, or transcriptional activation. The dimerization deficient mutant L433R was no longer able to inhibit TR action, demonstrating that the selective inhibitory effect of PPAR results from the competition for RXR as well as possibly for other TR-auxiliary proteins. In contrast, abolition of DNA binding by a mutation in the P-box of PPAR (C122S) did not eliminate the inhibition of TR trans-activation, indicating that competition for DNA binding is not involved. Additionally, no evidence for the formation of PPAR:TR heterodimers was found in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In summary, we have demonstrated that PPAR selectively inhibits the transcriptional activity of TRs by competition for RXR and possibly non-RXR TR-auxiliary proteins. In contrast, this functional interaction is independent of the formation of PPAR:TR heterodimers or competition for DNA binding.

Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 149-153Google Scholar). Their closest relatives in the superfamily are the type II nuclear hormone receptors, such as the retinoic acid, vitamin D, and thyroid hormone receptors. In particular, the P-box of the first zinc-finger responsible for DNA-binding specificity is fully conserved between hPPARα and the L-triiodothyronine (T3)-receptors (TR) α1 and β1 (Fig. 1A), reflecting the preferential binding of both receptors to differently spaced AGGTCA half-sites(2Krey G. Keller H. Mahfoudi A. Medin J. Ozato K. Dreyer C. Wahli W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 47: 65-73Google Scholar). Additionally, a high degree of sequence conservation is found between a putative leucine zipper motif in the ligand-binding domain of PPARα and TR(3Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Google Scholar). This motif is very highly conserved among various species and PPAR subtypes (Fig. 1B). Besides the structural homology, TRs and PPARs require heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) for optimal DNA binding and both receptors are co-expressed in brain, liver, and adipocytes, where they are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism(1Green S. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 149-153Google Scholar). We and others have recently reported that the PPARα is able to modulate TR activity either positively or negatively, depending on the T3-response element (TRE)(4Bogazzi F. Hudson L.D. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11683-11686Google Scholar, 5Meier-Heusler S.C. Zhu X. Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Burger A.G. Cheng S.Y. Meier C.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 107: 55-66Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that rTRα is able to form heterodimers with rPPARα in solution, it has not been demonstrated whether this interaction quantitatively accounts for the observed transcriptional changes. Here we examined the mechanism by which hPPARα structurally and functionally interacts with TR and RXR. We show that hPPARα is an efficient competitor for RXR and most likely for other TR-auxiliary proteins (TRAPs), thereby specifically inhibiting TR activity by disrupting the formation of TR:RXR heterodimers. A series of point mutations in hPPARα allowed the mapping of a region that is indispensable for this cross-talk to a carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper-like motif, which is highly conserved among all subtypes (PPARα, β, γ, and δ) of this receptor. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor L-triiodothyronine T3 receptor retinoid X receptor T3-response element TR-auxiliary proteins peroxisome proliferator-activator response element bifunctional enzyme vitamin D receptor 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor L-triiodothyronine T3 receptor retinoid X receptor T3-response element TR-auxiliary proteins peroxisome proliferator-activator response element bifunctional enzyme vitamin D receptor 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid.

Mutant hPPARα (pSG5-hPPARα-L433R and -L422R) were created by the polymerase chain reaction-mediated splice donor site overlap extension method and by subsequently replacing the HindIII/XbaI fragment of pSG5-hPPARα with the mutated polymerase chain reaction product(10Meier C.A.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-TRβ1 antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the unique hTRβ1 amino acid sequence 61-81 as described by Falcone et al.(11Falcone M. Miyamoto T. Fierrorenoy F. Macchia E. DeGroot L.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2419-2429Google Scholar). The peptide was coupled to the maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) for immunization. Fifty μg of protein was injected with Specol (Central Veterinary Institute, Lelystad, the Netherlands). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated hTRα1, hTRα2, and hTRβ1 as already described(12Schwartz H.L. Strait K.A. Ling N.C. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11794-11799Google Scholar). To prepare an anti-PPAR antibody the cDNA encoding the 101 first amino acids of the mouse PPARα were cloned into the pQE-9 bacterial expression vector. The expressed polypeptide was purified on a Ni-NTA-agarose column under native conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany), and injected subcutaneously into KOBU rabbits. After the primary injection (200 μg of polypeptide with Freund's adjuvant), the rabbits were boosted 4 times (200 μg/boost). The serum was collected 10 days after the final boost. [35S]Methionine-labeled and unlabeled receptors were synthesized using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation kit TnT/T7 (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled receptors were analyzed for appropriate size by electrophoresis on a 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and quantitated by the trichloroacetic acid precipitation method as described(10Meier C.A. Parkison C. Chen A. Ashizawa K. Meier-Heusler S.C. Muchmore P. Cheng S.Y. Weintraub B.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1986-1993Google Scholar). In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled and unlabeled receptors were brought to a final volume of 20 μl with EMSA binding buffer and incubated with the appropriate rabbit polyclonal antibodies or preimmune sera overnight at 4°C. Complexes were precipitated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose (slurry 50%) (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) previously washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Tween 20, 0.5 mM methionine, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with regular shaking. After microcentrifugation the pellet was washed 4 times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Tween 20 and 0.5 mM methionine. 50 μl of SDS-PAGE denaturing sample buffer was added to the final pellet and boiled for 5 min at 94°C. The supernatant was subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. Single stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland) and annealed with the complementary strands. The following sequences were used(7Bardot O. Aldridge T.C.

The ends were filled in using Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham, United Kingdom). In vitro translated receptors were incubated with 20,000 cpm of the labeled double stranded oligonucleotides in the presence of 2 μg of poly[d(I-C)] and EMSA binding buffer (50 mM KCl, 20 mM Hepes, 20% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) added to a final volume of 25 μl. Incubation was performed at room temperature for 20 min and the mixture was then loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The electrophoresis was performed at 4°C and 300 V for 80 min. HepG2 cells were plated 24 h before transfection in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) hormone-depleted fetal calf serum(13Flug F. Copp R.P. Casanova J. Horowitz Z.D. Janocko L. Plotnick M. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6373-6382Google Scholar), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml) in 6-well plates at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/well. The medium was changed 4 h before transfection. Using the calcium-phosphate method (CellPhect kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ) the cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids. Eighteen hours later the plates were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium was added together with 500 nM of either L-triiodothyronine, the peroxisome proliferator, and arachidonic acid analogue ETYA or 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D (VD). After another 24 h the cells were harvested, lysed, and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity determined in the extract as described(14Steinfelder H.J. Hauser P. Nakayama Y. Radovick S. McClaskey J.H. Taylor T. Weintraub B.D. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3130-3134Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was normalized for the protein concentration as measured by the Coomassie Blue method. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated two to four times. We have previously reported an inhibitory effect of hPPARα on hTRs in HeLa cells(5Meier-Heusler S.C. Zhu X. Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Burger A.G. Cheng S.Y. Meier C.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 107: 55-66Google Scholar). In contrast to the dominant negative effect of mutant hTRβ1 from kindreds with thyroid hormone resistance, this effect was observed on all types of TREs, i.e. palindromic, inverted palindromic, and direct repeat arrangements of the half-sites. The present experiments were performed in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 representing a tissue of high expression of both TR and PPAR(15Lemberger T. Staels B. Saladin R. Desvergne B. Auwerx J. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24527-24530Google Scholar, 16Falcone M. Miyamoto T. Fierrorenoy F. Macchia E. DeGroot L.J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 130: 97-106Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the dose dependent inhibition by PPAR of ligand-dependent transcription of hTRβ1 when assessed on a TRE-LAP. Similar results were obtained on reporters containing a DR+4 or TRE-PAL (data not shown). However, this inhibitory effect of hPPARα was specific for hTR, since no alteration of vitamin D-dependent transactivation was observed on a DR+3 element in the presence of increasing doses of hPPARα (Fig. 2B). Similarly, no change in the transcriptional activity of hTRβ1 on a TRE-LAP was present when increasing amounts of VDR were transfected (Fig. 2C). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments of [35S]methionine-labeled hPPARα with unlabeled hTRβ1 in the presence of an anti-hTRβ1 antibody did not show evidence for the formation of relevant quantities of PPAR:TR heterodimers in solution (Fig. 3A, lane 3). However, the precipitation of 35S-labeled hRXRα after incubation with cold hTRβ1 demonstrates the ability of the anti-hTRβ1 antibody to precipitate hTRβ1 also in its heterodimerized state. Similarly, when using an anti-PPAR antiserum together with [35S]methionine-labeled hTRβ1 and cold hPPARα, no PPAR:TR heterodimers were detected (Fig. 4A, lane 9). In order to test for inhibitory mechanisms other than the formation of TR:PPAR heterodimers which we were unable to detect, we performed EMSA on a radiolabeled TRE-LAP (Fig. 3B). The addition of a 1-4-fold excess of hPPARα did not inhibit the formation and DNA binding of hTRβ1 homodimers, compatible with the lack of formation of TR:PPAR heterodimers (Fig. 3B, lanes 2-5). However, hPPARα was able to substantially reduce the formation of TR:RXR heterodimers already at equimolar receptor concentrations, suggesting that hPPARα competes with high affinity for this TRAP (lane 7). At excess amounts of hPPARα, the TR:RXR complex was almost completely abolished, and the reappearance of TR:TR homodimers could be observed (lanes 8 and 9). This suggests that PPAR competes for RXR, rather than for DNA binding. However, for reasons that have not been further investigated, the intensity of the homodimeric band in lane 9 does not equal that observed in the absence of PPAR and RXR in lane 2. It is nevertheless likely that the still visible DNA-bound TR:RXR complex as well as possibly unbound TR:RXR heterodimers sufficiently lower the free TRβ1 concentration to reduce the cooperative formation of homodimers. The dimeric nature of the TRβ1 complexes on this element was established previously by our and other groups(5Meier-Heusler S.C. Zhu X. Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Burger A.G. Cheng S.Y. Meier C.A. Mol.

The composition of the homo- and heterodimeric complexes of hTRβ1 on TRE-LAP was confirmed by quantitatively supershifting both bands with the anti-TRβ1 antiserum (data not shown).Figure 4:Leucine residue 433 of hPPARα mediates the interaction with hRXRα. A, interaction of wild-type and mutant hPPARα with hRXRα assessed by co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-PPAR antibody. While the hPPARα wild-type (lanes 1 and 2), -C122S (lanes 5 and 6), and L422R (lanes 7 and 8) were able to form heterodimers with RXR, the L433R mutant completely lost its ability to interact with RXR (lanes 3 and 4). Lane 9 confirms the absence of PPAR:TR heterodimers with an anti-PPAR antibody when [35S]methionine-labeled hTRβ1 (hTRβ1*) was used instead of hRXRα. 4 fmol of [35S]methionine-labeled hRXRα (hRXRα*) are incubated with 6 fmol of in vitro translated wild-type or mutated PPARs (lanes 1-8) and 2 ml anti-PPAR antiserum (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9). When no antiserum was added, volume is replaced by preimmune serum (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). Immune complexes were precipitated by protein A-agarose and electrophoresed. B, binding of wild-type and mutant hPPARα to the PPRE from BFE in EMSA. In the absence of RXR, neither the wild-type nor mutant PPARs were able to bind to DNA (lanes 3-6). Upon addition of RXR, PPAR wild-type and the control mutant L422R were capable of interacting with the BFE element (lanes 7 and 9), whereas the heptad repeat (L433R, lane 8) and P-box (C122S, lane 10) mutants showed no detectable binding. In all incubation mixtures, the total volume of reticulocyte lysate was kept constant and completed with unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate where necessary.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to test directly whether hPPARα competes for RXR, rather than for DNA binding, three mutant hPPARα were created as illustrated in Fig. 1. Mutation C122S is located in the P-box at the base of the first zinc-finger (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequence alignment of the ligand-binding domains of hTRβ1 and hPPARα revealed the presence of a highly conserved leucine zipper-like heptad repeat, corresponding to the ninth heptad repeat in hTRβ1 (Fig. 1B)(3Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Google Scholar, 19Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15766-15771Google Scholar). In order to test its function in the context of hPPARα, the distal leucine was mutated to an arginine (L433R). To exclude a nonspecific effect of this mutation on the secondary or tertiary protein structure of PPAR, a control mutation was created 11 amino acids amino-terminally (L422R). The three hPPARα mutants were characterized with respect to their ability to interact with RXR in solution, to bind to DNA, and to transactivate through a PPRE and to modulate TR activity. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with the anti-PPAR antibody detected the presence of PPAR:RXR heterodimers in solution when hPPARα-wild-type, or the -C122S and -L422R mutants where used. In contrast, the Leu to Arg mutation at position 433 abolished the heterodimerization with hRXRα (Fig. 4A). In addition, like the wild-type hPPARα, none of the mutants was able to heterodimerize with hTRβ1 (Fig. 3A). When analyzed in an EMSA using the PPRE from the BFE promoter, no binding to DNA was observed when wild-type or mutant hPPARα was used alone (Fig. 4B, lanes 3-6). However, only the wild-type and hPPARα-L422R mutant bound to DNA when RXR was present (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 9). The hPPARα-C122S was expected to be unable to bind to DNA due to its mutation in the DNA-binding domain (lane 10), while the hPPARα-L433R was incapable of interacting with DNA due to its defect in heterodimerizing with RXR (lane 8). Taken together, these results suggest that the distal leucine residue 433 of the minimal leucine zipper motif in the ligand-binding domain of PPAR is required for the heterodimerization with RXR, while the cysteine residue 122 in the P-box is necessary for binding to DNA without affecting the heterodimerization with RXR. The control mutation hPPARα-L422R close to this putative leucine zipper heptad repeat altered neither the formation of heterodimers nor DNA binding. The panel of mutant hPPARα was tested in a transient transfection system for the capacity to transactivate as well as to modulate TR activity. When tested on the PPRE from the BFE promoter, only wild-type hPPARα and L422R showed ligand-induced transcriptional activity, as anticipated from the EMSA experiments (Fig. 5). The inhibitory effect of hPPARα-L433R and -C122S in the presence of ETYA on the basal activity of the reporter gene was not further analyzed here. In order to test the ability of the mutant PPARs to inhibit ligand-induced TR transactivation, co-transfection experiments with hTRβ1 and mutant hPPARα were performed as shown in Fig. 6, A-C. While the leucine zipper mutant hPPARα-L433R lost its ability to down-regulate TR activity (Fig. 6A), the DNA binding-deficient mutant hPPARα-C122S (Fig. 6B) and the control mutant hPPARα-L422R (Fig. 6C) remained efficient inhibitors of TR-dependent transcription. These data demonstrate that the leucine residue at position 433 of hPPARα is essential for mediating cross-talk with hTR by a mechanism involving heterodimerization with RXR. Besides sharing structural homologies, and the ability to heterodimerize with RXR, TR and PPAR are both involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. We now show that PPAR is able to selectively inhibit ligand-induced TR activity by competing for TRAPs, particularly RXR. In addition, our data suggest that a highly conserved leucine zipper-like heptad repeat in the ligand-binding domain may be required for PPAR to dimerize with RXR. However, despite a similar control mutation located 11 amino acids amino-terminally (L422R), the possibility of protein misfolding in the mutation L433R cannot be completely excluded. Nevertheless, immunocytochemical studies of transfected HepG2 cells show that all the PPAR mutants are expressed similarly to the wild-type protein (data not shown). Other mechanisms possibly accounting for the modulatory action of PPAR on TR, such as the formation of PPAR:TR heterodimers and/or the competition for DNA binding, were also addressed in the present study. In contrast to what has been reported for rTR and rPPARα(4Bogazzi F. Hudson L.D. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11683-11686Google Scholar), we found no evidence for the formation of significant amounts of hPPARα:hTRβ1 heterodimers. While the formation of PPAR:TR heterodimers may exist, it is not likely to be quantitatively important as is already evident from the initial report. The present results obtained with the P-box mutant C122S show that competition for DNA binding is also not a major mechanism for the inhibition of TR action by PPAR. Nevertheless, the hPPARα-C122S was a somewhat less efficient inhibitor of thyroid hormone action, although its dimerization with RXR was preserved and binding to a TRE-LAP has been excluded by gel shift assays. This characteristic of the mutant has not been analyzed further, but possible explanations are differences in expression levels, post-translational modifications, or heterodimer stability. The modulation of TR transactivation by PPAR is highly specific, since the ligand-dependent VDR activity was not altered by PPAR. However, since the transcriptional activity of VDR depends also on RXR on the vitamin D-response element used, PPAR would be expected to also inhibit the formation of VDR:RXR heterodimers, unless VDR has a higher affinity for RXR than PPAR. Indeed, our EMSA data suggest that PPAR also decreases the binding of VDR:RXR heterodimers to DNA, but to a lesser extent than TR:RXR heterodimers (data not shown). This together with the observation that the transfection of excess amounts of RXR does not restore full TR activity in the presence of PPAR argues in favor of PPAR competing and dimerizing with as yet uncharacterized non-RXR TRAPs(5Meier-Heusler S.C. Zhu X. Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Burger A.G. Cheng S.Y. Meier C.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 107: 55-66Google Scholar). However, this putative TRAP is expected to interact with PPAR by means of a similar dimerization region as RXR, since hPPARα-L433R eliminates the inhibitory effect of PPAR on TR. A modulatory effect of PPAR on thyroid hormone signaling in cell cultures has been recently reported(20Yamada J. Sugiyama H. Tamura H. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 555-557Google Scholar), suggesting a physiological importance for this mechanism. In humans, the syndrome of thyroid hormone resistance, which is due to dominant negative mutations in one hTRβ1 allele, also clearly demonstrates the ability of a nuclear factor to modulate thyroid hormone action in a dominant negative manner in vivo and in vitro(21Refetoff S. Weiss R.E. Usala S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 348-399Google Scholar). In addition, TRs and PPARs are co-expressed in many tissues, such as liver and brain, and both receptors regulate similar metabolic steps in lipid metabolism, such as the ones controlled by malic enzyme and bifunctional enzyme. The modulatory effect of PPAR on TR depends on the PPAR protein levels as well as its affinity for RXR, the former being controlled by glucocorticoids and the latter possibly by phosphorylation as demonstrated for other nuclear receptors(15Lemberger T. Staels B. Saladin R. Desvergne B. Auwerx J. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24527-24530Google Scholar). In summary, we have demonstrated that PPAR is able to selectively inhibit the transcriptional activity of TRs by competing for RXR and possibly also for a specific, but as yet unidentified non-RXR TRAP. In addition, the results suggest that a highly conserved leucine zipper-like motif in the ligand-binding domain of PPAR may be necessary, although not be sufficient, for PPAR to dimerize with RXR.

https://openalex.org/W2007595662,"We have isolated the promoter of the rat C/EBPα gene and find a high degree of homology with the mouse gene, particularly in putative regulatory domains. Transactivation of this promoter by ectopic expression of rat C/EBPβ occurs through a C/EBP regulatory domain at position −170 to −195. An oligonucleotide corresponding to this domain binds to complexes expressed in rat liver that comprise C/EBPα-C/EBPβ heterodimers (αβ) as well as C/EBPβ complexed with itself and/or other unidentified nuclear factors (β1, β2, and β3). The DNA binding activity of these complexes changes both qualitatively and quantitatively following partial hepatectomy. Within 2-5 h postsurgery, the binding activity of the αβ complexes drops severalfold, reaching a nadir by 20 h. During the ensuing 3-8 days, as regeneration nears completion, this activity slowly returns to normal quiescent liver levels. Western blot analysis shows 3 major C/EBPα polypeptide species (42, 40, and 30 kDa), whose abundance in general parallels the decrease and recovery in DNA binding activity. In contrast to C/EBPα behavior, the DNA binding activity of the β complexes is transiently induced severalfold during the early G1 period between 2 and 6 h posthepatectomy. The major C/EBPβ polypeptide is the 32-kDa LAP protein, whereas the LIP protein (21 kDa) is weakly expressed. Both remain essentially constant throughout the course of regeneration, suggesting that changes in DNA binding activity may reflect changes in the complexed proteins rather than the C/EBPβ polypeptides themselves. In primary hepatocyte cultures, under growth supporting conditions, in the absence of growth factors proliferation is negligible; C/EBPα is abundantly expressed at the outset, but is then extensively down-regulated. Epidermal growth factor causes further decay of C/EBPα polypeptides and DNA binding activity, and down-regulates C/EBPβ DNA binding activity as well. Addition of transforming growth factor β completely antagonizes the effects of epidermal growth factor on C/EBPβ activity, and partially overcomes the effect on C/EBPα. These results demonstrate that the DNA binding activity of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ complexes is regulated in the regenerating liver, and in hepatocyte cultures responding to growth factors that regulate their proliferation. We have isolated the promoter of the rat C/EBPα gene and find a high degree of homology with the mouse gene, particularly in putative regulatory domains. Transactivation of this promoter by ectopic expression of rat C/EBPβ occurs through a C/EBP regulatory domain at position −170 to −195.

These results demonstrate that the DNA binding activity of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ complexes is regulated in the regenerating liver, and in hepatocyte cultures responding to growth factors that regulate their proliferation. During development, acquisition of the differentiated phenotype involves expression of function-specific genes along with entry of the cells into a quiescent phase of the cell cycle. Maintenance of this state not only requires continual activation of the differentiation program, but suppression of various growth related processes. In this regard, investigators have proposed that the protein products of certain function-specific genes also inhibit cell proliferation(1Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Google Scholar, 2Sorrentino V. Pepperkok R. Davis R.L. Ansorge W. Philipson L. Nature. 1990; 345: 813-815Google Scholar, 3Crescenzi M. Fleming T.P. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8442-8446Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms controlling this balance between growth and differentiation, we are studying the proliferation of hepatocytes in the regenerating liver and in culture. The liver is a highly specialized organ composed primarily of hepatocytes which are normally in a state of growth arrest (G0), expressing an array of differentiated functions that are crucial to the overall physiology of the organism. Although growth and differentiation are considered mutually exclusive, the hepatocytes can be induced to proliferate by a metabolic overload imposed by the body, which, for experimental purposes, is most readily initiated by a partial hepatectomy(4Bucher N.L.R. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1991; 6: 615-624Google Scholar, 5Fausto N. Zakin D. Berger T.D. Hepatology. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., London1989: 49-65Google Scholar, 6Michalopoulos G.K. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 176-187Google Scholar). This procedure involves excision of the two large lobes of the liver in the rat (68% of the whole organ), which induces the proliferation of the remaining cells in the two small lobes. The excised lobes are not restored. Within the remnant, the hepatocytes are activated first, moving rapidly out of the G0 into G1 phase and progressing into S phase at 14-16 h posthepatectomy. The peak of DNA synthesis occurs approximately 8 h later and by 24-36 h most of the hepatocyte population has undergone at least one cell division. It is at this stage that the non-parenchymal cells start to proliferate while some of the hepatocytes enter a second cell cycle. Growth of all the cells continues throughout the liver remnant, preserving the histological architecture, until the original mass of the liver is restored within 9-12 days. While this growth process is occurring, the regenerating liver is still capable of performing its normal physiological functions by maintaining (7Friedman J.M. Chung E.Y. Darnell J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 37-53Google Scholar) and, in some cases, inducing the expression of liver-specific genes (8Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Melby A.E. Taub R. J. Biol.

The four C/EBP proteins, α, β, γ, and δ, are members of a diverse group of nuclear factors that contain a leucine zipper domain required for dimer formation and a basic DNA binding domain which binds to the regulatory domains of promoters and/or enhancers of target genes (10Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar, 11Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Google Scholar). Expression of the C/EBP genes is regulated in such a way that three of the proteins (α, β, and δ) are restricted to a limited number of tissues (10Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar) while C/EBPγ (Ig/EBP) appears to be ubiquitous(12Roman C. Platero J.S. Shuman J. Calame K. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1404-1415Google Scholar). C/EBPα is produced in tissues capable of gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, especially liver and fat(13Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Google Scholar), and it is considered to play a direct role in regulating transcription of some of the enzymes involved in controlling these metabolic processes(14McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Google Scholar). Recent data also suggest that C/EBPα is a key player in the differentiation of preadipocytes into fat cells(15Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Google Scholar, 16Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8757-8761Google Scholar, 17Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Google Scholar). This function includes the activation of a program of fat-specific genes and inhibition of cell growth(1Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Google Scholar). In fact, Umek et al.(1Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Google Scholar) found that expression of a conditional form of C/EBPα in preadipocytes arrested cell growth in a differentiation-independent manner. Additionally, other investigators have reported that forced expression of C/EBPα in other cell types prevents the isolation of stable cell lines due to the growth suppressing activity of this protein(18Freytag S.O. Geddes T.J. Science. 1992; 256: 379-382Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is also expressed in abundance in liver (19Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Google Scholar) but it is more widely expressed among cell types than is C/EBPα(10Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar). In the case of fat, C/EBPβ appears to play a role at the early stages of preadipocyte differentiation and it is then down-regulated as the adipocytes adopt the complete fat-specific phenotype(10Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar, 20Vasseur-Cognet M. Lane M.D. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1993; 3: 238-245Google Scholar). The role of C/EBPβ in liver is not known, but it is induced somewhat, along with C/EBPδ, during the acute phase response(21Alam T. An M.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5021-5024Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that C/EBPα is a growth suppressor(1Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Google Scholar), we have shown that C/EBPα gene transcription is inhibited during hepatocyte proliferation in the regenerating liver and in culture(22Mischoulon D. Rana B. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2553-2560Google Scholar). Additionally, studies by us and others have suggested that C/EBPα and immediate early genes are reciprocally expressed both in the liver (23Rana B. Mischoulon D. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5858-5869Google Scholar) and in other cell types(18Freytag S.O. Geddes T.J. Science. 1992; 256: 379-382Google Scholar). In fact, Freytag and Geddes (18Freytag S.O. Geddes T.J. Science. 1992; 256: 379-382Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of MYC can suppress C/EBPα expression. To determine the mechanisms controlling this apparent growth related expression of the C/EBPα gene, we have isolated the rat gene and characterized the 5’-upstream region. We have focused on a domain within the promoter that binds to a family of hepatic nuclear factors which include C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in association with other proteins. Expression of these proteins changes dramatically during liver regeneration and in response to growth factor activation of hepatocyte proliferation in culture. This pattern of C/EBP binding activity may contribute to the previously reported growth related suppression of C/EBPα transcription, as well as to the continuing expression of other liver-specific genes during hepatic growth. As regards liver regeneration, our findings support the notion that a role of C/EBPβ may be to transactivate C/EBPα, and that particular immediate early growth associated genes, as yet unidentified, are likely partners in the C/EBPβ heterodimers found to undergo cell cycle associated changes in the regenerating hepatocytes. The effects of two well known opposing growth factors (EGF and TGFβ) on particular aspects of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ activities, illuminate specific ways in which growth factors may serve to regulate hepatic regeneration at the molecular level. A rat partial SauIIIA genomic library obtained from Dr. Richard Hynes, MIT, was screened with a rat C/EBPα cDNA(24Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Google Scholar). Twelve single plaques were positive after the third screening and DNA isolated from each one was digested to completion with EcoRI. Southern blot analysis using the C/EBPα cDNA as a probe identified plaques that contained a positive 9.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment previously shown by Landschulz et al.(24Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Google Scholar) to correspond to the rat C/EBPα gene. This fragment was gel purified, cloned into the Bluescript II KS(+) vector to generate a subclone BK#9 which was used to produce several additional subclones of the entire gene within the same bluescript vector. One subclone, BK#1, corresponding to −1230 bp (BamHI) of the 5’-upstream region and 133 bp (NcoI) of transcribed 5’-untranslated sequences was used to generate a series of deletion constructs corresponding to various restriction enzyme sites within the promoter (the NcoI site corresponds to the initiation AUG for translation of the full-length C/EBPα polypeptide). Sequencing was performed on these double stranded DNA subclones by the Sanger method(25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar), using a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and a set of internal oligonucleotide primers (Genosys Biotechnologies Inc., The Woodlands, TX). A 1.36-kilobase BamHI/NcoI fragment was isolated from the Bluescript subclone BK#1 (see above) and cloned into the pCAT basic reporter plasmid (Promega) to generate a C/EBPα promoter/CAT expression vector (construct 1, see Fig. 3C). A series of deletion constructs (2-9, see Fig. 3C) were generated from this parental vector 1 using a variety of restriction enzymes identified from the sequence of the entire 1230 nucleotides of BK#1 (−1230 = BamHI, −764 = AvrII, −720 = NotI, −449 = StuI, −330 = AvrII, −270 = PmlI, −232 = EspI, and +133-NcoI). Construct 7 was generated unexpectedly during the construction of the other constructs as a result of ■ restriction enzyme activity. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the promoter region of this reporter plasmid corresponded to −110 to +133 of the 5’-upstream region of the C/EBPα gene. The other constructs produced by deletion of different regions within construct 1 using the restriction enzymes listed above is shown in Fig. 3C. HepG2 cells maintained at 50-60% confluency in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum were transfected using the calcium-phosphate DNA coprecipitation method(26Graham F.L. Eb A.J.V.D. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Google Scholar). The transfection mixture contained 10 μg of the promoter plasmid DNA, 5 μg of MSV-C/EBPβ expression vector, and 2 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid per 100-mm dish. Cells were harvested 40 h later and lysed by freeze-thawing. CAT assays were performed as described in Promega technical bulletin TB 84:8/89. The β-galactosidase activity of the cell lysates was used to normalize variabilities in the efficiency of transfection. Rats were maintained under veterinary supervision, and experimental procedures were in accordance with BUSM guidelines. Adult livers used for hepatectomy and cell culture studies were obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) weighing around 200 g, maintained under standardized light, temperature, and feeding conditions. Partial hepatectomies, with excision of 70% of the liver mass, were carried out under ether anesthesia by the method of Higgins and Anderson (27Higgins G.F. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar) and the residual lobes were allowed to regenerate over a period of 1 week. To compensate for individual variation among rats, three animals were sacrificed at each regenerating time point and their livers pooled for isolation of nuclei. Hepatocytes were isolated by a modified collagenase perfusion method as described previously(23Rana B. Mischoulon D. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5858-5869Google Scholar, 28Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Google Scholar). The final hepatocyte suspension was either analyzed immediately or plated at 5.4 × 106 cells per 100-mm Lux culture dish precoated with dried rat tail collagen. The culture medium was M-199 with Hank's salts and added 26 mM sodium bicarbonate, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10-9M dexamethasone, 5 μg of sodium linoleate (Aldrich), 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Pentax, Miles, Kankakee, IL), 20 mM sodium pyruvate, L-proline to a final concentration of 1 mM, 50 μg/ml sodium ascorbate, 20 milliunits/ml insulin, 1.5% gelatin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Unless otherwise stated, 10 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was always present, and TGFβ (R& Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was added at the doses indicated. Nuclei were isolated from hepatocytes in the liver or in culture as outlined by Mischoulon et al.(22Mischoulon D. Rana B. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2553-2560Google Scholar) and Rana et al.(23Rana B. Mischoulon D. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5858-5869Google Scholar), respectively. In each case, the nuclei were stored in nuclear suspension buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 40% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol) at −80°C until ready for use. To extract nuclear proteins, the stored nuclei were thawed on ice, harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, and protein extraction buffer (0.4 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol) was added to the nuclear pellet, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min, with occasional vortexing followed by centrifugation for 15 min. The nuclear protein supernatant was stored at −80°C after addition of glycerol to a final concentration of 15%. The protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). All the steps of nuclei isolation and the subsequent protein extraction were carried out in the cold room. These procedures were performed as described previously (23Rana B. Mischoulon D. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5858-5869Google Scholar). The sequences of the double-stranded oligonucleotides used in the EMSA studies are as follows: C/EBP, 5’-gatccGCGTTGCGCCACGATc-3’; and E Box, 5’-gatcCACGGACCACGTGTGTG-3’ (see Fig. 1 for location of each sequence within C/EBPα gene promoter). An oligonucleotide corresponding to bases −316 to −301 of the rat C/EBPα gene (see Fig. 1) was 5’-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Using this labeled oligonucleotide and a second one corresponding to bases −3 to +18, a DNA fragment (−316 to +18) was synthesized in a polymerase chain reaction containing TaqI polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequence of the resulting radiolabeled DNA probe was confirmed using the Sanger dideoxynucleotide termination procedure(25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting was performed on this probe as described by Graves et al.(29Graves B. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Cell. 1986; 44: 565-576Google Scholar). Studies by us (22Mischoulon D. Rana B. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2553-2560Google Scholar) and others (30Flodby P. Antonson P. Barlow C. Blanck A. Porsch-Hallstrom I. Xanthopoulos K.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 248-256Google Scholar) have recently shown that the decrease in C/EBPα gene expression accompanying the proliferation of hepatocytes in the regenerating rat liver is controlled at the level of transcription. Seeking the mechanisms involved, we have isolated the C/EBPα gene from a genomic library corresponding to rat liver DNA using as a probe a cDNA complementary to the full-length (2.65 kilobases) rat C/EBPα mRNA. Southern blot analysis of several recombinant phage identified a common 9.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment that contained the entire C/EBPα cDNA as shown previously by Landschulz et al.(24Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Google Scholar). Subclones of this fragment were constructed and the region corresponding to the promoter was identified by screening with a probe corresponding to the 5’-end of the cDNA. The region upstream from the start of transcription was sequenced bidirectionally by the Sanger method using sequential oligonucleotides as primers. Analysis of the initial 370 bp of this region revealed a high degree of sequence conservation between this rat gene and a previously characterized mouse gene (31Christy R.J. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2593-2597Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Domains that are completely homologous correspond to binding sites for particular transcription factors including a region that can bind C/EBP proteins in mouse cells, as well as an E box and a GC-rich region that has the potential to associate with the egr-1 family of immediate early gene products. The level of conservation within these domains suggests that they are playing an important role in regulating C/EBPα gene expression. To characterize the rat liver proteins that can associate with elements within the C/EBPα promoter, and to identify any proteins that may be involved in regulating C/EBPα transcription during hepatocyte growth and differentiation, we have performed a series of DNase I footprint and gel mobility shift assays (EMSA) using a variety of polymerse chain reaction generated fragments and oligonucleotides homologous to the putative regulatory domains. For this study, we have focused on the region homologous to that in the mouse gene that can bind to C/EBP related proteins. To map this region within the rat gene, we performed a DNase I protection assay using a polymerse chain reaction fragment extending from +15 to −316. Fig. 2A shows that recombinant C/EBPα protein footprints the region encompassing −170 to −195 bp upstream of the start of transcription. In addition, heat-treated nuclear extracts isolated from normal rat liver also protects this region from DNase I digestion. Since C/EBPα is a heat-stable protein, these data suggest that C/EBPα is at least one of the proteins in liver nuclear extracts that can associate with this site. To begin to identify these proteins, we performed EMSA using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide (CB) corresponding to the footprinted region shown in Fig. 2A. This CB oligonucleotide binds avidly to recombinant C/EBPα to form a DNA-protein complex which can be completely supershifted to the top of the gel by an anti-C/EBPα antibody (Fig. 2B). The oligonucleotide also associates with nuclear proteins isolated from rat liver which migrate as a series of 5-6 DNA-protein complexes on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2C, first lane). The specificity of this binding is demonstrated by the selective inhibition of complex formation by a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled CB oligonucleotide in the binding reaction (Fig. 2C, second lane). In contrast, a 100-fold molar excess of an unrelated oligonucleotide corresponding to the E box and its flanking region within the C/EBPα promoter (see Fig. 1) has no effect on the association of the radiolabeled CB oligonucleotide with the rat liver nuclear proteins (Fig. 2C, third lane). In an attempt to identify some of the polypeptides within these complexes, we performed supershift analysis using anti-C/EBPα and anti-C/EBPβ antibodies. This involved preincubating liver nuclear extracts with the antibody for 2 h at room temperature in order to produce a large C/EBP-antibody complex which is still capable of associating with the CB oligonucleotide. Preincubation with anti-C/EBPα antibody resulted in supershift of the slow migrating species labeled αβ which now migrate as a discrete band at the top of the gel (Fig. 2D, second lane). The lower bands (labeled β) appear to be resistant to supershift with the anti-C/EBPα antibody. All of the complexes react with the anti-C/EBPβ antibody to generate a supershifted complex which migrates as a doublet at the top of the gel (Fig. 2D, third lane). These data suggest that the larger complexes (αβ) contain both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ proteins, and possibly arise from the association of three different C/EBPα polypeptides (42, 40, and 30 kDa) with the 32-kDa C/EBPβ protein (shown below in Fig. 4B). The smaller complexes labeled β do not contain C/EBPα polypeptides, and therefore, consist of either homodimers of C/EBPβ and/or heterodimers of C/EBPβ with other nuclear proteins. An antibody against c-Jun, which supershifts complexes formed between an AP-1 oligonucleotide and c-Jun (data not shown), has no effect on the migration of the C/EBP complexes (αβ and β) within the gel (Fig. 2D, fourth lane) demonstrating the specificity of the anti-C/EBP supershifts. The EMSA data in Fig. 2D shows that C/EBPβ when compared to C/EBPα plays a more prominent role in directing the binding of rat liver proteins to the C/EBP site within the C/EBPα promoter. It is likely, therefore, that C/EBPβ plays a role in controlling the transcription of the C/EBPα gene during the growth and differentiation of hepatocytes in the liver. To explore this possibility, we have determined whether C/EBPβ protein can transactivate the rat C/EBPα promoter in transiently transfected human hepatoma cells (HepG2). To demonstrate that transient co-transfection of this expression vector results in the ectopic production of rat C/EBPβ in human HepG2 cells, we performed the experiment illustrated in Fig. 3, A and B. A MSV-C/EBPβ expression vector as well as a MSV-C/EBPα vector, used as a control, were transiently transfected into separate cultures of HepG2 cells at the same time that the transactivation-CAT assays (Fig. 3C, below) were being performed. Forty-eight hours following the transfection, total RNA and nuclear proteins were isolated from control non-transfected, MSV-C/EBPβ, and MSV-C/EBPα transfected cells and appropriate samples were subjected to Northern blot analysis and EMSA. In Fig. 3A, the same Northern blot corresponding to rat liver RNA (first lane) as well as nontransfected (second lane) and transfected (right two lanes) HepG2 cell RNAs was probed with rat C/EBPα (upper panel) and rat C/EBPβ (lower panel) cDNAs. The lower panel of Fig. 3A shows that HepG2 cells express appreciable amounts of C/EBPβ mRNA which migrates slightly slower (larger mRNA) in the gel than the corresponding rat liver mRNA (compare lanes 1 and 2). Transfection of the rat C/EBPβ expression vector results in the production of abundant amounts of the corresponding mRNA to a level that is even greater than that expressed in the same quantity of rat liver RNA (compare first and fourth lanes). The upper panel shows barely detectable amounts of the human C/EBPα mRNA in nontransfected HepG2 cells (second lane) as expected for hepatoma cells which have down-regulated the C/EBPα gene(13Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Google Scholar). Tranfection of the rat C/EBPα expression vector results in the production of significant amounts of the corresponding rat mRNA (third lane). Cells transfected with the rat C/EBPβ expression vector produce very low amounts of the human C/EBPα mRNA (fourth lane) demonstrating that ectopic expressio"

Cleavage occurs between the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper and the first transmembrane domain of each SREBP. This is the region in which the SREBPs are cleaved physiologically by a sterol-regulated protease that releases an NH2-terminal fragment that activates transcription of the genes for the low density lipoprotein receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase.

The NH2-terminal regions of both SREBP-1a and −2 are classic transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family. This region terminates approximately at residue 400 of each protein. This is followed by a spacer region of ~90 amino acids, followed by a pair of hydrophobic sequences that anchor the proteins to membranes, followed by a long COOH-terminal extension of ~500 amino acids(5Sato R.

Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar, 5Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Google Scholar, 7Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Google Scholar). This frees the NH2-terminal segment, which enters the nucleus and binds to sterol-regulatory elements in the promoters of the LDL receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase genes. The SREBPs activate transcription by virtue of acidic domains at their NH2 termini(5Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Google Scholar). When sterols accumulate in cells, cleavage of both SREBPs is reduced, and any residual SREBP in the nucleus is rapidly degraded by a proteolytic enzyme that is sensitive to inhibition by N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal(4Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar). In cultured cells SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 are regulated coordinately; they appear to act in a redundant fashion, and there is no evidence that heterodimers are required(2Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar, 3Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Google Scholar). In hamster liver SREBP-1 and −2 appear to be regulated independently and not coordinately(8Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Google Scholar). The proteases that process SREBP-1 and −2 in cultured cells or in liver have not been identified. In the current experiments we have identified and purified an intracellular protease that cleaves SREBP-1a and −2 selectively in the region between the leucine zipper and the first transmembrane domain. The protease has properties consistent with those of a new family of cysteine proteases as defined by the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE)(9Thornberry N.A. Molineaux S.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 3-12Google Scholar). Peptide sequencing of the purified protease reveals it to be the hamster homologue of human CPP32, a member of the ICE family that was cloned by virtue of its DNA sequence resemblance to ICE, but which has not been studied for proteolytic activity in vitro(10Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Google Scholar). We here describe the purification and properties of this protease as it relates to the cleavage of SREBP-1a and −2. We obtained bovine pancreatic trypsin (sequencing grade), protease V8, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and all protease inhibitors from Boehringer Mannheim; individual unlabeled amino acids from Life Technologies, Inc.; radioactive amino acids from Amersham Corp.; N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) from Sigma; and Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-YVAD-CHO) from BACHEM Bioscience, Inc. Site-specific mutagenesis of the cDNAs for human SREBP-2 (Asp-468 ⟶ Ala) and SREBP-1a (Asp-460 ⟶ Ala) were performed as described by Kunkel et al.(11Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar) using the Muta-gene Phagemid kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA clones for human SREBP-1a(2Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar), human SREBP-2(3Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Google Scholar), and rabbit oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) (12Dawson P.A. Ridgway N.D. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16798-16803Google Scholar) were described in the indicated reference. Human HeLa S3 cells were grown in spinner culture as described elsewhere(13Wang X. Briggs M.R. Hua X. Yokoyama C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14497-14504Google Scholar). Male Golden Syrian hamsters (100-120 g), obtained from Sasco (Omaha, NE), were exposed to a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed a standard mouse/rat chow diet (Teklad, Madison, WI). SREBP-1a cloned into the SalI site of pBluescript SK(+), SREBP-2 cloned into the EcoRI site of λEXlox(+) vector, and OSBP cloned into the EcoRI/SmaI site of pGEM-4 were prepared using a Maxiprep kit (Promega) and translated in the TNT T3 (for SREBP-1a) or SP6 (for SREBP-2 and OSBP) coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Each coupled transcription-translation reaction contained 5-10 μg of plasmid DNA in a final volume of 400 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation at 30°C for 2 h, each translated SREBP was purified by passing the transcription-translation mixture through a 10-ml Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer A (10 mM Hepes-KOH at pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM sodium EDTA, 1 mM sodium EGTA, 0.5-1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors that consisted of 0.1 mM Pefabloc, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal. The translated proteins contained within the exclusion volume of the column were used in assays described below. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against human SREBP-1a (amino acids 31-175) (2Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar) and human SREBP-2 (amino acids 48-403) (3Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Google Scholar) were prepared as described in the indicated reference. A monoclonal antibody IgG-1C6 (IgG subclass 1) was produced by immunizing a female Balb/C mouse with a fusion protein encoding amino acids 833-1141 of human SREBP-2 (3Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Google Scholar) followed by the FLAG octapeptide DYKDDDDK (14Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Google Scholar). 2 IgG-1C6 was purified from ascites fluid by protein G-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously(4Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar). The primary antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (made in donkeys) using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Corp.). SREBP-1a or SREBP-2 was translated as described above in a methionine-free amino acid mixture supplemented with 750 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). After passage through the G-25 Sephadex column (see above), 5 μl of the translation mixture were incubated at 30°C for varying times with enzyme fractions in a final volume of 25 μl of buffer A supplemented with the mixture of protease inhibitors. At the end of the incubation, 25 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) were added to each tube, after which each sample was boiled for 3 min and then subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was subsequently dried and exposed at room temperature to Reflection film (DuPont NEN) for 16 h. All purification steps were performed at 4°C except for the SP-Sepharose chromatography, which was done at room temperature. Cell pellets from 100 liters of HeLa cells were suspended in ~5 volume of buffer A with protease inhibitors, disrupted by Dounce homogenization, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 105× g for 1 h in a Sorvall AH629 rotor. The resulting supernatant (S-100 fraction) was incubated at 30°C for 2 h before fractionation. This step was necessary to activate the cleavage enzyme. The pH of the activated S-100 fraction (7.5 g of protein) was adjusted to 6.5 with concentrated HCl, and the mixture was applied to an SP-Sepharose column (100-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A adjusted to pH 6.5 and supplemented with 0.1 mM Pefabloc). The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer B and then eluted with 2 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.5 M NaCl. The column eluate was dialyzed overnight against two changes of 2 liters of buffer A containing 0.1 mM Pefabloc. The pH of the dialyzed 0.5 M NaCl eluate from Step 2 (480 mg of protein) was adjusted to 8.3 with 1 N NaOH, and the mixture was passed through a 0.22-μm filter. One-half of the preparation was loaded onto a Mono Q 10/10 column equilibrated in buffer C (buffer A adjusted to pH 8.3 and supplemented with 0.1 mM Pefabloc). The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer C and then eluted in 4-ml fractions with an 80-ml linear salt gradient (0 to 0.3 M NaCl). The other half of the preparation was processed on an identical column. Fractions containing SCA activity (eluting at ~150 mM NaCl; fractions 8-10) from the two columns were pooled and concentrated in a Centriprep 10 concentrator (Amicon). The concentrated pooled fraction from Step 3 (15 mg of protein) was applied to a Superdex 75 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer A with 0.1 mM Pefabloc. After filtration, the active fractions were pooled and stored in multiple aliquots at −80°C. This fraction is referred to as “partially purified SCA” and is used in all experiments except Fig. 9 and Table 2.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab All purification steps were carried out at 4°C except for the SP-Sepharose chromatography, which was done at room temperature. Livers from 25 hamsters (125 g each), rinsed once with 700 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with 700 ml of cold buffer A with protease mixture, were homogenized for 15 s in the same buffer (0.4 g/ml) in a specially designed Waring blender (16Lichtsteiner S. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Cell. 1987; 51: 963-973Google Scholar, 17Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Google Scholar) followed by three strokes of a motor-driven homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 105× g for 1 h in a Sorvall AH 629 rotor. The resulting supernatant (S-100 fraction) was filtered through a layer of cheese cloth and dialyzed overnight against three changes of 6 liters of buffer A with 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The S-100 fraction from Step 1 (14 g of protein) was incubated at 30°C for 2 h, after which it was adjusted to pH 6.5 with concentrated HCl. One-half of the preparation was loaded onto a 200-ml SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer B. After washing with 2 column volumes of buffer B, the column was eluted with buffer A containing 0.5 M NaCl. The other one-half of the preparation was processed on an identical column. The active fractions were pooled (500 ml) and dialyzed overnight against two changes of 6 liters of buffer A with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The dialyzed fractions from Step 2 (2.56 g of protein) were adjusted to pH to 8.3 with 1 N NaOH and loaded onto a 100-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer C. The column was eluted with a 500-ml linear salt gradient (0-0.3 M NaCl), and 10-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing SCA (eluting at ~175 mM NaCl; fractions 17-44) were pooled and used directly in the next step. The pooled fractions from Step 3 in buffer C (392 mg of protein) were loaded onto a 10-ml hydroxylapatite column (Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxylapatite, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of 0.1 M potassium phosphate at pH 6.8 and eluted with an 80-ml linear gradient (0.1-0.4 M potassium phosphate), and 4-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing SCA (eluting at ~0.3 M potassium phosphate; fractions 3-12) were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM sodium EDTA, 1 mM sodium EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM Pefabloc). The pooled fractions from Step 4 (50 mg of protein) were loaded onto a Mono Q 10/10 fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer D and eluted with a 120-ml linear salt gradient (0-0.3 M NaCl). Fractions of 5 ml were collected. Fractions containing SCA (eluting at ~150 mM NaCl; fractions 6-9) were pooled and concentrated to 2.25 ml with a Centricon 10 (Amicon). The pooled fractions from Step 5 (~12 mg of protein) were loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer A with 0.1 mM Pefabloc and eluted with the same buffer. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer E (50 mM MES-HCl at pH 6.0, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM sodium EDTA, 1 mM sodium EGTA, 1 mM DTT; 0.1 mM Pefabloc). The pooled fractions from Step 6 (~6 mg of protein) were loaded onto a Mono S 5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography column. SCA was eluted in 2.5-ml fractions with a 50-ml linear salt gradient (0-1 M NaCl). Fractions containing SCA (eluting at ~325 mM NaCl; fractions 4-9) were pooled and concentrated. The pooled fractions from Step 7 (~2 mg of protein) were loaded onto a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with buffer A with 0.1 mM Pefabloc. The column was eluted with the same buffer, and the active fractions were pooled and concentrated with a Centricon 10 (~0.5 mg protein). This fraction is referred to as “partially purified SCA” and is used in the experiments of Fig. 9 and Table 2. In vitro translated SREBP-2 (unlabeled) was incubated with a polymerase chain reaction-generated 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing two tandem copies of the wild-type or mutant SRE-1 element of the LDL receptor promoter. Probes were synthesized and purified, and the DNA binding reactions and electrophoresis were performed as described previously(13Wang X. Briggs M.R. Hua X. Yokoyama C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14497-14504Google Scholar, 17Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Google Scholar). The mRNAs encoding SREBP-1 and −2 were translated in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate supplemented with an amino acid mixture devoid of one amino acid (arginine, proline, valine, or leucine). The translation reaction was supplemented with the corresponding radioactive amino acid: 250 μCi/ml [2,3,4,5-3H]leucine (150 Ci/mmol), 250 μCi/ml [2,3,4,5-3H]proline (57 Ci/mmol), 250 μCi/ml [2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (58 Ci/mmol), or 12.5 μCi/ml [U-14C]valine (265 mCi/mmol). After passage through the G-25 Sephadex column (see above), 100-μl aliquots of each labeled SREBP were incubated at 30°C for 30 min with 20 μg of SCA partially purified from HeLa cells (Superdex 75 fraction) in a final volume of 200 μl of buffer A with the protease mixture. The reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to poly(vinylidene fluoride) membranes (Immobilon-PSQ, Millipore). After drying, the membranes were exposed to an imaging plate and scanned in a Fuji X Bas 1000 PhosphorImager. The bands containing the COOH-terminal product of the cleavage reaction were excised and subjected directly to multiple cycles of Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 477A sequencer. Fractions from each cycle (250 μl) were collected, and a 200-μl aliquot was counted in a scintillation counter. Partially purified SCA from hamster liver (Step 8, ~0.25 mg) was subjected to electrophoresis in a 10-20% SDS gradient gel and then transferred onto a piece of poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane (Immobilon-PSQ, Millipore). The 20-kDa subunit was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and excised for direct NH2-terminal sequencing and solid-phase tryptic digestion (18Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was carried out as described previously(19Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Slaughter C.A. Sdhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1992; 70: 1049-1057Google Scholar). Ac-Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEAD-CHO) was synthesized from the known Boc-Asp(OBzl)-HO(20Stanfield C.F. Parker J.E. Kanellis P. J. Org. Chem. 1981; 46: 4797-4798Google Scholar). The aldehyde functionality of Boc-Asp(OBzl)-HO was protected as the semicarbazone (SC) and the Boc group removed under standard acidic conditions to give Asp(OBzl)-SC. Condensation of this semicarbazone with Boc-Ala affords Boc-Ala-Asp(OBzl)-SC. The Boc protecting group was removed under acidic conditions and the resulting Ala-Asp(OBzl)-SC was coupled to Ac-Asp(OBzl)-Glu(OBzl)-OH to yield Ac-Asp(OBzl)-Glu(OBzl)-Ala-Asp (OBzl)-SC. The final product was obtained after deprotection of the carboxylic acid residues by hydrogenolysis and deprotection of the aldehyde functionality with acetic acid and formaldehyde and was then purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. To screen for a protease that cleaves SREBP, we translated the mRNA for SREBP in vitro in the presence of 35S-labeled amino acids and incubated the protein with cytosolic and membrane extracts from sterol-depleted cells. We searched for an activity that would cleave SREBP so as to generate an NH2-terminal fragment similar in size to the nuclear form of the protein as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All of our initial attempts were unsuccessful. Either we failed to observe proteolysis or we observed multiple fragments of inappropriate size. We eventually settled upon a strategy in which cells were homogenized in a buffer containing a mixture of inhibitors of serine, aspartyl, and metalloproteases in order to prevent nonspecific cleavage. Under these conditions we observed a trace amount of specific SCA in the cytosolic fraction of HeLa cells. The activity was markedly increased when the cytosolic fraction was preincubated for 2 h at 30°C. Using the preincubated cytosol as a starting material, we were able to obtain a partial purification of SCA from HeLa cells and hamster liver by sequential column fractionation as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 demonstrates the ability of partially purified SCA from HeLa cells to cleave in vitro translated 35S-labeled SREBP-1a and SREBP-2, as monitored by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In vitro translation of the SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 mRNAs produced precursor proteins that migrated in the range of 125 kDa (lanes 1 and 3). Incubation with SCA generated two major cleaved products of ~55 and 70 kDa from either SREBP-1a or SREBP-2 (lanes 2 and 4). In addition, a minor cleaved product just below the 55-kDa band was observed in the case of SREBP-2 (lane 4). As a control for specificity, we used another in vitro translated protein, OSBP. SCA caused no appreciable cleavage of this protein (lanes 5 and 6). To identify the cleavage products of the SCA reaction, we translated the mRNA for SREBP-2 in the absence of labeled amino acids, digested it with SCA, performed SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with antibodies directed against either the NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal domains of SREBP-2 (Fig. 2). The lower band, with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa, reacted with the antibody against the NH2 terminus (lane 2), and the upper band, with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa, reacted with the antibody directed against the COOH terminus (lane 4). Fig. 3 shows an experiment in which the size of the NH2-terminal fragment of SREBP-1a that was generated in vitro was compared with that isolated from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The in vivo nuclear protein migrated as a doublet at ~65 kDa (lane 1). This was reduced to the range of ~55 kDa after treatment with alkaline phosphatase (lane 2). The in vitro translated SREBP-1a was cleaved by SCA to generate an NH2-terminal fragment with an apparent molecular mass of ~55 kDa (lane 4), which was within the range of the phosphatase-treated protein from the nuclear extracts (lane 2). Treatment of the in vitro translated SREBP-1a with alkaline phosphatase caused no change in molecular weight (lane 5). We conclude from this experiment that SCA cuts SREBP-1a at a site that is close to the site that generates the nuclear fragment in intact cells. These data also provide the first evidence that SREBP-1a from nuclear extracts is phosphorylated. Similar results were obtained with respect to the NH2-terminal fragment of SREBP-2 (data not shown). As a further test for specificity, we compared the specific cleavage of SREBP-2 by SCA and by two nonspecific proteases, trypsin and protease V-8 (Fig. 4). The two specific products of cleavage were observed when 50 ng of partially purified SCA were used (lane 3). Increasing the amount of SCA 10-fold to 500 ng yielded more of the same cleavage products, but there was no evidence of further breakdown to smaller fragments (lane 4). Treatment with 5 ng of trypsin partially cleaved SREBP-2 to a variety of fragments (lane 6), and 50 ng completely destroyed the protein (lane 7). Similar results were obtained with V8 protease (lanes 9-12). In this and other experiments, we were unable to find a concentration of trypsin or V8 protease that cleaved either SREBP-2 or SREBP-1a selectively at the site of SCA cleavage. Fig. 5 shows that the NH2-terminal cleavage product generated by SCA from SREBP-2 was active in binding in vitro to its specific DNA recognition sequence, designated SRE-1 (13Wang X. Briggs M.R. Hua X. Yokoyama C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14497-14504Google Scholar). Full-length in vitro translated SREBP-2 was incubated with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide that contains two copies of the 10-base pair SRE-1. Although full-length SREBP-1c has been previously demonstrated to bind SRE-1"

Protease protection experiments with intact canine rough microsomes showed that amino acid residues 1-462 of calnexin are located within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression using the baculovirus Sf9 insect cell system of a recombinant truncated calnexin corresponding to residues 1-462 (calnexinΔTMC) revealed an association in vivo with a coexpressed secretory glycoprotein substrate, human immunodeficiency virus type I gp120. For the in vitro characterization of calnexinΔTMC, we purified this secreted form to homogeneity from the medium of Sf9 cells. We demonstrate that the properties of the purified calnexinΔTMC correspond to those of full-length calnexin in canine microsomes with at least one intramolecular disulfide bond and binding to 45Ca2+. CalnexinΔTMC underwent a marked and reversible conformational change following Ca2+ binding as measured by its resistance to proteinase K digestion of a 60-kDa fragment and also by the change from an oligomeric form of calnexinΔTMC to a monomeric form. We also found that calnexin bound Mg-ATP leading to a conformational change from a monomeric to an oligomeric form that coincided as with markedly increased proteinase sensitivity. Our results identify the luminal domain of calnexin as responsible for binding substrates, Ca2+, and Mg-ATP. Because Ca2+ and ATP are required in vivo for the maintenance of calnexin-substrate interactions, conformational changes in the luminal domain of calnexin induced by Ca2+ and Mg-ATP are relevant to the in vivo function of calnexin as a molecular chaperone.

The function of calnexin as a molecular chaperone initially arose from the demonstration that it is associated in the ER with newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain and other cell surface receptors (see 2Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Google Scholar for review). Subsequently the repertoire of membrane protein substrates for calnexin was expanded to soluble monomeric secretory glycoproteins (24Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 671-676Google Scholar; 19Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Google Scholar; 33Wada I. Ou W.-J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Google Scholar). It was observed that there is a requirement for glycosylation for proteins to bind to calnexin in vivo, because the N-linked glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin prevented the association of newly synthesized, incompletely folded substrates with calnexin (24Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 671-676Google Scholar). In addition, deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine, inhibitors of glucosidase I and II, also abrogated the association of newly synthesized, incompletely folded viral membrane glycoproteins with calnexin. These observations led to the proposal that calnexin was a lectin with specificity for monoglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides (15Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis has come from the recent demonstrations of direct binding between a recombinant soluble calnexin and the free oligosaccharide Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 (34Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Google Scholar) and of binding of glucosylated thyroglobulin and soybean agglutinin in a cell free system.2 2W.-J. Ou, J. J. M. Bergeron, A. Parodi, and D. Y. Thomas, submitted for publication. However, in vivo calnexin can also bind non-glycosylated proteins (26Rajagopalan S. Xu Y. Brenner M.B. Science. 1994; 263: 387-390Google Scholar; 21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Google Scholar; 17Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Google Scholar). The N-linked oligosaccharide can also be removed by endoglycosidase H from coimmunoprecipitates of substrates bound to calnexin without disrupting their association (34Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the N-linked oligosaccharide may be preferred for the initial interaction of newly synthesized glycoproteins with calnexin but is not necessary to maintain the interaction. There are several different regions of calnexin that have been argued to be responsible for binding substrates. The transmembrane and immediate juxtamembrane regions of newly synthesized substrate membrane proteins have been indicated to be required for binding to calnexin (22Margolese L. Waneck G.L. Suzuki C.K. Degen E. Flavell R.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17959-17966Google Scholar). A role for cytosolically oriented phosphorylation of calnexin has also been proposed in the association of different allotypes of major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains with calnexin (7Capps G.G. Ziga M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11634-11639Google Scholar). Furthermore, an ATP requirement has been demonstrated for the association of the newly synthesized soluble glycoprotein gp80 with calnexin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (33Wada I. Ou W.-J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Google Scholar). However, it is clear that secretory glycoproteins can only interact directly with the luminal domain of calnexin and that membrane substrates also have the opportunity for this interaction. Taken together, these studies indicate multiple mechanisms of presentation and binding of substrates to calnexin (2Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Google Scholar). In order to establish the mechanism of association of calnexin with its substrates and to determine the cofactors involved, we have expressed a soluble recombinant derivative of calnexin in the baculovirus-infected Sf9 expression system. We demonstrate here that soluble calnexin can associate with the newly synthesized soluble glycoprotein substrate HIV-1 gp120 when they are coexpressed in Sf9 cells. We further show that soluble calnexin purified from the extracellular medium of recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells undergoes conformational changes as revealed by the formation of a Ca2+-dependent proteinase-resistant core and a Ca2+-dependent change from an oligomeric to a monomeric state, whereas Mg-ATP promoted a change from a monomeric to an oligomeric state that coincided with increased proteinase sensitivity. Finally, we show that secreted soluble calnexin is at least partially disulfide-bonded intramolecularly and can bind ATP directly but does not have detectable ATPase activity. These findings extend the functional significance of calnexin as an ATP-binding molecular chaperone with properties distinguishable from those of the ER luminal Ca2+-binding and ATP-binding chaperone, BiP. cDNA encoding a truncated canine calnexin (amino acid residues 1-462) followed immediately by an in-frame stop codon was generated by polymerase chain reaction and subsequently cloned into the transfer vector pETL1 at the BamHI site filled in with Klenow polymerase. The recombinant baculovirus was isolated by the β-galactosidase screening and used to infect Sf9 cells that were grown in Sf9000 II serum-free medium as described by 31Vialard J. Lalumire M. Vernet T. Briedis D. Alkhatib G. Henning D. Levin D. Richardson C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 37-50Google Scholar. The sequence of the calnexin construct in the baculovirus vector was confirmed, and the following differences were observed with the published sequence (32Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty II, J.-J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Google Scholar). Nucleotides 199 and 201 are determined to be A and A and not T and C, respectively, as previously determined. This changes the codon for residue 67 from TCC to ACA, and the corresponding amino acid change is Ser67 to Thr67. There is also a threonine at this position in human calnexin (10David V. Hochstenbach F. Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9585-9592Google Scholar). The sequence of a peptide of canine calnexin from this region also predicted a threonine at this position. Thus we conclude that the original canine calnexin nucleotide sequence is incorrect in this region. We also found one other difference with the published canine calnexin nucleotide sequence at nucleotide 201, which is a change of the originally predicted C to an A; this does not change the amino acid sequence. Expression of HIV-1 gp120 in Sf9 cells by recombinant baculovirus has been described previously (20Li Y. Luo L. Thomas D.Y. Kang C.Y. Virology. 1994; 204: 266-278Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing calnexinΔTMC and grown for 72 h. PMSF and p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonic acid (final concentrations, 1 mM and 0.1 mM, respectively) were added to the medium. All of the buffers used for purification of calnexin contained 1 mM CaCl2. Ammonium sulfate (70% saturation) was added to the medium, and the supernatant was passed through a phenyl-Sepharose column (2.7 × 5 cm). The flow-through was desalted using a G-25 Sephadex column and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.7 × 10 cm) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl. The column was washed with the same buffer, and the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 50-600 mM NaCl. The calnexinΔTMC-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated with a Centriprep 30 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and further purified on a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono-Q column (10/10) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl. The proteins were eluted with a gradient of 200-800 mM NaCl. CalnexinΔTMC was detected by immunoblotting with anti-CN1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody made against a synthetic peptide encompassing residues 30-48 of the NH2 terminus of calnexin. This antibody recognizes mammalian calnexin but not insect calnexin. Purified calnexinΔTMC (1 mg/ml) was incubated with increasing concentrations of proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl buffer at 30°C for 30 min. Protease digestion of native calnexin was carried out using solubilized canine pancreatic ER membranes (2 mg/ml) in the presence of 1% CHAPS (Sigma). After the addition of 1 mM PMSF to the proteinase K incubations, proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE (5%-15% gel) followed by Coomassie Blue staining for the purified calnexinΔTMC (see Fig. 6A) or by immunoblotting with anti-CN1 for the ER membranes (see Fig. 6B). Purified calnexinΔTMC (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with 20 μCi/ml (25 μM) [α-32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol; DuPont Canada, Mississauga, Ontario) in 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2 at 20°C for 10 min and then exposed to UV radiation for 5 min. For inhibition experiments, reagents were incubated with calnexin prior to the addition of [α-32P]ATP. The 32P-labeled protein was separated on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue followed by radioautography. 24 h after infection with recombinant baculoviruses, Sf9 cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) for 15 min at 25°C. The labeled cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 200 mM NaCl, 2% CHAPS, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin. The cell lysate was precleared with protein A-Sepharose and immuno-precipitated with anti-CN1 or anti-gp120 antibodies as described previously (24Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 671-676Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined as described by 4Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar. The 45Ca2+ overlay assay was as described in 32Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty II, J.-J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Google Scholar. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by 18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was carried out in the absence of SDS using the Laemmli system. Protein sequencing of calnexinΔTMC or its protease-cleaved fragments was determined using an Applied Biosystems 470A protein sequencer equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer. From its primary sequence calnexin is predicted to be a type I integral membrane protein of the ER (32Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty II, J.-J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Google Scholar). In this study we confirm the orientation of calnexin in the ER membrane by using proteinase K digestion of canine microsomes and antibodies to peptides in different regions of calnexin (Fig. 1). Digestion of intact microsomes revealed a 70-kDa proteinase-resistant fragment, indicating that the majority of the protein was intraluminal (Fig. 1A). The result is consistent with the demonstration that in dog cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles a 70-kDa fragment of calnexin is protected from digestion by proteases (6Cala S.E. Ulbright C. Kelley J.S. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2969-2975Google Scholar). Both the native and protease-resistant fragment of calnexin were recognized by antibodies to residues 30-48 of calnexin (anti-CN1). Antibodies to residues 555-573 (anti-CN4) only recognized full-length calnexin in intact microsomes, and proteinase treatment abolished this recognition (Fig. 1B). These results confirm that in vivo calnexin is a type I membrane protein and that residues 1-462 of calnexin are luminally oriented followed by a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain and a cytosolically oriented COOH-terminal tail (Fig. 1C). Because calnexin can transiently bind both membrane and soluble secretory proteins, the luminal domain is predicted to be responsible for this interaction. With type I membrane proteins removal of the membrane spanning domain can lead to their secretion from cells. Introduction of a stop codon at residue 463 (i.e. immediately preceding the predicted transmembrane domain of calnexin) (Fig. 1C) led to the secretion of calnexinΔTMC. 24 h after recombinant baculovirus infection (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4), intracellular calnexinΔTMC with a mobility of 70 kDa was recognized by the anti-CN1 antibody with increasing amounts of the protein being secreted at 48, 72, and 96 h postinfection (Fig. 2, lanes 5-10). Whereas two polypeptides of 70- and 69-kDa were observed for intracellular calnexinΔTMC (Fig. 2, lanes 5, 7, and 9), extracellularly only the 70-kDa form was observed (Fig. 2, lanes 6, 8, and 10). We devised an experiment that clearly shows that calnexinΔTMC can interact in vivo with a viral glycoprotein. We compared the association of calnexinΔTMC and that of full-length calnexin with a calnexin substrate, HIV-1 gp120.3 3Y. Li, J. J. M. Bergeron, W.-J. Ou, C. Y. Kang, and D. Y. Thomas, submitted for publication. HIV-1 gp120 is normally processed from the precursor gp160 by proteolytic cleavage, generating soluble gp120 and the COOH-terminal membrane attached gp41; but in this experiment gp120 alone was expressed by inserting a termination codon at the site of cleavage.3 As shown in Fig. 3, 24 h after infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant baculovirus containing calnexinΔTMC (lane 1), HIV-1 gp120 (lane 2), or full-length calnexin (lane 5), they could be detected by immunoprecipitation of pulse-labeled cells with either anti-CN1 (lanes 1 and 5) or anti-HIV-1 IgG (Fig. 3, lane 2). Coinfection with baculoviruses containing either calnexinΔTMC (Fig. 3, lane 3) or full-length calnexin (Fig. 3, lane 6) with HIV-1 gp120 revealed their association because they could be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-CN1. The lack of radiolabeled calnexin in the immunoprecipitates with HIV-1 IgG (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 7) is due to the large pool of pre-existing calnexin (24Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 671-676Google Scholar). The gp120 molecules that were associated with calnexin (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 6) were incompletely folded, because they were not recognized by the receptor CD4, as has been recently shown for full-length calnexin3 and was also shown for gp120 in association with calnexinΔTMC (data not shown). Thus, full-length calnexin and calnexinΔTMC appear to be equally capable of interacting with a soluble glycoprotein substrate. The association of intracellular soluble calnexinΔTMC with gp120 suggested that the luminal domain alone interacts with substrates. Thus we used this expression system to purify calnexinΔTMC for in vitro characterization. At 72 h postinfection, calnexinΔTMC was about 1% of the total protein in the medium from Sf9 cells, and it was purified to homogeneity (see “Experimental Procedures”). The final preparation showed a single band for calnexinΔTMC with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). We confirmed the NH2-terminal sequence of the first 20 residues of the purified protein as HEGHD(D)(D)MID(I)ED(D)LD(D)VIE (residues in parentheses indicate the inherent difficulty in identifying consecutive residues), which is identical to that for calnexin purified from microsomes (32Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty II, J.-J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Google Scholar). The luminal domain of calnexin shows 4 regions of sequence similarity with calreticulin, the major ER luminal calcium-binding protein (Fig. 1C and 32Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty II, J.-J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 5 show that the detergent phase of Triton X-114-extracted canine pancreatic ER membranes contains a major calcium-binding protein corresponding to calnexin (90 kDa) as well as the other major calcium-binding ER membrane protein pgp35 (35 kDa) (Fig. 5, lane 1). We were also able to show that purified soluble calnexinΔTMC can bind calcium using the 45Ca2+ overlay technique, whereas in a control experiment bovine serum albumin did not (Fig. 5, lane 3). Thus both full-length calnexin from ER membranes and purified calnexinΔTMC show similar behavior in their ability to bind calcium. Sensitivity to proteinase digestion was used to evaluate protein domain structure. When calnexinΔTMC was incubated with low concentrations (1-10 μg/ml) of proteinase K in the presence of calcium, a 65-kDa fragment was generated (Fig. 6A, lanes 2-4). With increasing concentrations of the proteinase (100-300 μg/ml), a fragment of 60 kDa was generated (Fig. 6A, lanes 6 and 7). The proteinase digestion of native calnexin in the solubilized ER membrane resulted in a similar profile (Fig. 6, compare A, lanes 2-7, with B, lanes 2-7). Low (1-10 μg/ml) and high (100-300 μg/ml) concentrations of the proteinase-produced fragments of 65 and 60 kDa, respectively (Fig. 6, compare A and B, lanes 19 and 20). Sequence analysis of the 60-kDa fragment revealed the major sequence to be K26SKPDTSAPTSP, and therefore it includes the sequence used to generate the anti-CN1 antibody (residues 30-48). Digestion of calnexinΔTMC with trypsin in the presence of calcium also generated the 60-kDa fragment (Fig. 6C, lanes 4 and 5); but the sequence was S27KPDTSAPTSP, just one residue downstream from the proteinase K cleavage site. Our data indicate that proteinase-sensitive sites exist at both the carboxyl and the amino termini of calnexin. But there is a proteinase-resistant core structure that requires calcium to maintain resistance, because, in the presence of EGTA, both calnexinΔTMC and native calnexin became highly sensitive to a low concentration (10 μg/ml) of proteinase K (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 8-13). To determine if the proteinase-resistant and -sensitive forms of calnexin are reversible, calnexinΔTMC was first incubated with EGTA, leading to the proteinase-sensitive conformation, and then excess calcium was added to the protein followed by the addition of proteinase K. This procedure restored the proteinase-resistant conformation (Fig. 6A, lanes 14-19). Full-length calnexin also displayed the same reversible conformational change of calnexinΔTMC (Fig. 6B, lanes 14-19). Thus both full-length calnexin from ER membranes and purified calnexinΔTMC can be digested with protease to generate the same resistant core fragment. Calnexin has four cysteine residues (161, 195, 361, and 367 for canine calnexin), which are conserved in calnexins from all species (Fig. 7). To investigate the redox state of secreted purified calnexin, we compared the mobility of the protein on SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 8). Usually monomeric proteins with intramolecular disulfide bonds migrate faster on nonreducing gels than on reducing gels. Under nonreducing conditions, the mobility of both calnexinΔTMC and native calnexin in isolated ER membranes revealed an increased mobility (Fig. 8, compare lanes 1 and 2 and compare lanes 3 and 4), indicating that calnexin contains at least one internal disulfide bond. As a positive control, we used albumin, which contains 17 disulfide bonds (27Simon W.L. Dugaiczyk A. Nature. 1981; 291: 201-205Google Scholar), and detected a larger increase in mobility under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 8, lanes 5 and 6). Because calnexin can only contain at the most two disulfide bonds, the mobility shift found was correspondingly less. Hence, at least one and perhaps both potential disulfide bonds in calnexin are formed intramolecularly.Figure 8:Disulfide bonding of calnexinΔTMC. Purified calnexinΔTMC (lanes 1 and 2), canine pancreatic ER membranes (lanes 3 and 4), or bovine serum albumin (BSA, lanes 5 and 6) were separated on SDS-PAGE under reducing (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or nonreducing (lanes 2, 4, and 6) conditions followed by immunoblotting with anti-CN1 (lanes 1-4) or staining with Coomassie Blue (C. B.) (lanes 5 and 6). Small differences in mobility were observed for disulfide bonded (ox) and reduced (red) forms of calnexinΔTMC (ΔCN) or native calnexin (CN).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Purified calnexinΔTMC was analyzed on native gels to investigate its state of oligomerization (Fig. 9, A and B). In the presence of calcium, calnexinΔTMC was a monomer (Fig. 9, A and B, lanes 2). However, after incubation with EGTA, dimeric and oligomeric calnexinΔTMC were observed (Fig. 9, A and B, lanes 3). These oligomers were also visualized by immunoblotting (Fig. 9B, lane 3) with anti-CN1, which reacted more strongly with oligomeric calnexin than with monomeric calnexin. Remarkably, ATP also induced the formation of calnexin oligomers, suggesting the direct interaction of the nucleotide with calnexinΔTMC (Fig. 9, A and B, lanes 4). The stronger binding of anti-CN1 antibody to ATP-induced oligomers of calnexin is also consistent with a conformational change exposing the epitope. When native calnexin was analyzed on nondenaturing gels, the protein migrated as large aggregates on the top part of the gels (data not shown). Because both EGTA and ATP induced oligomerization of calnexinΔTMC, we tested the protease sensitivity of calnexinΔTMC in the presence of ATP. When purified calnexinΔTMC was treated first with Mg-ATP and then with proteinase K (Fig. 9C, lanes 6 and 7), calnexinΔTMC was completely digested. Addition of excess calcium to the ATP-treated calnexinΔTMC partially restored proteinase K resistance (Fig. 9C, lanes 8 and 9), but, compared with calcium alone (Fig. 9C, lanes 2 and 3), calnexinΔTMC was much more sensitive to proteinase K digestion. Because 10 mM MgCl2 was present in the reaction mixtures, the possibility that ATP effect is as a chelator can be excluded. Hence the Mg-ATP effect on oligomerization can occur in the presence of calcium. Several molecular chaperones bind ATP (14Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Google Scholar), and their function is regulated by ATP (23Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Google Scholar; 11Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Google Scholar). In vivo in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, ATP is required to maintain the interaction of the newly synthesized soluble glycoprotein gp80 with calnexin (33Wada I. Ou W.-J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Google Scholar). We established that purified calnexinΔTMC can bind ATP. Purified calnexinΔTMC was incubated with [α-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of magnesium or calcium, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by radioautography. Binding of ATP was Mg2+-dependent and required UV-enhanced cross-linking (Fig. 10B, lane 4), suggesting that ATP does not form a covalent interaction with the protein and that UV radiation promoted the cross-linking of ATP and the protein. The nucleotides, ATP, ADP, and AMP were all able to compete for binding (Fig. 10C). ATPγS was the most potent competitor for ATP binding. GTP also showed strong inhibition of ATP binding, which has also been observed for other chaperone proteins (9Csermely P. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4943-4950Google Scholar). The reducing reagent, dithiothreitol, strongly inhibited ATP binding, whereas sulfydryl reagents, such as iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide, had little effect on the binding activity, suggesting that the oxidized disulfide bonds in calnexin are required for ATP binding. Using a variety of conditions, which included the presence of denatured proteins, we were unable to detect any ATPase activity in purified calnexinΔTMC. We have shown that calnexin is a type I membrane protein as predicted from its sequence, that the luminal domain can bind in vivo to a secretory glycoprotein, and that the luminal domain and full-length calnexin share several properties. When calnexin was originally identified, it was apparent that it was related by sequence to the major Ca2+-binding protein of the ER lumen, calreticulin (32Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty II, J.-J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Google Scholar). The generation of soluble calnexinΔTMC further extends the similarity to calreticulin (32% identical); we suggest that this is because of the high degree of sequence conservation between calnexinΔTMC and calreticulin that our observations on calnexinΔTMC are also directly applicable to calreticulin. There is evidence from in vivo experiments that calnexin can transiently interact with newly synthesized secretory glycoproteins and membrane proteins during their maturation in the ER. Although there are indications that membrane proteins such as major histocompatibility complex class I can interact with residues within or near the transmembrane domain or even perhaps with the cytosolically directed COOH-terminal domain (22Margolese L. Waneck G.L. Suzuki C.K. Degen E. Flavell R.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17959-17966Google Scholar; 7Capps G.G. Ziga M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11634-11639Google Scholar), it is clear that secretory glycoproteins can only interact with the luminal domain. The orientation of the protein was experimentally determined by peptide-specific antibodies and protease digestion of rough microsomes, confirming that the NH2-terminal domain is in the ER lumen and would interact with substrates. Thus it is probable that this is the region that is responsible for the recognition and molecular chaperone activity for all substrate proteins. We were able to demonstrate by coexpressing the two genes in Sf9 insect cells that, in vivo, this region does interact with the secretory glycoprotein HIV-1 gp120. This was tested by expressing soluble truncated calnexin deleted for the transmembrane and cytosolic domains, calnexinΔTMC, and assessing its interaction with the soluble glycoprotein HIV-1 gp120, a known substrate for full-length calnexin.3 By the criterion of coimmunoprecipitation, newly synthesized gp120 was found to be associated with soluble calnexin. The choice of the Sf9 cell to assess expression of both proteins was especially appropriate because our anti-CN1 antibody did not recognize insect cell calnexin. Hence, the coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated a direct interaction in vivo between calnexinΔTMC and HIV-1 gp120. Although models exist for the interaction of calnexin with its substrates via recognition features in its transmembrane or cytosolic domains (22Margolese L. Waneck G.L. Suzuki C.K. Degen E. Flavell R.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17959-17966Google Scholar; 7Capps G.G. Ziga M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11634-11639Google Scholar), our in vivo data with calnexinΔTMC and HIV-1 gp120 indicate that substrate recognition is luminal as predicted from the studies of 24Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 671-676Google Scholar, 33Wada I. Ou W.-J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Google Scholar, and 19Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Google Scholar. Our studies define the luminal domain as the region responsible for the molecular chaperone activity of calnexin. The secretion from insect cells of calnexinΔTMC and its subsequent ease of purification enabled us to examine that this form of calnexin, which functions as a molecular chaperone, shares other properties with the full-length calnexin. Soluble calnexinΔTMC, when purified from the extracellular medium, was found to be monomeric but to contain at least one intramolecular disulfide bond. All members of the calnexin family from humans to plants reveal sequence conservation about the 4 invariant cysteine residues (Fig. 7). Based on the different mobilities of calnexin in reducing and nonreducing gels, we conclude that at least one potential disulfide bond is formed internally. In the presence of Ca2+, both native calnexin and calnexinΔTMC formed a core structure resistant to proteases. Calcium was required to maintain the core structure because it was destroyed by EGTA. All substrates evaluated by 33Wada I. Ou W.-J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Google Scholar, 34Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Google Scholar required Ca2+ for their association with calnexin. Soluble calnexinΔTMC bound Ca2+, and Ca2+ addition led to the conversion of oligomeric calnexinΔTMC to monomeric calnexinΔTMC. Remarkably, Mg2+ ATP led to the conversion of monomeric calnexinΔTMC to oligomeric calnexinΔTMC. Oligomerization was accompanied by a change in the conformation of individual calnexin molecules as observed by an increased sensitivity to proteinases. The opposite effects of Mg-ATP and Ca2+ in regulating calnexin oligomerization is reminiscent of the inverse effects of these same agents in promoting the association (Ca2+) or dissociation (ATP) of incompletely folded substrate proteins with BiP (29Suzuki C.K. Bonifacino J.S. Lin A.Y. Davis M.M. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 189-205Google Scholar; 13Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7248-7256Google Scholar). 33Wada I. Ou W.-J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Google Scholar demonstrated that ATP is required to maintain the association of the substrate gp80 with calnexin in vivo in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. This observation may now be explained by our demonstration of ATP binding to calnexin and the ATP-dependent conformational change in calnexin. The direct binding of ATP to calnexin in vitro was specific because adenosine nucleotides (e.g. ATP, ADP, AMP, and the ATP analogue ATPγS) were able to compete for binding, binding was Mg2+-dependent, and binding was inhibited by dithiothreitol. However, sulfydryl reagents that reacted with free sulfydryl groups did not affect the ATP binding activity. Hence, we conclude that it is the disulfide bond(s) that act to maintain a specific protein conformation in calnexin competent for binding ATP, and it is not free sulfydryl groups that are involved in ATP binding. The detail in conformational changes of calnexin as related to its substrate binding remains to be studied. However, it is clear that these conformational changes induced by Ca2+ and ATP are relevant to its chaperone function in vivo. The luminal content of Ca2+ in the ER has been estimated to be at concentration of approximately 5 mM (28Somlyo A.P. Bond M. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1985; 314: 622-625Google Scholar), and the translocation of ATP into the ER and its binding to ER proteins have also been documented (8Clairmont C.A. De Maio A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3983-3990Google Scholar). The requirement of both calcium and ATP for the binding of substrate proteins to calnexin suggests that the binding of substrate proteins may accompany conformational changes in calnexin. Another molecular chaperone of the ER, BiP also binds Mg-ATP. Mg-ATP and Ca2+ are also regulatory to BiP function and effect conformational changes in BiP (29Suzuki C.K. Bonifacino J.S. Lin A.Y. Davis M.M. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 189-205Google Scholar; 3Blond-Elguindi S. Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12730-12735Google Scholar; 5Brot N. Redfield B. Qiu N.-H. Chen G.-J. Vidal V. Carlino A. Weissbach H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12120-12124Google Scholar). BiP is a potent ATPase during the step of substrate release from the chaperone (29Suzuki C.K. Bonifacino J.S. Lin A.Y. Davis M.M. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 189-205Google Scholar). Although we have been unable to detect ATPase activity thus far of the purified calnexinΔTMC, this is likely regulated by substrate binding to calnexin and/or an associated protein. Direct binding of purified calnexinΔTMC in vitro with peptides or denatured proteins has only been demonstrated when they are glucosylated with UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase on Man9N-linked glycosylation (25Parodi A.J. Mendelzon D.H. Lederkremer G.Z. Martin-Barrientos J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6351-6357Google Scholar).2 However, ATPase activity can be detected in immunoprecipitates of full-length calnexin with associated secretory glycoproteins.4 4W.-J. Ou, unpublished observations. Hence, the possibility still exists that the presence of a substrate-calnexin interaction is required for ATPase activity or perhaps, more probably, that a calnexin-associated protein may be required for ATPase activity. Good candidates for these protein are the ER membrane proteins that we originally found associated with calnexin (32Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty II, J.-J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Google Scholar). Current models for the actions of several chaperones including the GroEL family and BiP involve a cyclical association and dissociation of protein-folding intermediates with the chaperones correlated with changes in the chaperone quaternary structures regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis (12Freiden P.J. Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 63-70Google Scholar; 3Blond-Elguindi S. Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12730-12735Google Scholar; 30Todd M.J.

One model for chaperone function of calnexin (15Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Google Scholar) proposes that glycoprotein-folding intermediates associated with calnexin undergo a cyclical reglucosylation as the mechanism of cyclical substrate presentation to calnexin. Calnexin and BiP have recently been proposed to act sequentially and cooperate in the folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins in vivo (16Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Google Scholar; 17Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Google Scholar). ATP binding and hydrolysis are likely to regulate the cooperation between calnexin/calreticulin and BiP in protein folding in the ER lumen in vivo.

Analysis of the binding of [3H]ryanodine to these internal vesicles reveals the presence of a single, low affinity binding site with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 200 nM. The second messenger, cyclic ADP-ribose, was found to increase the binding affinity of [3H]ryanodine to its vesicle receptor at least 5-fold (Kd≈ 40 nM). In addition, cADP-ribose appears to be a potent activator of internal Ca2+ release in T-lymphoma cells and is capable of overriding ryanodine-mediated inhibition of internal Ca2+ release.Immunoblot analyses using a monoclonal mouse anti-ryanodine receptor antibody indicate that mouse T-lymphoma cells contain a 500-kDa polypeptide similar to the ryanodine receptor found in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain tissues. Double immunofluorescence staining and laser confocal microscopic analysis show that the ryanodine receptor is preferentially accumulated underneath surface receptor-capped structures.

Further analysis indicates that specific, high affinity binding occurs between ankyrin and this 30 S lymphoma ryanodine receptor (Kd = 0.075 nM). Most importantly, the binding of ankyrin to the light density vesicles significantly blocks ryanodine binding and ryanodine-mediated inhibition of internal Ca2+ release.

These two Ca2+ channels are homotetrameric megaproteins (subunit molecular mass of 500 kDa for the ryanodine receptor and 270 kDa for the IP3 receptor) which share extensive homology in their C-terminal portion where the majority of the transmembrane segments are predicted to be located(2Berridge M.J.

Ryanodine receptors were originally found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle (type 1 receptor, RYR1) and cardiac muscle (type 2 receptor, RYR2)(3Otsu K. Willard H.F. Khanna V.K.

Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The two forms of the ryanodine receptors appear to be encoded by different genes(3Otsu K. Willard H.F. Khanna V.K. Zorzato F.

Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through these receptors plays a central role in regulating the contraction of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers. In vivo, the Ca2+ release channel in skeletal muscle is activated by direct physical coupling to the voltage sensor in the transverse tubule (5Schneider M.F. Chandler W.K. Nature. 1973; 242: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 6Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) while the cardiac Ca2+ channel is activated by Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane-associated Ca2+ channels(7Fabiato A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 89: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Nabauer M. Callewaert G. Cleeman L. Morad M. Science. 1989; 244: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Recently, a third ryanodine receptor gene (type 3 receptor, RYR3) has been detected in brain tissues(9Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Since this new isoform of RYR is also found in smooth muscle tissue and several types of non-muscle cells(4Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 9Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K.

Science. 1992; 257: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the concept that ryanodine receptors are muscle-specific Ca2+ channels must be changed. Furthermore, it has been suggested that activation of ryanodine receptors by a second messenger (e.g. cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)) plays a critical role in intracellular Ca2+ signaling occurring during agonist-induced cell activation in non-muscle cells(11Takasawa S. Nata K. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Science. 1993; 259: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 12States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Non-muscle cells, such as mouse T-lymphoma cells, may possess a specialized sarcoplasmic reticulum-like organelle required for regulating internal Ca2+ release. It has been shown that IP3 is involved in stimulating “light density vesicles” in mouse T-lymphoma cells to release Ca2+(13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent cloning and cDNA sequence analysis show that the brain type of ryanodine receptor (RYR3) transcript is expressed in human Jurkat T-lymphocyte cells(14Hakamata Y. Nishimura S. Nakai J. Nakashima Y. Kita T. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, direct biochemical evidence for the existence of a non-muscle ryanodine receptor (with a separate type of intracellular Ca2+-release channel) in lymphoid cells has not been reported. In this paper, we have isolated and partially characterized a mouse T-lymphoma ryanodine receptor from a type of internal vesicle which bands at the relatively light density of 1.07 g/ml. Immunoblot analyses using a monoclonal mouse anti-ryanodine receptor antibody indicate that mouse T-lymphoma cells contain a 500-kDa polypeptide similar to the ryanodine receptor found in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain tissues. Most importantly, we have determined that ankyrin (a membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein) binds specifically to the mouse T-lymphoma ryanodine receptor, and that this binding significantly inhibits ryanodine binding to ryanodine receptor and blocks ryanodine-mediated inhibition of internal Ca2+ release. These results strongly suggest that the interaction between ryanodine receptor and ankyrin may play an important role in the regulation of internal Ca2+ release during lymphocyte activation. [3H]Ryanodine (specific activity 54.7 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. 45CaCl2 (specific activity 5-30 Ci/g) was obtained from ICN. cADPR was purchased from Amersham. The mouse T-lymphoma BW 5147 cell line (an AKR/J lymphoma line) was grown at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heatinactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. The cells (suspended in 50 ml of ice-cold buffer consisting of 15 mM KCl, 1.5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0)) were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation in an Artisan homogenizer (Artisan Industries, Inc., Waltham, MA) held at 0°C using a pressure of 600 p.s.i. for 15 min. After disruption, one-tenth volume of 700 mM KCl, 40 mM Mg(OAc)2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 400 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM PMSF was added, and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × gav for 4 min. The resulting supernatant was layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 0%, 15%, 25%, 35%, 40%, 50% sucrose (w/w) in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM PMSF. The gradient was centrifuged in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 16 h as described previously(13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranous materials located in various sucrose layers were collected for further biochemical analyses including enzyme marker assays, ryanodine binding assays, Ca2+ flux measurement, and immunoblotting techniques as described below. Na+/K+-ATPase activity was used as a specific enzyme marker for plasma membrane(15Monneron A. D'Alayer J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 27: 211-231Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Bourguignon G.J.

Galactosyltransferase activity, which was used as a Golgi marker, was assayed according to the procedures described previously(19Goldberg D.E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3159-3165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-N-Acylglucosaminidase was used as a lysosomal marker(20Bourguignon L.Y.W. Balazovich K. Suchard S.J. Hindgaul O. Pierce M.

Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit. Mouse T-lymphoma cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and resuspended in the same medium. Fluorescein-conjugated concanavalin A (FITC-Con A) (20 μg/ml) was added directly to the cell suspension at 0°C for 30 min. Cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium three times followed by incubation at 37°C for 15 min to induce patched or capped structures. Cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). In some cases, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde without pretreatment with fluorescein isothiocyanate-ConA. Subsequently, fixed cells were either rendered permeable by 90% ethanol or without any ethanol permeabilization followed by staining with an affinity-purified monoclonal mouse anti-ryanodine receptor antibody (RYR.1, it was raised against the C terminus cytoplasmic domain of the ryanodine receptor). These samples were then labeled with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. To detect nonspecific antibody binding, cells were incubated with normal mouse serum followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. No staining was observed in such control samples. Fluorescence-labeled samples were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (MultiProbe 2001 Inverted CLSM system, Molecular Dynamics). Electrophoresis was conducted using a 5% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE slab gel and the discontinuous buffer system described by Laemmli(22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204082) Google Scholar). For autoradiographic analysis, all gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to Kodak x-ray film (X-Omat XAR-5). Human erythrocyte ankyrin was purified by the procedure of Bennett and Stenbuck(23Bennett V. Stenbuck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2540-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphoma light density vesicles (isolated from the 15-25% sucrose interface according to the procedures described above) were incubated in a solution containing 20 mM Tris-HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl, 0.2 mM PMSF, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 5 μg of aprotinin, 5 μg of leupeptin, and 10 nM [3H]ryanodine in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled ryanodine (ranging from 50 nM-100 μM) for 16 h at 4°C. Total Ca2+ concentration in the solution was monitored by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Perkin-Elmer model 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with a Perkin-Elmer HGA500 graphite furnace. A computer program, taking into account pH, Ca2+, and K+, was used to calculate the concentration of EGTA needed to adjust the free Ca2+ concentration. In some cases, either cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) (1-3 μM) or cytoskeletal proteins (e.g. ankyrin (10 μg/ml) or fodrin (10 μg/ml)) was also included in the ryanodine binding solution. The binding reaction was terminated by adding a solution containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EGTA and filtrating through a Millipore filter (HAWP, 0.45 μm). The filter-associated radioactivity was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. The results were expressed as “specific binding” in which the nonspecific binding (defined as the radioactivity associated with samples and the filter in the presence of 10-4M unlabeled ryanodine) was subtracted from the total [3H]ryanodine binding. The background represents approximately 20% of the total [3H]ryanodine binding activity. Membranes (e.g. mouse lymphoma light density vesicles, rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, rat cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, and rat brain membrane vesicles) were solubilized in a solution containing 1 M NaCl solution, 20 mM MOPS, 0.25% CHAPS/phosphatidylcholine (10:1), and protease inhibitors, a modified procedure from a previous report (24Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.-Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Solubilized proteins were centrifuged on 5-30% linear sucrose density gradients in a Beckman SW50 for 16 h at 100,000 × gav. Gradient fractions were analyzed by postlabeling with [3H]ryanodine which involves an incubation of various gradient fractions in a solution containing 20 mM Tris-HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl, 0.2 mM PMSF, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 5 μg of aprotinin, 5 μg of leupeptin, and 10 nM [3H]ryanodine in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled ryanodine (ranging from 50 nM-100 μM) for 16 h at 4°C. To determine [3H]ryanodine binding, the individual fraction was applied onto a small (1-ml) Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated in a solution containing 1 M NaCl, 20 mM MOPS, 0.25% CHAPS/phosphatidylcholine, and protease inhibitors. The Sephadex G-50 eluent (i.e. [3H]ryanodine-bound material) was collected by low speed centrifugation (500 × gav), and the radioactivity was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Ankyrin was labeled with Na125I using IODOBEADS. 125I-Ankyrin (50 ng) was incubated with a nitrocellulose sheet coated with purified ryanodine receptors (30 S molecule obtained from lymphoma light density vesicles, skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, or brain membrane vesicles according to the procedures described above) in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled ankyrin (ranging from 0.01 nM-1.00 μM) in a binding solution containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 16 h at 4°C. Following incubation, the nitrocellulose sheets were washed 5 times with the same binding solution and counted in a γ counter. The results were expressed as specific binding in which the background level of binding was subtracted. As a control, we removed ryanodine receptors by incubating the 30 S peak fraction with anti-ryanodine receptor antibody-conjugated Sephadex beads. No specific ankyrin binding was detected in these ryanodine receptor-free samples. 45Ca2+ fluxes were studied in a reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris-HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mM KCl, 0.2 mM PMSF, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 5 μg of aprotinin and 5 μg of leupeptin, 1 mM45CaCl2 in the presence or absence of various concentrations of ryanodine (10-100 μM) overnight. In some cases, either cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) (1-3 μM) or ankyrin (10 μg/ml) was also included in the reaction medium in which the free Ca2+ was preadjusted to 0.1 μM. The Ca2+ efflux was quenched by the addition of 5 mM LaCl3. The amount of Ca2+ released from the light density vesicles was determined by a filtration method using Millipore filters (HAWP, 0.45 μm) and washing with a buffer containing 120 mM KCl and 20 mM Tris-HEPES (pH 7.2). The filter-associated radioactivity was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Protein samples including purified lymphoma 30 S molecule, lymphoma light density vesicles (collected from 15-25% sucrose interface), lymphoma total cellular proteins, rabbit skeletal muscle membranes, rat cardiac muscle membranes, and rat brain membrane vesicles were analyzed by a 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transferring to nitrocellulose sheets. Ryanodine receptor-related immunoreactive proteins were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence method using a 1:600 dilution of an affinity-purified monoclonal mouse anti-ryanodine receptor antibody (RYR.1) (1 mg/ml) and a 1:7000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rat IgG (1 mg/ml) (Amersham) followed by exposure to Kodak XAR-5 film. Normal mouse serum was used as a control. It is well known that Ca2+ plays an important role in the regulation of a large number of cellular activities including lymphocyte receptor capping(25Bourguignon L.Y.W. Bourguignon G.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1884; 87: 195-224Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration following the addition of ligand (or agonist) results from either Ca2+ release from intracellular storage vesicles or exchange with extracellular Ca2+(2Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6109) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that an IP3 receptor-gated Ca2+ channel is involved in the internal Ca2+ release in mouse T-lymphoma cells(13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study reports that lymphocytes contain a brain-type ryanodine receptor transcript which appears to be involved in T-cell function(14Hakamata Y. Nishimura S. Nakai J. Nakashima Y. Kita T. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical properties and regulatory aspects of this ryanodine receptor have not been determined. In order to characterize the lymphocyte ryanodine receptor, we have carried out the following subcellular localization experiments. First, mouse T-lymphoma cells were homogenized by nitrogen cavitation, and vesicle populations were fractionated by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation (i.e. 0%, 15%, 25%, 35%, 40%, and 50% sucrose) (Table 1). Enzyme marker analyses (13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that the major organelle membranes (e.g. Golgi membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomal membranes, and other large particles (e.g. membrane-bound ribosomes)) are located at the 25-35% sucrose interface (fraction C), the 35-45% sucrose interface (fraction D), and the 40-50% sucrose interface (fraction E) (Table 1). Mouse T-lymphoma ryanodine binding sites, however, are preferentially located in the light density vesicle fraction at the 15-25% sucrose interface-fraction B (Table 1). In this paper we have focused on the ryanodine binding sites detected in the light density vesicles (fraction B with a density of approximately 1.07 g/ml) (Table 1). The fact that the mouse T-lymphoma IP3 receptor is also found in this light density vesicle fraction (13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that either the two types of receptors are located in different vesicle populations which share similar isopycnic (density) points, or both the ryanodine receptor and the IP3 receptor are located on the same vesicles. The relationship between the ryanodine receptor and the IP3 receptor in mouse T-lymphoma cells is currently under investigation. The affinity of [3H]ryanodine for the light density vesicles was measured in binding inhibition experiments using increasing concentrations of unlabeled ryanodine. The displacement curve reveals the presence of a single low affinity ryanodine binding site with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 200 ± 10 nM (Fig. 1). This Kd is similar to that for the low affinity sites found on skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (4Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 26Carroll S. Skarmeta J.G. Yu X. Collins K.D. Inesi G. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20974-20982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reported to be associated with inhibition of Ca2+ channel activity(4Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 28McGrew S.G. Wolleben C. Siegl P. Inui M. Fleischer S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1686-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The high affinity ryanodine binding site (Kd≈ 2-5 nM) locks ryanodine receptors into an open state upon binding of ryanodine in both skeletal (1Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and cardiac (1Coronado R.

Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) muscles. This high affinity ryanodine binding site was not detected in resting (unstimulated) mouse T-lymphoma cells. In nonexcitable cells, most extracellular signals activate Ca2+ release from internal stores through the production of the second messenger, IP3(2Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6109) Google Scholar). Recent studies on Ca2+ mobilization, however, suggest that second messengers other than IP3 may be involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A likely candidate for such as second messenger is cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a metabolite of NAD, which has been shown to be a potent activator of internal Ca2+ release in sea urchins (29Galione A. White A. Willmott N. Turner M. Potter B.V.L. Watson S.P. Nature. 1993; 365: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 30Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a modulator of the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release in both cardiac and brain microsomes(31Meszaros L. Bak J. Chu A. Nature. 1993; 364: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Activation of ryanodine receptors by cADPR is modulated by calmodulin which serves as an inhibitor for internal Ca2+ release(32Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Gurnack M.E. Walseth T.F. Nature. 1994; 370: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) increases the binding affinity of [3H]ryanodine to its receptor at least 5-fold (Kd≈ 40 nM) (Fig. 1). It is possible that low affinity ryanodine binding sites are normally expressed in the resting (unstimulated) lymphoid cells. These low affinity ryanodine binding sites may then be converted into higher affinity ryanodine binding sites when a second messenger, such as cADPR, is formed during lymphocyte activation by agonists. It has been shown that both cADPR and its breakdown product, ADP-ribose, are capable of influencing the Ca2+ release channel(33Sitsapesan R. McGarry S.J. Williams A.J. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 596-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we cannot rule out the possibility that cADPR and/or ADP-ribose are responsible for the increase of the Kd of [3H]ryanodine binding. We have also found that the light density vesicles display Ca2+ release activities (Table 2) which can be selectively inhibited by ryanodine. These findings suggest that (i) the mouse T-lymphoma cells' light density vesicles contain a ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channel (Tables I, II, and Fig. 6, panel 1), (ii) the cADPR is a potent activator of internal Ca2+ release; and (iii) cADPR-mediated activation is not inhibited by ryanodine (Table 2). Presently, the mode of action of cADPR in regulating Ca2+ channel activity is not fully established. It is speculated that cADPR displays stimulatory effects on both ryanodine-sensitive and ryanodine-insensitive Ca2+ channel activities. Inhibition of cADPR-stimulated ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+channels by ryanodine may be overridden by the extensive cADPR stimulation on ryanodine-insensitive Ca2+channels under our assay conditions. This hypothesis is currently under investigation in our laboratory. It is noteworthy that a similar overriding of ryanodine inhibition of internal Ca2+ release by cADPR has also been reported to occur in cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum and brain vesicles(31Meszaros L. Bak J. Chu A. Nature. 1993; 364: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Some studies also indicate that cADPR does not act as a direct endogenous activator of Ca2+ release activity associated with the skeletal or cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor(33Sitsapesan R. McGarry S.J. Williams A.J. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 596-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Shomer N.H. Velez P. Louis C.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Structurally, the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) and the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RYR2) are different from the brain and lymphoma ryanodine receptor (RYR3). It is possible that: (i) cADPR displays high affinity binding with RYR3 but has a low binding affinity with RYR1 and RYR2 or (ii) the binding affinity for cADPR to RYR3 may be higher than that in RYR1 and RYR1. The effective interaction between cADPR and RYR3 (but not RYR1/RYR2) may activate Ca2+ release channels only in RYR3-containing tissues and cells. A systematic analysis of cADPR binding to the three types of ryanodine receptors (i.e. RYR1, RYR2, and RYR3) is needed to test this hypothesis. Extraction of the light density vesicles with CHAPS in 1 M NaCl, followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation and postlabeling with [3H]ryanodine, yields a single peak with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 30 S, similar to the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (Fig. 2A). SDS-PAGE analysis followed by silver staining of the 30 S peak material reveals a single polypeptide (molecular mass of ≈500 kDa) (Fig. 2B). Using immunoblotting techniques, we have found that the monoclonal anti-ryanodine receptor antibody (RYR.1) recognizes a single polypeptide (with a molecular mass of ≈500 kDa) present among all lymphoma cellular proteins (Fig. 3, E and F). This antibody also binds the ryanodine receptor (Fig. 3D) isolated from skeletal muscle (Fig. 3A), cardiac muscle (Fig. 3B), brain tissues (Fig. 3C), and the lymphoma 30 S peak fraction (Fig. 3D). These findings clearly indicate that mouse T-lymphoma cells do, in fact, contain ryanodine receptors. In Fig. 4, we have shown that if the cells were prefixed with 2% formaldehyde, without being permeabilized by ethanol treatment, no anti-ryanodine receptor-mediated staining can be detected (Fig. 4A). This finding suggests that ryanodine receptor is not located on the surface membrane of mouse T-lymphoma cells. When cells (in the absence of any external ligand challenge) were fixed with 2% formaldehyde followed by ethanol permeabilization and anti-ryanodine receptor-mediated staining, intracellular ryanodine receptors are found to be localized around the periphery of the cell and the perinucleus region of the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B). Importantly, if cells were treated with an external ligand such as concanavalin A (ConA), the intracellular ryanodine receptors (Fig. 4, D and F) become preferentially associated with surface receptor-patched (Fig. 4C) and -capped (Fig. 4E) structures. Since ConA is known to be involved in T cell-mediated lymphocyte activation and mitogenesis(35Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jy W. Majercik M.H. Bourguignon G.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 37: 131-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), these results suggest that ryanodine receptor could be critically important for internal Ca2+ release at the onset of receptor capping and lymphocyte activation. Cytoskeletal proteins are included in the array of cellular elements which underlie and interact with cellular membranes (plasma membrane and/or internal vesicle membranes). It is believed that the formation of a direct connection between the cytoskeleton and certain membrane proteins is one of the earliest events to occur during signal transduction(36Bourguignon L.Y.W. Roitt I.M. Delves P.J. Encyclopedia of Immunology. Academic Press, New York1992: 1044-1046Google Scholar). In fact, a number of cytoskeletal proteins, which are analogs of the major erythrocyte membrane skeleton proteins (e.g. ankyrin, fodrin (a spectrin-like protein), and band 4.1-like protein), are found to be involved in transmitting regulatory signals during cell activation by agonists(37Bennett V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Ankyrin is a cytoskeletal protein known to be linked to certain membrane proteins, such as erythrocyte band 3 (37Bennett V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and lymphocyte GP85(CD44)(38Kalomiris E.L. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Biol.

In addition, ankyrin has been found to bind to the IP3 receptor in brain tissue (43Joseph S.K. Samanta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6477-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lymphoma cells(13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N. Zhang S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the binding of ankyrin to the IP3 receptor modulates IP3 binding and internal Ca2+ release(13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In order to determine the binding interaction between lymphoma ryanodine receptor and the cytoskeletal proteins such as ankyrin, we have incubated lymphoma 30 S ryanodine receptor-coated nitrocellulose sheets with 125I-ankyrin in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled ankyrin (Fig. 5A). Our data indicate that specific, high affinity binding occurs between ankyrin and this lymphoma 30 S ryanodine receptor (Kd = 0.075 nM) (Fig. 5A). In addition, we have shown that the binding of 125I-ankyrin to various 30 S ryanodine receptors isolated from skeletal muscle (Fig. 5B, a), cardiac muscle (Fig. 5B, c), and brain tissue (Fig. 5B, e) is also specific because 100-fold excess soluble unlabeled ankyrin can successfully compete with 125I-ankyrin binding to these ryanodine receptors (Fig. 5B, b, d, and f). These data suggest that the amino acid sequence of the ankyrin binding domain on various ryanodine receptors must be highly conserved among different cell types and tissues. Recently, we have shown that an 11-amino-acid synthetic peptide derived from sequence comparisons between two ankyrin binding proteins (CD44 and IP3 receptor) inhibit the binding of ankyrin to mouse lymphoma IP3 receptor(44Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Preliminary data indicate that this 11-amino acid synthetic peptide (containing the ankyrin binding domain) also blocks ankyrin binding to purified lymphoma 30 S ryanodine receptor with an apparent inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.25 nM. Most importantly, the binding of ankyrin (but not fodrin) to the ryanodine receptor in the light density vesicles also significantly inhibits ryanodine binding (Table 3) and blocks the inhibitory effect of ryanodine on internal Ca2+ release (Fig. 6, panel 2). Therefore, it is possible that ankyrin binding competes or overlaps with ryanodine binding sites. This may explain ankyrin's overriding effect on ryanodine-mediated inhibition of internal Ca2+ release in these vesicles (Fig. 6, panel 2). Alternatively, ankyrin binding may cause some conformational change in the regulatory domain(s) of ryanodine receptor resulting in a decrease in ryanodine binding as well as a reduction in the potency of ryanodine inhibition of internal Ca2+ release. The fact that ankyrin also modulates IP3 binding and IP3-mediated Ca2+ release in mouse T-lymphoma cells (13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Bourguignon L.Y.W. Jin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that ankyrin is one of the important molecules regulating Ca2+ signaling. Currently, we are using in vitro mutagenesis and deletion mutation techniques to further define the ankyrin binding domain(s) on the mouse T-lymphoma ryanodine receptor. In conclusion, our findings support the notion that mouse T-lymphoma cells contain ryanodine receptors which function as a second intracellular Ca2+ release channel along with the IP3 receptors. Most importantly, we believe that both cADPR and the cytoskeletal protein, ankyrin, play a pivotal role in the regulation of ryanodine-sensitive channel-mediated internal Ca2+ release during lymphocyte activation.

https://openalex.org/W2051691998,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with dysfunctional mitochondria, such as in petites, the CIT2 gene encoding the peroxisomal glyoxylate cycle enzyme, citrate synthase 2 (CS2), is transcriptionally activated by as much as 30-fold, a phenomenon we call retrograde regulation. Two genes, RTG1 and RTG2, are required for both basal and elevated expression of CIT2 (Liao, X., and Butow, R. A.(1993) Cell 72, 61-71). Different blocks in the tricarboxylic acid cycle also elicit an increase in CIT2 expression, but not to the extent observed in petites. We have examined whether other genes of the glyoxylate cycle exhibit retrograde regulation and the role of RTG1 and RTG2 in their expression. Of the glyoxylate cycle genes tested, CIT2 is the only one that shows retrograde regulation, suggesting that CS2 may be an important control point for metabolic cross-feeding from the glyoxylate cycle to mitochondria. Surprisingly, RTG1 and RTG2 are required for efficient growth of cells on medium containing oleic acid, a condition which induces peroxisome biogenesis; these genes are also required together for oleic acid induction of three peroxisomal protein genes tested, POX1 and CTA1 involved β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids and PMP27, which encodes the most abundant protein of peroxisomal membranes. These data indicate that, in addition to their role in retrograde regulation of CIT2, the RTG genes are important for expression of genes encoding peroxisomal proteins and are thus key components in a novel, three-way path of communication between mitochondria, the nucleus, and peroxisomes.

It has recently become clear that alterations in the functional state of mitochondria and chloroplasts can result in changes in nuclear gene expression(1Susek R.E. Ausubel F.M. Chory J.

We have called this pathway of interorganelle communication retrograde regulation and suggested that it is a mechanism for the cell to adjust to changes in mitochondrial or chloroplast activities(10Shyjan A.W. Butow R.A. Current Biol. 1993; 3: 398-400Google Scholar). One example in yeast that supports the idea that retrograde regulation is an adaptive process to changes in mitochondrial function is the dramatic elevation in expression of the CIT2 gene in cells with altered mitochondrial activity(5Liao X. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Google Scholar). CIT2 is a nuclear gene encoding the glyoxylate cycle isoform of citrate synthase (CS2)(11Rosenkrantz M. Alam T. Kim K.-S. Clark B.J. Srere P.A. Guarente L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4509-4515Google Scholar); that enzyme, together with other enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, is located in peroxisomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae(12Lewin A.S. Hines V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1399-1405Google Scholar, 13McCammon M.T. Veenhuis M. Trapp S.B. Goodman J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5816-5827Google Scholar). CIT2 expression is increased 5-10 fold in cells in which the tricarboxylic acid cycle is blocked because of a disruption of CIT1, the gene encoding the mitochondrial isoform of citrate synthase, CS1(14Suissa M. Suda K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1773-1781Google Scholar). This increase in CIT2 expression compensates for the loss of CS1 activity through metabolic cross-feeding between the glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycles(5Liao X. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Google Scholar). The greatest increase in CIT2 expression we have observed is in respiratory-deficient ρ0 petites, which lack mitochondrial DNA. In those cells, the CIT2 mRNA abundance is as much as 30-fold greater than in their isochromosomal respiratory-competent (ρ+) counterparts. The increased abundance of CIT2 mRNA in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria is due to transcriptional activation and is mediated in cis through an upstream activation site (UASr) in the 5’ flanking region of the gene(5Liao X. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Google Scholar, 6Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Google Scholar). We previously reported that transcriptional regulation of CIT2 requires at least two trans acting factors encoded by the single copy nuclear genes, RTG1 and RTG2(6Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Google Scholar). RTG1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that binds to the CIT2 UASr, while RTG2 encodes a protein of unknown function that probably acts indirectly in the transactivation of CIT2 expression. A recent report shows that the deduced sequence of the RTG2-encoded protein has an ATP binding domain with similarity to bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze the transcriptional regulators, ppGpp and pppGpp(15Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 156-157Google Scholar). We have recently identified a third gene (RTG3) required for CIT2 expression1 1Y. Jia, J. Etheredge, B. Rothermel, and R. A. Butow, unpublished results. 1Y. Jia, J. Etheredge, B. Rothermel, and R. A. Butow, unpublished results. whose properties will be reported elsewhere. The products of both RTG1 and RTG2 are required not only for the elevated expression of CIT2 in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria but also for its basal expression in otherwise wild-type cells. Although neither RTG1 nor RTG2 are essential genes, cells with mutant alleles of either are glutamate-aspartate auxotrophs and are unable to grow on acetate as a sole carbon source. These growth requirements are characteristic of cells with blocks in both the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles, suggesting that the RTG genes play a role in the regulation of both(11Rosenkrantz M. Alam T. Kim K.-S. Clark B.J. Srere P.A. Guarente L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4509-4515Google Scholar). As yet, we have not found any significant lesions in enzymes of either cycle, other than the expected absence of CS2 activity and a reduction (~50%) in CS1 activity, which could account in any simple way for the rtg mutant phenotypes(16Small W.C. Brodeur R.D. Sandor A. Fedorova N. Li G. Butow R.A. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5569-5576Google Scholar). These findings raise a number of questions regarding retrograde regulation and other possible functions of the RTG genes. For example, do tricarboxylic acid cycle blocks, other than a loss of CS1 activity, result in elevated CIT2 expression? Are other genes encoding glyoxylate cycle enzymes subject to retrograde regulation? And what role, if any, do the RTG genes play in expression of other peroxisomal proteins? This latter issue can be conveniently studied in yeast by growing cells in medium containing oleic acid. Under these conditions, there is a large induction of peroxisomal enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway accompanied by a general increase in the number of peroxisomes within the cell(17Kunau W.-H. Bhne S. del la Garza M. Kionka C. Mateblowski M. Schultz-Borchard U. Thieringer R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 418-420Google Scholar, 18Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Google Scholar, 19Skoneczny S. Chelstowska A. Rytka J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 297-302Google Scholar). Here we show that a tricarboxylic acid cycle block caused by a disruption of MDH1 (encoding the tricarboxylic acid cycle isoform of malate dehydrogenase) elicits an elevation of CIT2 expression similar to that observed in cells with a disruption of CIT1. We show further that CIT2 is the only gene encoding a glyoxylate cycle enzyme among three others tested that is subject to significant retrograde regulation when its expression is compared between isochromosomal ρ+ and ρ0 cells. Finally, we show that RTG1 and RTG2 are required for full induction of expression of genes encoding other peroxisomal proteins, including an abundant protein associated with peroxisomal membranes whose synthesis follows peroxisome biogenesis (20Marshall P.A. Krimkevich Y.I. Lark R.H. Dyer J.M. Veenhuis M. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 345-355Google Scholar, 21Erdman R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 509-523Google Scholar) when cells are grown in medium containing oleic acid. Thus, the RTG genes function not only in communication between mitochondria and the nucleus, but are likely to be involved in the oleic acid induction of peroxisome biogenesis as well. Yeast strains used in this study were COP161U7 (MATa, ade1 lys1 ura3 ρ+) and ethidium bromide-induced (see below) ρ0 isolates. Derivatives of ρ+ and ρ0 isolates were made containing URA3 insertion mutations in RTG1 (Δrtg1), RTG2 (Δrtg2), or in both chromosomal loci (Δrtg1 Δrtg2) as described by Liao and Butow(6Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Google Scholar). Strain PSY142 (MATα, leu2 lys2, ura3 ρ+) and its cit1 disruption derivative (cit1::LEU2) was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Srere. To construct a disruption of MDH1 in PSY142, 30-mer PCR2 2The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s). primers were made containing 21 bp homologous to MDH1 sequence from position −144 to −124 at the 5’ end of a gene and from position +1187 to +1207 at the 3’ end of the gene(22Thompson L.M. Sutherland P. Steffan J.S. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8393-8400Google Scholar); the remaining 9 bp of each primer contained restriction site sequences for BamHI (5’) and SalI (3’). The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI-SalI sites of Bluescript KS plasmid. A 735-bp HindIII-EcoRI internal fragment of MDH1 was replaced by a 1170-bp HindIII restriction fragment containing the URA3 gene after filling protruding 5’ ends with Klenow enzyme. The mdh1::URA3 fragment was excised from the above plasmid and used to transform ρ+ PSY142 by a one-step transformation procedure(23Chen D.-C. Yang B.-C. Kuo T.-T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Google Scholar). The disruption allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Various ρ0 derivatives of these strains were generated by growing cells to saturation in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 1% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose) supplemented with 25 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The cells were diluted 1:50 and grown once more in the same medium to stationary phase. Individual colonies were checked by 4’,6’-diamino-2-phenylindole staining for the loss of mitochondrial DNA. polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) kilobase(s). Yeast strains were grown at 30°C on YPR medium (1% yeast extract, 1% Bacto-peptone, and 2% raffinose) additionally supplemented with adenine (50 mg/liter). Solid medium contained 2% agar. For oleic acid induction experiments, oleic acid (>99% purity, Aldrich) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v) while shaking vigorously to obtain an even emulsion. For most analyses, cells were harvested by centrifugation at midlogarithmic phase of growth, usually at an A600 between 0.9 and 1.1. Total yeast RNA was isolated from 50 ml of culture as described by Schmitt et al.(24Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Google Scholar). RNA was aliquoted and stored at −80°C. For Northern blot analysis of mRNA abundance, 2.5-20 μg of RNA was separated on a 1.3% agarose gel containing 6.4% formaldehyde by electrophoresis for 12-14 h at room temperature. The fractionated RNAs were transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by capillary blotting in 20 × SSC (0.15 M NaCl, 0.15 M sodium citrate) and cross-linked to the membrane. Hybridizations were performed using Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prehybridization was carried out for 1 h at 65°C. Radiolabeled probes were added and hybridized for 2-3 h at 65°C. 32P-Labeled DNA probes for hybridization were prepared by the random priming method using the Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) or by PCR labeling using a PCR Radioactive Labeling System (Life Technologies, Inc.). [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) was used for generating radioactive probes. Blots were washed twice in 2 × SSC and once in 0.4 × SSC at 65°C, briefly air-dried, and exposed in PhosphorImager cassettes (Molecular Dynamics) or on Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham). For quantitative Northern analysis, 2- to 8-fold serial dilutions of RNA samples were loaded on to the gel. Autoradiograms were quantified against the levels of actin mRNA, whose abundance does not vary with growth conditions or among the various strain derivatives(4Parikh V.S. Morgan M.M. Scott R. Clements L.S. Butow R.A. Science. 1987; 235: 576-580Google Scholar), with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software. Radioactive probes for the analysis of mRNA abundance of the various genes analyzed in this study generated by random priming (25Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar) include the following restriction endonuclease fragments: ACT1 (actin), 0.6-kb ClaI internal fragment from plasmid pGEM-actin(26Ng R. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3912-3916Google Scholar); CIT2 (CS2), 1.1-kb SpeI-NcoI internal fragment from plasmid pGCIT2-1083(5Liao X. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Google Scholar); CTA1 (catalase A), 2.8-kb EcoRI fragment containing the coding and both 5’- and 3’-untranslated regions (27Cohen G. Rapatz W. Ruis H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 159-163Google Scholar); PMP27 (peroxisomal membrane protein), 0.8-kb XbaI-BamHI fragment from plasmid PMP27-pUC19 (20Marshall P.A. Krimkevich Y.I. Lark R.H. Dyer J.M. Veenhuis M. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 345-355Google Scholar) containing 0.6 kb of coding sequence and 0.2 kb of 3’-untranslated region of PMP27. MDH1 (malate dehydrogenase 1), coding sequence with flanking regions amplified from position −144 to +1207(22Thompson L.M. Sutherland P. Steffan J.S. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8393-8400Google Scholar); MDH3 (malate dehydrogenase 3), internal fragment amplified from position +91 to +981(28Steffan J.S. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24708-24715Google Scholar); ICL1 (isocitrate lyase), internal fragment amplified from position +529 to +1512(29Fernandez E. Moreno F. Rodicio R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 983-990Google Scholar); MLS1 (malate synthase 1), internal fragment amplified from position +533 to +1644(30Hartig A. Simon M.M. Schuster T. Daugherty J.R. Yoo H.S. Cooper T.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5677-5686Google Scholar); POX1 (acyl-CoA oxidase), internal fragment amplified from position +828 to +1764(31Dmochowska A. Dignard D. Maleszka R. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 247-252Google Scholar). For these reactions, 1 μg of yeast genomic DNA, isolated as described in (32Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), was used as a template in each PCR reaction. Primers used in all PCR reactions were synthetic 21-mers. PCR products were obtained using a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). Thirty cycles with the following profile were performed: 30 s at 94°C, 2 min at 50°C, and 2 min at 72°C. PCR products were subsequently separated in 0.8% agarose and gel-purified using a Geneclean Kit (Bio 101, Inc.). The purified PCR products were used next as a template in labeling reactions by PCR or random priming as noted above. The response of CIT2 gene expression to dysfunctional mitochondria is readily observed in a comparison of the abundance of CIT2 mRNA in ρ+versus ρ0 cells. In a typical Northern blot of total cellular RNA from ρ+ and ρ0 cells of strain PSY142, CIT2 mRNA is 25 times more abundant in the ρ0 derivative compared with ρ+ cells (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2) when both strains are grown on rich raffinose medium. A less severe alteration in mitochondrial function can also result in an increase in CIT2 expression; for example, in ρ+ cells that have a disruption of the CIT1 gene. As shown in Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4, CIT2 mRNA abundance is 10-fold greater in ρ+cit1::URA3 cells than in the wild-type. One possibility to account for this increase in CIT2 expression is that it is a specific response to the absence of any mitochondrial CS1 activity, a plausible notion considering the metabolic cross-feeding of citrate generated in the glyoxylate cycle from peroxisomes to mitochondria(33Tolbert N.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 133-157Google Scholar). To examine this point, we have measured CIT2 mRNA levels in ρ+ cells with a different lesion in the tricarboxylic acid cycle generated by a disruption of MDH1, the gene encoding the mitochondrial isoform of malate dehydrogenase(22Thompson L.M. Sutherland P. Steffan J.S. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8393-8400Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6, ρ+ cells with an MDH1 disruption also have elevated levels of CIT2 mRNA, which in this experiment is 6.5-fold greater than the wild-type ρ+ control. This result rules out the possibility that increased expression of CIT2 is the result of a defect in the tricarboxylic acid cycle specifically involving the CIT1 gene. The finding that the abundance of CIT2 mRNA is greater in petites (which lack an electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation apparatus) than in ρ+ cells which lack tricarboxylic acid cycle activity suggests that multiple lesions in mitochondrial function may account for the high levels of CIT2 expression in petites. This view is consistent with a previous observation that the abundance of CIT2 mRNA in ρ+ cells with a CIT1 disruption can be further increased to the level observed in petites if the cells are grown in the presence of the respiratory chain inhibitor, antimycin A(5Liao X. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that increases in CIT2 expression can be induced, probably cumulatively, by a variety of blocks in mitochondrial function. Given the metabolic interplay between the glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycles(33Tolbert N.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 133-157Google Scholar), a key question is whether the expression of other glyoxylate cycle genes besides CIT2 respond to the functional state of mitochondria. To examine this, we have compared the mRNA levels in ρ+ and ρ0 derivatives of strain COP161U7 for three additional glyoxylate cycle genes, ICL1 (isocitrate lyase), MLSI (malate synthase), and MDH3 (malate dehydrogenase 3). Northern blots of total RNA isolated from these cells were hybridized with probes specific for each of these genes as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legend to Fig. 2. The results of these experiments (Fig. 2) show that of these genes, only CIT2 is subject to significant retrograde regulation. In this experiment, the CIT2 mRNA abundance is 10-fold greater in the ρ0 petite than in ρ+ cells, whereas the mRNA levels for MLSI and MDH3 are no greater than 2-fold. The probe used for ICL1, which is a 983-bp fragment derived by PCR from the coding region of the gene (see “Experimental Procedures”), hybridizes about equally to two closely migrating transcripts, neither of which shows a retrograde response. Thus, at this level of analysis, clearly not all glyoxylate cycle genes are subject to retrograde regulation. RTG1 and RTG2 are required for both basal expression of CIT2 in wild-type cells and for its elevated expression in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria(6Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Google Scholar). A surprising collateral phenotype of cells with mutant alleles of RTG1 or RTG2 is that they are unable to utilize acetate as a sole carbon source. That phenotype is usually associated with some block in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is not observed in cells which lack only CS2 activity(6Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Google Scholar, 11Rosenkrantz M. Alam T. Kim K.-S. Clark B.J. Srere P.A. Guarente L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4509-4515Google Scholar). These observations raised the question of whether cells with mutant alleles of RTG1 and RTG2 could utilize the two carbon acetyl-CoA units generated by β-oxidation of fatty acids. To test this, we determined whether ρ+ COP161U7 cells with null alleles of RTG1 (Δrtg1) or RTG2 (Δrtg2) or both (Δrtg1Δrtg2) could grow on medium containing oleic acid as the sole carbon source. Both wild-type ρ+ and the null mutant derivatives were serially diluted on YP medium containing 0.2% oleic acid and 0.25% Tween 40. As a control, the same dilutions were plated on YPD medium. Fig. 3 shows that while all strains grow comparably well on YPD, all of the rtg mutant strains show impaired growth on oleic acid medium compared with the wild-type strain, COP161U7. A closer inspection of the plates suggests that oleate growth for the Δrtg2 and Δrtg1Δrtg2 double mutant is slightly more impaired than the Δrtg1 mutant strain. The reduced ability of the rtg mutant cells to efficiently utilize oleic acid in the growth medium could be due to an impairment in the induction of peroxisomal enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway. To investigate this possibility, we have carried out quantitative Northern blot analysis to measure the effects of null alleles of RTG1 and RTG2, both singly and in combination, on the mRNA levels for three peroxisomal proteins known to be highly induced in cells grown on oleic acid(18Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Google Scholar, 19Skoneczny S. Chelstowska A. Rytka J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 297-302Google Scholar). These are acetyl-CoA oxidase and catalase A (encoded by the POX1 and CTA1 genes, respectively), and a major peroxisomal membrane protein, Pmp27 (encoded by the PMP27 gene), whose abundance in cells closely follows peroxisomal proliferation and is required for peroxisome division and segregation(20Marshall P.A. Krimkevich Y.I. Lark R.H. Dyer J.M. Veenhuis M. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 345-355Google Scholar, 21Erdman R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 509-523Google Scholar). Respiratory-competent wild-type ρ+ cells from strain COP161U7 and the Δrtg1, Δrtg2, and Δrtg1Δrtg2 mutant derivatives were grown on YPR medium in the presence or absence of 0.2% oleic acid. Under these conditions, all of the strains will grow, and the presence of oleic acid in the medium should induce enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway. The levels of acetyl-CoA oxidase, catalase A, and Pmp27p mRNAs were then determined by Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from these cells using specific hybridization probes for each (see “Experimental Procedures”). A summary of the quantification of these Northern blots for a representative experiment is presented in Fig. 4. First, as expected, growth of wild-type cells in the presence of oleic acid results in a large increase in the abundance of the mRNAs for all three of these peroxisomal proteins. Second, relative to wild-type cells, the mRNA levels are reduced to 60-70% in the Δrtg1 mutant and 20-40% in the Δrtg2 mutant. The effects of these mutations are roughly additive, since in the Δrtg1Δrtg2 double disruption strain, oleate induction is further reduced to only 10-15% of the mRNA levels observed in the wild-type strain. These data are consistent with the impaired growth of the rtg mutant strains on medium containing oleic acid (Fig. 3). Taken together, these findings indicate that the RTG genes, while required specifically for CIT2 expression, are also important for oleic acid induction of other peroxisomal proteins. The same RNA samples from the strains used in the previous experiment were analyzed by Northern blotting to determine whether oleic acid also induces expression of the glyoxylate cycle genes, CIT2, MDH3, MLS1, and ICL1. As shown in Fig. 5, the mRNA abundance of all four of these genes was greatly increased in wild-type cells when grown in medium containing oleic acid. These data are consistent with the experiments of McCammon et al.(13McCammon M.T. Veenhuis M. Trapp S.B. Goodman J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5816-5827Google Scholar), which indicated from cytochemical and cell fractionation studies of oleate grown yeast cells, that the enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle are peroxisomal. As we have shown previously, both RTG1 and RTG2 are required for basal level and retrograde-induced expression of CIT2 in cells grown on rich raffinose medium(6Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Google Scholar). The requirement of RTG1 for CIT2 expression is also evident in the oleate induction experiment of Fig. 5, where we could not detect any CIT2 mRNA in oleate-grown Δrtg1 cells or the Δrtg1Δrtg2 strain, despite the fact that in wild-type cells, CIT2 mRNA abundance is increased ~30-fold when those cells are grown in the presence of oleic acid. The mRNA levels for MDH3, MLS1, and ICL1 in the oleate-grown Δrtg1 mutant was decreased to 20-35% of the wild-type level. Surprisingly, in Δrtg2 cells grown in the presence of oleic acid, CIT2 mRNA was not only detectable but its abundance was about 40% of the wild-type level. Hence, the RTG2 requirement for basal CIT2 expression in cells grown on rich raffinose medium (6Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Google Scholar) is evidently bypassed when cells are grown on medium containing oleic acid. MDH3 expression in Δrtg cells was reduced by only 25% of wild-type, and, for MLS1 and ICL2, the mutation resulted in an increase (2- and 2.5-fold, respectively) in the abundance of the mRNAs for these genes, suggesting that RTG2 can also act as a repressor. The ability of oleic acid to increase expression of MDH3, MLS1, and ICL1 is essentially blocked in the Δrtg1Δrtg2 double mutant, indicating that under this growth condition RTG1 is epistatic to RTG2 for expression of these genes. The present work extends our analysis of the retrograde regulation of nuclear gene expression in response to the functional state of mitochondria in S. cerevisiae. One of the goals of the current study was to determine the specificity of the retrograde response; that is, whether other lesions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle besides the absence of CS1 activity would also elicit an increase in CIT2 expression and whether other genes encoding glyoxylate cycle enzymes might be subject to retrograde control. Regarding the former, we have shown that ρ+ cells containing a null allele of the tricarboxylic acid cycle gene MDH1 also have an elevated level of CIT2 mRNA comparable to that observed in ρ+Δcit1 cells. This finding suggests that CIT2 expression is not likely to be dependent specifically on mitochondrial CS1 activity. How CIT2 expression senses the functional status of the tricarboxylic acid cycle is not clear. In ρ+ cells with a null allele of either CIT1 or MDH1, the increase in CIT2 mRNA abundance relative to wild-type ρ+ cells is not as great as is observed in ρ0 petites. Together with our previous finding that CIT2 expression also increases (about 2-fold) by simply growing wild-type ρ+ cells on a fermentable carbon source in the presence of a respiratory chain inhibitor(5Liao X. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Google Scholar), we conclude that CIT2 retrograde control is likely to be a complex phenomenon involving the cumulative effects of different mitochondrial lesions. Like many other organisms with a glyoxylate cycle, yeast is able to utilize acetate as a sole carbon source, relying on the glyoxylate cycle to provide two 2-carbon units for net gluconeogenesis(33Tolbert N.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 133-157Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA generated from β-oxidation of fatty acids can be a source of these 2-carbon units, which can shuttle from peroxisomes into mitochondria through the organelle-specific acylcarnitine transferases (34Atomi H. Ueda M. Suzuki J. Kamada Y. Tanaka A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 112: 31-34Google Scholar). We suggested previously that the retrograde response of CIT2 expression is a means of increasing the flux of carbon, and particularly citrate, from the glyoxylate cycle to mitochondria, perhaps in response to conditions where tricarboxylic acid cycle activity is limiting(5Liao X. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Google Scholar, 10Shyjan A.W. Butow R.A. Current Biol. 1993; 3: 398-400Google Scholar). The findings that cells with mutant alleles of either RTG1 or RTG2 cannot grow on acetate and are auxotrophic for glutamate/aspartate, which are phenotypes characteristic of cells with blocks in both the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles(11Rosenkrantz M. Alam T. Kim K.-S. Clark B.J. Srere P.A. Guarente L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4509-4515Google Scholar), is consistent with the function of the RTG genes in effecting communication between these pathways. A comparison of mRNA abundance in ρ+ and in ρ0 cells of the three other glyoxylate cycle genes examined, MLS1, ICL1, and MDH3, shows that at this level of analysis, the retrograde response of glyoxylate cycle genes is specific for CIT2. Together with our previous finding that increased CIT2 expression compensates for a reduction in tricarboxylic acid cycle activity(5Liao X. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Google Scholar), this observation suggests that CS2 activity could be a limiting step in the glyoxylate cycle. We are cautious, however, in noting that it is not straightforward to pinpoint a rate-limiting step in the in vivo operation of a metabolic pathway(35Srere P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 519-520Google Scholar), particularly if the pathway has branch points(36Kashiwaya Y. Sato K. Tsuchiya N. Thomas S. Fell D.A. Veech R.L. Passonneau J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25502-25514Google Scholar). Thus, while the possibility is attractive that CS2 activity is an important control point in the metabolic interaction between the glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycles, that notion will require further study. Although Δrtg1 and Δrtg2 strains are unable to use acetate directly as a sole carbon source, it remained possible that they could utilize acetyl-CoA generated by β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids in the growth medium. We found, however, that the mutants were also compromised in their ability to utilize oleic acid as a carbon source. The latter defect could be due to an inability of the mutant cells to efficiently utilize acetyl-CoA generated by β-oxidation of oleic acid or to some other defect in the pathway of oleic acid metabolism. In an attempt to clarify this issue, we examined the oleic acid induction of mRNAs for three peroxisomal proteins: two of them, POX1 and CTA1 (encoding acetyl-CoA oxidase and catalase A, respectively), are involved in β-oxidation; the third, PMP27, encodes the most abundant protein associated with peroxisomal membranes in yeast and is required for oleic acid induction of wild-type peroxisomal profiles(20Marshall P.A. Krimkevich Y.I. Lark R.H. Dyer J.M. Veenhuis M. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 345-355Google Scholar, 21Erdman R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 509-523Google Scholar). PMP27 expression is thus a convenient marker for peroxisome proliferation. The results of these experiments show that both RTG1 and RTG2 are required roughly additively for full oleic acid induction of expression of these peroxisomal protein genes (abbreviated as P-C-P): in the Δrtg1Δrtg2 double mutant, oleic acid induction is inhibited by 85-90%. Moreover, each of the P-C-P genes is affected similarly in the single rtg mutant strains where the apparent requirement for RTG2 is greater than RTG1. Taken together, these data point to a similarity of function between the RTG genes and PAS (peroxisome assembly) genes that are required for peroxisome biogenesis(37Simon M. Binder M. Adam G. Hartig A. Ruis H. Yeast. 1992; 8: 303-309Google Scholar, 38Elgersma Y. Vandenberg M. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Genetics. 1993; 135: 731-740Google Scholar, 39Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H.

The oleic acid-induced expression of a number of genes encoding peroxisomal proteins in yeast has been shown to require a 5’-flanking cis-acting sequence called an ORE (oleate response element) that is a target site for trans-acting transcription factors(41Einerhand A.W.C. Kos W.T. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 323-331Google Scholar, 42Filipitz M. Simon M.M. Rapatz W. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 49-55Google Scholar). Although the RTG2 product does not resemble a DNA-binding protein or known transcription factors, the RTG1 product has been shown to be a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that binds to the UASr upstream of CIT2 and is essential for its expression(6Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Google Scholar). One possibility, therefore, is that RTG1 is also a specific component of ORE complexes. However, the RTG1 product does not appear to bind to the ORE upstream of the FOX3 gene(41Einerhand A.W.C. Kos W.T. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 323-331Google Scholar), which encodes the oleic acid-inducible peroxisomal enzyme 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase and whose induction by oleic acid also requires RTG1.3 3H. Tabak, personal communication. We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that the RTG1 product interacts with other OREs. In any case, the similarity of inhibition of oleic acid induction of the P-C-P gene in the Δrtg1, Δrtg2, and Δrtg1Δrtg2 double mutant strains suggests that the RTG genes may be required at some relatively early step in the oleic acid induction of peroxisome proliferation. Lewin et al.(12Lewin A.S. Hines V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1399-1405Google Scholar) and McCammon et al.(13McCammon M.T. Veenhuis M. Trapp S.B. Goodman J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5816-5827Google Scholar) localized glyoxylate cycle enzymes in peroxisomes of yeast cells grown on medium containing oleic acid. The present study represents, to our knowledge, the first quantitative analysis of the effects of oleic acid on expression of genes encoding glyoxylate cycle enzymes in yeast. While the oleic acid-induced levels of expression are comparable to the induction of expression of the P-C-P genes studied here, the results with the rtg mutants are somewhat different. First, despite the large induction of CIT2 mRNA in wild-type ρ+ cells grown on medium containing oleic acid, no CIT2 mRNA was detected in the Δrtg1 or Δrtg1Δrtg2 mutant strains. Similar results were obtained with ρ0Δrtg1 cells grown on medium containing oleic acid (data not shown), underscoring the absolute requirement of RTG1 for CIT2 expression(6Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Google Scholar). Second, unlike the P-C-P genes, oleic acid induction of the glyoxylate cycle genes shows a greater requirement for RTG1 than for RTG2. In fact, the absence of the RTG2 product results in an ~2-fold elevation in the mRNA abundance for MLS1 and ICL1 in cells grown on oleic acid medium. These data show that the RTG2 product can act as both a positive and negative regulator of oleate-induced peroxisomal gene expression. Finally, despite the complexities of the various responses, it is apparent that the RTG genes play a key role in a threeway communication between mitochondria, the nucleus, and peroxisomes.

To distinguish between the mechanisms by which the cytidine to uridine transition could occur a combined transcription/RNA editing assay and an in vitro RNA editing system were investigated. Mitochondria isolated from etiolated pea seedlings and potato tubers were supplied with [α-32P]CTP to radiolabel the mitochondrial run-on transcripts. High molecular weight run-on transcripts were isolated and hydrolyzed, and nucleotide identities were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. The amount of label comigrating with UMP nucleotides increases with extended incubation times. Analogous products were obtained by incubation of [α-32P]CTP or [5-3H]CTP radiolabeled in vitro transcripts with a mitochondrial lysate from pea mitochondria. 5-3H label of the cytosine base was detected in the UMP spot after incubation of in vitro transcripts with mitochondrial lysate. These results are consistent with a deamination reaction involved in this post-transcriptional C to U modification process. To prove that cytidines are deaminated specifically in vitro transcripts were reisolated after incubation and analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

Sequence analysis clearly shows that only cytidines at editing sites are edited while residual cytidines are not modified and suggests that site-specific factors are involved in RNA editing of plant mitochondria. RNA editing in higher plant mitochondria is a process by which genomically encoded cytidine residues are changed to uridines on the RNA level(1Covello P.S. Gray M.W. Nature. 1989; 341: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 2Gualberto J.M. Lamattina L. Bonnard G. Weil J.-H. Grienenberger J.-M.

Although most of the conversions have been found in translated regions, structural RNAs, intron sequences, and also leader and trailer sequences are occasionally modified(4Schuster W. Ternes R. Knoop V. Hiesel R. Wissinger B. Brennicke A. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Polypeptides translated from edited transcripts show a higher similarity to their homologues in animals or fungi than those predicted from unedited transcripts(5Covello P.S. Gray M.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Schuster W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two biochemically distinct processes have been identified as capable of changing the information at the RNA level. One involves the insertion or deletion of nucleotides(7Benne R. van den Burg J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Sloof P. van Boom J.H. Tromp M.C. Cell. 1986; 46: 819-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and the other modifies specific nucleotides in the mRNA sequence(8Chen S.-H. Habib G. Yang C.Y. Gu Z.W. Lee B.R. Weng S.A. Silberman S.R. Cai S.J. Deslypere J.P. Rosseneu M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Li W.H. Chan L. Science. 1987; 238: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). RNA editing in kinetoplastid protozoa exemplifies the process of an insertional editing system with the addition and deletion of uridine residues at specific sites. In the current model this editing machinery is guided by small RNAs (guide RNAs) that are complementary to the edited transcripts (9Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) and also serve as a uridine donor for the editing activity(10Blum B. Sturm N. Simpson A.M. Simpson L. Cell. 1991; 65: 543-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Modifications of nucleotides in tRNA or ribosomal RNA sequences, although usually not called RNA editing, can affect the stability of the RNA or modulate the RNA's conformation and identity. In the alternative process RNA editing changes the information content via modification, e.g. in creating a UAA stop-translation codon from a CAA glutamine codon in apolipoprotein B mRNA or by modification of a CAG codon specifying glutamine to an arginine codon (CGG) in neural glutamate-gated calcium channel mRNA(11Sommer B. Khler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). In the latter example, a double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase has been suggested as the enzyme responsible for deaminating adenosine to inosine and thus changing a CAG codon to CIG(12Higuchi M. Single F.N. Khler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In apolipoprotein B mRNA editing, a cytidine deaminase has been shown to be one component of the enzymatic modification activity(13Navaratnam N. Morrison J.R. Bhattacharya S. Patel D. Funabashi T. Giannoni F. Teng B.-B. Davidson N.O. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20709-20712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither biochemical mechanism of the editing reaction in higher plant mitochondria nor the components of the editing machinery are currently known. Three possible mechanisms able to change a cytidine post-transcriptionally could proceed by modification of the base, by base exchange, or by replacement of the complete nucleotide (Fig. 1). The most simple would be creation of a uridine by a site-specific hydrolytic deamination of the cytosine at position 4. Modification of the base pairing ability of the cytidine, e.g. by the attachment of the amino acid lysine at position 2 of the cytidine, would create a lysidine that is read by most enzymes as a uridine. Another possibility is a transglycosylation reaction in which the cytosine is replaced by uracil through breaking and reforming of the glycosyl bond. Alternatively the cytidine nucleotide could be replaced by a uridine nucleotide through cleavage and ligation of the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA chain. To investigate the biochemical nature underlying the RNA editing process in mitochondria of higher plants, we traced the fate of the α-phosphate of the cytidine and a 5-3H label in the cytosine base after incorporation into high molecular weight RNA. A system for coupled transcription/RNA editing was established for this purpose. Results obtained by this system are confirmed by an in vitro RNA editing analysis, in which 32P or 3H radiolabeled in vitro transcripts were incubated with lysates from pea mitochondria. To show that the editing reaction is site-specific we compared edited and unedited templates after incubation with mitochondrial lysate. Mitochondria were isolated from potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum var. Bintje) or from dark grown shoots of 4-day-old pea seedlings (Pisum sativum var. Progress) by four 5-s pulses on a high speed blender in extraction buffer containing 400 mM mannitol, 1 mM EGTA, 25 mM Tricine 1The abbreviations used are: TricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinePCRpolymerase chain reactionRTreverse transcription. (pH 7.2), 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and subsequent filtering through two layers of Miracloth. The filtrate was spun at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris and then at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to pellet mitochondria. After several washes in a buffer containing 400 mM mannitol, 10 mM Tricine (pH 7.2), 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, mitochondria were layered onto a 14 to 28 to 45% Percoll step gradient and spun at 70,000 × g for 45 min in a Beckman SW-28 rotor at 4°C. The interface band between 28 and 45% was collected and washed several times. Mitochondria were used on the day of isolation for the in organello run-on transcription/RNA editing analysis. N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription. The RNA editing extract of pea mitochondria was prepared according to a modification of the method used to isolate wheat mitochondrial editing activity(14Araya A. Domec C. Begu D. Litvak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were lysed in the presence of 1 M ammonium sulfate and 0.2% Triton X-100. Centrifugation of the lysate at 100,000 × g yielded a membrane-free soluble protein fraction (S100). The S100 fraction was subjected to anion-exchange chromatography using DEAE-cellulose, and proteins were eluted with 50 mM KCl. The fractions were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10% (w/v) glycerol, concentrated using a Centricon-3 microconcentrator (Amicon), and stored at −80°C. Highly purified mitochondria (200 μg) were resuspended in 1 ml of run-on buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 200 units of RNasin, 0.5 mM each of UTP, ATP, and GTP, and 250 μCi of [α-32P]CTP(15Finnegan P.M. Brown G.G. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 304-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C, and aliquots were taken after different times up to 1 h. In some experiments, radiolabeled UTP was used instead of CTP to follow the run-on transcription. To investigate the possibility of cytidine to uridine conversion at the nucleotide level high concentrations of cold UTP (5 mM) were used in some run-on transcription assays. After 10, 30, and 60 min of incubation, aliquots were taken and nucleic acids were isolated from mitochondria by two phenol/chloroform extractions. The high molecular weight nucleic acid fraction was purified by a NAP 5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and precipitated with ethanol. Nucleic acids were digested to monophosphate nucleotides with 10 units of nuclease P1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 10 μl of P1 buffer (50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.3)) at 37°C for 2-6 h. To verify that transcripts obtained by in organello transcription are real mitochondrial transcripts, and not bacterial contaminations, blots of digested cosmids with mtDNA of Arabidopsis thaliana were hybridized with the transcriptional products of the in organello synthesis (data not shown). Aliquots (5-10 μl) of the nuclease P1 hydrolyzed products were spotted onto cellulose TLC plates (CEL 300-10, Macherey-Nagel, Germany), and one- and two-dimensional chromatography was carried out at 20°C. The solvent systems used for two-dimensional TLC were isobutyric acid/water/25% ammonia (66:33:1 by volume) for the first dimension and 2-propanol/37% HCl/water (70:15:15 by volume) for the second dimension(16Nishimura S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1972; 12: 49-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). One-dimensional TLC was developed in t-butanol/37% HCl/water (70:15:15 by volume). To identify the positions of the 5ʹ-monophosphates by UV shadowing 2-5 μl each of 100 mM solutions of cytidine, adenosine, uridine, and guanosine 5ʹ-monophosphates (NMPs) were added. The relative positions of the nucleotides varied slightly depending on the time of development and the condition of the solvents, e.g. after repeated use. Spots containing hydrolyzed 3H-labeled CMP and UMP were identified after TLC separation by UV shadowing and removed from the TLC plate. After elution of the NMPs from the cellulose material 2 ml of liquid scintillation mixture (Ready Safe, Beckman) were added, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The templates for in vitro transcription were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers: T7-5ʹ-primer (cox2): 5ʹ-AGGATC CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATCTTCCTCATTCTTATTTTGG-3ʹ; 3ʹ-primer (cox2): 5ʹ-AGGATCCAGGTACAGCATCACATTTGAC-3ʹ; T7-5ʹ-primer (orf206): 5ʹ-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACTTCACCTACTTCA-3ʹ; 3ʹ-primer (orf206): 5ʹ-AAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAAAAAGAGATACGAAC-3ʹ. The PCR products obtained represent either an internal part of the cox2 gene (542 nucleotides) from pea(17Covello P.S. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5189-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which is linked upstream with a promoter sequence of the T7 RNA polymerase or a highly edited region (114 nucleotides) of the orf206 gene(6Schuster W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the PCR reaction mtDNA or random primed cDNA from pea mitochondria was used. RT-PCR of orf206 in vitro transcripts was initiated by first strand cDNA synthesis primed by a T3-primer (5ʹ-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3ʹ). The PCR reaction was done using the T7-orf206- and the T3-primers, and the PCR amplification products were cloned into the pCR™II vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.5 μg of each primer, 50 fmol of each dNTP, 10 ng of cDNA, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). PCR was performed on a Biomed cycler under the following conditions: cycle 1, 1 min at 94°C; cycle 2, 1 min at 45°C; and cycle 3, 3 min at 72°C. All cycles were repeated 30 times, and an extension of 10 min at 72°C was added at the end. In the in vitro transcription reactions 2 μg of PCR product were used. Labeled transcripts were prepared under standard conditions using [α-32P]CTP, [α-32P]UTP, or [5ʹ-3H]CTP and T7 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). To obtain RNA of maximal specific activity, 500 μCi of [5ʹ-3H]CTP at 22 Ci/mmol was dried and used per transcription. After transcription, template DNA was removed by DNase I, and the synthesized RNA was precipitated. Aliquots of each reaction step were analyzed on agarose gels to monitor the reactions and to verify the transcription products. The labeled in vitro RNAs were either incubated with mitochondrial lysates or used directly as a control after nuclease P1 digestion in the TLC to analyze the separation conditions. A typical in vitro RNA editing assay contained 50 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 10 mM magnesium acetate, and 25 units of RNasin in a final volume of 50 μl. 40 μg of mitochondrial protein was used per assay. To study the biochemistry of the RNA editing process in higher plants, isolated mitochondria were initially chosen as the most intact system. Attempts to transfer in vitro transcripts as editing templates into isolated mitochondria by electroporation had failed to give clear results. 2W. Yu and W. Schuster, unpublished data. A run-on transcription system (15Finnegan P.M. Brown G.G. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 304-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mulligan R.M. Leon P. Walbot V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was therefore chosen to approach in vitro the RNA editing process in plant mitochondria. This system allows direct in organello labeling of the editing substrate (mitochondrial RNA) coupled with the possibility to follow the RNA editing process in a time-dependent manner. To analyze RNA editing in intact mitochondria, purified potato mitochondria were supplied with [α-32P]CTP to label the newly transcribed mitochondrial transcripts. Aliquots were taken after 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min of incubation, and nucleic acids were extracted. Nucleic acids were treated with DNase I, and the bulk of the unincorporated label was removed by gel filtration chromatography on NAP 5 columns (Pharmacia). After digestion of the labeled high molecular weight RNA with nuclease P1 the resulting 5ʹ-monophosphate nucleotides were separated by one- and two-dimensional TLC (Fig. 2). After 15 min of incubation new discrete spots begin to appear and increase in intensity with the time of incubation. One of the spots comigrates with UMP in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional TLC. Two additional spots (x and y) that are not specific to RNA editing generally appear in relatively constant proportion and are most likely incompletely digested dinucleotides, since they also appear after nuclease P1 digestion of in vitro synthesized transcripts not incubated with mitochondrial lysates. Similar results have been previously reported by other investigators for the human apolipoprotein B and maize mitochondrial editing systems(18Hodges P.E. Navaratnam N. Greeve J.C. Scott J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1197-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Rajasekhar V.R. Mulligan R.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1843-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether these results are restricted to potato mitochondria we tested mitochondria of several other plant species. Pea mitochondria showed the highest in organello transcriptional activity of the species investigated (data not shown) and were therefore used for further studies. A lysed in organello system was used to study run-on transcription (19Mulligan R.M. Leon P. Walbot V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and RNA editing in disrupted mitochondria. Purified pea mitochondria were supplied with [α-32P]CTP, analogous to intact mitochondria, without added osmoticum. After 30 and 60 min aliquots were taken, nucleic acids were extracted, and the purified high molecular weight RNAs were analyzed by TLC after nuclease P1 digestion (Fig. 3). After incubation for 30 min an additional spot appeared comigrating with UMP in the TLC mononucleotide analysis. To exclude that the radiolabeled UMP detected by the TLC analysis is due to a CTP deaminase activity produced at the mononucleotide level rather than modification at the polynucleotide level, we added a 10-fold excess of unlabeled UTP to compete any such reaction. The radiolabeled nucleotide comigrating with UMP retained about the same intensity in both high or low UTP (Fig. 3). These results show that labeled UMP was not integrated into the nascent RNA chain as [α-32P]UTP. Furthermore, this observation indicates that there is no detectable level of CTP deaminase activity in plant mitochondria. RNA editing activity was thus detected in both intact and lysed mitochondria by a coupled transcription/RNA editing system. To investigate the editing activity in mitochondrial lysates we incubated [α-32P]CTP-labeled in vitro transcripts of the cox2 and orf206 genes with lysates from pea mitochondria. The cox2 template (Fig. 4) selected for in vitro transcription contains 11 in vivo editing sites (17Covello P.S. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5189-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and was amplified by PCR from mtDNA of pea. The labeled in vitro synthesized cox2 transcripts were incubated with S100 supernatant and extracts obtained after DEAE anion-exchange chromatography. After incubation the in vitro transcripts were reisolated, and the monophosphate nucleotide composition was analyzed by TLC (Fig. 4). A small amount of radiolabeled UMP (pU) was visible in the S100 incubation while no pU could be detected in a heat-treated S100 fraction. Heat inactivation thus appears to completely abolish the editing activity. A strong pU signal was observed after incubation of the cox2 transcript with the DEAE fraction. To follow the fate of the cytosine base in order to distinguish between transglycosylation and deamination we used [5ʹ-3H]CTP to label in vitro transcripts. After incubation with pea mitochondrial lysates we determined the amount of radioactivity appearing in the UMP spot after TLC separation (Fig. 5). No label is expected in the UMP spot if the CMP to UMP conversion occurs by a transglycosylation reaction, while [5ʹ-3H]UMP is the expected product of a deamination process. Although [5ʹ-3H]CTP is available at a much lower specific activity than [α-32P]CTP and detection is more difficult, we did observe a significant increase of radioactivity in the UMP spot after incubation of 3H-labeled transcripts with mitochondrial lysates for 60 min at 30°C (Fig. 5). The radioactivity of the CMP spot was determined in independent experiments with 2,360 and 3,800 cpm, respectively. The UMP spot of the incubated transcript was labeled with 140 and 170 cpm. Only background radioactivity (20 ± 5 cpm) could be measured in UMP spots not incubated with mitochondrial lysate. About 10% of the cytidines represent editing sites in the cox2 in vitro transcript, and accordingly only between 236 and 380 cpm are expected for a fully edited transcript. From these data we conclude that only about 30-40% of the editing sites have been changed from C to U in this system. To investigate whether the in vitro RNA editing system works at specific cytidines we compared edited with unedited templates of orf206 after incubation with pea mitochondrial lysates. The orf206 gene was selected because it is one of the most highly edited genes detected to date in plant mitochondria(6Schuster W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The unedited in vitro transcript covers 11 editing sites that are replaced by uridines in the edited RNA (Fig. 6). After incubation with mitochondrial pea lysates for 30 min the incubated in vitro transcripts were hydrolyzed and the resulting NMPs were separated by TLC. Radiolabeled UMP was detected only from unedited templates indicating that only specific editing sites have been modified. Incubation of the edited template revealed no label comigrating with UMP although 25 32P-labeled cytidines are still present in the polynucleotide chain. After incubation of T7-transcribed in vitro transcripts of unedited orf206 first strand cDNA was synthesized from a T3 primer. The PCR product obtained with the T7-orf206- and T3-primers was cloned, and 20 cDNA clones were sequenced (Fig. 7). No PCR product was obtained with either the lysate alone or with pea mtDNA. None of the cDNA clones was fully edited; however, 6 out of 20 clones analyzed showed C to U transitions indicating RNA editing at some of the expected cytidine positions. One clone showed 7 out of the 8 expected C to U changes of the fully edited orf206 transcript. Two clones showed 3 changes, one clone was edited at two sites, and two clones were modified at only a single site. In the 20 cDNA clones sequenced no other modification was observed. The editing pattern of the in vitro edited transcripts indicates that RNA editing occurs at individual sites independently. From this observation it is tempting to speculate that site-specific factors may be involved for individual sites. To analyze the biochemical nature of the RNA editing reaction in plant mitochondria we followed the fate of the α-phosphate of cytidine nucleotides and the labeled cytosine base to distinguish between the possible reaction mechanisms. The experiments show that intact and lysed mitochondrial systems are useful tools to study organellar run-on transcription (15Finnegan P.M. Brown G.G. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 304-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rajasekhar V.R. Mulligan R.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1843-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and RNA editing in plants (19Mulligan R.M. Leon P. Walbot V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The results obtained by in organello and in vitro systems show that in the RNA editing process the production of uridine from cytidine occurs at the polynucleotide level. In coupled run-on transcription/RNA editing systems of higher plants the product of the RNA editing process in mitochondria was determined as a genuine uridine. Furthermore, incubation of in vitro transcripts with mitochondrial lysates showed that the editing process is not directly linked to transcription in mitochondria. During the process of RNA editing the 5ʹ-phosphate of the modified cytidine is maintained, which is consistent with either a deamination/transamination or a transglycosylation process. The replacement of cytidine in the polynucleotide chain by uridine by a deletion and insertion process can now be excluded, because no enzymatic insertion mechanism is known that can introduce a nucleotide into a polynucleotide chain without insertion of the 5ʹ-phosphate of the donor. In a transglycosylation reaction the phosphoribosyl chain is maintained, but the base is exchanged. This mechanism is used to post-transcriptionally modify preformed tRNAs, e.g. by the introduction of hypoxanthine (21Elliott M.S. Trewyn R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2407-2410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and queosine(22Okada N. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3061-3066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A straightforward hydrolytic deamination appears to be most likely the reaction in plant mitochondrial C to U RNA editing because following a 3H-labeled cytosine base led to labeled UMP. The occasional reverse editings from uridine to cytidine(23Schuster W. Hiesel R. Wissinger B. Brennicke A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2428-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), however, cannot as easily be explained by a straightforward reverse deamination process. Either the reverse U to C editing is catalyzed by a different mechanism, e.g. by a CTP synthase, or the deamination process involves the transfer of the released amine to another molecule in a transamination reaction. A site-specific deaminase catalyzes the conversion from C to U in the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing(13Navaratnam N. Morrison J.R. Bhattacharya S. Patel D. Funabashi T. Giannoni F. Teng B.-B. Davidson N.O. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20709-20712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of this type of RNA editing shares high homology to cytidine deaminases, while the target site in the mRNA is determined by a second additional factor that is proposed to bind downstream of the editing site at a conserved sequence motif. A completely unrelated deamination activity, selective for double-stranded RNAs, converts adenosyl residues to inosines in a process termed double strand RNA unwinding(24Bass B.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1988; 55: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). This enzymatic activity seems to be also involved in the editing process of the mammalian neuronal glutamate-gated ion channel mRNA, where a CIG codon is created from CAG(12Higuchi M. Single F.N. Khler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In wheat mitochondria an in vitro RNA editing system has been reported (14Araya A. Domec C. Begu D. Litvak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that edits atp9 transcripts and requires no exogenous nucleotides. This observation supports a deamination reaction for RNA editing in plant mitochondria, although it has to be taken into account that in this lysate endogenous nucleotides have not been depleted. Another recent report, also based on a similar experimental approach, likewise suggests the conversion of cytidine to uridine in intact mitochondria of maize and Petunia by either a deamination or transglycosylation mechanism(20Rajasekhar V.R. Mulligan R.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1843-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish between deamination and transglycosylation we followed the fate of a 3H-labeled cytosine base, which led to 3H-labeled UMP. These results are consistent with a deamination reaction because in a transglycosylation reaction unlabeled UMP is expected as product. To determine the specificity of the in vitro reaction edited and unedited templates were tested in the mitochondrial lysate and analyzed by RT-PCR after incubation. The data show that the in vitro RNA editing system of pea mitochondria described here is specific for cytidines at editing positions while other cytidines in the polynucleotide chain are no targets for C to U RNA editing. How site selection is determined is still enigmatic, while the RNA editing patterns observed in in vitro incubated templates clearly indicate the involvement of site-specific factor(s) for individual editing sites.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12682-12690Google Scholar). These enzymes are thought to be responsible at least in part for the assembly of a cornified cell envelope, which provides a vitally important barrier function for the tissue(18Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Google Scholar, 19Reichert U. Michel S. Schmidt R. Darmon M. Blumenberg M. Molecular Biology of the Skin: The Keratinocyte. Academic Press Inc., New York1993: 107-150Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of assembly of this structure and the substrate preferences, if any, of these three TGases in cornified cell envelope formation remains to be resolved. Such studies are complicated by the fact that the TGase 1 enzyme is perhaps the most difficult to work with because of its lability during isolation and purification(2Thacher S.M. Rice R.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 685-695Google Scholar, 20Thacher S.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 578-584Google Scholar, 21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar). However, we have recently demonstrated that a recombinant TGase 1 enzyme can be expressed in bacteria, which has an activity comparable with that isolated from cultured keratinocytes(21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar). Furthermore, by deletion cloning, removal of the first 36-98 residues results in large increases in specific activity as well as changes in reactivities toward and kinetic efficiencies with a number of potential cornified cell envelope substrates, but removal of up to 240 residues from the carboxyl-terminal end has little affect on activity(21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar). Thus an important question arises as to whether smaller highly active forms of the TGase 1 system exist in cells. transglutaminase(s) normal human epidermal keratinocytes polyvinylidene difluoride Tris-buffered saline suggested new nomenclature for the membrane-associated enzyme (K) suggested new nomenclature for the tissue enzyme (C) suggested new nomenclature for pro-enzyme (E) fast protein liquid chromatography N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. In addition, a truncated recombinant form of 467 amino acid residues, which retained half of the activity of the full-length TGase 1 expressed form or native enzyme from cultured cells(21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar), has been used to make a TGase 1 polyclonal antibody. This antibody decorates the entire epidermis, including the basal layers and epidermal derivative organs such as the hair follicle(22Kim S.-Y. Yoneda K. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 103: 211-217Google Scholar, 23Steinert P.M. Lee S.-C. Kim S.-Y. Yoneda K. Chonnam J. Med. Sci. 1994; 6: 78-87Google Scholar). In contrast, a widely used commercially available TGase 1 monoclonal antibody (B.C1) decorates only the granular layer of the epidermis(20Thacher S.M. J. Invest.

By Western blotting methods, the monoclonal antibody recognizes a band of about 90 kDa(20Thacher S.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 578-584Google Scholar, 26Duvic M. Nelson D.C. Annarella M. Cho M.

Yoneda K. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 103: 211-217Google Scholar). However, our new antibody recognizes a major band of 106 kDa, which is apparently the true full-length size of the TGase 1 enzyme in keratinocytes(21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar, 22Kim S.-Y. Yoneda K. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 103: 211-217Google Scholar). This 15% increase in size may be due to postsynthetic modifications of a basic core protein of 92 kDa(7Kim H.-C. Idler W.W. Kim I.-G. Han J.-H. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 536-539Google Scholar, 8Kim I.-G. McBride O.W. Wang M. Kim S.-Y. Idler W.W. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7710-7717Google Scholar, 27Chakravarty R. Rice R.H. J. Biol.

Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar, 22Kim S.-Y. Yoneda K. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Invest.

Cell. 1985; 40: 685-695Google Scholar), that may be due to degradation of the TGase 1 protein or cross-reactivity with other TGase proteins of the keratinocytes. In the process of a systematic analysis of these possibilities by use of immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments, we have found to our surprise that the TGase 1 system in cultured epidermal keratinocytes and foreskin epidermal cells is far more complicated than heretofore described. It has been thought that most of the “soluble” (that is, cytosolic) TGase activity in cultured epidermal cells is due to the TGase 2 enzyme(2Thacher S.M. Rice R.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 685-695Google Scholar, 16Kim H.-C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.-C. Girard J.E. Folk J.E. Chung S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Google Scholar, 18Greenberg C.S.

Chem. 1970; 246: 1093-1098Google Scholar), whereas most of the TGase 1 activity is anchored to membranes(2Thacher S.M. Rice R.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 685-695Google Scholar, 18Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Google Scholar, 19Reichert U. Michel S. Schmidt R. Darmon M. Blumenberg M. Molecular Biology of the Skin: The Keratinocyte. Academic Press Inc., New York1993: 107-150Google Scholar). We describe here that most of the soluble TGase activity in cultured keratinocytes is in fact due to soluble full-length or smaller more active forms of the TGase 1 enzyme, generated by proteolytic processing of the full-length protein at specific sequence sites comparable with the sites of activation of other TGases. Normal human foreskin epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA) were seeded at a density of 5.103 cells/cm2 in 15-cm dishes and grown in low Ca2+ KGM medium (0.05 mM CaCl2) as recommended by the manufacturer. In some cases, at confluence (about 3 days) the medium CaCl2 concentration was raised to 0.6 mM (high Ca2+), previously determined to be optimal for induction of terminal differentiation in human epidermal keratinocytes in cell culture(29Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1218Google Scholar). In other high Ca2+ experiments, the calcium ionophore A23187 (Calbiochem) (30Cline P.R. Rice R.H. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3203-3207Google Scholar) was also added to cultures at confluence (25 μg/ml, final concentration). In most experiments, the cultures were metabolically labeled with a mixture of [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine (1 μCi each/ml of medium) (Amersham Corp.). This was added either (i) 4 h before planned harvesting of cells, or (ii) in pulse-chase experiments, for 4 h in 2 day post-confluent cultures grown in the presence of high Ca2+, followed by replacement with unlabeled medium. As required, the cells were harvested by scraping and sonicated in a buffer containing 0.1 M Tris acetate, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) (TBS) (4 × 108 cells/ml) in the presence (or absence in the case of one control set of experiments) of a mixture of protease inhibitors leupeptin (1 mM), 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mM), calpain inhibitor (10 μM), and aprotinin (0.1 unit/ml) (Boehringer Mannhiem). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to obtain the cytosolic (soluble) fraction. Freshly excised foreskins were cut open and cultured for 4 h in suspension organ culture (5 ml/tissue) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence or presence of 100 μCi each of [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine. Following thorough washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the tissues were floated on trypsin (Difco) overnight at 4°C to separate the epidermis, from which a total epidermal cell suspension was recovered by standard procedures. These cells were then plated on plastic for 4 h exactly as described previously(31Yuspa S.H. Harris C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 86: 95-105Google Scholar), during which time essentially only the basal cells attached(32Jones P.H. Harper S. Watt F.M. Cell. 1995; 80: 83-93Google Scholar). Both the attached and unattached suprabasal cells committed to terminal differentiation were then harvested, sonicated in the TBS buffer, and pelleted to recover the cytosolic fraction as above. Total 35S-labeled foreskin tissues (epidermis + dermis) were used to prepare human actin exactly as described(33Steinert P.M. Peck G.L. Yuspa S.H. McGuire J.S. DiPasquale A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1976; 66: 276Google Scholar). In some experiments, aliquots of the total cell lysates or cytosolic fractions were boiled in polyacrylamide gel loading buffer containing 2% SDS and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were resolved on 10% linear or 10-20% gradient gels. Following transfer to PVDF membranes, bands were identified by Western blotting with specific TGase antibodies and developed with the Bio-Rad reagent(16Kim H.-C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.-C. Girard J.E. Folk J.E. Chung S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Google Scholar). Six recombinant deletion constructs of the human TGase 1 enzyme that produced particularly stable active enzymes were prepared exactly as described previously (21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar) and were constructs 1 (full length, 92 kDa), 2 (ΔN37), 3 (ΔN52), 4 (ΔN61), 5 (ΔN97), and 20 (ΔN108ΔC575). [35S]Cysteine-labeled construct 1 was routinely used as a marker for autoradiography of SDS gels. These recombinant proteins, as well as the native full-length 106-kDa enzyme (prepared from cultured NHEK cells as described below), were substrates for proteolysis using 0.01 unit/ml of dispase (Boehringer Mannhiem) (about 1:20 protease to TGase ratio). The three specific affinity-purified antibodies used were: our new polyclonal anti-human TGase 1 made in goats(22Kim S.-Y. Yoneda K. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 103: 211-217Google Scholar), polyclonal anti-guinea pig liver TGase 2 made in rabbits which cross-reacts with the human enzyme(34Folk J.E. Chung S.-I. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 358-375Google Scholar), and polyclonal anti-guinea pig skin TGase 3 made in rabbits which cross-reacts with the human enzyme (16Kim H.-C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.-C. Girard J.E. Folk J.E. Chung S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Google Scholar). Each of the three antibodies used in this study was serially diluted 10-1 to 10-4 in TBS to explore optimal precipitation of enzyme activity. In control experiments, we found that essentially complete immunoprecipitation of the respective 35S-labeled antigens and activity occurred with a 1:50 dilution of each antibody(21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar, 22Kim S.-Y. Yoneda K. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 103: 211-217Google Scholar). Cell lysate fractions of NHEK cells or separated foreskin epidermal cells (200 μl) were incubated with the antibodies for 1 h at 4°C by gentle shaking. Protein A-conjugated agarose beads (ImmunoPure Plus, Pierce) were pre-equilibrated in TBS buffer, and resuspended as a 1:1 slurry in TBS, of which 20 μl was then added to the cytosolic primary antibody mixtures. Following incubation for 1 h at 4°C in a rotary shaker, the conjugated beads of each reaction were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min and washed twice with TBS to remove unabsorbed proteins. In most experiments, the absorbed antigens and primary antibodies were harvested by boiling the washed beads in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, resolved by electrophoresis on 10% linear or 10-20% gradient polyacrylamide gels, dried, and autoradiographed. Gels were exposed to x-ray film for 1-15 days. In some autoradiograms, selected bands were quantitated by scanning in a computing densitometer with ImageQuant software version 3.0 (Molecular Dynamics). Standard protein markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used. In some experiments, the absorbed active TGase proteins were recovered from the washed beads with 100 μl of elution buffer (Pierce). After 30 s, the suspension was neutralized with 25 μl of 1 M Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.5) and then pelleted to remove the beads. The time of exposure to the low pH (~2.8) elution buffer was strictly limited to ~30 s. Control experiments showed that (i) >95% of the 35S-labeled TGase protein antigens were eluted within 30 s, and (ii) the half-life of TGase 1 activity in the low pH buffer is about 4 min. The TGase 1, 2, and 3 enzymes were recovered from cytosolic fractions of unlabeled or 35S-labeled foreskin epidermal “suprabasal” cells (for the TGase 3 proenzyme) or “basal” cells (for the soluble TGase 1 and TGase 2 enzymes). Samples were chromatographed by FPLC on a 0.5 × 5 cm mono-Q FPLC column equilibrated in a buffer of 50 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA using 60 ml of a 0-0.5 M NaCl linear gradient, and collected into 0.5-ml fractions, essentially as described(16Kim H.-C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.-C. Girard J.E. Folk J.E. Chung S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Google Scholar). Peaks of TGase activities were ascertained by assays of every second fraction. The TGase 3 eluted in the column wash, and the TGase 1 and 2 enzymes eluted at about 0.2 or 0.3 M NaCl, as expected(2Thacher S.M. Rice R.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 685-695Google Scholar, 16Kim H.-C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.-C. Girard J.E. Folk J.E. Chung S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled TGases from immunoprecipitation reactions of cytosolic fractions with either the TGase 1 (22Kim S.-Y. Yoneda K. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 358-375Google Scholar) antibody were resolved similarly and detected by counting every second fraction. In this case, the eluted 35S-labeled TGases were neutralized with 1 M Tris acetate (pH 7.8) and diluted to 1 ml before loading. TGase enzyme forms were also recovered from the cytosolic fraction of 3-day post-confluent NHEK cells that had been grown in high Ca2+ and in the presence of the calcium ionophore. The 35S-labeled cytosolic fraction was immunoprecipitated with antibodies, eluted, neutralized, and the products chromatographed as described above and counted. An alternative method to recover the full-length 106-kDa TGase 1 enzyme was to fractionate the unlabeled cytosolic fraction from 1-day post-confluent NHEK cells grown in low Ca2+. The specificities of the TGase antibodies used was also examined in double immunoprecipitation reactions. In this case, the three 35S-labeled TGases purified from foreskin epidermal cells as described above were used for a second round of immunoprecipitations with various combinations of antibodies (see Fig. 2A). Alternatively, TGase 1 or TGase 2 antigens of 3-day post-confluent NHEK cells grown in high Ca2+ were first harvested from separate affinity columns, eluted, neutralized, and concentrated, exactly as described before(21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar, 22Kim S.-Y. Yoneda K. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 103: 211-217Google Scholar). Standard TGase assays were performed by measurement of the incorporation of [3H]putrescine (Amersham) into succinylated casein(21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar). Protein assays were performed colorimetrically (Bio-Rad)(35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Samples of unlabeled active TGase species from the Mono Q FPLC experiments were used for titrations with 5 mM [14C]iodoacetamide to measure the amount of active TGase protein(13Chung S.-I. Folk J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 303-308Google Scholar, 21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar). Subsequent immunoprecipitation of the inactivated [14C]methylcarboxamide cysteine-TGase(s) with the polyclonal TGase 1, 2, or 3 antibodies enabled measurement of radioactivity incorporated, from which the amount of each TGase protein and its specific activity was then calculated(21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar). While it was possible in the present work to purify 35S-labeled TGases, direct specific activity measurements were hampered by the overlap of energies of β decay of the [35S]methionine/cysteine and [3H]putrescine isotopes. Specific activities were not measured on TGase proteins previously exposed to the low pH antibody elution buffer of either ImmunoPure beads or affinity columns. The products of some immunoprecipitation reactions using the TGase 1 antibody from the cytosolic fractions of NHEK cells, as described above, were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel run in Tricine buffers and transferred to PVDF membranes. The bands containing 2-10 pmol of the 106-, 72 (minor)-, 67-, 65 (minor)-, and 33-kDa proteins were excised, placed in a LF3500 gas-liquid phase sequencer (Porton), and run for 15 Edman degradation cycles. Released phenylthiohydantoin-derivatized amino acids were resolved and quantitated by on-line analytical high performance liquid chromatography (Beckmam Instruments, using System Gold software). The 106-kDa band initially did not give a sequence. Another sample of this band on PVDF membrane was boiled in 5.7 N HCl at 106°C in vacuo for 2 h to hydrolyze off the probable NH2-terminal blocking adduct. The acid solution was dried, redissolved in 5 μl of 50% aqueous acetonitrile, and covalently attached to a PVDF solid support (Sequelon-AA, Millipore) for sequencing. The purpose of the present experiments was to better characterize the properties of the TGase 1 system than has heretofore been possible. Our earlier work has documented significant differences in the published expression properties of the TGase 1 enzyme system using our new polyclonal antibody (21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar, 22Kim S.-Y. Yoneda K. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 103: 211-217Google Scholar) as compared with use of a commercial monoclonal antibody (B.C1)(24Michel S. Bernerd F. Jetten A.M. Floyd E.E. Shroot D. Reichert U. J. Invest.

In addition, Western blots of cytosolic fractions from NHEK cells using the polyclonal antibody recognized a major band of TGase 1 protein of 106 kDa, as well as minor bands between 70 and 90 kDa and below 50 kDa (21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar, 22Kim S.-Y. Yoneda K. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 103: 211-217Google Scholar). However, because these bands were relatively weak, in the present work we have metabolically labeled NHEK cells or human foreskin epidermis with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and immunoprecipitated the TGase proteins in order to better visualize them by autoradiography. The amount of 35S label incorporated during 4 h in cell culture was in the range of 0.5-3 × 104 dpm/108 cells. When cultured for several days post-confluence in low Ca2+ medium, under which conditions the cells do not differentiate to a significant extent(29Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1218Google Scholar), most of the TGase 1 immunoprecipitable protein was a major band of 106 kDa, as expected, as well as minor bands of about 67 and 33 kDa, and other very minor species of 70-95 and 45-65 kDa (Fig. 1A). When confluent cultures were changed to high Ca2+ medium (not shown, but see Fig. 2B, lane 1), and in the presence of the calcium ionophore A23187 (Fig. 1B), the 67- and 33-kDa forms were major products of the immunoprecipitation reaction, which increased in time as the cells differentiated. However, in order to ascertain that these bands are not due to cross-reactivity of our polyclonal TGase 1 antibody with other proteins or TGases, a series of control experiments was performed. First, we purified active 35S-labeled TGase 1, 2, and 3 enzymes from labeled foreskin epidermal cells as described (16Kim H.-C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.-C. Girard J.E. Folk J.E. Chung S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Google Scholar) (see Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:) and used them for double immunoprecipitation reactions (Fig. 2A). In the case of our polyclonal TGase 1 antibody, a second immunoprecipitation reaction was able to reprecipitate 98% of the 35S-labeled 106-kDa band from its first precipitation reaction (Fig. 2A, lane 2), but the TGase 2 antibody could only precipitate 2% (lane 3), and the TGase 3 antibody, <1% (lane 4). Likewise, the TGase 2 antibody used could reprecipitate 97% of its first reaction of 80 kDa (lane 7), but the TGase 1 and TGase 3 antibodies could precipitate only 1% or <1% (lanes 6 and 8, respectively). The TGase 3 antibody displayed a similar degree of specificity: <1% of its immunoprecipitation product of about 77 kDa could be reprecipitated by the antibodies for TGases 1 and 2 (lanes 10 and 11, respectively). Two internal controls were done: (i) the second antibody (ImmunoPure beads) used as the primary antibody bound <2% of the 35S label in each case, and (ii) each of these three antibodies could precipitate <1% of 35S-labeled actin either in the first or second precipitation reactions (data not shown). In a second series of control experiments, the TGase 1 and 2 antibodies were used harvest antigens from separate affinity columns (21Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Google Scholar, 22Kim S.-Y. Yoneda K. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 103: 211-217Google Scholar) using the cytosolic fractions of 35S-labeled confluent NHEK cells cultured in the high Ca2+ for 3 days. Then in immunoreprecipitation reactions, the TGase 1 antibody reprecipitated >95% of its first reaction of the 106, 67, and 33 kDa bands (Fig. 2B, compare lane 2 with lane 1), but the TGase 2 and 3 antibodies reprecipitated <1% and about 2% (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Likewise, the TGase 2 antibody reprecipitated most of its first reaction, but <2% could be reprecipitated by the TGase 1 antibody (compare lanes 6 and 8 with lane 7). These controls show that the three antibodies are highly specific, since they display only trace amounts of cross-reactivity, in confirmation of our earlier data(16Kim H.-C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J.

The dominant inhibitory effect of cAMP is also manifested in the suppression of subsequent cytoplasmic and nuclear activation events such as IL-2 gene expression(18Lerner A. Jackson B. Miller R.A. J.

For example, cAMP has little effect on early IL-2 secretion (21Lee M.-R. Liou M.-L. Liou M.-L. Yang Y.-F. Lai M.-Z. J.

In this study we found that MAP kinases were unexpectedly resistant to cAMP inhibition in T lymphocytes. Instead, cAMP preferentially inhibited JNK in T lymphocytes. T cell activation thus can be effectively inhibited by antagonizing a selective step (JNK) without affecting other signaling pathway (ERK).

Pollack S. Katz R. Landreth G.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2683-2689PubMed Google Scholar), the concentration used (Bt2cAMP, 100 nM) was not inhibitory for T cell activation. In the present study, the effect of cAMP on ERK was examined at the range (100 μM to 2 mM of Bt2cAMP) known to suppress T cell activation. Three different types of T cell were used: T cell hybridomas 9C12.7 (Fig. 1, A, B, and E), T lymphoma EL4 (Fig. 1C), and T lymphocytes freshly isolated from spleen (Fig. 1, D and F). Given the lag time (4 h) required for cAMP to inhibit NF-κB binding(22Chen D. Rothenberg E.V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), T cells were preincubated with Bt2cAMP for 15 min and for 4 h before Con A activation and ERK2 activity quantitation. It was found that ERK2 activity was similar between 15 min and 4 h of cAMP treatment. Only results from T cells preincubated with cAMP for 4 h are thus presented. MAP kinase activity was not affected by treatment with 0.5 mM Bt2cAMP (Fig. 1, A-D). This was distinct from the profound inhibition of IL-2 secretion by cAMP. Bt2cAMP inhibited IL-2 production at 100 μM (Fig. 1B) and largely suppressed IL-2 secretion at 0.5 mM (Fig. 1, B-D). Therefore, Con A-activated IL-2 production was inhibited by Bt2cAMP at a concentration (0.5 mM) that did not affect ERK2 in all 3 different T cells examined (Fig. 1, B-D). The profound inhibition of IL-2 by cAMP apparently was not due to an inhibition of ERK2 in T lymphocytes. It may be noted that a weak inhibition of ERK2 by the higher concentration (2 mM) of Bt2cAMP could be found in splenic T cells (Fig. 1D), but not in EL4 (Fig. 1C). Thus, there is a small discrepancy in the sensitivity of ERK2 to high concentrations of cAMP between different types of T lymphocytes. A minimal effect of cAMP was also found with TPA-induced ERK2 activation in T lymphocytes. There was a much higher increase of ERK2 activity (30-40-fold) in T cells upon TPA induction (Fig. 1F), which was accompanied by a slower migration band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1E) due to the phosphorylation of the specific threonine and tyrosine residues(33Leevers S. Marshall C. EMBO. J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of T cell hybridoma 9C12.7 with 2 mM Bt2cAMP had no effect on the mobility shift of ERK2 on PAGE (Fig. 1E). Similarly, TPA-induced MAP kinase activity was resistant to forskolin inhibition in T lymphocytes freshly isolated from spleen (Fig. 1F). ERK2 can also be activated by exogenous IL-2. The IL-2-induced ERK2 was similarly tolerant to cAMP (data not shown). Even though ERK2 is the dominant form of MAP kinase in T lymphocytes (2Whitehurst C.E. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3230-3237PubMed Google Scholar), ERK1 and ERK3 activities could be detected upon TPA activation (Fig. 2, A and B). Since different isoforms of ERK may respond differently to exogenous stimuli and regulation(34Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), we have also examined the sensitivity of TPA-induced ERK1 and ERK3 to cAMP. Both ERK1 and ERK3 were little affected by a 4-h treatment of cAMP in T lymphocytes (Fig. 2, A and B). Three different isoforms of ERK were equally resistant to cAMP inhibition. In contrast, a 15-min treatment of Bt2cAMP resulted in an effective suppression of the EGF-activated ERK2 in A431 cells (Fig. 2C). This is in accordance with the dominant inhibition of ERK by cAMP in fibroblasts, adipocytes, and muscle cells(23Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we examined whether cAMP blocks the activation of Raf-1 in T lymphocytes. The phosphorylation of Raf-1 induced by TPA/A23187 resulted in a decreased mobility when resolved on SDS-PAGE. Preincubation with 2 mM Bt2cAMP or 100 μM forskolin for 4 h had no effect on the extent of mobility shift of Raf-1 (Fig. 3A). An identical observation on c-Raf by Bt2cAMP in T cells has been reported previously(35Siegel J.N. Klausner R.D. Raff U.R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 30: 18472-18480Google Scholar). Because the mobility shift of Raf-1 does not necessarily correlate with its kinase activity(36Wartmann M. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6695-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Force T. Bonventre J.V. Heidecker G. Rapp U. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), Raf-1 was also assessed directly by the ability to phosphorylate MKK(K97M). Activation by TPA/A23187 led to an immediate increase of Raf-1 kinase activity. There was a weak inhibition of Raf-1 kinase by Bt2cAMP pretreatment (Fig. 3B), in which a 22% reduction at 0.5 mM Bt2cAMP and a 31% decrease at 2 mM Bt2cAMP were found with MKK phosphorylation. The extent of inhibition demonstrated that Raf-1 was much more sensitive to cAMP suppression than ERK2 at lower concentration of Bt2cAMP. Despite the observed inhibition, cAMP did not effectively antagonize Raf-1 at higher concentration. In contrast, activation-induced Raf-1 activity was completely suppressed by 0.5 mM Bt2cAMP in 3T3 cells (Fig. 3C). IL-2 production was much more sensitive to cAMP inhibition than Raf-1 kinase activity in T cells (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the weak antagonism of Raf-1 did not lead to a similar inhibition of ERK, and Raf-1 inhibition was not correlated with the suppression of IL-2 synthesis by cAMP. It may be noted that resistance of ERK to cAMP has also been observed in PC12 and Swiss 3T3 cells(25Burgering B.M. Th. Pronk G.J. van Weeren P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 27Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Raf activation is suppressed by cAMP in PC12 cells, and ineffectiveness of cAMP to inhibit ERK is due to the presence of cAMP-independent pathway that activates ERK(38Vaillancourt R.R. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6522-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Whether the partial inhibition of Raf-1 suggests the presence of a similar mechanism in T cells remains to be determined. The weak inhibitory effect of cAMP on MAP kinase and Raf-1 clearly distinguishes T cells from fibroblasts and other cells (Fig. 2C and 3C). The resistance of MAP kinase to PKA could in part reflect the complicated nature of T lymphocyte activation, which involves multiple signaling pathways downstream of T cell receptor complex(39Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Because the newly identified JNK defines an independent activation pathway in T lymphocytes(12Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), we examined whether it is similarly resistant to cAMP. JNK activity was not affected when T lymphocytes isolated from spleen were treated with Bt2cAMP for 15 min (Fig. 4A). Longer incubation (30 min and 1 h) with cAMP resulted in a significant suppression of JNK, in which a 40% decrease was found with 0.5 mM Bt2cAMP treatment. Two-hour incubation with 0.5 mM cAMP inhibited nearly 70% of JNK activity (Fig. 4A). Further incubation did not lead to additional suppression (data not shown for 4-h treatment). Such a delayed antagonism of JNK by cAMP is also illustrated by the progressive shift of dose-inhibition curves (Fig. 4B). A nearly complete inhibition of JNK was found with T lymphoma EL4 after 2-h incubation with Bt2cAMP (Fig. 4C). Treatment with forskolin for 2 h also led to a similar inhibition of JNK in splenic T lymphocytes (Fig. 5A). The decrease in JNK activity was well correlated with the reduction in IL-2 production by cAMP in both splenic T lymphocytes and EL4 (Fig. 6).Figure 5:The inhibition of JNK by cAMP was prevented by cycloheximide and actinomycin D. A, splenic T cells were pretreated with forskolin (FSK) at the concentrations indicated for 15 min or for 2 h before activation with TPA/A23187. 20 μg/ml each of cycloheximide (CHX) or actinomycin D (Act.D) was added together with forskolin as indicated. Cell extracts were prepared and JNK assays were performed as described in Fig. 4A. B, the protein levels of JNK were not affected by cAMP. Cell extracts were prepared from splenic T lymphocytes pretreated with Bt2cAMP at the concentrations indicated for 2 h, and were resolved on SDS-PAGE, blotted, and detected with antibody specific for JNK2 (N-19, Santa Cruz Biotech). A similar result was obtained with antibody reacted with both JNK1 and JNK2 (FL, Santa Cruz Biotech) (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6:Comparison between the JNK activity and the IL-2 production in the presence of cAMP. JNK activity was determined in Fig. 4. Activation-induced IL-2 secretion was determined as described in Fig. 1.

A, T lymphocytes from spleen; B, EL4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The delayed suppression of JNK in T cells follows kinetics similar to that for the inhibition on the binding of NF-κB, a major transcriptional element on the IL-2 promoter(22Chen D. Rothenberg E.V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Together with an almost identical correlation between the dose of Bt2cAMP and the extent of suppression for both IL-2 and JNK (Fig. 6), it may be suggested that the inhibition of IL-2 synthesis by cAMP is mediated by the antagonism of JNK in T lymphocytes. The molecular mechanism underlying the progressive inhibition of JNK remains unclear. JNK1 and JNK2 are equally present in T cells(12Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), and their protein levels were not affected by 2-h treatment of Bt2cAMP (Fig. 5B for JNK2, data not shown for JNK1), suggesting the inhibition was not due to a suppression of JNK synthesis by cAMP. In contrast, new RNA and protein synthesis were apparently required for the inhibition of JNK by cAMP, as demonstrated by the increased JNK activity and the reduced sensitivity of JNK to cAMP inhibition in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide (Fig. 5A). Presumably, the suppression of JNK was mediated by the newly synthesized inhibitor(s) stimulated by cAMP. The slow inhibition of JNK is distinct from the observation that a 15-min cAMP incubation is enough to effectively suppress ERK2 in A431 cells (Fig. 2C). Such rapid inhibition of MAP kinase cascade is ascribed to an inactivation of Raf-1 by PKA phosphorylation in other type of cells (23Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 24Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 25Burgering B.M. Th.

Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The requirement of protein synthesis and the slow inhibitory kinetics may suggest a lower likelihood of a direct phosphorylation of JNK by PKA in T cells. It may be noted that the kinase cascade leading to the activation of JNK has recently been identified in a number of cells(8Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.J. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 9Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). It is possible that the stage inhibited by cAMP is located upstream of JNK. Identification of the exact stage that cAMP inhibits which results in JNK inhibition may provide clues to our understanding of the nuclear suppressive effect of cAMP in T lymphocytes. T cell activation events represent a full integration of signals from different pathways. Raf-1 and JNK each define one of the signaling pathways downstream of Ras(3Downward J. Graves J. Cantrell D.

Both pathways are critical for T cell activation, as competitive inhibition of either Raf-1 or JNK blocks IL-2 gene activation(12Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 14Owaki H. Varma R. Gillis B. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Davis L.S. Geppert T.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4367-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The induction of ERK2 by TPA alone does not activate T cells, while a costimulatory signal is required for JNK induction as well as for T cell activation(12Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the observation that activation of JNK by TPA in fibroblasts does not require A23187(12Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). In the present study, cAMP is shown to inhibit JNK but not MAP kinase in T lymphocytes, yet T cell activation is effectively suppressed. This supports a specific role of JNK in T cell activation, and is consistent with the suggestion that JNK activation represents a stage at which different T cell activation signals are integrated(12Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Hence, T cell activation can be blocked by cAMP at this step without affecting another essential pathway (MAP kinase cascade). Interestingly, JNK is stimulated by UV (7Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar) or tumor necrosis factor(8Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.J. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), the stimulus that also activates NF-κB(40Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Both the binding of NF-κB (22Chen D. Rothenberg E.V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and the activation of JNK (Fig. 4) are antagonized by cAMP in T lymphocytes, and the inhibition time courses of NF-κB (22Chen D. Rothenberg E.V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and JNK (Fig. 4A) are strikingly similar. Whether this implicates a direct involvement of JNK in the activation of NF-κB is currently under investigation.

In fact, p21 can directly inhibit the initiation of SV40 viral DNA synthesis by neutralizing proliferating cell nuclear antigen activity (89Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication in the Xenopus system by p21 coincides with an inhibition of Cdk2 cyclin-dependent kinases (78Strausfeld U.P. Howell M. Rempel R. Maller J.L. Hunt T. Blow J.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 876-883Google Scholar). Although sequence-specific transcriptional activation appears to represent an important role for p53, it has also been established that p53 binds to TBP (73Seto E. Usheva A. Zambetti G.P. Momand J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13062-13067Google Scholar) and can inhibit transcription through TATA-dependent (48Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins L.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Google Scholar) and TATA-independent mechanisms (31Hernandez N. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Google Scholar; 82Ueba T. Nosaka T. Takahashi J.A. Shibata F. Florkieeicz R.Z. Vogelstein B. Oda Y. Kikuchi H. Hatanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9009-9013Google Scholar), presumably by interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery. Regulation of p53 protein function remains less well understood. p53 protein is normally undetectable by immunohistochemical analysis in most tissue cells (29Hall P.A. McKee P.H. Menage H. Dover R. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 203-207Google Scholar; 28Hall P.A. Lane D.P. J. Pathol. 1994; 172: 1-4Google Scholar). The stability and activity of p53 is dramatically elevated in the nucleus of some cells following DNA damage (49Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Google Scholar; 36Kastan M.B.

Biol. 1993; 156: 107-116Google Scholar), but the gene products regulating these pathways are not well defined. Extragenic factors appear to control the stability of p53 as suggested by the observation that cells derived from some patients with Bloom's syndrome fail to induce the endogenous wild type p53 following DNA damage (46Lu X. Lane D.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 765-778Google Scholar), and some patients with an inherited predisposition to cancer produce abnormally high levels of wild type p53 in normal cells in the absence of exogenous damage (7Barnes D.M. Hanby A.M. Gillett C.E. Mohammed S. Hodgson S. Bobrow L.G. Leigh I.M. Purkis T. MacGeoch C. Spurr N.K. Bartek J. Vojtesek B. Picksley S.M. Lane D.P.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1635-1643Google Scholar), as at least seven kinases have been shown to modify p53, including casein kinase II (55Meek D.W. Simon S. Kikkawa U. Eckhart W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3253-3260Google Scholar), Cdc-2 (11Bischoff J.R. Friedman P.N. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4766-4770Google Scholar; 2Addison C. Jenkins J. Sturzbecher H.W. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 423-426Google Scholar), casein kinase I-isozyme (60Milne D.M. Palmer R.H. Campell D.G. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1361-1370Google Scholar), protein kinase C (9Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Google Scholar), DNA-activated protein kinase (Lees-Miller et al., 1990), mitogen-activated protein kinase (62Milne D.M. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260Google Scholar), and JNK1 (63Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. Campbell D.G. Meek D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5511-5518Google Scholar). The regulatory significance of these modifications is only beginning to be unraveled. Mutation of an NH2-terminal DNA-activated protein kinase phosphorylation site reduces the ability of p53 to inhibit cell cycle progression (21Fiscella M. Ullrich S.J. Zambrano N. Shields M.T. Lin D. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C. Mercer W.E. Appella E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1519-1528Google Scholar). Mutating the COOH-terminal casein kinase II phosphorylation site of mouse p53 inactivates its growth suppressor activity in rodent cell lines (61Milne D.M. Palmer R.H. Meek D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5565-5569Google Scholar). Direct evidence that phosphorylation can control the activity of human p53 has been supported by biochemical studies showing that two distinct protein kinases (protein kinase C and casein kinase II) can activate the latent sequence-specific DNA binding function of p53 in vitro (32Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Google Scholar, 34Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Google Scholar; 17Delphin C. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29579-29587Google Scholar). These results suggest that p53 has evolved a functionally relevant interaction with different enzymes and that distinct kinases may activate p53 in vivo. Direct evidence linking the activation of a kinase to the activation of p53 protein sequence-specific DNA binding in a physiologically relevant system has not been observed. However, a role for protein kinase C in the activation of the DNA binding function of p53 in vivo is compelling, based on two independent lines of evidence. The first relies on the identification of biochemical forms of p53 synthesized in vivo which are modified post-translationally at the protein kinase C site. Protein kinase C phosphorylation of p53 in vitro inhibits the binding of a monoclonal antibody (PAb421), whose binding site overlaps the protein kinase C phosphorylation site in the regulatory domain of p53 (34Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Google Scholar; 17Delphin C. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29579-29587Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have also revealed that activation of the specific DNA binding function of p53 in vivo is coincident with post-translational modification at the protein kinase C site, as indicated by lack of reactivity to PAb421 antibody (35Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Google Scholar; 17Delphin C. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29579-29587Google Scholar). PAb421 non-reactivity is also observed on p53 synthesized in vivo from inducible expression vectors which lead to a growth arrest in glioblastoma cells (84Ullrich S.J. Anderson C.W. Mercer W.E. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15259-15262Google Scholar; 22Fiscella M. Zambrano N. Ullrich S.J. Unger T. Lin D. Cho B. Mercer W.E. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3249-3257Google Scholar), suggesting that an enzyme with a specificity for the protein kinase C site modifies the induced form of p53 during growth arrest. The second experimental evidence relies on the observation that the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate can induce a G1/S growth arrest of transformed cells harboring a functional p53 allele (74Skouv J. Ostrup-Jensen P. Forchhammer J. Larsen J.K. Lund L.R. Cell Growth Diff. 1994; 5: 329-340Google Scholar; 17Delphin C. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29579-29587Google Scholar), presumably by modification of p53 by protein kinase C. Although these data provide evidence that protein kinase C is involved in p53 activation in cells, it does not distinguish between the 12 isoforms of protein kinase C which exist, nor other enzymes that may covalently modify serine residues at the canonical protein kinase C site. In contrast to protein kinase C, a link between the induction of a casein kinase II-dependent pathway and the activation of the sequence-specific DNA binding function of p53 in vivo has not been established. Casein kinase II is a highly conserved serine-threonine protein kinase that is constitutively expressed in all eukaryotic cell types examined, including yeast, insects, and vertebrates. The enzyme is a heterotetramer composed of two α and two β subunits and can utilize GTP or ATP as a phosphate donor (70Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanism of casein kinase II regulation is not well understood, as the kinase does not undergo reversible inactivation/activation in response to growth factors and mitogens like many second messenger-dependent protein kinases. However, biochemical and physiological studies have revealed two points of potential regulation. Enzymatic analysis has revealed that association of the catalytic core α subunit with the β subunit can regulate the activity of the kinase. The β subunit contains the binding site of basic effectors like spermine and polylysine (54Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Issinger O.G. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4336-4342Google Scholar), the interaction with which stimulates substrate phosphorylation by the α subunit. Although the β subunit stimulates the activity of the α subunit for most substrates, β actually inhibits kinase activity toward calmodulin (53Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Marin O. Marchiori F. Perich J.W. Issinger O. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 939-945Google Scholar). Casein kinase II associates with the nuclear matrix (79Tawfic S. Ahmed K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7489-7493Google Scholar), and nuclear fractions contain pools of free α and free β subunit, which are differentially solubilized by NaCl in vitro (77Stigare J. Buddelmeijer N. Pigon A. Egyhazi E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 129: 77-85Google Scholar). Physiological studies have also revealed that the β subunit is degraded much more rapidly than the α subunit (47Luscher B. Litchfield D.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 521-526Google Scholar). Thus, if casein kinase II activity is regulated, the most likely candidate at present would be its β subunit; rate-limiting assembly of the heterotetramer can dramatically modulate the specific activity of the kinase. A series of recent reports has demonstrated that physiological regulation can be observed under specific conditions; casein kinase II activity is stimulated by mitogens (75Sommercorn J. Mulligan J.A. Lozeman F.J. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8834-8838Google Scholar), after heat shock (85van Delft S. Coffer P. Kruijer W. vanWijk R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 542-548Google Scholar), in a cell type-specific manner during development and embryogenesis (57Mestres P. Boldyreff B. Ebensperger C. Hameister H. Issinger O.G. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1994; 149: 13-20Google Scholar), and its activity is strikingly elevated in human squamous cell carcinoma or in adenocarcinoma of the lung (15Daya-Makin M. Sanghera J.J. Mogentale T.L. Lipp M. Parchomchuk J. Hogg J.C. Pelech S.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 15: 2262-2268Google Scholar) and up to 25-fold in prostatic hyperplasia (92Yenice S. Davis A.T. Goueli S.A. Akdas A. Limas C. Ahmed K. Prostate. 1994; 24: 11-16Google Scholar). Although casein kinase II has been implicated in the regulation of growth control based on its phosphorylation of key proteins and enzymes, only a few examples exist in which the kinase can modulate the biochemical activity of a protein, including topoisomerase II (1Ackerman P. Glover C.V.C. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12653-12660Google Scholar), topoisomerase I (81Turman M.A. Douvas A. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1993; 50: 210-225Google Scholar), CREM (16deGroot R.P. den Hertog J. Vandenheede J.R. Goris J. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3903-3911Google Scholar), SRF (50Manak J.R. deBisschop N.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3211-3220Google Scholar), and p53 (32Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanism whereby casein kinase II alters polypeptide structure in these situations is not defined. p53 is an allosterically regulated tetramer, which can be reversibly activated by multi-site phosphorylation of its negative regulatory domain (35Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Google Scholar). As the carboxyl-terminal casein kinase II site of p53 is the only phosphorylation site on p53 that is highly conserved at the primary amino acid level, understanding the mechanism whereby casein kinase II activates p53 provides a unique opportunity to study how phosphorylation affects allosteric regulation of a DNA-binding protein. Reported here, using a eukaryotic cell line that we now show can be used to produce correctly folded forms of both latent and activated p53 and using a chromatographic method to separate three forms of p53 produced in vivo, are data demonstrating that (i) two distinct signaling pathways are involved in p53 activation in the same cell line, (ii) the acidic casein kinase II site is required for catalytic activation of p53 by casein kinase II in vitro, and (iii) casein kinase II-independent activation of p53 can occur in vivo. Recombinant p53 and monoclonal antibodies DO-1, PAb421, PAb1620, PAb240, and ICA-9 were purified as described (35Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Google Scholar). Heparin-Sepharose, MonoQ (SR 5/5), and Superose 12-gel filtration columns were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Phosphocellulose P-11 was obtained from Whatman. The DnaK overproducing strain was obtained from Dr. Maciej Zylicz, Gdansk, Poland. Mutagenesis kits were obtained from Amersham Corp. Buffer B contains 15% glycerol, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), and 0.1 mM EDTA. Insect cell growth media is Ex-cell 400 (Sera-Lab) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Casein kinase II from rabbit muscle was purified as described (32Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Google Scholar) with the following changes. Muscle from one rabbit was ground in 1 liter of homogenization buffer (4 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolBSAbovine serum albuminELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 1 1 mM benzamidine) and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 50 min. The soluble supernatant containing 20 g of protein was batch adsorbed to 100 ml of phosphocellulose resin for 2 h in Buffer F (10% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, and 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 50 mM KCl. The column was washed with Buffer F containing 0.35 M KCl, and casein kinase II activity was step eluted with Buffer F containing 1.2 M KCl and 0.05% Triton X-100. After phosphocellulose, fractions containing casein kinase II were applied to a heparin-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear gradient from 0.05 to 1 M KCl in Buffer F containing 0.05% Triton X-100. Active fractions were applied to a MonoQ column and eluted with a linear KCl gradient in Buffer F containing 0.1% Triton X-100 from 0.1 M KCl to 0.66 M KCl. Active casein kinase II was concentrated to 0.25 mg/ml using Centricon-30, BSA was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and kinase was stored frozen in liquid nitrogen. Casein kinase activity was monitored during the purification by assaying for radioactive phosphate incorporation into p53 and casein (10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml BSA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mM DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 M KCl, and 25 ng of p53 or 500 ng of casein) in the absence and presence of PAb421 (200 ng). PAb421 binds near the casein kinase II site of p53 and reduces the rate of phosphorylation, providing a method to access casein kinase II dependence during purification (32Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Google Scholar). dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Escherichia coli Hsp70 homologue (DnaK) was purified from an overproducing strain by a modification of the published protocol (33Hupp T.R. Meek D.M. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3167-3174Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB media at 30°C to an optical density of 0.6, at which point an equal volume of prewarmed LB (55°C) was added and cells were grown for an additional 2 h at 42°C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 10% sucrose, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), and the cell suspension was lysed by the addition of KCl to 0.5 M, DTT to 1 mM, and lysozyme to 0.5 mg/ml. After a 20-min incubation at 0°C and centrifugation for 10 min in a minicentrifuge, crude lysate was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column at a protein(mg):resin(ml) ratio of 10:1. Bound protein was eluted and fractions containing DnaK, localized by immunoblotting, were dialyzed against Buffer D (10 mM imidazole (pH 7.0), 10% sucrose, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 20 mM KCl, and 1 mM DTT) and applied to an ATP-agarose column (Sigma A-2682) in Buffer D at a protein(mg):resin(ml) ratio of 5:1. After a wash in Buffer D containing 1.0 M KCl, and equilibration in Buffer D, DnaK was eluted from the column using Buffer D containing 5 mM ATP. The fractions of DnaK eluting from ATP-agarose were dialyzed overnight at 3°C against Buffer B containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.25 M KCl. Protein immunoblotting was performed as described (30Harlow E.E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). ELISA was performed by first coating plates with p53 or p53Δ4 at 2 μg/ml in sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0) for 1 h at 22°C and subsequently developing the ELISA with monoclonal antibodies as indicated (30Harlow E.E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Two-site ELISA was performed by first coating wells with pure monoclonal antibody at 2 μg/ml in carbonate buffer (pH 9.0) at 4°C for 16 h. After coating the non-reacted sites with BPT buffer (5% BSA, phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1% Tween 20), p53 was detected with polyclonal serum CM-1 as indicated in Fig. 3 legend. A 20-amino acid synthetic peptide derived from the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of p53 (40 μg; GQSTSRHKKLMFKTEPDSD) was coupled to 400 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used as an antigen for the eventual generation of hybridoma cell lines (30Harlow E.E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) secreting antibodies specific for p53. Detection of antibodies to p53 involved the use of pure human p53 in an ELISA. The specificity of ICA-9 for the COOH-terminal casein kinase II site was established by immunoblotting with p53 lacking the casein kinase II site (Fig. 5) and by using synthetic peptides in a competition ELISA assay. 2T. Hupp and D. Lane, unpublished observations. 2 The antibody was classed as IgG1 and purified for biochemical studies using Protein A and gel filtration chromatography. Single-stranded pBSK vector DNA harboring the wild type human p53 gene (58Midgley C.A. Fisher C.J. Bartek J. Vojtesek B. Lane D.P. Barnes D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 183-189Google Scholar) was used as a template for deletion mutagenesis designed to remove the final four amino acids of p53. The resultant allele was subcloned into the T7.7 expression vector for overproduction in and purification from E. coli as indicated (35Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Google Scholar) or was subcloned into pVL1393 baculovirus expression vector and used to isolate recombinant virus overproducing p53Δ4 in Sf9 insect cells as described by the manufacturer of insect cell expression systems (Invitrogen). p53 (6-12 ng) was added to 10 μl of Activation buffer (10% glycerol, 1.0 mg/ml BSA, 0.05 M KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ATP (or 50 μM ATP when activated using protein kinases), and 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.6)), followed by incubation at 30°C for 30 min with 25 ng of PAb421, 50 ng of casein kinase II (MonoQ fraction; Hupp and Lane, 1994) from rabbit muscle, or 2 μg of DnaK. Reactions containing activated p53 were placed at 0°C, and 10 μl of a DNA binding buffer (20% glycerol, 1.0 mg/ml BSA, 0.05 M KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ATP, 5 ng of radiolabeled consensus site oligonucleotide (32Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Google Scholar), and 100 ng of supercoiled pBluescript competitor DNA) was added. After an incubation on ice for 15 min, reaction products were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (in 0.5 × TB buffer and 0.1% Triton X-100) by electrophoresis at 200 V for 3 h at 8°C. Gels were dried prior to exposure to x-ray film. Recombinant p53 assembles into predominantly latent tetramers in bacterial or mammalian cell lines (32Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of p53 is rate-limiting in some cells or that activated p53 is preferentially degraded. Activation of the latent sequence-specific DNA binding function of p53 function in vitro is catalyzed by protein kinase C, casein kinase II, or a monoclonal antibody (PAb421, which binds to the protein kinase C site). DnaK protein, whose binding site adventitiously overlaps with the PAb421 binding site 3T. Hupp and D. Lane, unpublished observations. 3 (23Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Google Scholar), also activates the latent DNA binding function of p53 (32Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Google Scholar). These four proteins all target specific amino acids in the COOH-terminal negative regulatory domain (Fig. 1B), suggesting that activation of p53 by these diverse reagents occurs through a common biochemical mechanism. By contrast to other cell lines, insect cells infected with recombinant p53 baculovirus produce relatively large amounts of in vivo activated p53 (34Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Google Scholar, 35Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Google Scholar). As such, this cell line provides an excellent model system with which to study the signaling pathways that can activate the specific DNA binding function of"
https://openalex.org/W1991246265,"To characterize the structural basis for the interactions between the insulin receptor (IR) and its major substrate, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), a segment of the NH2-terminal region of IRS-1 (Pro5-Pro65) was deleted. This region contains the first four conserved boxes of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, located at the NH2-terminal part of IRS-1. COS-7 cells were then cotransfected with the genes coding for IR and a wild-type (WT) or a mutated form of IRS-1. IRS-1ΔPH underwent significantly reduced insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation compared with WT IRS-1. The reduced in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1ΔPH was accompanied by reduced association between IRS-1ΔPH and its downstream effector p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. In contrast, both WT IRS-1 and IRS-1ΔPH underwent comparable insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro when incubated with partially purified insulin receptor kinase. These findings suggest that the overall structure of IRS-1 is not altered by deletion of its PH domain and that the PH domain is not the main site for protein-protein interactions between the insulin receptor and IRS-1, at least in vitro. In conclusion, the PH region might facilitate in vivo binding of IRS-1 to membrane phospholipids or other cellular constituents in close proximity to the IR, whereas the actual interactions with the IR are presumably mediated through other domains of the IRS-1 molecule. This could account for the fact that partial deletion of the PH domain selectively impairs the in vivo interactions between the insulin receptor and IRS-1, whereas their in vitro interactions remain unaffected."

One of the few proteins thiophosphorylated under these conditions is the 130-kDa subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase.

https://openalex.org/W2024819037,"5-Lipoxygenase of mouse macrophages and bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) was investigated. Indirect immunocytofluorescence combined with confocal microscopy provided evidence for distinct intracellular expression patterns and trafficking of 5-lipoxygenase upon cellular activation. In resting BMMC, 5-lipoxygenase was found within the nucleus co-localizing with the nuclear stain Yo-Pro-1. When BMMC were IgE/antigen-activated the 5-lipoxygenase immunofluorescence pattern was changed from nuclear to perinuclear. The absence of divalent cations in the incubation medium, or calcium ionophore A23187 challenge, altered the predominantly nuclear expression pattern to new sites both cytosolic and intranuclear. The cDNA for murine macrophage 5-lipoxygenase was cloned by the polymerase chain reaction and would predict a 674 amino acid protein. Using control cells obtained from 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice it was determined that a single isoform accounts for both soluble and membrane-bound and nuclear and cytosolic-localized enzyme in macrophages and BMMC. A mutation at amino acid 672 (Val ⟶ Met) introduced serendipitously during the cloning process was found to completely abolish 5-lipoxygenase enzyme activity when the enzyme was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. This subtle change is proposed to affect the ability of the COOH-terminal isoleucine to coordinate the essential non-heme iron atom. In macrophages and BMMC obtained from 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice, compensatory changes in expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of leukotriene B4 were investigated. 5-Lipoxygenase-activating protein expression was reduced by 50%, while leukotriene A4 hydrolase expression was unaltered. The 5-lipoxygenase gene was mapped to the central region of mouse chromosome 6 in a region that shares homology with human chromosome 10 by interspecific backcross analysis.

The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (arachidonate:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.11.34) catalyzes the formation of 5-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE)1 1The abbreviations used are: 5-H(P)ETE5-hydro(pero)xy-eicosatetraenoic acidLTleukotrieneFLAP5-lipoxygenase-activating proteinBMMCbone marrow-derived mast cellPCRpolymerase chain reactionHEKhuman embryonic kidneyRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsDNP-BSAdinitrophenyl bovine serum albumin13-H(P)ODE13-hydro(pero)xy-octadecadienoic acidRP-HPLCreversed phase-high performance liquid chromatographykbkilobase(s). and its subsequent conversion to leukotriene (LT)A4 (5,6-oxido-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid). LTA4 is a pivotal intermediate in the biosynthesis of inflammatory and anaphylactic mediators which include leukotriene B4 (5S,12R)-dihydroxy-6,14-cis-8,10-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid and the peptidyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4; see Refs. 1, 2 for reviews). In human neutrophils, 5-lipoxygenase undergoes a Ca2+-dependent translocation from the cytosol to a membrane site which appears to be the nuclear envelope(3Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol.

In alveolar macrophages there is evidence for the existence of two 5-lipoxygenase “pools,” cytosolic and membrane-bound forms(7Coffey M. Peters-Golden M. Fantone J.C. Sporn P.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 570-576Google Scholar). Recent data by the same investigators has established nuclear soluble and nuclear bound 5-lipoxygenase expression patterns in rat basophilic leukemia cells(8Brock T.G. Paine R. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Google Scholar). Lepley and Fitzpatrick (9Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24163-24168Google Scholar) have obtained in vitro data that 5-lipoxygenase can bind to cytoskeletal proteins and the signaling protein Grb2 via an SH3-binding domain interaction. Thus, in addition to the carrier-mediated export of leukotrienes(10Lam B.K. Owen Jr., W.F. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12885-12889Google Scholar, 11Lam B.K. Gagnon L. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13438-13441Google Scholar), the concept is emerging that 5-lipoxygenase may have novel intracellular functions, possibly independent of leukotriene biosynthesis, and its intracellular location may be dictated by specific protein-protein interactions. cDNAs encoding the human (12Matsumoto T.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2587-2591Google Scholar) has been elucidated. Recently, in our efforts to better understand the biology of 5-lipoxygenase and leukotrienes we created 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice by gene targeting(16Funk C.D. Kurre U. Griffis G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 714: 253-258Google Scholar, 17Chen X.-S. Sheller J.R. Johnson E. Funk C.D. Nature. 1994; 372: 179-181Google Scholar). We realized the importance of ascertaining more clearly the existence, or not, of 5-lipoxygenase isoforms and their relationship to distinct intracellular pools of 5-lipoxygenase in resting and activated cells. Our studies have focused primarily on bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) and macrophages. Here we show evidence for different 5-lipoxygenase intracellular locations depending on the state of cell activation in BMMC. Moreover, studies with 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice show that the different 5-lipoxygenase pools in alveolar macrophages derive from the same gene product. Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of the amino acid residue two positions upstream of the carboxyl terminus for 5-lipoxygenase activity, the chromosomal location of the murine 5-lipoxygenase gene, and studies with macrophages and BMMC of 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice designed to examine compensatory expression of other proteins key to the formation of leukotrienes (FLAP and LTA4 hydrolase). C57BL/6 × 129 mixed genetic background mice were maintained in the animal barrier facility of Vanderbilt University on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with water and food provided ad libitum. The generation of 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice has been described(17Chen X.-S. Sheller J.R. Johnson E. Funk C.D. Nature. 1994; 372: 179-181Google Scholar). BMMC were prepared from cells flushed from femurs and tibiae of wild-type and 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice and were cultured in the presence of 50% WEHI-3b conditioned medium, 50% RPMI 1640 (complete medium) for 3-6 weeks(18Razin E. Mencia-Huerta J.-M. Stevens R.L. Lewis R.A. Liu F.-T. Corey E.J. Austen K.F. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 189-201Google Scholar). Cell purity estimated by cell morphology and staining with toluidine blue was 90-95%. Peritoneal macrophages (19Cohn Z.A. Benson B. J. Exp. Med. 1965; 121: 153-170Google Scholar) were obtained by lavage from the peritoneal cavity with 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5 units/ml heparin. Cells were plated in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C in tissue culture dishes. After adherence for 1 h, the cells were washed three times and used for experiments. Cell purity was estimated to be >97% based on cell morphology and staining with nonspecific esterase. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages were isolated by a published procedure(20Rouzer C.A. Scott W.A. Hamill A.L. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 155: 720-733Google Scholar). Cultured BMMC obtained from wild-type and 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice were washed three times with modified Tyrode's buffer (contains 0.32 mM Ca2+; (18Razin E. Mencia-Huerta J.-M. Stevens R.L. Lewis R.A. Liu F.-T. Corey E.J. Austen K.F. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 189-201Google Scholar)) at 4°C. One group of cells was sensitized with monoclonal IgE directed against DNP-human serum albumin (Sigma; 100 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37°C, followed by three washes, and subsequent incubation with DNP-BSA (50 ng/ml) for 30 min. Other groups of cells were incubated with calcium ionophore A23187 (0.5 μM), EDTA (2 mM) or no additions for 30 min in modified Tyrode's. The cells were quickly washed two times with complete medium, with or without EDTA, at 4°C. Cells were placed on glass microscope slides using a Shandon cytocentrifuge (550 revolutions/min for 5 min). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min followed by 5% donkey serum for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. The cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-5-lipoxygenase antiserum (1:2500 dilution; see below) for 5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The slides were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 1:4000 dilution). The slides were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the nuclear stain Yo-Pro-1 (Molecular Probes; 1:5000 dilution) for 15 min. The slides were air-dried and mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences Inc.). Slides were examined under oil immersion with a Zeiss LSM410 laser scanning confocal microscope using ×40 or ×63 objectives. Excitation/emission settings were 543/650 nm (HeNe laser) for Cy3 and 488/520 nm for Yo-Pro-1 (ArKr laser). Raw data images were processed further using Adobe Photoshop (MacIntosh) and Showcase (Silicon Graphics Indigo2) programs. Cells were sonicated for two bursts of 15 s on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4°C. Soluble and pellet fractions were obtained. Protein was quantitated by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad reagent) and prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described in the Fig. 5 legend using previously characterized polyclonal anti-human 5-lipoxygenase, FLAP and leukotriene A4 hydrolase antisera, and purified recombinant human 5-lipoxygenase as standard (generous gifts of Dr. J. Evans, Merck Frosst). Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence combined with autoradiography using reagents from Amersham Corp. Relative band densities were estimated by densitometric analysis of x-ray films using Image 1.38 software (Wayne Rasburn, NIH, Bethesda, MD). BMMC (107 cells) in 1 ml of modified Tyrode's buffer were incubated in the presence and absence of 0.5 μM A23187, or IgE/antigen for 20 or 30 min at 37°C as described above. No exogenous arachidonic acid was added. Incubations were terminated with 4 volumes of ethanol, extracted with ODS-silica columns, and products were separated by RP-HPLC as described(17Chen X.-S. Sheller J.R. Johnson E. Funk C.D. Nature. 1994; 372: 179-181Google Scholar). To isolate the complete coding region for the murine 5-lipoxygenase cDNA degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on the known human and rat sequences (12Matsumoto T. Funk C.D. Rdmark O. Hg J.-O.

Two additional primers were prepared based on on the sequence we had obtained from a genomic clone containing exons 4-6 of the murine gene (Primer 3, 5′-ATGGATGGAGTGGAACCCCGG-3′ and Primer 4, 5′-CTGTACTTCCTGTTCTAAACT-3′). RNA was prepared by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Total RNA (1 μg) obtained from resident peritoneal macrophages of C57BL/6 × 129 F1 mice was used as the starting material for reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) carried out by standard procedures(22Funk C.D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12508-12513Google Scholar). Amplification conditions for primer 2/primer 3 set using one-fifth of the cDNA mixture were: 94°C, 45 s; 46°C, 45 s; 72°C, 1 min 30 s for 35 cycles. A 1.6 kb band was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and glass powder extraction (Qiagen), and an aliquot was reamplified for an additional 25 cycles. A 0.8-kb product was amplified using primer 1/primer 4 set using the same conditions mentioned above except without subsequent reamplification. Both PCR products were cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), and the inserts were entirely sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. An expression construct (m5LO/Met672) was prepared in the pcDNA1 vector (Invitrogen) by ligation of the two PCR-generated 5-lipoxygenase cDNA fragments. First, the 5′ end of the 5-lipoxygenase cDNA was inserted into the vector as an EcoRI (polylinker derived)/EcoRV 0.5-kb fragment. After verification of the preceding construct, the 3′ end was inserted as an EcoRV/NsiI (polylinker site) 1.5-kb fragment. DNA purified by ion-exchange resin (Qiagen) was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells as described previously by the calcium phosphate method(23Chen X.-S. Brash A.R. Funk C.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 845-852Google Scholar, 24Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McGray G. DNA, Protein Engin. Techniques. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar). 48 h later enzyme activity was assayed(25Funk C.D. Gunne H. Steiner H. Izumi T. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2592-2596Google Scholar). A second construct was also prepared for expression studies. The codon for Met672 in the original 3′ end PCR product was changed to Val672 in a PCR reaction using primers 5 and 6 (Fig. 1; 5′-AAGTCTAGATTTAGATGGCCACACTGTTTGG-3′ and 5′-TTCAAGCTGCTGGTA-3′; altered base is underlined and restriction site for cloning is italics). The change was verified by DNA sequencing, and a 0.4-kb PstI/XbaI fragment was replaced into m5LO/Met672 to produce m5LO/Met672Val. Authenticity of the construct was checked by restriction site mapping and DNA sequencing. Subsequently, a 3′ RACE protocol using an oligo(dT) adapter-primer and primer 7 (5′-ATCAGCGTGATCGCCGAG-3′) with newly synthesized cDNA was employed to verify the codon at position 672. Interspecific backcross mapping was performed as described (26Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Google Scholar) by using progeny generated from mating (C57BL/6J × Mus spretus)F1 females and C57BL/6J males. A total of 205 N2 mice were used to map the Alox5 locus (see “Results” for details). DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blot transfer, and hybridization were performed as essentially described(27Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Taylor B.A. Lee B.K. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 26-36Google Scholar). The probe was a 403-base pair cDNA (bases 432-834) derived by PCR with primer 3/primer 4 set, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a nick translation labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Washing was done to a final stringency of 1.0 × SSCP, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. A fragment of 3.8 kb was detected in HindIII-digested C57BL/6J (B) DNA, and a fragment of 10.0 kb was detected in HindIII-digested M. spretus (S) DNA. The presence or absence of the 10.0-kb HindIII M. spretus-specific fragment was followed in backcross mice. A description of the probes and restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the loci linked to the Alox5 locus including microphthalmia (mi), ras-related fibrosarcoma oncogene (Raf1), and ret proto-oncogene (Ret) has been reported previously(28Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Arnheiter H. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Google Scholar, 29Hogan A. Heyner S. Charron M.J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Thorens B. Schultz G.A. Development. 1991; 113: 363-372Google Scholar). Recombination distances were calculated as described (30Green E.L. Genetics and Probability in Animal Breeding Experiments. Oxford University Press, New York1981: 77-113Google Scholar) using the computer program SPRETUS MADNESS. Gene order was determined by minimizing the number of recombination events required to explain the allele distribution patterns. Previously, we had isolated a mouse genomic 5-lipoxygenase clone that coded for a small region of 5-lipoxygenase(16Funk C.D. Kurre U. Griffis G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 714: 253-258Google Scholar). To examine potential 5-lipoxygenase isoforms, we sought to clone the complete murine 5-lipoxygenase cDNA by RT-PCR from macrophage RNA. Two overlapping fragments were obtained (Fig. 1). The 2.0-kb cDNA encodes a protein of 674 amino acids (including the initiator Met residue) with a molecular weight of 78,000. Various PCR primer combinations revealed no evidence for splice variants by agarose gel electrophoresis size selection of amplified products and subsequent sequence analysis. Moreover, hybridization of mouse genomic DNA with various 5-lipoxygenase cDNA restriction fragments under reduced stringency conditions did not reveal cross-hybridizing bands or complex band patterns (data not shown). These results are consistent with our previous data that there is only a single 5-lipoxygenase gene(16Funk C.D. Kurre U. Griffis G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 714: 253-258Google Scholar). An expression construct (m5LO/Met672) was prepared by splicing together the two PCR fragments at an unique EcoRV site (Fig. 1). Introduction of this expression vector into human embryonic kidney 293 cells led to expression of immunoreactive 5-lipoxygenase protein of the correct size, but devoid of enzyme activity (Fig. 2). Alignment of the mouse sequence with human and rat sequences and examination of the primer 2 sequence indicated a PCR-based error in the codon for the amino acid two residues from the COOH terminus (amino acid 672), a residue that is conserved in most mammalian lipoxygenases. Methionine would be present at this position instead of valine. Mutagenesis to introduce valine and reconstruction of the expression construct (m5LO/Met672Val) was carried out. In contrast to m5LO/Met672 expression in HEK 293 cells, m5LO/Met672Val exhibited high 5-lipoxygenase enzyme activity (measured as 5-H(P)ETE) with comparable immunoreactive protein levels (Fig. 2, A and B). No 5-lipoxygenase protein and enzyme activity were detected in mock-transfected cells. A 3′ RACE procedure starting with newly synthesized mouse macrophage cDNA and an alternate upstream primer (primer 7) verified the presence of a valine codon at position 672. The intracellular expression pattern of 5-lipoxygenase in paraformaldehyde-fixed, cytospun BMMC preparations was studied by indirect immunocytofluorescence labeling and confocal fluorescence imaging microscopy. In resting, unstimulated BMMC from wild-type mice 5-lipoxygenase was localized primarily within the nucleus (Fig. 3C). This was evident by the extensive co-localization with the nuclear stain Yo-Pro-1 (Fig. 3C) and Z-plane sectioning at 1-μm intervals followed by image reconstruction (not shown). No specific immunofluorescence signal was detected in BMMC from 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice or when the primary antiserum was substituted with non-immune serum (Fig. 3, A and B). If the divalent cation chelator EDTA was added to the modified Tyrode's buffer for the 30-min incubation period, there was a marked difference in the pattern of 5-lipoxygenase expression. Besides significant enzyme within the nucleus there was now clear evidence for 5-lipoxygenase throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3D). Washing the cells with, or without, divalent cations prior to the cell fixation step which took approximately 5-10 min did not appreciably alter this pattern (not shown). When BMMC were activated with IgE/antigen the 5-lipoxygenase “translocated” to a perinuclear location along the nuclear envelope but what appeared to be now mainly on the cytoplasmic side (Fig. 3E). In contrast, if the cells were stimulated with Ca2+ ionophore A23187 the immunofluorescence pattern was different. Signal was detected as a punctate/reticular pattern, possibly associated with structural proteins, both nuclear and perinuclear localized (Fig. 3F). Leukotriene synthesis was associated with IgE/antigen- and A23187-challenged, but not resting and EDTA-treated, BMMC obtained from wild-type mice (Fig. 4). All stimuli using BMMC obtained from 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice failed to produce detectable leukotriene products (Fig. 4).Figure 4:RP-HPLC detection of lipoxygenase products synthesized by IgE plus antigen-stimulated and calcium ionophore A23187 challenged BMMC cells. +/+, cells obtained from wild-type mouse; −/−, cells obtained from 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mouse. No detectable leukotrienes were synthesized by −/− cells (bottom panel), resting or EDTA-treated cells (not shown). The products eluting at 11.5 (peak I) and 24 (peak II) min co-elute with authentic LTB4 and LTC4 standards, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Recent data on the localization of 5-lipoxygenase in alveolar macrophages indicated the presence of enzyme in both membrane and soluble fractions, including nuclear localization in rat basophilic leukemia cells(7Coffey M.

This raised the possibility of the existence of distinct 5-lipoxygenase isoforms. Protein blot analysis indicated a single immunoreactive 5-lipoxygenase band in alveolar macrophages from normal wild-type mice but no band in 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice generated by gene targeting (Fig. 5A). Moreover, a product co-eluting with leukotriene C4 was synthesized by A23187-stimulated alveolar macrophages from wild-type mice but not 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice (not shown). We also examined the expression of genes involved in the production and regulation of leukotriene formation (FLAP and LTA hydrolase) at the protein level to see if there was a compensatory increase, or decrease, in expression in the absence of 5-lipoxygenase. Analysis of BMMC and macrophages from three separate mice using various amounts of protein indicated that leukotriene A4 hydrolase protein levels were not changed; however, FLAP levels dropped approximately 50% in 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice (Fig. 5B) as revealed by densitometric analysis. The 5-lipoxygenase chromosomal location (designated Alox5) was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived from matings of ((C57BL/6J × M. spretus)F1× C57BL/6J) mice. This interspecific backcross mapping panel has been typed for over 1700 loci that are well distributed among all the autosomes as well as the X chromosome(26Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Google Scholar). C57BL/6J and M. spretus DNAs were digested with several enzymes and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization for informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms using a mouse cDNA Alox5 probe. The 10.0-kb HindIII M. spretus fragment length polymorphisms (see “Experimental Procedures”) was used to follow the segregation of the Alox5 locus in backcross mice. The mapping results indicated that Alox5 is located in the central region of mouse chromosome 6 linked to mi, Raf1, and Ret. Although 134 mice were analyzed for every marker and are shown in the segregation analysis (Fig. 6), up to 175 mice were typed for some pairs of markers. Each locus was analyzed in pairwise combinations for recombination frequencies using the additional data. The ratios of the total number of mice exhibiting recombinant chromosomes to the total number of mice analyzed for each pair of loci, and the most likely gene orders are: centromere - mi − 15/175 - Raf1 − 0/138 - Alox5 − 1/151 - Ret. The recombination frequencies (expressed as genetic distances in centiMorgans (cM) ± the standard error) are - mi − 8.6 ± 2.1 - (Raf1, Alox5) − 0.7 ± 0.7 - Ret. No recombinants were detected between Raf1 and Alox5 in 138 animals typed in common suggesting that the two loci are within 2.1 cM of each other (upper 95% confidence limit). 5-Lipoxygenase exists as a single isoform in mice and traffics to various intracellular sites in activated BMMC. Using indirect immunocytofluorescence labeling combined with confocal fluorescence microscopy, 5-lipoxygenase was found almost exclusively within the nucleus of resting BMMC. A similar expression pattern was seen with the transformed RBL-1 rat basophilic leukemia-derived cell line. These basophilic cells bear some resemblance to mucosal mast cells since they secrete mast cell protease II(8Brock T.G. Paine R. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Google Scholar, 32Zheng Y.L. Chan B.M. Rector E.S. Berczi I. Froese A. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 194: 301-309Google Scholar). Interestingly, when resting BMMC were incubated in the absence of divalent cations (2 mM EDTA) for 30 min there was diffusion or leakage of 5-lipoxygenase from the nucleus throughout the cytoplasm. Enzyme also remained within the nucleus. The EDTA treatment probably caused a depletion of intracellular divalent cations, in addition to extracellular depletion, by disruption of ion pumps and transporter proteins. Although not proven, these results are suggestive of a primary or secondary divalent cation requirement to maintain nuclear 5-lipoxygenase localization. An intracellular Ca2+ change with ionophore stimulation resulted in a significant rearrangement of nuclear 5-lipoxygenase to a punctate/reticular pattern around the nuclear envelope. Given the recent data that 5-lipoxygenase can bind cytoskeletal proteins by SH3 domain interactions (9Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24163-24168Google Scholar) and previous data that 5-lipoxygenase undergoes a Ca2+-dependent translocation to membrane sites that requires extracellular Ca2+(3Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10980-10988Google Scholar, 33Wong A. Cook M.N. Foley J.J. Sarau H.M. Marshall P. Hwang S.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9346-9354Google Scholar) it is possible that 5-lipoxygenase is associating with nuclear filament proteins (lamins) or other cytoskeletal proteins that attach to the nuclear envelope through protein-protein interactions. More precise localization data should be achieved with high resolution electron microscopy. In fact, recent findings in human alveolar macrophages using this technique indicated 5-lipoxygenase association with the euchromatin in resting cells. A23187 stimulation resulted in translocation to the nuclear envelope(34Woods J.W. Coffey M.J. Brock T.G. Singer I.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2035-2046Google Scholar). Activation of BMMC by IgE/antigen, a challenge known to elicit transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ in these and rat basophilic leukemia cells(35Wong A. Cook M.N. Hwang S.M. Sarau H.M. Foley J.J. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4046-4053Google Scholar), also caused translocation of 5-lipoxygenase. The enzyme shifted predominantly to a juxtanuclear position with some localized distribution in the cytoplasm. Malaviya et al.(36Malaviya R. Malaviya R. Jakschik B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4939-4944Google Scholar) noticed a reversible translocation of 5-lipoxygenase in mast cells upon IgE/antigen stimulation from a supernatant to pellet fraction by Western blot analysis. The detection of membrane bound 5-lipoxygenase was dependent upon quick-freezing of the cells(36Malaviya R. Malaviya R. Jakschik B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4939-4944Google Scholar). How their results correlate with ours is uncertain due to the different means of analysis. Although many questions remain to be answered including: (i) what sequence-specific signals (e.g. nuclear localization signal) control trafficking of 5-lipoxygenase; (ii) what protein-protein interactions govern localization and movement; (iii) how Ca2+ ion or other divalent cation fluxes regulate 5-lipoxygenase compartmentalization; and (iv) how in vitro data obtained on fixed, immobilized cells correlate with in vivo cellular activation, it is becoming clear that the simple 5-lipoxygenase-initiated generation of leukotrienes and their subsequent extracellular transport will have to be modified with novel roles of 5-lipoxygenase within the nucleus. The murine 5-lipoxygenase cDNA was cloned by PCR based on homology with the human (12Matsumoto T. Funk C.D. Rdmark O. Hg J.-O. Jrnvall H. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85 (and correction p. 3406): 26-30Google Scholar, 13Dixon R.A.F. Jones R.E. Diehl R.E. Bennett C.D. Kargman S. Rouzer C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 416-420Google Scholar) and rat (14Balcarek J.M. Theisen T.W. Cook M.N. Varrichio A. Hwang S.-M. Strohsacker M.W. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13937-13941Google Scholar) sequences. All are the same size, taking into account a putative error noted at the deduced COOH terminus of the rat sequence(14Balcarek J.M. Theisen T.W. Cook M.N. Varrichio A. Hwang S.-M. Strohsacker M.W. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13937-13941Google Scholar, 37Minor W. Steczko J. Bolin J.T. Otwinowski Z. Axelrod B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6320-6323Google Scholar). The mouse sequence is 96% identical to the rat sequence and 93% identical to the human 5-lipoxygenase. It shares the conserved histidine and COOH-terminal isoleucine residues found in all lipoxygenases. Based on the crystal structure of the soybean 15-lipoxygenase, these residues act as ligands for the non-heme iron atom(37Minor W. Steczko J. Bolin J.T. Otwinowski Z. Axelrod B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6320-6323Google Scholar, 38Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Google Scholar). Serendipitously, a PCR-generated cloning error revealed the stringent requirements of the amino acid 2 residues upstream of the COOH-terminal isoleucine during expression experiments in HEK 293 cells. A conservative valine to methionine substitution abolished 5-lipoxygenase activity at position 672. This alteration would result in a small increased side chain volume in the vicinity of isoleucine 674, perhaps perturbing the ability of this residue to coordinate the iron atom. Previously, we carried out deletion of the COOH-terminal isoleucine and mutagenesis to 8 different residues using mouse 12-lipoxygenases and verified the essential importance of this residue for enzyme activity(39Chen X.-S. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Google Scholar). Only valine could be substituted for isoleucine with minimal loss of activity. Moreover, Zhang et al.(40Zhang Y. Rdmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 485-489Google Scholar) had found that deletion of 6 amino acids from the COOH terminus of human 5-lipoxygenase abolished enzyme activity. Taken together these results indicate the importance of the integrity of the 3 COOH-terminal amino acids of lipoxygenases which probably relates to the ability of the polypeptide chain to fold back and interact with the essential iron atom. 5-Lipoxygenase exists as a single form in the mouse unlike 12-lipoxygenase which has two distinct isoforms encoded by separate, linked genes(39Chen X.-S. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Google Scholar). First, we were unable to clone any cDNA variants indicative of splice variants. Second, disruption of the 5-lipoxygenase gene removed all 5-lipoxygenase protein and enzyme activity in alveolar macrophages (known to contain both soluble and membrane-bound species) and in IgE/antigen-activated BMMC (where nuclear and perinuclear expression patterns were seen). The polyclonal antibody used in these studies cross-reacts with human, rat(7Coffey M. Peters-Golden M. Fantone J.C. Sporn P.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 570-576Google Scholar, 8Brock T.G. Paine R. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Google Scholar), and mouse 5-lipoxygenases and would predictably detect alternative isoforms, if generated by different genes since 5-lipoxygenases display very high homology across species. Finally, our past data using Southern blot analysis with genomic DNA has indicated a single copy gene with no related cross-hybridizing bands at moderate stringency conditions in mice and humans(15Funk C.D. Hoshiko S. Matsumoto T. Rdmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2587-2591Google Scholar, 16Funk C.D. Kurre U. Griffis G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 714: 253-258Google Scholar). A single report describing human 5-lipoxygenase alternative transcripts (41Boado R.J. Pardridge W.M. Vinters H.V. Black K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9044-9048Google Scholar) could mean there is heterogeneity in the 3′- or 5′-untranslated regions, or possibly, that these transcripts were not entirely processed after transcription. Disruption of the 5-lipoxygenase gene in mice did not alter expression of leukotriene A4 hydrolase, an enzyme downstream in the pathway of leukotriene B4 synthesis, in macrophages and BMMC. However, FLAP expression was reduced about 50%. FLAP may act as an arachidonic acid transfer protein(6Abramovitz M. Wong E. Cox M.E. Richardson C.D. Li C. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 105-111Google Scholar). The reason, or mechanism, for the reduced FLAP expression is unknown. The human FLAP and 5-lipoxygenase genes reside on different chromosomes and have different promoter elements(15Funk C.D. Hoshiko S. Matsumoto T. Rdmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2587-2591Google Scholar, 42Kennedy B.P. Diehl R.E. Boie Y. Adam M. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8511-8516Google Scholar, 43Funk C.D. Funk L.B. FitzGerald G.A. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3962-3966Google Scholar). Perhaps, intracellular leukotrienes can act by a feedback mechanism to positively regulate FLAP gene expression, or inhibit degradation, and this pathway is abrogated in 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice. The 5-lipoxygenase gene maps to mouse chromosome 6 by interspecific backcross analysis. We have compared the interspecific map of chromosome 6 with a composite mouse linkage map that reports the map location of many uncloned mouse mutations (compiled by M. T. Davisson, T. H. Roderick, A. L. Hillyeard, and D. P. Doolittle and provided from GBASE, a computerized data base maintained at The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Alox5 mapped in a region of the composite map that lacks mouse mutations with a phenotype that might be expected for an alteration in this locus (data not shown). Consistent with this finding was the lack of an observable mutated phenotype in 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice under normal, non-stressed physiological conditions(17Chen X.-S. Sheller J.R. Johnson E. Funk C.D. Nature. 1994; 372: 179-181Google Scholar, 44Funk C.D. Chen X.-S. Kurre U. Griffis G. Adv. Prostaglandin, Thromboxane, Leukotriene Res. 1995; 23: 145-150Google Scholar). However, these mice exhibited blunted inflammatory responses in certain models of inflammation. The central region of mouse chromosome 6 shares regions of homology with human chromosomes 3 and 10 (summarized in Fig. 6). The human homolog of Alox5 has previously been assigned to human chromosome 10(43Funk C.D. Funk L.B. FitzGerald G.A. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3962-3966Google Scholar). The placement of the mouse gene in this region of mouse chromosome 6 confirms and extends this region of homology between mouse and human chromosomes. In conclusion, the murine 5-lipoxygenase has been characterized at several levels. A single 5-lipoxygenase form is distributed within the nucleus in mast cells and apparently traffics to different sites upon cellular activation. The availability of 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice should prove useful in the elucidation of putative nuclear functions.

Down-regulation of Id1 mRNA is associated with dimethyl sulfoxide-induced terminal differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells. To examine the significance of Id1 down-regulation in erythroid differentiation, we generated stable mouse erythroleukemia cell lines that constitutively express a “marked” form of the murine Id1 gene. Terminal erythroid differentiation was inhibited in these lines, as indicated by a block in activation of the erythroid-specific genes α-globin, β-globin, and band 3 and continued proliferation in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide. Interestingly, this block occurred even in the presence of normal levels of the lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1, NF-E2, and EKLF. Constitutive expression of Id1 did not interfere with DNase I hypersensitivity at site HS2 of the locus control region, expression of the erythropoietin receptor gene, or down-regulation of the endogenous Id1 or c-myc genes. The differentiation block is reversible in these lines and can be rescued by fusion with human erythroleukemia cells.

Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 378-382Google Scholar) has provided a useful model for the study of red blood cell differentiation and development. Treatment of MEL cells with chemical inducers such as dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) causes them to undergo a program of terminal differentiation similar to that of normal erythroid cells (23Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 378-382Google Scholar). A growing body of work highlights the role of transcriptional regulators in the differentiation process and in expression of the specialized phenotype of erythroid cells. At least three members of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) (45Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Google Scholar) family of transcription factors, TAL1 (65Visvader J. Begley C.G. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 187-194Google Scholar), Id1 (9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar), and Id2 (63Sun X.-H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Google Scholar), are regulated in erythroid cells in a pattern that implicates them in the control of red blood cell differentiation. TAL1 (formerly SCL, tal, TCL5; reviewed by 2Baer R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 341-347Google Scholar) is expressed in erythroid and related lineages and is up-regulated in MEL cells in response to Me2SO (65Visvader J. Begley C.G. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 187-194Google Scholar). Experiments in cultured erythroid cells (1Aplan P.D. Nakahara K. Orkin S.H. Kirsch I.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4073-4081Google Scholar; 24Green A. DeLuca E.

Nature. 1995; 373: 432-437Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the TAL1 protein is a positive regulator of erythroid differentiation and clearly establish an important role for bHLH proteins in erythropoiesis. murine erythroleukemia basic helix-loop-helix locus control region DNase I hypersensitive site erythroid Kruppel-like factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2 marked form of murine Id1 gene mutated version of Id1-er kilobase(s) murine sarcoma virus estrogen receptor. murine erythroleukemia basic helix-loop-helix locus control region DNase I hypersensitive site erythroid Kruppel-like factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2 marked form of murine Id1 gene mutated version of Id1-er kilobase(s) murine sarcoma virus estrogen receptor. Members of the bHLH family share a common amino acid sequence motif comprising a basic region just amino-terminal to an amphipathic α helix-intervening loop-amphipathic α helix (bHLH) (45Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Google Scholar). This motif has been shown to function in protein dimerization and DNA binding (reviewed by 35Kadesch T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 49-55Google Scholar and 66Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Google Scholar). The Id-like proteins lack the basic region but may still dimerize and thereby act as dominant negative regulators by inhibiting DNA binding (9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar). In this way, the Id proteins serve to modulate the activity of ubiquitous and cell type-specific bHLH proteins (discussed by 8Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lassar A. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Lockshon D. Weintraub H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 599: 1-11Google Scholar and 17Duncan M. DiCiccio-Bloom E.M. Xiang X. Benezra R. Chada K. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 1-10Google Scholar). The prototype Id gene, Id1, was originally cloned from a MEL cell cDNA library (9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar), although it is not erythroid-specific. Id1 has been functionally implicated in the differentiation of several cell types, including muscle (34Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Google Scholar), myeloid (38Kreider B.L. Benezra R. Rovera G. Kadesch T. Science. 1992; 255: 1700-1702Google Scholar), and B cells (52Pongubala J.M.R. Atchison M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1040-1047Google Scholar; 67Wilson R.B. Kiledjian M. Shen C.-P. Benezra R. Zwollo P. Dymecki S.M. Desiderio S.V. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6185-6191Google Scholar; 62Sun X.-H. Cell. 1994; 79: 893-900Google Scholar). During Me2SO-induced terminal MEL cell differentiation, the expression of Id1 (9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar) as well as Id2 (63Sun X.-H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Google Scholar) is down-regulated. These observations suggest that in a proliferating proerythroblast such as an uninduced MEL cell (23Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 378-382Google Scholar), Id inhibits the activation of the terminal differentiation program until the cell is exposed to an appropriate inducing signal (8Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lassar A. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Lockshon D. Weintraub H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 599: 1-11Google Scholar, 9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar). In this paper, we explore the functional significance of Id1 down-regulation in differentiating erythroid (MEL) cells. MEL cell lines that constitutively express functional Id1 protein fail to undergo terminal differentiation; both uninduced and induced levels of α-globin, β-globin, and band 3 transcription are markedly reduced, hemoglobin synthesis is greatly diminished, and the cells continue to proliferate in the presence of Me2SO. These results suggest that down-regulation of Id1 is required for terminal erythroid differentiation to proceed. The effect of unregulated expression of Id1 was not a promiscuous inhibition of erythroid gene expression, as transcription of several erythroid-specific genes (the erythropoietin receptor and the transcription factors GATA-1, NF-E2, and EKLF) was not affected. In contrast, a novel erythroid-enriched gene, JP19, was activated, raising the possibility that Id1 forms heterodimers not only with positive regulatory bHLH proteins but with repressors as well. Continued expression of Id1 had no effect on formation or stability of DNase I hypersensitive (HS) site HS2 within the β-globin locus control region (LCR) but inhibited formation of a Me2SO-inducible HS site within the promoter of the βmaj-globin gene. The Id1-mediated block to terminal differentiation occurred even in the presence of normal levels of three lineage-specific transcription factors (GATA-1, NF-E2, and EKLF) and was independent of c-myc. Furthermore, we observed that patterns of c-myc expression during terminal differentiation were unaffected by Id1 in these cells. Fusion of the constitutive Id1-expressing MEL cells with human erythroleukemia cells rescued mouse globin gene expression, probably by titrating the exogenous Id1 with positive regulatory factors; thus, the differentiation block is reversible. These findings support a model in which modulation of Id1 expression forms one component of the erythroid differentiation switch. The wild type Id1 coding sequence (9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar) was cloned in sense (S) and antisense (A) orientations into a derivative of EMSVscribe (14Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Google Scholar) containing a NotI linker inserted into the unique RI site to yield EMSV-Id(S)NotI and EMSV-Id(A)NotI. To generate a “marked” Id1 gene (Id1-er), we ligated a ~530-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment containing the entire Id1 coding sequence to a 0.95-kb estrogen receptor (ER) fragment, HE14 (18Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Google Scholar). The Id1 and ER coding sequences in this construct are out of frame by +1, and the first translational stop codon is found at the 22nd position downstream from the carboxyl-terminal residue of Id1, yielding a predicted Id1 protein product “marked” by the addition of a 21-amino acid peptide (Fig. 1). Because this peptide does not correspond to the native amino acid sequence of ER, the HE14 portion of the construct (er) is denoted using lower case letters. MEL cells (subline 585S) (5Baron M.H. Maniatis T. Cell. 1986; 46: 591-602Google Scholar) were coelectroporated (960 microfarads, 280 mV; Bio-Rad Gene Pulser) with a 20:1 ratio of KpnI-linearized EMSV-Id1-er (S/A) DNA and EcoRI-linearized pSV2neo. Drug selection was initiated after 24 h by addition of geneticin (G418, 0.8 mg/ml) to serially diluted cells in 48- or 96-well plates. Medium was changed every 2-3 days for 2-3 weeks, after which time the concentration of G418 was reduced to 0.4 mg/ml, and individual colonies were expanded. All mouse and human erythroleukemia cell lines were maintained and induced as previously described (5Baron M.H. Maniatis T. Cell. 1986; 46: 591-602Google Scholar). F4N and DS19/sc9 MEL cells were kindly provided by R. Benezra and P. Marks, respectively. In these sublines and in the 585S subline (see above) the level of Id1 RNA dropped sharply within 2 h after addition of Me2SO to the culture medium. Plasmids EMSV-Id1(S) and EMSV-Id1-er(S) were linearized with KpnI and used as templates for transcription with T3 RNA polymerase (Promega). In vitro translations of this RNA were performed in 25-μl reactions containing [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN) and 17.5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). Cells (2 × 107) were incubated for 7 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus methionine and cysteine, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1 mCi [35S]-Express Protein Labeling Mix (DuPont NEN, NEG-072). The cells were then harvested, and lysates were prepared as described (34Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Google Scholar). Incorporation of 35S was determined by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. 35S-Labeled lysates were precleared by overnight incubation with rabbit serum (1 μl/100 μl) and protein A-agarose (7 μl/100 μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4°C. Aliquots of cleared lysate were brought up to 125 μl with homogenization buffer (34Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Google Scholar). An equal volume of immunoprecipitation buffer (34Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Google Scholar) containing 2 μl of α-Id1 antiserum or preimmune serum was added, and the samples were rocked 6 h at 4°C. For competition experiments, the α-Id1 antiserum was preincubated with glutathione S-transferase-Id1 (34Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Google Scholar) or glutathione S-transferase leader protein (61Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar) at 1 μg/μl. Protein A-agarose beads (20 μl) were then added, and rocking was continued for 2 h. After centrifugation, immune complexes were washed three times with 0.8 ml of RIPA buffer (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), and 20 μl of dye buffer was added. Samples were electrophoresed on a 20% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize markers and then treated with Entensify enhancing agents (DuPont NEN) before drying for fluorography. Antisera and glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were generously provided by R. Benezra. Total cellular RNA was prepared as described (12Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar) and subjected to blotting analysis using standard procedures (55Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probe used to detect Id1 and Id1-er was the 0.9-kb BamHI-EcoRI insert from pMH18ΔR (9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar). A 2.1-kb EcoRI insert from pUCMα (5Baron M.H. Maniatis T. Cell. 1986; 46: 591-602Google Scholar) was used as a probe for mouse α-globin. A 0.74-kb KpnI-HindIII rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase insert from pBKSII+ GAPDH (a gift from T. Brown) was used as a loading control. Total cellular RNA prepared from induced and uninduced MEL cells was analyzed by quantitative RNase mapping as described (5Baron M.H. Maniatis T. Cell. 1986; 46: 591-602Google Scholar, 6Baron M.H. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1239-1247Google Scholar). The plasmid BSK-hER, containing a 253-base pair hER HindIII-BglII fragment (18Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Google Scholar), was linearized with HindIII and transcribed using T3 polymerase. RNase mapping yielded a protected fragment of 253 nucleotides. A riboprobe for hybridization with antisense RNA was prepared by T7 polymerase transcription from an XbaI-linearized BSK-hER template and yielded a protected fragment of 118 nucleotides. The templates for βmaj-, α-, and ϵ-globin and for γ-actin (6Baron M.H. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1239-1247Google Scholar) and mouse GATA-1 (4Baron M.H. Farrington S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3108-3114Google Scholar) have been described. A riboprobe for the erythroid cell-enriched gene JP19 was prepared by T3 polymerase transcription of HindIII-linearized template (JP19-215) and yielded a protected fragment of 215 nucleotides. The NF-E2 and EKLF templates were prepared by subcloning the products of polymerase chain reaction-amplified MEL cell cDNA into pBSK+. Both templates were linearized with XbaI and transcribed with T7 polymerase to yield protected hybridization products of 257 and 129 nucleotides, respectively. A probe against the mouse EpoR was prepared by BglII digestion of SP72EpoR (generously provided by B. Mathey-Prvot) and transcription with SP6 polymerase and protected an RNA fragment of 87 nucleotides. The mouse band 3 (37Kopito R.R. Andersson M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8035-8040Google Scholar) probe was prepared by T7 transcription from XbaI-linearized pRK145 (a kind gift from R. Kopito), and the c-myc probe was prepared by T7 transcription of HindIII-linearized pBSCPstI/XhoI/c-myc/exonI (kindly provided by K. Marcu). The c-myc probe hybridizes with transcripts initiating at each of two promoters, P1 and P2 (54Remmers E.F. Yang J.-Q. Marcu K.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 899-904Google Scholar), to yield a doublet band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nuclei isolated from uninduced and induced cells were treated with increasing amounts of DNase I, and genomic DNA was then purified (22Forrester W.C. Epner E. Driscoll M.C. Enver T. Brice M. Papayannopoulou T. Groudine M. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1637-1649Google Scholar). The DNA was digested with BamHI, fractionated on a 1% agarose gel, and blotted onto filters. Filters were probed with a 700-base pair BamHI-SspI fragment to examine HS2 of the LCR or with a 0.9-kb Pst fragment from the region immediately upstream of the βmaj-globin gene. Fusion of cells by treatment with polyethylene glycol was performed exactly as described (5Baron M.H. Maniatis T. Cell. 1986; 46: 591-602Google Scholar). To determine whether down-regulation of Id1 is required for terminal erythroid differentiation, we ectopically expressed the Id1 gene in MEL cells. A chimeric gene (termed Id1-er, Fig. 1A, see also “Experimental Procedures”) was constructed in which murine Id1 and hER coding sequences were shifted by +1 with respect to one another, yielding a predicted Id1 protein containing an additional 21 amino acids (Fig. 1B). As a control, a chimeric construct containing a mutated Id1 gene (PAH2-Id1; 49Pesce S. Benezra R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7874-7880Google Scholar) was prepared and denoted Id1PAH2-er. PAH2-Id1 contains a valine to proline substitution within the second amphipathic helix of the HLH domain. It cannot form heterodimers with the bHLH proteins E12 or E47 in vitro or inhibit MyoD-dependent transactivation in vivo (49Pesce S. Benezra R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7874-7880Google Scholar). Id1, Id1-er, and Id1PAH2-er proteins were translated in vitro and analyzed for their activity in DNA binding (electrophoretic mobility shift) assays. Both Id-1 and Id1-er inhibited DNA binding by a truncated version of the bHLH protein E47 (46Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Google Scholar) in a dosependent manner, while Id1PAH2-er had no effect (not shown). Therefore, inhibition of DNA binding by Id1 or Id1-er requires a functional dimerization surface (mutated in Id1PAH2-er), and Id1-er, like Id1, inhibits DNA binding directly through formation of inactive heterodimers with other bHLH proteins. Id1-er and Id1PAH2-er were subcloned into the expression vector EMSVscribe (here abbreviated EMSV) (14Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Google Scholar) in the sense (S) and antisense (A) orientations. To confirm that addition of the 21 amino acid peptide did not adversely affect Id1 activity, the chimeric Id1-er constructs were tested for their ability to inhibit MyoD-dependent transactivation when transfected into cultured cells (9Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar; 49Pesce S. Benezra R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7874-7880Google Scholar). As anticipated, expression of Id1 or Id1-er completely inhibited activation of an MCK-CAT reporter (49Pesce S. Benezra R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7874-7880Google Scholar) by MyoD, in the sense (S) but not the antisense (A) orientation (not shown). Id1PAH2-er had no effect in either orientation, consistent with earlier findings (49Pesce S. Benezra R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7874-7880Google Scholar) and indicating that 1) the activity of Id1-er is dependent upon its ability to dimerize with other bHLH proteins and 2) the inhibitory effect of Id1-er(S) was not related to the addition of the 21-amino acid peptide. The chimeric Id1 genes were introduced into MEL cells and G418r clones were isolated. Four independent Id1-er(S)expressing lines (B5, A7, A5, Fig. 2A; and A1, not shown) and one Id1-er(A)-expressing line (B7, Fig. 3) were obtained. To estimate the relative levels of Id1-er and Id1 RNA in the cell lines, total RNA was prepared and examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Id1-er RNA (~1.5 kb) was detected in lines B5 (Fig. 2A, lanes 6-10), A7 (lanes 11-15), A5 (lanes 16-20), and A1 (not shown) but not in the parental MEL line (lanes 1-5). The ratio of exogenous Id1-er to endogenous Id1 RNA (~0.9 kb) was ~10:1 in two of the lines (B5 and A7; Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 11) and ~2:1 in the other two lines (A5, lane 16; and A1, not shown). Id1-er RNA levels decreased transiently during treatment with Me2SO, though they were always higher than endogenous Id1 levels (Fig. 2A). Significantly, the endogenous Id1 gene was down-regulated in parental MEL cells and in the Id1-er-expressing lines with similar kinetics (Fig. 2A and other data not shown), suggesting that, at least in erythroid cells, endogenous Id1 gene expression is not positively or negatively autoregulated. The rapid decrease in endogenous Id1 expression (within 2 h after addition of Me2SO to the culture medium) has also been seen in other systems (38Kreider B.L. Benezra R. Rovera G. Kadesch T. Science. 1992; 255: 1700-1702Google Scholar) and was also observed with two other MEL cell sublines (data not shown). In some experiments, the decrease was transient and was followed by a later and variable rise in Id1 RNA levels (within 10-24 h).Figure 3:Expression of erythroid-specific genes in Id1-erexpressing and -non-expressing MEL cell lines. MEL cell lines were cultured for 4 days in the absence (odd-numbered lanes) or in the presence (even-numbered lanes) of Me2SO. Total cellular RNA was prepared and analyzed by RNase protection using probes for mouse β-globin, band 3, γ-actin, JP19, and EpoR. MEL lines B3, C6, D2, and B7 were negative for Id1-er and expressed levels of βmaj-globin and band 3 RNA comparable to those found in the parental MEL cells. A reciprocal relationship was observed for β-globin and JP19 RNA levels in Id1-er+ and Id1-er- lines (compare JP19, lanes 5-12, with βmaj in A, lanes 7-14). The lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 and the erythropoietin receptor were expressed at similar levels in all lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Northern blot analysis of RNA samples from the experiment of Fig. 2A indicated that the α-globin gene was strongly induced by Me2SO treatment of the parental MEL cell line (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-5) but that this activation was blocked in Me2SO-treated Id1-er-expressing lines (shown for line B5 in Fig. 2B, lanes 6-10; also, see below). As a first step in correlating this phenotype with Id1-er translation, we assayed for the presence of Id1-er protein in metabolically labeled MEL cell extracts. 35S-Labeled cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Id1 antiserum, without competitor protein (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 4) or with antiserum first incubated with unlabeled, purified glutathione S-transferase-Id1 fusion protein (lanes 2 and 5) or glutathione S-transferase leader protein alone (lanes 3 and 6). Id1-er protein was specifically detected in the Id1-er-expressing line B5 (lanes 4 and 6) but not in the nonexpressing control line C6 (lanes 1 and 3). Similar results were obtained for line A7, in which Id1-er RNA levels were comparable to those of B5. For both control MEL cells and all four Id1-er-expressing lines, endogenous Id1 protein was only very weakly detectable and does not show up well in the photograph. Levels of Id1-er protein in lines A5 and A1 were also very low and were comparable to or slightly higher than the levels of endogenous Id1 in undifferentiated MEL cells (not shown). Thus, the levels of protein expressed from the transfected genes mirrored the RNA levels found in the four cell lines. We next examined the consequences of deregulated Id1 transcription on the expression of a variety of genes using an RNase protection assay (Fig. 3). The basal (uninduced) level of expression of βmaj-globin in each of the Id1-er-expressing lines (top panel, lanes 7, 9, 11, 13) was significantly lower than that in the control (non-expressing) lines (lanes 1, 3, 5) or in an antisense line (lane 15). While the Id1-er(S)-non-expressing lines showed a robust activation of βmaj-globin transcription in response to Me2SO (lanes 2, 4, 6, 16), the induced levels in the Id1-er(S)-expressing lines (lanes 8, 10, 12, 14) remained at or below the levels seen in the uninduced controls (compare lanes 8, 10, 12, 14 with lanes 1, 3, 5, 15). Essentially identical results were obtained for α-globin (Fig. 2B and other data not shown). This block to globin gene expression was observed in the lines that expressed Id1-er at low levels (A1 and A5) as well as in the lines that expressed Id1-er at higher levels (B5 and A7), suggesting that relatively small perturbations in Id1 expression may suffice to inhibit erythroid differentiation (see “Discussion”). In a similar fashion, the levels of the erythroid gene band 3 were markedly reduced in both the uninduced and Me2SO-induced state in all four Id1-er(S)-expressing lines (Fig. 3). Because Id1 is normally expressed in uninduced, cycling MEL cells, we considered the possibility that artificially raising Id1 levels might have caused a de-differentiation, which would preclude erythroid-specific gene expression. To address this question, we examined the expression of other genes, including transcription factors known to regulate the activity of erythroid-specific enhancers and/or promoters. Transcription of JP19, a novel erythroid-enriched gene,2 2J. Lister and M. H. Baron, unpublished observations. was strongly activated in Id1-er(S)-expressing lines (Fig. 3, lanes 7-14) compared with control lines C6 and D2 (lanes 3-6). In contrast, mRNA levels for the erythropoietin receptor (68Youssoufian H. Zon L.I. Orkin S.H. D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3675-3682Google Scholar) and the lineage-restricted transcription factors GATA-1, NF-E2, and EKLF (see below) were identical in Id1-er-expressing and control lines and showed little or no change upon Me2SO induction. These observations are consistent with the notion that Id1 prevents uninduced MEL cells from initiating their pathway of differentiation. An alternative explanation for the absence of α- and β-globin gene expression is that spontaneous nondifferentiating variants were isolated during the derivation of these lines. To ensure that we were not misled by clonal variations, we analyzed a total of 23 independently isolated control lines and found that all of these control lines differentiated in the presence of Me2SO; in no instance was a clone encountered where globin expression was less than ~75% of the level of the C6 control line, and in some cases it was greater (not shown). In contrast, the maximum levels of globin expression observed for the four Id1-er-expressing cell lines (Fig. 3A, lanes 8, 10, 12, and 14) were 0.5-2% of the C6 control (determined by RNase protection of serially diluted samples). As expected, expression of the mutated Id1-er gene (Id1PAH2-er) had no effect on erythroid differentiation (not shown). We therefore conclude that the observed inhibition of terminal differentiation is likely to be due to the continued production of Id1-er in lines B5, A7, A5, and A1 and is not the result of spontaneous events unrelated to Id1 expression. Moreover, the lack of inhibition by antisense or mutated Id-er indicates that inhibition by Id1-er is mediated by protein and requires a functional dimerization surface. Interestingly, the Id1-er-expressing lines were able to proliferate continuously when grown in medium containing Me2SO, while the growth rate of control cultures slowed down considerably, and significant cell death was observed within 6-7 days (not shown). Proliferation was in fact enhanced by constitutive Id1 expression; the"

The sites of α1-β subunit interaction have been localized recently to cytoplasmic domains of both subunits. The α1 subunit interaction domain (AID) is an 18-amino-acid conserved motif located between repeats I and II on all α1 subunits which is essential for the binding of β subunits. In order to further study the interaction of β subunits with AID, we have expressed a 50-amino-acid glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein from the α1A subunit that contains the AID. Mutant GST fusion proteins that contain a single amino acid change (Y392S, Y392F, and Y392W) in the AIDA along with control GST were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads to form affinity beads. Binding assays using these affinity beads with in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled β2 and β3 subunits demonstrate that the hydroxyl group on tyrosine 392 of AIDA is critical for binding to β subunits. The affinity bead assay was also used to identify and characterize native β subunits from detergent extracts of different tissues. The AIDA affinity beads, but not the control or Y392S beads, specifically bind β subunits from detergent extracts of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain. Immunoblot analyses demonstrate the presence of β1a in skeletal muscle, β2 and β3 in cardiac muscle, and β1b, β3, and β4 in brain. The assays also demonstrate the AIDA beads bind to β subunits from tissue homogenates extracted with low salt and no detergent suggesting the existence of a pool of β subunits which is not always associated with α1 subunits. Also, β subunits from solubilized skeletal muscle triads can be affinity-purified using AIDA CNBr-Sepharose. Our data demonstrate that the AID binds to native β subunits from detergent and non-detergent tissue extracts illustrating that this domain on the α1 subunit is the major anchoring site for the β subunit. β Subunits of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels play an important role in regulating Ca2+ channel function.

Voltage-dependent calcium channels play a critical role in the regulation of many cellular processes. A number of classes (T-, L-, N-, and P-type) of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels have been identified and distinguished on the bases of their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties(1Fox A.P. Nowycky M.C. Tsien R.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 394: 149-172Google Scholar, 2Fox A.P. Nowycky M.C. Tsien R.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 394: 173-200Google Scholar, 3Miller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1403-1406Google Scholar). The L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel is involved in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal and cardiac muscle while the T-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel has been shown to be involved in pacemaker activity. The N-type (ω-conotoxin GVIA receptor) and P-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels are found in both central and peripheral neurons and play an essential role in controlling neurotransmitter release from these neurons(4Smith S.J. Augustine G.J. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 458-464Google Scholar). In addition to the regulation of transmitter release, the N-type Ca2+ channel also helps direct the migration of immature neurons(5Komuro H. Rakic P. Science. 1992; 257: 806-809Google Scholar). Both the skeletal muscle L-type and the neuronal N-type Ca2+ channels have been purified, and each of these Ca2+ channels contain common subunits (α1, α2δ, and β) and one variable subunit (γ and 95-kDa) (6Leung A.T. Imagawa T. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7943-7946Google Scholar, 7Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Sakamoto J. Franzini-Armstrong C. Pragnell M. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. Science. 1993; 261: 486-489Google Scholar). The β1a and β3 subunits have been shown to associate with the purified dihydropyridine receptor and ω-conotoxin GVIA receptor, respectively. Biochemical studies have also demonstrated that the β subunit is tightly associated with the α1 subunit in Ca2+ channel complexes. Sequence analysis of β subunits have illustrated a lack of transmembrane segments in these proteins which suggest that these subunits are entirely cytoplasmic. β Subunits are also substrates for numerous protein kinases (8Jahn H. Nastainczyk W. Rohrkasten A Schneider T. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 535-542Google Scholar) and are thus regulated by intracellular signaling. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel subunits have now been divided into several classes based on their molecular properties. The pore-forming subunit, α1, has been separated into six classes, S, A, B, C, D, and E, while the β subunit has been separated into four classes; β1, β2, β3, and β4(9Birnbaumer L. Campbell K.P. Catteral W.A. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Horne W.A. Mori Y. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 503-506Google Scholar). Also, other alternatively spliced products from these genes have been identified(10Perez-Reyes E. Wei X. Castellano A. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20430-20436Google Scholar, 11Powers P.A.

So far, only one single gene seems to encode the α2δ subunit. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated the importance of both the α2 and β subunits on the functional expression of α1 subunits (13Lacerda A.E. Kim H.S. Ruth P. Perez-Reyes E. Flockerzi V.

These subunits regulate the expression of the α1 subunit by inducing a conformational change in the structure of the α1 subunit and/or by targeting the Ca2+ channel to the membrane(18Neely A. Wei X. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Science. 1993; 262: 575-578Google Scholar, 19Nishimura S. Takeshima H. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 283-286Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the β subunit of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels binds to a cytoplasmic sequence that is located between the first and second hydrophobic repeats of all α1 subunits(16Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Google Scholar). This site has been named the alpha 1 subunit interaction domain or AID1 1The abbreviations used are: AIDα1 subunit interaction domainBIDβ subunit interaction domainGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salineCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: AIDα1 subunit interaction domainBIDβ subunit interaction domainGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salineCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.(20De Waard M.

The corresponding interaction site on the β subunit has also been identified(17De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Google Scholar). This site, a 30-amino-acid N-terminal region of the second conserved domain of the β subunit, has been named the beta subunit interaction domain or BID. The sequence of the BID is also very conserved between the different β subunit isoforms. It has been demonstrated by several point mutations of conserved amino acids in both epitopes that the AID and BID are required for the binding of β subunits and also the changes in activation kinetics, voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and the increase in peak currents. Since both the AID and BID are necessary for the α1-β subunit interaction, an affinity bead assay has been developed to probe this subunit-subunit interaction(20De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H.Y. Campbell K.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): A13Google Scholar). The results reported here further characterize the molecular interaction between the α1 subunit and β subunit. We also demonstrate that native β subunits from various tissue extracts can be identified and purified with the use of AID affinity beads. α1 subunit interaction domain β subunit interaction domain glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. α1 subunit interaction domain β subunit interaction domain glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. The TNT™-coupled reticulocyte lysate system was purchased from Promega. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside is from Life Technologies, Inc., reduced glutathione from U. S. Biochemical Corp., [35S]methionine from Amersham, and glutathione-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose from Pharmacia Biotech. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Triads from rabbit skeletal muscle were purified as described previously(21Sharp A.H. Imagawa T. Leung A.T. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12309-12315Google Scholar). Proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE (3-12% gradient gels) used the buffer system of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis as described previously(23Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Campbell K.P. Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 1127-1139Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled β subunits were synthesized using the TNT™ system. Two cDNA clones were used: β2a (GenBank™ accession number X64297) and β3 (M88751). The concentrations of the β subunits were determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by scintillation counting. Polyclonal antibodies against specific peptides to β1a, β1b, β2, β3, and β4 were produced as described previously(24McPherson P.S. Kim Y.K. Valdivia H. Knudson C.M. Takekura H. Franzini-Armstrong C. Coronado R. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 17-25Google Scholar). Specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Rabbit 62) were produced against a 15-amino-acid peptide (DLEEDEAELGEQSGS) of the insert region of the β1a subunit(25Ruth P. Rohrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E. Regulla S. Meyer H.M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Science. 1989; 245: 1115-1118Google Scholar), and polyclonal antibodies (Rabbit 63) were generated against the C-terminal 15-amino-acid peptide (NKNELEGWGQGVYIR) of the β1b subunit(26Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 253-258Google Scholar). Specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Rabbits 86 and 87) were produced against the C-terminal 15-amino-acid peptide (RSEAGEWNRDVYIRQ) of the β2 subunit(27Hullin R. Singer-Lahat D. Freichel M. Biel M. Dascal N. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 885-890Google Scholar, 28Perex-Reyes E. Castellano A. Kim S.H. Bertrand P. Baggstrom E. Lacerda A.E. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1792-1797Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Rabbit 95) were generated against the C-terminal 15-amino-acid peptide (DRNWQRNRPWPKDSY) of the β3 subunit (27Hullin R. Singer-Lahat D. Freichel M. Biel M. Dascal N. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 885-890Google Scholar, 29Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3450-3455Google Scholar), and polyclonal antibodies (Rabbit 127) were produced against the C-terminal amino acid peptide (RGSPGGCSHDSRHRL) of the β4 subunit(30Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12359-12366Google Scholar). All of the rabbit polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified from Immobilon-P transfer strips of each 15-amino-acid peptide conjugated to bovine serum albumin as described previously(31Witcher D.R. McPherson P. Kahl S.D. Lewis T. Bentley P. Mullinnix M. Windass J.D. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13076-13079Google Scholar). Also, β1a and α1s polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified from Guinea Pig 48 (GP 48) (32Sharp A.H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2816-2825Google Scholar) using Immobilon-P transfer strips of the β1a and α1s subunits of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor, respectively. Biotinylated affinity-purified antibodies were used in the Western blots of cardiac tissue. The biotinylation of affinity-purified antibodies were performed according to standard protocol (Amersham). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the GST fusion protein containing the AIDA using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis system (Clontech) as described previously(16Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Google Scholar). The following primers were used to generate the mutant GST fusion proteins: 5’-CGAGCTCAACGGGTCCATGGAGTGGATCTCAAAAGC-3’ (Y392S), 5’-CGAGCTCAACGGGTTCATCGAGTGGATCTCAAAAGC-3’ (Y392F), and 5’-CGAGCTCAACGGGTGGATGGAGTGGATCTCAAAAGC3’ (Y392W). The mutations were verified by sequence analysis. Large bacteria cultures (300 ml) containing the pGEX plasmids (33Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar) encoding for control and AIDA fusion proteins (wild-type and mutant sequences containing the α1A subunit motif that binds the β subunits) (16Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Google Scholar) were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells. Overnight cultures were grown and induced according to standard procedures(23Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Campbell K.P. Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 1127-1139Google Scholar). The cell cultures were spun down and resuspended in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and sonicated twice for 15 s. The sonicated material was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min in a Beckman JA-17 rotor. The supernatant of the control GST fusion protein was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed extensively with PBS, and the fusion proteins were then eluted with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) containing 10 mM glutathione. The procedure was more complex for the wild-type and mutant AIDA GST fusion proteins since >90% of these fusion proteins were insoluble in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. For these GST fusion proteins, the pellets from the first centrifugation were resuspended in 10 ml of PBS containing 1% Sarcosyl (Sigma). After incubation for 30 min at 4°C, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation as described above. Triton X-100 was added to the supernatants to a final concentration of 2% and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4°C. Again, the glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed extensively with PBS, and the fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mM glutathione in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. GST, AIDA GST fusion protein, and mutant AIDA GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified using glutathione-Sepharose as described above. To prepare the tissue homogenates used in the association assay, rabbit skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain tissues were homogenized in a blender (Osterizer Cycle) in a 1:5 ratio (w/v) in the homogenization buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 M NaCl, 1% CHAPS, and several protease inhibitors: aprotinin (76.8 nM), benzamidine (0.83 mM), leupeptin (1.1 μM), pepstatin A (0.7 μM), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.23 mM) three times for 30 s. The tissue homogenates were incubated for 2 h at 4°C and then centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 35 min in a 45 Ti rotor at 4°C. The supernatants were removed and diluted 1 to 10 in a dilution buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) with protease inhibitors as described above. The diluted supernatants were then incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 35 min in a 45 Ti rotor at 4°C to remove any precipitated material. The solubilized homogenates were subsequently incubated with the GST fusion proteins conjugated to Sepharose beads overnight. After the incubation, the Sepharose beads were washed extensively with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, and protease inhibitors. Proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Similar experiments were also performed by homogenizing rabbit skeletal and brain tissues with a buffer that contained 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, protease inhibitors, and no detergent. These homogenates were also incubated with GST, wild-type AIDA GST, or mutant AIDA GST fusion proteins conjugated to Sepharose beads overnight, washed extensively, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Purified GST, AIDA GST fusion protein, and mutant AIDA GST fusion protein were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads in 100 mM NaHCO3 (pH 8.3), 500 mM NaCl for 3 h at room temperature and at a protein concentration of approximately 0.5 mg/ml resin. Each resin was washed four times with PBS, and the remaining active groups on the beads were blocked with 200 mM glycine (pH 8.0) for 3 h at room temperature. The resin was stored at 4°C in PBS and 0.001% sodium azide. 50 mg of skeletal muscle triads were solubilized at a protein concentration of 4 mg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 M NaCl, and 1% CHAPS for 1 h at 4°C. The mixture was spun at 35,000 rpm for 35 min in a 45 Ti rotor at 4°C. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and was circulated over a 5-ml AIDA-Sepharose column for 6 h at 4°C. The column was washed extensively with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% CHAPS, and the skeletal muscle β subunit was eluted from the AIDA-Sepharose column with 2-ml fractions of buffer containing 50 mM glycine (pH 2.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% CHAPS. The fractions were neutralized immediately with 1 M MOPS (pH 7.6). To examine the specific interaction between the α1 and β subunits, we have developed an in vitro binding assay(20De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H.Y. Campbell K.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): A13Google Scholar). In this affinity assay, the AIDA was expressed as a 50-amino-acid GST fusion protein and used as a ligand for in vitro translated and native β subunits. To characterize the interaction of the AIDA with different β subunits, we examined the ability of several AID GST fusion proteins, each containing point mutations at tyrosine 392, to bind to different β subunits (Fig. 1A). Tyrosine 392 is one of several residues previously shown to be important for the α1-β subunit interaction. These three mutant GST fusion proteins, AIDY392S, AIDY392F, and AIDY392W, along with GST were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads to form affinity beads. Both in vitro translated 35S-labeled β2 and β3 subunits were used as the substrate for the affinity binding assay (Fig. 1B). The results of the binding assay show that, compared to the wild-type AIDA GST fusion protein, the binding of the three mutant AIDA fusion proteins to both 35S-labeled β2 and β3 were dramatically reduced. Similar to what was seen with an overlay assay with 35S-labeled β1b(16Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Google Scholar), a 250 nM concentration of the mutant AIDY392S bound less than 5% of both 35S-labeled β2 and β3 subunits. Consistent with the idea that this tyrosine is critical for the α1-β interaction, the affinity beads containing a 250 nM concentration of the mutant AIDY392W bound only 9% and 6% of the 35S-labeled β2 and β3 subunits, respectively. Also, affinity beads containing a 250 nM concentration of the mutant AIDY392F bound 20% and 30% of the 35S-labeled β2 and β3 subunits, respectively. These results demonstrate that the mutations in tyrosine 392 had a profound effect on the ability of both 35S-labeled β2 and β3 to bind to the mutant AIDA affinity beads. Furthermore, the dramatic decrease in the affinity between the β subunit and the mutant AIDY392F affinity beads suggests that the hydroxyl group in tyrosine 392 plays an important role in the molecular interaction between the α1 and β subunits in voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. In order to investigate the ability of β subunits from solubilized skeletal muscle triads to bind the AID, this epitope was expressed as a 50-amino-acid GST fusion protein. The AIDA GST fusion protein was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads and used as the substrate for the binding of native β subunits in solubilized skeletal muscle triads. A mutant GST fusion protein, AIDY392S, which contains a single amino acid change in the AIDA, and GST were also produced and coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads to form affinity beads. The interaction between the mutant, AIDY392S, and the β subunit was shown to be greatly reduced using an overlay assay or in expression studies with Xenopus oocytes(16Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated the specificity of the AIDA bead assay with in vitro translated 35S-labeled β subunits(20De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H.Y. Campbell K.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): A13Google Scholar). Fig. 2 illustrates that AIDA-Sepharose beads are capable of binding β subunits from solubilized skeletal muscle triads. Immunoblot analysis with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against the α1S subunit of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor from GP 48 (32Sharp A.H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2816-2825Google Scholar) revealed that the α1 subunit was present only in solubilized skeletal muscle triads and void of the AIDA bead assay but not present with the AIDA-Sepharose affinity beads (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the AIDA-Sepharose beads bind only to β subunits that are not associated with α1S in native tissues confirming the role of AID as the primary β anchoring site. Immunoblot analysis with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against the β1a subunit from GP 48 also showed that the AIDA-Sepharose beads were able to bind the β1a subunit from the solubilized skeletal muscle preparation. The affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies identified a doublet at a molecular mass of 52 kDa and a minor band at 71 kDa. Alkaline phosphatase treatment of the β1a subunit bound to the AIDA-Sepharose beads demonstrated that the upper band of the doublet was a phosphorylated form of the β1a subunit (data not shown). The minor band at a molecular mass of 71 kDa was identified by two other β1a-specific polyclonal antibodies, but not affinity-purified β1b antibodies on immunoblots, suggesting that this protein is a splice variant of the β1 gene. It is also possible that this protein is an alternatively spliced form of another known or unidentified β subunit. This protein is not detected in the purified skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor which suggests that this β subunit may associate with a different α1 subunit present in skeletal muscle or a peripheral nerve contaminant in our skeletal muscle preparation. Both GST and the mutant AIDY392S-Sepharose beads did not bind any β subunits (Fig. 2B). It has been shown that the AID site anchors the β subunit to the α1 subunit(16Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Google Scholar, 17De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Google Scholar). Recent experimental evidence suggests the existence of other sites of interaction between the β subunit and the α1 subunit(34Olcese R. Qin N. Schneider T. Neely A. Wei X. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1433-1438Google Scholar). Our results show that when native β subunits are associated with the AID no α1S subunits can bind to the AIDA-β subunit complex. This demonstrates that when the primary AID-BID sites are occupied, α1 subunits cannot bind with high affinity to sites other than the BID on β subunits. Thus, our data strongly support the idea that the interaction site identified by Pragnell et al.(16Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Google Scholar) and De Waard et al.(17De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Google Scholar) are the only major high affinity sites that anchor the β subunit to the α1 subunit and that other potential interaction sites in β subunits are low affinity and more labile. Affinity bead assays were also performed on detergent-solubilized skeletal muscle homogenates. SDS-PAGE of the proteins bound to the affinity beads illustrates that the glutathione-Sepharose beads contained equal amounts of GST, AIDA, and AIDY392S fusion proteins (Fig. 3A). The AIDA-Sepharose beads, but not the GST or mutant AIDY392S-Sepharose beads, specifically bound β1a subunit from the skeletal muscle extract. The β1a subunit was detected by Western blot analysis using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies from Rabbit 62 (Fig. 3B). These polyclonal antibodies were directed against the insert region of the β1a subunit. The arrow in Fig. 3 denotes the location of the β1a subunit on the Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel and immunoblot. The β1a subunit present in the crude homogenate and void was almost undetectable by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B) demonstrating the enrichment of the β1a subunit with the AIDA-Sepharose affinity beads. Again, the affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies identified a splice variant of a β subunit which migrated at the molecular mass of 71 kDa. The 71-kDa β1 subunit was only detectable with the AIDA-Sepharose affinity beads and not in the skeletal muscle homogenate. Polyclonal antibodies against other β subunit isoforms (β2, β3, and β4) did not detect the presence of these isoforms on similar immunoblots. These immunoblot results parallel the results of Northern blot analysis which have shown only the β1a transcript present in skeletal muscle(25Ruth P. Rohrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E. Regulla S. Meyer H.M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Science. 1989; 245: 1115-1118Google Scholar). With the use of the affinity bead assay, the identity of β subunits present in CHAPS detergent cardiac muscle extract which bound to the AIDA-Sepharose beads was determined. Fig. 4A illustrates that the glutathione-Sepharose beads contained equal amounts of GST, AIDA, and AIDY392S fusion proteins when analyzed on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Immunoblot analysis of nitrocellulose blots transferred from similar polyacrylamide gels and stained with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to other β subunit isoforms (β1a, β1bβ2, β3, and β4) demonstrated that both β2 and β3 were present in cardiac tissue and bound to the AIDA-Sepharose beads (Fig. 4B, arrows). Immunoblot analysis did not detect β1 or β4 subunits using this affinity bead assay suggesting that these β subunits are not expressed in heart. Our data are in accordance with Northern blot analysis that shows the expression of both β2 and β3 subunit mRNAs in cardiac muscle(27Hullin R. Singer-Lahat D. Freichel M. Biel M. Dascal N. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 885-890Google Scholar, 28Perex-Reyes E. Castellano A. Kim S.H. Bertrand P. Baggstrom E. Lacerda A.E. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1792-1797Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that both the β2 and β3 subunits are present at the protein level in cardiac tissue and are consistent with the idea that β2 could be associated with the α1C subunit in cardiac muscle. Whether the β3 subunit is also associated with the α1C or some other α1 subunit isoform in cardiac muscle remains to be investigated. Fig. 5 illustrates the results of the AIDA affinity bead assay from whole brain extracts. The glutathione beads used in the assay contained approximately equivalent amounts of GST, AIDA GST fusion protein, and the mutant AIDY392S GST fusion protein as demonstrated by the Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows that C-terminal affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies from Rabbit 95 and Rabbit 127 identified β3 and β4, respectively, on immunoblot analysis of the AIDA-Sepharose affinity beads. Again, GST and AIDY392S-Sepharose beads did not bind detectable amounts of β subunits from the extracts. Both β1b and β2 could not be detected by immunoblot analysis using this procedure. Although both transcripts have been shown to be present in brain(26Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 253-258Google Scholar, 27Hullin R. Singer-Lahat D. Freichel M. Biel M. Dascal N. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 885-890Google Scholar, 28Perex-Reyes E. Castellano A. Kim S.H. Bertrand P. Baggstrom E. Lacerda A.E. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1792-1797Google Scholar), the level of protein expression of these two β subunits may have made these subunits difficult to detect with this affinity bead assay. Also, the differences seen between the Northern blot analysis and the level of protein detected by this method could be due to spatial and/or temporal differences in β subunit expression. In order to determine the protein expression of the four β subunit isoforms in different regions of the rabbit brain, AIDA-Sepharose bead assays were performed on tissue extracts from the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and brain stem. The same amount of tissue (2.5 g) from each brain region was homogenized with the extraction buffer containing detergent. With the use of C-terminal affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies from Rabbit 63, immunoblot analysis revealed that β1b (83 kDa) was present in both the hippocampus and cortex extracts, very weakly in cerebellum, but absent or undetectable in the basal ganglia and brain stem (Fig. 6). The protein expression level was higher in the hippocampus than in the cortex for the β1b subunit. The levels of protein expression of this β subunit parallel exactly the level of the mRNA for this β subunit on Northern blot analysis(26Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 253-258Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of the AIDA-Sepharose bead from whole brain extracts did not detect the β1b subunit (Fig. 5). This suggests that in whole brain extracts the β1b subunit is below the detection limit for the affinity bead assay. Immunoblot analysis of the β subunits bound to the AIDA-Sepharose affinity beads from different brain regions also demonstrated that both β3 and β4 subunits were expressed in all brain regions. The β3 subunit appeared to be expressed at a higher level throughout the brain compared to both β1b and β4 subunits. Although C-terminal affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against β2 were also used on a similar immunoblot, no staining was detected in any of the different brain regions. This suggests that the β2 subunit is either absent or at levels that are below detection using this assay throughout the rabbit brain. To determine the existence of β subunits that were not assembled into voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel complexes, AIDA-Sepharose bead assay was performed with tissue homogenates which were extracted using a low salt buffer (100 mM NaCl) and no detergent. As we have demonstrated in the previous experiments, the AIDA in the α1 subunit is capable of binding native β subunits from skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain. However, the buffer used to extract the different tissues contained high salt and CHAPS. While the disassociation of in vitro translated 35S-labeled β subunits bound to the AIDA GST fusion protein could be partially induced (10%) by these extraction conditions, even milder conditions, low salt and no detergent, were used in the present tissue extractions. Fig. 7A illustrates that the AIDA-Sepharose affinity beads bound to native nonassociated β1a subunits that were present in this skeletal muscle extract using immunoblot analysis with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies from Rabbit 62. The AIDA-Sepharose beads also bound the β3 subunit (58 kDa) from low salt brain extracts (Fig. 7B). Again, demonstrating the specificity of the bead assay, both GST and AIDY392S-Sepharose beads did not bind the β subunits in the tissue extracts. The β1a and β3 subunits were not detected in the homogenates and voids (approximately 100 μg of each analyzed on SDS-PAGE) of the bead assay. These results indicate that there are β subunits which are not tightly complexed with the α1 subunits. Coexpression studies with the α1 and β subunits in Xenopus oocytes have shown that the β subunit modulates the properties of the α1 subunit by enhancing the current amplitude and altering voltage dependence and kinetics of the resulting Ca2+ channels(13Lacerda A.E. Kim H.S. Ruth P. Perez-Reyes E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Birnbaumer L. Brown A.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 527-530Google Scholar, 14Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Google Scholar, 15Varadi G. Lory P. Schultz D. Varadi M. Schwartz A. Nature. 1991; 352: 159-162Google Scholar, 16Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Google Scholar, 17De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Google Scholar). These studies have shown that β subunits which are tightly associated with α1 subunits play an important role in modulating the properties of the pore-forming α1 subunit. Nonassociated β subunits may also play a role in Ca2+ homeostasis. It is possible that nonassociated β subunits could be shuttled to the membrane to bind with α1 subunits upon electrical or chemical stimulation of the membrane or by the result of intracellular signaling events such as protein phosphorylation. These β subunits would then associate with α1 subunits in the plasma membrane to increase their Ca2+ channel current amplitudes and alter their voltage dependence and kinetics. AIDA CNBr-Sepharose beads were used to purify β subunits from solubilized skeletal muscle triads. In Fig. 8A, SDS-PAGE demonstrated that a protein of a molecular mass of 52 kDa eluted from the AIDA CNBr-Sepharose column at low pH in fractions 9 and 10. Immunoblot analysis with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies from Rabbit 62 confirmed the identification of the 52-kDa protein as the β1a subunit (Fig. 8B). With the use of the AIDA affinity assay, the purified β1a subunit retains its ability to bind to the AIDA-Sepharose affinity beads but not the mutant AIDY392S-Sepharose beads (data not shown). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that both nonconservative and conservative mutations in the tyrosine residue of the AID have a profound effect on the ability of the AID to bind to β subunits. Deletion of the aromatic ring containing the hydroxyl group disrupted the subunit-subunit interaction. Furthermore, a deletion of only the hydroxyl group on the tyrosine had a dramatic effect on β subunits binding to the AIDA, suggesting that this hydroxyl group may play an important role in the molecular interactions between α1 and β subunits. Our results also illustrate that the AID binds to native β subunits in both detergent and non-detergent tissue extracts. This not only provides a unique method of characterizing different β subunits from various tissues but also suggests that β subunits may not always be tightly associated with α1 subunits. We thank C.

https://openalex.org/W2018801384,"The higher plant chloroplast chaperonins (ch-cpn60 and ch-cpn10) have been purified and their structural/functional properties examined. In all plants surveyed, both proteins were constitutively expressed, and only modest increases in their levels were detected upon heat shock. Like GroEL and GroES of Escherichia coli, the chloroplast chaperonins can physically interact with each other. The asymmetric complexes that form in the presence of ADP are “bullet-shaped” particles that likely consist of 1 mol each of ch-cpn60 and ch-cpn10. The purified ch-cpn60 is a functional molecular chaperone. Under “nonpermissive” conditions, where spontaneous folding was not observed, it was able to assist in the refolding of two different target proteins. In both cases, successful partitioning to the native state also required ATP hydrolysis and chaperonin 10. Surprisingly, however, the “double-domain” ch-cpn10, comprised of unique 21-kDa subunits, was not an obligatory co-chaperonin. Both GroES and a mammalian mitochondrial homolog were equally compatible with the ch-cpn60. Finally, the assisted-folding reaction mediated by the chloroplast chaperonins does not require K+ ions. Thus, the K+-dependent ATPase activity that is observed with other known groEL homologs is not a universal property of all chaperonin 60s.

They are found in all eubacteria and those eucaryotic organelles that derived from procaryotes through the process of endosymbiosis (e.g. chloroplasts and mitochondria). Despite their ubiquity, however, most of our insight as to how they function comes from studies on GroEL (cpn60) and GroES (cpn10), the prototypical chaperonins of Escherichia coli. This trend will likely continue, fueled by the recent crystal structure of GroEL at 2.8 Å(4Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Google Scholar).GroEL consists of two stacked rings of seven identical subunits (GroEL14). On its own it binds tenaciously to a wide variety of nonnative proteins(5Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Google Scholar). While such interactions effectively suppress aggregation(6Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T.

Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Google Scholar), they also interfere with “on-path” folding events(8Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U.

Gatenby A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Google Scholar). Fortunately, GroEL possesses an ATPase activity (11Hendrix R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 375-392Google Scholar), and in the presence of ATP and some of its analogs(8Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2767-2772Google Scholar), it oscillates between states of high and low affinity for nonnative proteins. However, there is a caveat: while release of the bound protein is necessary for folding to resume, it is not always sufficient to ensure proper folding(8Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Google Scholar, 16Zheng X. Rosenberg L.E. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7489-7493Google Scholar, 17Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Google Scholar). Depending on both the folding environment (17Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Google Scholar) and the stability of the particular GroEL/target protein complex(18Staniforth R.A. Corts A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 129-135Google Scholar, 19Schmidt M. Bcheler U. Kaluza B. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27964-27972Google Scholar), productive release may also require the participation of the co-chaperonin, GroES.GroES is a single ring heptamer (groES7). It too forms complexes with GroEL, but only in the presence of adenine nucleotides(20Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Google Scholar, 21Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Google Scholar). This interaction inhibits GroEL's ATPase activity (8Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Google Scholar, 12Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A.

Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Google Scholar) and enhances its cooperativity(23Gray T.E. Fersht A.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 254-258Google Scholar). In the presence of ADP alone, the two chaperonins form an asymmetric “dead-end” complex that contains 1 mol of GroEL14, 1 mol of GroES7, and 7 mol of tightly bound ADP(22Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Google Scholar). Side views of such particles are “bullet-shaped,” with GroES bound to only one end of the GroEL cylinder(24Saibil H.R. Zheng D. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Watson G.M.F. Chen S. auf der Maur A. O'Hara B.P. Wood S.P. Mann N.H. Barnett L.K. Ellis R.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 265-273Google Scholar). In contrast, when the asymmetric complex is challenged with ATP, a dynamic cycle of events is set in motion(25Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Google Scholar). Following a single round of ATP hydrolysis by the unoccupied GroEL toroid, the originally bound GroES and ADP are completely released. However, if sufficient GroES is also present, the cycle of breakdown and reformation of asymmetric complexes proceeds through symmetrical “football-shaped” intermediates that contain 1 mol of GroEL14 and 2 mol of GroES7(26Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Google Scholar, 27Azem A. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Science. 1994; 265: 653-656Google Scholar).It has been proposed (25Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Google Scholar) that GroES “quantizes” the hydrolysis of ATP by GroEL, thus committing all of the subunits in one ring to hydrolyze ATP simultaneously and convert to their low affinity state in synchrony. This ensures the transient but complete release of the unfolded protein substrate(25Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Google Scholar, 28Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Google Scholar), affording it an opportunity to fold unhindered in solution. Should it fail to partition to its native state, rebinding to GroEL would occur, and this interaction could potentially facilitate the “unfolding” of kinetically trapped, misfolded species(12Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Google Scholar, 25Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Google Scholar, 28Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Google Scholar, 29Zahn R. Spitzfaden C. Ottiger M. Wthrich K. Plckthun A. Nature. 1994; 368: 261-265Google Scholar). In any event, the assisted-folding reaction is an iterative process (25Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Google Scholar, 28Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Google Scholar) and, depending on the target protein, may require many cycles of release and rebinding before the native state is achieved.Many of these observations are likely relevant to other chaperonins. However, there are at least two features that clearly distinguish the higher plant chloroplast chaperonins from their bacterial and mitochondrial counterparts. First, the ch-cpn60 consists of roughly equal amounts of two different subunits, α and β(30Hemmingsen S.M. Ellis R.J. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 269-276Google Scholar, 31Musgrove J.E. Johnson R.A. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 529-534Google Scholar), that are no more similar to each other than they are to GroEL(32Martel R. Cloney L.P. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 94: 181-187Google Scholar). It is not known whether α and β reside in the same or different tetradecamers. Second, the ch-cpn10 subunit is nearly twice the size of other GroES homologs(33Bertsch U. Soll J. Seetharam R. Viitanen P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8696-8700Google Scholar). It consists of two complete cpn10 molecules that are fused “head-to-tail” to form a single protein. Both “halves” of the binary ch-cpn10 can function autonomously in GroES-deficient mutants(34Baneyx F. Bertsch U. Kalbach C.E. van der Vies S.M. Soll J. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 10695-10702Google Scholar).Prior to its recognition as the chloroplast cpn60(1Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Google Scholar), “the large subunit binding protein” (35Barraclough R. Ellis R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 608: 19-31Google Scholar) was implicated in the assembly of the higher plant Rubisco, a hexadecamer comprised of eight large and eight small subunits. Assembly occurs in the chloroplast stroma, following post-translational import of the small subunits. However, numerous studies have shown that the holoenzyme does not assemble spontaneously (35Barraclough R. Ellis R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 608: 19-31Google Scholar, 36Roy H. Bloom M. Milos P. Monroe M. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 20-27Google Scholar, 37Bloom M.V. Milos P. Roy H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1013-1017Google Scholar, 38Hubbs A.E. Roy H. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 272-281Google Scholar, 39Hubbs A.E. Roy H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 523-533Google Scholar). Indeed, the nascent large subunits initially form a stable complex with the ch-cpn60. Then, in a complicated and poorly understood set of reactions, the bound large subunits are discharged in an ATP-dependent manner (37Bloom M.V. Milos P. Roy H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1013-1017Google Scholar) and are subsequently incorporated into the Rubisco holoenzyme(38Hubbs A.E. Roy H. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 272-281Google Scholar, 39Hubbs A.E. Roy H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 523-533Google Scholar, 40Cannon S. Wang P. Roy H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1327-1335Google Scholar). The chloroplast chaperonins are also necessary for the in vitro reconstitution of active CF1 core particles(41Chen G.G. Jagendorf A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11497-11501Google Scholar). More generally, a variety of proteins imported into isolated chloroplasts stably interact with the ch-cpn60(42Lubben T.H. Donaldson G.K. Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 1223-1230Google Scholar). These findings, coupled with the pleiotropic defects that were observed in transgenic plants expressing low levels of the β ch-cpn60(43Zabaleta E. Oropeza A. Assad N. Mandel A. Salerno G. Herrera-Estrella L. Plant J. 1994; 6: 425-432Google Scholar), suggest that the chloroplast chaperonins play a prominent role plastid protein folding. However, a detailed characterization of the assisted-folding reaction mediated by these proteins is currently lacking.In the present study, we have purified the higher plant ch-cpn60 and its unique binary co-chaperonin (33Bertsch U. Soll J. Seetharam R. Viitanen P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8696-8700Google Scholar, 34Baneyx F. Bertsch U. Kalbach C.E. van der Vies S.M. Soll J. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 10695-10702Google Scholar) and examined their structural and functional interactions. While there are many similarities between the chloroplast proteins and the GroEL/GroES model system, there are also important fundamental differences. For example, in contrast to GroEL (21Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Google Scholar, 22Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Google Scholar) and its mitochondrial counterparts(44Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Seetharam R. Gupta R.S. Oppenheim J. Thomas J.O. Cowan N.J. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 10967-10971Google Scholar), the assisted-folding reaction mediated by the ch-cpn60 does not require K+ ions. Thus, in addition to providing new insight as to how the chloroplast chaperonins function, our results highlight the importance of studying multiple systems when attempting to formulate a universal mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[14C]Carbonate was from DuPont NEN.

The TSK 3000 gel filtration column (type G3000SW, 7.5 × 600 mm) and the HPLC-hydroxylapatite column (MAPS HPHT, 50 × 25 mm) were from Supelco and Bio-Rad, respectively. GroEL, GroES, and the dimeric Rubisco from Rhodospirillum rubrum were purified and quantitated as previously described(17Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol.

Cells were induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside at an A600 of 1.0 and were harvested 3-15 h later. Unless otherwise noted, subsequent steps were at 4°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2.5 volumes of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM DTT, 0.03 mg/ml DNase I, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and passed twice through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Debris was removed by centrifugation (105× g, 2 h), and the supernatant, containing ~37 mg of protein/ml, was supplemented with 5% glycerol and stored at −80°C.The cell-free extract (35 ml) was exchanged into 20 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.2, 0.5 mM DTT (buffer A),2 2All pH values cited in the text were obtained at room temperature. and equally applied to seven columns, each containing 4 ml (settled bed volume) of S-Sepharose Fast Flow, pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The columns were washed three times with 8 ml of buffer A, and ch-cpn10 was then eluted with 10 ml of 0.3 M NaCl in buffer A. The high salt eluents were combined, supplemented with 5% glycerol, and concentrated to ~15 mg of protein/ml. After exchange into 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.01 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, the entire sample (~250 mg total protein) was applied to an HPLC-hydroxylapatite column, pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was developed at 25°C (3 ml/min) with a linear gradient (150 ml) of 10-500 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8). Fractions eluting between ~195 and 250 mM sodium phosphate were pooled, supplemented with 5% glycerol, and concentrated to ~35 mg of protein/ml.This material (~115 mg of total protein) was then exchanged into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.5 mM DTT (buffer B), and applied to a Mono Q HR 10/10 column. The column was developed at 25°C (3.5 ml/min) with a linear gradient (125 ml) of 0-0.5 M NaCl (in buffer B). Purified ch-cpn10 eluted between 180 and 210 mM NaCl. It was supplemented with glycerol (5%), concentrated to ~10 mg of protein/ml, and stored at −80°C; the final yield was ~40 mg. The protein concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Edman degradation of the purified protein produced the following sequence: ASITTSKYTSVKPLGDRVLI. Thus, the initiator Met, added for expression in E. coli(34Baneyx F. Bertsch U. Kalbach C.E. van der Vies S.M. Soll J. Gatenby A.A. J.

Hracky R. Soll J. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42c: 103-108Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were lysed at a chlorophyll concentration of ~1.5 mg/ml, by resuspension in ice-cold 10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA. Debris was removed by centrifugation (25,000 × g, 60 min), and the supernatant was fractionated on a Mono Q HR 10/10 column, equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mM EDTA. The column was developed at 25°C (4 ml/min) with a linear gradient (320 ml) of 0-0.7 M NaCl. Ch-cpn60 eluted between 300 and 350 mM NaCl, well resolved from the Rubisco holoenzyme. The pooled fractions were supplemented with 5% glycerol and 10 mM MgCl2, and concentrated to ~10 mg of protein/ml.Further purification was achieved using ATP-agarose(48Yuan J.C. Henry R. Cline K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8552-8556Google Scholar). A column containing 3 ml of the swollen resin (settled bed volume) was equilibrated at 4°C with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.4 M NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA (buffer C). The column outlet was then closed, and 3 ml of the Mono Q pool were applied to the resin. After a 1-h adsorption period (with occasional stirring), the column was washed six times with 4 ml of buffer C. The resin was then incubated for 30 min with 4 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 M NaCl, 15 mM EDTA, and the ch-cpn60-containing eluent was subsequently collected. The EDTA elution step was repeated six times, and the combined eluents were fractionated on a TSK 3000 gel filtration column. The column was developed at 25°C (1 ml/min) with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.3 M NaCl. Purified ch-cpn60 eluted in the column's void volume. It was supplemented with 5% glycerol, concentrated to ~12 mg/ml, and stored at −80°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(49Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Edman degradation confirmed that the purified pea ch-cpn60 consists of roughly equal amounts of α and β subunits(31Musgrove J.E. Johnson R.A. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 529-534Google Scholar).Chaperonin-assisted Folding ReactionsExperiments are described in the figure legends. Acid-denatured Rubisco and urea-denatured mMDH were prepared as previously described(17Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Google Scholar). To quantitate refolding, parallel experiments were performed using the non-denatured target proteins. Rubisco and mMDH activities were measured as described elsewhere(17Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Google Scholar).Electron MicroscopyAsymmetric chaperonin complexes were formed by incubating ch-cpn60 (6 μM) and ch-cpn10 (15 μM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, and 2.5 mM ADP for 1.5 h at 25°C. The samples were negatively stained with 3% uranyl acetate(26Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Google Scholar), and electron micrographs were recorded with a Philips EM 420 and CM 12 at a nominal magnification of 60,000. Suitably covered areas of the micrographs were scanned by densitometry using an EIKONIX CCD camara with a step size of 15 μm. Individual side and top views were selected and aligned with respect to translation and orientation, using standard correlation techniques in the SEMPER program system (Synoptics, Cambridge, UK). A Gaussian profile smoothing kernel was applied to the individual images to improve the recognition of the basic structural features(50Saxton W.O. Pitt T.J. Horner M. Ultramicroscopy. 1973; 4: 343-354Google Scholar).Analysis of Heat-Shock ProteinsThe effect of heat shock on the ch-cpn60, ch-cpn10, and HSP-21 was assessed in corn (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum), kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgarus), pea (P. sativum), tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolius), and arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). At the time of stress, the plants were 14, 7, 14, 10, 14, and 28 days old, respectively. The heat-shock protocol was essentially as described elsewhere(46Chen Q. Lauzon L.M. DeRocher A.E. Vierling E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1873-1883Google Scholar). Leaf tissues were placed in a humidified growth chamber, and the temperature was raised from 22 to 40°C, at a rate of 4°C/h. The chamber was held at 40°C for 4 h, and the temperature was then restored to 22°C, at the same rate of change. Plant tissues were homogenized in SDS sample buffer(51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and debris was removed by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were estimated as described by Ghosh et al.(52Ghosh S. Gepstein S. Heikkila J.J. Dumbroff E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 227-233Google Scholar).Other MethodsProteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 15% gels(51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). For Western blots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, reacted with the appropriate primary antiserum, and then sequentially probed with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, both of which were from Vector Labs.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe Chloroplast Chaperonins as Heat-Shock ProteinsThe protomer molecular mass of the higher plant ch-cpn10 is twice that of its bacterial and mitochondrial counterparts(33Bertsch U. Soll J. Seetharam R. Viitanen P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8696-8700Google Scholar). The structural basis for this apparent anomaly is that the chloroplast co-chaperonin actually consists of two complete GroES-like molecules that are fused in tandom to form a single protein. Both domains are highly conserved at a number of residues that are thought to be important for cpn10 function. While a more conventional GroES homolog might also exist in chloroplasts, no such species have yet been identified. It is generally suspected that the binary organization of the ch-cpn10 reflects some special adaptation of higher plants that has occurred in response to their possession of two divergent cpn60 isoforms(32Martel R. Cloney L.P. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 94: 181-187Google Scholar). Regardless, this unique chaperonin is restricted to photosynthetic eucaryotes and is widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom(34Baneyx F. Bertsch U. Kalbach C.E. van der Vies S.M. Soll J. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 10695-10702Google Scholar).Based on metabolic labeling studies, Hand co-workers have concluded that the ch-cpn60 of barley is heat-inducible(53Hartman D.J. Dougan D. Hoogenraad N.J.H.P.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 147-150Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine the effect of thermal stress on the higher plant ch-cpn10. To address this issue, antibodies were raised against the purified chloroplast chaperonins, and these were used to survey a variety of higher plants under normal and heat-shock conditions. As a positive control, the expression of the small chloroplast heat-shock protein, HSP21(46Chen Q. Lauzon L.M. DeRocher A.E. Vierling E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1873-1883Google Scholar), was also monitored. In the absence of thermal stress, immunologically detectable levels of the binary ch-cpn10 were present in all plants examined (Fig. 1A), including both monocots (lanes 9-12) and dicots (lanes 1-8). Constitutive expression of the ch-cpn60 was also observed in these samples (Fig. 1B). However, in contrast to HSP21, the levels of which increased dramatically at elevated temperature (Fig. 1C), the chloroplast chaperonins were only marginally affected by thermal stress (odd- versus even-numbered lanes). Visual inspection of a number of immuno-blots, similar to those shown in Fig. 1, gave the impression that small increases in ch-cpn60 and/or ch-cpn10 may have occurred in some of the plants in response to heat shock. However, such changes were rarely greater than 2-fold. In the absence of other evidence, we conclude that the levels of the chloroplast chaperonins are little influenced by heat stress conditions that might be encountered in the natural environment(46Chen Q. Lauzon L.M. DeRocher A.E. Vierling E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1873-1883Google Scholar).The Chloroplast Chaperonins Form Asymmetric Complexes in the Presence of ADPThe ch-cpn10 was initially identified through its ability to form a stable complex with the bacterial GroEL protein, a reaction that strictly requires adenine nucleotides(33Bertsch U. Soll J. Seetharam R. Viitanen P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992"
https://openalex.org/W1970637755,"Lactogenic hormone-dependent expression of the rat β-casein gene in mammary epithelial cells is controlled via a complex regulatory region in the promoter. The sequence between −176 and −82 is the minimal region to confer the response to glucocorticoid hormone and prolactin on a heterologous promoter. The response is further enhanced by the region between −282 and −176. DNase I footprinting experiments and electromobility shift assays revealed the presence of four binding sites for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) isoforms in the hormone response region between −220 and −132. In nuclear extracts from mammary epithelial cells, the prevalent C/EBP isoform binding to these sites is β (C/EBP-β). C/EBP-δ is also present in mammary epithelial cells, whereas C/EBP-α is not detectable. The C/EBP sites are located in close proximity to the previously characterized binding sites for the prolactin-inducible mammary gland factor/signal transducer and activator of transcription-5, the nuclear factor YY1, and the glucocorticoid receptor. The importance of the two proximal C/EBP binding sites at the 5′ border of the minimal region was tested by mutational analysis. Mutations of each site were found to inhibit strongly both the basal and the lactogenic hormone-induced transcription of a β-casein gene promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct. The results implicate C/EBPs as important regulators of β-casein gene expression in the mammary epithelium. Lactogenic hormone-dependent expression of the rat β-casein gene in mammary epithelial cells is controlled via a complex regulatory region in the promoter. The sequence between −176 and −82 is the minimal region to confer the response to glucocorticoid hormone and prolactin on a heterologous promoter. The response is further enhanced by the region between −282 and −176.

Mutations of each site were found to inhibit strongly both the basal and the lactogenic hormone-induced transcription of a β-casein gene promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct. The results implicate C/EBPs as important regulators of β-casein gene expression in the mammary epithelium. Multiple cis-acting elements are involved in ensuring the correct stage and tissue-specific expression of the β-casein gene. They have been identified in the promoter region and 5′-flanking sequence(1Doppler W. Groner B. Ball R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 104-108Google Scholar, 2Yoshimura M. Oka T. Proc.

The characterization of the nuclear factors binding to these elements has led to the discovery of both positively and negatively acting factors. Positively acting are two hormone-inducible factors, namely the mammary gland factor MGF1 1The abbreviations used are: MGFmammary gland factorSTATsignal transducer and activator of transcriptionLHRRlactogenic hormone response regionEMSAelectromobility shift assayC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)fpfootprint. (4Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Google Scholar), and the glucocorticoid receptor (5Welte T. Philipp S. Cairns C. Gustafsson J.-A. Doppler W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 47: 75-81Google Scholar). MGF is induced in its DNA binding by prolactin (6Standke G.J.R. Meier V.S. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 469-477Google Scholar, 7Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Doppler W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1091-1102Google Scholar) and was shown to be a novel member of the STAT family (STAT5(8Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Google Scholar)). It binds to an essential site in the promoter which is crucial for the response to prolactin(4Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Google Scholar, 7Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Doppler W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1091-1102Google Scholar). The significance of the glucocorticoid receptor binding sites in the promoter is presently not clear, since glucocorticoid hormones appear to act indirectly on the transcription of the β-casein gene(9Doppler W. Hck W. Hofer P. Groner B. Ball R.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 912-919Google Scholar). Three factors have been described to be involved in the repression of transcription: pregnancy-specific mammary nuclear factor(10Lee C.S. Oka T. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2257-2262Google Scholar), single-stranded DNA-binding factor(11Altiok S. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7303-7310Google Scholar, 12Altiok S. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6004-6012Google Scholar), and the nuclear factor YY1(13Meier V.S. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 128-137Google Scholar, 14Raught B. Khursheed B. Kazanasky A. Rosen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1752-1763Google Scholar). Whereas YY1 is constitutively expressed in mammary epithelial cells, both pregnancy-specific mammary nuclear factor and single-stranded DNA-binding factor are regulated in their activity. Pregnancy-specific mammary nuclear factor is down-regulated in the absence of progesterone and is thus considered as a mediator of the repression of β-casein gene transcription during pregnancy. Single-stranded DNA-binding factor is sequestered by β-casein mRNA. It is discussed as a component of a positive feedback loop that is initiated after the induction of β-casein gene transcription. mammary gland factor signal transducer and activator of transcription lactogenic hormone response region electromobility shift assay CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) footprint. Although several trans-acting factors have been described to be important for the regulation of the β-casein gene, the factors mediating the minimal response of the promoter to lactogenic hormones, and the minimal cis-acting sequence in the lactogenic hormone response region (LHRR) required for this response have not been defined so far. Single copies or multimers of the MGF/STAT5 binding site were not sufficient for conferring the response to lactogenic hormones in mammary epithelial cells(6Standke G.J.R. Meier V.S. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 469-477Google Scholar). With heterologous promoter constructs we show here that the minimal response region of the rat β-casein gene extends from −176 to −82 and includes in addition to the proximal MGF/STAT5 and YY1 sites a functional element located in the 5′ half, which has not been characterized so far. To identify nuclear factors that bind to this critical 5′ region, DNase I footprinting experiments and electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed with extracts of mammary epithelial cells. The studies revealed the presence of four C/EBP binding sites in the LHRR. The binding sites were localized in the region of the 5′ border of the minimal element and at the positions −220 and −142. The functional significance of the sites at the 5′ border was confirmed by mutational analysis. C/EBPs comprise a family of isoforms encoded by separate genes(15McKnight S.L. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 771-795Google Scholar, 16Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 127: 25-50Google Scholar) which share a highly similar carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain and leucine zipper dimerization domain but have different amino-terminal effector domains. The genes of the individual C/EBP isoforms are expressed differentially in a restricted set of tissues. The C/EBP isoforms α, β, and δ (C/EBP-α, -β, and -δ, respectively) have been implicated previously as important determinants for the specific expression of genes in various terminal differentiated tissues other than the mammary gland. They were discovered to be important regulatory factors in the induction of differentiation-specific genes in myelomonocytic cells(17Scott L.M. Civin C.I. Rorth P. Friedman A.D.

Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2327-2333Google Scholar) and of the intestinal epithelium(30Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8871-8875Google Scholar). To find out which of these C/EBP isoforms is expressed in mouse mammary epithelial cells, EMSAs and immunoblotting experiments were performed with isoform-specific antibodies. The obtained data point to an important role of C/EBP-β in the mediation of stage-specific expression in the mammary gland. HC11 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom; Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biochrom), 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo. U. S. A.), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Prior to hormone treatment, the confluent cultures were kept for 2 days in an epidermal growth factor-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 5 μg/ml insulin. 5 μg/ml ovine prolactin (31 units/mg, Sigma) and 0.1 μM dexamethasone (Sigma) were added to this medium, and cells were cultured for an additional 4 days. Control cultures were cultivated in the absence of prolactin and dexamethasone. The cells were stably transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described (31Doppler W. Villunger A. Jennewein P. Brduscha A. Groner B. Ball R.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1624-1632Google Scholar, 32Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Jennewein P. Huck C. Cato A.C.B. Doppler W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 997-1006Google Scholar) with 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 1 μg of pSV2neo (33Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341Google Scholar) per 10-cm culture dish. One hundred to 1,000 colonies resistant to the antibiotic G418 (200 μg/ml) were pooled and cultured further in G418-containing medium. The preparation of cell extracts and determination of CAT activity were as described in (31Doppler W. Villunger A. Jennewein P. Brduscha A. Groner B. Ball R.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1624-1632Google Scholar). The heterologous β-casein gene thymidine kinase (tk) promoter CAT constructs were prepared by inserting PCR-generated β-casein gene fragments of the indicated promoter regions into the 5′ polylinker of the −105 tk CAT expression vector pBLCAT2(34Luckow B. Schtz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides with engineered restriction sites at their 5′ ends were employed as primers for the PCR. The sense primer used to create fragments with a 5′ border at −344 was 5′ATCGGATCCTCTCTAAAGCTTGTGAAT3′. Fragments with 5′ end points at −282, −175, −157, and −105 were amplified with the sense primer 5′TTGGTCGACGACTCACTTTAGGGCGAAT3′, and plasmid templates of the 5′ deletion series pbsβc(X/+487)CAT(9Doppler W. Hck W. Hofer P. Groner B. Ball R.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 912-919Google Scholar). The primer binds to the invariant vector sequence of the plasmids next to the variable 5′ deletion end point of the β-casein gene promoter. Antisense primers for creating fragments with a defined 3′ border of the β-casein gene fragment were: 5′AAGGGATCCTGGGGGACATTAAACAAGGC3′ (border at −147), 5′TAGGGATCCGTTTCTTTCTATTTTCTTTC3′(−117), 5′CTTGGATCCAAGAAGTTCCACATGATT3′(−89), 5′AAAGGATCCTTAATTCCAAGAAGTTC3′ (−82), and 5′ATGGGATCCTAATTTGTGGTTCGTAAGA3′(−51). Mutations creating a novel HindIII site were introduced into the β-casein gene promoter construct pβc(−344/-1)CAT (9Doppler W. Hck W. Hofer P. Groner B. Ball R.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 912-919Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis using the protocol of Deng and Nickoloff (35Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Google Scholar). The selection primer was 5′CCCCGGGTACAGATCTCGAATTCGT3′, which destroys the unique SacI and KpnI cutting sites, replacing them with a BglII site. The primers used for mutation of the promoter with the novel HindIII sites were: 5′CCTTCACCAGAAGCTTAATTGCTGCC3′ (−181, Bm1), 5′AGCTTCTGAAGCTTTGCCTTGTTT3′ (−175, Bm3), 5′ACCAGCTTCTGAATTGCTGAAGCTTTTAATGTC3′ (−167, Bm4), and 5′CCTTGTTTAAGCTTCCCCAGAATT3′ (−159, Bm5). The position of the introduced HindIII site in the β-casein gene promoter and the name of the corresponding mutated oligonucleotides employed in EMSA (see Fig. 4) are shown in parentheses. Mutations were verified by sequencing. Preparation of nuclear extracts for EMSA, DNase I footprinting, and immunoblotting experiments were carried out as described(32Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Jennewein P. Huck C. Cato A.C.B. Doppler W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 997-1006Google Scholar). Extracts were stored in aliquots at −70°C and only thawed once before use. DNA-templates were generated by PCR amplification of the relevant region using end-labeled oligonucleotides as primers. The PCR product was isolated from a 1.5% agarose gel with the glassmilk-based Mermaid Kit (Bio 101). The purified DNA-template (13,000 cpm in 1.5 μl) was added to 10 μl of nuclear extract diluted with 2.5 μl of 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 240 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 40 mM MgCl2, and 1 μl of poly(dI-dC) (1 μg/μl) at 4°C. The samples were then kept for 15 min at 21°C and 15 min at 4°C. Two microliters of DNase I diluted in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mM CaCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin was added (7-60 ng of DNase I, depending on the amount of extract); after 2 min at 4°C the reaction was stopped with 50 μl of freshly prepared stop solution (50 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 500 μg/ml proteinase K). The samples were kept at 50°C for 30 min, extracted with phenol-chloroform (1:1) mixture and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed on a 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE electrophoresis buffer (0.089 M Tris, 0.089 M boric acid, 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). A Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reaction of the DNA-templates (the G-lane) was included as a position marker. Oligonucleotides were radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (>6,000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by phenol extraction and Sephadex G-50 chromatography. After a treatment for 5 min at 95°C, complementary oligonucleotides were annealed in 250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mM MgCl2 by a slow temperature decrease from 70°C to room temperature. Ten-μg nuclear extracts or whole cell extracts and 50,000 cpm of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (30-50 fmol) were incubated on ice for 30 min prior to electrophoresis in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 6 mM sodium phosphate, 52.5 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1.35 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 3.5% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.50 nM unlabeled single-stranded oligonucleotide. The single-stranded oligonucleotide was included to compete for the binding of unspecific proteins binding to single-stranded DNA. Where indicated, the C/EBP isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies sc-61, sc-150, and sc-151 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the corresponding blocking peptides, or double-stranded oligonucleotides were added to the extracts prior to the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide and incubated on ice for 30 min. Probes were mixed with 2 μl of loading buffer (25% Ficoll 400, 0.25% bromphenol blue) and loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE electrophoresis buffer (0.022 M Tris, 0.022 M boric acid, 0.05 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Prerun and electrophoresis of 3 h each were performed at room temperature at 10 V/cm with recirculation of electrophoresis buffer. The gel was fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. Nuclear extracts were subjected to electrophoresis on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Membranes were incubated with 0.25 μg/ml polyclonal C/EBP-β antiserum sc-150 directed against a carboxyl-terminal peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized by use of a secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Corp.) and the Amersham Enhanced Chemiluminescence system. The −344/-1 fragment of the rat β-casein gene promoter was shown to mediate the synergistic effects of prolactin and glucocorticoid hormones on the transcription of a linked chloramphenicol reporter gene in the stably transfected mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11(9Doppler W. Hck W. Hofer P. Groner B. Ball R.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 912-919Google Scholar). We searched for the minimal sequence element within this fragment which confers hormone responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. β-Casein gene promoter sequences with defined 5′ and 3′ ends were amplified with PCR. The basic promoter fragments extending from −344 to −51 and from −344 to −82 lacked the octamer site between −55 and −48 (36Groenen M.A.M. Dijkhof R.J.M. van der Poel J.J. van Diggelen R. Verstege E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4311-4318Google Scholar) but contained the sites for MGF between −97 and −87 (4Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Google Scholar) and the nuclear factor YY1 between −118 and −112 (13Meier V.S. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 128-137Google Scholar). These fragments were ligated in front of the −105 tk promoter, which has in addition to the TATA box two sites for the transcription factor Sp1 and one site for CCAAT transcription factor/nuclear factor 1 (CTF/NF1)(37Jones K.A. Yamamoto K.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1985; 42: 559-572Google Scholar). The insertion of the β-casein gene sequences conferred the response to lactogenic hormones on the heterologous promoter (Fig. 1A). The induction ratios were lower than observed with the −344/-1 β-casein gene promoter constructs (see (9Doppler W. Hck W. Hofer P. Groner B. Ball R.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 912-919Google Scholar) and Table 1 of this study), indicating that the octamer site and/or other sequence elements between position −51 and −1 of the β-casein gene facilitate the response to lactogenic hormones. The location of the minimal lactogenic hormone response element was mapped by further removal of 5′ and 3′ sequence. Removal of the sequence between −344 and −282 did not alter the function of the LHRR significantly (Fig. 1A, compare third and fourth constructs). This was expected since the deletion did not extend beyond the limit of the first 5′ border of the hormone response element identified in previous experiments(1Doppler W. Groner B. Ball R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 104-108Google Scholar). Elimination of the MGF recognition site between −89 and −82 led to a complete loss of the lactogenic hormone-dependent activity (Fig. 1A, fifth construct). This is in accordance with the results of β-casein gene promoter constructs, where the MGF site was inactivated by point mutations(4Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Google Scholar, 7Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Doppler W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1091-1102Google Scholar). Removal of both the YY1 and MGF sites by deletion of the sequence between −117 and −82 resulted in a construct that did not respond to lactogenic hormones but had in comparison with the −105 tk promoter alone a 7-fold increase of the hormone-independent promoter activity (Fig. 1A, compare first construct with sixth construct). A similar observation was made with a construct in which the sequence between −147 and −82 was deleted (seventh construct of Fig. 1A). Our data indicate the presence of a hormone-independent enhancer element in the region between −282 and −147, which is repressed in the intact β-casein gene promoter by the region comprising the YY1 site(13Meier V.S. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 128-137Google Scholar). The major factor mediating the repression is probably the factor YY1 itself, as described previously(13Meier V.S. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 128-137Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B, the role of the region between −176 and −157 for the response to lactogenic hormones was investigated. The 95-bp sequence extending from −176 to −82 was found to be sufficient to confer the lactogenic hormone response to the −105 tk promoter (Fig. 1B, second construct), whereas the shortened promoter fragment spanning the sequence between −157 and −82 had lost this property (third construct). Thus the sequence between −176 and −157 is important for the minimal response to lactogenic hormones. The sequence did not function per se as a lactogenic hormone response element (fourth construct of Fig. 1B). Its function required the presence of both the repressor region and the MGF site. Taken together, the data define a minimal LHRR between −176 and −82, which can be subdivided into at least three functional domains: the novel cis-acting element at the 5′ border defined in the present study; the MGF/STAT5 site at 3′ border; and a repressor region in between, which harbors a YY1 site. A systematic investigation on the nuclear factors binding to the 3′ region of the LHRR employing DNase I footprinting and oligonucleotide competition experiments was performed previously by Schmitt-Ney et al.(4Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Google Scholar). Two of the factors binding to that region were identified later at the molecular level as MGF/STAT5 (8Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Google Scholar) and YY1(13Meier V.S. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 128-137Google Scholar). The proteins binding to the 5′ region of the LHRR have not been examined in greater detail. To localize binding sites within this region, we performed DNase I footprinting experiments with a PCR-generated mouse β-casein gene fragment which extends into the 5′ half of the LHRR. Four major regions were found to be protected by nuclear extracts prepared from the mammary gland of pregnant animals, lactogenic hormone-induced HC11 cells, and uninduced HC11 cells (footprints fp1-fp4 of Fig. 2). The protection in footprint fp2 was weaker than in the other footprinted regions. In the experiment of Fig. 2 and other experiments (not shown), there was no significant difference in the protection pattern obtained with extracts derived from cells induced with hormones or untreated controls. Fp1 was outside the minimal LHRR and covered the sequence between −237 and −202, whereas footprints fp2 to fp4 were within the minimal LHRR. The position of footprint fp2, which extended from −182 to −151, was most interesting, since it is in the region of the critical cis-acting sequence at the 5′ border of the minimal LHRR (Fig. 1B). The mouse promoter sequence was aligned with the rat sequence (Fig. 3) and the conserved regions inspected for transcription factor binding sites. Thereby, four putative sites for C/EBP were found (Fig. 3). They are all contained within the regions protected in the DNase I footprint experiment. The sites in footprints fp1 and fp3 closely fit the consensus sequence for the C/EBP binding sites(15McKnight S.L. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 771-795Google Scholar, 16Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 127: 25-50Google Scholar, 38Chen H.-M. Liao W.S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25311-25319Google Scholar). In footprint fp2 two more divergent motifs for C/EBP were present.Figure 3:C/EBP binding sites in the murine β-casein gene promoters. The sequences extending from −241 to −80 of the mouse gene (66Kanai A. Nonomura N. Yoshimura M. Oka T. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 195-201Google Scholar) and rat gene (4Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Google Scholar) were aligned. The position of the DNase I footprints fp1-fp3 (Fig. 2) are shown by bars above the mouse sequence. Sequences related to the consensus sequence for C/EBP binding sites are indicated by rectangular boxes. The positions of the binding sites for YY1 and MGF are also shown by boxes. Solid bars below the rat sequence indicate the size and position of oligonucleotides A, B, and C employed for the EMSA experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether the nuclear proteins binding to the three footprinted regions contain C/EBPs, EMSAs were performed with double-stranded oligonucleotides A, B, and C. They include the four putative C/EBP binding sites of the β-casein gene promoter (Fig. 3). The sequences of the oligonucleotides and of the mutated versions employed in oligonucleotide competition experiments are shown in Fig. 4. Nuclear extracts prepared from HC11 cells contained factors that bind to oligonucleotide A and form several complexes with different mobility in the EMSA (Fig. 5A, lane 1). Formation of all complexes was competed with the parental oligonucleotide but not with an oligonucleotide mutated in the C/EBP consensus region (Fig. 5A, lanes 2-5). The results indicate that the nuclear proteins bound to oligonucleotide A have the sequence specificity characteristic for C/EBPs. Additional evidence for the presence of C/EBPs in the complexes formed with oligonucleotide A was obtained by the reactivity of an antibody specific for the C/EBP-β. The antibody reacted with most of the complexes and induced a strong supershift (Fig. 5A, lane 7). A palindromic high affinity C/EBP site (28Cao Z.C. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotides B and C, which contain the other putative C/EBP sites in the β-casein gene promoter, were also able to compete for the binding of the C/EBPs to oligonucleotide A (Fig. 5A, lanes 8, 10, and 11). However, the efficiency of oligonucleotide B to compete was lower, indicating that the sites on B have a reduced affinity for C/EBPs. When the assay was performed with labeled oligonucleotide B, a similar pattern of complexes was observed. Again, the majority of complexes reacted with the C/EBP-β-specific antibody (Fig. 5B, lane 11), and their formation was competed specifically with oligonucleotides containing C/EBP sites (Fig. 5B, lanes 12, 13, and 15). The amount of complexes formed with oligonucleotide B was smaller than with A. This is in accordance with the lower affinity of oligonucleotide B for C/EBPs (Fig. 5A, lane 10) and the weaker footprint fp2 in the DNase I protection assay shown in Fig. 3. Competition experiments were performed with B oligonucleotides mutated in one or both C/EBP sites (Fig. 5B, lanes 3-7). When only one of the two C/EBP sites was mutated (oligonucleotides Bm1, Bm3, and Bm4), the oligonucleotides still were able to compete the binding of C/EBPs to the unmutated oligonucleotide, indicating that one intact C/EBP site was sufficient for binding. In Bm2, mutations were introduced into both C/EBP sites. This abolished the binding activity for the C/EBP complexes (Fig. 5B, lane 6). The result of the EMSA obtained with oligonucleotide C (Fig. 5C) was very similar to the result obtained with oligonucleotide A (Fig. 5A), indicating that the A and C oligonucleotides contain C/EBP binding sites that bind the same set of C/EBPs with similar affinity but do not specifically recognize other nuclear factors contained in mammary epithelial cells. The antibody directed against C/EBP-β reacted with four complexes, which can be most clearly resolved due to their different mobility in experiments performed with oligonucleotide C (Fig. 5C). These complexes were labeled β1 to β4. The different mobility of the complexes might be due to the presence of C/EBP-β proteins with different size, as has been reported(39"

The antibody interacts with exposed residues of an α-helix and surrounding loops adjacent to the lysozyme active site cleft. The epitope of lysozyme bound by antibody F9.13.7 overlaps almost completely with that bound by antibody HyHEL10; the same 12 residues of the antigen interact with the two antibodies. The antibodies, however, have different combining sites with no sequence homology at any of their complementarity-determining regions and show a dissimilar pattern of cross-reactivity with heterologous antigens. Side chain mobility of epitope residues contributes to confer steric and electrostatic complementarity to differently shaped combining sites, allowing functional mimicry to occur. The capacity of two antibodies that have different fine specificities to bind the same area of the antigen emphasizes the operational character of the definition of an antigenic determinant. This example demonstrates that degenerate binding of the same structural motif does not require the existence of sequence homology or other chemical similarities between the different binding sites.

Antibody molecules convey a potentially unlimited molecular diversity and antigen-binding repertoire. Although the genetic elements and mechanisms underlying the generation of this functional and structural diversity have been characterized (43Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Google Scholar), an understanding of the molecular principles that govern antibody specificity remains a major challenge.

Avian egg lysozymes have long served as model antigens for investigating the specificity of immune recognition (for review, see 2Benjamin D.C. Berzofsky J.A. East I.J. Gurd F.R.N. Hannum C.

Cross-reaction studies using panels of evolutionarily related avian lysozymes have identified amino acid residues and the general region of the antigen bound by specific mAbs. Using this test, the antibodies could be grouped by their binding specificities (19Harper M. Lema F. Boulot G. Poljak R.J. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 97-108Google Scholar; 26Lavoie T.B. Drohan W.N.

Biol. 1994; 243: 767-781Google Scholar) have extended these characterizations of antigenic determinants (or epitopes), and common features have emerged from these studies. 1) The lysozyme-antibody interfaces are large (600-800 Å2) and highly complementary. 2) Both the L and H chains of antibodies make extensive contacts with lysozyme, and the specificity of binding is determined by the CDRs. 3) The contacting residues of lysozyme are discontinuous in sequence but form a contiguous surface. 4) van der Waals' interactions, hydrogen bonds, and, to a much lesser extent, salt bridges mediate the binding of antibodies to lysozyme. 5) Small conformational changes in the antibodies and in lysozyme take place upon complex formation. In addition, these x-ray studies indicated that antibody cross-reactivity results from interactions with epitopes that are shared by heterologous lysozymes or that are closely similar and can be contacted by the antibody with minor conformational rearrangements. In the crystal structure of the cross-reaction complex between Fab F9.13.7 and the heterologous antigen GEL, we have found unexpectedly that the epitope bound by F9.13.7 nearly coincides with that bound by the anti-HEL mAb HyHEL10 (11Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Google Scholar). However, mAbs F9.13.7 and HyHEL10 are structurally different in their L and H chains. We discuss how the two antibodies, with unrelated combining sites, achieve specific, high affinity binding to nearly the same epitope of lysozyme. Preparation of the proteins and crystallization of the complex have been described (27Lescar J. Riottot M.-M. Souchon H. Chitarra V. Bentley G.A. Navaza J. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Proteins. 1993; 15: 209-212Google Scholar). The crystals are monoclinic, space group P21, unit cell dimensions a = 83.7 Å, b = 195.5 Å c = 50.2 Å, β = 108.5°, with two molecules of the complex in the asymmetric unit. Crystal instability upon irradiation precluded merging diffraction data from different crystals. A single data set for structure refinement was collected at 4°C using a MARresearch image plate system and synchrotron radiation from beam line D23 at LURE, Orsay, France (λ = 0.986 Å). A total of 111,931 measurements from 180 images (Δω = 1°) were reduced to 30,232 unique intensities (95% complete to 3-Å resolution) with the MOSFLM package (29Leslie A. Crystallographic Computing. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1990: 110-125Google Scholar) and the CCP4 suite (36SERC Daresbury LaboratoryCollaborative Computing Project 4. A Suite of Programs for Protein Crystallography. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1986Google Scholar). The internal merging R-factor is 14% for all data to a nominal resolution of 3 Å (11% for reflections with F > σ(F)). The crystal structure was determined at 4-Å resolution by molecular replacement methods using the program AMoRe (32Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) as described previously (8Chitarra V. Alzari P.M. Bentley G.A. Bhat T.N. Eisel J.-L. Houdusse A. Lescar J. Souchon H. Poljak R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7711-7715Google Scholar). The structures of unliganded GEL (28Lescar J. Souchon H. Alzari P.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 788-798Google Scholar), the variable dimer of Fab E225 (3Bentley G.A. Boulot G. Riottot M.-M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 254-257Google Scholar) and the constant dimer of Fab D1.3 (17Fischmann T.O. Bentley G.A. Bhat T.N. Boulot G. Mariuzza R.A. Phillips S.E.V. Tello D. Poljak R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12915-12920Google Scholar) were used as independent search models. Real space averaging between the two independent copies of the complex (SKEW) (6Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. 1976; 32: 832-846Google Scholar) significantly improved the quality of the density map, allowing the unambiguous tracing of all the CDRs that had been omitted from the initial models. Refinement was carried out with XPLOR (7Brnger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Google Scholar), and model rebuilding was carried out with the programs FRODO (22Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Google Scholar) and QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The crystallographic refinement converged to an R-factor of 19% for 23,703 observed intensities (F > 2σ(F)) to a 3-Å resolution. The present model consists of 1130 amino acid residues and does not include solvent molecules. The r.m.s. deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles are, respectively, 0.01 Å and 1.65°. The electron density of the protein backbone is clearly defined for the two independent complexes and unambiguous for all the CDRs in contact with lysozyme (Fig. 1a). The refined coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven, NY (4Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Simanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Google Scholar), code 1FBI. Total mRNA was purified from 2 × 106 hybridoma cells by the method of acid guanidium thiocyanate extraction (9Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). cDNA was produced from 5 mg of total RNA using Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technolgies, Inc.) and 25 pmol of immunoglobulin H or L chain constant region specific primers (21Huse W. Sastry D.L. Iverson S.A. Kang A.S. Alting-Mees M. Barton D.R. Benkovic S.J. Lerner R. Science. 1989; 246: 1275-1281Google Scholar). The cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the same 3’ primer and a combination of eight 5’ primers described by 21Huse W. Sastry D.L. Iverson S.A. Kang A.S. Alting-Mees M. Barton D.R. Benkovic S.J. Lerner R. Science. 1989; 246: 1275-1281Google Scholar, and the amplified products were cloned into polymerase chain reaction II plasmids (Invitrogen). Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sequenase Sequencing kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequencing was performed in both directions and confirmed by comparison of at least two clones obtained from separate polymerase chain reactions. The nucleotide sequences of the variable regions of the H and L chains have been deposited with GenBank (accession numbers U20819 and U20820). Sequencing of the first nine amino acids from the L chain was carried out by Edman degradation on a 470 Applied Biosystems sequencer. No sequence data could be obtained for the H chain presumably due to a blocked amino terminus. Sequences were analyzed using GCG software (16Devereux J. The GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package, Version 7.0. Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison WI1991: 53711Google Scholar). Numbering of the amino acid positions follows the convention of 23Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda1991Google Scholar. Electrostatic energy calculations were carried out as described by 34Pellegrini M. Doniach S. Proteins. 1993; 15: 436-444Google Scholar. A native-like conformation (within 3 Å, r.m.s.) was found to have the lowest electrostatic energy among several thousand conformations sampled during the docking search for the F9.13.7•GEL and HyHEL10•HEL complexes. The models of the chimeric low affinity complexes HyHEL10•JQL and F9.13.7•PHL were built by superimposing the crystallographic coordinates of the unliganded lysozyme (JQL, 20Houdusse A. Structure d'un Anticorps Anti-idiotype. 1992; (Ph.D. thesis, Universit Paris-Sud, France)Google Scholar; PHL, 28Lescar J. Souchon H. Alzari P.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 788-798Google Scholar) on the crystal structures of the complex. In all cases, a short relaxation stage (to avoid significant departure from experimental coordinates) was followed by a molecular dynamics simulation carried out at 300 K for 100 fs, extracting the binding energy per residue every 10 fs. Molecular surface areas were calculated using a modified version of the program MS (12Connolly M.L. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1983; 16: 548-558Google Scholar) with a probe radius of 1.7 Å and standard Van der Waals' radii for protein atoms. The atomic coordinates of the HyHEL10•HEL complex were taken from the Protein Data Bank, code 3HFM. The quaternary structure of the F9.13.7•GEL complex resembles that of other lysozyme-Fab complexes. mAb F9.13.7 binds lysozyme through a large contact surface formed by the CDRs at the amino-terminal end of the variable domain (see Fig. 5a). The two independent copies of the complex display systematic variations in overall temperature factors arising from a different packing environment (8Chitarra V. Alzari P.M. Bentley G.A. Bhat T.N. Eisel J.-L. Houdusse A. Lescar J. Souchon H. Poljak R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7711-7715Google Scholar). Their backbone structures, however, are closely similar. The overall r.m.s. deviation between all 552 equivalent Cα coordinates is 0.99 Å (0.62 Å excluding the constant (CH1 + CL) region). The two Fabs present the same extended conformation with an elbow bend between the variable and constant domains of 175° in both complexes. Complex formation induced only small conformational changes in the antigen polypeptide chain. Comparison of uncomplexed GEL determined at a 1.9-Å resolution (28Lescar J. Souchon H. Alzari P.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 788-798Google Scholar) with bound GEL gives r.m.s. deviations of 0.80 and 0.86 Å for corresponding main chain atoms, comparable with the differences observed between the two copies of lysozyme in the crystal structure of the complex (0.87 Å). The largest deviations (>1.4 Å) occur for a lysozyme loop (positions 100-104) at the periphery of the epitope. This loop, however, has no clear conformation in the structure of uncomplexed GEL (28Lescar J. Souchon H. Alzari P.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 788-798Google Scholar), and the observed differences likely reflect its intrinsic flexibility. Antigen-antibody contacts are extensive and involve many residues. The epitope is discontinuous, consisting of 13 exposed residues from a central α-helix (positions 88-99) and three surrounding loops (residues 15-21, 73-77, and 100-103). The area of lysozyme that is in contact with the antibody is 760 Å2. Twelve residues from the H chain and four from the L chain contribute to the binding of lysozyme (see Fig. 5a). This asymmetry is reflected by the buried surface areas upon complex formation (570 Å2 for the H chain and 200 Å2 for the L chain). Indeed, only two lysozyme residues (Arg-73, Asn-77) interact with the L1 and L3 hypervariable loops, whereas all other lysozyme residues contact residues from the H chain (see Fig. 6a). A large number of electrostatic interactions are observed at the interface. Three salt bridges and 12 hydrogen bonds are formed between antibody and lysozyme residues (Table 1). The majority of these polar contacts involve antibody residues from the H2 and H3 hypervariable regions.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The antibody F9.13.7 expresses a member of the VH124 variable, DFL16.1 diversity, and JH4 joining gene segment families in the H chain and Vκ10-Ars-A and Jκ2 in the L chain. Comparison with the germline sequences (Fig. 2) suggests that somatic mutations make a limited contribution to binding affinity. Five nucleotide differences are observed in each of the two variable segments. Four of these (at positions L23, L68, H50, and H63) are silent mutations, and three others (L38, L76, and H40) involve framework residues that do not contact the antigen. Two expressed mutations occurring in the H2 loop, Thr(H58) ⟶ Pro and Gln(H62) ⟶ Glu, affect positions that are not in contact with lysozyme. Furthermore, these substitutions do not affect the conformation of the loop compared with that of D11.15, another anti-lysozyme antibody that has the germline-encoded amino acids at these positions (Fig. 3). Indeed, the only change of somatic origin affecting a residue contacting lysozyme involves L chain Tyr(L92) (Asn in the Vκ10-Ars-A sequence), partially stacked against the δ-guanido group of Arg-73 (see Fig. 8a).Figure 3:a, α-carbon trace of the variable regions of D11.15 (left) bound to PHL (in red) and of F9.13.7 (right) bound to GEL (in yellow).

Capra J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1085-1089Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of VL F9.13.7 and the anti-arsonate R19.9 (25Lascombe M.-B. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nisonoff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9429-9433Google Scholar) differ at only five positions (Fig. 2), and the corresponding Cα coordinates can be superimposed with a r.m.s. deviation of 0.58 Å. In particular, the three hypervariable loops have the same conformation with only two amino acid substitutions in the L3 loop, reinforcing the concept that their H chain partners are the primary determinants of specificity (38Siekevitz M. Huang S. Gefter M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1983; 13: 123-132Google Scholar). The VH domain of F9.13.7 resembles that of anti-HEL antibody D11.15 (8Chitarra V. Alzari P.M. Bentley G.A. Bhat T.N. Eisel J.-L. Houdusse A. Lescar J. Souchon H. Poljak R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7711-7715Google Scholar). The H1 and H2 loops of these two antibodies are closely similar, although they contribute significantly (50% of the corresponding contact surfaces) to binding nonoverlapping regions of lysozyme (Fig. 3). This comparison illustrates how the same structural elements can confer binding specificity in quite different stereochemical environments. This lends further support to the canonical loop hypothesis (11Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Google Scholar), according to which a limited set of hypervariable loop conformations is sufficient to generate diversity. The long H3 loop (13 residues), which has the same conformation in the two noncrystallographically related complex molecules, partially protrudes into the active site cleft of lysozyme. Three consecutive Tyr residues encoded by the diversity gene segment are involved in stacking interactions with aromatic residues from neighboring CDRs (Fig. 1b); the next four residues, at the tip of H3, form a 310-helical turn that makes contact with lysozyme residues (in particular with Trp-63 on the enzyme active site), and the subsequent three amino acids adopt an extended conformation that connects back with the framework β-strand. The epitope of GEL defined by F9.13.7 extensively overlaps with that of the antibody HyHEL10 (11Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Google Scholar). The same 12 residues of the antigen (see Fig. 6) make 14 of the 15 intermolecular hydrogen bonds or salt links observed in each complex (Table 1). The surface areas buried upon Fab-lysozyme interaction are about the same for the two complexes (770 Å2 for the antibody and 760 Å2 for lysozyme). The overlap between the lysozyme epitopes bound by mAbs F9.13.7 and HyHEL10 can be numerically evaluated by plotting the surface lost by each lysozyme residue upon complex formation (Fig. 4). Despite binding a nearly identical epitope, the two antibodies have no sequence similarity at any of their CDRs (Fig. 2) and bind the epitope in different relative orientations (Fig. 5). A topographic correspondence can be established between the hypervariable loops L3 of F9.13.7 and H1 of HyHEL10, both of which interact with the same region of lysozyme (Fig. 6). In addition, the H3 loop of F9.13.7 fulfills an analogous role to that of H2 in HyHEL10, creating a protrusion that partially fits into the active site cleft of lysozyme (Fig. 1b and 5). On the opposite side of the epitope, H1 (F9.13.7) substitutes for L3 (HyHEL10), and extensive contacts made by the H2 region of F9.13.7 are made by L1 and L2 in the HyHEL10•HEL complex. The unusually short H3 loop of HyHEL10 contributes a single residue (Trp(H95)) to binding, as does the L1 loop of F9.13.7 (Tyr(L32)). Several intermolecular hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are observed in the two antigen-antibody interfaces. In general, the polar and charged groups are distributed in a similar fashion at the two antibody combining sites, clustered on a ridge approximately 10 Å from the geometric center of the antigen-binding region. Essentially the same epitope residues (which are identical between GEL and HEL) are involved in polar interactions with the antibody combining sites. A single salt bridge between Asp(H32) from the H chain and Lys-97 from lysozyme was found in the HyHEL10•HEL complex, despite the presence of several exposed charged residues (11Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Google Scholar). The situation is different for F9.13.7, since the H2 loop contains two germline-encoded Asp and one Glu that form ion pairs with basic residues of the epitope (Fig. 6a). Thus, Asp(H52) interacts with Lys-96, Asp(H54) with His-15, and Glu(H50) with Lys-97. The (Asp(H54)-His-15) salt bridge, however, is exposed to the solvent and could be weakened by hydration. The overall backbone structures of GEL bound to F9.13.7 and HEL bound to HyHEL10 are very similar despite the sequence differences between HEL and GEL (r.m.s. deviation of 0.89 Å for equivalent Cα positions), indicating that heterologous binding can be achieved with little conformational change in the lysozyme backbone. Complex formation, however, entails more significant differences in side chain conformations. The equivalent Cα atoms of the 12 lysozyme residues common to both epitopes can be superimposed with r.m.s. deviations of 0.8-0.9 Å, but these values rise to 1.5-1.6 Å when main chain and side chain atoms are included in the comparisons. The flexibility of side chains permits surface variations on lysozyme that match steric differences between the two antibody combining sites and allows for complementarity of the antigen-antibody interfaces. The association constant of F9.13.7 for HEL, as determined by microcalorimetric techniques, is 3.4 × 108M-1 (42Tello D. Goldbaum F.A. Mariuzza R.A. Ysern X. Schwarz F.P. Poljak R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 943-946Google Scholar). Cross-reactions of F9.13.7 with other avian lysozymes indicated that the relative affinity for GEL, bobwhite quail, and California quail lysozymes were similar to that for HEL, whereas much weaker or no reactions were observed for JQL, PHL, and turkey lysozymes (41Tello D. Spinelli S. Souchon H. Saul F.A. Riottot M.-M. Mariuzza R.A. Lascombe M.-B. Houdusse A. Eisele J.-L. Fischmann T. Chitarra V. Boulot G. Bhat T.N. Bentley G.A. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 507-512Google Scholar). The reduced affinity of antibodies F9.13.7 and D11.15 for JQL, which has two amino acid substitutions at positions 102 and 103 compared with HEL, has led to the assumption that this region could be bound by the two antibodies and that their epitopes could overlap. This hypothesis, however, is inconsistent with the formation of a ternary complex F9.13.7•HEL•D11.15, observed by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). In the crystal structures of the Fab D11.15•PHL (8Chitarra V. Alzari P.M. Bentley G.A. Bhat T.N. Eisel J.-L. Houdusse A. Lescar J. Souchon H. Poljak R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7711-7715Google Scholar) and the Fab F9.13.7•GEL complexes, residues from the lysozyme loop 100-103 interact with the two antibody combining sites, in agreement with the immunochemical mapping results. Nevertheless, simultaneous binding by the two antibodies is possible (Fig. 3) with only a minor conformational adjustment of the loop backbone needed to avoid steric clash. Despite binding a common set of residues, the F9.13.7 and HyHEL10 antibodies display a different pattern of fine specificity toward heterologous lysozymes. Both antibodies bind HEL and GEL with comparable affinities, but react differently with JQL and PHL. The F9.13.7•JQL and HyHEL10•PHL complexes have similar high affinities, whereas the association constant of the F9.13.7•PHL and HyHEL10•JQL complexes is significantly weaker (2Benjamin D.C. Berzofsky J.A. East I.J. Gurd F.R.N. Hannum C. Leach S.J. Margoliash E. Michael J.G. Miller A. Prager E.M. Reichlin M. Sercarz E.E. Smith-Gill S.J. Todd P.E. Wilson A.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 67-101Google Scholar; 41Tello D. Spinelli S. Souchon H. Saul F.A. Riottot M.-M. Mariuzza R.A. Lascombe M.-B. Houdusse A. Eisele J.-L. Fischmann T. Chitarra V. Boulot G. Bhat T.N. Bentley G.A. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 507-512Google Scholar). Thus, epitope mapping based on binding assays would point to different antigenic determinants (functional epitopes) on lysozyme, although the two antibodies recognize a very similar structural region, illustrating how different analytical approaches may lead to different perceptions of a protein epitope (44Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 266-272Google Scholar). Electrostatic model calculations carried out for the F9.13.7•GEL and HyHEL10•HEL complexes suggest that a few lysozyme residues, different for each antibody, contribute the most to binding. In the HyHEL10•HEL complex, three residues of the epitope (Arg-21, Lys-97, and Asp-101) account for half of the total average binding energy, in agreement with mutagenesis studies (24Kam-Morgan L.N.W. Smith-Gill S.J. Taylor M.G. Zhang L. Wilson A.C. Kirsch J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3958-3962Google Scholar), showing that substitutions of Arg-21 or Asp-101 significantly decrease the binding constant for HyHEL10. On the other hand, five residues (His-15, Arg-73, Lys-96, Lys-97, and Asp-101) contribute 80% of the F9.13.7•GEL binding energy. Leaving aside the expected contribution of amino acids involved in intermolecular salt bridges (His-15, Lys-96, and Lys-97), these results suggest that the arginine residues at positions 21 and 73 are important in accounting for the difference in antibody specificity. The side chain of Arg-73 protrudes toward the antibody combining site in both structures. In the F9.13.7•GEL complex, it is mostly occluded from the solvent by stacking interactions with Tyr(L92), which, together with Tyr(L32) and Leu(L94), form a ridge on the antibody surface (Fig. 7a). In contrast, the same arginine is largely exposed to the solvent in the HyHEL10•HEL interface (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, the planar ring of active site residue Trp-62 is oriented differently in the two bound lysozymes: perpendicular to the interface in the F9.13.7-GEL complex (where it is stacked against the Arg-73 side chain) and roughly parallel to the interface (and to the aromatic ring of Tyr(H53)) in the HyHEL10•HEL complex. The structural environment of Arg-73 is therefore consistent with the different binding constants of the antibodies for PHL and turkey lysozyme, for which two amino acid changes occur at the epitope with respect to HEL (His-15 ⟶ Met/Leu) and (Arg-73 ⟶ Lys). On the opposite side of the epitope, Arg-21 binds to a pocket formed by the H2 and L3 loops of HyHEL10 (Fig. 8b). The δ-guanido group of the arginine side chain is within hydrogen bonding distance of Tyr(H50), whereas its aliphatic moiety is partially screened from the solvent by the planar rings of Trp(L94) and Tyr(H58). The F9.13.7 combining site lacks a similar binding pocket; the Arg-21 side chain is in contact with the aromatic ring of Tyr(H32) but otherwise exposed to the solvent (Fig. 8a). The structural context around Arg-21 could account for the weak reaction of HyHEL10 with JQL, which has a glutamic acid at this position (24Kam-Morgan L.N.W. Smith-Gill S.J. Taylor M.G. Zhang L. Wilson A.C. Kirsch J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3958-3962Google Scholar). The same substitution would instead have a limited effect on F9.13.7 reactivity because of a stereochemically permissive environment. Two additional amino acid differences between HEL and JQL at positions close to the antigen-antibody interface, Gly-102 (HEL) ⟶ His (JQL) and Asn-103 (HEL) ⟶ His (JQL), appear to be less critical for binding, since replacements of Gly-102 have no effect on the affinity of HEL for HyHEL10 (24Kam-Morgan L.N.W. Smith-Gill S.J. Taylor M.G. Zhang L. Wilson A.C. Kirsch J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3958-3962Google Scholar). The F9.13.7-GEL complex shares common features with other antibody-antigen complexes whose structures have been reported. The molecular surfaces brought in contact upon complex formation are of comparable size, largely complementary in shape, and involve a similar number of contact residues and hydrogen bonds. The equilibrium association constant (Ka = 108M-1) is also typical of previously studied antigen-antibody complexes (Ka = 107-1010M-1). Comparative studies of known antibody structures have led 10Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Google Scholar to propose the existence of a small number of backbone conformations, or canonical structures, for five of the six hypervariable loops. The results presented in this paper further substantiate this hypothesis. Although the homologous H1 and H2 hypervariable loops of F9.13.7 and D11.15 have very similar conformations (Fig. 3b), they account for about half of the corresponding combining site surfaces and are engaged in interactions with quite different structural environments. This finding has interesting implications, not only for the modeling of antibody combining sites (11Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Google Scholar) but also for the molecular mechanisms that generate antibody diversity, since a limited set of main chain conformations for most hypervariable loops would ensure a potentially unlimited functional repertoire. Further evidence of heterologous binding is provided by the comparison of the F9.13.7•GEL and HyHEL10•HEL complexes. 12 out of 13 lysozyme residues in contact with the F9.13.7 combining site also interact with that of HyHEL10, despite the absence of amino acid sequence homology in the CDRs of the two antibodies. Other examples of unrelated proteins binding a same set of amino acid residues have been reported. 41Tello D. Spinelli S. Souchon H. Saul F.A. Riottot M.-M. Mariuzza R.A. Lascombe M.-B. Houdusse A. Eisele J.-L. Fischmann T. Chitarra V. Boulot G. Bhat T.N. Bentley G.A. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 507-512Google Scholar found that seven amino acid residues of anti-HEL antibody D1.3 are involved in interactions with both the antigen and an anti-idiotypic antibody, whereas the structure of the complex between the monomeric human growth hormone and its dimeric receptor (15de Vos A. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar) showed that the same set of residues on the two receptor monomers binds a different structure on the hormone. More recently, 30Malby R.L. Tulip W.R. Harley V.R. McKimm-Breschkin J.L. Laver W.G. Webster R.G. Colman P.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 733-746Google Scholar found that approximately 80% of the binding site of NC10 antibody on neuraminidase overlaps with that of the NC41 antibody and 5Braden B.C. Souchon H. Eisele J.-L. Bentley G.A. Bhat T.N. Navaza J. Poljak R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 767-781Google Scholar showed that mAbs D44.1 and HyHEL-5 bind a nearly identical epitope on lysozyme (in this case the H chains of the two mAbs result from the expression of the same VH gene although their H3 regions and L chains are unrelated, giving different combining sites and interactions with lysozyme). In none of these examples do cross-reacting molecular surfaces display obvious structural similarity. Previous studies of anti-idiotypic antibodies have suggested that in certain cases functional mimicry could be partially based on a true molecular mimicry (for review, see 40Taub R. Greene M.I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7431-7435Google Scholar and 31Mariuzza R.A. Poljak R.J. Curr. Opinion Immunol. 1993; 5: 50-55Google Scholar), the most plausible example being provided by a crystallographic study of anti-angiotensin II antibodies (18Garcia K.C. Ronco P.M. Verroust P.J. Brnger A.T. Amzel L.M. Science. 1992; 257: 502-507Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that functional mimicry by the two antibodies is possible even in the absence of any sequence similarity in their combining sites. Since antigen selection operates on functional, not structural, conformations, the known difficulties encountered in evidencing antibody mimics (see, for example, 14Davis S. Schockmel G. Somoza C. Buck D. Healey D. Rieber E. Reiter C. Williams A. Nature. 1992; 358: 76-79Google Scholar) suggest that heterologous binding by unrelated molecular surfaces may be a common phenomenon in antigen-antibody interactions. This is in agreement with the known degeneracy of immune responses and germline gene information to provide complementary structures that bind specifically to an antigenic determinant. Comparison of the F9.13.7- and HyHEL10-bound lysozymes provides an estimate of the extent to which conformational changes are involved in producing the observed complementarity of the antigen-antibody interfaces. The plasticity of the epitope contributes to restore steric complementarity to differently shaped combining sites. Indeed, molecular surface adaptability appears to be a general principle underlying promiscuity in protein-protein interactions (30Malby R.L. Tulip W.R. Harley V.R. McKimm-Breschkin J.L. Laver W.G. Webster R.G. Colman P.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 733-746Google Scholar). In the case of lysozyme, these changes arise primarily from side chain mobility and are not significantly reflected at the backbone level. This example and other recent studies of antigen-antibody interactions (for review, see 13Davies D.R. Padlan E.A. Curr. Opinion Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 254-256Google Scholar and 45Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 113-118Google Scholar) underline the role of conformational changes in immune recognition and may have important implications for theoretical approaches to modeling protein-protein interactions.

Affinity ligands that form covalent bonds with receptors have been very useful in the elucidation of receptor structure. Specific incorporation of radiolabeled affinity ligand into the receptor followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography or autoradiography has been used to identify the receptor, to determine the molecular mass of the receptor without purification, and to examine the nature of carbohydrate moieties (see, for example, (9Liu-Chen L.-Y. Chen C. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 749-756Google Scholar)). Because of the covalent nature of the bond between the ligand and the receptor, the site of incorporation, thus part of the binding domain, can be precisely determined by peptide mapping and/or determination of amino acid sequences of labeled fragments. For example, [3H]SKF 102,229 labeled adrenergic receptor α2 as a glycoprotein with a mass of 64 kDa(10Regan J.W. Raymond J.R. Lefkowitz R.J. DeMarinis R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 606-613Google Scholar). By peptide mapping of [3H]SKF 102,229 (antagonist)-labeled and [3H]azidoclonidine (agonist)-labeled α2-adrenergic receptors, Matsui et al.(11Matsui H. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Regan J.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4125-4130Google Scholar) identified the fourth TMH to be the region that formed covalent bonds with these ligands and, thus, to be part of the binding domain. β-Funaltrexamine (β-FNA), synthesized by Portoghese et al.(12Portoghese P.S. Larson D.L. Sayre L.M. Fries D.S. Takemori A.E. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 233-234Google Scholar), was shown to have reversible κ agonist and irreversible μ antagonist activities (for a review, see (13Takemori A.E. Portoghese P.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 193-223Google Scholar)). The high selectivity and irreversible nature of its action on μ opioid receptors makes β-FNA a very useful pharmacological tool both in vivo and in vitro. Binding of β-FNA to opioid receptors in tissue membrane preparations in vitro has also been characterized(14Tam S.W. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 351-357Google Scholar, 15Recht L.D. Pasternak G.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 140: 209-214Google Scholar, 16Rothman R.B. Long J.B. Bykov V. Jacobson A.E. Rice K.C. Holaday J.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 247: 405-416Google Scholar, 17Franklin T.G. Traynor J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 102: 718-722Google Scholar). β-FNA binds to μ, κ, and δ receptors with IC50 values of 2.2, 14, and 78 nM, respectively(14Tam S.W. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 351-357Google Scholar). There is a general agreement that β-FNA binds reversibly, and not irreversibly, to κ opioid receptors. β-FNA binds irreversibly to μ opioid receptors (14Tam S.W. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 351-357Google Scholar, 15Recht L.D. Pasternak G.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 140: 209-214Google Scholar) and at low concentrations (1-10 nM) [3H]β-FNA covalently labels only μ opioid binding sites with high specificity(18Liu-Chen L.-Y. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 321-329Google Scholar, 19Liu-Chen L.-Y. Li S. Tallarida R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 243-251Google Scholar, 20Liu-Chen L.-Y. Li S. Lewis M.E. Brain Res. 1991; 544: 235-242Google Scholar). In addition, at concentrations≥18 nM, β-FNA also binds irreversibly to δ receptors(14Tam S.W. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 351-357Google Scholar). [3H]β-FNA-labeled μ opioid receptors in the rat brain have broad molecular mass ranges from 60-75 kDa (median: 67 kDa)(9Liu-Chen L.-Y. Chen C. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 749-756Google Scholar), indicative of glycoprotein nature. Upon deglycosylation by N-glycanase®, labeled rat μ receptors became a sharp band of 39 kDa(9Liu-Chen L.-Y. Chen C. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 749-756Google Scholar). Chimeric receptors of closely related receptors have been very useful in the delineation of ligand binding domains of receptors. By examining the binding characteristics of μ/κ chimeric receptors, we (21Xue J.-C. Chen C. Zhu J. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Yu L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30195-30199Google Scholar) and Wang et al.(22Wang J.B. Johnson P.S. Wu J.M. Wang W.F. Uhl G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25966-25969Google Scholar) demonstrated that the second extracellular loop of the κ receptor was essential for the high affinity binding of dynorphin family peptides. In addition, we found that the TMHs 6 and 7 and the third extracellular (e3) loop of the κ receptor was critical for the binding of the selective antagonist norbinaltorphimine(21Xue J.-C. Chen C. Zhu J. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Yu L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30195-30199Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrated that the TMHs 6 and 7 and the e3 loop of the μ receptor is important for binding of selective agonists(23Xue J.-C. Chen C. Zhu J. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Yu L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12977-12979Google Scholar). Kong et al.(24Kong H. Raynor K. Yano H. Takeda J. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8042-8046Google Scholar) examined the binding characteristics of δ/κ chimeric receptors and found that the binding domain of κ selective antagonists was located in the N-terminal domain. Onogi et al.(25Onogi T. Minami M. Katao Y. Nakagawa T. Aoki Y. Toya T. Katsumata S. Satoh M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 93-97Google Scholar) reported that the determinant of selectivity of the μ receptor for Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-NMePhe-Gly-ol was located in the first extracellular loop, based on analysis of binding of [3H]Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-NMePhe-Gly-ol to a series of chimeric μ/δ opioid receptors β-FNA has been shown to bind irreversibly to both μ1 and μ2 receptors in brain membranes(15Recht L.D. Pasternak G.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 140: 209-214Google Scholar). Recent cloning of the μ opioid receptor makes it possible to study the interaction of β-FNA with one single type of μ receptors at the molecular level. In this study, we examined the binding of [3H]β-FNA to the cloned rat μ opioid receptor (RMOR) (2Chen Y. Mestek A. Liu J. Hurley J.A. Yu L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 8-12Google Scholar), as compared to native receptors in the rat brain. In addition, we also determined the region in the μ receptor that conferred selectivity for covalent binding of β-FNA. For this purpose, we examined binding of β-FNA to chimeric μ/κ receptors constructed from cloned rat μ and κ opioid receptors(2Chen Y. Mestek A. Liu J. Hurley J.A. Yu L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 8-12Google Scholar, 26Li S. Zhu J. Chen C. Chen Y.-W. de Riel J.K. Ashby B. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 629-633Google Scholar), since the RMOR does, yet the rat κ receptor (RKOR) does not, form a covalent bond with [3H]β-FNA. Rat μ and κ receptors and chimeras were transfected into COS-1 cells with DEAE-dextran-chloroquine method and membranes of COS cells transfected with RMOR (COS-RMOR) were prepared for binding as described(21Xue J.-C. Chen C. Zhu J. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Yu L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30195-30199Google Scholar, 26Li S. Zhu J. Chen C. Chen Y.-W. de Riel J.K. Ashby B. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 629-633Google Scholar). RMOR is in the vector pRc/CMV, which contains a neomycin-resistant gene. Transfection of CHO cells with RMOR was performed with 30 μl of Lipofectin® (1 mg/ml) and 10 μg of DNA/100-mm dish according to Felgner et al.(27Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Google Scholar). After transfection and 48-60 h in the growth medium, cells were subcultured at the ratio of 1:5 into the growth medium containing Geneticin (0.5 mg/ml) for 4 weeks for selection of cells expressing the neomycin-resistant gene. Clonal cells were grown in 24-well plates, and [3H]diprenorphine binding was performed on cells adhering to wells(28Toll L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 260: 9-15Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing the rat μ opioid receptor (CHO-RMOR) were maintained in medium containing Geneticin (0.2 mg/ml) and membranes prepared for binding(26Li S. Zhu J. Chen C. Chen Y.-W. de Riel J.K. Ashby B. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 629-633Google Scholar). Brain membranes of Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared as described(18Liu-Chen L.-Y. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 321-329Google Scholar). Binding experiments were performed in the presence of 100 mM NaCl with [3H]diprenorphine at a concentration close to its Kd for each receptor and 9 concentrations of β-FNA at room temperature for 60 min as described previously(26Li S. Zhu J. Chen C. Chen Y.-W. de Riel J.K. Ashby B. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 629-633Google Scholar). Membranes suspended in 50 mM TEL buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, 1 mM EGTA, 10 μM leupeptin) were incubated with [3H]β-FNA at specified concentrations in the presence of indicated concentrations of NaCl at 37°C for specified periods of time. Each assay tube contained 20-50 μg of membrane proteins. Nonspecific labeling was performed in the presence of 10 μM naloxone. Selective drugs were added at various concentrations for characterization on inhibition of irreversible binding. Irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA in labeled membranes was assayed according to our published method(9Liu-Chen L.-Y. Chen C. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 749-756Google Scholar, 19Liu-Chen L.-Y. Li S. Tallarida R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 243-251Google Scholar). Labeled membranes were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, filtered over GF/B filters, and radioactivity on the filter determined. Both solubilization and WGL affinity chromatography were carried at 4°C according to our published procedure(9Liu-Chen L.-Y. Chen C. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 749-756Google Scholar). Solubilization was carried out with 2% Nonidet P-40 instead of 2% Triton X-100. N-Glycanase treatment was conducted as described previously(9Liu-Chen L.-Y. Chen C. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 749-756Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and fluorography was performed as described previously (9Liu-Chen L.-Y. Chen C. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 749-756Google Scholar) with 14C-labeled protein molecular mass standards. Four chimeric μ/κ receptors (III, IV, XI, and XII) constructed in the vector pcDNA3 or pBK-CMV from RMOR and RKOR were used in this study. Chimera III (amino acids κ1-141/μ151-398) and chimera IV (amino acids μ1-150/κ142-380) were constructed by swapping the regions from the N terminus to the start of the TMH 3. Chimera XI (amino acids μ1-268/κ263-380) and chimera XII (amino acids κ1-262/μ269-398) were generated by exchanging the regions from the middle of the third intracellular (i3) loop to the C terminus. Details of generation of these chimeras were described previously(21Xue J.-C. Chen C. Zhu J. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Yu L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30195-30199Google Scholar). Protein contents of membranes and solubilized preparations were determined by the BCA method of Smith et al.(29Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. [3H]β-FNA (15.6 Ci/mmol) was supplied by National Institute on Drug Abuse. [3H]diprenorphine (35 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. Naloxone and U50,488H were generously provided by DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. and Upjohn, respectively. CTAP and ICI174,584 were purchased from Chiron Co. (San Diego, CA). WGL-Sepharose 6MB and DEAE-dextran were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; peptide-N4[N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl]asparagine amidase (EC 3.5.1.52) (from Flavobacterium meningosepticum) (N-glycanase®) from Genzyme Co. (Boston, MA); Lipofectin® reagent and 14C-labeled standards from Life Technologies, Inc. β-FNA inhibited 0.4 nM [3H]diprenorphine binding to the μ receptor expressed in COS-1 cells with high affinity. The IC50 value was calculated to be 1.7 ± 0.2 nM (n = 3) after a 60-min incubation at 25°C. Membranes of COS-RMOR cells were incubated with 4 nM [3H]β-FNA in the presence of 100 mM NaCl at 37°C for various periods of time. The nonspecific binding increased very slowly with time, whereas the specific irreversible binding increased rapidly with time and approached a plateau at 100-120 min (Fig. 1). Membranes of COS-RMOR cells were incubated in the presence of 100 mM NaCl at 37°C for 75 min with various concentrations of [3H]β-FNA. While the nonspecific binding increased with [3H]β-FNA concentration, the specific irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA reached a plateau at 3 nM (Fig. 4, RMOR). Untransfected COS-1 or CHO cells showed no specific irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA. NaCl greatly enhanced the specific irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA to the μ opioid receptor with the maximal effect at 200 mM. When compared to the level of specific binding in the presence of 100 mM NaCl (designated as 100%), those in the presence of various NaCl concentrations were as follows: no NaCl, 35.1%; 50 mM, 81.4%; 200 mM, 113.8%; 300 mM, 110.6% (mean of two experiments). Specific irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA to RMOR expressed in COS-1 cells was potently inhibited by CTAP (a selective μ ligand), but not by U50,488H (a κ ligand) and ICI174,864 (a δ ligand). The IC50 of CTAP was approximately 70 nM. It should be noted that the IC50 value of CTAP, a reversible ligand, in inhibiting the irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA does not represent its true affinity. In contrast, neither ICI174,864 nor U50,488H at 10 μM inhibited [3H]β-FNA irreversible binding at all. As shown in Fig. 2, [3H]β-FNA specifically labeled one band with a mass of 70-89 kDa (median: 80 kDa) in WGL-purified COS-RMOR preparation, one band with mass of 70-89 kDa (median: 80 kDa) in CHO-RMOR membranes, and one band with mass of 61-78 kDa (median: 67 kDa) in the WGL-purified rat brain preparation. Naloxone inhibited the labeling of the 80-kDa protein bands. We have shown previously that in the WGL-purified rat brain preparation, there is only one labeled band of 67 kDa, of which labeling is greatly reduced by naloxone(9Liu-Chen L.-Y. Chen C. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 749-756Google Scholar). All these three bands were broad and diffuse, indicating that labeled receptors are glycoproteins. Membranes of COS-1 cells transfected with the vector pcDNA3 alone did not show any labeled protein band (not shown). After deglycosylation with N-glycanase™174; to remove Asn-linked carbohydrates, both the 80-kDa protein band in the CHO-RMOR membranes and the 67-kDa band in the rat brain preparation became sharp bands of ~40 kDa (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the difference in the molecular mass of cloned receptors and native receptors reflects differences in the extent of glycosylation. We have previously shown that chimeras III, IV, XI, and XII bound [3H]diprenorphine with high affinity, with Kd values of 0.30, 0.78, 0.49, and 0.14 nM, respectively(21Xue J.-C. Chen C. Zhu J. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Yu L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30195-30199Google Scholar). These values are similar to Kd values of μ and κ receptors (0.35 and 0.26 nM, respectively)(21Xue J.-C. Chen C. Zhu J. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Yu L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30195-30199Google Scholar). β-FNA inhibited [3H]diprenorphine binding to all four chimeras with high affinity with IC50 values of 1.7, 12.5, 3.0, 13.8, 5.5, and 3.5 nM for μ, κ, III, IV, XI, and XII respectively (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Irreversible binding of a range of concentrations of [3H]β-FNA was carried out (Fig. 4). [3H]β-FNA bound irreversibly to RMOR, but not RKOR. While chimeras III showed high [3H]β-FNA specific irreversible binding, similar to RMOR, [3H]β-FNA did not bind irreversibly to chimeras IV (Fig. 4). Thus, the region from the TMH 3 to the C terminus of the μ receptor is necessary for irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA. To further narrow down the region, we examined irreversible binding to chimeras XI and XII. XII, constructed by substitution of the portion from the middle of i3 loop to the C terminus of RKOR with that of RMOR, acquired high [3H]β-FNA specific irreversible binding, similar to RMOR (Fig. 4). On the other hand, XI, constructed by replacement of the portion from the middle of i3 loop to the C terminus of RMOR with that of RKOR, did not display any [3H]β-FNA specific irreversible binding (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the region from the middle of the i3 loop to the C terminus is essential for irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA. Chimeras IV and XI were expressed at lower levels in COS-1 cells than RKOR, RMOR, chimeras III and XII, in terms of fmol/mg of membrane protein(21Xue J.-C. Chen C. Zhu J. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Yu L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30195-30199Google Scholar). In experiments shown in Fig. 4, receptor concentrations were adjusted to similar levels for all receptors (50-60 fmol/ml/tube). Therefore, the amount of protein in the assay was different among these receptors, which accounted for different levels of nonspecific binding of each receptor. Expression levels of a given receptor from different transfection experiments were remarkably similar(21Xue J.-C. Chen C. Zhu J. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Yu L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30195-30199Google Scholar). Thus, the variations between experiments were small. In this study, we demonstrated that the cloned rat μ opioid receptor bound β-FNA with a high affinity and could be specifically and irreversibly labeled by [3H]β-FNA under defined conditions. [3H]β-FNA-labeled receptors in COS-1 or CHO cells appeared as one diffuse broad band of 80 kDa, as compared to 67 kDa of the μ receptor in the rat brain. Upon deglycosylation, labeled receptors became much sharper bands with similar Mr values of ~40 kDa. By examining irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA to four chimeric μ/κ receptors, we demonstrated that the portion from the middle of the i3 loop to the C terminus of the μ receptor was important for covalent binding of [3H]β-FNA. At 37°C, the irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA to the cloned μ receptor was time- and [3H]β-FNA concentration-dependent, reaching a plateau at 3 nM and 100-120 min. The presence of Na+ was essential for high level of [3H]β-FNA irreversible binding to the μ receptor. CTAP potently inhibited irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA, whereas ICI174,584 and U50,488H did not. These results are consistent with our previous observation that [3H]β-FNA binds irreversibly to the μ receptor in brain membranes(9Liu-Chen L.-Y. Chen C. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 749-756Google Scholar, 18Liu-Chen L.-Y. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 321-329Google Scholar, 19Liu-Chen L.-Y. Li S. Tallarida R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 243-251Google Scholar, 20Liu-Chen L.-Y. Li S. Lewis M.E. Brain Res. 1991; 544: 235-242Google Scholar). It has been thought that β-FNA reacts with a Cys residue in the vicinity of the binding site of μ receptors to form a covalent bond(12Portoghese P.S. Larson D.L. Sayre L.M. Fries D.S. Takemori A.E. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 233-234Google Scholar, 14Tam S.W. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 351-357Google Scholar). The μ receptors in brain membranes contain the complex type of carbohydrates linked to the Asn residue of the receptor(9Liu-Chen L.-Y. Chen C. Phillips C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 749-756Google Scholar). The cloned rat μ receptor contains five consensus Asn-linked glycosylation sites (2Chen Y. Mestek A. Liu J. Hurley J.A. Yu L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 8-12Google Scholar). Whether each Asn residue is glycosylated remains to be determined. The carbohydrate moiety comprises a high percentage of the μ receptor molecular mass. The exact function of the carbohydrate moiety is not known. Native μ receptors and cloned μ receptors expressed in COS-1 or CHO cells, although displaying different extents of glycosylation, exhibited very similar binding and signal transduction properties(2Chen Y. Mestek A. Liu J. Hurley J.A. Yu L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 8-12Google Scholar). These observations indicate that carbohydrate moieties are not important in binding or signal transduction. Similar conclusions were reached by Pasternak et al.(30Pasternak G.W. Snyder S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 183-193Google Scholar) and Law et al.(31Law P.-Y. Ungar H.G. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 9-17Google Scholar). Neuraminidase treatment did not affect opioid receptor binding (30Pasternak G.W. Snyder S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 183-193Google Scholar). Law et al.(31Law P.-Y. Ungar H.G. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 9-17Google Scholar) found that glycosylation plays an important role in the structural maturation and insertion into plasma membranes of δ opioid receptors in NG108-15 cells, but not for ligand binding or activation of the second messenger system. To our knowledge, no similar study on the μ receptor has been performed. Deglycosylated μ receptors have a molecular mass of ~40 kDa, which is smaller than the molecular mass of 44 kDa predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence(2Chen Y. Mestek A. Liu J. Hurley J.A. Yu L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 8-12Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. There may be other post-translational modifications of μ opioid receptor proteins, such as phosphorylation, palmitoylation, or isoprenylation, which affect mobility of labeled receptors in SDS-PAGE. Another possibility that cannot be entirely ruled out is that a part of the receptor molecule is particularly susceptible to protease activities. This part may be removed during the process of [3H]β-FNA labeling (37°C, 75 min) and/or N-glycanase® treatment (37°C, 6 h), even though protease inhibitors were present during these processes. Irreversible binding of [3H]β-FNA to chimeric μ/κ receptors was examined to define the structural basis of μ selectivity of β-FNA irreversible binding. All four chimeras bound [3H]diprenorphine with high affinity, similar to μ and κ receptors(21Xue J.-C. Chen C. Zhu J. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Yu L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30195-30199Google Scholar). Binding of [3H]diprenorphine to all chimeras was completely blocked by naloxone. These results indicate that these chimeras retain opioid receptor conformation to some extent. All four chimeras bound β-FNA with similar high affinities as μ andκ receptors, yet [3H]β-FNA bound irreversibly to chimeras III and XII, but not IV and XI. Thus, the inability of chimeras IV and XI and the κ receptors to bind β-FNA irreversibly is not due to their inability to bind β-FNA reversibly. These findings indicate that the region from the third i3 loop to the C terminus is necessary for covalent binding of [3H]β-FNA. Two possibilities may exist. First, the site of β-FNA covalent incorporation is within the region from the i3 loop to the C terminus. Amino acid sequences within the i3 loop, most of TMH 6 and TMH 7 are very similar between μ and κ receptors. The C-terminal domain of the μ receptor does not contribute to ligand binding(32Surratt C.K. Johnson P.S. Moriwaki A. Seidleck B.K. Blaschak C.J. Wang J.B. Uhl G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20548-20553Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence in and around the e3 loop of the μ receptor appears to confer selectivity for β-FNA irreversible binding. Second, chimeras III and XII assume favorable conformations for β-FNA to form covalent bonds with the receptors, whereas chimeras IV and XI do not. Preservation of opioid receptor conformation of the chimeras was confirmed by high affinity binding of diprenorphine, naloxone, and β-FNA. However, the possibilities cannot be excluded that there are potential local conformational changes in the binding pocket, or that there are alterations in direct interactions between the receptor and the ligand(33Ackers G.K. Smith F.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 597-629Google Scholar). We are currently conducting peptide mapping analysis of [3H]β-FNA-labeled receptor to determine the region of [3H]β-FNA incorporation. In conclusion, the cloned rat μ opioid receptor expressed in COS-1 or CHO cells could be specifically and covalently labeled by [3H]β-FNA. The labeled receptor appeared as one diffuse broad band of 80 kDa by SDS-PAGE and fluorography and upon deglycosylation, it became a sharp band of ~40 kDa. The region between the middle of the i3 loop to the C terminus in the μ receptor is necessary for covalent bond formation with [3H]β-FNA. We will determine the region and eventually the amino acid residue that forms covalent bond with [3H]β-FNA. Since [3H]β-FNA is a rigid molecule, the information will be very useful for computerized modeling of the μ receptor."

Over the catalytic domain NIM-1 is 75% identical to NIMA, but overall the identity drops to 52%. nim-1 was able to functionally complement nimA5 in A. nidulans. Mutational analysis of potential activating phosphorylation sites found in NIMA, NIM-1, and related protein kinases was performed on NIMA. Mutation of threonine 199 (conserved in all NIMA-related kinases) inhibited NIMA β-casein kinase activity and abolished its in vivo function. This site conforms to a minimal consensus phosphorylation site for NIMA (FXXT) and is analogous to the autophosphorylation site of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinases. However, mutation of a unique cysteine residue found only in the catalytic site of NIMA and NIM-1 had no effect on NIMA kinase activity or function. Three temperature-sensitive alleles of nimA that cause arrest in G2 were sequenced and shown to generate three different amino acid substitutions. None of the mutations prevented accumulation of NIMA protein during G2 arrest, but all prevented the p34cdc2/cyclin B-dependent phosphorylation of NIMA normally seen during mitotic initiation even though p34cdc2/cyclin B H1 kinase activity was fully activated.

Initiation and exit from mitosis in Aspergillus nidulans requires the activation and inactivation of two cell cycle-regulated protein kinases, both of which have maximal kinase activity during mitotic initiation and also require mitotic transition to down-regulate their elevated mitotic activities (27Osmani A.H. McGuire S.L. Osmani S.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 283-291Google Scholar, 28Osmani A.H. O'Donnell K. Pu R.T. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2669-2679Google Scholar, 29Osmani A.H. van Peij N. Mischke M.

One, the p34cdc2/cyclin B histone H1 kinase, is a universal regulator of mitosis in organisms ranging from fungi to humans, and much is known about its regulation through the cell cycle (7Draetta G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 378-383Google Scholar; 21Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Google Scholar; 20Norbury C. Nurse P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 441-470Google Scholar). The second kinase, called NIMA, has at present only been identified as a key component of mitotic regulation in A. nidulans (5Doonan J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 599-611Google Scholar). However, expression of A. nidulans nimA in fission yeast, Xenopus, and human cell lines (24O'Connell M.J. Norbury C. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4926-4937Google Scholar; 15Lu K.P. Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 81: 413-424Google Scholar) can induce mitotic events in these systems, and expression of a dominant negative version of nimA leads to an arrest of human cells in G2 (15Lu K.P. Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 81: 413-424Google Scholar). These data strongly indicate that NIMA is a universal component of cell cycle regulation, but until the current work no functional homolog had been identified. Temperature-sensitive mutations of nimA reversibly arrest cells in late G2 (22Oakley B.R. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1155-1158Google Scholar). At the G2 arrest point of nimA5 cells contain a stable interphase microtubule array and show no signs of chromatin condensation or spindle formation, as determined using either indirect immunofluorescence or electron microscopy (19Morris N.R. Genet. Res. 1976; 26: 237-254Google Scholar; 22Oakley B.R. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1155-1158Google Scholar; 2Bergen L.G. Upshall A. Morris N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 114-119Google Scholar; 30Osmani S.A. May G.S. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1495-1504Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, such arrested cells have activated p34cdc2 H1 kinase activity even though they are clearly arrested in G2 (27Osmani A.H. McGuire S.L. Osmani S.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 283-291Google Scholar). This suggests that NIMA could function either downstream or in parallel to p34cdc2 in order to promote mitosis. Evidence has recently accumulated suggesting that NIMA is activated and phosphorylated by p34cdc2/cyclin B during mitotic initiation (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of NIMA by p34cdc2/cyclin B is not required for a basal level of NIMA kinase activity but is required for the final mitotic activation of NIMA kinase. This interaction may play a role in coordinating the mitotic promoting activities of these two protein kinases (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar). NIMA protein also accumulates during G2, as does its kinase activity, but it is then inactivated during mitosis by proteolysis (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar). The degradation of mitotic NIMA is required for cells to exit from mitosis (34Pu R.T. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 995-1003Google Scholar). Several genes that encode protein kinases with significant similarity (>40% identity over the catalytic domain) to A. nidulans NIMA have been isolated from higher eukaryotes. These putative kinases have been termed nek for nimA related kinases or nrk, also for nimA related kinase, due to their protein sequence similarity to A. nidulans NIMA (13Letwin K. Mizzen L. Motro B. Ben-David Y. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3521-3531Google Scholar; 37Schultz S.J. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 821-830Google Scholar; 14Levedakou E.N. He M. Baptist E.W.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 1-11Google Scholar). A nimA-like gene has also been isolated from yeast (11Jones D.G.L. Rosamond J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 87-92Google Scholar; 1Barton A. Davies C. Hutchison III, C. Kaback D. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 137-140Google Scholar; 39Schweitzer B. Philippsen P. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 164-167Google Scholar), and two related genes have been isolated from Trypanosome (8Gale Jr., M. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 111-122Google Scholar). The role of the NIMA-related kinases in cell cycle regulation remains to be established, but mouse nek1 is highly expressed in germ line cells, suggesting a role in meiosis (13Letwin K. Mizzen L. Motro B. Ben-David Y. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3521-3531Google Scholar). In addition, the level of human Nek2 protein is regulated through the cell cycle, reaching a maximum during G2, which indicates that Nek2 may play a cell cycle-specific role in humans (38Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sutterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 1-11Google Scholar). The cell cycle variation in Nek2 protein level is similar to the fluctuations seen for NIMA protein during the cell cycle of A. nidulans (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar; 42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar). To help identify important functional features of NIMA and to determine the existence of functional homologs, a nimA-like gene from Neurospora crassa was isolated. We have carried out functional analysis of this gene and also defined important amino acid residues required for NIMA function by mutagenesis and sequencing of previously isolated temperature-sensitive alleles of nimA. Aspergillus strains used were R153 (wA3; pyroA4), SO6 (nimA5; wA2; pyrG89; cnxE16; choA1; yA2; chaA1), and SO23 (nimA1; wA2; nicB8 or A2; choA1). Growth conditions, media, and transformation were as described previously (19Morris N.R. Genet. Res. 1976; 26: 237-254Google Scholar; 30Osmani S.A. May G.S. Morris N.R. J.

Yanofsky C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2452-2461Google Scholar, 26Orbach M.J. Sachs M.S. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10981-10987Google Scholar) were obtained from the Fungal Genetic Stock Center (University of Kansas Medical Center). Restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI), and T4 DNA ligase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Universal primers for M13 mp18 and M13 mp19 and specific primers for N. crassa nim-1 were used for sequencing (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using Sequenase obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp. To generate overlapping clones for sequencing, nested deletion was performed using Cyclone I Biosystem from IBI (New Haven, CT). For nimA mutant allele sequencing, two overlapping polymerase chain reaction fragments were amplified using genomic DNA as template isolated from wild type and the three nimA mutant strains. A 5’ polymerase chain reaction primer pair (5’-ACAATGGCAATCGCACTGGCG-3’ forward primer and 5’-GGCTACACGATCCTGAACCTCGCA-3’ reverse primer) and a 3’ polymerase chain reaction primer pair (5’-GGTAAAGGCAAGATTAGAGATCGAT-3’ forward primer and 5’-AAAGATGCAGCAGCGCAAGAAATG-3’ reverse primer) were used to amplify the overlapping fragments (5’ fragment = 1269 base pairs, 3’ fragment = 1297 base pairs). After 35-40 cycles of denaturing (94°C, 35 s), annealing (65°C, 55 s), and extension (72°C, 2 min), the double stranded DNA templates were purified with GeneClean II (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced completely on both stands with the Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Taq Dyedeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit, using a series of oligonucleotide primers. Sequencing reactions were purified by G50 Sephadex gel filtration equilibrated in deionized H2O and run on an Applied Biosystems 373A sequencer. For Southern blot analysis genomic DNAs were isolated and restricted by KpnI followed by electrophoresis and standard Southern blot procedures. Blots were probed with a 2.0-kb1 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PstI nimA fragment or a 2.4-kb nim-1 fragment labeled to equal specific activity. DNA sequence analysis and alignment were performed using GCG software (University of Wisconsin) and PC-Gene software (Intelligenetics Inc). In vitro mutagenesis was performed on plasmid pET21a-NIMA (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar) using a site-directed mutagenesis kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). After mutagenesis a BamHI fragment containing the mutation was used to replace the corresponding BamHI fragment of plasmid pAL5B (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar). Primers used were as follows: S198A, 5’-CACGACTTTGCGGCCACCTATGT-3’; T199A, 5’-ACTTTGCGTCCGCCTATGTCGGAACAC-3’; Y200A, 5’-GCGTCCACCGCTGTCGGAACACC-3’; and Y203A, 5’-CCACCTATGTCGGAGCACCATTCTACA-3’. For each mutagenesis the selection primer was 5’-AACAATTCCCCTCGAGAAATAATTTTG-3’, which destroys an XbaI site in pET21a-NIMA. kilobase(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein kinase assays and Western blot analysis were carried out as described previously (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar). pUCX7 contains a 3.2-kb XbaI genomic fragment of nim-1 cloned into the XbaI site of pUC18. To generate pUCX7-4, a 0.6-kb HindIII fragment from pUCX7-17 was removed before religation. Plasmid pUCX7-27 was generated by inserting the 2.4-kb HindIII genomic fragment from pUC7-17 into pUCX7-4 in the reverse orientation. An N. crassa λ J1 genomic DNA library (25Orbach M.J. Porro E.B. Yanofsky C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2452-2461Google Scholar) was probed with nimA cDNA under low stringency conditions. DNA was isolated from purified clones, and the hybridizing restriction fragments were cloned into both M13 and pUC18. We attempted to isolate a full-length cDNA from two different cDNA libraries (26Orbach M.J. Sachs M.S. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10981-10987Google Scholar) but were unable to isolate a full-length cDNA. The longest cDNA isolated and the genomic clones were sequenced on both strands as depicted in Fig. 1a. Hypothetical translation identified a long open reading frame (Fig. 2) encoding a protein with high similarity to A. nidulans NIMA (32Osmani S.A. Pu R.T. Morris N.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 237-244Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The open reading frame was initiated from a methionine codon in a good context to initiate translation and was preceded closely by stop codons in each reading frame (underlined in Fig. 2). To maintain the open reading frame we propose the presence of two introns as indicated in Fig. 2, the first being 107 and the second 52 bases in length. Both putative introns contained consensus splice sites, and one is positioned in exactly the same location as one of the two introns present in A. nidulans nimA (see below). We propose to call this locus nim-1 and designate the translation product NIM-1. By Northern blot analysis nim-1 mRNA was estimated to be 3.0 kb in length (data not shown).Figure 3:Kinase domain alignment of NIMA protein kinase family. The kinase domains of NIMA, NIM-1, Kin3, Nek1, Nek2, Stk2, and NrkA were aligned using GCG software. Positions with more than half-identical residues are shaded. The 11-kinase subdomains are marked with Roman numerals below the sequences. Kinase signature residues are indicated above the aligned sequences as are the amino acid substitutions of the three nimA mutant alleles, which are marked in lowercase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) NIM-1 contains 779 amino acids with a molecular weight of 86,056 and a pI of 10.8, similar to the values for NIMA (32Osmani S.A. Pu R.T. Morris N.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 237-244Google Scholar). Alignment of NIM-1 to NIMA shows both to contain the conserved features of protein kinases in their N termini (10Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar). Over the catalytic domain of 295 amino acids they have 75% identical residues, and over the first 500 amino acids 62% are identical and 90% similar. Overall the sequence identity of NIM-1 to NIMA is 52%, and overall similarity 64.8%. Like NIMA, the NIM-1 kinase domain contains a cysteine residue (amino acid 34) two positions upstream from the putative ATP interactive lysine, in contrast to other protein kinases, which generally have an alanine, and occasionally a valine or an isoleucine, at this position (Fig. 3). The NIMA-related kinases all have an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal extension. However, unlike the majority of other kinases, NIMA has an insert of 22 amino acids in kinase domain VI, as does Kin3 and NIM-1. However, Kin3 also contains a second insert of 38 amino acids in this region that is absent in NIMA and NIM-1 and most other protein kinases. NIM-1 is thus overall most similar to NIMA (Fig. 3). One feature found both in NIM-1 (starting at 306) and Nek2 (starting at 306) is a leucine zipper-like motif. This motif has been implicated in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (12Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Google Scholar). The significance of this motif in NIM-1 and Nek2 is at present unclear. To test the ability of nim-1 to functionally complement the nimA5 mutation of A. nidulans we transformed it into A. nidulans. Plasmid pUCX7-17 contains nim-1 as a 5.0-kb HindIII-XbaI fragment (Fig. 1b) in pUC18. This fragment contains the open reading frame encoding NIM-1 flanked 5’ and 3’ by about 1.6 and 1.0 kb, respectively. Two control plasmids were also constructed in the same vector (Fig. 1b). Strain SO6 (nimA5 and pyrG89) was transformed with a plasmid containing pyrG (23Oakley B.R. Rinehart J.E. Mitchell B.L. Oakley C.E. Carmona C. Gray G.L. May G.S. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 385-399Google Scholar) alone to complement the pyrG89 mutation or in combination with one of the plasmids described above. After limited growth at the permissive temperature on selective media one-half of the plates were shifted to the restrictive temperature of 42°C. After 2 days of growth (Fig. 1c) only transformants receiving both pyrG and pUCX7-17 were able to form colonies at 42°C. The control plasmids or pyrG alone allowed colony formation at 32°C but not at 42°C. Since one of the control plasmids contains the complete insert, with part being reversed, it indicates that the complementing activity resides in NIM-1 and not another protein encoded by the insert DNA of pUCX7-17. To address the issue of whether nim-1 could functionally complement nimA5 as a single copy gene, rather than as a high copy number suppressor, Southern blot analysis was carried out on DNA isolated from a wild type strain and five transformants co-transformed with pyrG and the full-length nim-1. Duplicate blots were hybridized with DNA probes labeled to an equal specific activity. With the A. nidulans nimA-specific probe all strains generated an equivalent signal, indicating equal loading and transfer to the blot (Fig. 4a). With the N. crassa nim-1 probe wild type DNA showed no hybridization under the high stringency conditions used. Based on the relative intensities of the signal produced, transformants 1, 2, 3, and 5 had a single copy of the N. crassa nim-1 integrated into their genome (Fig. 4a). To establish how well a single copy of N. crassa nim-1 could complement the nimA5 mutation in A. nidulans we grew strains at 32°C (permissive temperature), at 37°C (semi-restrictive temperature), and at 42°C (restrictive temperature). Colony diameters were measured for 5 days, and the final colonies were photographed (Fig. 4b). At 32°C no difference in growth rate could be detected among the control strain, the nimA5-containing strain, and a strain containing nimA5 and a single copy of nim-1. However at 37°C growth of the nimA5 strain was slightly inhibited, and the control strain and nimA5 + nim-1 strain grew at essentially the same rate. At 42°C the nimA5 strain was unable to form a colony, but the wild type and nimA5 strain containing nim-1 could both form a conidiating colony. These data indicate that a single copy of N. crassa nim-1 can complement the nimA5 mutation of A. nidulans for vegetative growth and conidia formation. Unlike all other kinases that we are aware of, both NIMA and NIM-1 have a cysteine −2 from the conserved lysine residue in the ATP binding pocket. This unusual conservation led us to ask if this specific residue (cysteine 38) is important to the function of NIMA in A. nidulans. Three forms of nimA were cloned into the A. nidulans expression vector pAL5 to put their expression under control of the alcA promoter (41Waring R.B. May G.S. Morris N.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 119-130Google Scholar; 6Doonan J.H. MacKintosh C. Osmani S. Cohen P. Bai G. Lee E.Y.C. Morris N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18889-18894Google Scholar; 42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar). These constructs were introduced into a nimA5-containing strain and tested for their ability to replace nimA5 function at the restrictive temperature (Table 1). Both the wild type and C38S versions of nimA were able to complement the nimA5 mutation at 42°C only when the alcA promoter was active due to growth on either glycerol (alcA noninduced nonrepressed) or ethanol (alcA induced). The kinase-negative version of nimA was unable to complement under identical conditions. These data indicate that cysteine 38 is not essential for NIMA function under these test conditions. A similar result was obtained when cysteine 38 was changed to an alanine, the most commonly found amino acid at this location in other protein kinases (data not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab At 32°C on alcA-inducing media (ethanol) several transformants were unable to form colonies (Table 1). For strains transformed with pAL5B1 and pAL5B1C38S this is most likely due to the presence of multiple copies of the plasmids, since we have previously shown that high expression levels of active NIMA causes premature mitotic induction (32Osmani S.A.

For the kinase-negative construct the inhibition of growth is caused by dominant negative effects as these cells arrest with nuclei in an interphase configuration (data not shown), a result also observed by 18Lu K.P. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6603-6607Google Scholar. To define the nimA1, nimA5, and nimA7 mutations at the DNA level we sequenced DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the mutants and a wild type strain. This analysis confirmed the previously published cDNA sequence of nimA (32Osmani S.A. Pu R.T. Morris N.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 237-244Google Scholar) and also identified two introns after positions 491 (64 base pairs) and 544 (53 base pairs). The first is in the same position as the first putative intron of nim-1. For each mutant allele we identified three different point mutations that generated a single amino acid substitution (Table 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Cells containing nimA1, nimA5, or nimA7 all arrest in G2 when grown or shifted to the restrictive temperature. Since the level of NIMA protein accumulates during G2 and is destroyed upon mitotic progression (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar; 42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar) we considered the possibility that the temperature-sensitive alleles of nimA could cause thermal instability. To test this hypothesis, we arrested cells in G2 by shifting them to the restrictive temperature (42°C). Cells were then released into mitosis by shifting to the permissive temperature. The mitotic index of the cultures and the level of NIMA protein and NIMA kinase activity were determined. Representative data for the nimA1 allele are shown in Fig. 5. One hour after the shift to the restrictive temperature the nimA1 strain had decreased NIMA kinase activity. The activity then recovered by 3 h to a level slightly higher than the preshift levels. Upon return to permissive temperature NIMA kinase activity increased, and cells entered mitosis synchronously. The kinase activity then decreased as cells completed mitosis (Fig. 5). The level of NIMA protein also showed dramatic changes in abundance and phosphorylation state during the transition through G2 and mitosis. At the G2 arrest point of nimA1 NIMA protein accumulated to high levels, but it was only partially active. Upon the return to permissive temperature NIMA protein was hyperphosphorylated, and its mobility decreased during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). As cells progressed through mitosis NIMA protein was proteolytically destroyed. Similar results were obtained using the nimA5 and nimA7 alleles (data not shown),2 2X. S. Ye and S. A. Osmani, manuscript in preparation. but these two mutations caused arrest in G2 with much reduced NIMA kinase activity, although all three mutations arrested in G2 with fully activated p34cdc2/cyclin B H1 kinase activity (Fig. 5 and data not shown). These data demonstrate that the temperature-sensitive alleles of nimA do not prevent accumulation of NIMA protein during G2. However, these alleles do prevent the hyperphosphorylation and full activation of NIMA that normally occurs during mitotic initiation. Several classes of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases, including cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (40Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Google Scholar), the cyclin-dependent protein kinases (3Booher R. Beach D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3523-3530Google Scholar), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (33Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.-H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Google Scholar), all require phosphorylation in a specific region of their catalytic domains to activate their protein kinase potential. This region, loop L12, which connects protein kinase domains VII and VIII (10Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar), contains several potential phosphorylation sites in NIMA, which are in positions analogous to the phosphorylation sites required for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, cyclin-dependent protein kinases, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (Fig. 6a). Interestingly, one particular site (Thr199 of NIMA) is conserved among all of the NIMA-related kinases, and phosphorylation of the analogous site in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is required for normal cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity. We therefore generated four mutant versions of NIMA in which one of the four potential phosphorylation sites was changed to an alanine (S198A, T199A, Y200A, and T203A). These constructs were then expressed in Escherichia coli, and equal amounts of NIMA protein were tested for β-casein kinase activity. Only the T199A mutant form of NIMA had greatly reduced β-casein kinase activity compared with either the wild type or the other mutant forms of NIMA (Fig. 6b). Thus threonine 199 of NIMA is a candidate phosphorylation site required for NIMA β-casein kinase activity. The T199A mutant form of NIMA was not completely inactive as a protein kinase, since it was able to undergo autophosphorylation, as could be observed in the kinase reactions to which β-casein was added (Fig. 6b). In addition, if a peptide substrate was used (16Lu K.P. Means A.R. EMBO. J. 1994; 13: 2103-2113Google Scholar), then significant kinase activity (30% of wild type) could be measured for the T199A form of NIMA. However, the activity of T199A NIMA was not improved by increasing the concentration of either β-casein or ATP. The K40M kinase-negative version of NIMA was still inactive as a kinase using the peptide as substrate, but the S198A and Y200A versions had similar activity to the wild type (data not shown). Since the T199A form of NIMA was not completely inactivated as a kinase we tested its ability to function in A. nidulans. An alcA promoter-driven form of the T199A mutant in the expression vector pAL5 (pAL5B1T199A) was introduced into a nimA5-containing strain and tested for its ability to replace nimA5 function at restrictive temperature. On alcA-inducing media at restrictive temperature no complementation of nimA5 was observed using the T199A construct although wild type alcA driven NIMA was able to complement (Table 1). Thus, Thr199 is not only important for NIMA β-casein kinase activity when expressed in E. coli, it is also essential for NIMA function in Aspergillus. We have isolated a functional homolog of the A. nidulans nimA cell cycle regulator from N. crassa called nim-1, the first such homolog isolated. Over the catalytic domain the two kinases are 75% identical, but their C-terminal extensions are much less similar. Because of the divergence between the nimA homologs from A. nidulans and N. crassa, which are both filamentous members of the Ascomycetes fungi, it is unlikely that higher eukaryotic functional homologs will have highly conserved C-terminal noncatalytic domains. However, there are important functional domains in the C terminus of NIMA, which is essential for function in A. nidulans (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar) and contains three putative bipartite nuclear localization motifs. This motif consists of two basic amino acids followed by a spacer region, which can vary from 10 to 37 amino acids in length, and ends with a cluster of five amino acids containing at least three basic residues (4Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar). The first such motif in NIMA starts at amino acid 299. A similar motif also occurs at a comparable position in NIM-1, but the second basic clusters do not align, since the NIM-1 spacer is composed of 19 amino acids and the NIMA spacer is composed of 11 amino acids. Nor do the other two nuclear localization motifs of NIMA align with comparable motifs in NIM-1. However, NIM-1 does contain another nuclear localization motif starting at amino acid 633 in a region that is very poorly conserved between the two kinases. Inspection of the other NIMA-related kinases identified at least one putative bipartite nuclear localization motif in Nek1, Nek2, and Stk2 but none in Kin3 or NrkA. This motif is thus common but not universal in the NIMA-related kinases. At present little data is available regarding the subcellular localization of any of these kinases, but given their overall basic nature and the existence of multiple bipartite nuclear localization signals in several of these kinases, a nuclear localization appears likely for at least NIMA, NIM-1, Nek2, Nek1, and Stk2. Indeed, it has recently been shown that NIMA expressed in HeLa cells does localize to the nucleus (15Lu K.P. Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 81: 413-424Google Scholar). Another intriguing motif found in the C terminus of NIMA are PEST sequences, which have been implicated in mediating rapid protein turnover, and such motifs are typically found in proteins that have very short half-lives (35Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Google Scholar). Two regions of NIMA gave a score of 12.6 (amino acids 406-437) and 16.4 (amino acids 502-524), and over comparable regions NIM-1 also scored high for PEST motifs, 5.3 (amino acids 393-444) and 11.0 (amino acids 522-543). This indicates that NIMA and NIM-1 may have short half-lives, and we know that removal of the PEST sequences from NIMA generates a very stable kinase that arrests cells in mitosis (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar) and that normally NIMA protein is proteolytically destroyed during mitotic transition (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar and Fig. 5). In light of the mitotic instability of NIMA it is intriguing that it contains a motif, RXXLXXXXN, in protein kinase subdomain III, which is similar to a mitotic cyclin destruction box (9Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Google Scholar). None of the other NIMA-related kinases match at all three conserved positions in this region, but human Nek2 does contain this motif starting at position amino acid 361 and is also degraded during the cell cycle (38Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sutterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 1-11Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of three different mutant alleles of nimA identified three amino acid substitutions that cause temperature sensitivity to NIMA, and each residue changed is in or near the protein kinase domain. nimA7 has glutamic acid 41 changed to a glycine, and the NIMA-related kinases NIM-1, Nek1, and Nek2 all contain a glutamic acid at the equivalent position. Lysine 40, which is adjacent to glutamic acid 41, has been implicated in ATP binding in protein kinases. This mutation may therefore interfere with the ability of NIMA to bind ATP correctly at the restrictive temperature. nimA5 changes tyrosine 91 to an asparagine, and NIM-1, Kin3, Nek1, and Nek2 also have a tyrosine at this position. This region is clearly conserved among the NIMA-like protein kinases, and it has been suggested that a conserved motif, based on this region of homology, may be a characteristic of NIMA-like protein kinases (38Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sutterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 1-11Google Scholar). The nimA1 mutation is located at the border of the kinase domain and changes leucine 304 to a proline. This mutation is the weakest of the three, and cells arrested at restrictive temperature containing this allele still retain some protein kinase activity. The three temperature-sensitive alleles of nimA arrested cells in G2 with elevated NIMA protein levels. These mutations do not therefore affect the expression of the mutant proteins but instead render them functionally inactive at restrictive temperature. The accumulated proteins were not hyperphosphorylated in G2 but were rapidly phosphorylated upon release into mitosis. This hyperphosphorylation is normally seen after activation of p34cdc2 during mitotic initiation (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar). Since each of the nimA alleles causes G2 arrest with fully activated p34cdc2/cyclin B H1 kinase activity it is unclear why NIMA is not hyperphosphorylated by p34cdc2/cyclin B at the G2 arrest point. One possibility is that at the G2 arrest points of nimA1, nimA5, and nimA7 the NIMA protein has not assumed a conformation that is a suitable substrate for p34cdc2/cyclin B. Upon release to permissive temperature, NIMA would be able to assume an active configuration and then become a substrate for p34cdc2/cyclin B. Alternatively, if NIMA and p34cdc2 are in different subcellular compartments prior to initiation of mitosis, activation of NIMA may allow the active p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase access to NIMA within the cell, which it could then phosphorylate. Comparison of published protein kinase sequences similar to NIMA and NIM-1 identified a conserved potential phosphorylation site (Thr199 in NIMA) analogous to the activating site autophosphorylated in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Mutation of Thr199 specifically affected NIMA kinase activity when expressed in E. coli, although other mutations in the same region had no effect. Thus, like cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, the NIMA family of protein kinases may require (auto?)phosphorylation at Thr199 for normal protein kinase activity. Although severely compromised as a β-casein kinase the T199A mutant still retained the ability to undergo autophosphorylation and partially retained the ability to phosphorylate a NIMA-specific peptide substrate. The equivalent mutant form of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (in which ThrT197 of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is also changed to an alanine) is also not completely inactive as a protein kinase but has greatly increased Km values for both the ATP and protein substrates (40Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Google Scholar). Thus mutation of this site in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and NIMA has similar effects on their kinase activities, since both kinases are compromised by this mutation but neither is completely inactivated by it. However, the T199A mutant form of NIMA, although still partially active as a protein kinase, was found to be functionally inactive, demonstrating the importance of this particular residue. If NIMA is normally activated by phosphorylation of Thr199, then NIMA is able to autophosphorylate at this position when expressed in E. coli. Thr199, and its equivalent in NIM-1, Kin3, and Nek2, is found within a region that corresponds to the NIMA phosphorylation consensus sequence FXXT (16Lu K.P. Means A.R. EMBO. J. 1994; 13: 2103-2113Google Scholar), further supporting the notion that NIMA autophosphorylates at this site. NIMA is known to undergo autophosphorylation on multiple sites when expressed in E. coli (17Lu K.P. Osmani S.A. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8769-8776Google Scholar), and mapping studies will have to be carried out to determine if NIMA does in fact phosphorylate Thr199 when expressed in E. coli. We know that NIMA is phosphorylated during G2 to yield an active protein kinase in A. nidulans and that it is then further phosphorylated during mitotic initiation after activation of the p34cdc2/cyclin B protein kinase (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar). As the nimA1, nimA5, and nimA7 alleles all arrest in G2 with elevated levels of NIMA protein, which is largely inactive, these mutations may prevent autophosphorylation of NIMA at threonine 199. Testing this possibility will require mapping of the phosphorylation sites of NIMA during cell cycle progression. This task is likely to be difficult since, based on molecular weight shifts seen during SDS-PAGE, the NIMA protein is phosphorylated at multiple sites during the cell cycle (42Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar). Several questions remain. Are any of the other NIMA-related protein kinases functional homologs of A. nidulans nimA? In addition, if Thr199 is phosphorylated in vivo, does the NIMA family of kinases require autophosphorylation of Thr199 for function, or is there a NIMA-activating kinase? We are most thankful to Liz Cigelnik for excellent technical assistance."

WT1 has a tightly restricted expression pattern; it is expressed during murine development within the mesonephric and metanephric kidneys, the lining of the heart, the mesothelial lining of the abdomen and thorax, and the spleen and testis(16Park S. Schalling M. Bernard A. Maheswaran S. Shipley G.C. Roberts D. Fletcher J. Shipman R. Rheinwald J. Demetri G. Griffin J. Minden M. Housman D.E. Haber D.A. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 415-420Google Scholar).

WT1 expression in Wilms' tumors is variable but correlates with histologic type(20Miwa H. Tomlinson G.E. Timmons C.F. Huff V. Cohn S.L. Strong L.C. Saunders G.F. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 181-187Google Scholar). Mesotheliomas often over-express WT1, with at least one mesothelioma containing a mutation in the WT1 gene that may be causative for the tumor(16Park S. Schalling M. Bernard A. Maheswaran S. Shipley G.C. Roberts D. Fletcher J. Shipman R. Rheinwald J. Demetri G. Griffin J. Minden M. Housman D.E. Haber D.A. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 415-420Google Scholar). We have searched for additional regulatory elements that modulate transcription from the promiscuous WT1 promoter. We have cloned two regions from the WT1 locus that are capable of altering transcription. In this process we found an upstream enhancer-like element (Fig. 1B) that enhanced transcription from the SV40 promoter but did not function with the WT1 promoter. At the same time we found a transcriptional silencer located within the third intron of WT1 (Fig. 1B) that represses transcription from both the WT1 and SV40 promoters and functions in a cell type-restricted fashion only repressing transcription in cell lines of non-renal origin. This silencer element contains a full-length Alu repeat. Alu repeats are members of the SINE (Short Interspersed Element) family of human repetitive DNA sequences(21Shen M.R. Batzer M.A. Deininger P.L. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 33: 311-320Google Scholar). Alu repeats are approximately 300 bp long and interspersed throughout the human genome with an average spacing of 5 kb. The number of Alu repeats is estimated at >500,000 copies in the haploid human genome(22Kariya Y. Kato K. Hayashizaki Y. Himeno S. Tarui S. Matsubara K. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 1-10Google Scholar). The function of Alu repeats is unclear(23Houck C.M. Rinehart F.P. Schmid C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 289-306Google Scholar), but they have been frequently identified in the transcriptional regulatory regions of a number of genes(24Maouche L. Carston J.P. Chretien S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 338-346Google Scholar). The 5′ enhancer fragment was generated by HindIII restriction digestion of the 3.1-kb XhoI genomic fragment cloned into pBlueScript, containing the 5′ terminus of the longest WT1 cDNA, LK15 (Fig. 1B). The 0.15-kb enhancer fragment was cloned into the HindIII site of the vector pCAT Promoter (Promega) and the clone pWT1pro-CAT. pWT1pro-CAT contains a 652-bp fragment of the WT1 promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene(14Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Google Scholar). The 0.91-kb silencer fragment was isolated from the cosmid cB5-2 by HindIII digestion and cloned into the same vectors as the enhancer fragment as well as the pBlueScript vector in both orientations. For deletion analysis, the 0.91-kb fragment in pBlueScript was digested with BglII and BamHI (contained within the vector) and inserted into pWT1pro-CAT. Using this method, we generated the 0.46-kb (5′Δ3S4) and 0.45-kb (3′Δ3S4) subclones. PCR amplification was used to amplify the 96- and 64-bp fragments of the 5′Δ3S4 silencer clone, and these fragments were cloned into the vector pWT1pro-CAT. The 96-bp element was generated by PCR amplification using the 0.91-kb silencer fragment as template with the primers BAM136 (GTGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAGGATT) and BGL136 (GAAGATCTGACTGGGGAAAGAAAAAGTTT). The 64-bp element was generated with the primers BAM74 (AAGGATCCGGCCCAGTCAGCAGGCACAA) and BGL74 (ACAGATCTAATCCAACAATGTCAGTCT). Clones were sequenced using Sequenase (United States Biochemical Corp.) by the didoxynucleotide method, as described by the manufacturer. All cell lines were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 environment. Cells were cultured in the medium specified containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection unless stated otherwise. HeLa cells, a human cervical carcinoma cell line (ATCC CCL2), 293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line transformed with adenovirus type 5 (ATCC CRL 1573), and G401 cells, a human rhabdoid tumor of the kidney cell line (ATCC CRL 1441) were maintained in minimal essential media. The K562 cell line, a chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis cell line (ATCC CCL 243) was maintained in RPMI. II-14 cells, a rat mesotheliomna cell line (25Walker C. Bermudez E. Stewart W. Bonner J. Molloy C.J. Everitt J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 301-306Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/F-12 supplemented with insulin, transferrin, selenium, and hydrocortisone. Transfections were performed by electroporation, and CAT assays were normalized with β-galactosidase as an internal control by the method described in Fraizer et al.(14Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Google Scholar), except that all cells were electroporated at 260 V, 960 microfarads in 200 μl of medium without serum(26Oka T. Rairkar A. Chen J.H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2077-2083Google Scholar). Relative activities reported are the average of three transfection experiments. In an effort to locate elements that regulate expression of WT1, we prepared subclones of HindIII fragments of the genomic cosmid cB5-2, which had previously been mapped (14Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Google Scholar) into CAT reporter constructs containing the SV40 promoter (pCAT promoter). These clones were initially screened in K562 cells, a chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis cell line, which expresses WT1 at high levels(4Call K.M. Glaser T. Ito C.Y. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Haber D.A. Rose E.A. Kral A. Yeger H. Lewis W.H. Jones C. Housman D.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 509-520Google Scholar). A 0.91-kb fragment located within the third intron of WT1 (Fig. 1B) repressed transcription from the SV40 promoter almost 4-fold (Fig. 2A). Silencer activity of the 0.91-kb fragment from the third intron of WT1 was tested with the SV40 promoter in 293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line that expresses endogenous WT1(4Call K.M. Glaser T. Ito C.Y. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Haber D.A. Rose E.A. Kral A. Yeger H. Lewis W.H. Jones C. Housman D.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 509-520Google Scholar), and G401 cells, a rhabdoid tumor of the kidney cell line(27Garvin A.J. Re G.G. Tarnowski B.I. Hazen-Martin D.J. Sens D.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 375-379Google Scholar). The silencer did not alter CAT expression from the SV40 promoter in either 293 or G401 cells (Fig. 2A). The silencer was also tested in HL60 cells, a promyelocytic leukemia cell line, and demonstrated the ability to repress transcription from the SV40 promoter 4-fold. To determine the ability of the silencer to repress transcription from the full-length 652-bp WT1 promoter, a CAT reporter vector containing both the WT1 promoter and the 0.91-kb silencer was assayed in K562, 293, and HeLa cells. The silencer repressed transcription from the WT1 promoter more than 5-fold in the K562 cells (Fig. 2, B and C) and more than 10-fold in HeLa cells but failed to repress transcription in the 293 cell line (Fig. 2B). The silencer fragment was tested alternatively in a 5′ position adjacent to the WT1 promoter or 3′, downstream of the CAT gene, and in its reverse orientation. It functioned equally well in all positions confirming the position and orientation independence of the silencer element. The silencer fragment was sequenced and found to include a full-length Alu repeat (Fig. 3). The 308-bp Alu sequence is in reverse orientation with respect to the WT1 gene, with the poly(A) tail (poly T within the sequence) at the 5′ end of the silencer region. The Alu repeat lacks the tandem repeats frequently found at the insertion sites of most Alu repeats(28Kariya Y. Kato K. Hayashizaki Y. Himeno Tarui S. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 1-10Google Scholar). The Alu sequence diverges from the consensus Alu sequence (28Kariya Y. Kato K. Hayashizaki Y. Himeno Tarui S. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 1-10Google Scholar) by 16.2%, whereas the average divergence of Alu sequences in the human genome is 16.12%, with a standard deviation of 5.63%(29Jurka J. Smith T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4775-4778Google Scholar). A search for potential transcription factor binding sites revealed several potential sites of interest (Fig. 3). A series of deletion constructs of the silencer fragment were made to define the essential silencer region. Initially the 0.91-kb silencer fragment was subdivided into two fragments (0.46 and 0.45 kb) by cleavage at an internal BglII restriction site. The presence of the internal BglII restriction enzyme site, flanked by the HindIII and MboI sites, confirmed that the 0.91-kb silencer fragment was in the third intron of WT1(30Tadokoro K. Oki N. Fujii H. Ohshima A. Inoue T. Yamada M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1992; 83: 1198-1203Google Scholar). Sequence analysis demonstrated the silencer element was located at the junction with the cosmid vector(14Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Google Scholar). The 0.46-kb 5′ fragment and a 0.45-kb 3′ fragment were cloned into a CAT reporter vector containing the 652-bp WT1 promoter. These regions were assayed for silencer activity in HeLa cells. The 5′ 0.46-kb fragment contained all the silencer activity, repressing transcription 10-fold, whereas the 3′ fragment had no effect on transcription from the WT1 promoter (Fig. 4). The 460-bp silencer fragment was also tested in K562 and 293 cells for silencing activity. In K562 cells, the silencer repressed transcription more than 10-fold, whereas in 293 cells, transcription from the WT1 promoter remained unaffected (1.15-fold of the WT1 promoter alone). In an effort to determine whether the silencer was species-specific, the 460-bp silencer element with the WT1 promoter construct was transfected into a rat mesotheliomna cell line, II-14. The silencer functioned to repress transcription from the WT1 promoter 10-fold in II-14 cells. To determine whether the silencer was able to repress the WT1 promoter in the presence of the 3′ hematopoietic specific enhancer, we tested a construct containing the 652-bp WT1 promoter with both the 460-bp silencer and the 1083-bp enhancer (14Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Google Scholar) in K562 cells. The silencer repressed transcription from the WT1 promoter more than 10-fold, nullifying the enhancer activity. In an effort to delineate the essential silencer region, two additional deletion constructs were made. PCR was used to generate both a 96-bp fragment containing the 5′ end of the 460-bp fragment and a 64-bp fragment containing the 3′ end of the 460-bp fragment. These PCR fragments were cloned into a construct containing the 652-bp WT1 promoter and assayed for silencer activity. The constructs excluded the Alu repeat and allowed analysis of the role the Alu sequence plays in silencer activity (Fig. 3). Neither the 3′ nor 5′ deletion constructs contained silencer activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 5), implying that some or all of the 300-bp Alu sequence is required for silencer activity or that the 3′- and 5′-flanking regions together function as a silencer. A subsequent screening for additional regulatory elements identified a transcriptional enhancer. A 0.15-kb XhoI-HindIII fragment located 5′ of LK15 (Fig. 1B) enhanced transcription from the SV40 promoter more than 7-fold in K562 cells (Fig. 5, A and C). To further characterize the 0.15-kb enhancer fragment, its activity was assayed in 293 cells. This fragment demonstrated greater than 3-fold enhancement of transcription from the SV40 promoter in the 293 cells (Fig. 5A). This fragment was then cloned into a vector containing the full-length 652-bp WT1 promoter linked to the CAT gene to test enhancer activity with the WT1 promoter. Transfection of this construct into either K562 or G401 cells failed to demonstrate enhancer activity from the 0.15-kb fragment using the WT1 promoter (Fig. 5B). The enhancer was tested with the full-length 652-bp WT1 promoter in 293 cells by calcium phosphate transfection (14Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Google Scholar) as well, and showed no enhancer activity (data not shown). The 0.15-kb enhancer was sequenced (Fig. 6) and found to be identical to a 148-bp region of the first intron of Wit1 (bases 2519-2666; GeneBank accession no. X69950)(31Gessler M. Bruns G.A.P. Genomics. 1993; 17: 499-501Google Scholar). A search for potential transcriptional factor binding sites revealed multiple potential sites of interest (Fig. 6). We have previously demonstrated that transcription from the WT1 promoter is promiscuous (14Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Google Scholar). In a search for tissue-specific regulatory elements involved in WT1 transcription, we cloned a silencer region from the third intron of WT1 at a distance of 12 kb downstream from the WT1 promoter. The silencer represses basal transcription from both the SV40 and WT1 promoters in constructs lacking enhancers, and the addition of the 3′ hematopoietic specific enhancer has no effect on silencer function in K562 cells. This silencer represses transcription in all cell lines of non-renal origin that we have tested including leukemic cells (K562 and HL60) and cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa). Interestingly, this silencer does not repress transcription in cells of renal origin (293 or G401). The silencer activity correlates with cell type origin and not with WT1 mRNA expression (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Although the silencer function in cells that express endogenous WT1, such as K562, HL60, and II-14 cells, expression probably results from alternative mechanisms of WT1 transcriptional activation that can override the silencer in these cell lines. Since the 3′ enhancer cannot activate WT1 transcription in either HL60 or II-14 cells, clearly other regulatory elements must be responsible for WT1 expression in these cells. It is possible that these other cis-acting elements which control WT1 expression in hematopoietic and mesothelial cells may under certain circumstances overcome the repression by the silencer element. Silencer deletion experiments indicate that an Alu repeat sequence is required for silencer activity or the silencer element is transected by an Alu repeat. Alu repeats have been associated with regulatory elements (in both silencers and enhancers) of a number of genes, including keratin 18(32Neznanov N.S. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1815-1823Google Scholar), erythropoietin(24Maouche L. Carston J.P. Chretien S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 338-346Google Scholar), CD8α(33Hambor J.E. Mennone J. Coon M.E. Hanke J.H. Kavathas P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7056-7070Google Scholar), θ-globin(34Kim J.-H. Yu C.-Y. Bailey A. Hardison R. Shen C.-K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5687-5700Google Scholar), and the γ chain Fc/T cell receptor (35Brini A.T. Lee G.M. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1355-1361Google Scholar) genes. The mechanisms by which Alu repeats are believed to modulate transcription are diverse. In some instances Alu repeat sequences mediate repression through transcriptional interference mechanisms, as demonstrated with ϵ-globin(36Wu J. Grindlay G.J. Bushel P. Mendelsohn L. Allan M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1209-1216Google Scholar). Transcriptional interference results from transcription initiated at an internal RNA polymerase III promoter that is contained in a subset of Alu sequences(36Wu J. Grindlay G.J. Bushel P. Mendelsohn L. Allan M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1209-1216Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the Alu repeat present within the 460-bp silencer region interferes with transcription of the WT1 mRNA, as the silencer functions in an orientation and position independent fashion. Transcriptional interference would require the silencer to be position dependent, generating transcripts that would read through the reporter gene. Neznanov et al. (32Neznanov N.S. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1815-1823Google Scholar) have postulated that Alu repeats can function as “insulators,” defining transcriptionally active domains, and they have tested this hypothesis in transgenic animals. They found that an Alu repeat was capable of repressing transcription from the keratin 18 promoter(37Neznanov N. Thorey I.S. Cecena G. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2214-2223Google Scholar). Other workers reported silencer activity in Alu repeats as a result of the interaction of Alu-binding proteins with the Alu repeat in a sequence-specific manner(38Perelygina L.M. Tomilin N.V. Podgornaya O.I. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 12: 111-116Google Scholar). Additionally, some reports have indicated that over time, the Alu repeat has evolved to “gain” function, that is, by the introduction of base substitutions within the Alu repeat, transcription factor-binding sites have been created, thus allowing Alu repeats to take on new roles as transcriptional enhancers or silencers(35Brini A.T. Lee G.M. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1355-1361Google Scholar). Given that the silencer functions in an orientation and position independent manner, with both the SV40 and WT1 promoter, in both human and rodent cells, it appears that this Alu repeat has gained silencer function rather than functioning by virtue of containing an Alu repeat. We have identified a 148-bp region that is capable of enhancing transcription from the SV40 promoter. This region was unable to increase transcription from the full-length 652-bp WT1 promoter. However, this does not preclude the possibility that the 148-bp fragment is a functional enhancer in other cell types or that other flanking sequences are required for enhancer function with the WT1 promoter. This enhancer lies within an intron of the Wit1 gene (31Gessler M. Bruns G.A.P. Genomics. 1993; 17: 499-501Google Scholar), a small gene whose transcription originates from the same region as WT1 in the opposite direction. Wit1 is not well characterized, with a very small open reading frame of 276 nucleotides which does not encode a known protein(39Huang A. Campbell C.E. Bonetta L. McAndrews-Hill M.S. Chilton-MacNeill S. Coppes M.J. Law D.J. Feinberg A.P. Yeger H. Williams B.R.G. Science. 1990; 250: 991-994Google Scholar). This enhancer fragment lies 877 bp from the closest Wit1 transcriptional start site (40Campbell C.E. Huang A. Gurney A.L. Kessler P.M. Hewitt J.A. Williams B.R.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 583-595Google Scholar) and perhaps may function as a enhancer for Wit1 transcription. Wit1 has also been demonstrated to initiate transcription from a second region within the first intron of WT1, generating an antisense transcript through exon 1 of WT1, but the start sites of this transcript remain unmapped(40Campbell C.E. Huang A. Gurney A.L. Kessler P.M. Hewitt J.A. Williams B.R.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 583-595Google Scholar). In summary, we have cloned a 460-bp silencer region that represses transcription from the WT1 promoter in a cell type-specific fashion. This silencer region requires some or all of an Alu repeat for activity. This silencer may be important in restricting WT1 expression to certain tissues during normal development.

Permeabilization of both of these insulinoma cell lines to botulinum neurotoxin A by electroporation resulted, after 3 days of culture, in the loss of ~90% of SNAP-25 immunoreactivity. A similar permeabilization of these cells with botulinum neurotoxin B resulted in the cleavage of ~90% of the synaptobrevin-like immunoreactivities. Botulinum neurotoxin F also cleaved ~90% of the synaptobrevin-like immunoreactivity in RINm5F cells. The permeabilization of both insulinoma cells to neurotoxin A resulted in a >90% inhibition of potassium-stimulated, calcium-dependent insulin release. By contrast, permeabilization of the insulinoma cell lines to neurotoxin B resulted in only a ~60% inhibition of potassium-stimulated insulin release in HIT-15 cells, and neither neurotoxin B nor F caused inhibition in RINm5F cells. Thus HIT-15 and RINm5F cells contain the components of the putative exocytotic docking complex described in cells derived from the neural crest. In HIT-15 cells both SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin appear to be involved in calcium-dependent insulin secretion, whereas in RINm5F cells SNAP-25 but not synaptobrevin is involved.

INTRODUCTIONThe clostridial neurotoxins, botulinum and tetanus, inhibit neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve endings (1Dolly J.O. Ashton A.C. Mcinnes C. Wadsworth J.D.F. Poulain B. Tauc L.

In most species both forms are substrates for BoNT/B; however, in the rat synaptobrevin 1 is not a substrate(10Elferink L.A. Trimble W.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

A homologue of synaptobrevin, cellubrevin, has been identified in non-neuronal cells and is a toxin substrate(11McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C.

When the uptake barrier is removed clostridial neurotoxins inhibit secretion from not only neuronal cells but also from PC12 (14McInnes C. Dolly J.O.

If these proteins are involved in Ca2+-dependent secretion from these cells, then their cleavage by botulinum toxins should inhibit Ca2+-dependent release of hormones or enzymes from pancreatic cells.

This antibody has been shown to recognize sequences common to both synaptobrevin I and II. The anti-syntaxin antibody, 10H5, was a gift from Prof. Takahashi (Mitsubishi Kasei Institute, Tokyo, Japan). HIT-15 and RINm5F cells were a gift from Dr. Irene Green (Sussex University, Brighton, UK). Electroporation cuvettes were from Bio-Rad. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and nitrocellulose were from R& Systems Europe Ltd. (Abingdon, UK). All other reagents and chemicals used in this study were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Ltd. (Fancy Road, Poole, UK).Cell CultureHIT-15 cells and RINm5F cells were cultured in 80-cm2 flasks in DMEM containing 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum (HIT-15 cells) or 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (RINm5F cells). Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.ElectroporationCells (HIT-15 or RINm5F) were selected when they were subconfluent and harvested using cell dissociation reagent (Sigma). After washing in phosphate-buffered saline the cells were resuspended in DMEM and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at a density of 2-5 million cells/ml, and 0.8 ml was added to each of a number of 0.4-cm electroporation cuvettes. Toxins were added as required, and the cells were then immediately electroporated at 960 microfarads and 0.28 kV using a Bio-Rad electroporator(21Bartels F. Bigalke H. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 302-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After electroporation the cells were washed three times in DMEM and bovine serum albumin by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min). The cells were then resuspended in the appropriate medium containing antibiotics and plated out at a density of 0.3-0.6 million cells/well in a 24-multiwell plate. The cells were cultured for 3 days at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.Cell Secretion ExperimentsAfter 3 days in culture the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of DMEM. Secretion of insulin was then assessed by incubation of the cells for 30 min at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 with 0.3 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer containing 129 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.0 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 2.8 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (27Komatsu M. McDermott A.M. Gillison S.L. Sharp G.W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23306-23927Google Scholar) or in HK-KRB in which KCl was increased to 30 mM and NaCl was reduced to 103.8 mM. In some experiments calcium was omitted from the KRB buffer, and EGTA was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, Ca2+-free KRB. At the end of the experimental incubation the supernatants were removed and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 4 min. The supernatants and cells were frozen at −80°C until analysis. Insulin was assayed using the Amersham International plc rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.Western Blot AnalysisHydrophobic proteins were extracted from the cells remaining after the secretion experiment by a modification of the method of Bordier(28Bordier C.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells in each well were treated with 0.5 ml of 0.2 M NaOH for 10 min at room temperature before being neutralized with 0.5 ml of 0.2 M HCl. The mixture was then cooled to 4°C, and 100 μl of Triton X-114 (10%, v/v) was added, mixed three times, and left for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting solution was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was incubated in a water bath at 37°C for 30 min until two distinct phases formed. After separation by centrifugation the upper phase was removed and the lower phase containing hydrophobic proteins was retained. The samples were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by precipitation with chloroform/methanol, and the precipitate was dissolved in 20 μl of sample buffer.The proteins were resolved on a 4-20% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with antibodies and the immunoreactivities visualized using chemiluminescent detection essentially as described previously(26Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3039-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar).Data was quantified from Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham International plc) using a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer, and the effect of any treatment was expressed as a percentage of the control value for each experiment. The results were within the linear range of the technique.RESULTSThe efficiency of electroporation was determined by the use of a fluorescein-dextran molecule of comparable molecular weight to the toxin molecule. Electroporation was found to permeabilize >95% of both the HIT-15 and RINm5F cells with only limited effects on cell viability and no significant difference between the basal levels of insulin release and protein in control and electroporated cells.Both HIT-15 and RINm5F cells were found to contain a SNAP-25-immunoreactive protein of Mr 30,000 as determined by two separate antibodies. Both insulinoma cells contained two synaptobrevin-immunoreactive proteins of Mr 16,000-17,000. The lower synaptobrevin immunoreactivity was less intense in both cell lines, and in the HIT-15 cells it was not always clearly visible. A protein of Mr 36,000 with syntaxin immunoreactivity was also detected in both cell lines (Fig. 1).Electroporation of the HIT-15 and RINm5F cells with BoNT/A (500 nM) resulted in a reduction of SNAP-25 immunoreactivity after 3 days of culture as assessed using the anti-peptide antibody (Fig. 1). In HIT-15 cells 6.4 ± 5.3% of the protein remained compared with control (n = 3), and in RINm5F cells 14.5 ± 13.5% of the protein remained compared with control (n = 3). Use of the monoclonal antibody, SMI 81, revealed a small shift in electrophoretic mobility to Mr 29,000; this is consistent with the known site of proteolysis of SNAP-25 by BoNT/A, which results in the loss of a 9-residue peptide from the C terminus of the protein(6Blasi J. Chapman R.C. Link E. Binz T. Yamasaki S. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. Jahn R. Nature. 1993; 365: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Electroporation of the HIT-15 and RINm5F cells with BoNT/B (500 nM) resulted in a reduction of both synaptobrevin-like immunoreactivities after 3 days of culture (Fig. 1). In HIT-15 cells 7.8 ± 2.9% of the protein remained compared with control (n = 3), and in RINm5F cells 12.3 ± 4.8% of the protein remained compared with control (n = 4).In Ca2+-containing KRB, high K+ treatment significantly stimulated insulin release from both the HIT-15 and RINm5F cells (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). High K+ did not stimulate insulin release from RINm5F cells in Ca2+-free KRB (94.8 ± 7% of basal release; means ± range of two determinations).After 3 days in culture following electroporation in the presence of BoNT/A (500 nM), high K+-stimulated insulin release from HIT-15 cells was reduced by 95.0% (p < 0.02; n = 4; Fig. 2). Basal or high K+-stimulated insulin release from HIT-15 cells was not significantly affected by electroporation per se. Electroporation of HIT-15 cells with heat-treated BoNT/A did not significantly affect high K+-stimulated insulin release (data not shown). After 3 days of culture following electroporation of BoNT/B (500 nM) into HIT-15 cells, high K+-stimulated insulin release was reduced by 63% (p < 0.05; n = 3). This partial inhibition of high K+-stimulated insulin release was not increased by electroporation of cells with higher levels of BoNT/B (2.5 μM; data not shown).Figure 2:The effect of botulinum toxins A and B on calcium-dependent insulin release from HIT-15 cells. HIT-15 cells were untreated (Con), electroporated (EP-Con), electroporated in the presence of 500 nM BoNT/A (EP-A), or electroporated in the presence of 500 nM BoNT/B (EP-B). The cells were subsequently cultured for 3 days. The release of insulin from the cells during a 30-min incubation period with 4.8 mM KCl-KRB (LK-KRB) or 30 mM KCl-KRB (HK-KRB) was determined by specific radioimmunoassay. The secretion data presented are the means ± S.E. of three experiments, each performed in duplicate; one star indicates p < 0.05 and two stars indicate p < 0.02 for differences from control, determined by a two-tailed, unpaired t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As with the HIT-15 cells, electroporation of RINm5F cells did not significantly affect subsequent basal or high K+-stimulated insulin release (Fig. 3). Electroporation of RINm5F cells with BoNT/A (500 nM) resulted, after 3 days in culture, in the inhibition of insulin release by 91.3% (p < 0.001; n = 5). However, after 3 days in culture following electroporation of the RINm5F cells with BoNT/B (500 nM), there was no significant block of high K+-stimulated insulin release nor did electroporation of the cells in the presence of a much higher concentration of BoNT/B (2.5 μM) have any effect (data not shown).Figure 3:The effect of botulinum toxins A and B on calcium-dependent release of insulin from RINm5F cells. RINm5F cells were untreated (Con), electroporated (Con-EP), electroporated in the presence of 500 nM BoNT/A (EP-A), electroporated in the presence of 500 nM BoNT/B (EP-B), or electroporated in the presence of 250 nM of BoNT/F (EP-F). The cells were subsequently cultured for 3 days. The release of insulin from the cells during a 30-min incubation period with 4.8 mM KCl-KRB (LK-KRB) or 30 mM KCl-KRB (HK-KRB) was then determined by specific radioimmunoassay.

As observed for BoNT/B, insulin secretion was unaffected by the BoNT/F treatment (Fig. 3).DISCUSSIONA docking/fusion complex composed of SNAP-25, syntaxin, and synaptobrevin has been proposed as an essential step in exocytosis(3Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar). In this study we show that all these proteins are present in the pancreatic cell lines studied. The detection of a syntaxin-like immunoreactive band is consistent with the reported expression of syntaxin 1A in cells of this type (19Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Bergren P-O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12487-112491Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and the known specificity of this monoclonal antibody(30Yoshida A. Oho C. Omori A. Kuwahara R. Ito K. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24925-24928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BoNT/A, which cleaves SNAP-25 in both neurons and chromaffin cells, also cleaves the SNAP-25 immunoreactive protein in the HIT-15 and RINm5F insulinoma cells. None of the other proteins studied was found to be cleaved by BoNT/A. In addition to cleavage of SNAP-25, electroporation with BoNT/A was found to inhibit high K+-stimulated insulin secretion in both cell lines, which is in agreement with the recent findings in pancreatic cells (29Sadoul K. Lang J. Montecucco C. Weller U. Romano R. Catsicas S. Wollheim C.B. Halban P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The inhibition of calcium-dependent insulin release was almost complete in both cell lines, consistent with the observation that the majority of the SNAP-25 immunoreactivity had disappeared from the cells. These results are consistent with the involvement of a SNARE-based mechanism involving SNAP-25 in insulin secretion.Two synaptobrevin-like immunoreactivities were observed in this study. Both were equally sensitive to proteolysis by BoNT/B or BoNT/F. Given that one of the cell lines, RINm5F, is of rat origin, the similar extent of cleavage of both immunoreactivities by BoNT/B or BoNT/F is consistent with this cell line containing synaptobrevin 2 and cellubrevin but not synaptobrevin 1, a conclusion in agreement with a recent report(19Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Bergren P-O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12487-112491Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The identification of the two synaptobrevin immunoreactivities as synaptobrevin 2 and cellubrevin is consistent with the electrophoretic mobilities observed.The degree of cleavage of synaptobrevin in bovine chromaffin cells has been found to be closely correlated with the degree of inhibition of calcium-stimulated secretion(16Foran P. Lawerence G. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5544-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, however, despite the almost total cleavage of synaptobrevin and cellubrevin seen, only in HIT-15 cells was a blockade of insulin release detected, and this was only partial. As discussed above, insensitivity of Ca2+-dependent insulin secretion from RINm5F cells to BoNT/B is not due to the presence of synaptobrevin 1 in these cells nor would this explain the lack of inhibition by BoNT/F.Thus data for SNAP-25 supports the involvement of a SNARE complex in insulin secretion; however, for synaptobrevin or cellubrevin to be the v-SNARE in RINm5F cells would require them to be present in at least a 10-fold excess. Alternatively, there could be an unidentified v-SNARE in these cells, which is not a substrate for either BoNT/B or BoNT/F and which is not recognized by the HV62 antiserum. Whichever explanation proves to be the case, the results presented show that there is no simple relationship between the presence of synaptobrevin 2 and SNAP-25 in cells and the mechanism of Ca2+-dependent secretion. INTRODUCTIONThe clostridial neurotoxins, botulinum and tetanus, inhibit neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve endings (1Dolly J.O. Ashton A.C. Mcinnes C. Wadsworth J.D.F. Poulain B. Tauc L.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The different botulinum neurotoxin serotypes specifically cleave one of three proteins, synaptobrevin, syntaxin, or SNAP-25. 1The abbreviations used are: SNAP-25synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDaBoNTbotulinum neurotoxinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumHK-KRBhigh potassium Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate bufferLK-KRBlow potassium Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate bufferv-SNARE and t-SNAREvesicle and target-soluble, respectively, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-associated protein receptor. A recent model of synaptic vesicle fusion proposes that the vesicle protein synaptobrevin, termed a v-SNARE, and the plasma membrane-associated proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25, t-SNARES, interact to form a receptor for the assembly of a fusion complex involving the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein(3Sollner T.

Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) selectively cleaves SNAP-25(6Blasi J. Chapman R.C. Link E. Binz T. Yamasaki S. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. Jahn R.

In most species both forms are substrates for BoNT/B; however, in the rat synaptobrevin 1 is not a substrate(10Elferink L.A. Trimble W.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11061-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synaptobrevin 1 and 2 in the rat are substrates for BoNT/F(9Schiavo G. Shone C.C. Rossetto O. Alexander F.C.G. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11516-11519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A homologue of synaptobrevin, cellubrevin, has been identified in non-neuronal cells and is a toxin substrate(11McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar).The specificity of clostridial neurotoxins for nerve terminals, particularly the cholinergic terminals of the neuromuscular junction, derives from a selective uptake mechanism(12Dolly J.O.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). When the uptake barrier is removed clostridial neurotoxins inhibit secretion from not only neuronal cells but also from PC12 (14McInnes C. Dolly J.O. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and chromaffin cells(15Penner R. Neher E. Dreyer F.

Synaptobrevin, cellubrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin are found in PC12 and chromaffin cells(16Foran P. Lawerence G. Dolly J.O.

Navone F. De Cammilli P. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and inhibition of noradrenaline release from chromaffin cells has been associated with cleavage of SNAP-25 by BoNT/A (17Dagmar R. Burgoyne R.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and cleavage of synaptobrevin and cellubrevin by BoNT/B(16Foran P. Lawerence G. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5544-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Pancreatic endocrine cells also contain SNAP-25, synaptobrevin, cellubrevin, and syntaxin 1A, 4, and 5(19Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Bergren P-O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12487-112491Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). If these proteins are involved in Ca2+-dependent secretion from these cells, then their cleavage by botulinum toxins should inhibit Ca2+-dependent release of hormones or enzymes from pancreatic cells. Indeed cleavage of synaptobrevin by tetanus toxin inhibits enzyme secretion from rat pancreatic acinar cells(20Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Foskett J.K. Trimble W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have confirmed the presence of SNAP-25, syntaxin, and synaptobrevin immunoreactivities in the β-pancreatic cell lines, HIT-15 and RINm5F, and determined the effect of BoNT/A, −B, and −F both on these proteins and on the release of insulin. To study the effects of the toxins in these cells it was necessary to introduce them into the cell cytoplasm, and electroporation was used for this purpose(21Bartels F. Bigalke H. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 302-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2031206863,"p120 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is a negative regulator of Ras that functions at a key relay point in signal transduction pathways that control cell proliferation. Among other proteins, p120 GAP associates with p190, a GAP for the Ras-related protein, Rho. To characterize the p120•p190 interaction further, we used bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion polypeptides to map the regions of p120 necessary for its interactions with p190. Our results show that both the N-terminal and the C-terminal SH2 domains of p120 are individually capable of binding p190 expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system. Moreover, the two SH2 domains together on one polypeptide bind synergistically to p190, and this interaction is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of p190. In addition, mutation of the highly conserved Arg residues in the critical FLVR sequences of both SH2 domains of full-length p120 reduces binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated p190. The dependence on p190 phosphorylation for complex formation with p120 SH2 domains observed in vitro is consistent with analysis of the native p120•p190 complexes formed in vivo. These findings suggest that SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction is one mechanism by which the cell regulates p120•p190 association and thus may be a means for coordinating the Ras- and Rho-mediated signaling pathways. p120 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is a negative regulator of Ras that functions at a key relay point in signal transduction pathways that control cell proliferation.

In mammalian cells, Ras acts as a molecular relay in a mitogenic signal transduction network that ultimately regulates initiation of DNA replication(1Kung H.F. Smith M.R. Bekesi E. Manne V.

Upon growth factor stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases or activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, Ras is activated by binding to GTP(3Lowy D. Willumsen B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Google Scholar). Activated Ras subsequently binds downstream effectors, including the Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase, which in turn activates a cytoplasmic kinase cascade, thus conveying mitogenic signals from the cell surface to their eventual nuclear destination (4Heidecker G.

This role is also performed by the p120 SH2 domains, which are necessary for interactions between p120 and kinases, including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and the Src tyrosine kinase, as well as cytoplasmic proteins such as the p120 GAP-associated protein, p62 (22Kaplan D.R.

While the importance of the N-terminal SH2 domain in p120 for protein-protein interactions has been illustrated(26Anderson D. Koch C. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Google Scholar, 27Moran M. Koch A. Anderson D. Ellis C. England L. Martin G. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8622-8626Google Scholar, 28Marengere L. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22779-22786Google Scholar), the necessary presence of the C-terminal SH2 domain has not previously been demonstrated, raising the question of the significance of two SH2 domains in p120. p120 GAP associates with several proteins that are potentially important for the regulation or function of p120 and Ras, including the 190-kDa phosphoprotein, p190. Despite its large size and multiple domains, only two functions have been ascribed thus far to p190, that of being a GAP for the Rho/Rac family of GTPases (29Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Google Scholar) and binding directly to GTP(30Foster R. Hu K.-Q. Shaywitz D. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7173-7181Google Scholar). 2 2R. Roof, J.-H. Chang, and S. J. Parsons, manuscript submitted. This subfamily of Ras-related proteins is involved in membrane ruffling and formation of actin stress fibers in response to growth factor stimulation(32Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar, 33Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar). In v-Src-transformed or epidermal growth factor-stimulated cells, the majority of cytoplasmic p120 is complexed with p190(34Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Google Scholar, 35Moran M. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Google Scholar). The biological significance of this interaction between the p120 and p190 GAPs is not yet clear. One attractive possibility is that through this complex, cells may couple the Ras-mediated signaling pathway to that of other GTPases, such as Rho or Rac, thereby coordinating DNA replication with changes in cell morphology. To characterize in more detail the p120•p190 interaction, we have used a series of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins containing isolated regions of p120 to precisely map the domains that interact with p190 expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system. Our results show that the two SH2 domains of p120 bind in a synergistic manner to tyrosine phosphorylated p190. Upon mutating critical SH2 residues, which are involved in mediating interactions with phosphotyrosine, binding of full-length p120 to tyrosine phosphorylated p190 is reduced. Consistent with these in vitro binding studies, p120 association with p190 in rat fibroblasts transformed by v-Src correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation of p190. These results suggest that SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions contribute to regulation of p120•p190 complex formation in the cell and in this way may coordinate the Ras- and Rho-mediated signaling pathways during cell proliferation. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured as described previously(36O'Reilly D. Miller L. Luckow V. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, NY1992Google Scholar). For protein production, Sf9 cells were singly infected or coinfected with recombinant baculovirus stocks using a multiplicity of infection of 10 for each virus(25Park S. Liu X. Pawson T. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17194-17200Google Scholar). Untransformed (3Y1) and v-Src-transformed (SR3Y1) rat fibroblasts (37Kawai S. J. Virol. 1980; 34: 772-776Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously(38Park S. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25728-25734Google Scholar).

The complete human p190 cDNA was also expressed from a baculoviral recombinant.4 4G. Martin and F. McCormick, unpublished data. Regions of human p120 GAP containing the variable N-terminal region, various combinations of the SH2 and SH3 domains, or the C-terminal domains were subcloned into pGEX-2T and expressed in Escherichia coli(40Hjermstad S. Briggs S. Smithgall T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10519-10525Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mM benzamidine. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and then cells were lysed by sonication and clarified. The soluble fraction was incubated with glutathione-coated Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 30 min at 4°C and washed 3 times in washing buffer. Beads were stored in 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 5 mM benzamidine at 4°C. Immobilized fusion proteins were used in subsequent binding assays. Lysates of Sf9 insect cells infected with various baculovirus recombinants were incubated with different purified GST-p120 domain fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times with RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 μM antipain, 0.1 μM aprotinin, 10 μg/ml α2-macroglobulin, 2 mM EGTA) containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and lacking protease inhibitors, boiled in SDS-gel sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Levels of baculoviral-expressed recombinant p190 bound to the GST-p120 fusion proteins were assayed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-p190 antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Corp.). Normalization of GST-p120 fusion proteins used in each incubation with p190 was confirmed by Coomassie stain of the lower portion of the same gel used for Western blot analysis of p190. Levels of p190 bound to GST fusion proteins were quantified from films exposed in the linear range using the AMBIS optical imaging system. 48 h postinfection, Sf9 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer for 15 min at 4°C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min and used in subsequent binding assays. Confluent 3Y1 or SR3Y1 fibroblasts (10-cm plates) were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA lysis buffer as described above. Proteins in cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies for 1 h at 4°C, incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for 30 min at 4°C and then collected by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with RIPA buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Levels of p120 GAP, p190, and their tyrosine phosphorylation states were determined by Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and monoclonal or polyclonal anti-p120 or anti-p190 antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies for detection by ECL. Anti-p120 rabbit polyclonal sera was raised against the N terminus of human p120 GAP (amino acid residues 1-181). Preparation of anti-p120 and anti-p190 monoclonal antibodies as well as anti-p190 polyclonal sera have been described(41Chang J.-H. Sutherland W.M. Parsons S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 430-445Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Previous studies indicated that the majority of p120 GAP associates with a cellular phosphoprotein, p190, in v-Src-transformed cells(35Moran M. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Google Scholar). To determine which domains of p120 GAP mediate this interaction, we used a panel of GST fusion proteins spanning the entire length of human p120 (Fig. 1). Within this panel, p120 SH2 and SH3 domains are present singly or in combination with each other, allowing us to define individual as well as any possible synergistic contributions of these domains to formation of the p120•p190 complex. After expressing these constructs in E. coli, cells were lysed, and fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. These immobilized GST fusion proteins were then incubated with Sf9 insect cell lysates containing baculoviral-expressed p190, and the levels of p190 that co-precipitated with the p120 fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Results show that none of the individual domains of p120 GAP bound p190 to an appreciable extent (Fig. 2A). Similarly, each SH2 domain in conjunction with the SH3 domain bound very little p190. In contrast, the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains together with the SH3 domain contained in the (N+C)SH fusion protein bound p190 to a greater extent. This enhanced binding is not due simply to an effect of the SH3 domain upon the individual SH2 domains, as neither NSH2+SH3 nor CSH2+SH3 fusion proteins bound p190 at levels significantly above those seen with NSH2 or CSH2 fusion proteins alone. Only when both SH2 domains were present did the levels of binding increase, suggesting that the binding of p120 to p190 is mediated by both SH2 domains of p120. Comparison with the levels of p190 in whole cell lysate indicates that approximately 2-3% of total p190 bound to (N+C)SH fusion protein in this experiment. Levels of GST fusion proteins used in each precipitation were determined by Coomassie staining of the same gel (Fig. 2B). Because SH2 domains interact with phosphorylated tyrosine residues, we examined the effect of increasing p190 tyrosine phosphorylation upon its interaction with the GST-p120 fusion proteins. To explore the effects of phosphorylation on p120•p190 interactions, p190 was phosphorylated on tyrosine using a baculoviral c-Src recombinant that exhibits an elevated kinase activity compared with endogenous rodent or chicken c-Src(25Park S. Liu X. Pawson T. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17194-17200Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that p190 is a substrate of c-Src tyrosine kinase in intact rodent fibroblasts(42Chang J.-H. Wilson L. Moyers J. Zhang K. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 959-967Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells were singly infected with wild-type baculovirus or recombinant baculovirus encoding either activated c-Src or p190 or were coinfected with both c-Src and p190 viruses. Cell lysates were loaded in triplicate for separation by SDS-PAGE and assayed by Western blot analysis using anti-Src, anti-p190, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 3, A-C). Results show very little tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 in infected cells by endogenous insect cell kinases; however, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 is markedly increased upon coinfection with the activated c-Src baculovirus, despite the lower overall levels of p190 in the p190/Src virus-coinfected cells. We assayed for p190 binding after incubating Sf9 cell lysates of p190 virus singly-infected cells or p190/Src virus-coinfected cells with purified GST-p120 fusion proteins. Levels of p190 bound to the p120 fusion proteins were determined by Western blot using anti-p190 antibodies (Fig. 4A), and levels of GST-p120 fusion proteins used in each incubation are shown by Coomassie staining of the same gel (Fig. 4B). We quantified the relative binding of p190 to GST-p120 fusion proteins after normalization with respect to levels of p190, as well as to levels of GST fusion proteins used in each incubation (Fig. 4C). Significantly, the SH3 domain of p120 bound neither the phosphorylated nor unphosphorylated form of p190, leading us to conclude that it does not directly mediate the interaction between p120 and p190. Similarly, GST-p120 fusion proteins containing C-terminal p120 GAP regions did not bind phosphorylated p190 (data not shown), implying that these domains do not directly mediate the interaction between p120 GAP and phosphorylated p190. On the other hand, tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 did enhance its binding to the isolated N- and C-terminal SH2 domains to similar low extents. p190 phosphorylation also enhanced its binding to the NSH2+SH3 and CSH2+SH3 constructs to approximately the same extent as the individual SH2 domains, demonstrating that the SH3 domain does not substantially enhance binding of p190 to the individual SH2 domains. Importantly, when both SH2 domains were present on the same polypeptide, binding to phosphorylated p190 was increased in a synergistic manner compared with that of the individual SH2 domains. In this experiment, approximately 30-40% of total phosphorylated p190 bound to (N+C)SH fusion protein, as determined by comparison with the levels of p190 in whole cell lysates. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 increased its binding to (N+C)SH by at least 10-fold compared with unphosphorylated p190. These findings show the dependence on tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 and the necessary presence of both N- and C-terminal p120 SH2 domains for maximal complex formation. To examine the contribution of p120 SH2 domains to complex formation in the context of the full-length protein, we constructed a p120 GAP baculoviral recombinant (RSH2E) in which the highly conserved Arg residue of the FLVR sequence in both SH2 domains was mutated to Glu using polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. This Arg residue is one critical component of the SH2 phosphotyrosine binding pocket and forms an ion pair with the phosphate group(18Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M. Resh M. Rios C. Silverman L. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1992; 358: 646-653Google Scholar). Others have shown using GST-p120 fusion proteins that when this residue is mutated, binding of the individual SH2 domains to p120 GAP-associated protein p62 and the EGF receptor is abolished(28Marengere L. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22779-22786Google Scholar). We expressed the p120 double point mutant as well as wild-type p120 GAP in Sf9 cells, and mixed these p120-containing lysates with either p190 or p190/Src virus-infected cell lysates. The p120•p190 GAP complexes were immunoprecipitated with an anti-p120 antibody and detected by Western blot analysis using anti-p120, anti-p190, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Equivalent amounts of wild-type and mutant p120 GAP were immunoprecipitated by the anti-p120 antibody (Fig. 5A). While both p120 GAPs bound little unphosphorylated p190, the p120 double point mutant bound significantly less phosphorylated p190 compared with wild-type p120 GAP (Fig. 5, B and C). These results are consistent with our GST-p120 GAP findings suggesting that the p120•p190 GAP interaction is mediated by p120 SH2 domains and depends on p190 tyrosine phosphorylation for maximal complex formation. Because p120 protein preferentially binds phosphorylated p190 in vitro, we compared the levels of native p120•p190 complex formation in normal 3Y1 rat fibroblasts and v-Src-transformed 3Y1 cells (SR3Y1). To study the interaction between endogenous p120 GAP and p190 in rat fibroblasts, we characterized several anti-p120 monoclonal antibodies(41Chang J.-H. Sutherland W.M. Parsons S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 430-445Google Scholar). We found that those antibodies that specifically immunoprecipitated p120 and maintained the p120•p190 complex all recognized the SH3 domain of p120 GAP (data not shown). 3Y1 or SR3Y1 cells were lysed and incubated with either anti-p120 or anti-p190 monoclonal antibodies. Resulting precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were probed with anti-p120, anti-p190 or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 6, A-C). The p190 in the v-Src transformed SR3Y1 whole cell lysates is phosphorylated on tyrosine to a higher extent than that in normal 3Y1 cells (panel C). Consistent with our findings using Sf9 cell lyates, the level of p120 GAP bound to p190 in anti-p190 immunoprecipitates was increased in SR3Y1 cells (panel A). Essentially the same result was obtained when monoclonal anti-p120 antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate the p120•p190 complex (panel B). To ensure that the observed phosphorylation-dependent increase in the level of p190 binding to p120 was not an artifact of the particular antibodies being used, the same immunoprecipitation experiment shown in Fig. 6 was performed using three additional monoclonal anti-p120 antibodies. The polyclonal anti-p190 antibody did not immunoprecipitate the p120•p190 complex well, but it did show the difference in the phosphorylation state of p190 in v-Src-transformed versus normal 3Y1 cells (Fig. 7B). These additional monoclonal anti-p120 antibodies confirmed our earlier results; more p190 bound to the full-length p120 GAP when p190 was phosphorylated in SR3Y1 cells compared with when it was not, despite higher levels of p190 in 3Y1 lysates than in SR3Y1 lysates (Fig. 7, A-C). Together, these results suggest that the p120•p190 interaction in intact cells is enhanced by p190 tyrosine phosphorylation.Figure 7:Enhanced binding of tyrosine phosphorylated p190 to full-length p120 GAP detected with different monoclonal anti-p120 antibodies. Confluent 10 cm plates of either 3Y1 or SR-3Y1 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and clarified. p120 GAP and p190 were precipitated from lysates with anti-p120 monoclonal antibody 3F3E6 (3F3) or anti-p190 polyclonal antibody (p190) as indicated at the top of each lane. Resulting complexes were analyzed by Western blot with anti-p190 polyclonal antibodies (A) or anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies (B). C, to extend results shown in panel A, 3Y1 and SR-3Y1 lysates were also precipitated with 2A5B4 (2A5) or 10E6F3 (10E) anti-p120 monoclonal antibodies. Immunopreciptates, along with 2% of the whole cell lysates (WCL) used in each precipitation were analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-p190 antibodies for levels of p190 co-precipitating with p120 GAP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) While the catalytic activity of p120 GAP toward Ras has been studied extensively(10Trahey M.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Google Scholar), the characterization of its interactions with associated proteins, such as p62 and p190, has been less well studied. In v-Src-transformed cells, only a small fraction of total cellular p120 GAP is found in the particulate membrane fraction along with Ras and p62. The majority of p120 GAP is complexed with p190 in the cytosolic fraction of the cell(34Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Google Scholar, 35Moran M. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Google Scholar, 38Park S. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25728-25734Google Scholar). Interest in p190 was heightened after the discovery that it too had GAP-like activity, but it was toward members of the Rho subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins(29Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Google Scholar, 45Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L. Weinberg R. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases (RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1, Rac2, CDC42Hs, and TC10) are Ras-related proteins that contribute to changes in cell morphology, including membrane ruffling and actin stress fiber formation(13Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Google Scholar). Because p190 exhibits Rho GAP activity, an intriguing model has emerged in which the cell, through p120•p190 association, may coordinate changes in cell morphology with stimulation of DNA replication. To characterize further the p120•p190 association, we have used a panel of GST-p120 fusion proteins and the baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system to precisely determine what regions in p120 GAP are necessary for complex formation with p190 and to define some of the parameters that affect this interaction. Our results show that, while none of the individual p120 domains bound significant levels of p190, expression of the entire SH2/SH3/SH2 region in the (N+C)SH construct mediated p190 binding. That the p120•p190 complex is mediated by the p120 SH2/SH3/SH2 region is consistent with other studies, which have localized this interaction to the N-terminal half of p120 GAP protein (27Moran M. Koch A. Anderson D. Ellis C. England L. Martin G. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8622-8626Google Scholar, 46Koch C. Moran M. Anderson D. Liu X. Mbmalu G. Pawson T. Mol. Cell.

Because SH2 domains bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues(18Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M. Resh M. Rios C. Silverman L. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1992; 358: 646-653Google Scholar), we explored the effect of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation upon its association with p120 GAP domains. We show that tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 enhances its binding to the individual p120 SH2 domains to an equivalent limited extent and that the two SH2 domains together synergistically bind approximately 10-fold more p190. Although others have shown examples of p120 SH2/SH3 domains synergistically mediating interactions with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor in fibroblasts, only a small increase in binding of the entire SH2/SH3/SH2 region to the receptor relative to the individual N-terminal SH2 domains was observed(26Anderson D. Koch C. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Google Scholar). In addition, only a low level of the isolated C-terminal SH2 domain bound to the receptor in comparison with the isolated N-terminal SH2 domain, raising a question as to the significance of the presence of the C-terminal SH2 domain(26Anderson D. Koch C. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Google Scholar). In the cases of p120 GAP-associated proteins p62 and the epidermal growth factor receptor, it has been reported that these interactions are mediated primarily by the N-terminal SH2 domain and only weakly by the C-terminal SH2 domain, although potential synergistic effects of both SH2 domains were not determined(28Marengere L. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22779-22786Google Scholar). In our experiments, we show that the presence of the C-terminal SH2 domain is necessary for maximal p120•p190 complex formation, providing evidence for the importance of p120 having two SH2 domains. Even with both SH2 domains present, however, tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 is needed for maximum complex formation. Together, these results suggest that the two SH2 domains in p120 bind synergistically to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in p190. Two additional lines of evidence support the important contribution of SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions to p120•p190 complex formation. First, point mutations of the critical Arg residues in the FLVR sequences of both SH2 domains in full-length p120 reduced binding to p190 (Fig. 5). Second, earlier studies showed that a tyrosine phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the region of PDGF receptor that binds p120 SH2 domains competes with p190 for binding to p120 (31Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A. Turck C.W. del Rosario M. McCormick F. Williams L.T. Cell. 1992; 69: 413-423Google Scholar). While the necessity of both p120 SH2 domains for maximal binding is evident from our results, the role that the SH3 domain plays in this interaction is less clear. From these experiments, we can conclude that the SH3 domain does not bind directly to p190 nor does it contribute to the ability of individual SH2 domains to bind p190. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the SH3 domain might have a structural role, such as providing a spatial requirement between both SH2 domains, that is only possible when all three domains are on the same polypeptide. Consistent with the conclusion that the SH3 domain does not directly bind p190 is our finding that when full-length p120 GAP was immunoprecipitated from rat fibroblasts with monoclonal anti-p120 antibodies directed against the SH3 domain, these antibodies did not disrupt the p120•p190 complex. To extend our findings from the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system, we examined p120•p190 native complex formation in vivo using rodent fibroblasts. Consistent with our insect cell data, more p190 co-precipitated with endogenous full-length p120 GAP from lysates of v-Src-transformed rat fibroblasts than from their normal counterparts in anti-p120 immunoprecipitates. Similarly, more p120 GAP complexed with p190 in anti-p190 immunoprecipitates prepared from v-Src-transformed SR3Y1 cells as compared with normal 3Y1 cells. This increase in co-precipitation of p120•p190 complexes paralleled the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p190, consistent with the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation for complex formation. Previous studies of p120•p190 complex formation yielded apparently conflicting results. Early experiments indicated that the majority of p120 GAP associates with p190 after growth factor stimulation and in v-Src-transformed Rat-1 fibroblasts(35Moran M. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that similar levels of p190 associate with p120 GAP regardless of the level of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts(42Chang J.-H. Wilson L. Moyers J. Zhang K. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 959-967Google Scholar). Still others have found that stable expression in Rat-2 fibroblasts of an N-terminal polypeptide derived from p120 GAP leads to its association with p190 in both growth factor-stimulated and serum-deprived cells(47McGlade J. Brunkhorst B. Anderson D. Mbamalu G. Settleman J. Dedhar S. Rozakis-Adcock M. Chen L. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3073-3081Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these contrasting findings is that the association between p120 and p190 could be regulated at multiple levels in addition to the SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions described here. Indeed, we detected a low level of p190 binding to (N+C)SH fusion protein in the absence of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation by c-Src (Fig. 2). Additional regulatory events might be dependent upon the mammalian cell type, and may not be evident using isolated domains of p120 expressed in bacterial cells. For example, we cannot exclude that there may be other structural features of p120 GAP that contribute to p190 association only in the context of the full-length, native p120 protein. Consistent with this possibility, we observed that point mutations in the FLVR sequences of both SH2 domains did not completely abolish binding of full-length p120 GAP to p190 (Fig. 5). A model consistent with our results is one in which a kinase like Src phosphorylates p190 on two tyrosine residues, thereby stabilizing its association with p120 GAP via the SH2 domains. There is some evidence suggesting that p120 in a complex with p190 has reduced catalytic activity toward Ras(35Moran M. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Google Scholar), raising the possibility that complex formation contributes to Ras activation. Similarly, p190 in the complex may have reduced GAP activity toward Rho family proteins. Alternatively, because the p120•p190 complex is predominantly cytosolic, complex formation may prevent access of both GAP proteins to their membrane-associated substrates. Thus elevated p120•p190 complex formation, promoted by tyrosine phosphorylation and possibly by other regulatory events, might simultaneously activate both Ras- and Rho-mediated signaling pathways.

The electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation system rely upon the functional interplay of gene products expressed from both nuclear and mitochondrial genetic systems. Because of the limited coding capacity of the mitochondrial genome, nuclear genes must provide the majority of the respiratory subunits and all of the gene products necessary for mtDNA1 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNAmitochondrial DNAmtTFAmitochondrial transcription factor ANRFnuclear respiratory factorRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsPCRpolymerase chain reactionCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasekbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)UTRuntranslated region. transcription and replication(1Clayton D.A.

Several of the latter have been characterized from vertebrates in recent years. These include a mitochondrial RNA-processing endonuclease that has been implicated in mtDNA heavy strand replication(1Clayton D.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 141: 217-232Google Scholar), a mitochondrial termination factor that may contribute to the proper rRNA and mRNA stoichiometries within the mitochondria(3Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G.

These studies led to the identification, purification, and molecular cloning of nuclear respiratory factors NRF-1 (10Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Google Scholar, 11Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Google Scholar) and NRF-2(9Virbasius J.V. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C.

Functional recognition sites for one or both of these nuclear transcription factors reside in the promoters of nuclear genes that encode many of the respiratory subunits, mtDNA transcription and replication factors, and the rate-limiting heme biosynthetic enzyme (10Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Google Scholar, 11Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Google Scholar, 13Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl.

These findings led to the hypothesis that NRFs may facilitate nuclear-mitochondrial interactions through their activation of these nuclear target genes(11Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Google Scholar, 13Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1309-1313Google Scholar). Recently, a fatal human genetic defect resulting in the depletion of mtDNA has been described(15Moraes C.T. Shanske S. Tritschler H.-J. Aprille J.R. Andreetta F. Bonilla E. Schon E.A. DiMauro S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 492-501Google Scholar, 16Tritschler H.-J. Andreetta F. Moraes C.T. Bonilla E. Arnaudo E. Danon M.J. Glass S. Zelaya B.M. Vamos E. Telerman-Toppet N. Shanske S. Kadenbach B. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Neurology. 1992; 42: 209-217Google Scholar). Affected individuals have severely reduced levels of mtDNA in affected tissues, leading to a diminished respiratory phenotype. The majority of known mitochondrial diseases are associated with mutations in the mitochondrial genome and can be genetically transmitted through maternal inheritance(2Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1175-1212Google Scholar). By contrast, mtDNA depletion appears to be inherited as a nuclear gene defect(15Moraes C.T. Shanske S. Tritschler H.-J. Aprille J.R. Andreetta F. Bonilla E. Schon E.A. DiMauro S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 492-501Google Scholar), thus implicating a component of the mtDNA replication machinery itself or a regulatory gene required for the maintenance of mtDNA. It is intriguing in this context that mtTFA levels have been shown to vary with mtDNA in patients displaying the extremes of depletion and pathological proliferation of mtDNA (17Larsson N.-G. Oldfors A. Holme E. Clayton D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1374-1381Google Scholar, 18Poulton J. Morten K. Freeman-Emmerson C. Potter C. Sewry C. Dubowitz V. Kidd H. Stephenson J. Whitehouse W. Hansen F.J. Parisi M. Brown G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1763-1769Google Scholar) and that NRF-1 has been found to be an important activator of the mtTFA promoter(13Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1309-1313Google Scholar). Here, we describe the structure, expression, and chromosomal assignment of the human gene encoding NRF-1. This information should be useful in elucidating the potential involvement of the NRF-1 gene in human mitochondrial diseases resulting from nuclear gene defects. A human placenta genomic library constructed from Sau3AI partial digestion products cloned into EMBL-3 SP6/T7 (CLONTECH) was screened with random primer-labeled radioactive probes (19Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar) derived from the NRF-1 cDNA (11Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Google Scholar) as described previously(20Scarpulla R.C. Agne K.M. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6480-6486Google Scholar). Phage DNA was prepared from purified positive isolates by an established procedure(21Kaslow D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6767Google Scholar). Hybridizing fragments were first cloned into pGEM7zf(+) or pGEM5zf(+) (Promega) and then subcloned into M13 vectors (New England Biolabs Inc.) for DNA sequencing on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method(22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Human genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with PstI; electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel along with PstI-digested DNA from ϕ 9-1, ϕ 47-1, ϕ 39-1, ϕ 6-2, and ϕ 12-1; and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filter was probed with a random primer-labeled (19Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar) NRF-1 cDNA probe containing the entire coding region (11Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Google Scholar) as described previously(23Scarpulla R.C. Agne K.M. Wu R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 739-743Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out as described(23Scarpulla R.C. Agne K.M. Wu R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 739-743Google Scholar), except that the filter was washed consecutively in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS and in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and in 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS for 30 min at 65°C. The following primers were used for the amplification of the 5’-end of NRF-1 by the method of RACE-PCR: primer 1 (cDNA synthesis), 5’-CCACTGCATGTGCTTCTATGGTAG-3’; and primer 2 (nested primer for PCR amplification), 5’-CACTCCGTGTTCCTCCATG-3’. RACE-PCR was carried out with reagents provided in the 5’-Amplifinder RACE kit obtained from CLONTECH according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of HeLa poly(A)+ RNA using a primer within the NRF-1 coding region extending from positions 263 to 286 in an antisense direction (primer 1). Amplification was performed with a “nested” primer (primer 2) complementary to the NRF-1 coding region (positions 225-243 in an antisense direction) and an anchor primer provided with the kit. PCR mixtures were heated at 82°C for 1 min prior to addition of primers. After addition of primers, amplification was carried at 94°C for 45 s, 60°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 2 min for 35 cycles with a final extension time of 7 min at 72°C. The PCR product was extracted once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. A portion of the PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and the insert was sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method(22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Uniformly labeled, single-stranded probes were generated by the method of Burke (24Burke J.F. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 30: 63-68Google Scholar) using an M13 template containing sequences upstream of position 91 and the antisense primer shown in Fig. 3A. Hybridization to RNA and S1 nuclease digestion were carried out as described previously(25Scarpulla R.C. Wu R. Cell. 1983; 32: 473-482Google Scholar). A 2-kb HindIII fragment containing 5’UTR-1 and upstream sequences was excised from ϕ 2-1 and cut at the NaeI site at position +38. The resulting 1.1-kb fragment was cloned into the HindIII and SmaI sites in the polylinker of pGEM7zf(+). An NsiI-Asp718I fragment was excised from this construction and cloned into the corresponding sites in the polylinker of RC4CAT/+17(9Virbasius J.V. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 380-392Google Scholar), thus fusing the first 38 bp of 5’UTR-1 to position +17 of the RC4CAT first exon to generate NRF-1CAT. COS-1, HeLa, and L6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. COS-1 and HeLa cells were allowed to grow to 80% confluence prior to transfections, while L6 cells were grown to ~50% confluence in 100-mm dishes. Transfections were performed in 100-mm plates by the CaPO4 precipitation method as previously described (8Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5631-5638Google Scholar) using 20 μg of DNA consisting of 5 μg of test plasmid, 1 μg of pRSVLacZ(26MacGregor G.R. Mogg A.E. Burke J.F. Caskey C.T. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 253-265Google Scholar), and 14 μg of pGEM-4 blue carrier plasmid. The CaPO4 precipitate was prepared by the dropwise addition of 60 μg of DNA (in the proportions described above) and 180 μl of 2 M CaCl2 to a 15-ml polypropylene tube containing 1.5 ml of 208 mM HEPES, 136 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 11.2 mM glucose, and 1.4 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.1) and water to give a final volume of 3 ml. Addition of DNA was accompanied by the bubbling of air into the mixture in order to facilitate the formation of a uniform precipitate. The precipitate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with vortexing every 10 min. CaPO4/DNA precipitate (1 ml) was added to each of three 100-mm plates of cells. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were washed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then refed. After an additional 24 h, cells from triplicate plates were harvested into 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. CAT assays were performed as described previously(27Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 35-41Google Scholar), and cell extracts were assayed for β-galactosidase activity (28Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Google Scholar) to normalize for transfection efficiency. Total tissue RNA was prepared from adult Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc.) by LiCl precipitation as described(29Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6791-6796Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA were analyzed for NRF-1 and cytochrome c message levels by RNase protection assays(30Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 397-415Google Scholar). The cytochrome c transcript was assayed with a SP6-generated riboprobe derived from a cloned 167-bp fragment spanning the splice junction between the rat cytochrome c first intron and second exon. The NRF-1 antisense riboprobe was generated from a cloned 305-bp fragment containing CE-8 of the rat NRF-1 gene and some flanking intron sequences. Hybridization of probe and RNA was carried out as described(6Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14361-14368Google Scholar), except for a reduction in the RNase digestion time from 1 h to 30 min. The following oligonucleotide primers were used: NRF-1 6-2F, 5’-GATGACCACACTGTTCTCTTCC-3’; and NRF-1 6-2R, 5’-CTGGTAGCCCTCAGGTTTACTC-3’. NRF-1 6-2F is a sense primer specific for intron sequences immediately preceding the 5’-splice junction of CE-5, while NRF-1 6-2R is an antisense primer specific for the region downstream of the 3’-splice junction of CE-6 (see Fig. 1). Purified genomic DNA from Chinese hamster ovary cells and a panel of human-hamster hybrids (see Table 2) from BIOS Laboratories (New Haven, CT) were subjected to PCR amplification using primers NRF-1 6-2F and NRF-1 6-2R. Human (Sigma) and Chinese hamster ovary genomic DNAs (100 ng each) along with 250 ng of DNA from each of the hybrid lines were amplified in 100-μl reactions containing 40 pmol of each primer, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, 200 μM each dNTP, 10 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.001% (w/v) gelatin. After an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, Taq polymerase was added at 72°C. Amplification was carried out at 95°C for 1 min, 65°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min for 35 cycles, followed by a 15-min extension at 72°C. A 20-μl aliquot of each PCR was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and the products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Chromosomal localization of the NRF-1 locus by fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed at BIOS Laboratories. Cesium chloride-banded DNA from ϕ 47-1 (see Fig. 1) was nick-translated with biotin-dUTP, combined with sheared human DNA, and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Cohybridizations with a centromere-specific probe were performed to confirm the identity of the labeled chromosome. Hybridization signals were detected by incubation of the post-hybridization slides in fluorescein-conjugated avidin. Upon detection of the signal, the slides were counterstained with propium iodide and analyzed. Screening of a human placenta genomic library with a probe derived from the human NRF-1 cDNA clone (11Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Google Scholar) led to the initial isolation of six overlapping phages spanning ~57 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 1). Regions of overlap were determined by restriction enzyme mapping and hybridization analysis of phage DNA (data not shown). The DNA sequences were determined for subcloned segments from each isolate that hybridized to the NRF-1 cDNA and included coding regions, untranslated regions, and intron/exon junctions. These sequences have been deposited in GenBank™ under accession numbers U18375-U18383. The human gene consists of nine protein coding exons (CE-1 through CE-9) interrupted by introns ranging in size from 0.8 to 15 kb (Fig. 1). Genomic hybridization analysis performed under normal stringency conditions using a NRF-1 cDNA probe revealed eight prominent PstI restriction enzyme fragments in human genomic DNA (Fig. 2, lane 1). To determine whether the six phage isolates can account for these genomic fragments, DNA from each phage was digested with PstI and run simultaneously. The results demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence between the NRF-1 PstI fragments in genomic DNA and those present in the phage isolates (compare lane 1 with lanes 2-6). Moreover, the relative intensities of the hybridization signals were very similar between genomic and phage DNAs. Although sequences more distantly related to NRF-1 may be present in the human genome, these results demonstrate that those most closely related to the NRF-1 cDNA are likely present in a single contiguous locus. At its 5’-end, CE-1 has only 6 bp of 5’-untranslated region matching that of the original NRF-1 cDNA. The point of divergence with this cDNA coincides with the consensus for an intron acceptor splice junction, indicating that additional upstream exon(s) contain the remainder of the 5’-untranslated region. RACE-PCR was performed on HeLa cell poly(A)+ RNA for the purpose of obtaining a complete 5’-untranslated region that would facilitate the identification and isolation of the 5’-end of the NRF-1 gene. Hybridization of the RACE-PCR product (Fig. 3A) to ϕ 9-1 revealed a single fragment containing a 5’-untranslated region exon designated 5’UTR-2 (Fig. 3, A and B). This exon was separated from CE-1 by an intron of ~5 kb (Fig. 3B, I-2). The remainder of the RACE-PCR product was not present on ϕ 9-1. However, rescreening the library with a synthetic oligomer containing a sequence within the RACE-PCR product just upstream from 5’UTR-2 yielded ϕ 2-1, which overlapped the 5’-end of ϕ 9-1 (Fig. 3B). An additional exon, designated 5’UTR-1, was present on a single restriction fragment from ϕ 2-1. This exon was colinear with the remainder of the RACE-PCR product, and no acceptor splice junction consensus was present in the genomic sequence coinciding with the 5’-RACE-PCR end. Therefore, 5’UTR-1 and 5’UTR-2 are contiguous with the NRF-1 gene and likely represent the 5’-terminal exons. S1 nuclease mapping was performed using total HeLa cell RNA to determine whether the 5’-ends of 5’UTR-1 and the RACE-PCR product coincide with a transcription initiation site. As shown in Fig. 4, S1 nuclease cleavage revealed a heterogeneous cluster of initiation sites within 8 bp. These initiation sites overlapped the 5’-end of the RACE-PCR product, and one coincided precisely with the 5’-terminal nucleotide (Fig. 3A). If the sites revealed by S1 nuclease mapping are authentic initiation sites, the 5’-flanking DNA adjacent to these sites should contain promoter activity. To test this possibility, a restriction fragment containing ~1.1 kb of the 5’-untranslated region and 38 bp of 5’UTR-1 was cloned into a rat cytochrome c/CAT expression vector. In this construct, 5’UTR-1 is fused at nucleotide +38 to position +17 of the cytochrome c gene 5’-untranslated region(9Virbasius J.V. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 380-392Google Scholar). Thus, any NRF-1 promoter activity within this fragment would be expected to initiate transcription through the NRF-1 start sites revealed by S1 nuclease mapping. As shown in Table 1, significant levels of CAT activity above the promoterless control resulted from transfection of the fusion gene into COS cells, HeLa cells, and L6 myoblasts. The NRF-1 promoter activity is 18-25-fold higher than the negative control RC4CAT/+17, but 6-11-fold lower than the cytochrome c promoter activity under identical conditions of transfection. The relative differences in these transfected promoters are consistent with the low steady-state level of NRF-1 mRNA compared with that of cytochrome c mRNA (see Fig. 6).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To verify that the transfected promoter utilizes the same initiation sites as the endogenous human gene, promoter-dependent 5’-end formation was assayed by RNase protection in transfected COS cells and L6 myoblasts. The riboprobe used in this assay is specific for the detection of primate NRF-1 genes (Fig. 5). No transcript of the size expressed from the endogenous NRF-1 gene in HeLa cells (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 6) was detected in mock-transfected L6 myoblasts (lane 7) under conditions where it is readily detected in mock-transfected COS cells (lane 2). Transfection of the fusion gene into the rat L6 cells yielded a transcript of identical size to that expressed in the primate HeLa or COS cells (lane 8). Likewise, the level of NRF-1 transcript was elevated by transfection of the fusion gene into COS cells (lane 3). These results establish that 1) both the endogenous and transfected NRF-1 genes initiate transcription at the identical positions; 2) the cloned fragment contains at least a portion of the NRF-1 promoter utilized in vivo; and 3) 5’UTR-1 is the 5’-terminal exon of the human NRF-1 gene. In light of the proposed role for NRF-1 in nuclear-mitochondrial interactions, it was of interest to determine the tissue distribution of NRF-1 mRNA expression. As expected for a regulatory factor, the NRF-1 transcript is expressed at very low abundance in all cells and tissues tested. Therefore, to assay its relative distribution in rat tissues, a portion of the rat NRF-1 gene that is homologous to human CE-8 was cloned and sequenced for use in a sensitive riboprobe assay. The sequence of this fragment has been deposited in GenBank™ under accession number U27700. Cytochrome c transcripts, whose levels of expression are well established in rat tissues(31Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6581-6586Google Scholar), were measured simultaneously as an internal control. It is evident from Fig. 6A that NRF-1 transcripts are barely detectable under conditions where cytochrome c transcripts are easily visualized. The NRF-1 transcripts are observed upon extended exposure of the autoradiogram (Fig. 6B). The highest levels of NRF-1 mRNA expression are in lung and testis, followed by intermediate levels in kidney, heart, and brain, with the lowest levels in muscle and liver. This contrasts with cytochrome c mRNA, which is expressed abundantly in heart and kidney, at an intermediate level in muscle and brain, and at the lowest levels in testis, lung, and liver. Aside from both having their lowest expression in liver, there is little correlation between the expression of cytochrome c and NRF-1 mRNAs. The NRF-1 gene may ultimately prove to be a target for mutations that affect mitochondrial function. To determine its chromosomal location, a panel of human-hamster hybrid DNAs were subjected to PCR amplification using NRF-1 gene-specific primers complementary to segments of introns I-6 and I-8 as indicated in Fig. 1. Electrophoresis of the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel followed by ethidium bromide staining revealed the expected size fragment of 1.5 kb in the lane containing amplification products from human genomic DNA (Fig. 7). The size of the amplified product corresponded to the sum of the sizes of exons CE-5 (158 bp) and CE-6 (197 bp) and the intervening intron I-7 of 1.2 kb (see Fig. 1). No amplification product was observed when hamster DNA was used as the PCR template (Fig. 7), indicating that the primers are human-specific. Analysis of the amplification products obtained using a panel of DNA samples extracted from human-hamster cell hybrids as templates for PCR showed the 1.5-kb fragment only in cell lines 756 and 1006 (Fig. 7). Examination of the human chromosomal composition of the various hybrid lines (Table 2) revealed that the only human chromosome present in lines 756 and 1006 and not in the other hybrids is chromosome 7. This result was verified using a second set of human-specific primers derived from the 5’-end of the gene (data not shown). To confirm the assignment of the NRF-1 locus to chromosome 7 and to further map its position within this chromosome, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of human metaphase chromosomes was performed. Hybridizations were carried out using biotin-dUTP-labeled ϕ 47-1 DNA and resulted in the specific labeling of the long arm (q) of a group C chromosome, the size and morphology of which were consistent with chromosome 7 (data not shown). To further establish the identity of the labeled chromosome, a chromosome 7 centromere-specific probe was cohybridized to metaphase chromosomes along with labeled ϕ 47-1 DNA from the NRF-1 gene (see Fig. 1). In each of the four separate determinations shown in Fig. 8, hybridizing bands were detectable at the centromere and at a position distal to the centromere in the chromosome 7 pair. Measurements performed on 10 specifically labeled chromosomes 7 indicated the NRF-1 locus to be present at a position that corresponded to 59% of the distance from the centromere to the telomere of 7q. This position corresponds to band 7q31. The results presented here are consistent with a single-copy gene encoding NRF-1 in humans. Its genomic organization consists of 11 exons spread over 65 kb, and the polypeptide specified by the coding exons is identical to that predicted from the NRF-1 cDNA(11Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Google Scholar). The mRNA 5’-terminus cloned by RACE-PCR contains the two 5’-terminal exons, and genomic clones containing these exons are overlapping and contiguous with the remainder of the gene. An active promoter residing in a genomic fragment containing the 5’-terminal exon initiates transcription at the same sites utilized by the endogenous gene and therefore represents a functional promoter in vivo. These results establish that the gene described here is responsible for the expression of human NRF-1. There is no evidence that the NRF-1 gene is a member of a transcription factor family of related genes. Despite a striking degree of sequence conservation within the NRF-1 DNA-binding domains between humans and lower eukaryotes(11Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Google Scholar), no related human family members were detected by genomic hybridization analysis. All of the recombinant phage clones obtained represented overlapping segments of a single genomic locus. The restriction fragments from these genomic clones that hybridized to the NRF-1 cDNA probe accounted for all of those detected in total genomic DNA. Finally, only a single NRF-1 chromosomal locus mapping to 7q31 was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using a probe encompassing a highly conserved region of the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 1, CE-2 and CE-3). The presence of NRF-1 recognition sites in many nuclear genes whose products function in the mitochondria suggests a role for NRF-1 in nuclear-mitochondrial interactions(10Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Google Scholar, 11Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Google Scholar, 13Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1309-1313Google Scholar). In at least two of these genes, mtTFA and 5-aminolevulinate synthase, the NRF-1 sites have been found to be important determinants of promoter function(13Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1309-1313Google Scholar, 14Braidotti G. Borthwick I.A. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1109-1117Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of D-loop promoters by mtTFA facilitates the synthesis of mitochondrial RNAs as well as heavy strand replication primers(1Clayton D.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 141: 217-232Google Scholar, 4Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16083-16086Google Scholar). Thus, NRF-1 may help coordinate the synthesis of respiratory subunits from both genomes and contribute to the maintenance of mtDNA through its effects on mtTFA expression. Recently, mtTFA levels were found to be reduced in patients with mtDNA depletion(17Larsson N.-G. Oldfors A. Holme E. Clayton D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1374-1381Google Scholar, 18Poulton J. Morten K. Freeman-Emmerson C. Potter C. Sewry C. Dubowitz V. Kidd H. Stephenson J. Whitehouse W. Hansen F.J. Parisi M. Brown G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1763-1769Google Scholar). Elevated mtTFA levels have also been found in the ragged-red muscle fibers of patients with mtDNA deletions that lead to the abnormal proliferation of mtDNA(17Larsson N.-G. Oldfors A. Holme E. Clayton D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1374-1381Google Scholar). Thus, mtTFA seems to vary with mtDNA in these individuals. One possibility is that the reduction in mtTFA is not a primary cause of mtDNA depletion, but rather a consequence of reduced mtDNA levels. The fact that a patient with reduced mtDNA and mtTFA also had low mtTFA RNA levels argues that the primary defect may be in the synthesis or degradation of mtTFA RNA (18Poulton J. Morten K. Freeman-Emmerson C. Potter C. Sewry C. Dubowitz V. Kidd H. Stephenson J. Whitehouse W. Hansen F.J. Parisi M. Brown G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1763-1769Google Scholar). Cell lines that are transiently depleted of mtDNA with dideoxycytidine (32Chen C.-H. Cheng Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11934-11937Google Scholar) had reduced mtTFA but increased mtTFA RNA, suggesting that expression is up-regulated at a pre-translational level in response to the loss of mtDNA(18Poulton J. Morten K. Freeman-Emmerson C. Potter C. Sewry C. Dubowitz V. Kidd H. Stephenson J. Whitehouse W. Hansen F.J. Parisi M. Brown G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1763-1769Google Scholar). One intriguing possibility is that mutation in a regulatory gene encoding NRF-1 or some other factor may lead to reduced expression of mtTFA and consequently the loss of mtDNA. Similarly, reduction of mtDNA by dideoxycytidine treatment or impaired respiratory function from mtDNA mutation may lead to the activation of mtTFA transcription by NRF-1. However, the fact that mtTFA RNA levels are unchanged in established cell lines lacking mtDNA as a result of propagation in ethidium bromide (17Larsson N.-G. Oldfors A. Holme E. Clayton D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1374-1381Google Scholar, 33Tominaga K. Hayashi J. Kagawa Y. Ohta S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 544-551Google Scholar) is inconsistent with such a feedback mechanism and with the results obtained with dideoxycytidine(18Poulton J. Morten K. Freeman-Emmerson C. Potter C. Sewry C. Dubowitz V. Kidd H. Stephenson J. Whitehouse W. Hansen F.J. Parisi M. Brown G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1763-1769Google Scholar). It will be of considerable interest to determine whether mutations in the NRF-1 gene can lead to aberrant mtDNA copy number control and to impaired oxidative metabolism. The isolation, characterization, and chromosomal assignment of the human NRF-1 gene should aid in evaluating its potential role in mtDNA depletion and possibly other nuclear gene defects resulting in mitochondrial disease.

Several lines of evidence demonstrate that kidney band 3 is homologous to erythrocyte band 3 but truncated at its N terminus. First, antibodies with epitopes C-terminal to residue 66 of erythrocyte band 3 have been found to recognize the kidney isoform, while antibodies with epitopes at the extreme N terminus of erythrocyte CDB3 do not. Second, sequence analysis of band 3 cDNA from human(12Kollert-Jones A. Wagner S. Hubner S. Appelhans H. Drenckhahn D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F813-F821PubMed Google Scholar), rat(14Kudrycki K.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7784-7787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) kidney indicates that the major transcripts begin at exon 4, i.e. at Met-66 in the human sequence or Met-79 in the rodent. Third, analysis of band 3 genomic DNA reveals an alternative promoter containing TATA and CCAAT boxes within intron 3 that could be used to drive transcription of a truncated transcript(16Schofield A.E. Martin P.G. Spillett D. Tanner M.J.A. Blood. 1994; 84: 2000-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that a major fraction of kidney AE1 is translated from a shorter message beginning at exon 4. Previous research on the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (CDB3) with glycolytic enzymes and skeletal components of the red blood cell membrane has strongly implicated the region missing from kidney AE1 in peripheral protein binding. Thus, although a sequence near the membrane junction may weakly contribute to protein 4.1 association(17Danilov Y.N. Fennell K. Ling E. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jns T. Drenckhahn D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Lombardo C.R. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9540-9546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), five independent experiments have established that residues at the acidic N terminus are strongly involved in stabilizing the 4.1 interaction(19Lombardo C.R. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9540-9546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, although ankyrin association with CDB3 has been mapped in part to regions surrounding a putative proline-rich central hinge(20Davis L. Lux S.E. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.M. Harrison M.L. Kaster W.M. Bensen M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contacts with the extreme N terminus have also been strongly implicated. Thus, Fabs of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that map to residues 1-20 of band 3 block ankyrin binding, and prior association of ankyrin with band 3 obstructs phosphorylation of Tyr-8 and Tyr-21 of CDB3(21Willardson B.M.

Evidence for an N-terminal interaction with glycolytic enzymes comes from the observation that peptides from the extreme N terminus bind and inhibit aldolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with nearly equal affinity to that reported for full-length band 3(22Jenkins J.P. Madden D.P. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9374-9378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Murthy S.N.P. Liu T. Kaul R.K. Kohler H. Steck T.L. J. Biol.

Furthermore, phosphorylation of Tyr-8 and Tyr-21 within this region of band 3 blocks enzyme binding and the consequent inhibition of catalysis(25Harrison M.L. Rathinavelu P. Arese P. Geahlen R.L.

Finally, the acidic N terminus of CDB3 has also been implicated in the association of hemoglobin (28Murthy S.N.P. Kaul R.K. Kohler H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1984; 365: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Walder J.A. Chatterjee R. Steck T.L. Low P.S. Musso G.F. Kaiser E.T. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with the erythrocyte membrane. Indeed, x-ray analysis reveals that the first 11 residues of band 3 extend ~18 Å into the diphosphoglycerate binding cleft of deoxyhemoglobin and shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the right(29Walder J.A. Chatterjee R. Steck T.L. Low P.S. Musso G.F. Kaiser E.T. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10238-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, except for protein 4.2 (31Korsgren C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5536-5543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (whose site has not yet been localized), all peripheral protein ligands of erythrocyte band 3 appear to associate in part with the extreme N terminus of the polypeptide. Since a Glu-40 ⟶ Lys-40 mutation in band 3 leads to a deficiency in the protein 4.2 content of affected erythrocytes and a consequent hereditary hemolytic anemia(32Rybicki A.C. Qiu J.J. Musto S. Rosen N.L. Nagel R.L. Schwartz R.S. Blood. 1993; 81: 2155-2165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility exists that even protein 4.2 may require this region of band 3 for membrane binding. In view of the fact that residues 1-66 are absent in human kidney band 3(12Kollert-Jones A. Wagner S. Hubner S. Appelhans H. Drenckhahn D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F813-F821PubMed Google Scholar), the question naturally arises whether kidney CDB3 can perform any of the peripheral protein binding functions of erythrocyte CDB3. To directly examine this issue, we have expressed kidney CDB3 (residues 66-379 of the human erythrocyte sequence) and have examined its structure and peripheral protein interactions. We report here that bacterially expressed kidney CDB3 is isolated as a an elongated dimer with similar but not identical structural properties to erythrocyte CDB3. We further show that the kidney isoform lacks the ability to bind ankyrin, protein 4.1, and the glycolytic enzyme aldolase, raising significant questions regarding the function of this cytoplasmic domain. During preparation of this manuscript, Kopito and co-workers (33Ding Y. Casey J.R. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 32201-32208Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) reported that rat kidney band 3 (lacking residues 1-79) is also unable to bind ankyrin. Reagents for the polymerase chain reaction and the corresponding thermal cycler were from Perkin-Elmer Corp. Glycolytic enzymes and protein molecular weight markers were obtained from Sigma. Growth media for Escherichia coli was from Difco. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and antibiotics (chloramphenicol and ampicillin) came from U. S. Biochemical Corp. DNA markers and DNA sequencing reagents were from Biological Research Laboratory, and nitrocellulose was purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. Electrophoresis reagents and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies were from Bio-Rad. Restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were from New England Biolabs. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (pLysS) and the CDB3/T7-7 vector have been described previously(34Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and Sephacryl S-300 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent was from Amersham Corp. The 314-amino-acid KCDB3 cDNA (corresponding to residues 66-379 of the cytoplasmic domain of erythrocyte band 3) was amplified form a CDB3 expression vector (CDB3/T7-7) using two primers and polymerase chain reaction methodology(34Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, primers were synthesized to yield an NdeI site at the 5′ end and a HindIII site with a TCA stop codon at the 3′ end of the amplified KCDB3/T7-7 gene. The primers used were 5′-TCTCATATGGACGAAAAGAACCAGCAGCAGCTG-3′ for the 5′ end and 5′-AGAAAGCTTTCAGAAGAGCTGGCCTGTCT-3′ for the 3′ end. The amplified 1-kilobase pair KCDB3 NdeI-HindIII fragment was then subcloned into a T7 expression vector (T7-7), as published previously(34Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The crude ligase mixture containing the cloned plasmid (Fig. 1) was introduced into competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, and the cells were proliferated. Initial identification of colonies containing KCDB3 was conducted by use of antibodies against different regions of CDB3(21Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.M. Harrison M.L. Kaster W.M. Bensen M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive clones were then confirmed by sequencing of the whole KCDB3 cDNA using Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Expression conditions were the same as for CDB3 clones(34Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, a saturated 10-ml culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) (pLysS) containing the KCDB3/T7-7 vector was used to inoculate 4 liters of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml). When the cell density reached A600 = 1.0, 1 mM fresh isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (final) was added. The culture was then transferred to room temperature (25°C) for an additional 6 h of shaking. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM benzamidine, 0.2%β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μg/ml PMSF) and then stored at −80°C. Purification of kidney CDB3 was similar to recombinant CDB3, except elution from the DEAE column occurred at a lower salt concentration(34Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the frozen E. coli pellets were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles for 10 min in liquid N2 followed by thawing in a 37°C water bath and then sonicated for 2 min at medium power with a Branson Sonifier. The crude cell lysates were equilibrated in 50 ml of DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B with column buffer (10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B beads were extensively washed with column buffer and then poured into a chromatography column (10 × 2.5 cm). Proteins were eluted with a salt gradient ranging from 0.0 to 0.4 M NaCl in a 200-ml volume, and kidney CDB3 eluted at 0.27 M NaCl. The appropriate fractions were pooled and precipitated in 30% (NH4)2SO4 and then subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl HS-300 column (100 cm × 2.7 cm) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The presence of kidney CDB3 was verified in eluted fractions by Western blotting. 20 μl purified kidney CDB3 (1 mg/ml) was hydrolyzed under vacuum for 22 h at 110°C in 30 μl of boiling HCl (Pierce) and amino acid analysis was conducted on a Beckman amino acid analyzer 7300. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was conducted at the Purdue University Laboratory for Macromolecule Structure using a gas phase amino acid sequencer equipped with an on-line 120A PTH analyzer (Applied Biosystem 470, Foster City, CA). Kidney CDB3 was dialyzed in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM sodium borate, 70 mM NaCl buffer adjusted to the desired pH. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter using a final concentration of 21 μg/ml kidney CDB3 in a cell of 1 mm light path at 25°C. The calibration and measurements were completed as described in a previous report(35Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine cross-linking was conducted according to Thevenin et al.(36Thevenin B.J. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15886-15892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kidney CDB3 (1 mg/ml) was oxidatively cross-linked with 1 mMo-phenanthroline and 0.2 mM CuSO4 for 30 min at 24°C in 5 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.0. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to 1 mM and then directly analyzed by a nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the presence of cross-linked products(37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (202275) Google Scholar). The Stokes radius of kidney CDB3 was measured using the methods previously published(34Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH-dependent intrinsic fluorescence titration curves were also obtained as described previously(34Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the ability of kidney CDB3 to inhibit glycolytic enzymes was conducted according to published procedures(34Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ankyrin or protein 4.1 binding to recombinant kidney CDB3 was measured by competitive inhibition of ankyrin or protein 4.1 binding to KI-stripped inside-out erythrocyte membrane vesicles (KI-IOVs)(19Lombardo C.R. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9540-9546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.M. Harrison M.L. Kaster W.M. Bensen M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, kidney CDB3 was incubated at room temperature with KI-IOVs (35 μg/ml) for 3 h prior to the addition of 125I-labeled protein 4.1 or ankyrin. Bovine serum albumin was added with labeled proteins to maintain the total protein concentration at 6.5 mg/ml, and the incubation was continued for 20 min. Bound and free protein 4.1 or ankyrin were then separated by pelleting the IOVs through phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 20% sucrose and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The plastic microcentrifuge tubes were then frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the tips were cut off and counted for radioactivity in a γ-counter. The amplified KCDB3 gene was inserted into NdeI and HindIII sites of a T7-7 vector (Fig. 1) and expressed in E. coli strain B21 (DE3) (pLysS), as described under “Methods.” Several lines of evidence suggest that the desired KCDB3 gene product was in fact obtained. First, the entire insert was sequenced and found to correspond to the nucleotide sequence of amino acids 66-379 of CDB3. Second, Western blot analysis revealed that antibodies with epitopes evenly spaced along CDB3 all cross-reacted with the KCDB3 gene product, except those with epitopes within the first 65 residues of CDB3(21Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.M. Harrison M.L. Kaster W.M. Bensen M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, Edman degradation of the first 11 amino acids of KCDB3 yielded a sequence corresponding to residues 66-76 of CDB3 (data not shown). Structural analyses have revealed both similarities and differences between CDB3 and kidney CDB3. Comparison of the circular dichroism spectra of the two isoforms showed only minor variations in α-helical and β-pleated sheet content (Fig. 2). Kidney CDB3 exhibited slightly lower ellipticity at 222 nm but comparable ellipticity at 208 nM. Within experimental error, they both contain approximately 35-40%α-helix (35Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second structural characteristic of erythrocyte CDB3 is its pH-dependent conformational equilibrium. Between pH 6 and 10, CDB3 has been shown to reversibly elongate, with an increase in Stokes radius from 55 to 66 Å(34Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar analysis of kidney CDB3 showed a Stokes radius increase from ~56 to ~66 Å over the same pH range (Fig. 3). To ensure that these values were not influenced by the choice of gel filtration media, the Stokes radius of cloned CDB3 was examined on the same column at the same pHs. As seen in Fig. 3, recombinant erythrocyte CDB3 also expands from an RS ~55 to ~67 Å between pH 6.5 and 10.5. Based on these data, it can be concluded that kidney CDB3 undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change similar to erythrocyte CDB3. Furthermore, like erythrocyte CDB3(38Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the kidney isoform must have a highly elongated morphology, even though it lacks the N-terminal 65 amino acids of CDB3. Since erythrocyte CDB3 has been shown to be a dimer with an estimated axial ratio of ~10, we hypothesize that kidney CDB3 is also an elongated dimer; however, a more definitive conclusion will have to await further structural analyses. Nevertheless, it should be noted that rat kidney AE1 has recently been expressed and found to be a dimer(33Ding Y. Casey J.R. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 32201-32208Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), suggesting that the subunit stoichiometry of band 3 may remain unaltered by deletion of the N terminus. Most importantly, these data demonstrate that kidney CDB3 is well folded and capable of undergoing a native conformational transition. The above pH-dependent structural change in CDB3 (Fig. 3) has been previously studied by techniques other than gel filtration chromatography. Thus, the conformational equilibrium can also be monitored by native gel electrophoresis, sedimentation analyses, extrinsic fluorescence, ankyrin binding analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence(35Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the Trp cluster in CDB3 lies between residues 75 and 105, we felt its environment might be impacted by deletion of residues 1-65, leading to a change in its sensitivity to the structural transition. To test this possibility, we compared the pH dependence of the Trp fluorescence of CDB3 and kidney CDB3. As shown in Fig. 4 and as reported previously(34Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13070-13076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the intrinsic fluorescence of erythrocyte CDB3 more than doubles between pH 6 and 10, exhibiting inflections near pH values of 7.2 and 9.2 (Fig. 4, squares). In contrast, the intrinsic fluorescence of kidney CDB3 increases by only a factor of 1.6 over the same pH range (Fig. 4, solid circles). Furthermore, no inflections are obvious over the entire kidney CDB3 titration curve. However, that the intrinsic fluorescence change is still the property of a native structural transition can be demonstrated by showing its disappearance upon heat denaturation of kidney CDB3 (Fig. 4, open circles). Thus, the tryptophans near the N terminus of kidney band 3 would appear to respond differently to the structural equilibrium than the same residues in the larger erythrocyte counterpart. A second distinction between erythrocyte and kidney band 3 lies in the ease with which each isoform is oxidatively crossed-linked by CuSO4/o-phenathroline. CDB3 contains a cluster of cysteines arising from the colocalization of Cys-201 and Cys-317 from each subunit in a common pocket(36Thevenin B.J. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15886-15892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3054-3060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Reithmeier R.A.F. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6151-6155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this close proximity, an intersubunit disulfide bond can form under oxidizing conditions between Cys-201 of one protomer and Cys-317 of the other(36Thevenin B.J. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15886-15892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3054-3060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Reithmeier R.A.F. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6151-6155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, in isolated CDB3, an intrachain disulfide linkage (i.e. 201 and 317) is sometimes preferred (39Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3054-3060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Reithmeier R.A.F. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6151-6155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To explore whether kidney CDB3 might display the same disulfide bonding pattern, we compared the sensitivity of CDB3 and KCDB3 to the oxidant CuSO4/o-phenanthroline. As shown in Fig. 5, disulfide cross-linking of either natural or cloned erythrocyte CDB3 yields a dimer of ~85 kDa molecular mass. In contrast, subjection of kidney CDB3 to the same oxidation results in no disulfide bonded product. Therefore, we conclude that the arrangement of cysteines in kidney CDB3 is different than in CDB3. Because a change in proximity between cysteines of only a few angstroms can strongly inhibit disulfide bond formation, these observations need not imply that major structural differences between the two isoforms exist. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase, and phosphofructokinase bind reversibly to the extreme N terminus of the cytoplasmic domain of erythrocyte band 3 both in vivo(22Jenkins J.P.

A paradigm for receptor-ligand interactions among low molecular weight agonists such as retinal and catecholamines has the ligands binding to their receptors at a single site within the pocket formed by transmembrane segments(3Nakayama T.A.

The conformationally critical disulfide bonds present in C5a knit a core domain essential for high affinity receptor binding. Chemical and exopeptidase cleavages demonstrate that the ligand COOH-terminal region encodes the receptor activating sequence, MQLGR(11Kawai M. Quincy D.A. Lane B. Mollison K.W. Luly J.R. Carter G.W.

More recently, evidence for distinct binding and activation sites in the C5a receptor has been derived from mutagenesis and monoclonal antibody studies showing the importance of the receptor NH2 terminus for high affinity ligand binding(13Oppermann M.

Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Nelson N. Vanden Bos T. Beckmann M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7283-7289Google Scholar). Signal transduction by the C5a/C5a receptor pair in COS cells results in minimal activation of PI kinase and undetectable activation of PLC (1Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Nature. 1991; 349: 614-617Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate coupling of the C5a receptor to Gi in polymorphonuclear leukocytes to activate endogenous PLCβ2, by release of the βγ subunits(45Rollins T.E. Siciliano S. Kobayashi S. Cianciarulo D.N. Bonilla Argudo V. Collier K. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 971-975Google Scholar, 46Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschik P. Nature. 1992; 360: 684-686Google Scholar). As the PLCβ2 isoform is absent in COS cells, signaling through the C5a receptor can be assessed by taking advantage of the ability of Gα16 to substitute for the Gαi subunit, which, following activation by ligand, stimulates the endogenous COS cell PLC(27Amatruda T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Google Scholar). These findings suggest that C5a like other peptidergic ligands that utilize GPCRs conform to the message:address model of Schwyzer(19Schwyzer R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1977; 297: 3-26Google Scholar, 20Schwyzer R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1980; 210: 5-20Google Scholar), where the “address” domain binds “recognition” sequences in the receptor and presents the “message” domain to the agonist site in the receptor. Previous studies demonstrate that human C5a can bind and activate the murine C5a receptor with potency almost identical to the human receptor, suggesting that elements in common for both species provide the agonist site. Comparison of the murine C5a receptor to the human molecule demonstrates that the transmembrane segments are well conserved, while extracellular sequences are quite divergent, thus providing a dramatic “mutagenesis” result(1Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Nature. 1991; 349: 614-617Google Scholar, 21Gerard C. Lu B. Orozco O. Pearson M. Kunz D. Gerard N.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2600-2606Google Scholar). Since data to date suggest that the address site for C5a is largely extracellular, we undertook site-directed mutagenesis of hydrophilic and charged residues within the transmembrane segments to investigate potential message sequences. Human C5a anaphylatoxin was expressed in Escherichia coli(22Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9274-9281Google Scholar) or obtained from Sigma. COS cells (CRL 1651) and 293 cells (CRL 1573) were obtained from The American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD. 125I-Human C5a and 3H-inositol were from DuPont NEN. DEAE-dextran (average molecular weight 500,000) and chloroquine were from Sigma. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from IBI (New Haven, CT). Fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse IgG was from Becton Dickinson (Lincoln Park, NJ), biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase-labeled avidin-biotin conjugates from Vector Labs (Burlingame, CA), and mouse anti-horseradish peroxidase IgG1 was obtained from Zymed (South San Francisco, CA). The human C5aR cDNA was modified to express an amino-terminal epitope by adding the FLAG epitope sequence (MDYKDDDDKEF) and converting the initiating methionine (ATG) to leucine (CTG)(23Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Google Scholar). As described previously, this sequence has no significant effect on binding or expression(23Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Google Scholar). The EcoRI/XbaI cassette encoding the FLAG-wild-type C5aR cDNA was subcloned into the mutagenesis vector pSELECT-1 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Altered Sites mutagenesis protocols (Promega Corp.). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (Sequenase, U.S. Biotechnology Inc., Cleveland, OH)(24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Mutant cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pCDM8, for functional studies (25Huang H.V. Little P.F. Seed B. BioTechnology. 1988; 10: 269-283Google Scholar). COS cells were maintained and transfected using DEAE-dextran as described previously(1Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Nature. 1991; 349: 614-617Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured at 8 × 105/10-cm plate 16-24 h before transfection. At transfection, media was replaced with DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum or Nu-serum (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA), 1 mM chloroquine, 400 μg/ml DEAE-dextran, and 1 μg/ml plasmid DNA. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 3.5-4 h, transfection medium aspirated and replaced with 10% Me2SO in PBS for ~2 min at room temperature, and finally replaced with culture medium. All functional studies were carried out 60-72 h later. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained as described for COS cells and transfected with cationic liposomes as described previously(23Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Google Scholar). Binding studies were conducted on intact 293 cells or on crude membrane preparations from COS cells. Membranes were prepared as follows: 60-75 h after transfection cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped into TEN (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl), and ruptured by one cycle of freeze-thaw in liquid N2. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (4°C, 36,000 × g for 15 min), resuspended in TEN, and protein concentration determined by Coomassie Blue staining compared with BSA standards. 106 intact 293 cells or 100-200 μg of COS cell membrane protein were used in binding experiments; in Hank's balanced salt solution, 25 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, incubating with 0.1 nM125I-C5a and varying amounts of unlabeled C5a on ice for 45 min. Unbound ligand was separated by filtration on glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/F) that were soaked overnight in 0.1% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer. Bound ligand was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Each binding experiment was conducted three times in triplicate. All binding data presented in Table 1 were determined using membranes from transfected COS cells. Binding affinities (Kd) and sites/cell (Bmax) were determined using the Ligand program (26Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar). The relative counts/minute bound at 0.1 nM125I-C5a for each mutant compared to wild-type is also presented.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Initial expression studies were performed using FLAG-C5a receptor plasmids transfected in 293 cells. Three days after transfection, cells were suspended by trituration in PBS. Approximately 106 cells were incubated in PBS containing 3% BSA and 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 antibody or isotype matched anti-horseradish peroxidase for 1 h on ice. Following staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse IgG, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry. COS cells were plated on fibronectin-coated glass slide dishes (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and transfected as described above. Cells were washed with PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 3% BSA for 10 min at room temperature to block nonspecific sites. Monoclonal anti-C5a receptor antibody S5/1 (13Oppermann M. Raedt U. Hebell T. Schmidt B. Zimmermann B. Gotze O. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3785-3794Google Scholar) (generously provided by Prof. Otto Gotze, Department of Immunology, University of Gottingen, Germany) was added at 10 μg/ml and incubated 30-60 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and subsequently stained with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by avidin-biotin complex, hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine, and examined by light microscopy (Olympus BH-2 microscope). Controls for nonspecific staining included cells transfected with vector alone, and the staining pattern compared to that obtained with cells fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde prior to any antibody incubation, to confirm cell membrane expression. Ligand-stimulated activation of phosphatidyl inositol-specific phospholipase C was assessed as described previously (27Amatruda T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with C5a receptor or mutant and a plasmid encoding Gα16, ~48 h later they were washed with inositol-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and incubated another ~24 h in this medium containing 10 μCi/ml [3H]inositol and 10% fetal bovine serum. Labeling medium was removed, and cell layers were incubated in triplicate in inositol-free DMEM, 10 mM LiCl, and 0-150 nM C5a for 30 min at 37°C. Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of 10% HClO4 containing 4 mg/ml phytic acid followed by incubation at 0 or −20°C for at least 30 min. Inositol phosphates were purified by chromatography on Dowex-1 (formate; Bio-Rad) (28Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Google Scholar) and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. C5a-induced PLC activation was compared with controls in the absence of ligand and untransfected cells. COS cells transfected with vector alone or with unrelated receptor cDNAs were not activated by C5a. All experiments were carried out in triplicate; values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. percent stimulation above base line and at least two independent experiments were conducted for each mutant receptor. As the carboxyl terminus of the C5a (arginine 74) is crucial for the full potency of signaling activity of the protein (9Gerard C. Showell H.J. Hoeprich P.D. Hugli T.E. Stimler N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2613-2616Google Scholar) our strategy utilized for this first phase of mutagenesis was to mutate residues that are negatively charged or can provide a partial negative charge to neutralize the guanidinium group. The mutants were made of the aspartic acid and cysteine residues within the transmembrane segments (Fig. 1). As shown in Table 1, the binding, signaling, and expression pattern of each mutant was investigated by transient expression in COS cells. Analysis of binding and cell surface expression were performed with transfection of the receptor cDNA alone, while signal transduction for phospholipase C activation was evaluated in cells co-transfected with Gα16. Previous investigations demonstrated no change in binding or expression in the presence or absence of this Gα subunit(27Amatruda T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Google Scholar). Within the transmembrane segments, the C5a receptor contains only two acidic residues (Asp82 and Asp132). These amino acids, as well as Asn119, were each mutated conservatively (Table 1). While the Asp132⟶Asn mutant did not express efficiently on the cell surface, Asp82⟶Asn and Asn119⟶Gln mutants were expressed on the cell surface and bound ligand with slightly lower Kd than wild-type. These latter two mutations had some effect on the ability to express the receptors at the membrane, as the Bmax for each is lower than wild-type. The Asp82⟶Asn mutant is completely defective at stimulating PLC activity, while the Asn119⟶Gln mutant is only 35% as effective as wild-type. Among the cysteine residues mutated, three are required for binding of C5a (Cys109, Cys188, and Cys221). Cys109 and Cys188 are positioned at the homologous positions to the amino acids in rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor that form an intramolecular disulfide bond(29Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.B. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Google Scholar, 30Dixon R.A. Sigal I.S. Candelore M.R. Register R.B. Scattergood W. Rands E. Strader C.D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3269-3275Google Scholar). The mutations on the cysteines in the first and second extracellular loops are not expressed on the cell surface, as indicated by flow cytometry (Table 1). The binding deficit for these two mutations is expected. Cys221 is predicted to lie deep within TMS-5 and oriented toward TMS-4. To determine if mutants were properly expressed on the cell surface, indirect immunohistochemical staining of transfected COS cells was performed using the C5a receptor-specific monoclonal antibody S5/1(13Oppermann M. Raedt U. Hebell T. Schmidt B. Zimmermann B. Gotze O. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3785-3794Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows typical results with wild-type receptor (Fig. 2A) and the Cys221⟶Ser (Fig. 2B) where both are expressed at high levels on the cell membrane of unpermeabilized cells. These results indicate that Cys221 is required only for the binding of C5a. Random mutagenesis at this site may reveal the spectrum of residues capable of substituting for cysteine. Mutation of the remaining transmembrane cysteines had differing effects on function of the receptor. Cys86⟶Ser in TMS-2 resulted in a receptor with normal binding affinity but only ~30% of signal transduction in response to 150 nM C5a (Table 1). Cys157⟶Ser in TMS-4 resulted in a receptor that binds ligand almost as well as natural C5aR but produces no detectable PLC activation. Cys157 is positioned at approximately the same depth as Cys221 and is predicted to be oriented toward TMS-5(31Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Google Scholar). The Cys258⟶Ser mutation binds ligand with wild-type affinity and ~43% of wild-type activation of PLC. In contrast, mutation of both Cys293 and Cys294 yielded a functionally normal receptor for binding and signal transduction. The Bmax for each of these mutants is close to that of wild-type, except for Cys258⟶Ser, which shows 4-fold greater number of sites. The second strategy utilized in our mutagenesis experiments was to probe the role of the structural rigidity of the receptor in ligand binding by mutating transmembrane proline residues. The C5a receptor contains 16 proline residues, 7 of which are within or directly adjacent to transmembrane segments. Of these, 4 (prolines 170, 214, 257, 297) are well conserved among other members of the GPCR family and have been mutated in the muscarinic M3 receptor(32Wess J. Nanavati S. Vogel Z. Maggio R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 331-338Google Scholar). The pattern of functional importance of these Pro⟶Ala mutations in the C5a receptor differs substantially from that of the M3 muscarinic receptor (Table 2). Among the 7 proline TMS residues investigated, three mutants (Pro37⟶Ala, Pro113⟶Ala, and Pro214⟶Ala) bind ligand at 0.1 nM125I-C5a comparable to wild-type receptor, despite the observation that the Bmax determined from Scatchard analysis for each of these mutants is substantially less than wild-type. The other four mutants (Pro90⟶Ala, Pro170⟶Ala, Pro257⟶Ala, and Pro297⟶Ala) are unable to bind ligand at wild-type levels. The expression patterns for these mutations were determined as described for the cysteine mutations above. Only one of the binding-impaired mutants expressed robustly (Pro170⟶Ala); the others were either expressed at very low levels or in aberrant patterns of staining in cells (Table 2 and Fig. 2C). The ability of mutants that bind ligand to stimulate PLC was determined. With the exception of Pro113⟶Ala, all other mutations were only partially effective (Pro37⟶Ala, Pro170⟶Ala, and Pro214⟶Ala) for generating intracellular signals.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Data from other receptors suggest that TMS6 and 7 may be a separate functional domain(33Yokota Y. Akazawa C. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3585-3591Google Scholar, 34Suryanarayana S. von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21991-21994Google Scholar). A mutation was generated converting the Leu277⟶Pro, yielding a non-functional receptor that demonstrates a normal immunostaining pattern (Table 2). This prompted us to produce the neighboring mutation Pro270⟶Leu, generating a protein that binds minimally compared to untransfected cells and does not signal (Table 2). The third strategy utilized to determine elements of functional importance in the C5a receptor involved mutagenesis of intracellular loops. A recurrent theme in receptor function is the interaction of heterotrimeric G-proteins with intracellular loop residues, specifically in the third intracellular loop and the proximal COOH-terminal tail. Seven point mutations were generated and expressed (Table 3). Binding studies with each of these mutants show that three have no effect on binding (Trp230⟶Phe, Gly306⟶Ala, Ser314,317⟶Ala) but have modest to severe effects on levels of stimulation of PLC. The four remaining mutants showed diminished levels of ligand binding at 0.1 nM125I-C5a, but rather dramatic effects on PLC stimulation, indicating a perturbation in the interaction with Gα16. A single point mutation in the first intracellular loop (Arg68⟶Glu), that disrupts both cell surface expression and signal transduction, is unusual as most reported mutations of this loop have little or no effect on expression or G-protein coupling(35Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Google Scholar). The Bmax for this construct is very low, but other mutants with similar Bmax values (e.g. Pro113⟶Ala) have normal signaling capacity.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab G-protein-coupled receptors appear to have evolved a common strategy for the recognition of large peptide ligands. Ligand binding to elements in the NH2-terminal and extracellular loop regions, constituting a high affinity binding site, leads to the presentation of ligand sequences which activate receptors. The identification of the latter sites has been approached in the present work by site-directed mutagenesis of transmembrane sequences. As the activating sequence of C5a is highly polar, we limited our mutagenesis to residues with polar or structural characteristics. Results from other GPCRs have demonstrated that charged and other polar side chains are crucial for maintaining receptor conformation and ligand binding. In the β2-adrenergic receptor, the conserved aspartic acid residue in TMS-3 is required to provide a counter ion to the catecholamine charge. In rhodopsin retinal is linked via a Schiff base to Lys296, and the resulting charge is thought to be balanced by Glu113 ((36Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12592-12601Google Scholar) and reviewed in (37Nathans J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4923-4931Google Scholar)). Some mutations at these sites in rhodopsin are active in the dark. Thus, charged residues within the TMS can be involved in direct interaction with the ligand and/or play a role in the equilibrium between active and inactive forms. In mutagenesis experiments of other receptors, the aspartic acid residues in the canonical tripeptide “DRY” and the TMS-2 motif “LAVAD” have been implicated in G-protein interaction and conformational changes during activation(31Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Google Scholar). The C5a receptor also encodes an asparagine residue (Asn119) at the position where the amino group of catecholamine drugs binds to Asp113 of β2-adrenergic receptors(38Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Hill W.S. Dixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10267-10271Google Scholar). Conservative mutations at these sites demonstrate that Asp132 is essential for the proper expression and trafficking of the C5a receptor. Asp82 and Asn119 bind ligand nearly as well as wild-type, but both are defective at stimulation of PLC via Gα16 (Table 1). This indicates that these residues are crucial components for the generation of the active form of the receptor. Because of differences in PLC activation and because both provide wild-type-like binding, they may be different than similar sites in the β2-adrenergic receptor. The results from mutagenesis of all transmembrane cysteine residues show that three are required for binding (Cys109, Cys188, and Cys221) (Table 1). It has been previously determined for other GPCRs, such as rhodopsin, that cysteines in extracellular loops one and two are linked in a disulfide bond which stabilizes the structure(39Karnik S.S. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17520-17524Google Scholar, 40Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The data from Cys109⟶Ser and Cys188⟶Ser mutants are consistent with these residues participating in a similar disulfide bond in the C5a receptor. The Cys221⟶Ser mutant does not bind or signal and is expressed well at the surface of COS cells (Fig. 2B). Predictions of the structure of rhodopsin suggest that a cysteine residue, present at the homologous position (Cys222), is oriented within the transmembrane pocket toward TMS-4(31Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Google Scholar). In bovine rhodopsin Cys222 can be replaced by serine with little or no effect on function(29Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.B. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the carboxyl-terminal arginine of C5a directly contacts this cysteine residue, as it is predicted to lie deep within the plane of the transmembrane segments. Alternatively, Cys221 may be important for structural changes associated with agonist binding and activation. The Cys157⟶Ser mutant binds C5a almost as well as the wild-type receptor, but when co-transfected with Gα16, fails to activate PLC. This cysteine is predicted to be almost at the same depth within the membrane as Cys221 and is oriented toward Cys221 in structural models of GPCRs. The remaining cysteine mutants all bind ligand with wild-type characteristics and activate PLC. Two (Cys86⟶Ser and Cys258⟶Ser) have diminished ability to stimulate PLC. Structural studies of bacteriorhodopsin show that proline residues within the transmembrane segments introduce kinks in the helices, as the amine hydrogen is not available for helical stabilization(41Henderson R. Schertler G.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. (Lond.). 1990; 326: 379-389Google Scholar). The data presented in Table 2 show that mutation of helical proline residues yields a number of changes in receptor function. Among the prolines mutated, several are required for the proper trafficking to the cell surface as demonstrated by binding and immunohistochemistry experiments. Three fail to express well at the cell surface (Pro90⟶Ala, Pro257⟶Ala, and Pro297⟶Ala), and the expression of Pro90⟶Ala appears to cause dramatic changes in the morphology of COS cells (Fig. 2C). Pro90, unlike Pro257 and Pro297, is not widely conserved in other GPCRs but is present in other chemotactic receptors (formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine and interleukin-8 receptors). The effects of these mutations are likely the result of misfolding of the receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum and regulation of this process by chaperonins. A general defect in the processing of opsin in Drosophila (ninaA) results from mutations in a cis-trans-prolyl isomerase, indicating that proline residues in the TMS play a specific role in the ability of these receptors to form proper structures(42Shieh B.-H. Stammes M.A. Seavello S. Harris G.L. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1989; 338: 67-70Google Scholar). Mutations of proline residues corresponding to Pro170, Pro214, Pro257, and Pro297 in the C5a receptor have been made in the rat M3 muscarinic receptor (Pro201, Pro242, Pro505, and Pro540 in the rat M3 muscarinic receptor, respectively)(32Wess J. Nanavati S. Vogel Z. Maggio R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 331-338Google Scholar). The rat Pro⟶Ala mutations at positions 242, 505, and 540 all affect the Bmax for N-methylscopolamine binding, and the affinity of the Pro201 mutant is two orders of magnitude higher than wild-type. As shown in Table 2, the Pro257⟶Ala and Pro297⟶Ala mutations in the C5a receptor behave in a similar fashion to those in the muscarinic receptor, but Pro214⟶Ala provides 76% of the wild-type binding and is diminished in its activation of PLC. Pro170⟶Ala is expressed on the cell surface and binds ligand weakly, analogous to Pro201⟶Ala in the muscarinic receptor. Additional mutations (Leu277⟶Pro and Pro270⟶Leu) were made in the extracellular loop connecting TMS6-7 (Table 2). Both of these mutants are expressed on the cell surface. Pro270⟶Ala binds ligand (36% of wild-type), and both fail to activate PLC. Studies of rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor indicate that TMS6-7 are tightly associated in the membrane and are able to function in “split” receptor experiments caused by cleavage of rhodopsin with trypsin (43Bayramashvili D.I. Drachev A.L. Drachev L.A. Kaulen A.D. Kudelin A.B. Martynov V.I. Skulachev V.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 583-590Google Scholar) or by co-expression of partial receptors(34Suryanarayana S. von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21991-21994Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the structure of the extracellular loop is critical for adopting the necessary structure for activating G-proteins. Mutations in the intracellular loops of the receptor were constructed and characterized (Table 3). These mutations are unlikely to affect the direct interaction of C5a with the receptor, but may shed light on the contact points of G-proteins with the C5a receptor. In vivo the C5a receptor has been shown to interact directly with Gαi2(44Buhl A.M. Avdi N. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9190-9194Google Scholar, 45Rollins T.E. Siciliano S. Kobayashi S. Cianciarulo D.N. Bonilla Argudo V. Collier K. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 971-975Google Scholar), but due to the lack of expression of Gβγ-responsive PLC isotypes within COS cells, we utilize co-transfections with Gα16 in order to study the receptor's ability to interact with G-protein(27Amatruda T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Google Scholar). Among 7 intracellular loop residues mutated, three (Trp230⟶Phe, Gly306⟶Ala, Ser314,317⟶Ala) have no effect on maximal binding of C5a relative to the wild-type receptor, indicating that these sites are not essential for precoupling of G-protein to the receptor. The stimulation of PLC in each of these is diminished relative to wild-type. Two additional point mutants (Thr235⟶Ala and Thr238⟶Arg) are somewhat diminished in their ability to bind ligand, and the ability of these receptors to stimulate PLC is completely abrogated. This indicates this region of the third intracellular loop is important for efficient coupling to G-proteins. Truncation of the C5a receptor at Gly305 diminishes binding to 30% of wild-type, and as expected abolishes the ability to activate PLC (Table 3). Using site-directed mutagenesis, and subsequent binding and signaling studies of the mutant C5a receptors, we have identified amino acids that are involved in the activity of the message site. These amino acids located in the transmembrane segments are Asp82, Asn119, Cys157, and Cys221. Identification of the specific role of each of these amino acids is beyond the scope of this work, but the nature of these functional groups (acidic, thiol, or amide) suggests that hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions within the 7TMS bundle are crucial for providing ligand binding and G-protein activation. Proline mutations and intracellular loop mutations of the receptor have distinct behavior, for when they are defective in function, the number of binding sites is also decreased, suggesting a processing defect. The message:address model suggests that a unique site in the receptor provides the message sequence. These studies do not distinguish direct effects on the message sequence from effects on other aspects of the change in state from inactive to activated receptor. As agonists and antagonists are developed for the C5a receptor, these mutants will provide additional insights to C5a receptor function and aid in the identification of the second message site."
https://openalex.org/W1988311886,"Five synthetic substrates containing different amino acid residues at the P3 position (acetyl-X-Arg-Arg-AMC, where X is Gly, Glu, Arg, Val, and Tyr and where AMC represents 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) were used to investigate the S3 subsite specificity of cathepsin B. At pH 6.0, the specificity constant, kcat/Km, for tripeptide substrate hydrolysis was observed to increase in the order Glu < Gly < Arg < Val < Tyr. Molecular modeling studies of substrates containing a P3 Glu, Arg, or Tyr covalently bound as the tetrahedral intermediate to the enzyme suggest that the specificity for a P3 Tyr is because of a favorable aromatic-aromatic interaction with Tyr75 on the enzyme as well as a possible H bond between the P3 Tyr hydroxyl and the side chain carboxyl of Asp69.

Lysosomal cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1), a cysteine proteinase normally active in protein turnover, has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including arthritis, muscular dystrophy, and tumor metastasis(1Mort J.S.

It is unique among the cysteine proteinases in that it has both endopeptidase and exopeptidase activities, can accept basic residues in a substrate at both the P1 and P2 positions, and has complex pH dependences(8Khouri H.E. Plouffe C. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Storer A.C. Menard R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 751-757Google Scholar, 9Pohl J. Davinic S. Blaha I. Strop P. Kostka V. Anal.

The detailed analysis of the pH dependence of cathepsin B-catalyzed hydrolyses has revealed that at least seven groups that dissociate in the pH range of 3-9 can affect substrate binding and/or turnover(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses with N-terminal protected monopeptidyl and dipeptidyl substrates or various irreversible inhibitors demonstrated that the S1 subsite prefers positively charged or straight chained aliphatic amino acids but exhibits a very poor affinity for negatively charged or bulky aromatic and branched aliphatic amino acids(11Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-581Google Scholar, 13Pliura D.H. Bonaventura B.J. Smith R.A. Coles P.J. Krantz A. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 759-762Google Scholar, 14Krantz A. Copp L.J.

Mason R.W. Wikstrom P. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 751-758Google Scholar). The S2 subsite was shown to exhibit a preference for phenylalanine and arginine, although the specificity constant, kcat/Km, is 7-fold higher for the former(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). Interpretation of pH activity profile data, obtained with substrates containing an arginine at P1 and either an arginine or phenylalanine at P2, suggested the presence of carboxyl groups in the S1 and S2 subsites with pKa values of 5.4 and 5.1, respectively(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). The identity of the group with the pKa of 5.1 was confirmed to be Glu245 by the kinetic characterization of the site-directed mutants, Glu245⟶ Gln245 and Glu245⟶ Ala245(17Hasnain S. Hirama T. Huber C. Mason P. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 235-240Google Scholar). In contrast to the understanding of the S1 and S2 subsite specificities, S3 specificity remains largely uncharacterized. Brmme et al.(18Brmme D. Bescherer K. Kirschke H. Fittkau S. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 381-385Google Scholar) have shown that the binding of a series of N-terminal succinylated alanine-containing peptide substrates could be improved by increasing the length of the peptide chain. When comparing tripeptide and dipeptide alanine substrates, the former demonstrated a 2-fold increase in the specificity constant kcat/Km. In addition, the S3 subsite was shown to accept proline, unlike subsites S1 or S2(18Brmme D. Bescherer K. Kirschke H. Fittkau S. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 381-385Google Scholar). Brmme et al.(19Brmme D. Steinert A. Friebe S. Fittkau S. Wiederanders B. Kirschke H. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 475-481Google Scholar) also examined S3 and S4 specificity using six tripeptide and tetrapeptide coumaryl substrates. For two of the substrates with valine and phenylalanine as the P3 residue, they found no significant difference in binding energy. However, since the N-terminal blocking groups were not the same for the substrates and the P3 residues selected did not have a sufficiently wide range of physicochemical properties, the optimal specificity of the S3 subsite remained unresolved. In a different approach, Koga et al.(20Koga H. Yamada H. Nishimura Y. Kato K. Imoto T. J. Biochem. 1991; 110: 179-188Google Scholar) digested soluble denatured proteins with cathepsin B. Fragments arising from endopeptidase activity were analyzed, and interpretation of the results suggested a preference for the amino acids glycine, tryptophan, alanine, lysine, isoleucine, and proline at the P3 position of the substrate. Although only qualitative, the results, excluding the observation of lysine at P3, supported the possibility of a hydrophobic pocket at the S3 subsite. In the present paper we describe the synthesis and kinetic analysis of substrates of the type acetyl-X-Arg-Arg-AMC1 1The abbreviations are: AMC7-amido-4-methylcoumarinFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylHBTU2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3, 3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphateEDC1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloridet-Boct-butoxycarbonylCMKchloromethylketoneZbenzyloxycarbonyl. (where X is Gly, Glu, Arg, Val, or Tyr). These substrates were designed to define specificity at the S3 subsite. In addition, the change in free energy of binding (ΔΔG values) for these substrates was determined to compare the relative strengths of binding of the different P3 side chains in the S3 subsite. Finally, molecular modeling studies were carried out for the tripeptide substrates containing either Glu (in its protonated and deprotonated states), Arg, or Tyr in the P3 position to gain further insights into enzyme-substrate interactions. 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3, 3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride t-butoxycarbonyl chloromethylketone benzyloxycarbonyl. The cDNA for rat cathepsin B was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an α-factor fusion construct(21Rowan A.D. Mason P. Mach L. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15993-15999Google Scholar). Yeast starter cultures were grown in synthetic medium and then were grown in 4-liter shake flasks as reported before(22Lee X. Ahmed F.R. Hirama T. Huber C.P. Rose D.R. To R. Hasnain S. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5950-5951Google Scholar, 23Ernst J.F. DNA (N. Y.). 1986; 5: 483-491Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme was harvested and purified as described previously(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). Prior to kinetic analysis, the enzyme concentration was determined by active-site thiol titration using the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64 (N-[N-(L-3-trans-carboxyoxiran-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]-agmatine) (Boehringer Mannheim Canada) according to the methodology of Barrett and Kirschke(11Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-581Google Scholar). Just before conducting experiments for the determination of kinetic constants, the enzyme, in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 1 mM EDTA, was activated for 1 h by the addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 10 mM and then kept on ice(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). The active enzyme concentration was shown to be unchanged for the duration of the experiments. Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters for the coumaryl substrates were determined at 24°C by continuous fluorescence spectrophotometry, using an SLM Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer equipped with the Total Fluorescence Accessory(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). All data were fitted by the nonlinear regression data analysis program Enzfitter, of Leatherbarrow, supplied by Elsevier-Biosoft. Assays were performed in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 3% dimethyl sulfoxide, pH 6.0 or 7.7, and in 25 mM sodium citrate buffer, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 3% dimethyl sulfoxide, pH 4.0. The pH-activity profiles were determined for two substrates, acetyl-Val-Arg-Arg-AMC and acetyl-Arg-Arg-Arg-AMC. These pH-activity profiles were determined over the pH range 3.2-8.4 by measuring kcat/Km at 0.1-pH unit intervals, using the relationship kcat/Km = v/([E][S]) when [S]Km. Assay samples were monitored to ensure that pH was stable over the course of the reaction. Over the pH range 3.2-6.0, the reaction buffer consisted of 25 mM sodium citrate, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 3% dimethyl sulfoxide. In the pH range 5.7-7.7, the reaction buffer was 25 mM sodium phosphate, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 3% dimethyl sulfoxide; and in the pH range of 7.7-8.4, the reaction buffer was 25 mM sodium borate, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 3% dimethyl sulfoxide. The citrate buffer consistently afforded lower activity measurements when compared with the phosphate buffer through the pH range 5.7-6.0, and for this reason there was a break in the continuity of the data of the pH-activity profile. Similar results were observed by Hasnain et al.(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar) for the substrates benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg-X (where X is AMC or p-nitroanilide). The data in citrate buffer were corrected by a factor determined from measurements in phosphate buffer at four separate pH intervals (5.7-6.0) where citrate and phosphate buffers overlapped, as described by Hasnain et al.(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). For the tripeptide substrates in this investigation, a similar effect was evident at pH 7.7, where borate and phosphate buffers overlapped, with greater activity in borate buffer. It was determined previously (12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar) that pH 7.7 was the only value in the pH range where both phosphate and borate buffers could be made to overlap under the ionic strength conditions used in the experiment. Therefore, the following strategy was used to correct for this buffer effect. The enzyme activity measurements at pH 7.7 for the substrate acetyl-Val-Arg-Arg-AMC in each buffer system were carefully repeated in triplicate and were shown to be highly reproducible. By averaging the enzyme activities in each buffer system at pH 7.7 and by calculating the ratio of these averaged activities for both buffer systems, a normalizing factor with small standard deviation was determined. Graphical analysis of the corrected data for two independent experiments using the substrate acetyl-Val-Arg-Arg-AMC and for one experiment using the substrate acetyl-Arg-Arg-Arg-AMC demonstrated that the profiles gave a best fit to the four-proton ionization model of Hasnain et al.(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar), where dipeptide AMC substrates with an arginyl residue in the P2 position were employed. The agreement with previous work supported the validity of this correction for the borate buffer. The peptides acetyl-Arg-Arg-Arg and acetyl-Val-Arg-Arg were synthesized on a Sasrin resin solid support by the employment of standard Fmoc methodology. The side chain functionality of Nα-Fmoc-arginine was blocked with the 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl group. Amino acids were coupled using HBTU in N-methyl pyrrolidone. After being cleaved from the resin with 1% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane, the peptides were coupled to AMC with EDC in dimethylformamide and dichloromethane, once again in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Deblocking the completed substrate was effected by treatment with 95% trifluoroacetic acid and 5% water. The substrates acetyl-Arg-Arg-AMC, acetyl-Gly-Arg-Arg-AMC, acetyl-Glu-Arg-Arg-AMC, and acetyl-Tyr-Arg-Arg-AMC were prepared in solution by the employment of Nα-t-Boc amino acids. In contrast to the solid support method, the initial syntheses of these substrates began with the making of Arg-AMC, and the coupling reaction was carried out in pyridine with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The side chain functionalities of Arg, Tyr, and Glu were protected as p-toluenesulfonyl, 2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, and benzyl derivatives, respectively. Peptide coupling reactions with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide were generally achieved in a double solvent system. Typically, dichloromethane was used to dissolve the t-Boc amino acid and coupling agent. To this was combined the growing AMC peptide, previously dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide. Racemization was minimized by the employment of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Sequential removal of the t-Boc group required treatment with 50% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane at room temperature. Substrates were subsequently acetylated with acetic anhydride in pyridine. Deprotection of the side groups was effected by treatment with a 9:1 (v/v) mixture of hydrofluoric acid/anisole. All substrates were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using varied linear gradients between 0 and 60% acetonitrile, in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Substrate composition and purity were verified by amino acid, mass spectral, and 1H NMR spectral analyses. Exclusive hydrolysis of substrates at the AMC peptide bond was established by using high voltage paper electrophoresis to separate the products after incubation of substrates with cathepsin B. Since AMC is ninhydrin-negative, the basic premise of this strategy was that cleavage at any site, other than the AMC peptide bond, would generate a free α-amino group, which would yield a ninhydrin-positive peptide. Substrates were incubated with cathepsin B in pH 6.5 buffer of the composition acetic acid/pyridine/water (3:100:1,800 v/v/v). Reaction completion was verified spectrophotometrically, whereupon the digests were applied to 3MM Whatman paper and subjected to electrophoresis in pH 6.5 buffer (3:100:900 v/v/v) at a voltage gradient of 60 volts/cm for 30 min. All substrate digests yielded products that tested ninhydrin-negative, demonstrating that cleavage occurs only at the AMC peptide bond. After spraying the chromatogram with the modified Sakaguchi reagent(24Acher R. Crocker C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1952; 9: 704-705Google Scholar), arginine residues were identified as a single red band, indicating that there was only one product containing arginine. The final position of this fragment and its lack of fluorescence under ultraviolet light were consistent with the expected behavior of each substrate after cleavage at the AMC peptide bond. The absence of other Sakaguchi-positive material also ruled out other possible cleavage reactions. Standards of unwanted cleavage products were employed at predetermined concentrations and demonstrated that undesirable digest fragments would have been detected at the 1 mol % level. Modeling studies were carried out for the tripeptide substrates containing a P3 Tyr, Arg, or Glu, the last in the protonated and deprotonated forms. Each substrate was constructed using, as a starting point, the x-ray structure of the inhibitor, Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK bound to cathepsin B.2 2C. P. Huber, T. Hirama, R. To, and S. Hasnain, manuscript in preparation. The MACROMODEL molecular modeling package (25Mohamadi F. Richards N.G.J. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M.G.C. Chang G. Hendrickson T. Still W.C. J. Comp. Chem. 1990; 11: 440-467Google Scholar) was used for this operation. The substrate was covalently attached to the enzyme simulating a tetrahedral intermediate by forming a covalent bond between the active-site thiolate of Cys29 and the P1 carbonyl carbon of the substrate. To refine these enzyme-substrate complexes, low energy conformers were generated using simulating annealing followed by energy minimization. Each complex was subjected to 20 simulating annealing experiments. In each experiment, the complex was subjected to a dynamics simulation during which the temperature varied from 300 to 30°C over a period of 3 ps. The time step was 3 fs. These procedures were carried out using the QXP program developed at Ciba-Geigy3 3C. McMartin, and R. Bohacek, manuscript in preparation. with parameters from the AMBER force field(26Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Google Scholar). Comparison of the positions of the enzyme atoms from the x-ray structures of cathepsin B complexed with several different inhibitors showed that the positions of most of the enzyme atoms did not change significantly with binding of different inhibitors4 4C. P. Huber, unpublished data. (27Jia Z. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Lee X. Mort J.S. To R. Huber C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5527-5533Google Scholar). Therefore, most of the enzyme atoms were held stationary during energy minimization. Residues that were allowed to move were Gln23, Cys29, Asp69, Glu122, and Glu245. Table 1 lists the substrates and the kinetic constants for their hydrolysis by cathepsin B. At pH 6.0, kcat/Km for the substrate acetyl-Arg-Arg-AMC was 4-fold less than benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg-AMC. The difference appears largely due to an increase in Km, which can be attributed to the substitution of the benzyloxycarbonyl group by the acetyl group. This is consistent with the fact that the x-ray structure of the inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Ser-(O-Bzl)-CMK, in a covalent complex with cathepsin B, reveals a favorable interaction between the N-terminal benzyl group and the phenyl ring of Tyr75(27Jia Z. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Lee X. Mort J.S. To R. Huber C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5527-5533Google Scholar). This x-ray structure also suggests that if the binding of the acetyl were analogous to the position of the oxycarbonyl moiety in the inhibitor's benzyloxycarbonyl group, the N-terminal acetyl group, in acetyl-Arg-Arg-AMC, would not make any significant contacts with the enzyme.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab For the tripeptide substrates at pH 6.0, specificity increased in the order Glu < Gly < Arg < Val < Tyr, with a 21-fold difference between the glutamate- and tyrosine-containing substrates. For the two substrates containing either arginine or valine at P3, kinetic analysis at pH 7.7 showed that their second-order rate constants increased only slightly when compared with their values at pH 6.0. However, at pH 4.0, the second-order rate constants were significantly lower than the respective values at pH 6.0. The kcat/Km values of the tripeptide substrates at pH 4.0 were generally 15-20-fold lower than at pH 6.0, the only exception being the result for acetyl-Glu-Arg-Arg-AMC. This major dependence of kcat/Km on pH has been observed previously for dipeptide substrates of cathepsin B which contained a P2 arginine(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar, 17Hasnain S. Hirama T. Huber C. Mason P. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 235-240Google Scholar). The poor specificity observed for the substrate acetyl-Glu-Arg-Arg-AMC at pH 6.0 is best illustrated by a Km value that is too large (estimated at greater than 10 mM) to measure. At pH 4.0, however, under which condition the side chain carboxyl group of the P3 glutamyl could be more than 50% protonated (assuming a pKa of 4.5)(28Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 156Google Scholar), there was a marked improvement in binding affinity as suggested by the drop in Km compared with the value at pH 6.0. As a result kcat/Km values for this substrate were very similar at pH 4.0 and 6.0. For all other tripeptide substrates in this investigation (Table 1), as well as for the substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar), the approximately 20-fold decrease in the value of kcat/Km at pH 4.0, when compared with pH 6.0, is, to a large extent, due to the protonation state of the Glu245 side chain in the S2 subsite of cathepsin B(17Hasnain S. Hirama T. Huber C. Mason P. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 235-240Google Scholar). It was concluded from the investigation of site-directed mutants that the side chain carboxylate of the S2 Glu245 forms a salt bridge with the guanidinium cation of a P2 arginine in dipeptide substrates, such as Z-Arg-Arg-p-nitroanilide. The strength of this interaction, which appears to stabilize the transition state complex, was shown to be weakened by 1.2 kcal/mol upon protonation of the Glu245 side chain carboxylate(17Hasnain S. Hirama T. Huber C. Mason P. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 235-240Google Scholar). This P2 Arg-S2 Glu245 interaction has recently been confirmed by the determination of the x-ray structure of cathepsin B complexed with the inhibitor Z-Arg-Ser-(O-Bzl)-CMK(27Jia Z. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Lee X. Mort J.S. To R. Huber C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5527-5533Google Scholar). For the tripeptide substrates in this investigation, with the exception of acetyl-Glu-Arg-Arg-AMC, the observed drop in the value of kcat and kcat/Km at pH 4.0, compared with pH 6.0 (Table 1), may similarly be explained by a weakening of the P2-S2 interaction upon the protonation of the Glu245 side chain carboxylate. Any drop in kcat/Km which may have been expected for acetyl-Glu-Arg-Arg-AMC at pH 4.0 relative to pH 6.0, due to the P2-S2 interaction, appears to have been compensated for by an increase in kcat/Km because of an improved P3-S3 interaction. Indeed, if the data are normalized to account for the 20-fold drop normally observed at pH 4.0 relative to pH 6.0 for substrates with a P2 Arg and a neutral P3, there is an approximate 20-fold increase in affinity for the protonated side chain carboxyl of the P3 Glu when compared with the deprotonated form. The data for the pH-activity profiles (Fig. 1) were best fitted to a model involving two dissociation events in the ascending limb and two dissociation events in the descending limb as described before for the dipeptide substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). EH4 and E are inactive forms of the enzyme. Data were fitted to this model according to the equation of Hasnain et al.(12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). The pH dependence of cathepsin B-catalyzed hydrolysis of the substrates acetyl-Arg-Arg-Arg-AMC and acetyl-Val-Arg-Arg-AMC (Fig. 1) was very similar to that obtained previously for the substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC (12Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). The pKa values for the former tripeptide substrates were in close agreement with the values for the dipeptide substrate (Table 2). The greater uncertainty in the values for pKa2 and pKa3 were due, in part, to the difficulty of obtaining accurate initial rates above pH 7.9, caused by the pH instability of cathepsin B in that pH range. These data suggest that the interaction of the P3 Arg in the S3 subsite is not to any significant degree a result of a charge-charge interaction, although a weak interaction cannot be ruled out.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Table 3 reports the change in apparent binding energies among the dipeptide and tripeptide substrates at pH 6.0. Results are summarized as follows.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The change in apparent binding energy for the substrate acetyl-Arg-Arg-AMC relative to Z-Arg-Arg-AMC was calculated to be 0.82 kcal/mol, suggesting that the benzyloxycarbonyl group interacts with the enzyme as a pseudo-P3 residue. As mentioned previously, this finding is supported by the x-ray structure of a cathepsin B-inhibitor complex (27Jia Z. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Lee X. Mort J.S. To R. Huber C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5527-5533Google Scholar). In this complex, the benzyl ring of the N-terminal benzyloxycarbonyl group of the inhibitor, Z-Arg-Ser-(O-Bzl)-CMK, makes a direct contact with the enzyme, forming a vertical aromatic-aromatic interaction with Tyr75, with the shortest distance of about 3.71 Å. The glycyl-containing substrate served as the reference for the calculation of apparent binding energies of the P3 side chains of the other tripeptide substrates (Table 3). At pH 6.0, the only P3 side chain that demonstrated a weaker binding energy relative to glycyl was glutamyl, with a ΔΔG of 0.33 kcal/mol. The other three tripeptide substrates, with either Arg, Val, or Tyr at P3, exhibited an improved binding in that order. Although the substrate containing a P3 arginyl has an increased binding energy compared with glycyl, by about 0.81 kcal/mol, this enhancement cannot be to any large degree due to a charge-charge interaction at the S3 subsite. First, a 4-fold effect arising from an ionic interaction between the P3 guanidinium group and a negatively charged group in the S3 subsite should have been manifested in the pH-activity profile. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2, the pH-activity profile data for the tripeptide acetyl-Arg-Arg-Arg-AMC could be fitted by the same equation used to fit the data for the dipeptide Z-Arg-Arg-AMC, and the substrate with a neutral P3, acetyl-Val-Arg-Arg-AMC. Furthermore, the dissociation constants derived from these data were virtually identical. In fact, the ratios of kcat/Km of acetyl-Arg-Arg-Arg-AMC and acetyl-Val-Arg-Arg-AMC are similar at pH 6.0 and 4.0. This is also true for the ratios of kcat/Km of acetyl-Arg-Arg-Arg-AMC and the tripeptide substrates with either glycyl or tyrosyl side chains at P3, which suggests that the P3 arginyl side chain binding is not to any significant extent stabilized by an ionic interaction. The x-ray structure of the complex of cathepsin B and the inhibitor Z-Arg-Ser-(O-Bzl)-CMK suggests a relatively hydrophobic S3 pocket defined by Tyr75, Cα of Gly73, Cβ of Asn72, and Cα of Asp69(27Jia Z. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Lee X. Mort J.S. To R. Huber C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5527-5533Google Scholar). Therefore one may suggest that the improved binding of arginine over glycine at P3 may be largely due to hydrophobic interactions of the methylene groups in the arginine side chain with the relatively hydrophobic S3 subsite. An interaction between the Asp69 side chain carboxylate and the P3 guanidinium cannot be entirely ruled out. However, if it occurs, this interaction does not contribute very significantly to substrate binding (see below for further discussion). At pH 6.0, a comparison of the specificity constants for the substrates acetyl-Arg-Arg-AMC and acetyl-Gly-Arg-Arg-AMC (Table 1) shows virtually no difference. It appears, therefore, that the acetyl methyl and the atoms forming the adjacent amide bond in the tripeptide substrate make no significant contribution to binding. In addition, the x-ray structure of the cathepsin B-inhibitor complex reveals that the oxycarbonyl moiety between the pseudo-P3 N-terminal benzyl group and the P2 residue does not make any contact with the enzyme(27Jia Z. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Lee X. Mort J.S. To R. Huber C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5527-5533Google Scholar). As such, the values for the change in free energy of binding (Table 3) for different tripeptide substrates also serve to define the incremental increase in binding energy of the P3 residue when compared with the dipeptide substrate, acetyl-Arg-Arg-AMC. specificity constants reported in Table 1 and changes in binding energy in Table 3, the nature of the S3 subsite of cathepsin B can be deduced. The S3 subsite shows a general preference for both aromatic and aliphatic groups. At pH 6.0, the substrate with the P3 glutamyl is least favored, whereas at pH 4.0 it is preferred over the arginyl and valyl side chains. Therefore, it appears that a negative charge at P3 seems to disrupt the binding at the S3 subsite. This may be due to a charge-charge repulsion involving Asp69. If the Asp69 carboxylate is responsible for destabilizing the binding of a P3 negative charge, it is surprising that the 4-fold increase in specificity of the arginyl side chain compared with glycyl does not appear to result from a charge-charge attraction with Asp69. A possible explanation for the 4-fold increase in specificity of the Arg side chain compared with Gly is the possible van der Waals interaction of one or more of the arginyl side chain methylene carbons with Tyr75. The 2-fold increase in specificity of the P3 tyrosyl side chain, relative to the P3 valyl, and the 4-fold increase in specificity of the P3 tyrosyl, relative to the benzyl ring of the substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC, may result from an improved interaction of the phenyl ring of the substrate tyrosyl and Tyr75 in the S3 subsite of the enzyme. In the x-ray structure of the cathepsin B-inhibitor complex, the benzyl ring of the benzyloxycarbonyl moiety is about 3.7 Å from the Tyr75 phenyl ring. The kinetic data suggest that both the valyl and tyrosyl side chains in the respective substrates make energetically more favorable contacts with Tyr75 than the benzyl ring of the benzyloxycarbonyl moiety. The modeling study with the substrate containing a P3 Tyr (Fig. 2) revealed that the phenyl ring of the substrate is partly stacked on the phenyl of Tyr75 of the enzyme, with the shortest distance between Cϵ of the substrate Tyr and Cϵ of Tyr75 of 3.4 Å. In the model, the substrate tyrosyl hydroxyl forms a hydrogen bond with Asp69. Another potential contact in the S3 pocket is between the substrate Tyr Cβ and Cα of Gly73 (3.6 Å). The improved contact of the P3 tyrosyl in the S3 subsite, as suggested by the model, relative to the position of the pseudo-P3 benzyl group of the dipeptide inhibitor observed in the x-ray structure(27Jia Z. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Lee X. Mort J.S. To R. Huber C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5527-5533Google Scholar), is consistent with the kinetic data showing a 4-fold increase in specificity for the P3 Tyr compared with the N-terminal benzyloxycarbonyl group. A study by Serrano et al.(29Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 465-475Google Scholar) revealed that aromatic-aromatic interactions in protein structures can contribute between 0.6 and 1.3 kcal/mol to protein stability. This effect is due to a quadrupole-quadrupole interaction between the aromatic rings, for which there is an associated potential energy that varies as 1/r5 (where r is the quadrupole separation distance)(30Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Trends Biotechnol. 1989; 7: 354-359Google Scholar). Therefore, any binding energy that is contributed by aromatic side chains of substrates or inhibitors interacting with aromatics on enzymes would be very sensitive to the distance between the groups. The P3 Arg modeling study (Fig. 3) reveals that the methylene groups of the arginyl side chain are somewhat further from Gly73 (4.3 Å) and Tyr75 (4.4 Å) than the other modeled substrates, suggesting that a van der Waals interaction is unlikely. The guanidinium group of the P3 Arg appears to form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl of Tyr75 (3.0 Å) and the carboxyl oxygen of Asp69 (2.7 Å) and, possibly, a weak hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Asn72 (3.4 Å). As discussed before, the kinetic data suggest that if there is an interaction between the guanidinium moiety of the P3 Arg and the carboxylate of Asp69, there is no significant net gain in binding energy. Considering the fact that there would be a significant energy cost involved in desolvating the guanidinium cation and that this interaction would be completely solvent-exposed, it may be reasonable to expect that there may not be any significant gain in binding energy for this charge-charge interaction. Therefore, the 4-fold increase in specificity observed for a P3 Arg, relative to Gly, may be due instead to the charge-neutral hydrogen bonds involving the substrate guanidinium and the hydroxyl of Tyr75 and possibly the carbonyl of Asn72. The modeling study for the substrates containing either a protonated or deprotonated Glu (Fig. 4 and 5) shows that the side chain methylene carbons of Glu make van der Waals contacts with the Cα of Gly73 (3.2 Å) and the phenyl ring of Tyr75 (3.6 Å). The kinetic data show that kcat/Km drops 20-fold when the P3 Glu deprotonates. One possible explanation of this significant destabilization of binding may be a charge-charge repulsion between Asp69 and the P3 side chain carboxylate, which are about 4.4 Å apart. Since the potential energy of charge-charge interactions varies as 1/r (where r is the charge separation), they can be manifested over relatively large distances. In fact, the modeling study with the deprotonated Glu shows the Asp69 side chain moving away from the P3 carboxylate relative to the Asp69 side chain position in the modeling studies with the other substrates. Another possible explanation, however, may be that there is a repulsion between the π-electron cloud of Tyr75 and the negative charge on the substrate side chain (30Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Trends Biotechnol. 1989; 7: 354-359Google Scholar). To summarize, the substrate binding in the S3 subsite of cathepsin B is largely due to contacts with the phenyl ring of Tyr75 and to a lesser extent may involve the Cα of Gly73. Additionally, hydrogen bonds involving the Tyr75 hydroxyl and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn72 may also make a contribution to substrate stabilization. The best substrate among the tripeptides tested has tyrosine at P3, which in comparison with the reference substrate containing glycine, has an increase in binding energy of 1.5 kcal/mol. Although these findings are significant for inhibitor design strategies, it may be useful to examine further the S3 specificity of cathepsin B with substrates containing residues such as tryptophan, phenylalanine, proline, methionine, leucine, and isoleucine at the P3 position. The study of these additional residues would provide a more complete understanding of the S3 specificity pocket. Extension of such a study to S4-P4 interactions will contribute additional information for the design of more specific inhibitors. We are indebted to A. Szabo for the use of his laboratory facilities and to A. Wigg for assistance."

Here we report the existence of a biochemical mechanism for the induction of neuronal death by an endogenous nucleoside in the presence of NGF. In support of such a mechanism we show that 2-deoxyadenosine (dAdo) induces apoptosis in chick embryonic sympathetic neurons supported in culture by NGF, excess K+, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, or forskolin. Neuronal death was related to a dramatic increase in the dATP content of sympathetic neurons exposed to dAdo (34.96 ± 5.98 versus 0.75 ± 0.16 pmol/μg protein in untreated controls, n = 9), implicating dATP in the toxicity. Supportive evidence for a central role of dATP was gained by inhibition of kinases necessary for phosphorylation of dAdo. 5′-Iodotubercidin in nanomolar concentrations completely and dose-dependently inhibited formation of dATP and also protected against toxicity of submillimolar concentrations of dAdo in sympathetic neurons. Although some of these actions of dAdo were remarkably similar to those reported for human lymphoid cells, several were uniquely different. For example, [3H]dAdo was not transported into neurons by the nucleoside transporter, and therefore inhibition of the transporter (dilazep, nitrobenzylthioinosine) did not prevent neurotoxicity by dAdo. Precursors of pyrimidine synthesis (2′-deoxycytidine, uridine) or NAD+ synthesis (nicotinamide) were ineffective in protecting sympathetic neurons against dAdo toxicity. Finally, inhibition of adenosine deaminase by deoxycoformycin or erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine did not potentiate the toxic effects of dAdo.

The nucleoside is highly toxic to human lymphocytes and is responsible for dysfunction of the immune system(1Giblett E.R. Anderson J.E. Cohen F. Pollara B. Meuwissen H.J. Lancet. 1972; ii: 1067-11069Google Scholar, 2Carson D.A. Kaye J. Seegmiller J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5677-5681Google Scholar, 3Cohen A. Hirschhorn R. Horowitz S.D. Rubinstein A.

Chem. 1978; 253: 1619-1626Google Scholar). Normally, dAdo derived from degraded DNA and dietary sources is rapidly metabolized by adenosine deaminase (ADA) in lymphoid and other tissues. However, in the absence of ADA, as in a genetic disorder responsible for SCIDS, the concentration of dAdo increases in blood and tissues (5Hershfield M.S. Kredich N.M. Ownby D.R. Ownby H. Buckley R. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 807-811Google Scholar, 6Hirschhorn R. Roegner V. Rubinstein A. Papageorgiou P. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 768-771Google Scholar) to induce a wide range of toxicities. Numerous studies have employed in vitro models to examine the mechanism of lethal actions of nucleosides in lymphocytes, lymphoblasts, fibroblasts, HeLa cells, and other cell types(7Tattersall M.H. Ganeshaguru K. Hoffbrand A.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 1495-1498Google Scholar, 8Ullman B. Cohen A. Martin D.W. Cell. 1976; 9: 205-211Google Scholar, 9Kaukel E. Fuhrmann U. Hilz H. Biochem.

One of the consistent observations was the enhancement of dAdo toxicity after treatment of cells with the ADA inhibitor deoxycoformycin, establishing a link between clinical and biochemical findings(11Snyder F.F. Mendelsohn J. Seegmiller J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 654-666Google Scholar). 2-deoxyadenosine severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome adenosine deaminase nerve growth factor phosphate-buffered saline nitrobenzyl thioinosine 5′-iodotubercidin. Clinical reports indicate that SCIDS also affects neurological function in children(12Polmar S.H. Stern R.C. Schwartz A.L. Wetzler E.M. Chase P.A. Hirschhorn R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 295: 13437-13443Google Scholar, 13Hirschhorn R. Papageorgiou P.S. Kesarwala H.H. Taft L.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 303: 377-380Google Scholar). Furthermore, life-threatening disorders of the central nervous system, as well as hepatic, renal, and respiratory functions, have been encountered in patients receiving ADA inhibitors as immunosuppressants(14Yu A.L. Bakay B. Kung F.H. Nyhan W.L. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2677-2682Google Scholar). However, unlike the extensive studies carried out on cultured lymphoid cells to improve understanding of immune function in ADA-deficient patients, there are no parallel reports on the effects of dAdo on neuronal systems. Primary culture of post-mitotic sympathetic neurons derived from paravertebral ganglia of chick embryo has proved to be a useful model to study a variety of neuronal properties including the toxicities of β-amyloid and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium(15Roher A.E. Ball M.J. Bhave S.V. Wakade A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 572-579Google Scholar, 16Bhave S.V. Johannsson J. Wakade A.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Therefore, we selected this model to evaluate the effects of dAdo and other agents on neuronal survival and growth in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) and other trophic agents. Sympathetic neurons were obtained from paravertebral, lumbosacral ganglia of 11-day-old chick embryos and prepared for cultures as described(17Wakade A.R. Edgar D. Thoenen H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1983; 144: 377-384Google Scholar). Neurons were plated in 35-mm plastic culture dishes or glass coverslips for fluorescence staining coated with polylysine (100 μg/ml for 3-4 h) containing 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin and transferrin, 0.5% chick embryo extract, and 50 ng/ml NGF. In some experiments, NGF was replaced by other neurotrophic factors, as described under “Results.” About 10,000 neurons were plated for morphological studies. The cell number was increased to about 80,000/plastic dish for biochemical assays. The number of surviving neurons was quantified by scanning along a strip with an area of 1/24th of the total surface of the culture dish using a Nikon Diaphot phase-contrast microscope (×100). Generally, neurons with refractory cell bodies and neurites of at least 3-4 times the length of cell bodies were considered as live cells. However, several treatments arrested the neurite growth without killing the cell bodies (trypan blue-negative) within the first 18-24 h, and caused cell body disintegration (ethidium bromide-positive) in the next 24-48 h. The fluorescent dye, 2′-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-2,5′-bi-1H-benzimidazole trihydrochloride pentahydrate (bisbenzimide, Hoechst 33258; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used to visualize the morphological features of nuclei in chick neuronal cultures. Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C, treated with bisbenzimide (1 μg/ml) in PBS for 15 min at 22°C, and washed twice with PBS. Coverslips were mounted with an anti-bleaching fluorescence medium and viewed under UV light using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Detection of apoptosis was performed by direct immunofluorescence staining using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides incorporated into DNA fragments by 3′-OH end extension (TUNEL) using an “Apotag” Kit (Oncor Inc.). Neuronal cultures on glass coverslips were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 22°C. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS (5 min each) and subsequently treated according to protocols provided by Oncor. Cells were counter-stained by mounting the coverslips with propidium iodide (0.5 μg/ml) in anti-bleaching fluorescence mounting medium and viewed as described above. Freshly plated neurons were used about 1 h after they were firmly attached. 2 μCi of [3H]dAdo (specific activity 28.4 Ci/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) was directly added to the medium (1 ml) and dishes were maintained at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for various times. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors (3 μM dilazep or 10 μM nitrobenzyl thioinosine (NBTI)) for 30 min prior to addition of [3H]dAdo. For competition studies, 100 μM unlabeled dAdo or adenosine was added with [3H]dAdo. For temperature studies, dishes were placed on ice for 15 min and then [3H]dAdo added to study uptake at 4°C. After each specified time point, cells were washed 3-4 times with ice-cold Krebs solution and finally extracted in 1.0 ml of ice-cold 0.6% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, a portion of the supernatant was used for measurement of total radioactivity ([3H]dAdo plus 3H-labeled metabolites) in a scintillation counter and the pellet was saved for protein analysis. Radioactivity retained by the neurons during each incubation was expressed as cpm/μg protein. Uptake and retention of [3H]adenosine was measured similarly, using 2 μCi of [3H]adenosine/ml of medium (specific activity 30.4 Ci/mmol). dATP content was determined using the synthesis of radiolabeled poly(dA-T) with dATP as the limiting factor(18Solter A.W. Handschumacher R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 174: 585-590Google Scholar). Neurons from 2 culture dishes were extracted on ice in 250 μl of 0.4% perchloric acid. Extracts were neutralized with KOH and precipitate removed by centrifugation. A portion of the extract was used for protein determination. 100 μl of extract (or dATP standard) was added to 100 μl of reaction mixture (200 mM glycine-NaOH, pH 9.2, 20 mM MgCl2, 100 μM TTP, 0.075 units of polydeoxyadenylic-thymidilic acid, and 0.0025 μCi of [3H]TTP (specific activity 103.9 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN). The reaction was started by addition of 100 μl (1 unit) of DNA polymerase and all tubes incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped and poly(dA-T) precipitated by addition of 5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration (0.45-μm filters). Filters were washed 4 times with about 2 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and transferred to vials for scintillation counting. Concentration of dATP in the sample was determined from a standard curve of counts/min from reactions run with known concentrations of dATP. The protein pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of 1 N NaOH for protein estimation as described previously(19Schacterle G.R. Pollack R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 51: 654-655Google Scholar). In all cases, cultures treated with dAdo and/or other agents were compared to matched, untreated control cultures. Data are presented as means ± S.E. and differences compared using Student's t test (two group comparisons) with p < 0.01 significant. NGF-supported cultures of sympathetic neurons showed inhibitory effects of dAdo on neurite extension as early as 6-8 h (Fig. 1). Photomicrographs in Fig. 2 demonstrate that 300 μM dAdo completely arrested neurite outgrowth from almost all the neurons within the first 24 h when they were maintained in the presence of NGF (Fig. 2B). In the next 24 h, the cell bodies of the neurons disintegrated in the presence of dAdo (Fig. 2D) whereas the untreated neurons showed the normal, extensive neuritic growth (Fig. 2, A and C). Inhibition of neurite growth and subsequent death was concentration-dependent and maximal at 300 μM (Fig. 3A). Related compounds such as 2-deoxyguanosine, guanosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine at concentrations up to 500 μM did not affect neuronal growth and survival (not shown).Figure 2:2′-deoxyadenosine-induced apoptosis in sympathetic neurons.

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Google Scholar), and dAdo is an endogenous product of DNA turnover and may reach high levels under pathological conditions (2Carson D.A. Kaye J. Seegmiller J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5677-5681Google Scholar, 3Cohen A. Hirschhorn R. Horowitz S.D. Rubinstein A. Polmar S.H. Hong R. Martin Jr., D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 472-476Google Scholar) we questioned whether dAdo could induce apoptosis in neurons. Apoptosis was identified using two methods. The nuclear dye bisbenzimide was used to detect condensation of nuclear chromatin(21Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Google Scholar). Bisbenzimide produced faint and diffuse fluorescence from untreated control neurons (Fig. 2E), but after dAdo treatment the fluorescence was more intense and punctate, indicating condensation of the chromatin material (Fig. 2, F and G). The other method used is specific for detecting neucleosomal breaks in DNA where 3-OH ends of DNA fragments bind to digoxigenin-conjugated nucleotides to produce a characteristic yellow-green fluorescence. Several of the remaining cells after dAdo treatment show the characteristic apoptotic type fluorescence (Fig. 2I), whereas almost all neurons grown in control medium were negative for fragmented DNA (Fig. 2H). Cells showing apoptotic type fluorescence were counted in control and dAdo-treated cultures. Neurons positive for apoptosis represented less than 1% of the population in control cultures compared to 31% in dAdo-treated cultures. Although NGF deprivation is known to produce apoptotic death of sympathetic neurons, dAdo-mediated toxicity was not a consequence of blockade of the actions of NGF at the receptor level or along its intracellular signaling pathway because neurons supported in culture by a diverse group of neurotrophic agents were also sensitive to the lethal effects of dAdo (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Compared to adenosine, dAdo is virtually inert in terms of its ability to activate membrane nucleoside receptors to influence the intracellular cAMP signaling system. Therefore, we considered the possibility of an intracellular site of action in apoptosis. When freshly plated neurons were incubated with [3H]dAdo (2 μCi/ml medium, specific activity 28.4 Ci/mmol), retention of the label increased to a maximum by 10 min and remained near that level over the next 5 h (Fig. 3B). The uptake was remarkably less when compared to the accumulation of [3H]adenosine (2 μCi/ml medium, specific activity 30.4 Ci/mmol) after a 100-min incubation (3260 ± 849 versus 12470 ± 3200 cpm/μg protein, n = 10). Furthermore, classic inhibitors of the nucleoside transporter NBTI (10 μM) or dilazep (3 μM) blocked [3H]adenosine uptake by 87 ± 4% (n = 4), but had little or no effect on [3H]dAdo uptake (Fig. 3C). Unlabeled dAdo or adenosine (100 μM) caused only partial inhibition of [3H]dAdo uptake, and the uptake of [3H]dAdo was not sensitive to temperature. These results suggest that dAdo enters sympathetic neurons primarily by a passive process rather than by the nucleoside transporter. Consistent with the uptake data, inhibition of the nucleoside transporter (10 μM NBTI) did not protect neurons against dAdo-induced toxicity (Table 2). Toxic effects of dAdo in human lymphocytes and other cell types have been related to blockade of DNA synthesis or NAD synthesis, because dAdo toxicity is reversed by excess uridine or 2′-deoxycytidine or by excess nicotinamide to maintain NAD levels(22Henderson J.F. Scott F.W. Lowe J.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1980; 8: 573-582Google Scholar, 23Seto S. Carrera C.J. Kubuto M. Wasson D.B. Carson D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 377-383Google Scholar). However, 100 μM 2′-deoxycytidine (Fig. 4A) or 3 mM nicotinamide (Fig. 4B) did not prevent the lethal action of dAdo on neurons. Higher concentrations of 2′-deoxycytidine or nicotinamide or up to 300 μM uridine also failed to protect neurons exposed to 300 μM dAdo (Table 2).TABLE II Open table in a new tab Deoxycoformycin and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine are potent inhibitors of ADA (24Agarwal R.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1982; 17: 399-430Google Scholar) used to mimic immunodeficiency syndrome in experimental models(11Snyder F.F. Mendelsohn J. Seegmiller J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 654-666Google Scholar, 25Johnson J.M. Kredich N.M. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 97-103Google Scholar). However, neither erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine nor deoxycoformycin modified the toxic effects of dAdo in our neuronal model (Table 3; see also Fig. 3A). These results are significantly different from those reported for human lymphocytes and several other cell lines commonly used in cancer research, and raise an important question about the metabolic disposition of dAdo in sympathetic neurons as compared to other types of cells (see below).TABLE III Open table in a new tab Since inhibition of adenosine deaminase did not facilitate the toxic effects of dAdo and since agents that protect against dAdo toxicity in other cells were without effect, we considered the possibility that nucleoside kinases might play a major role in the metabolism of dAdo in sympathetic neurons. 5′-Iodotubercidin (ITu), an inhibitor of adenosine kinase(26Hurley M.C. Lin B. Fox I.H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 195: 141-149Google Scholar), was used to test this idea. Remarkably, as little as 0.1 nM ITu offered some protection (Fig. 4C), and 3 nM ITu almost completely blocked the lethal effects of 300 μM dAdo (Fig. 4D). This effect was not due to blockade of dAdo transport, because as high as 3 μM ITu had no effect on [3H]dAdo accumulation in sympathetic neurons (not shown). The above experiments strongly suggest that the most efficient metabolic pathway for dAdo may be phosphorylation to dATP which could then be responsible for dAdo-induced arrest of neurite growth, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. In support of such a mechanism, we found a more than 40-fold increase in dATP content of neurons within 2 h of exposure to 300 μM dAdo (34.96 ± 5.98 versus 0.75 ± 0.16 pmol of dATP/μg of protein in treated and control cultures, respectively, n = 9). The formation of dATP from dAdo was both time-dependent (Fig. 5A) and concentration-dependent (Fig. 5B) with maximum dATP levels achieved following incubation with 100 μM dAdo. The elevation of intracellular dATP was dose-dependently and almost completely blocked (83 ± 1%) by 3 nM ITu (Fig. 5C), consistent with the dose-dependent protective action of ITu against dAdo toxicity. These data support the idea that sympathetic neurons rapidly phosphorylate intracellularly accumulated dAdo to its toxic product. The lethal effects of dAdo were extensively studied over the past 20 years exclusively in blood cells, and our report shows that neuronal cells are equally susceptible to this endogenous nucleoside. This dramatic parallel is as impressive as the differences in the way the nucleoside is metabolized by the two types of cells. The most noticeable differences were the absence of a specific carrier or transport mechanism for the nucleoside in the plasma membrane, a minor role of adenosine deaminase, and the inability of nicotinamide and pyrimidines to reverse the dAdo toxicity in neurons. Whether neuronal cells have adopted these diversities to safeguard against the toxicity of the nucleoside or have acquired a unique nucleoside metabolic pathway for maintaining their populations is an intriguing question. Sympathetic neurons differ from non-neuronal cells, which are protected against dAdo toxicity by inhibitors of nucleoside transport (27Mitchell B.S. Mejias E. Daddona P.E. Kelley W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5011-5015Google Scholar) and by mutations resulting in lack of transporter expression(28Ullman B. Gudas L.J. Cohen A. Martin Jr., D.W. Cell. 1978; 14: 365-375Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of protection against dAdo toxicity by nucleoside transport inhibitors, the uptake of [3H]dAdo was also unaffected by these agents. Furthermore, [3H]dAdo uptake was substantially lower than that of [3H]adenosine, only slightly affected by competition with unlabeled adenosine or dAdo, and insensitive to temperature, supporting the idea that dAdo is not carried by the classic nucleoside transporter. Finding that adenosine but not dAdo accumulates in sympathetic neurons via an NBTI sensitive transporter is distinctly different from nucleoside transport properties in other cell types where adenosine and dAdo enter via a similar mechanism. Although at least five different nucleoside transporters have been identified in mammalian cells(29Belt J.A. Marina N.M. Phelps D.A. Crawford C.R. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1993; 33: 235-252Google Scholar), the kinetics and inhibitor sensitivity of transport have been reported to be the same for adenosine and dAdo in a variety of systems, including leukemia cell lines(30Plagemann P.G. Wohlhueter R.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 6418-6424Google Scholar, 31Crawford C.R. Ng C.Y. Belt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13730-13734Google Scholar), human erythrocytes(32Plagemann P.G. Aran J.M. Wohlhueter R.M. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1022: 103-109Google Scholar), and fibroblast lysosomes (33Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4850-4856Google Scholar). Regardless of the exact mechanism of dAdo uptake, we have demonstrated rapid accumulation of very high levels of dATP within 1-8 h of exposure to dAdo. This was associated with complete arrest of neurite growth even though neuronal soma appeared viable. Neuronal death and evidence of apoptosis were prominent after 24-48 h. These findings are consistent with those showing that neurite degeneration and somatic apoptosis are independent events in sympathetic neurons deprived of NGF (34Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 63-72Google Scholar) and suggest that dAdo may exert its toxicity by more than one mechanism. Data showing that inhibition of nucleoside kinases by nanomolar concentrations of Itu not only blocked dATP formation but also completely protected neurons against toxicity of 300 μM dAdo, offer strong evidence relating dATP formation to neuronal toxicity and death. However, there was a discrepancy between the concentration of dAdo needed to produce maximum elevation of dATP (≈100 μM, Fig. 5B) and that needed to produce maximum cell death (≈300 μM, Fig. 1A). This, plus the finding that dATP levels increased almost immediately while cell death took 24-48 h, supports the idea that factors other than dATP may be involved in dAdo toxicity. Studies are in progress to determine the chronological order of cell growth arrest, ATP and dATP content, RNA and protein synthesis, and changes in the mRNA levels of protooncogenes considered to play a role in neuronal apoptosis. Disturbance of nucleoside metabolism by arabinofuranosyl nucleoside antimetabolites (e.g. cytosine arabinoside) has been shown to produce apoptosis in sympathetic neurons(35Martin D.P. Wallace T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 184-193Google Scholar, 36Tomkins C.E. Edwards S.N. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1499-1507Google Scholar), and analogues of cyclic nucleotides rescue sympathetic neurons from apoptosis following NGF withdrawal(21Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Google Scholar, 37Edwards S.N. Buckmaster A.E. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 2140-2143Google Scholar). The present findings show for the first time that an endogenous nucleoside is also capable of inducing apoptotic death in sympathetic neurons in the presence of NGF or other diverse factors capable of supporting survival of sympathetic neurons in culture(38Wakade A.R. Wakade T.D. Malhotra R.K. Bhave S.V. J. Neurochem. 1988; 57: 975-983Google Scholar, 39Wakade A.R. Bhave S.V. Malhotra R.K. Wakade T.D. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1281-1287Google Scholar). The extraordinary protection afforded by nanomolar concentrations of ITu against submillimolar concentrations of dAdo and the lack of effect of ADA inhibitors indicate that the primary fate of dAdo in sympathetic neurons is phosphorylation rather than deamination. Whether nucleoside kinase or deaminase activities change during development to serve as a positive or negative signal for neuronal survival remains to be established. In any event, our study draws attention to the importance of purine and pyrimidine metabolism in a neuronal system in maintaining growth and survival. Understanding of these metabolic pathways may provide important insights to mechanisms involved in modeling the nervous system during development as well as in neurodegenerative disease. Johnson and colleagues (21Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Google Scholar, 40Martin D.P. Schmidt R.E. DiStefano P.S. Lowry O.H. Carter J.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 829-844Google Scholar) and others (41Edwards S.N. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 537-546Google Scholar) have obtained extensive evidence to establish that sympathetic neurons undergo a programmed cell death that requires protein synthesis as well as mRNA synthesis and is accompanied by nuclear DNA fragmentation. While the majority of these studies are related to the inhibition of programmed cell death by NGF, it has been suggested that cytokines may regulate sympathetic neurons by initiating programmed death(42Kesler J.A. Ludlam W.H. Freidin M.M. Hall D.H. Michaelson M.D. Spray D.C. Dougherty M. Batter D.K. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1123-1132Google Scholar). We have presented evidence that a deoxynucleoside is also able to initiate apoptosis in sympathetic neurons in the presence of NGF. Thus, neurons appear to have two or more apoptotic mechanisms to regulate their population, either limited supply of a protective factor (NGF) or an excess of initiating nucleosides. It is tempting to speculate that one or both of these pathways could be active during development or pathologic neurodegeneration."

The Hb was prepared as described previously(7Suzuki T. Furukohri T. Gotoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3145-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dialyzed against distilled, deionized water, lyophilized, and stored at −70°C. Carbamidomethylation with iodoacetamide was carried out under the same conditions as carboxymethylation(10Crestfield A.M. Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 239: 622-627Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar); upon termination of the reaction, the protein was thoroughly dialyzed against distilled, deionized water and lyophilized. ESI-MS data were acquired on a VG Quattro II electrospray mass spectrometer (VG Organic, Altrincham, Cheshire, UK), using sample concentrations of 0.5 μg/μl in 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.2% formic acid. The sample flow rate into the electrospray source was 5 μl/min, and data were typically acquired for 5-10 min while scanning over the m/z range 600- 2500 at 10 s/scan. The cone voltage (sample orifice to skimmer potential) ramp was employed to optimize sensitivity over the m/z range scanned. ESI-MS produces a series of multiply charged ions on the m/z scale from each protein in the sample. On this scale, m/z = (M + nH)/n, where M is the mass of the protein, H is the mass of the proton, and n is a series of consecutive integers. Since the Hb data arise from several proteins, each producing a series of 5-10 multiply charged ions, they were processed in order to condense each series into a single peak on a true molecular mass scale. Processing used a maximum entropy (MaxEnt)-based approach (11Ferrige A.G. Seddon M.J. Jarvis S.A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 5: 374-379Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Ferrige A.G.

The multiply charged series from horse heart Mb (Sigma), mass of 16,951.5 Da(13Zaia J. Annan R.S. Biemann K. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), was used for mass scale calibration. The masses are based on the following atomic weights of the elements: C = 12.011, H = 1.00794, n = 14.00674, O = 15.9994, and S = 32.066(14IUPAC Commission on Atomic Weights and Isotopic AbundancesJ.

ESI-MS analyses were made on the native Hb (three determinations), the reduced and carbamidomethylated Hb (two determinations), and on the native Hb after exposure to DTT for 10, 30, and 60 min (one determination each). Fig. 1A shows the raw, multiply charged spectrum of the native Hb and Fig. 1B the corresponding MaxEnt processed spectrum. Fig. 1, C and D, shows the MaxEnt processed spectra of the native Hb partially reduced with DTT (after 30 min) and of the reduced and carbamidomethylated Hb, respectively. Table 1, Table 2 present the measured and calculated masses of the constituent chains and subunits of Tylorrhynchus Hb and compare the experimental values with those calculated from the known amino acid sequences.Table 2 Open table in a new tab There are four globin chains; of these IIA, IIB, and IIC have measured reduced masses (Table 1) that are within experimental error (±1.0 Da) of the reduced masses calculated from their known sequences(4Suzuki T.

Chem. 1985; 260: 11481-11487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chain I, representing the monomer subunit, has an ESI-MS mass of 15,575.4 Da, 127.5 Da higher than the sequence mass (6Suzuki T. Takagi T. Gotoh T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 708: 253-259Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) assuming one disulfide bond. The simplest explanation for the discrepancy is that the sequence should contain an extra Gln (128.1 Da) or Lys (128.2 Da). Surprisingly, chain I is observed in the native (Fig. 1B) and reduced native Hb (Fig. 1C) but not in the carbamidomethylated Hb (Fig. 1D). An additional monomer component, 15592 Da, is observed in the native Hb (Fig. 1B) and reduced Hb (Fig. 1C). The 16.5-Da difference is within the range found for many protein adducts in ESI-MS (see discussion below).Table 1 Open table in a new tab The ESI-MS results exhibit good agreement between the measured mass of the trimer subunit (chains IIA + IIB + IIC), 50068.4 ± 1.7 Da (mean ± S.D. of 3 determinations), and the sum of the masses of its component chains, 50066.2 Da (Table 2). Furthermore, the results confirm the number of Cys residues found in the three chains and the finding that the trimer contains 3 intrachain (one within each chain) and 2 interchain disulfide bonds IIA-IIC-IIB(15Suzuki T. Kapp O.H. Gotoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18524-18529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The linker chains L1 and L2, whose sequences have been determined(9Suzuki T. Takagi T. Gotoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12168-12177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are not detected as such in the ESI-MS of native Hb. Only a disulfide-bonded dimer (L2)2 is found at 52609.4 Da (S.D. ± 0.2 Da; estimated maximum error ± 4.0 Da). The measured reduced mass of L2 derived from the carbamidomethylated Hb data is 26317.2 Da (27001.8 − 12 × 57.052) agrees, within experimental error, with the reduced sequence mass (26316.2 Da) (Table 1). Furthermore, using the measured value and assuming that, of the 12 Cys present, only 1 is involved in interchain disulfide bonding, the calculated mass of the dimer, (L2)2− 22H = 52612.2 Da, is 2.8 Da higher than the mass of the dimer measured directly, 52609.4 Da, within the estimated experimental error of ±4.0 Da (Table 2). The measured reduced mass of linker L1 derived from the carbamidomethylated Hb data is 28886.8 − 12 × 57.052 = 28202.2 Da (estimated maximum error ± 2.0 Da) in agreement with the sequence mass (28200.5 Da) within the experimental error. However, a dimer of L1 was not detected in the ESI-MS of native Hb. Comparison of the results obtained with DTT-reduced Hb and with carbamidomethylated Hb, confirms that L1 and L2 each contain 12 Cys (Table 1). In addition to the foregoing linkers, the ESI-MS results provide evidence for the possible existence of three, hitherto undetected linker chains, L3, 25326.9 Da, L4 (minor), 24835.4 Da, and L5, 23233.8 Da, with L3 and L5 containing 10 Cys (Table 1). However, the masses of these putative linkers and the number of Cys residues therein are consistent with their being degradation products of L1 and L2. Thus, cleavage of L1 at Arg28-Ser29 and Asp33-Pro34 would provide fragments 29-253 (25325.3 Da) and 34-253 (24833.8 Da) whose masses are within experimental error of the masses of L3 and L4, 25326.9 Da and 24835.4 Da, respectively (Table 1). Cleavage of L2 at Ala29-Gly30 would give a fragment of 23232.7 Da to be compared with L5 23233.8 Da (Table 1). It should be noted that the Asp-Pro peptide bond is known to be labile in acid solution (16Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and in the gas phase(17Yu W. Vath J.E. Huberty M.C. Martin S.A. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 3015-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A referee has pointed out that although cleavage at the Arg-Ser bond is also possible, the Ala-Gly cleavage of L2 is highly improbable. A weakness of the ESI-MS method can be the formation of “adducts” of the proteins under examination. (i) Adducts with Na+ and K+ (22 and 38 Da higher in mass) occur widely(18Senko M.W. McLafferty F.W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 763-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). (ii) Adducts of protein with heme (616.5 Da), such as heme-apomyoglobin, have been observed(19Loo J.A. Giordani A.B. Muenster H. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 186-189Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). (iii) Adducts with an increase in mass of 16-18 Da, which may be products of oxidation or hydroxylation are also encountered. Such a mass difference between two forms of bovine seminal RNase monomer, 13,733 Da and 13,749 Da, was ascribed recently to the oxidation of a Cys sulfhydryl to a sulfinic acid (-SOH)(20Kim J.S. Raines R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A mass difference of +16-18 Da will not be resolved from +22 Da; hence, depending on the relative intensities of its component(s), the peak(s) around +16-22 Da may be of indeterminate mass and multiple origins. (iv) Components of +98 Da have been observed with many proteins from natural sources(21Chowdhury S.K. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 1: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) : they are believed to be adducts of either phosphoric or sulfuric acid. Examples of these adducts can be seen among many of the lesser peaks in Fig. 1. These phenomena make it imperative to examine a given protein in more than one form. The results described above provide what appears to be a complete and self-consistent description of the subunit and polypeptide chain composition of Tylorrhynchus Hb. In addition to validating the sequences of three of the four globin chains and two linker chains, it demonstrates the presence of three additional linkers and provides a semiquantitative estimate of the relative proportions of the component chains. Based on the latter, an updated and plausible version of the quaternary structure proposed earlier (22Suzuki T. Gotoh T. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) can be calculated as shown in Table 3; the resulting calculated mass of 3.42 MDa is very close to the sedimentation equilibrium mass of 3.38 MDa(4Suzuki T. Gotoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 257-9267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table 3 Open table in a new tab The foregoing results present a striking illustration of MaxEnt processing of ESI-MS data to obtain the complete resolution of all the chains/subunits of a large, heteromultimeric protein complex (similar in size to a ribosome), generally one of the more intractable problems in biochemistry.

Cells containing either construct produced heme, although the amount of heme synthesized by cells with the truncated construct was significantly less. Interestingly in cells with improperly localized ferrochelatase the amount of b-type cytochrome decreased by 80% as opposed to c- and a-type cytochromes where the decreases were only 60 and 40%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1559929999,"We have characterized the regulation of the endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger in Xenopus laevis oocytes by G proteins and protein kinases by measuring the ethylisopropylamiloride-sensitive Li+ uptake. Injection of oocytes with the stable GTP analog GTPγS stimulated Li+ uptake up to almost 4-fold, an effect blocked by coinjection with the GDP analog, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate. Injection into oocytes of βγ subunits of the heterotrimeric G protein transducin enhanced Li+ uptake by about 3-fold. This stimulation was blocked by transducin α subunits, which by themselves did not influence Li+ uptake. Using various activators and inhibitors of protein kinases, it is demonstrated that the X. laevis oocyte Na+/H+ antiporter can be stimulated by activation of both protein kinase A and C. Stimulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity by GTPγS but not that induced by transducin βγ subunits was blocked by the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89. On the other hand, transducin βγ subunit-stimulated activity was prevented by the protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C. The non-selective protein kinase inhibitor H-7 blocked both GTPγS- and transducin βγ subunit-stimulated Na+/H+ exchanger activity. The results suggest that the Na+/H+ exchanger of X. laevis oocytes can be activated by G proteins and that this activation is not direct but mediated by protein kinase A- and/or protein kinase C-dependent pathways.

Rotin D. Mason M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 73-97Google Scholar). The NHE-1 isoform is ubiquitously expressed and mainly serves intracellular pH and cell volume regulation(2Counillon L.

The expression of the other hitherto cloned mammalian isoforms, referred to as NHE-2-NHE-4, appears more restricted to the apical membranes of epithelial cells, and their role could reside in mediating transepithelial Na+ transport (2Counillon L. Pouyssgur J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 2: 138-149Google Scholar, 3Wakabayashi S. Sardet C. Fafournoux P. Counillon L. Meloche S. Pags G. Pouyssgur J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

These isoforms differ with respect to their inhibition by amiloride and its analogs (6Counillon L. Scholz W. Lang H.J. Pouyssgur J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1041-1045Google Scholar) and with regard to their regulation by intracellular second messengers. For example, the activity of the NHE-1 and NHE-2 expressed in fibroblast PS120 cells is increased by protein kinase C (PKC)-activating phorbol esters, whereas the activity of the NHE-3 is reduced by this treatment(7Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that the NHE-1 belongs to the family of calmodulin-binding proteins, which is activated by a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration(8Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssgur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Google Scholar, 9Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Ikeda T. Pouyssgur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13710-13715Google Scholar). Variable effects of cAMP on mammalian NHE activity have been reported. Upon expression of NHE-1, NHE-2, and NHE-3 in PS120 cells, no effect of cAMP on these isoforms was found(7Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Google Scholar). On the other hand, when studied in their natural environment, both inhibition and stimulation of NHE activity by cAMP have been reported (10Helmle-Kolb C. Montrose M.H. Stange G. Murer H. Pflgers Arch. 1990; 415: 461-470Google Scholar, 11Green J. Kleeman C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C111-C121Google Scholar, 12Gupta A. Schwiening C.J. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1083-C1092Google Scholar). This variability may be due to the cell type studied and/or the NHE isoform expressed in these cells. The βNHE isoform cloned from trout red blood cells unambiguously differs from the mammalian isoforms as this exchanger is phosphorylated and activated by both PKC and protein kinase A (PKA)(13Borgese F. Sardet C. Cappadoro M. Pouyssgur J. Motais R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6765-6769Google Scholar, 14Guizouarn H. Borgese F. Pellissier B. Garcia-Romeu F. Motais R. J. Biol.

Few information exists regarding the properties of the Na+/H+ exchanger expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes(16Towle D.W. Baksinski A. Richard N.E. Kordylewski M. J. Exp. Biol. 1991; 159: 359-369Google Scholar, 17Burckhardt B.-C. Kroll B. Frmter E. Pflgers Arch. 1992; 420: 78-82Google Scholar, 18Busch S. Burckhardt B.-C. Siffert W. Pflgers Arch. 1995; 429: 859-869Google Scholar). In a previous study, we expressed the human NHE-1 in X. laevis oocytes, which increased the exchanger activity above the endogenous oocyte NHE activity(18Busch S. Burckhardt B.-C. Siffert W. Pflgers Arch. 1995; 429: 859-869Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activity of the expressed NHE-1 was totally suppressed by low concentrations (100 nM) of the novel isoform-selective inhibitor HOE694(6Counillon L. Scholz W. Lang H.J. Pouyssgur J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1041-1045Google Scholar), whereas the endogenous NHE activity remained unaffected even in the presence of 100 μM of this compound. This pharmacological difference suggested that the functional characteristics of the X. laevis oocyte Na+/H+ exchanger may also be different from those of the mammalian transporters. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger of X. laevis oocytes by G proteins and protein kinases. The data presented here show that the oocyte antiporter can be activated by G proteins and that this regulation involves both PKA- and PKC-dependent mechanisms. All nucleotides were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Gentamycin, streptomycin, penicillin, calphostin C, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, forskolin, PKA inhibitor (type III from bovine heart), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were from Sigma. The protein kinase inhibitors, H-7 and H-89, and ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) were from Calbiochem. Sp-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate ((Sp)-cAMPS) was from Bio-Log (Bremen, Germany). Transducin α and βγ subunits were purified from illuminated bovine rod outer segments with GTP as activating nucleotide as previously described(19Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis from oligo(dT)-selected poly(A)+ RNA was carried out with 25 pmol of random primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). The single strand cDNA was then subjected to 30 cycles of PCR amplification (1 min, 94°C; 1 min, 48°C; 1.5 min, 72°C), using 10 pmol of two NHE-1- and βNHE-specific oligonucleotide primers encompassing the region between the putative transmembrane domains Va and VIII. The sequences of the primers were: sense 5′-GAATTCTCGGCCGTGGACCCCGTGGC-3′ (βNHE bp 667-686, NHE-1 bp 1110-1129) and antisense 5′-GAATTCCGCTCACGCTGCTCCACATC-3′ (βNHE bp 1135-1116, NHE-1 bp 1578-1559). Using the EcoRI endonuclease restriction sites of the 5′-ends of each primer, the amplification products were subcloned into the complementary restricted pBluescript SK+ plasmid (Stratagene) for sequence analysis. DNA sequencing was carried out using fluorescent nucleotides in an automatic sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Cytoplasmic injections into defolliculated X. laevis oocytes were performed as previously detailed(18Busch S. Burckhardt B.-C. Siffert W. Pflgers Arch. 1995; 429: 859-869Google Scholar). 50 nl of nucleotides or transducin subunits were injected to yield the indicated final intracellular concentrations, assuming a mean oocyte volume of 1 μl. After resealing of the plasma membrane, the oocytes were transferred to Li+-containing medium as described below. Some oocytes were incubated for 30 min in OR-2 medium containing 1 μCi of [3H]sorbitol (DuPont NEN), for which no endogenous transporter in X. laevis oocytes has been described. Oocytes were considered tight in the absence of any radioactivity above background after extensive washing. Na+/H+ antiporter activity was determined by measuring EIPA-sensitive Li+ uptake, i.e. Li+/H+-exchange, as described in detail previously(18Busch S. Burckhardt B.-C. Siffert W. Pflgers Arch. 1995; 429: 859-869Google Scholar). This method avoids the use of radioactive Na+. In brief, oocytes were incubated for various time periods within the linear range of Li+ uptake (18Busch S. Burckhardt B.-C. Siffert W. Pflgers Arch. 1995; 429: 859-869Google Scholar) in a medium containing 65 mM LiCl, 2.5 mM lithium citrate, 8 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM Mops, pH 7.4. Thereafter, the cells were removed from the medium, washed five times in ice-cold 0.1% (w/v) CsCl solution, and transferred to plastic tubes containing 1 ml of 0.1% (w/v) CsCl solution. After oocyte homogenization and removal of yolk proteins, lithium concentration was determined in the clear supernatant by analytical flame photometry using a Pye Unicam spectrophotometer SP9. Assuming a mean oocyte volume of 1 μl and after correcting for dilution, intracellular Li+ concentrations were calculated. Initial velocities of Na+/H+ exchanger activity are presented here in mmol of Li+/liter of oocyte and h. All data represent means ± S.D. performed on 10 oocytes from at least two different animals. Data were analyzed by Student's t-test, and differences were regarded significant at p < 0.05. To study whether the X. laevis oocyte Na+/H+ exchanger is regulated by G proteins, we first examined the effects of injected nucleotides (5 μM, final intracellular concentration) on Li+ uptake. Injection of the stable GTP analog GTPγS stimulated EIPA-sensitive Li+ uptake by almost 4-fold (Table 1). In contrast, GTP, the ATP analog ATPγS, and the GDP analog GDPβS had no or only slight effects on Li+ uptake. When GTPγS and GDPβS were injected simultaneously at a molar ratio of 1:100, the GTPγS-induced stimulation of Li+ uptake was completely suppressed. Thus, these data suggested that activated G proteins can enhance the X. laevis oocyte Na+/H+ exchanger activity.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Possible G protein regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity was additionally studied by injecting α and βγ subunits (1 μM, final concentration) of the retinal G protein transducin into oocytes. Whereas injected α subunits had no effect on Li+ uptake, injection of βγ subunits strongly increased EIPA-sensitive Li+ uptake by about 3-fold (Table 2). When α and βγ subunits were coinjected, no effect on Li+ uptake was observed. Thus, in addition to GTPγS, free βγ subunits of transducin can stimulate the X. laevis oocyte Na+/H+ exchanger.TABLE II Open table in a new tab To determine whether the stimulatory effects of GTPγS and transducin βγ subunits are due to a direct G protein activation of the X. laevis oocyte Na+/H+ antiporter or due to the formation of second messengers and consequently of second messenger-activated protein kinases, we first studied the possible regulation of Li+ uptake by directly activated PKC and PKA. Pretreatment of oocytes with the phorbol ester, PMA (10 nM), increased EIPA-sensitive Li+ uptake by almost 4-fold (Table 3). This stimulation was completely suppressed by the specific PKC inhibitor calphostin C (1 μM) (20Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Google Scholar) but only slightly reduced by H-89 (100 μM), a rather selective PKA inhibitor(21Hidaka H. Kobayashi R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 377-397Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the Na+/H+ exchanger expressed in X. laevis oocytes can be activated by a PKC-dependent mechanism.TABLE III Open table in a new tab To study whether the X. laevis oocyte Na+/H+ antiporter is also regulated by PKA, oocytes were treated with the direct PKA activator, (Sp)-cAMPS(22Rothermel J.D. Parker Bothelho L.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 757-762Google Scholar), and the direct adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin. Both agents strongly stimulated Li+ uptake. (Sp)-cAMPS increased Li+ uptake to 370, 450, and 470% of controls at 1, 10, and 100 μM, respectively (data not shown). Forskolin (100 μM) increased EIPA-sensitive Li+ uptake by 5-6-fold (Table 4). The stimulatory effect of forskolin was completely abolished in oocytes pretreated with the PKA inhibitor, H-89 (100 μM), or injected with the bovine heart PKA inhibitor (0.1 μM). In contrast, the PKC inhibitor, calphostin C (1 μM), had no effect on forskolin-stimulated Li+ uptake. Thus, the Na+/H+ exchanger expressed in X. laevis oocytes is apparently under the control of both PKC and PKA.TABLE IV Open table in a new tab The stimulation of X. laevis oocyte Na+/H+ exchanger by both PKA and PKC could be due to the expression of a NHE isoform resembling the βNHE, which is stimulated by both PKA and PKC, or to the expression of two distinct isoforms being differentially controlled by PKA and PKC. PCR analysis of cDNA synthesized from oocyte RNA with oligonucleotide primers homologous to both the human NHE-1 and the βNHE yielded one major reaction product of 417 bp. After subcloning of this PCR product, 10 different clones were analyzed, which all exhibited an identical nucleotide sequence, suggesting the expression of only one NHE transcript in these cells. Sequence comparison with corresponding sequences of the human NHE-1 and the βNHE indicated a 79 and 73% homology, respectively, on the nucleotide level, which was increased to 89 and 80%, respectively, on the amino acid level. Finally, we investigated whether protein kinases, specifically PKA and PKC, are involved in stimulation of the X. laevis Na+/H+ antiporter by GTPγS and transducin βγ subunits. Preincubation of oocytes with H-7 (100 μM), a non-selective protein kinase inhibitor(21Hidaka H. Kobayashi R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 377-397Google Scholar), completely suppressed Li+ uptake stimulated by either injected GTPγS or transducin βγ subunits (Fig. 1), suggesting the involvement of a protein kinase-dependent mechanism(s) in stimulation of Na+/H+ antiporter by either agent. On the other hand, the selective PKA inhibitor, H-89 (100 μM), strongly reduced Li+ uptake stimulated by GTPγS, whereas transducin βγ subunit-stimulated Li+ uptake was not affected. Vice versa, pretreatment of oocytes with calphostin C (1 μM) completely inhibited Li+ uptake stimulated by transducin βγ subunits but was without effect on stimulation by GTPγS. It is generally accepted that the phospholipase C-PKC pathway constitutes one route for NHE activation, with the notable exception of the NHE-3, which is inhibited by phorbol ester-activated PKC(7Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Google Scholar). On the other hand, data on regulation of mammalian Na+/H+ exchangers by PKA-dependent phosphorylation are rather variable, with no effects, inhibition, and stimulation being reported(7Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Google Scholar, 10Helmle-Kolb C. Montrose M.H. Stange G. Murer H. Pflgers Arch. 1990; 415: 461-470Google Scholar, 11Green J. Kleeman C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C111-C121Google Scholar, 12Gupta A. Schwiening C.J. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1083-C1092Google Scholar). The Na+/H+ antiporter cloned from trout red blood cells, βNHE, is activated by agents causing an increase in intracellular cAMP concentration and by direct PKA activators(13Borgese F. Sardet C. Cappadoro M. Pouyssgur J. Motais R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6765-6769Google Scholar, 14Guizouarn H. Borgese F. Pellissier B. Garcia-Romeu F. Motais R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8632-8639Google Scholar, 15Borgese F. Malapert M. Fievet B. Pouyssgur J. Motais R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5431-5435Google Scholar). The data presented herein indicate that the Na+/H+ exchanger expressed in X. laevis oocytes is stimulated by both PKC- and PKA-dependent mechanisms, thus resembling the regulation of the βNHE of trout red cells. In oocytes injected with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (0.01 units/oocyte), not only PMA- and forskolin-stimulated but also unstimulated Li+ uptake was reduced to about 50% of untreated controls (data not shown), suggesting that even basal transport activity is maintained by phosphorylation. A dual regulation of the X. laevis oocyte Na+/H+ exchanger was also observed by activating oocyte endogenous G proteins with GTPγS and by injecting G protein βγ subunits. Recently, evidence has been accumulated that βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins can directly activate phospholipase C, preferentially the β2 and β3 isoforms of this enzyme(23Camps M. Hou C. Sidiropoulos D. Stock J.B. Jakobs K.H. Gierschik P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 821-831Google Scholar, 24Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Lee K.-H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4573-4576Google Scholar), and a phospholipase C with homologies to the mammalian phospholipase C-β3 enzyme has been cloned from X. laevis oocytes(25Ma H.-W. Blitzer R.D. Healy E.C. Premont R.T. Landau E.M. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19915-19918Google Scholar). Transducin βγ subunits injected into X. laevis oocytes stimulated NHE activity, and this stimulation was prevented by coinjected α subunits, suggesting the stimulation being due to free βγ subunits. Similar data were reported for phospholipase C activation by transducin subunits(23Camps M. Hou C. Sidiropoulos D. Stock J.B. Jakobs K.H. Gierschik P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 821-831Google Scholar). However, due to the suppression by the protein kinase inhibitors, H-7 and calphostin C, the stimulatory effect of βγ subunits is unlikely due to a direct interaction with the oocyte NHE. We rather propose that upon injection of βγ subunits the oocyte phospholipase C is activated, resulting in the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and the subsequent activation of PKC, then activating directly or via additional kinases the oocyte Na+/H+ exchanger. Such a signal transduction cascade could be initiated in vivo via muscarinic or angiotensin II receptors, which, in oocytes, are coupled to phospholipase C via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins(26Van Wezenbeek L.A.C.M. Tonnaer J.A.D.M. Ruigt G.S.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 151: 497-500Google Scholar, 27Sakuta H. Sekiguchi M. Okamoto K. Sakai Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 208: 31-39Google Scholar, 28Blitzer R.D. Omri G. De Vivo M. Carty D.J. Premont R.T. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Cotecchia S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Landau E.M. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7532-7537Google Scholar). Activation of the oocyte endogenous G proteins by injected GTPγS also evoked a strong stimulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger, which was nucleotide-specific and antagonized by the GDP analog, GDPβS. Interestingly, the stimulatory effect of GTPγS was almost completely inhibited by the non-selective protein kinase inhibitor, H-7, and, most notably, by the PKA inhibitor, H-89, but not by the PKC inhibitor, calphostin C. These findings suggest that activation of the oocyte Na+/H+ exchanger by GTPγS-activated G proteins is not direct but is mediated by a PKA-dependent mechanism most likely due to activation of adenylyl cyclase by GTPγS-activated Gs proteins. GTPγS is a nonspecific activator of G proteins, and the cellular response, therefore, depends on the isoform pattern and relative amounts as well as the availability of the different G proteins and their effectors expressed in a given cell type. Although circumstantial, the finding that the PKC inhibitor calphostin C was without effect on GTPγS-injected oocytes, in contrast to its strong inhibitory effect on βγ subunit-injected cells, suggests that GTPγS did not release sufficient βγ subunits to activate the endogenous phospholipase-PKC pathway. There exists some recent evidence for an activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger by specific G protein α subunits. Expression of mutationally activated α subunits of the G proteins G13, G12, Gq, and Gs in human embryonic kidney cells resulted in increased NHE activity by activated α13 and αq subunits, whereas the other activated subunits left the antiporter unaffected(29Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L. Hooley R. Bourne H.R. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4721-4724Google Scholar). Whereas activation by αq was assumed to be mediated via the stimulated phospholipase C pathway, stimulation of Na+/H+ exchanger by α13 was independent of the inositol phosphate and the cAMP pathways. Expression of mutationally activated αs, αi2, αq, α12, and α13 subunits in COS-1 cells enhanced NHE activity by αq, α12, and α13(30Dhanasekaran N. Vara Prasad M.V.V.S. Wadsworth S.J. Dermott J.M. Van Rossum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11802-11806Google Scholar). While expression of αi2 was without effect, αs even inhibited NHE activity. The stimulatory effect of α12 and αq was apparently mediated by the PKC pathway, whereas the activation by α13 was preserved in cells in which PKC had been down-regulated(30Dhanasekaran N. Vara Prasad M.V.V.S. Wadsworth S.J. Dermott J.M. Van Rossum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11802-11806Google Scholar). The signaling cascade involved in this protein kinase C-independent NHE activation by activated α13 remains to be elucidated. Although our experiments have yet to yield any evidence for a direct G protein regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger of X. laevis oocytes injected with GTPγS or G protein βγ subunits, final statements on this issue require the determination of potential effects evoked by injection of different G protein α subunits. In conclusion, the data presented here suggest that the Na+/H+ exchanger of X. laevis oocytes can be activated by G proteins and that this activation is most likely due to increased formation of second messengers resulting in activation of either PKC and/or PKA. Whether this specific Na+/H+ exchanger actually contains consensus sequences for PKA- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation has to await the full-length cloning of this transporter, which is currently being performed in our laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W2073460983,"A linear, plasmid-like, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was isolated from rice, and its entire sequence of 13,952 nucleotides (nt) was determined. The dsRNA encodes a single, unusually long, open reading frame (13,716 nt, 4,572 amino acid residues), which includes an RNA helicase-like domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-like domain. A series of Northern hybridization and primer extension experiments revealed that the coding (sense) strand of the dsRNA contains a discontinuity (nick) at a position 1,211 nt (or 1, 256 nt) from the 5’ end. This discontinuity divides not only the coding strand of dsRNA molecule into a 1,211-nt fragment and a 12,741-nt fragment (or a 1, 256-nt fragment and a 12, 696-nt fragment) but also divides the long open reading frame into a 5’ part of 1,045 nt (348 amino acid residues) and a 3’ part of 12,671 nt (4,224 amino acid residues) or a 5’ part of 1,090 nt (363 amino acid residues) and a 3’ part of 12,626 nt (4,209 amino acid residues). It seems likely that almost all dsRNA molecules in rice plants contain such a discontinuity. This rice dsRNA appears to be a novel and unique RNA replicon. A linear, plasmid-like, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was isolated from rice, and its entire sequence of 13,952 nucleotides (nt) was determined. The dsRNA encodes a single, unusually long, open reading frame (13,716 nt, 4,572 amino acid residues), which includes an RNA helicase-like domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-like domain. A series of Northern hybridization and primer extension experiments revealed that the coding (sense) strand of the dsRNA contains a discontinuity (nick) at a position 1,211 nt (or 1, 256 nt) from the 5’ end. This discontinuity divides not only the coding strand of dsRNA molecule into a 1,211-nt fragment and a 12,741-nt fragment (or a 1, 256-nt fragment and a 12, 696-nt fragment) but also divides the long open reading frame into a 5’ part of 1,045 nt (348 amino acid residues) and a 3’ part of 12,671 nt (4,224 amino acid residues) or a 5’ part of 1,090 nt (363 amino acid residues) and a 3’ part of 12,626 nt (4,209 amino acid residues).

Pak J.-Y. Fukuhara T. Nitta T. Planta. 1992; 187: 475-482Google Scholar) to higher plants (4Dodds J.A. Morris T.J. Jordan R.L. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1984; 22: 151-168Google Scholar; 3Brown G.G. Finnegan P.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1989; 117: 1-56Google Scholar). These dsRNAs are generally classified into two groups (3Brown G.G. Finnegan P.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1989; 117: 1-56Google Scholar). One group consists of low molecular weight dsRNAs (1.0-5.0 kbp) that are associated with proteins to form virus-like particles, and some of which are referred to as cryptoviruses (2Boccardo G. Lisa V. Luisoni E. Milne R.G. Adv. Virus Res. 1987; 32: 171-214Google Scholar). The second group consists of high molecular weight dsRNAs (more than 10 kbp) that do not appear to be associated with virus-like particles. Because no designation for these high molecular weight dsRNAs has yet been agreed upon, these dsRNAs have been variously referred to as RNA plasmids (3Brown G.G. Finnegan P.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1989; 117: 1-56Google Scholar), indigenous dsRNAs (18Valverde R.A. Nameth S. Abdallha O. Al-Musa O. Desjardins P. Dodds J.A. Plant Sci. (Shannon). 1990; 67: 195-201Google Scholar), and enigmatic dsRNAs (20Wakarchuk D.A. Hamilton R.I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 637-639Google Scholar; 5Fukuhara T. Moriyama M. Pak J.Y. Hyakutake H. Nitta T. Plant Mol.

We found a large dsRNA in both cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wild rice (Oryza rufipogon, an ancestor of O. sativa). This rice dsRNA has the following plasmid-like properties (5Fukuhara T. Moriyama M. Pak J.Y. Hyakutake H. Nitta T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1121-1130Google Scholar), which differ from those of conventional plant RNA viruses: 1) plants harboring the dsRNA are symptomless, 2) its inheritance is vertical, 3) it is present at a constant concentration, and 4) it does not seem to be associated with distinct virus-like particles. The entire sequence of 13,952 nt of the rice dsRNA was determined from a series of independent and overlapping cDNA clones. To our knowledge, ours was the first report of the entire nucleotide sequence of a plasmid-like RNA replicon from a plant. Furthermore, although many kinds of plant RNA virus have an RNA genome, there are few reports of large (more than 10 kbp) plant RNA viruses. The coding (sense) strand of the rice dsRNA molecule contains a single, long ORF of 13,716 nt (4,572 amino acid residues), and the ORF appears to be the longest found to date in plant genes. No nucleotide and amino acid sequences with extensive homology to those of this dsRNA and of this ORF were found in a search of data bases, but an RNA helicase-like domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-like (replicase-like) domain were detected within the ORF (see Fig. 1; 13Moriyama H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; (in press): 248Google Scholar). In addition to the four above mentioned interesting properties, the most conspicuous molecular feature of rice dsRNA is its single, unusually long ORF. Indeed, the rice dsRNA can be regarded as a novel RNA replicon in plants. We now report another unusual structural feature of this dsRNA molecule; the coding (sense) strand of the dsRNA molecule contains a discontinuity (nick) at a specific position. The biological implication of the discontinuity is discussed. Double-stranded RNA was purified from young leaves (or seedlings) of rice plants (Japonica rice cv. Nipponbare) as described previously (5Fukuhara T. Moriyama M. Pak J.Y. Hyakutake H. Nitta T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1121-1130Google Scholar). The cDNA clones (F76 and F88, Fig. 1) and the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction clones (R201 and R306, Fig. 1) were obtained by the method of 7Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Google Scholar and the 5’ rapid amplification of cDNA ends method (16Schuster D.M. Buchman G.W. Rashtchian A. Focus (Idaho). 1992; 14: 46-52Google Scholar), respectively. These clones were used as probes for Northern hybridization. (±) DNA probes were made with a random primer DNA labeling kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) and used for Northern hybridization as shown in Figure 2:, Figure 3:. cDNA fragments were inserted into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and then recombinant plasmids were linearized with a restriction enzyme (BamHI or EcoRI). (+) and(-) riboprobes were made by in vitro transcription in a system that contained T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Corp.). (+) and(-) riboprobes were used in Fig. 3B. The dsRNAs were subjected to electrophoresis either on 1.0% native agarose gels that contained 40 mM Tris acetate buffer (pH 8.1), 2 mM EDTA, and 500 ng/ml ethidium bromide (see Fig. 2A and 3A) or on 1.2% denaturing agarose gels that contained 20 mM MOPS buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.66 M formaldehyde, and 500 ng/ml ethidium bromide (see Fig. 2, B and C, and 3B). The dsRNAs on native or denaturing gels were transferred to nylon membranes (Zeta-Probe GT membrane; Bio-Rad). Hybridization was performed in hybridization medium for the DNA probes (250 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1 mM EDTA, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1% Nonidet P-40) for 16 h at 65°C or in the medium for the riboprobes (125 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 250 mM NaCl, 7% SDS, and 50% formamide) for 16 h at 60°C. The membranes were washed twice with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5% SDS for 30 min and washed twice again with the same buffer containing 1% SDS for 30 min at 65°C. The 25-mer oligonucleotide (5’-GCAATAGCATCGGATCTTAAATGTG-3’) that was complementary to positions 1,461- 1,485 from the 5’ end of the coding strand of the dsRNA molecule was synthesized as a primer for primer extension analysis. The extension reaction was carried out in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 μM dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1 pmol/μl primer, 0.1 μg/μl heat-denatured rice dsRNA as template, 10 units/μl SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.037 MBq/μl [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) for 2 min at 25°C. 1 μl each of 10 mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP were added to 9 μl of the reaction mixture, and then the reaction was continued for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel that contained 89 mM Tris, 89 mM borate, 2 mM EDTA, and 50% urea. When we tried to isolate dsRNA from 10 separate rice plants (Japonica rice cv. Nipponbare) that grew in a greenhouse, dsRNA at similar levels was detected in the case of five individuals by native agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide (Fig. 2A). Five of the ten plants did not contain the dsRNA. There was no obvious difference between the two groups of plants. These samples of dsRNA were subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing agarose gel, and then hybridization experiments were performed using two cDNA probes (F76 and F88; the locations of these probes within the rice dsRNA are indicated in Fig. 1). Bands of 14-kb RNA were found, as expected, in the five samples with either F76 or F88 (Fig. 2, B and C), and, in addition, a band of RNA of about 1.3 kb was unexpectedly detected with F76 only, and the intensity of the hybridization signal of the 1.3-kb band was similar for each of the five samples (Fig. 2B). These bands of 1.3-kb RNA were not detected by Northern hybridization with F88 as probe (Fig. 2C) or by electrophoresis on nondenaturing agarose gels and staining with ethidium bromide (Fig. 2A). In order to characterize the 1.3-kb RNA in further detail, we performed additional Northern hybridization experiments. As well as F76 and F88, clones R201 and R306 were used as a source of probes (Fig. 1). Three types of 32P-labeled probe were prepared: a coding (sense) strand-specific riboprobe ((+) probe), a noncoding (antisense) strand-specific riboprobe ((-) probe), and a DNA probe made from both strands as template ((±) probe). Furthermore, the dsRNAs were subjected to electrophoresis on either native or denaturing agarose gels. Whenever the dsRNA was fractionated on a native agarose gel, only the band of 14-kbp RNA was detected with each type of (±) probe (Fig. 3A). When the dsRNA fractionated on a denaturing agarose gel, the hybridization profile obtained with each probe was different (Fig. 3B). When R201, which corresponds to the 5’-terminal region of the long ORF (Fig. 1), was used, the 14- and 1.3-kb bands together, the 14-kb band alone, and the 1.3-kb band alone were detected with the (±) probe, the(-) probe, and the (+) probe, respectively. When F76 was used, the 14-kb band superimposed on the 12.7-kb band (a composite band) plus the 1.3-kb band, the 14-kb band alone, and the 12.7- and 1.3-kb bands together were detected with the (±) probe, the(-) probe, and the (+) probe, respectively. It was confirmed by electrophoresis under different conditions from those used to generate Fig. 3B that the composite band consisted of the 14- and 12.7-kb bands (data not shown). When we used either F88 or R306, which corresponds to the 3’-terminal region of the long ORF (Fig. 1), similar hybridization profiles were obtained. The composite band consisting of 14- and 12.7-kb RNAs, the 14-kb band alone and the 12.7-kb band alone were detected with the (±) probe, the(-) probe, and the (+) probe, respectively. These results indicate that the coding strand of the dsRNA molecule contains one discontinuity (nick) at a position about 1,300 nt from the 5’ end and that the dsRNA molecule is separated into three molecules, a 1.3-kb molecule (the 5’ part of the coding strand), a 12.7-kb molecule (the 3’ part of the coding strand), and a 14-kb molecule (the entire noncoding strand) on denaturing agarose gels. Furthermore, almost all the dsRNA molecules found in almost all rice plants are likely to contain such a discontinuity, because 1) only the 1.3-kb band (not the 14-kb band) was detected using the (+) probe derived from R201 (Fig. 3B), 2) the dsRNA samples analyzed in Fig. 3B were isolated from seedlings that were comprised of many rice plants, and 3) the intensity of the hybridization signal of the 1.3-kb band in Fig. 2B was similar for each of the five samples. To determine precisely the site of the discontinuity on the coding strand of the dsRNA molecule, we synthesized a 25-mer oligonucleotide primer that was complementary to positions 1,461-1,485 nt, counted from the 5’ end of the coding strand of the dsRNA molecule, and we performed a primer extension experiment. Two main products of the primer extension reaction were detected in lane P in Fig. 4. This indicates that the discontinuity was located between A at position 1,211 and C at position 1,212 and/or between A at position 1,256 and G at position 1,257 from the 5’ end of the coding strand. This discontinuity divides not only the coding strand of the dsRNA molecule into a 1,211-nt 5’ fragment and a 12,741-nt 3’ fragment (or a 1,256-nt 5’ fragment and a 12,696-nt 3’ fragment) but also divides the long ORF into a 5’ part of 1,045 nt (348 amino acid residues) and a 3’ part of 12,671 nt (4,224 amino acid residues) (or a 5’ part of 1,090 nt (363 amino acid residues) and a 3’ part of 12,626 nt (4,209 amino acid residues)). We tried to confirm the 5’ end of 12.7-kb molecule of the coding strand by the 5’ rapid amplification of cDNA ends method (16Schuster D.M. Buchman G.W. Rashtchian A. Focus (Idaho). 1992; 14: 46-52Google Scholar), and the results were similar to those of the primer extension experiments (data not shown). At least two possible mechanisms can be proposed for the formation of this discontinuity; the coding strand of the dsRNA could be cleaved either by its own ribozyme activity (self-cleavage) or by a specific ribonuclease encoded by the host genome. 15Pfeiffer P. Jung J.L. Heitzler J. Keith G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1167-1173Google Scholar recently reported that a 16.7-kbp dsRNA from Vicia faba contains one discontinuity, which seems to divide the coding strand into molecules of 12.2 and 4.5 kb. The biological implications of the discontinuity in dsRNA from rice and V. faba are unknown, but the finding of a discontinuity in different kinds of dsRNA molecules suggests that such a discontinuity plays an important role in the life cycle of these large plasmid-like dsRNAs. The discontinuity is likely to affect the replication of the dsRNA molecule, the transcription of the coding strand, and the translation of the long ORF. Although other large dsRNAs with plasmid-like properties similar to those of the rice dsRNA have been found in barley (22Zabalgogeazcoa I.A. Gildow F.E. Plant Sci. (Shannon). 1992; 83: 187-194Google Scholar), pepper (18Valverde R.A. Nameth S. Abdallha O. Al-Musa O. Desjardins P. Dodds J.A. Plant Sci. (Shannon). 1990; 67: 195-201Google Scholar), Phaseolus vulgaris (19Wakarchuk D.A. Hamilton R.I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1985; 5: 55-63Google Scholar; 11Mackenzie S.A. Pring D.R. Bassett M.J. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1988; 76: 59-63Google Scholar), and so on, it is not yet known whether these large dsRNAs include a discontinuity. The rice dsRNA has some plasmid-like properties and encodes one extremely long ORF that contains an RNA helicase-like domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-like domain (5Fukuhara T. Moriyama M. Pak J.Y. Hyakutake H. Nitta T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1121-1130Google Scholar; 13Moriyama H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; (in press): 248Google Scholar). Comparisons of the amino acid sequences of these two domains and of the entire genetic organization of the rice dsRNA to those of potyviruses (single-stranded RNA viruses with a (+) RNA genome of about 10 kb (1Allison R. Johnston R.E. Dougherty W.G. Virology. 1986; 154: 9-20Google Scholar)) and the 12.7-kbp dsRNA of chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, (Cryphonectria hypovirus 1-713 (8Hillman B.I. Fulbright D.W. Nuss D.L. Van Alfen N.K. Murphy F.A. Sixth Report of the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1994Google Scholar), previously known as hypovirulence-associated virus (17Shapira R. Choi G.H. Nuss D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 731-739Google Scholar)) suggest that the rice dsRNA is evolutionarily located between potyviruses and Cryphonectria hypovirus 1-713 (13Moriyama H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; (in press): 248Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rice dsRNA contains a discontinuity at a specific position in the coding strand. Many kinds of dsRNA virus have been detected in bacteria (12Mindich L. Adv. Virus Res. 1988; 35: 137-176Google Scholar), protozoa (21Wang A.L. Wang C.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 251-263Google Scholar), fungi (6Ghabrial S.A. Adv. Virus Res. 1994; 43: 303-388Google Scholar), plants (14Nuss D.L. Dall D.J. Adv. Virus Res. 1990; 38: 249-306Google Scholar), and animals (10Joklik W.K. The Reoviridae. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Google Scholar), but no dsRNA virus that contains a discontinuity within its genome, except for the V. faba dsRNA, has been reported. Thus, the rice dsRNA appears to be a unique and novel RNA replicon."

The data revealed that both FXa and FVa could accelerate tPA activity by as much as 60-fold for Lys-Pg and >150-fold for Glu-Pg. This function of FVa depended on pretreatment with plasmin (Pn), whereas the FXa fibrinolytic cofactor activity was endogenous. In the native state, FVa was observed to inhibit the acceleration of Pn generation by FXa. These effects were dependent on Ca2+ and procoagulant phospholipid. Interactions between plasminogen and prothrombinase components were quantified. The apparent Kd for binding to FXa was 35 nM. Strikingly, the affinity between FVa and Pg was increased by approximately 2 orders of magnitude when the FVa was Pn-pretreated (Kd = 0.1 μM). These data cumulatively suggest a mechanism by which Pn production is coordinated with coagulation and localized to sites where procoagulant phospholipid is exposed on a cell surface.

Lippincott Company, Toronto1982: 623-639Google Scholar). One of the proteases that mediates Pg activation is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which has relatively poor intrinsic reactivity toward Pg. Thus, a fundamental regulatory step in fibrinolysis is the acceleration of tPA through the assembly of a ternary complex between tPA, Pg, and a protein cofactor such as fibrin or a cell surface receptor. The colocalization of Pg and tPA functions to increase the rate of catalysis by 1-2 logs through a Km effect and to restrict tPA activity to sites of fibrin deposition. Additionally, the association of Pg with endothelial cell receptors is known to accelerate the conversion of the native NH2-terminal Glu-Pg to the truncated Lys-Pg species (18Hajjar K.A. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1769-1778Google Scholar). The outcome is that Lys-Pg is activated by tPA approximately 10 times more efficiently than Glu-Pg (20Holaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R.

Through the use of lysine analogues and carboxypeptidase B, these proteins have been shown to have in common a COOH-terminal lysine that may be the only necessary structural feature for binding to Pg (40Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Google Scholar). Most of the Pg receptors have been shown to accelerate tPA-mediated activation of Pg (6Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Google Scholar; 24Kelm Jr., R.J.

In the current study, the human blood coagulation factor Xa (FXa), which is known from its cDNA sequence to possess the necessary lysyl moiety (14Fung M.R. Hay C.W. MacGillivray R.T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3591-3595Google Scholar; 39Messier T.L. Pittman D.D. Long G.L. Kaufman R.J. Church W.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 291-294Google Scholar), was evaluated as a Pg-binding protein and accelerator of Pn generation by tPA. The established function of the serine protease FXa in hemostasis is to produce the final enzyme in the coagulation pathway, thrombin (28Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 222: 260-280Google Scholar; 28Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 222: 260-280Google Scholar). To do so, FXa must associate in the presence of Ca2+ with the cofactor Va (FVa) and procoagulant phospholipid (e.g. phosphatidylserine), which synergistically accelerate FXa activity by 5 orders of magnitude (43Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Google Scholar). Procoagulant phospholipid is accessible only on the surface of activated cells and therefore restricts prothrombinase assembly to sites of vascular damage (46Nesheim M.E. Tracy R.P. Tracy P.B. Boskovic D.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 316-328Google Scholar; 59Zwaal R.F.A. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 248-253Google Scholar). Since FVa stabilizes the interaction of FXa with biological membranes, a role for FVa in fibrinolysis was also evaluated. We now report that both FXa and FVa can participate as cofactors for tPA-mediated Pg activation. HEPES, EDTA (Sigma), Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone (EGRck), 2-guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid (GEMSA), aprotonin, porcine carboxypeptidase B (CPB, Calbiochem), benzoyl-Ile-Glu-(piperidyl)-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2337), Glu-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2366, Helena Laboratories) were obtained commercially. Human coagulation factor X was purified from fresh frozen plasma (3Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Prodanos C. Prep. Biochem. 1981; 11: 387-412Google Scholar) or from prothrombin complex concentrate diluted to 1 unit/ml factor X clotting activity (obtained as generous gifts from the Canadian Red Cross Society, Ottawa Collection Centre or from Miles Therapeutics, Inc., respectively). Factor Xa (approximately 1000 units/mg) was generated from factor X (21Jesty J. Nemerson Y. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 95-107Google Scholar; 25Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Google Scholar) by treatment with the purified activator from Russell's viper venom (Haematologic Technologies) (21Jesty J. Nemerson Y. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 95-107Google Scholar), followed by affinity chromatography using benzamidine-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to remove the factor X activation peptide, Russell's viper venom, and residual inactivated factor X (25Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Google Scholar). The irreversible inhibition of factor Xa was accomplished by treatment with a 4-fold molar excess of EGRck (to produce EGR-factor Xa) (49Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8969-8977Google Scholar). Complete inhibition of factor Xa (1.5 μM) was confirmed by the lack of detectable conversion of the chromogenic substrate S-2337 (200 μM) over a 15-min period using a kinetic microplate reader (Vmax, Molecular Devices) with full scale set to 0.03 OD. Excess EGRck was removed by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration chromatography (Pharmacia). Human Glu-plasminogen and Lys-plasminogen were purified as described (45Nesheim M. Fredenburgh J.C. Larsen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21541-21548Google Scholar) and passed over benzamidine-Sepharose (Pierce) to remove any trace of serine protease activity. Plasminogen was radioiodinated using Iodogen (Pierce) and chromatographically desalted (Excellulose 5, Pierce) to remove unincorporated 125I. Human factor Va was commercially prepared (Haematological Technologies) according to established protocols (13Fair D.S. Sledge C. Krueger R.G. Mann K.G. Hood L.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5561-5568Google Scholar; 23Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Google Scholar). The homogeneity of proteins was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and where applicable by autoradiography using X-Omat AR film (Kodak) and Quanta III intensifying screens (DuPont). Purified human plasmin (Diagnostica Stago), single-chain tPA (American Diagnostica), and CNBr-treated human fibrinogen (tPA activator, Kabi Vitrum) were purchased. To follow the interaction between prothrombinase proteins and 125I-Pg, an adaptation of a method employed by 22Kalafatis M. Xue J. Lawler C.M. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6538-6545Google Scholar was used. In these experiments, microtiter wells (Immulon 3) were coated with 0.3 μg of a mixture of phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) (25%:75%), pure PC or no phospholipid in 100 μl of methanol/well by evaporation in a vacuum desiccator. On the same day, coated wells (and uncoated wells to control for a possible methanol effect) were blocked for 2 h with 200 μl of 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature and rinsed once with 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.2 (HBS) with 1 mg/ml BSA (HBS/BSA). In 100 μl/well of HBS/BSA, FXa, FVa, or a mixture of the two proteins was equilibrated with 125I-Pg each at 50 nM for 1 h at 22°C. In some experiments, the prothrombinase proteins were preincubated for 1 h and then washed three times with HBS/BSA before addition of 125I-Pg. Aprotonin (150 KIU/ml) and benzamidine (2 mM) were kept throughout to inhibit any potential Pn activity and proteolysis by FXa, respectively. After incubation, the wells were washed four times with HBS/BSA and the 125I-Pg remaining bound was quantified. To determine the effect of Pn on the binding of FXa or FVa to 125I-Pg, the FXa and FVa were pretreated for 30 min with Pn (1.0 nanokatal/ml) and then inhibited by addition of a large excess of aprotonin (150 KIU/ml) before introducing the 125I-Pg into the mixture. The tPA (10 nM)-mediated activation of Pg (0.5 μM) was followed at 22°C in HBS/BSA using a chromogenic assay. At various times, 5 μl of the reaction mixture was combined with 150 μl of chromogenic substrate (S2366, 0.2 μM) and the rate of color development was quantified using a kinetic multiwell plate reader (Vmax, Molecular Devices). tPA was the final component added to initiate the process. The effect of FXa and FVa (in most cases 0.1 μM) was evaluated by including these proteins prior to the Pg. In some experiments the FXa and FVa (0.125 μM) were pretreated with Pn (1.0 nanokatal/ml) for 25 min at 22°C. The Pn was then inhibited with a small excess of aprotonin (2.5 KIU/ml). To be consistent, the experiments not pretreated with Pn were incubated identically. All reactions and pretreatments were done in the presence of synthetic unilamellar phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% phosphatidylcholine and 25% phosphatidylserine (PCPS, 50 μM) (28Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 222: 260-280Google Scholar due to the known acceleratory effect on Pn cleavage of FVa (47Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9750-9755Google Scholar) and requirement for PCPS in prothrombinase assembly (33Lim T.K. Bloomfield V.A. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4177-4181Google Scholar; 34Mann K.G. Odegaard B.H. Krishnaswamy S. Tracy P.B. Nesheim M.E. Proteases in Biological Control and Biotechnology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar; 46Nesheim M.E. Tracy R.P. Tracy P.B. Boskovic D.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 316-328Google Scholar). To confirm the observations made with the chromogenic assay, under identical conditions 125I-Pg (60,000 cpm/μg) activation was followed by electrophoresis. Samples were reduced using dithiothreitol (20 mM) to resolve the Pg from Pn, then run on 10% acrylamide gels (Laemmli, 1970). After drying, the gels were subjected to autoradiography using X-Omat AR film (Kodak) and Quanta III intensifying screens (DuPont). The Pn bands were excised from the gel to quantify using a γ-counter (Beckman). To correct for background, a slice from each lane that did not correspond to a band on the autoradiograph was quantified and subtracted from those of Pn. Our first attempt to identify a possible involvement of FXa in fibrinolysis, was to follow the specific interaction of 125I-Lys-Pg to prothrombinase components that were bound to PCPS-coated microtiter wells (Fig. 1). Selective binding of 125I-Lys-Pg was observed. However, the preincubation experiment (panel A) was dependent on the presence of both FXa and FVa, whereas in the coincubation system FXa alone or the FXa/FVa mixture facilitated 125I-Lys-Pg binding. Since FVa is known to stabilize the interaction of FXa with PCPS, this discrepancy is likely the result of the additional washing steps in the former. An additional difference between the two incubation conditions is that considerably less 125I-Lys-Pg remained bound to the microtiter wells in panel B. This may be the result of solution-phase inhibition by FXa. Both experiments demonstrated that 125I-Lys-Pg binding is dependent on PS and Ca2+. The association of 125I-Lys-Pg was inhibitable by addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Lys-Pg to the level observed with BSA alone (data not shown). Cumulatively, these observations are consistent with FXa functioning as a bridge between Pg and PCPS that is stabilized by FVa. Having demonstrated that FXa is indeed capable of functioning as a receptor for Pg, we next determined whether FXa and/or FVa can accelerate the activation of Lys-Pg by tPA. Although the chromogenic substrate used in these experiments (S2366) is not as specific for Pn as the conventional substrate (S2251), it was selected to increase the assay sensitivity by 3-4-fold. FXa and FVa were used at 0.1 μM, which approximates the Kd for Pg binding to other receptors (15Ganz P.R. Dupuis D. Dudani A.K. Hashemi S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 69: 554-562Google Scholar; 19Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, FXa greatly enhanced the rate of Lys-Pg activation. An initial velocity was estimated from the slope to the first time point (2 min) and compared to the first observation of Pn activity in the absence of FXa (8 min), which suggested a 60-fold increase in the rate of tPA catalysis by FXa. Addition of an equimolar amount of FVa to the FXa did not dramatically alter the kinetics profile, although a modest lag was consistently observed. As a comparison to a well documented fibrinolytic cofactor, the effect of CNBr-cleaved fibrinogen at a weight equal to that of the FVa (≈0.02 mg/ml) was observed to have approximately 50% of the effect of FXa. The dependence of the reaction on tPA and Pg was confirmed by the lack of chromogenic substrate cleavage after 40 min if either were omitted in the presence or absence of FXa/FVa (data not shown). When only FVa was included in the Lys-Pg activation mixture, the amount of Pn generated was the same as tPA alone over the first 12-17 min. Following this period, the reaction rate was appreciably accelerated by FVa. Since the proteolysis of FVa by Pn has been reported (31Lee C.D. Mann K.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 185-190Google Scholar; 47Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9750-9755Google Scholar), we speculated that the FVa may be acquiring fibrinolytic cofactor activity during the experiment by a Pn-dependent feedback mechanism. To test this hypothesis, the FXa and/or FVa were preincubated with Pn. The effect of this treatment (Fig. 3) was to abolish the lag phase observed in the previous experiment when FVa alone was included in the reaction mixture. The FVa fibrinolytic activity remained the same as the system without Pn pretreatment if aprotonin was added before the Pn (data not shown). Pretreatment with Pn was also observed to modulate the effect of FXa on tPA (Fig. 3). This was not as dramatic as observed for FVa and resulted in an approximately 50% decrease of the untreated FXa activity. To our knowledge, evidence for a Pn-sensitive cleavage site on FXa has not been described but would account for our observed loss in activity. We are currently investigating this possibility. As a control, addition of aprotonin before the Pn pretreatment prevented the loss in FXa fibrinolytic activity (data not shown). The combined acceleratory effect of Pn-pretreated FXa and FVa on tPA activity was approximately the sum of the individual effects. The estimated initial velocity for Pn production was identical to that of untreated FXa, which may indicate that the tPA is saturated under these conditions and the kinetics are approaching Vmax. Pn pretreatment of the CNBr-cleaved fibrinogen appeared to reduce its tPA cofactor activity. Since this was opposite to the effect of Pn on the FXa/Va mixture or FVa alone, it can be inferred that contaminating fibrinogen is not the basis for our observations. To confirm our chromogenic assays, we followed conversion of 125I-Lys-Pg to 125I-Pn by electrophoresis. These data (Fig. 4) are consistent with the conclusions made from Figure 2:, Figure 3:. 1) FXa and a mixture of FXa/FVa greatly accelerate tPA activity to approximately the same extent (panel A); 2) in the presence of FVa alone, Pn generation undergoes a 12-min lag before the rate is accelerated (panel A); 3) Pn pretreatment of FVa eliminates the lag (panel B); 4) the FXa acceleratory effect is decreased by Pn pretreatment (panel B); and 5) the mixture of Pn-pretreated FXa/FVa has the same initial rate of Lys-Pg conversion as untreated FXa (panel B). Fig. 5 shows that FXa and FVa also enhance the rate of Glu-Pg activation by tPA. 1) FXa has endogenous tPA cofactor activity (panel A); 2) FVa induced a lag in the endogenous FXa effect (panel A), although this was much more pronounced compared to Lys-Pg (Fig. 2); 3) Pn pretreatment of the FVa converted it into a tPA accelerator; 4) Pn pretreatment decreased the FXa cofactor activity; and 5) Pn-pretreated FXa and FVa combined to increase the rate of Pn generation. As reported in the literature, Lys-Pg is converted more rapidly to Pn than Glu-Pg by tPA. We observed this characteristic in the absence of either prothrombinase constituent where over 30 min of Glu-Pg activation was negligible. As a result, the feedback modulation of FVa by Pn was not observed using Glu-Pg (panel A). Since a lag was observed in the rate that FXa-enhanced Pn production when equimolar FVa was present (Fig. 2), we explored the possibility that before cleavage by Pn the FVa was a regulator. Shown in Fig. 6 is the effect of increasing the FVa concentration on Pn generation from Lys-Pg at a constant level of FXa. The data show that the extent of the lag phase is dependent on the amount of FVa added and is lengthened to 22 min at the highest concentration of FVa. Following the lag, a rapid rate of Lys-Pg activation is resumed, which is likely contributed to by both FXa and Pn-cleaved FVa fibrinolytic activity. This experiment suggests that within the prothrombinase complex, the participation of FXa as a fibrinolytic cofactor is inhibited until the FVa is feedback-modulated by Pn. Having established that FXa and Pn-treated FVa can participate in the acceleration of Pn production by tPA, the contributions of the FXa serine protease active site, Ca2+, and procoagulant phospholipid were evaluated. Fig. 7(panel A and B) shows the effect of blocking the active site of FXa with a tripeptidylchloromethyl ketone (EGRck). In contrast to native FXa, EGR-FXa did not demonstrate significant tPA cofactor activity alone (panels A and B). Since Pg is believed to interact exclusively with the COOH terminus of known receptors (6Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Google Scholar; 9Dudani A.K. Cummings C. Hashemi S. Ganz P.R. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 185-196Google Scholar; 24Kelm Jr., R.J. Swords N.A. Orfeo T. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30147-30153Google Scholar; 40Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Google Scholar), the effect of blocking the active site of FXa may be on tPA. Without Pn pretreatment (panel A), active site-independent synergy between EGR-FXa and FVa was observed. This effect was not apparent after Pn pretreatment (panel B), which suggests that FXa may function to accelerate the cleavage of FVa by Pn. To determine the role of Ca2+ in the tPA cofactor function of FXa and FVa, excess EDTA was added to the various reaction mixtures. The data show that without Pn treatment (panel C), the cofactor effects of FXa and FVa were abolished in the absence of Ca2+. The data also suggest that the Ca2+-dependent association of FXa with PCPS is necessary for tPA cofactor activity. Interestingly, when the FXa and FVa were pretreated with Pn in the presence of Ca2+ (panel D), the subsequent addition of EDTA caused a complete loss of the FXa-dependent tPA activity, but approximately 50% of the initial FVa acceleratory effect on tPA remained. When the entire experiment was conducted in the presence of Ca2+, but PCPS was completely omitted (panels E and F), neither FXa nor FVa had an influence on the rate of Lys-Pg activation regardless of whether a Pn pretreatment step was performed. The data presented above establish that Pn is capable of altering the participation of FVa and to a lesser extent of FXa in Pg activation by tPA. To determine whether this may be an effect on the ability of FVa and FXa to interact with Pg, the various equilibria were quantified. The binding isotherms shown in Fig. 8, were obtained by coincubating the 125I-Lys-Pg and prothrombinase constituents. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the amount of 125I-Lys-Pg bound to PC-coated microtiter wells from the amount bound to PCPS-coated wells. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) and number of moles bound at saturation (Bmax) were derived by fitting the data to a simple rectangular hyperbola, which implicitly assumed a single class of sites (Table 1). Perhaps the most striking conclusion from these data is that Pn treatment of FVa enhances the affinity for Lys-Pg by approximately 2 orders of magnitude. This may account for the acquisition of tPA cofactor activity by FVa when treated with Pn. Similarly the decrease in the tPA cofactor activity of FXa after Pn treatment may be explained by the 10-fold decrease observed in affinity for Lys-Pg. An inconsistency with the kinetic experiments is that prior to Pn treatment, FVa did not influence the binding of Lys-Pg to FXa. Furthermore, after Pn treatment, the FXa and FVa were shown to have a combined effect on Pg activation by tPA (Fig. 3), but FVa had no effect on Lys-Pg binding to FXa. These discrepancies may be reconciled by direct effects on tPA that have yet to be identified.TABLE I Open table in a new tab A possible function for the FXa COOH-terminal Lys was investigated by pretreating the FXa with CPB (Table 2). The data clearly revealed that the tPA cofactor function of FXa is sensitive to CPB, which supports the involvement of a COOH-terminal Lys in FXa. To control for the possibility that the CPB inhibitor GEMSA or residual CPB activity had a direct effect on Pn generation by tPA, the FXa was simultaneously incubated with CPB and GEMSA. A small decrease in the initial velocity compared to no pretreatment of FXa was observed, but was insignificant compared to the loss in FXa cofactor activity when pretreated first with CPB. Similar observations were made when Glu-Pg was used instead of Lys-Pg as a substrate (data not shown).TABLE II Open table in a new tab Coagulation and fibrinolysis are opposing hemostatic processes. To effectively coordinate the activation of procoagulant and subsequently of profibrinolytic enzymes, a high degree of molecular cross-talk between these pathways must exist. As an important example, the end product of coagulation, fibrin, communicates to the fibrinolytic pathway by functioning as an accelerator of tPA-dependent Pn generation (32Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 223: 197-206Google Scholar). Consequently, tPA activity is restricted until clot has formed. In the current study, we provide evidence that the protein components of prothrombinase, FXa and FVa, are also capable of signaling fibrinolysis by acceleration of tPA. A model that summarizes the molecular links between fibrinolysis and prothrombinase is presented in Fig. 9. In previous work, Pn was demonstrated to irreversibly block the FXa cofactor role of FVa in thrombin production (31Lee C.D. Mann K.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 185-190Google Scholar; 47Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9750-9755Google Scholar). We now report that Pn-modulated FVa acquires tPA cofactor activity, either in the presence or absence of FXa. Treatment of FVa with Pn also correlates with the expression of a cryptic Pg binding site. The apparent Kd of 0.1 μM is well below the plasma concentration of Pg (2.4 μM) and may be a driving force for the participation of FVa in fibrinolysis. Whether a direct effect on tPA also results after FVa is cleaved by Pn is currently unresolved. Thus Pn induces a functional switch in FVa from a procoagulant in the native state to a profibrinolytic. The FXa moiety of prothrombinase was also observed to accelerate Pn generation by tPA. Unlike FVa, however, the tPA cofactor activity of FXa was endogenous. Evidence that FVa directly regulates the FXa fibrinolytic activity was obtained from experiments showing that addition of native FVa induced a dose-dependent lag before the acceleration of Pn generation was achieved. Following Pn pretreatment, the FVa was found to lose this antagonistic effect. A plausible explanation is that Pn-mediated proteolysis may break the interaction between FXa and FVa in a manner similar to the inhibition of FVa by activated protein C (17Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13986-13992Google Scholar; 49Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8969-8977Google Scholar). The general conclusion from these data is that Pn-mediated feedback controls the intrinsic fibrinolytic capability of FXa through an indirect route involving FVa. Since we found that FVa did not influence the binding affinity of Pg to FXa, this regulatory mechanism is suggested to include an effect on tPA. The association of Pg with FXa was found to be approximately 10-fold stronger (apparent Kd = 35 nM) than Pg binding to other receptors. This may make FXa a particularly effective profibrinolytic cofactor. In this report, we have not attempted to define the kinetics of tPA acceleration by FXa or FVa. However, to compare the efficacy of the prothrombinase components to known tPA cofactors, we have estimated the extent of acceleration relative to tPA alone at a single concentration of reactants. In the presence of FXa or Pn-pretreated FVa, we observed approximately 60-fold enhancement for the initial rate of Lys-Pg activation. This is within the same range as the known tPA accelerators, annexin II (6Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Google Scholar) and various fibrin derivatives (32Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 223: 197-206Google Scholar). When Glu-Pg was used as a substrate, the generation of Pn in the presence of tPA alone did not exceed base-line levels over the course of the experiment, which complicates the determination of fold enhancement. Nevertheless, we estimate the increase in observed rate due to FXa to be >150-fold and somewhat less for Pn-pretreated FVa. These values are considerably greater than those reported for other Pg receptors (24Kelm Jr., R.J. Swords N.A. Orfeo T. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30147-30153Google Scholar; 51Reinartz J. Hansch G.M. Kramer M.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 844-850Google Scholar) and fibrin derivatives (32Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 223: 197-206Google Scholar). A comprehensive evaluation of the kinetics must be conducted to verify these comparisons. The role of procoagulant phospholipid as an essential prothrombinase cofactor and as a means to localize thrombin production has been well documented (4Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. van Rijn J.L.M.L Hemker H.C. Zwaal R.F.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 429Google Scholar, 5Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 736: 57-66Google Scholar; 47Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9750-9755Google Scholar; 48Packham M.A. Mustard J.F. Blood Platelet Function and Medical Chemistry. Elsevier Biomedical, New York1984Google Scholar). Calcium is also required for prothrombinase assembly and functions by facilitating the interaction between FVa subunits (12Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 964-973Google Scholar; 26Krishnaswamy S. Russell G.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3160-3168Google Scholar), the binding of FXa to PCPS (42Nelsestuen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5648-5656Google Scholar; 44Nesheim M.E. Kettner C. Shaw E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6537-6540Google Scholar) and the binding of FXa to FVa (49Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8969-8977Google Scholar). In the current work, the acceleration of tPA by FXa and FVa was also found to be dependent on PCPS and Ca2+. This observation may be partially explained by the known increased rate of FVa Pn-mediated proteolysis in the presence of PCPS (47Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9750-9755Google Scholar). However, the modest enhancement that was reported (approximately 5-fold) cannot account for the complete loss of tPA acceleration by Pn-pretreated FVa in the absence of PCPS. Interestingly, when Pn proteolysis of FVa was conducted in the presence of PCPS and Ca2+, and then EDTA added prior to assaying for tPA activity with PCPS, 50% of the FVa cofactor activity remained. Taken together these data suggested that an interaction between FVa and PCPS is necessary for FVa to express tPA cofactor function and the Ca2+-independent association of the 30-kDa Pn-derived fragment of the FVa light chain with PCPS may be directly involved. In the case of FXa, we observed that acceleration of tPA was facilitated only when a FXa-Ca2+-phospholipid complex could form. The interaction of FXa with Ca2+ (7Church W.R. Boulanger L.L. Messier T.L. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17882-17887Google Scholar; 42Nelsestuen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5648-5656Google Scholar; 49Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8969-8977Google Scholar; 50Radcliffe R.D. Barton P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7735-7742Google Scholar) and with phospholipid (27Krishnaswamy S. Field K.A. Edgington T.S. Morrissey J.H. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26110-26120Google Scholar) is known to induce a conformational change that may be required for tPA cofactor activity. Thus the profibrinolytic effect of FXa and FVa is localized to sites only where exposure of procoagulant phospholipid initially triggered the generation of thrombin. Annexin II is the only other known cellular receptor for Pg that may also be localized to sites where procoagulant phospholipid is expressed. This is through the preferential interaction of annexin family proteins with procoagulant phospholipid (1Andree H.A. Reutelingsperger C.P. Hauptmann R. Hemker H.C. Hermens W.T. Willems G.M. J. Biol.

However, unlike FXa and FVa, the fibrinolytic cofactor activity of annexin II does not depend on the association with procoagulant phospholipid (6Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Google Scholar) and consequently may not be as strictly localized as FXa and FVa. FXa and FVa can associate with a variety of stimulated cells and may function to generate Pn at these sites either independently or with other Pg receptors. Activated platelets are considered to provide the most abundant physiological source of procoagulant phospholipid (8Dahlbach B. Stenflo J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4938-4945Google Scholar; 41Miletich J.P. Jackson C.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6908-6916Google Scholar; 4Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. van Rijn J.L.M.L Hemker H.C.

As a result, prothrombinase is concentrated within a clot and may locally participate in concert with fibrin to accelerate fibrinolysis. At this time, the concentration of FXa and FVa at these sites is unknown. Since the concentration of fibrin is high, it is probable that the largest individual effect of prothrombinase constituents on fibrinolysis will be on susceptible cells that are not trapped by fibrin. While other Pg receptors may exist on platelets, annexin II is not found in association with these cells (11Eldering J.A. Kocher M. Clemetson J.M. Clemetson F.J. Frey F.J. Frey B.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 231-234Google Scholar). The fibrinolytic activity of annexin II has been identified on the endothelial surface (19Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Google Scholar), which is also an important site for prothrombinase assembly (53Rodgers G.M. Shuman M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 844: 320-329Google Scholar). Therefore annexin II, FXa, and FVa may act together to stimulate fibrinolysis on the endothelium. A functional difference is suggested from the possibility that annexin II may exist on the surface of resting cells (19Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Google Scholar), whereas recruitment of FXa and FVa requires cell stimulation. At least one other endothelial cell receptor for Pg has been identified (9Dudani A.K. Cummings C. Hashemi S. Ganz P.R. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 185-196Google Scholar), but whether the expression of this 45-kDa protein is modulated following cell stimulation is unknown. The formation of prothrombinase has also been described in association with monocytes (37Mcgee M.P. Li L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8079-8085Google Scholar; 57Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2119-2124Google Scholar) and carcinoma cells (54Sakai T. Noguchi M. Kisiel W. Haemostasis. 1990; 20: 125-135Google Scholar). In previous studies, Pg binding to these cells and generation of Pn on the surface of monocytes was observed to be enhanced by Pn pretreatment (16Gonzalez-Gronow M. Stack S. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 625-628Google Scholar). This is similar to our current observation with FVa. Certain carcinoma cells are known to secrete FV (54Sakai T. Noguchi M. Kisiel W. Haemostasis. 1990; 20: 125-135Google Scholar), but whether these reports are due to FV/FVa Pn-mediated modulation or other Pg receptor(s) is unknown. In addition to a fibrinolytic function, the possibility that FVa and FXa may accelerate Pn generation at the surface of monocytes or carcinoma cells suggests a role in tissue remodeling (29Kwaan H.C. Keer H.N. Radosevich J.A. Cajot J.-F. Ernst R. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1991; 17: 175-182Google Scholar). The interaction of Pg with fibrin (32Lijnen H.R. Collen D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30147-30153Google Scholar) is known to depend on the accessibility of specific Lys residues in the receptor protein. Like many Pg receptors, the FXa-mediated acceleration of Pg activation by tPA was observed by us to involve a COOH-terminal Lys in FXa. This suggests that in addition to the control of FXa fibrinolytic function by FVa, a recently identified thrombin-activated plasma protein having carboxypeptidase B activity (TAFI) (2Bajzr L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar) may be involved. Whether the acquisition of FVa fibrinolytic activity following Pn treatment is the result of exposing a new COOH-terminal Lys is under investigation. We thank G. Kessler and Y.

Conservation of this motif among the fibrillar collagens has led to the proposal that the oligosaccharide has structural or functional importance, but a role in collagen biosynthesis has not been unambiguously defined. To examine directly the function of the proα1(I) C-propeptide N-linked oligosaccharide, the acceptor Asn residue was changed to Gln by site-directed mutagenesis. In transfected mouse Mov13 and 3T6 cells, unglycosylated mutant proα1(I) folded and assembled normally into trimeric molecules with proα2(I). In biosynthetic pulse-chase experiments mutant proα1(I) were secreted at the same rate as wild-type chains; however, following secretion, the chains were partitioned differently between the cell layer and medium, with a greater proportion of the mutant proα1(I) being released into the medium. This distribution difference was not eliminated by the inclusion of yeast mannan indicating that the high-mannose oligosaccharide itself was not binding to the matrix or the fibroblast surface after secretion. Subtle alterations in the tertiary structure of unglycosylated C-propeptides may have decreased their affinity for a cell-surface component. Further support for a small conformational change in the mutant C-propeptides came from experiments suggesting that unglycosylated proα1(I) chains were cleaved in vitro by the purified C-proteinase slightly less efficiently than wild-type chains. Mutant and normal proα1(I) were deposited with equal efficiency into the 3T6 cell accumulated matrix, thus the reduced cleavage by C-proteinase and altered distribution in the short pulse-chase experiments were not functionally significant in this in vitro extracellular matrix model system.

Asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation of proteins begins with the synthesis of a high-mannose carbohydrate chain, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, attached to a dolicol lipid carrier (for review, see (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Google Scholar)). Transfer of the oligosaccharide to an Asn residue in the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X is any amino acid(2Kaplan H.A. Welply J.K. Lennarz W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 161-173Google Scholar)) occurs co-translationally during translocation of the nascent polypeptide into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Processing of the oligosaccharide begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, and continues as the protein is transported through the Golgi, to produce a wide variety of oligosaccharide structures. The roles of these carbohydrate groups are not fully understood. Their contribution to glycoprotein function is variable and inherent to a given protein; however, some general principles are emerging. N-Linked oligosaccharide attachment is required for proper folding and oligomerization of many secreted and cell surface glycoproteins(3Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3268-3273Google Scholar, 4Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1049-1059Google Scholar, 5Singh I. Doms R.W. Wagner K.R. Helenius A.

Oligosaccharides also modulate the biological activity of proteins by influencing solubility, protease resistance, and protein-protein interactions and can act as protein targeting signals(13Olden K. Parent J.B. White S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 650: 209-232Google Scholar, 14Rademacher T.W. Parekh R.B. Dwek R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 785-838Google Scholar, 15Paulson J.C.

The attachment signal is highly conserved between species and within the fibrillar group of collagens (types I, II, III, V, and XI) suggesting that the N-linked oligosaccharide may play a common essential structural or functional role in procollagen biosynthesis. carboxyl-terminal propeptide carboxyl-terminal proteinase procollagen processing intermediate retaining the amino-terminal propeptide procollagen processing intermediate retaining the carboxylterminal propeptide kilobase(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Several studies have addressed the role of the N-linked carbohydrate chain on the type I collagen C-propeptides using tunicamycin to inhibit the synthesis of the lipid-linked carbohydrate donor and thus prevent N-glycosylation. However, the results have been contradictory; both normal and impaired secretion(20Duksin D. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 955-962Google Scholar, 21Tanzer M.L. Rowland F.N. Murray L.W. Kaplan J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 500: 187-196Google Scholar, 22Housley T.J. Rowland F.N. Ledger P.W. Kaplan J. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 121-128Google Scholar) and normal and impaired extracellular cleavage of the C-propeptide have been reported(20Duksin D. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 955-962Google Scholar, 21Tanzer M.L. Rowland F.N. Murray L.W. Kaplan J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 500: 187-196Google Scholar, 23Duksin D. Davidson J.M. Bornstein P. Arch.

In this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis to remove the proα1(I) C-propeptide N-linked oligosaccharide attachment site. This approach overcomes the problems associated with the general glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin such as the variable reduction of protein synthesis by different preparations (25Mahoney W.C. Duksin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6572-6576Google Scholar, 26Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Google Scholar) and effects on other glycoproteins involved in the collagen biosynthetic pathway. The mutation was introduced into a proα1(I) reporter protein construct with a helical Met822-Ile substitution which allowed mutant and normal gene products to be experimentally distinguished and quantified by their different CNBr cleavage patterns(27Fenton S.P. Lamande S.R. Hannagan M. Stacey A. Jaenisch R. Bateman J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 469-474Google Scholar). In this way, the biosynthetic fates of normal and mutant proα1(I) chains expressed in the same transfected cell were directly compared. Unglycosylated proα1(I) subunits assembled normally into trimeric molecules with proα2(I) and were secreted at the same rate as endogenous proα1(I). Molecules containing unglycosylated proα1(I) chains were processed by the procollagen C-proteinase and deposited into an in vitro extracellular matrix. To determine the role of the C-propeptide N-linked oligosaccharide in type I collagen biosynthesis, a COL1A1 gene construct was produced in which Asn1187 2Amino acids are numbered from the translation start site of pre-proα1(I). (28), within the Asn-Ile-Thr attachment recognition sequence, was changed to Gln. The mutagenesis protocol is summarized in Fig. 1. Two COL1A1 gene constructs were produced. In the control construct, to act as a protein marker and allow discrimination of the mutant and wild-type C-propeptides by CNBr mapping, amino acid 1199 (C-propeptide residue 159) was changed from Met (ATG) to Ala (GCG). Two silent base changes introduced an AccII site (Fig. 1a). In addition to these changes, the C-propeptide N-linked oligosaccharide attachment signal was removed in the mutant construct by changing amino acid 1187 (C-propeptide residue 147) from Asn (AAC) to Gln (CAA). The substituting marker and mutant amino acids were chosen because they were predicted to have a minimal effect on the secondary structure of the region based on computerized sequence analysis (PepPlot, Genetics Computer Group). Synthetic StuI-BstXI DNA fragments containing the sequence changes (Fig. 1a) were ligated into a 2.0-kb XbaI-EcoRI genomic subclone (Fig. 1b). Plasmids containing the additional AccII site (Fig. 2) were selected and the modified region sequenced (data not shown). The 1.4-kb XhoI-ClaI fragment from selected clones was used to replace the normal fragment of pWTCI-I, an α1(I) protein reporter gene construct containing a helical Met822-Ile substitution (27Fenton S.P. Lamande S.R. Hannagan M. Stacey A. Jaenisch R. Bateman J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 469-474Google Scholar), and the wild-type 4.5-kb ClaI fragment reinserted (Fig. 1b). The orientation of the ClaI fragment was determined by digestion with HindIII (Fig. 3). The final reassembled genes, named to indicate the amino acid substitutions in the protein products, were the reporter construct pWTCI-I (25-kb COL1A1 gene containing the Met-Ile substitution at amino acid 822 of the triple helix(27Fenton S.P.

Nature. 1983; 304: 315-320Google Scholar) and 3T6 cells (American Type Culture Collection, CCL-96) were grown in culture as described for human skin fibroblasts (30Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Google Scholar) Cells were co-transfected with the COL1A1 gene constructs and pSV2neo(31Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341Google Scholar), neomycin-resistant transfected cells were selected in G418, and individual colonies isolated and expanded into cell lines as described previously(27Fenton S.P. Lamande S.R. Hannagan M. Stacey A. Jaenisch R. Bateman J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 469-474Google Scholar). G418 was removed from the culture medium after the fourth passage. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and then supplemented daily with 0.25 mM ascorbic acid. Procollagens were biosynthetically labeled routinely at 1-2 days post-visual confluence and at other relevant times during long term culture experiments. The medium was removed and replaced with 9.9 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum and 0.25 mM ascorbic acid. After 4 h, 0.1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 μCi of L-[5-3H]proline (8.5 Ci/mmol, NEN Research Products) or 5 μCi of L-[14C]proline (284.6 mCi/mmol, NEN Research Products) was added to the medium, and the incubation was continued for a further 18 h. The final concentration of proline in the medium was 0.1 mM. To examine procollagen secretion kinetics, cells were labeled for 1 h with 5 μCi L-[14C]proline, the labeling stopped by the addition of proline to a final concentration of 50 mM, and the radioactive collagen chased for up to 4 h. In some experiments 1 mg/ml yeast mannan (Sigma) was included throughout the preincubation, labeling, and chase periods. Following incubation, the cell layer and medium fractions were treated separately as described previously(30Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Google Scholar, 32Bateman J.F. Chan D. Mascara T. Rogers J.G. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 699-708Google Scholar). Briefly, after disruption of the cell layer by sonication, procollagens and collagens were precipitated from the cell and medium fractions with ammonium sulfate at 25% saturation. The precipitate was redissolved in 2 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl and the protease inhibitors 5 mM EDTA, 10 mMN-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of procollagens were precipitated with 75% ethanol and subjected to limited pepsin digestion (100 μg/ml pepsin in 0.5 M acetic acid, 4°C, 16 h) to remove noncollagen sequences. Cell layers from cultures which had been supplemented daily from confluence (day 0) with 0.25 mM ascorbic acid were sequentially extracted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl and proteinase inhibitors (neutral salt soluble fraction), and by digestion with pepsin (0.1 mg/ml pepsin in 0.5 M acetic acid) as described previously(33Chan D. Lamande S.R. Cole W.G. Bateman J.F. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 175-181Google Scholar). Freeze-dried samples of pepsin-digested collagen were resuspended in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to inactivate the pepsin. CNBr cleavage was performed in 70% (v/v) formic acid containing 50 mg/ml CNBr for 4 h at room temperature as described by Scott and Veis(34Scott P.G. Veis A. Connect. Tiss. Res. 1976; 4: 107-116Google Scholar). After cleavage the samples were diluted with water and freeze-dried. Procollagens were precipitated with 75% ethanol and digested with 30 μg/ml bacterial collagenase (Worthington Biochemicals, CLSPA) for 2 h at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 3.5 mMN-ethylmaleimide. Digestion was terminated by lyophilization. Purified C-proteinase was a gift from Dr. Karl E. Kadler (School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, United Kingdom). Procollagen substrate was purified from the medium of cells which had been biosynthetically labeled for 18 h with either 50 μCi of L-[5-3H]proline (8.5 Ci/mmol; NEN Research Products) or 5 μCi of L-[14C]proline (284.6 mCi/mmol; NEN Research Products). L-Arginine (50 mM) was added to the cultures to prevent cleavage of the COOH-terminal propeptide by the C-proteinase present in the medium(35Leung M.K.K. Fessler L.I. Greenberg D.B. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 224-232Google Scholar). Procollagens were precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 25% saturation, resuspended in neutral-salt buffer, and reprecipitated with 18% (v/v) ethanol. Procollagens were incubated with C-proteinase at 34°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.12 M NaCl and 5 mM CaCl2. Digestion was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Collagen chains were resolved on 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide separating gels with a 3.5% (w/v) stacking gel. Collagen CNBr peptides and C-propeptides were analyzed on 10 or 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Sample preparation, electrophoresis conditions, and fluorography of radioactive gels have been described elsewhere(30Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Google Scholar, 32Bateman J.F. Chan D. Mascara T. Rogers J.G. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 699-708Google Scholar). The radioactivity in the collagen bands was quantified by excision and scintillation counting(36Bateman J.F. Harley V. Chan D. Cole W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 171-176Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred from 12.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose filters (BA85, Schleicher and Schuell). Blots were probed with an antibody which recognizes the last 21 amino acids of the proα1(I) chain (LF-41(37Fisher L.W. Lindner W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Connect. Tiss.

Specific binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A (Bio-Rad) and the color reagent 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Bio-Rad). Terminal mannose residues on the C-propeptide N-linked oligosaccharide were detected using the lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA, DIG Glycan Differentiation Kit, Boehringer Mannheim). The Met822-Ile marker substitution in the helical domain allowed the transfected gene products to be distinguished from endogenous α1(I) and quantified in processed chains by the altered CNBr cleavage pattern(27Fenton S.P. Lamande S.R. Hannagan M. Stacey A. Jaenisch R. Bateman J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 469-474Google Scholar). The functionally neutral substitution removed the CNBr cleavage site between the CB7 and CB6 peptides. The level of expression of the transfected α1(I) genes containing the [Ile822]α1(I) substitution was calculated using a previously determined formula which takes into account the low level of uncleaved CB7-6 contributed by the endogenous α1(I)(27Fenton S.P. Lamande S.R. Hannagan M. Stacey A. Jaenisch R. Bateman J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 469-474Google Scholar). The constructs were transfected into Mov13 cells to assess the ability of unglycosylated proα1(I) chains to fold and assemble into trimeric helical molecules. Untransfected Mov13 cells synthesize only the proα2(I) subunit of type I collagen; transcription of the endogenous proα1(I) genes is blocked by a retroviral insertion in the first intron(29Schnieke A. Harbers K. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1983; 304: 315-320Google Scholar, 38Harbers K. Kuehn M. Delius H. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1504-1508Google Scholar). Proα2(I) chains are unable to fold into homotrimeric molecules and, in the absence of proα1(I), are degraded intracellularly. Mov13 cells stably transfected with either the control construct, pWTCI-IA (Mov13-IA7-Mov13-IA10), or the mutant gene, pWTCI-IQA (Mov13-IQA1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9), synthesized proα1(I) chains which associated with the endogenous proα2(I), folded into pepsin-resistant molecules, and were efficiently secreted (Fig. 4). There was no evidence of slowly migrating α1(I) or α2(I) chains like those seen in osteogenesis imperfecta patients where mutations which perturb chain association or slow the folding of the triple helix led to excess post-translational hydroxylation and glycosylation of lysine residues resulting in slow electrophoretic migration of the chains(30Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Google Scholar, 32Bateman J.F. Chan D. Mascara T. Rogers J.G. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 699-708Google Scholar, 39Chessler S.D. Wallis G.A. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18218-18225Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate that the mutation altering the N-glycosylation consensus sequence prevented propeptide glycosylation, [3H]proline-labeled procollagens were digested with bacterial collagenase to degrade the collagen α-chains and the released C-propeptides compared electrophoretically (Fig. 5a). The identity of the propeptides was confirmed by immunoblotting with a specific C-propeptide antibody (Fig. 5b). The control proα1(I) C-propeptides migrated as a doublet of a minor and major species (Fig. 5a, lanes 2 and 3; b, lanes 1 and 2). The minor, faster migrating band in each lane was also present in samples not digested with collagenase (Fig. 5a, lane 1) and is probably α1(I) C-propeptide released by cleavage with the endogenous procollagen C-proteinase present in the culture medium. The major species of C-propeptide, produced by bacterial collagenase digestion, migrated more slowly because they retained the α1(I) telopeptide domain. The migration of control C-propeptides as sharp bands suggested that all the propeptides were N-glycosylated and homogeneous in the size of the carbohydrate substitutions. The mutant C-propeptide doublet migrated significantly faster than control propeptides (Fig. 5a, lane 4; b lane 3). Failure of the mutant propeptides to bind the lectin GNA which recognized the control C-propeptides (Fig. 5c) indicated that the mutant C-propeptide migrated faster because it lacked the N-linked carbohydrate unit. Several studies have reported impaired C-propeptide processing in cultures treated with tunicamycin, a general inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation(20Duksin D. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 955-962Google Scholar, 23Duksin D. Davidson J.M. Bornstein P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 185: 326-332Google Scholar, 24Duksin D. Mahoney W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3105-3109Google Scholar). This could be due to changes in the structure or function of either the C-proteinase or the procollagen substrate. To determine if unglycosylated procollagen is a substrate for the N-glycosylated C-proteinase, procollagens produced by cells labeled with either [14C]proline (Mov13-Ile4) or [3H]proline (Mov13-IA8 and Mov13-IQA3) were isolated and incubated for varying periods of time with purified C-proteinase. To eliminate experimental variation due to contaminants in the procollagen samples, the procollagens were mixed and cleavage of wild-type and control or mutant C-propeptides directly compared. Aliquots were examined by electrophoresis under reducing conditions and the proportion of proα1(I), pCα1(I)/pNα1(I), and α1(I) chains present determined by dual-label counting of the excised bands. Results of three separate experiments are shown in Fig. 6. The C-proteinase was able to cleave both control [IA]proα1(I) and mutant [IQA]proα1(I) C-propeptides as judged by the conversion of proα1(I) chains to the pNα1(I) processing intermediate. In each experiment, control [IA]proα1(I) chains were processed at the same rate as the wild-type proα1(I) chains (Fig. 6, a, c, and e), but the unglycosylated [IQA]proα1(I) chains were cleaved slightly more slowly (Fig. 6, b, d, and f). While the difference in the rate of processing of the mutant proα1(I) was small, it was reproducible and was accurately compared to processing of the wild-type proα1(I) by digesting mutant and normal procollagens, differentially labeled with 14C and 3H, in the same tube. The appearance of intact cleaved C-propeptides (data not shown) was an indication that the observed C-propeptide processing was specific. No nonspecific cleavage was seen when the procollagens were incubated for 2 h in the absence of the C-proteinase (data not shown). The mutant construct was transfected into 3T6 cells to allow the biosynthetic fate of normal endogenous proα1(I) and unglycosylated mutant chains to be compared directly. Individual G418-resistant colonies were expanded into cell lines and analyzed separately. Endogenous and transfected gene products could be discriminated and quantified in these cells because the C-propeptide changes were introduced into a reporter construct containing a functionally neutral Met822-Ile substitution which deletes the CNBr cleavage site between the CB7 and CB6 peptides. Expression of transfected mutant gene products was readily detected after CNBr cleavage of pepsin-digested collagen by the increased relative intensity of the CB7-6 peptide (Fig. 7(27Fenton S.P. Lamande S.R. Hannagan M. Stacey A. Jaenisch R. Bateman J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 469-474Google Scholar)). As in the transfected Mov13 cells, there was no evidence of slowly migrating overmodified peptides (Fig. 7). Immunoblotting with antibody LF-41 detected the glycosylated form and a smaller unglycosylated form of the proα1(I) C-propeptide in the medium of 3T6 cells transfected with the mutant construct (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and 5). Only the larger, glycosylated form was present in untransfected 3T6 cells and cells transfected with the control gene (Fig. 8, lanes 1-3).Figure 8:Electrophoretic analysis of the α1(I) C-propeptides produced by transfected 3T6 cells.

IFP consists of three non-identical subunits with apparent molecular masses of 87, 32, and 22 kDa, respectively, and contains at least two FMN (Em,6.8 = −57 mV) and two plant-ferredoxin-type [2Fe-2S]2+,1+ clusters (Em,6.8 = −260 mV)/α2β2γ2 structure. Both FeS and flavin centers of IFP are slowly but fully reduced by the enzymatically reduced cognate ferredoxin under anaerobic conditions at 50°C, but not by NAD(P)H. Thus, the ferredoxin-dependent redox system of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 is tentatively proposed as follows: 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (thiamine pyrophosphate and [4Fe-4S] cluster)3 ⟶ ferredoxin ⟶ IFP ([2Fe-2S] cluster ⟶ FMN).

Recent studies on the physiological function of ferredoxins in several strictly anaerobic archaea (archaebacteria) led to unexpected findings that oxidized ferredoxin functions as an intermediate electron acceptor of a variety of key steps in the central metabolic pathways involved in saccharolytic and peptide fermentation, where NAD(P) usually substitutes in some bacteria (eubacteria)(1Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Google Scholar, 2Adams M.W.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 627-658Google Scholar, 3Schicho R.N. Ma K. Adams M.W.W. Kelly R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1823-1830Google Scholar). Reduced ferredoxin thus formed is then reoxidized by a hydrogenase (4Bryant F.O. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5070-5079Google Scholar) and possibly by a ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase(5Schfer T. Schnheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 354-363Google Scholar). In the case of a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus, the hydrogenase also functions as an elemental sulfur reductase(6Ma K. Schicho R.H. Kelly R.M. Adams M.W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5341-5344Google Scholar).On the other hand, the ferredoxin-dependent redox system of aerobic respiratory archaea such as Halobacteria and Sulfolobus remains only poorly understood. As in the cases of aerobic bacteria and eukarya (eukaryotes) with mitochondria, these archaea acquire biological energy by aerobic respiration rather than simple fermentative pathway, and in fact contain a membrane-bound aerobic respiratory chain, which directly couple to an archaeal tricarboxylic acid cycle at least at the level of the respiratory complex II (succinate:quinone oxidoreductase complex(7Danson M.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 58-64Google Scholar, 8Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. Matsuura K. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, New York1994: 755-758Google Scholar)). Their oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle, however, differs considerably from those of eukarya with mitochondria and most of aerobic bacteria in that the decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate is catalyzed by a coenzyme-A-acylating 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase(7Danson M.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 58-64Google Scholar, 9Kerscher L. Nowitzki S. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 223-230Google Scholar, 10Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 371-374Google Scholar) instead of conventional 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes (11Koike M. Koike K. Adv. Biophys. 1976; 9: 187-227Google Scholar). The archaeal 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases are considerably smaller enzymes (100 ~ 300 kDa) and contain at least thiamine pyrophosphate and [4Fe-4S]2+,1+ cluster as prosthetic groups(10Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 371-374Google Scholar, 12Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 587-594Google Scholar, 13Blamey J.M. Adams M.W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1161: 19-27Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze in the 2-oxoacid-dependent reduction of ferredoxins, but do not utilize NAD(P)+ as a physiological electron acceptor. Interestingly, their cofactor composition is remarkably similar to those from fermentative and phototrophic obligatory anaerobic bacteria (14Uyeda K. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol.

Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 529-536Google Scholar, 21Mller M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 465-488Google Scholar). However, as opposed to the cases proposed in earlier studies for some obligatory anaerobes such as Clostridia and Chlorobia(7Danson M.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 58-64Google Scholar, 14Uyeda K.

Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 587-594Google Scholar, 22Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 595-600Google Scholar). In fact, the reoxidation process of enzymatically reduced ferredoxin in aerobic respiratory archaea remains unknown.Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 (originally named as Sulfolobus acidocaldarius strain 7)1 1The organism had been isolated from Beppu hot springs, Japan, originally named as Sulfolobus acidocaldarius strain 7, but was recently redesignated tentatively as “Sulfolobus sp. strain 7” due to small differences in 16 S rRNA base sequences of strain 7 and S. acidocaldarius type strain DSM 639.

The chemoheterotrophically grown archaeon acquires biological energy by aerobic respiration rather than simple fermentative pathway(8Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. Matsuura K. Yagi K.

Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, New York1994: 755-758Google Scholar). On the other hand, the archaeal cytoplasmic fraction contains a large amount of a 7Fe ferredoxin, which has been purified, crystallized(25Fujii T. Moriyama H. Takenaka A. Tanaka N. Wakagi T.

The subsequent characterization showed that it contains one [3Fe-4S]1+ /0 cluster (E = −280 mV versus NHE) and one [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster (E = −530 mV), of which only the [3Fe-4S] cluster is reduced during the steady-state turnover of the cognate 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase(26Iwasaki T.

Schnheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 354-363Google Scholar), the in vitro reconstitution system containing the Sulfolobus 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, 7Fe ferredoxin, and NADPH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase in the presence of NADP+, 2-oxoacid, and CoA did not catalyze any 2-oxoacid- and ferredoxin-dependent formation of NADPH when tested anaerobically at 50°C and at physiological pH (pH 5.5-6.8 (cf.

CoA was obtained from Kohjin (Tokyo). DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-Toyopearl 650 M, and hydroxylapatite HTP were purchased from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Tosoh Corporation, and Bio-Rad, respectively.

Biochem. 1982; 128: 223-230Google Scholar), except that the reaction was carried out in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and was initiated by addition of the purified enzyme. Non-enzymatic reduction of cytochrome c by coenzyme A at this temperature was corrected. For routine assays, 2-oxoacids (2-oxoglutarate was mainly used), coenzyme A, the Sulfolobus ferredoxin, and horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma) were present at the concentrations of 2-4 mM, 50-100 μM, 25 μM, and 50 μM, respectively.Aldehyde oxidoreductase activities were tested spectrophotometrically as described by Mukund and Adams(1Mukund S.

The cells were suspended in 40 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mM EDTA and disrupted with a French press (Otake Works, Tokyo) at 1500 kg/cm2 twice, and the supernatant (containing negligible amount of cytochrome) obtained after ultracentrifugation with a Beckman 45Ti rotor at 130,000 × g for 100 min at 15°C, was used as the cytosolic fraction.The Sulfolobus 7Fe ferredoxin was purified as described previously (25Fujii T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29444-29450Google Scholar) and was stored at −80°C until use. Purified ferredoxin gave a single band on 20% analytical gel electrophoresis and had a purity index (A408/A280) of 0.70(26Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Isogai Y. Tanaka K. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29444-29450Google Scholar). Approximately 30-40 mg of purified material could be routinely obtained from about 150 g (wet weight) of the cells.A soluble 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase was also purified from the cytosol fraction to an electrophoretically homogeneous state, as will be described elsewhere.3 Approximately 6-8 mg of pure enzyme could be obtained from about 100 g (wet weight) of the cells, and the purified enzyme was stored at −80°C until use. The purified enzyme used in this study had the specific activities of 69 units/mg with 2-oxoglutarate and 39 units/mg with pyruvate, respectively.Purification of a Novel Red Iron-Sulfur Flavoprotein (IFP) from Sulfolobus Strain 7All steps were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise specified and by following three different absorption bands at 280, 430, and 570 nm and the patterns on SDS-PAGE. The cytosol fraction was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (3.0 × 28 cm) which had been previously equilibrated with 30 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.3, containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The column was then washed with 500 ml of the equilibration buffer, and the materials bound to the column was eluted by a 1600-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-400 mM) in the equilibration buffer. The red fractions eluted around 50 mM NaCl were collected and combined, and then made to 1 M ammonium sulfate solution by addition of solid ammonium sulfate at 4°C, while gently stirring. The suspension was gently degassed by aspirator at room temperature and was directly applied to a phenyl-Toyopearl 650 M column (1.2 × 25 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1 M ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with 100 ml of the equilibration buffer, and a 200-ml linear gradient was run between 1 M and 0 M ammonium sulfate in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. At this step, the red-colored fractions eluted at the end of the linear gradient were clearly separated from the 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and diaphorase (NAD(P)H:dye oxidoreductase) activities. When necessary, the column was further washed by 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, to enhance the complete elution of the red protein. The combined fractions were then diluted 5-fold by addition of 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and applied to a Bio-Rad hydroxylapatite column (1.2 × 23 cm) which had been pre-equilibrated with distilled water (Milli-Q). The column was washed with 100 ml of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and the red protein still bound to the column was eluted by a 250-ml linear gradient of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 (10-200 mM). The red protein eluted around 110 mM potassium phosphate was collected, and was concentrated by pressure filtration on an Amicon YM-10 membrane under N2 gas at 4°C. The concentrated material (3 ml or less) was loaded onto a 34-ml glycerol density gradient (10-24%, v/v) in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, which had been placed on 0.5 ml of 25% glycerol (v/v) cushion (containing 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8), and was ultracentrifugated with a Beckman SW28 rotor at 28,000 revolutions/min for 20 h at 10°C. The red FeS flavoprotein appeared as a single band at ~19% glycerol (v/v), which was collected by tubing and analyzed by SDS-PAGE for purity. The purified material thus obtained was tentatively designated as IFP hereafter, and was stored at −80°C until use.Analytical MethodsAbsorption spectra were recorded with a Hitachi U-3210 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectric cell holder, or with a Beckman DU7400 photodiode-array spectrophotometer. EPR measurements were carried out using a JEOL JEX-RE1X spectrometer equipped with an Air Products model LTR-3 Heli-Tran cryostat system, in which temperature was monitored with a Scientific Instruments series 5500 temperature indicator/controller. CD spectra were recorded at room temperature on a JASCO J-500C spectropolarimeter equipped with a JASCO Data Processor DP-50, in 0.5-cm cells.The potentiometric titration of the redox centers of the purified red FeS flavoprotein (IFP) was performed at room temperature in a Thunberg-type cell similar to that described by Dutton (29Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Google Scholar) under continuous flow of N2 gas and stirring, in the presence of 5 μM each of methyl viologen, anthraquinone-β-sulfonic acid, phenadine methosulfate, and vitamin K3 as redox mediators. Ambient redox potentials (Eh) were monitored with a Pt-Ag/AgCl electrode (Type PS-165F, Toa Electronic Ltd., Tokyo), and desired potentials were attained by adding a small volume of potassium ferricyanide or sodium dithionite solution. The obtained absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3000 spectrophotometer connected to a Fujitsu FM 16β HD-II personal computer. To minimize the effects of mediators, absorbance pair at 420 and 490 nm were used for corrections of the base-line drift; the absorbance at 440 and 465 nm of each difference spectrum (after a subtraction of each base line) were then analyzed for the calculation of the midpoint redox potentials from the titration curves obtained by a fitting program (written at the Department of Biology, Tokyo Metropolitan University).The apparent molecular masses of the purified proteins were estimated by a gel filtration analysis with a calibrated Tosoh G-3000XL column equipped with a Tosoh HPLC 8030, which had been equilibrated with 50 mM MOPS-NaOH buffer, pH 6.8, containing 200 mM NaCl. Protein was measured by the BCA assay (Pierce Chemical) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The metal content analyses of the purified proteins were carried out by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry with a Seiko SPS 1500 VR instrument. The type of flavin released from purified IFP by denaturation in the presence of 5% trichloroacetic acid was identified according to the method of Faeder and Siegel (30Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 64: 136-141Google Scholar) using a Shimadzu spectrofluorophotometer RF-540, and the content of FMN was estimated using an extinction coefficient at 450 nm of 12.2 mM-1 cm-1(31Whitby L.G. Biochem. J. 1953; 54: 437-442Google Scholar).Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (SDS-PAGE) was carried out according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) on 12-20% gels after treating proteins with 2% SDS in the presence or absence of 2% 2-mercaptoethanol at 90°C for 15 min, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and scanned by a densitometer (Shimadzu dual-wavelength scanner CS-930). Analytical PAGE (in the absence of SDS) was carried out with the Laemmli discontinuous system on 5 or 7.5% gels in the absence of SDS, and proteins were visualized by CBB staining.N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of each subunit of purified IFP was carried out by a 470A Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems), after separation of subunits on SDS-PAGE gels and recovering by electroelution in the presence of 0.1% SDS; the gels had been visualized by reversible imidazole/Zn/SDS-staining(33Ortiz M.L. Calero M. Patron C.F. Castellanos L. Mendez E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 300-304Google Scholar).RESULTSPurification and Molecular Composition of a Novel Iron-Sulfur Flavoprotein of Sulfolobus, IFPIn an earlier stage of the present studies, a 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase with broad substrate specificities toward 2-oxoacids (the specific activities of 69 units/mg with 2-oxoglutarate (Km = 0.87 mM) and 39 units/mg with pyruvate (Km = 0.25 mM), respectively) was purified from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7,3 and appeared to reduce only the [3Fe-4S] cluster of the cognate 7Fe ferredoxin during the steady-state turnover of the enzyme(26Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Isogai Y. Tanaka K. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29444-29450Google Scholar). It is the most similar to H. salinarium pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (12Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 587-594Google Scholar, 34Plaga W. Lottspeich F. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 391-397Google Scholar) and contains one thiamine pyrophosphate cofactor and one low potential [4Fe-4S]2+,1+ cluster.3 In subsequent studies, the archaeal NADPH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase was partially purified to test for its ability to reoxidize the reduced form of the cognate 7Fe ferredoxin in the presence of NADP+in vitro. However, the Sulfolobus NADPH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase could not reoxidize ferredoxin that had been reduced enzymatically by 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate and CoA; no NADPH production could be detected at physiological pH (data not shown).4 It therefore seemed plausible that certain other enzyme(s) should reoxidize the enzymatically reduced 7Fe ferredoxin in vivo to excerpt the excess reductant formed during the 2-oxoacid oxidation process of Sulfolobus.Since various ferredoxin-dependent redox systems in bacteria and anaerobic archaea involve numerous FeS proteins(2Adams M.W.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 627-658Google Scholar, 35Knaff D.B. Hirasawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 93-125Google Scholar, 36Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Google Scholar), several FeS proteins were systematically searched after fractionation of the Sulfolobus cytosol fraction with a DEAE-Sephacel column and tested for their abilities to reoxidize enzymatically reduced ferredoxin; among them, a red FeS flavoprotein copurified with the cognate 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase showed a weak ferredoxin-reoxidizing activity, which was subsequently purified to an electrophoretically homogeneous state and was tentatively designated as IFP (see below).Purified IFP showed a single band on 5% analytical PAGE in the absence of SDS and had an apparent molecular mass of 290 kDa by the gel filtration analysis (data not shown). It consisted of three dissimilar subunits (α, β, and γ) on SDS-PAGE with apparent molecular masses of 87, 32, and 19 kDa, respectively(roughly with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry; Fig. 1). These data suggest that IFP is most likely an α2β2γ2-hexamer. Approximately 50-60 mg of pure protein was reproducibly obtained from ~2000 mg of the cytosolic proteins (corresponding to ~60 g (wet weight) of the cells), indicating that it comprises at least ~3% of the total cytosolic proteins of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7. The apparent abundance may imply a physiological importance of IFP in the archaeon.The presence of non-heme iron in purified IFP was indicated by its red color and was confirmed by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, which resulted 14.5 nmol of Fe/mg of protein (~4.2 mol of Fe/mol of protein). The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry also showed that as isolated IFP did not contain any of the following metals: cobalt, nickel, tungsten, and zinc (data not shown).The sequence of the N-terminal 17 amino acid residues of the γ subunit of IFP was determined to be MLV(R)PGEKVKI(S)VXVNG, where X and letters in parentheses represent ambiguous amino acid residues. The partial amino acid sequence search against the EMBL and Swiss-Prot amino acid sequence data bases, however, did not show any specific motif or considerable homology to any known sequence for other metalloenzymes (data not shown), and did not give any clue to assess a possible function of IFP. On the other hand, the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the α and β subunits were most likely blocked, as indicated by extremely low recoveries from the protein sequencer (data not shown).Spectral Properties and Potentiometric Titration of the Sulfolobus IFPFig. 2 shows the optical spectra of purified IFP. The air-oxidized spectrum (as prepared) shows absorption maxima at 278, 341, and 428 nm (the A341/A278 ratio to be 0.22) and shoulders at 462 and 547 nm (Fig. 2, trace A). Upon reduction by excess dithionite, at least two shoulders at 455 and 540 nm are observed (Fig. 2, trace C). The optical properties resemble those of FeS proteins containing a plant-ferredoxin-type [2Fe-2S] cluster(37Malkin R. Lovenberg W. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. Academic Press, New York1973: 1-26Google Scholar). A distinct shoulder at 462 nm in the air-oxidized state (trace B) indicates the presence of flavin, which has been determined to be 1.5-1.6 mol of FMN/mol protein after denaturation of purified IFP in the presence of 5% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min (Table 1). FMN was not efficiently released from the protein by conventional heat treatment due likely to its extreme thermostability, which is consistent with the optimal temperature for the growth of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 (75-80°C(23Wakagi T. Oshima T. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1986; 7: 342-345Google Scholar)); only ~30% of the absorbance of IFP was bleached without any substantial change over the visible region, even after boiling the sample at 100°C for 10 min (data not shown). On the other hand, the material precipitated by centrifugation after the acid denaturation was white, indicating the absence of covalently bound flavin in IFP.Figure 2:UV visible spectra of purified IFP of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7. The protein concentration was 3.7 mg/ml in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The scale of the full range spectrum of the oxidized IFP is reduced to 0.2-fold (viz., A278 = 3.61).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TABLE"
https://openalex.org/W1974390948,"In order to investigate the molecular basis for differences in the characteristics of bombesin (Bn) and m3 muscarinic cholinergic (m3 ACh) receptors, chimeric Bn receptors possessing cytoplasmic domains from the m3 ACh receptor were produced. The receptors were expressed in CHO-K1 cells and binding, structural, and signal transduction characteristics were analyzed. Cell lines bearing chimeric Bn receptors possessing m3 ACh receptor domains in place of either the second cytoplasmic loop (BM2L), the third cytoplasmic loop (BM3L), or both loops (BM23L) each bound 125I-bombesin with a single affinity that was approximately the same as that of the Bn receptor (5-10 nM). However, Bn receptors possessing the m3 ACh third cytoplasmic loop were severely affected in other respects. Internalization of ligand in Bn and BM2L cells was rapid and extensive (>80% of bound 125I-bombesin was acid-resistant). In contrast, internalization was dramatically reduced in BM3L and BM23L cells (~20% of bound 125I-bombesin was acid-resistant). In Bn or BM2L cells 10 nM bombesin stimulated ~10-fold increases in phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. Activation of Bn receptors also induced an increase in arachidonic acid release (478 ± 32% of control, n = 3) and large increases in intracellular Ca2+. In contrast, in BM3L or BM23L cells, bombesin had no significant effect on phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. Furthermore, BM3L receptor activation did not increase arachidonic acid release. However, BM3L and BM23L cells showed a small increase in intracellular Ca2+ at high concentrations of bombesin. These data indicate that the third cytoplasmic loop alone, or together with the second cytoplasmic loop, was not sufficient to transfer the characteristics of G protein interaction between m3 ACh and bombesin receptors. Furthermore, for the Bn receptor, ligand internalization does, whereas formation of the high affinity binding state does not, appear to require activation of G proteins. In order to investigate the molecular basis for differences in the characteristics of bombesin (Bn) and m3 muscarinic cholinergic (m3 ACh) receptors, chimeric Bn receptors possessing cytoplasmic domains from the m3 ACh receptor were produced. The receptors were expressed in CHO-K1 cells and binding, structural, and signal transduction characteristics were analyzed.

These data indicate that the third cytoplasmic loop alone, or together with the second cytoplasmic loop, was not sufficient to transfer the characteristics of G protein interaction between m3 ACh and bombesin receptors. Furthermore, for the Bn receptor, ligand internalization does, whereas formation of the high affinity binding state does not, appear to require activation of G proteins. The serpentine G protein-linked receptors are so named due to their structural characteristic of spanning the plasma membrane 7 times and for their functional characteristic of interacting with heterotrimeric G proteins. The best known interaction between serpentine receptors and G proteins involves activation of G protein α subunits and the subsequent stimulation of cellular effectors such as phospholipases, adenylyl cyclase, or ion channels leading to biological responses (for review, see (1Spiegel A.M. Shenker A. Weinstein L.S. Endocrinol. Rev. 1992; 13: 536-565Google Scholar)). Less well known and less well understood interactions between these receptors and G proteins influence other aspects of receptor function including receptor binding affinity and internalization. Formation of high affinity binding states requires receptor interaction with G proteins(1Spiegel A.M. Shenker A. Weinstein L.S. Endocrinol. Rev. 1992; 13: 536-565Google Scholar). For β-adrenergic receptors, formation of the high affinity state has been shown to better correlate with the ability of receptors to interact with, and then to activate, G proteins(2Hausdorff W.P. Hnatowich M. O'Dowd B.F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1388-1393Google Scholar). However, the importance of G protein activation in the formation of high affinity binding states has not been well studied for other receptors. Receptor internalization may also be influenced by receptor G protein interactions. Internalization characteristics of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors have been most extensively characterized. After exposure to agonists, these receptors rapidly sequester into a space that is inaccessible to hydrophilic ligands and which likely represents receptor internalization. Mutational studies with several G protein-coupled receptors have produced mutants that are defective in their abilities to sequester(3Moro O. Shockley M.S. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6651-6655Google Scholar, 4Stefan C.J. Blumer K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3339-3349Google Scholar, 5Yang J. Logsdon C.D. Johansen T.E. Williams J.A. Mol.

However, some, but not all, of these mutations interfere with G protein activation. Therefore, the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in the process of sequestering these receptors is unclear. Also, for bombesin (Bn)1 1The abbreviations used are: BnbombesinAChacetylcholinePCRpolymerase chain reactionPBSphosphate-buffered salineSLOstreptolysin OGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphatePPIpolyphosphoinositidesCHOChinese hamster ovary. 1The abbreviations used are: BnbombesinAChacetylcholinePCRpolymerase chain reactionPBSphosphate-buffered salineSLOstreptolysin OGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphatePPIpolyphosphoinositidesCHOChinese hamster ovary. and other peptide binding receptors, internalization is assessed by determining changes in the distribution of ligand using a technique of low pH removal of cell surface-associated ligand. Whereas, in the case of muscarinic and adrenergic receptors, sequestration is assessed by analyzing changes in the distribution of the receptor determined by comparing the binding of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ligands. Thus, it is unclear whether or not the processes responsible for ligand internalization observed in peptide binding receptors are equivalent to the processes responsible for the sequestration of muscarinic and adrenergic receptors. Consequently, little is currently known concerning the role of receptor G protein interactions in the regulation of the internalization of peptide binding receptors including the Bn receptor. bombesin acetylcholine polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline streptolysin O guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate polyphosphoinositides Chinese hamster ovary. bombesin acetylcholine polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline streptolysin O guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate polyphosphoinositides Chinese hamster ovary.

A. 1991; 88: 395-399Google Scholar) and m3 ACh (10Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Smith D.H. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3923-3929Google Scholar) receptors have been cloned, and sequence analysis shows that they belong to the serpentine G protein-linked family of receptors. These two receptors are both expressed on pancreatic acinar cells where they each couple to increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and intracellular Ca2+ and activate the secretion of digestive enzymes(11Gardner J.D. Jensen R.T. Go V.L.W. DiMagno E.P. Gardner J.D. Lebenthal E. Reber H.A. Scheele G.A. The Pancreas. Biology, Pathobiology, and Disease. Raven Press, New York1993: 151-166Google Scholar). Both receptors are generally believed to interact with the Gq subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins. However, in pancreatic acinar cells, Bn and m3 ACh receptors show dramatic differences in receptor properties, some of which may be influenced by G protein interactions. These properties include numbers of agonist affinity binding states (one versus two), secretory dose-response curves (monophasic versus biphasic), and ligand internalization (extensive versus minimal). In order to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the differences in these receptors, we wished to determine whether transfer of structural domains important for G protein-receptor interaction could transfer characteristics from one receptor to the other. The third cytoplasmic loop has been shown to dictate the specificity of receptor-G protein interactions in muscarinic and adrenergic receptors. Studies with chimeric muscarinic receptors indicate that the proximal 16-21 amino acids of the third cytoplasmic loop are sufficient to determine the G protein coupling profile of individual muscarinic receptor subtypes(12Lechleiter J. Hellmiss R. Duerson K. Ennulat D. David N. Clapham D. Peralta E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4381-4390Google Scholar, 13Wess J. Bonner T.I. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 872-877Google Scholar). Similarly, the juxtamembrane amino acids at the amino and carboxyl ends of the third cytoplasmic loop of adrenergic receptors were found to be most important for determination of G protein specificity(14Wong S.K. Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6219-6224Google Scholar, 15O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15985-15992Google Scholar). Furthermore, substitution of residues in the juxtamembrane portion of the third cytoplasmic domain of several receptors has been shown to induce an constitutively active confirmation(16Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Google Scholar). However, other studies have indicated that the second cytoplasmic loop is also important in receptor G protein interactions. O'Dowd et al.(15O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15985-15992Google Scholar) found that the second cytoplasmic loop was essential for normal β2-adrenergic receptor-Gαs interactions. Interactions between the second and third cytoplasmic loops were also found to be involved in fully determining G protein selectivity in chimeras of muscarinic and adrenergic receptors(14Wong S.K. Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6219-6224Google Scholar). Also, mutations in the second and third loops of rhodopsin suggested that activation of bound transducin requires interaction with a site in each of these two loops(17Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Graham R.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14767-14774Google Scholar). Collectively these data indicate that both the second and third cytoplasmic loops are important determinants of G protein-receptor interaction. Therefore, in the current study we created chimeric bombesin receptors with the second or third or both cytoplasmic loops substituted from the m3 ACh receptor. Cells expressing the receptors were then analyzed for differences in agonist affinity binding states, ligand internalization, and signal transduction. We found that the mutant receptors bound agonist with a single affinity state that was similar to the wild-type Bn receptor. However, Bn receptor mutants with the third cytoplasmic loop substituted from the m3 ACh receptor were severely diminished in their abilities to internalize ligand and to couple with second messenger formation.

CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The plasmid containing the 1.4-kilobase pair EcoRI DNA fragment of mouse bombesin receptor cDNA containing the entire 384-amino-acid open reading frame of the receptor was kindly provided by Dr. J. Battey(9Battey J.F. Way J.M. Corjay M.H. Shapira H. Kusano K. Harkins R. Wu J.M. Slattery T. Mann E. Feldman R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 395-399Google Scholar). The 1.4-kilobase pair EcoRI DNA fragment was subcloned into pBluescript SK- plasmid to obtain pBRR plasmid. The full-length of human m3 muscarinic receptor cDNA was a gift of Dr. E. Peralta (10Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Smith D.H. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3923-3929Google Scholar) and was cloned as a 2.1-kilobase pair EcoRI to BamHI DNA fragment into pGEM-3. PCR methodology was used to construct a chimeric receptor cDNA in which the third cytoplasmic loop of the mouse Bn receptor was replaced by the analogous portion of the human m3 muscarinic receptor. Steps in the construction of this mutated receptor were as follows: (a) Primers with sequences 5′-CTGTCTACTACTACTTCATTAGGATCTATAAGGAAACTGA-3′ (BR-Hm3-N) and 5′-CCCACAAACACCAGTACTGTCTGGGCCGCTTTCTTCTCCT-3′ (BR-Hm3-C) were used in a 30-cycle PCR reaction containing the m3 muscarinic receptor cDNA. This PCR reaction amplified a DNA fragment coding for the third cytoplasmic loop of the m3 ACh receptor fused at each end to sequences coding for the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments of the Bn receptor. (b) The chimeric DNA fragment from (a) was used in separate PCR reactions containing the Bn receptor with primers in each of the flanking regions of the plasmid. These reactions amplified a DNA fragment, which fused the third cytoplasmic loop of the m3 ACh receptor to the fifth transmembrane segment of the Bn receptor or the third cytoplasmic loop of m3 ACh receptor to the sixth transmembrane segment of Bn receptor. (c) The complete chimeric BM3L clone was formed using 20 ng each of these two PCR products to prime a 10-cycle PCR reaction followed by addition of the flanking primers and 30 additional PCR cycles. The final PCR reaction product was cut with EcoRI, and then the amplified chimeric bombesin/m3 muscarinic receptor DNA fragment was cloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript, and the DNA sequences were verified by sequencing. A similar PCR protocol was used to obtain the BM2L receptor chimera in which the entire second cytoplasmic loop of the human m3 ACh receptor was substituted for the corresponding portion of the Bn receptor. The two primers with sequences 5′-CACACTTACGGCACTGTCAGCTGACAGATACTTTTCATCAC-3′ and 5′-AAAGCAGCTTTGAGACAGATGGCTCTCTTTGTTGTTCGTT-3′ were used to amplify a DNA fragment coding for the second cytoplasmic loop of the m3 ACh receptor fused at each end to a sequence coding for the third and fourth transmembrane segments of the Bn receptor. To obtain the chimeric Bn receptor with both second and third cytoplasmic loops replaced by the analogous portions of the m3 ACh receptor, a 0.8-kilobase pair AccI DNA fragment containing the N-terminal portion to the end of the fifth transmembrane segment of BM2L was inserted into the AccI site of pBluescript plasmid containing the C-terminal portion of BM3L chimeric receptor to obtain the chimeric BM23L receptor. All receptors were subcloned into pTEJ-8 (19Johansen T.E. Choller M.S. Tolstoy S. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 289-294Google Scholar) for expression in cell lines. CHO-K1 cells were routinely cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For transfection, CHO-K1 cells were grown to 30-40% confluence in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 3 μg of PvuI-linearized plasmid DNA using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6-8 h in serum-free medium. Cells were then returned to 10% fetal bovine serum, cultured 36 h, and then removed from the dishes by brief trypsin EDTA treatment and replated at reduced density in 150-mm plates in the presence of 1 mg/ml (active) G418. G418-resistant colonies were selected and screened for bombesin and mutant receptors by binding of [125I-Tyr4]bombesin. Two or more clones were tested in all assays to control for clonal variation. Binding was conducted to cells plated in 24-well dishes at 1 × 105 cells/ml the day before the binding assay. For agonist cell binding assays [125I-Tyr4]bombesin (10 pM) was added to HR buffer (5 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1 mM Na2PO4, 1.28 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor).

Cells were incubated to equilibrium (2 h at 37°C) and then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were then scraped into 1 ml of 0.1 N NaOH and were counted in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 nM bombesin. Protein contents were determined on samples after counting. Binding affinity and capacity were calculated using the Ligand analysis program (20Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar) or with Prism (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). For determination of ligand internalization, we utilized an acid washing procedure. For acid washing experiments, after the PBS wash, the cells were given an additional wash with 1 ml of acid wash buffer (0.2 M acetic acid, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 2) at 4°C for 5 min, which was collected and counted separately from the cells. This wash was found to remove >90% of either agonist or antagonist tracer from the surface of cells after 4 h of binding at 4°C (data not shown). For analysis of the effects of GTPγS on binding properties of bombesin receptors, cells were permeabilized with SLO (0.4 IU/ml) in permeabilization buffer (120 mM KCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl, 1 mM MgATP, 1.078 mM CaCl2, glucose 5.6 mM, 30 mM Hepes (pH 7) with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) for 5 min at 37°C and then washed with the same buffer lacking SLO. Binding with [125I-Tyr4]bombesin was conducted in permeabilization buffer at 37°C for the indicated times. The cells were seeded at a concentration of 106 cells/well in a 6-well dish and grown to confluence. The cells were then washed on ice 3 times with ice-cold binding buffer without bovine serum albumin. [125I-Tyr4]Bombesin (0.5 nM) was added to the cells in 0.8 ml of binding buffer and incubated for 4 h on ice. The cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold binding buffer and once with PBS. The cross-linking reagent, EGS, was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted to 1 mM in PBS. One ml of PBS containing 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(succinic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the cells were washed once with PBS. Sample buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 100 mM dithiothreital, 60 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 0.001% bromphenol blue) (80 μl) preheated to 95°C was added to the cells, and the cells were scraped into an Eppendorff tube. The samples were boiled and separated on a 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed on Kodak XAR-5 film for 2 weeks at −70°C. For measurement of total inositol phosphate release, cells were cultured in 6-well multiwell dishes at 1 × 106 cells/ml for 24 h in the presence of 1.5 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol. The cells were then washed twice with HR buffer containing 10 mM lithium. Incubation with the indicated concentrations of bombesin was conducted in the same buffer for the times indicated. Incubation was terminated by addition of an equal volume of 20% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 2000 × g for 20 min, 0.9 ml of each supernatant was washed twice with water-saturated diethyl ether, neutralized with 100 μl of 1 M KHCO3, and diluted with 2.5 ml of water. Analysis of total [3H]inositol phosphates was carried out by the method described by Berridge et al.(21Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 849-858Google Scholar). For measurement of arachidonic acid release, cells grown to near confluency in 6-well plates were incubated with 1 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid for 24 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in HR buffer plus or minus bombesin (10 nM) for 30 min. The incubation medium was then removed and counted in a scintillation counter. Analysis of intracellular [Ca2+]i was conducted on cells grown to 30-50% confluence on glass coverslips. Cells were incubated with 5 μM fura-2 at 37°C for 30 min in an incubator and then washed and resuspended in HR buffer. Coverslips containing cells were transferred to a closed chamber, mounted on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope, and continuously superfused at 1 ml/min with HR buffer at 37°C. Measurement of emitted fluorescence and calibration of these signals to yield a measurement of intracellular Ca2+ was performed using an Attofluor digital imaging system (Rockville, MD) exactly as described previously(22Yule D.I. Tseng M. Williams J.A. Logsdon C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G999-G1004Google Scholar). Cells were scored as to whether or not they showed a response to the addition of 10 nM bombesin to the superfusate. All values were represented as the mean ± S.E. Student's two-tailed t test, unpaired, or when appropriate, paired, was used for statistical analysis of the data. In order to investigate the structural basis for differences between Bn and m3 ACh receptors, PCR technology was utilized to produce chimeric bombesin receptors bearing the second, third, or both cytoplasmic loops from the m3 ACh receptor. A schematic representation of the putative seven membrane-spanning domain topography of the bombesin receptor, the m3 muscarinic receptor (m3 ACh) and the chimeric bombesin/m3 muscarinic receptors with the second (BM2L), third (BM3L), or both (BM23L) cytoplasmic loops transfered from the m3 ACh into the Bn receptor are shown in Fig. 1. Nucleotide sequences were confirmed by sequencing. To obtain CHO-K1 cell lines with stable expression of Bn or chimeric bombesin/m3 muscarinic receptors cells transfected with the receptor, cDNAs cloned into the pTEJ-8 expression vector were selected with G418. Stable expression of receptors was confirmed by [125I-Tyr4]bombesin binding assays. Northern blot hybridization of mRNA isolated from transfected cells and hybridized with a radiolabeled bombesin receptor cDNA probe or a probes for the cytoplasmic loops of the m3 muscarinic receptor confirmed the transcription of the receptors' genes in the transfected CHO cells (data not show). To confirm the expression of the BM3L mutant phenotype, the Bn and BM3L cell lines were labeled with [125I-Tyr4]bombesin and cross-linked with"

In order to elucidate which domains of the IHF protein are involved in these interactions, we have constructed mutant proteins in which the C-terminal part of one of the subunits has been deleted. We observed that the C-terminal α3 helix of HimD is involved in the stability of DNA binding, but not in the specificity. In contrast the corresponding α3 helix of HimA is essential for the sequence specificity, since an IHF mutant lacking this domain only binds to the DNA in a nonspecific way. The possible role of the two C-terminal α-helical structures in complex formation will be discussed.We also examined the properties of an IHF mutant that has an amino acid substitution between β sheets β1 and β2 of the HimD subunit (R46H). The occupancy of the ihf site by the mutant and wild type proteins differ in the 3′ part of the ihf site and as a result the bend introduced in the DNA by the mutant protein is less pronounced.

Integration host factor (IHF)1 1The abbreviations used are: IHFintegration host factorbpbase pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: IHFintegration host factorbpbase pair(s). is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, first identified as an accessory protein for the integration of λ DNA in the chromosome of Escherichia coli(4Miller H.I. Friedman D.I. Bukhari A. Shapiro J. Adhya S. DNA Insertion Elements, Plasmids, and Episomes. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1977: 349-356Google Scholar, 5William J.G.K. Wulff D.L. Nash H.A. Bukhari A. Shapiro J. Adhya S. DNA Insertion Elements, Plasmids, and Episomes. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1977: 357-362Google Scholar). The protein plays also an important role in a variety of cellular processes, such as transposition, DNA replication, DNA packaging, and control of gene expression (for reviews, see (6Friedman D.I. Cell. 1988; 55: 545-554Google Scholar, 7Freundlich M. Ramani N. Mathew E. Sirko A. Tsui P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2557-2563Google Scholar, 8Goosen N. van de Putte P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1-7Google Scholar)). IHF is a heterodimeric protein composed of two non-identical but homologous subunits, α ((11Drlica K. Rouvire-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Google Scholar); 35 kDa) and β ((10Flamm E.L. Weisberg R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 117-128Google Scholar); 65 kDa), encoded by the himA and himD genes(9Miller H.I. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 691-698Google Scholar, 10Flamm E.L. Weisberg R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 117-128Google Scholar). These subunits are small basic proteins that also share homologies with the subunits of the E. coli HU protein, another member of the group of histone-like proteins to which IHF belongs(11Drlica K. Rouvire-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Google Scholar). Although IHF can replace HU in some processes (12Morisato D. Kleckner N. Cell. 1987; 51: 101-111Google Scholar, 13Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Google Scholar), the binding properties of the two proteins are different. HU binds the DNA in a nonspecific way, and multiple protomers can bind to a DNA fragment with about one dimer for each 9 bp(14Bonnefoy E. Rouvire-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 687-696Google Scholar). In contrast, IHF recognizes a specific sequence: WATCAANNNNTTR2 2W is either T or A, and R is A or G. N represents any of the four nucleotides. 2W is either T or A, and R is A or G. N represents any of the four nucleotides.(15Craig N. Nash H.A. Cell. 1984; 39: 707-716Google Scholar, 16Goodrich J.A. Schwartz M.L. McClure M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4993-5000Google Scholar), and only one IHF protein is bound per ihf site protecting a DNA sequence of approximately 30 bp(1Yang C. Nash H.A. Cell. 1989; 57: 869-880Google Scholar). integration host factor base pair(s). integration host factor base pair(s). Both HU and IHF are DNA-bending proteins. The crystal structure of the HU protein of Bacillus stearothermophilus has been resolved (17Tanaka I. Appelt K. Dijk J. White S.W. Wilson K.S. Nature. 1984; 310: 376-381Google Scholar, 18White S.W. Appelt K. Wilson K.S. Tanaka I. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 5: 281-288Google Scholar). From this three-dimensional structure, a model has been proposed for interaction of HU with the DNA. In this model, the two exposed β-ribbon arms encircle the DNA. Then through protein-protein interactions between the adjacent domains of the bound protomers of HU, a bend is introduced in the DNA. Combining the structural model for HU and the footprint data of IHF, the following model for the binding of IHF to DNA has been proposed(1Yang C. Nash H.A. Cell. 1989; 57: 869-880Google Scholar); the extended arms bind to the DNA through interactions within the minor groove, and in addition, the DNA flanking these minor groove regions interact with the body of the protein to stabilize the pronounced bend which has been estimated to be over 140°(19Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Google Scholar). In this way, the IHF protein makes contact with the DNA beyond the consensus sequence and these surrounding sequences have been shown to be important for the stability of the IHF-DNA complex (16Goodrich J.A.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 305-313Google Scholar), it became clear that the arm of the HimA subunit is in direct contact with the WATCAA part of the consensus while the flank of the HimD subunit interacts with the TTR sequence of the consensus(3Lee E.C. Hales L.M. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 305-313Google Scholar). In this paper, we analyzed which parts of the HimD protein might be responsible for a direct contact with the consensus. We present evidence that the turn between β sheets 1 and 2 interacts with the TTR part of the consensus and that this interaction is important for the bending of the DNA. Strains AB1157, PP1953 (AB1157, himD), and PP1954 (AB1157, himA) have been described previously(26van Rijn P.A. Goosen N. van de Putte P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10203-10211Google Scholar). Bacterial strains used in this study for overproduction of proteins were derivatives of E. coli B strain BL21 in which the T7 RNA polymerase gene is under the control of the lac promoter(27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). In this strain, the himA and himD mutations were introduced by means of P1 transduction using PP1953 and PP1954 as donor strains, resulting in PP2895 (ompT, rBMB, himA::Tet) and PP2896 (ompT, rBMB, himD157, Tet insertion next to himD gene). The himA himD double mutant was constructed by P1 transduction using K2704 (10Flamm E.L. Weisberg R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 117-128Google Scholar) as donor and PP2895 as an acceptor resulting in PP3363 (ompT, rBMB, himA::Tet, himD::Cam). All strains were grown in Luria broth (28Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-435Google Scholar) containing the appropriate antibiotics (80 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol). The HimA- and HimD-overproducing plasmids pGP1138, pGP1104, and pGP1149 have been described previously (23Zulianello L. de la Gorgue de Rosny E. van Ulsen P. van de Putte P. Goosen N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1534-1540Google Scholar). The HimAΔ8- and HimDΔ4-overproducing plasmids were constructed by the introduction of a stop codon at position 273 and 270 in the himA and himD reading frames, respectively. The oligonucleotides CTGTAGACGGATCCTTAGACCCGGCTTTTTAAC and CGGGAGACGGATCCTTAGGCGCGATCGCGCGAGT were used for this site-directed mutagenesis by polymerase chain reaction. The amplified products were cloned under the control of the T7 promoter in pGP1104 and pGP1149 resulting in pGP1311 and pGP1312, which produce proteins without 7 or 4 amino acids of the C terminus of HimA and HimD, respectively. In a similar way, the HimAΔ15- and HimDΔ10-overproducing plasmids were obtained after polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using primers AACCCGGCTTGTCGACTACTGCCCGGGTC and CTGTAGACGGATCCTTATTTACCAGGTTTAAAG to introduce a stop codon at position 255 of the coding sequence of himA and at position 252 for himD, resulting in pGP1309 and pGP1310, which express the genes under the pT7 control. The subunits that are encoded lack 15 and 10 amino acids of the C terminus of HimA and HimD, respectively. The HimD-R46H mutant (Fig. 1) was obtained from a collection of randomly isolated IHF mutants.4 4L. Zulianello, P. van Ulsen, P. van de Putte, and N. Goosen, unpublished data. For the construction of the R46H-overproducing plasmid, the NdeI-BamHI fragment containing himD with the corresponding mutation was inserted in pGP1149(23Zulianello L. de la Gorgue de Rosny E. van Ulsen P. van de Putte P. Goosen N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1534-1540Google Scholar). Plasmid pGP133, containing the ihf site of bacteriophage Mu, which was described previously by van Rijn et al.(26van Rijn P.A. Goosen N. van de Putte P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10203-10211Google Scholar), was used for retardation assays and footprint experiments. After overproduction, HimD and its derivatives form aggregates in the cells which can be dissolved in urea. Therefore, all dimeric proteins were purified by mixing the lysates of strains in which the separate subunits were overexpressed in buffer B (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, containing 100 mM KCl and 8 M urea). The lysates were subsequently dialyzed in buffer B containing 100 mM KCl to remove the urea and to allow the reconstitution of the heterodimer. The HimAΔ8-HimD dimer was purified by mixing the lysates from PP2895 with pGP1311 and with pPG1149; the HimA-HimDΔ4 heterodimeric protein was purified by mixing the lysates from PP2896 with pGP1138 and with pGP1312; in the same way, the HimAΔ15-HimD protein was purified from mixed lysates from PP2895 containing the plasmids pGP1309 and pGP1149, while HimA-HimDΔ10 was isolated from PP2896 with the plasmids pGP1138 and pGP1310. The HimA-HimDR46H (R46H) was purified from PP2896 containing pGP1140 and the HimDR46H-overproducing plasmid. The purification of the proteins was as described for wild type IHF (23Zulianello L. de la Gorgue de Rosny E. van Ulsen P. van de Putte P. Goosen N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1534-1540Google Scholar) using P-11 phosphocellulose, heparin, and FPLC-MonoS columns. During purification, the HimAΔ8-HimD and HimA-HimDΔ4 dimers behaved like IHF while the other mutants were eluted at lower salt concentrations. Plasmid pGP133 was digested with HindIII (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), providing a 180-bp DNA fragment of the regulatory region of phage Mu with the ihf binding site (Fig. 2). The DNA was end-labeled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Pharmacia) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.). As a control fragment the 200-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment of Mu, which is adjacent to the ihf-containing fragment, was used (Fig. 2). To avoid contamination with the 180-bp fragment, pGP133 was first digested with HindIII and the vector fragment was separated from the 180-bp fragment. Next the isolated vector fragment was digested with EcoRI. The deletion of the TTR sequence of the consensus was obtained by digesting the 180-bp HindIII fragment with MluI, followed by filling in of the sticky ends by Klenow enzyme (Pharmacia). Dilutions of the proteins were made in buffer B containing 100 mM KCl. Binding reactions (10 μl) consisted of 3-5 fmol of DNA and the indicated amounts of protein in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mM KCl, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, after which 2 μl of loading buffer (25% Ficoll containing 0.04% of bromphenol blue) was added, and subsequently the samples were loaded on to a 5% polyacrylamide gel, which was run at 4°C. The gels were dried, and the DNA was visualized by autoradiography. ClaI-HindIII fragments corresponding to the Mu sequence from position 818 to 1004 (Fig. 2) were labeled at the 3′-end of the HindIII site using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP. The labeled fragments were purified on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Reactions of 20 μl containing the labeled fragment and different concentrations of protein were incubated for 10 min. at room temperature in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 3 mM CaCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Then 0.01 unit of DNase I (Pharmacia) was added and the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 5 min before it was quenched with 11 μl of the stop solution (1 μg/μl calf thymus DNA, 200 mM sodium acetate, pH 8.0, 75 mM EDTA). Dried samples were resuspended in sequence loading buffer (80% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) and electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide sequence gel. The gels were dried, and the footprint patterns were visualized by autoradiography. When the amino acid sequences of the HimA and HimD subunits are compared to those of the subunits of the homologous HU protein, it appears that the C-terminal parts of HimA and HimD are more extended (Fig. 1). Whereas the HU subunits contain 1-3 amino acids beyond the C-terminal α helix, the HimA and HimD proteins from E. coli have 8 and 4 residues in this region, respectively. The subunits of IHF from Serratia marcescens and Rhodobacter capsulatus also possess such extended C-terminal regions. To investigate whether the extended C-terminal regions participate in the binding specificity of IHF, we have deleted these regions (Fig. 1) by introduction of a stop codon in the reading frames of the himA and himD genes. The proteins have been purified as heterodimers: HimAΔ8-HimD and HimA-HimDΔ4 (Fig. 3), according to the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” Throughout purification, both truncated proteins behaved as the wild type protein and exhibited the same elution pattern as IHF. We have examined the DNA binding properties of the truncated IHF proteins by gel retardation experiments using a 180-bp HindIII fragment that contains the ihf sequence of the regulatory region of bacteriophage Mu. Fig. 4 shows that HimAΔ8-HimD and HimA-HimDΔ4 can still stably bind to the DNA. The affinity for the DNA might be slightly reduced for the mutants (a factor of 4) but they still bind to the ihf site in a very specific way. Moreover, the mutant protein-DNA complexes migrate at the same position within the gel as the wild type IHF-DNA complex, indicating that the bends introduced in the DNA by the truncated proteins or IHF are similar. The doubly truncated protein (HimAΔ8-HimDΔ4), that lacks both C-terminal extensions, also stably binds the DNA with a somewhat reduced affinity (data not shown). These results point out that the C-terminal extensions of HimA and HimD do not seem to be essential for the recognition of the ihf site or for the bending of the DNA. Next, we explored the contribution of the C-terminal α3 helices of HimA and HimD to the DNA binding since the position of the corresponding helices in the HU protein suggests that they might be candidates for interacting with the DNA, possibly thereby stabilizing the bend of the DNA (Fig. 9). First we constructed a himA deletion mutant that encodes a protein lacking the C-terminal 15 amino acids comprising the complete last α helix (Fig. 1), and we purified the HimAΔ15-HimD heterodimer (Fig. 3). The binding capacity of the mutant IHF protein that lacks the last α helix of the HimA subunit was analyzed by a gel retardation assay with the 180-bp HindIII fragment. As shown in Fig. 5, no specific complex with the DNA could be detected using the mutant protein. Only at very high protein concentrations, a low mobility complex was observed, probably representing the nonspecific binding of the mutant protein to the DNA since at the same concentrations also the vector fragment is shifted in the gel. To test this, we analyzed the binding of the wild type and mutant IHF to a 200-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment of phage Mu DNA (Fig. 2), adjacent to the ihf-containing fragment and which does not contain an IHF binding site. As seen in Fig. 5B, IHF can bind to this DNA fragment, but a much higher concentration of protein is needed to observe this nonspecific binding as compared to the specific binding. Moreover, the binding affinities of the wild type and mutant protein for the nonspecific DNA are the same. We conclude from these results that although the mutant protein exhibits no preferential binding to the ihf target sequence, its general DNA binding capacity is not lost. This may indicate that, in the absence of the C-terminal 15 amino acids of the HimA subunit, the overall conformation of the HimAΔ15-HimD protein still resembles that of the wild type IHF. To investigate the role of the last α helix in HimD, we constructed a himD deletion mutant encoding a truncated protein that lacks the C-terminal 10 amino acids, including the α3 helix. The HimA-HimDΔ10 heterodimeric protein was purified (Fig. 3), and the binding to the ihf-containing fragment was examined (Fig. 6). In contrast to IHF lacking the α3 helix of HimA, IHF lacking the α3 of HimD does show specific binding to the ihf site, although the affinity is reduced with respect to wild type IHF by about a factor of 50-100. The DNA-mutant complex migrates at the same position as the wild type complex, indicating that the DNA bend is also not affected by the absence of the α3 helix of HimD. In addition, from footprint analysis (data not shown) it appears that the occupancy of the ihf region by the mutant and wild type proteins are identical again suggesting that they form similar complexes. Apparently, the C-terminal part of HimD is not essential for recognition of the ihf site and for formation of the proper complex. The reduced binding affinity of the mutant protein, however, indicates that the last α helix of HimD does play a role in the stability of DNA binding. This might be accomplished through direct interaction with the DNA, or through stabilization of an other DNA binding domain of the IHF protein. On the basis of the model of the HU structure, an other prominent candidate for interaction with the DNA can be indicated: the turn between β sheets 1 and 2 of both subunits. From our collection of randomly isolated IHF mutants, 5P. van Ulsen, manuscript in preparation. one mutant protein, which has a substitution in this region of the HimD subunit (R46H), was chosen for further analysis. The protein was purified as a dimeric protein (Fig. 3), and the binding property of the mutant was analyzed with a retardation assay using the 180-bp HindIII fragment. At the salt conditions that are normally used in our DNA binding experiments (75 mM KCl), the mutant protein binds with an extremely low efficiency to the ihf site (Fig. 7A). To observe a comparable binding as the wild type IHF, about 400 times more mutant protein is needed. The affinity is increased at low salt conditions (0-10 mM KCl), but it is still about 10 times lower than that of wild type IHF (Fig. 7B). Surprisingly, however, we observed in both cases that the R46H-DNA complex migrates faster in the gel than the wild type IHF-DNA complex. Since it has been shown that the migration of the protein-DNA complex in a gel is correlated to the degree of bending introduced in the DNA(29Wu H. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Google Scholar), this could indicate that the DNA in the mutant complex is bent to a lesser extent. To analyze the mutant protein-DNA complex further, we performed a DNase I footprint with R46H on the upper strand of the 180-bp fragment that contains the ihf sequence (Fig. 8). In the presence of R46H, a clear protection of the DNA is observed but only in the absence of KCl and at higher concentration of protein as compared to the wild type. No protection of the ihf-containing fragment was detected in the presence of 75 mM of salt (data not shown). The binding of the mutant in absence of salt might indicate a defect in electrostatic interactions, which could stabilize either the protein conformation or the DNA-protein complex. As shown in Fig. 8, the protection patterns of the mutant and wild type proteins are very similar, except that one nucleotide, at the 3′ side, is no longer protected by the mutant protein. This unprotected nucleotide maps at position 962 of the DNA sequence (Fig. 2). This position is close to the TTR region of the ihf consensus, which might indicate that the R46H mutation affects the interaction of the IHF protein with this region, and as result the DNA could be bent to a lesser extent. To investigate whether indeed the β-turn of HimD interacts with the 3′ part of the ihf consensus sequence, the TTA sequence was deleted from the Mu ihf site. This was achieved by cutting of the 180-bp DNA fragment with MluI, leading to a fragment of 140 bp (Fig. 2). When the DNA fragment was used without a subsequent Klenow treatment, no binding of the wild type protein could be obtained (data not shown), whereas, as shown in Fig. 7C, after filling in of the recessive ends, IHF binds specifically to the truncated ihf sequence but with a lower affinity as compared to the intact sequence. This result suggests that the CGCG end of the fragment has to be double stranded in order to form a specific complex. The complex with the truncated ihf site is less retarded as compared to the complex with the 180-bp fragment. It is difficult to show whether the bending of the DNA is changed, since the ihf site is now located at the end of the fragment, where the bending contributes much less to the mobility in the gel(20Stenzel T.T. Patel P. Bastia D. Cell. 1987; 49: 709-717Google Scholar, 21Gamas P. Chandler M.G. Prentki P. Galas D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 261-272Google Scholar). Mutant R46H is also capable to bind to the truncated ihf site that was obtained after Klenow treatment (Fig. 7D) but again in the absence of KCl. Under these conditions, the wild type and mutant proteins bind with comparable affinities to the DNA fragment lacking the TTA part of the consensus. This could indicate that the R46H mutant is specifically disturbed in interaction with this DNA region. In conclusion, our results point out that the turn between β sheets 1 and 2 of HimD might be in close contact with the TTR part of the consensus and, as judged from the retardation assay, this interaction might contribute to the bending of the DNA. According to the recent model that is based on both genetic and biochemical analyses(1Yang C. Nash H.A. Cell. 1989; 57: 869-880Google Scholar, 2Granston A.E. Nash H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 45-59Google Scholar, 3Lee E.C. Hales L.M. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 305-313Google Scholar), IHF binds to the DNA through minor groove interactions between the arm of HimA and the WATCAA part of the consensus and the arm of HimD and the 5′ side of the consensus. The body of the IHF protein makes additional contacts with the DNA flanking the arm-binding region, and these contacts probably stabilize the bend that is introduced in the DNA. In this paper we present evidence that the turn between β sheets 1 and 2 of HimD interacts with the 3′ part (TTR) of the consensus. The DNase I footprint pattern of a mutant protein, which contains a substitution in this turn-region of the HimD subunit (R46H), shows that the interaction of this IHF mutant with the 3′ part of the consensus is partly disturbed. As a consequence the DNA seems to be bent to a lesser extent by the mutant as compared to the wild type, as judged from the faster mobility of the mutant complex in a gel retardation assay. Although the R46H substitution also seemed to affect the conformation of the protein when incubated at high salt conditions, its direct effect on the interaction with the 3′ part of the consensus became clear when gel retardation was performed with the Mu ihf site in which the 3′ TTA sequence was deleted. The wild type and mutant IHF proteins bind to such a truncated site with comparable affinities, indicating that the mutation specifically affects the interaction of IHF with this TTA sequence. This indicates that residue Arg-46 of the wild type HimD subunit, which is conserved in all HimD proteins known so far, is in close contact with the TTA part of the ihf site, and its positive charge might possibly serve to neutralize the negative charge of the phosphates in this DNA region. The arginine residue might also be more directly involved in recognition of the TTA sequence, since for different proteins it has been shown that arginine side chains interact with the minor groove of specific DNA sequences. The PRGRPK motif of the HMGI/Y protein for instance makes with the arginine side chains specific contacts in the minor groove of the AAATTT sequence(30Geierstanger B.H. Volkman B.F. Kremer W. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5347-5355Google Scholar). The arginine side chains of the N-terminal arm of the engrailed homeodomain (RPRTAFS) make minor groove contacts with the TAAT sequence (31Kissinger C.R. Liu B. Martin-Blanco E. Kornberg T.B. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1990; 63: 579-590Google Scholar) and the first arginine of the extended polypeptide chain of the DNA binding domain of the Hin protein (GRPRAITKH) is located in the minor groove where it interacts with a specific A-T base pair of the binding site(32Feng J.-A. Johnson R.C. Dickerson R.E. Science. 1994; 263: 348-355Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, it has recently been reported that the turn between β sheets 1 and 2 of the HimA subunit might be directly involved in contacting the DNA in the 5′ non-consensus half of the IHF-binding region of the H′ site of phage λ. This was shown by photocross-linking of this DNA region to a region of the HimA protein from residues 45-54, which comprises the turn region. Interestingly, the turn of the HimA subunit contains a serine residue at the position corresponding to Arg-46 in HimD. This serine is also conserved in all HimA proteins that have been analyzed until now. It is not known whether this serine residue makes direct contacts with the DNA, since residue Gly-49 was indicated as the major site for the cross-linking. If the serine is involved in a direct contact with the DNA, it might be through sequence-independent interactions with the phosphate backbone. Although the TTR (TTA in the case of the Mu ihf site) part of the ihf consensus forms an important determinant for IHF binding, we have shown that a specific IHF-DNA complex can still be formed when a truncated DNA fragment is used that lacks this sequence, albeit with a much lower affinity. When, however, the 4 nucleotides located between the TATCAA and the TTA part are removed, no specific complex is obtained. Apparently these four nucleotides have an important function in complex formation, probably because they also participate in contacts with the IHF protein. Such contacts would be mediated by the phosphates of the sequence, since comparison of known ihf sequences does not show nucleotide preferences in this region(16Goodrich J.A. Schwartz M.L. McClure M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4993-5000Google Scholar). If the arm of HimA contacts the TATCAA region and the turn between β1 and β2 of HimD contacts the TTA region, then the C-terminal part of HimD with the α3 helix and the 4 amino acids extension would be a good candidate to interact with the sequence in between (Fig. 9). We have shown that deletion of the 4 C-terminal amino acids of HimD have only a minor effect on IHF binding. This is in agreement with the observation that substitution of these 4 residues have no effect on the function of IHF in vivo(10Flamm E.L. Weisberg R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 117-128Google Scholar). The additional deletion of the α3 helix of HimD did reduce the binding affinity, but specific IHF-DNA complexes could still be formed. These properties would fit with a role for the α3 helix in interacting with the DNA that separates the two parts of the consensus, since the arm- and turn-interactions would still allow the formation of the specific complex. The recent observation that the α3 helix of HimD can be functionally replaced by the α3 helix of HU (33Goldenberg D. Giladi H. Oppenheim A.B. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 941-950Google Scholar) would be consistent with this model. On the other hand, it is very well possible that the α3 helix of HimD has an indirect role in the stability of the IHF-DNA complex through interaction with another part of the IHF protein. This seems certainly to be the case for the α3 helix of the HimA subunit. Deletion of this domain from HimA has a much more drastic effect on IHF, since it completely loses its ability to bind to the ihf site. The affinity for nonspecific DNA however does seem comparable to that of normal IHF. We do not regard it as very likely that these properties reflect a direct function for the α3 helix of HimA in recognizing the consensus sequence. If the α3 helix would contact the DNA, it would be with the DNA region that is located between the sequences that could be cross-linked to the arm of HimD and to the turn-region of HimD (34Yang S.-W. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12183-12187Google Scholar) (Fig. 9). The sequence of this region does not show a significant similarity score when different ihf sites are compared, indicating that it is not a determinant in ihf site recognition. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the α3 helix of HimA contributes to the stability of the IHF-DNA complex by interacting with the DNA, its role in the specificity of binding is probably indirect by stabilizing the structure of other DNA binding domains. For the homologous histone-like protein TF1 from Bacillus subtilis, it has been described that the 9-amino acid region that extends beyond the C-terminal α3 helix is important for specificity of SPO1 DNA binding(35Sayre M.H. Geiduschek E.P. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3455-3462Google Scholar). Recent NMR analysis (36Jia X. Reisman J.M. Hsu V. Geiduschek E.P. Parello J. Kearns D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8842-8852Google Scholar) has indicated that this 9-amino acid tail of TF1 also adopts an α-helical conformation. The elongated α-helical region of one TF1 subunit shows numerous NOE contacts with the arm domain of the other subunit and with the turn between the α2 helix and the β1 sheet of the other subunit. The HimA subunit also contains a C-terminal extension, but we have shown that this extension does not contribute to the specificity of IHF binding, whereas the α3 helix does. The proposed stabilizing function of this α3 helix could be mediated in two ways. It could either stabilize the structure of the HimD arm through direct interaction with this domain. Since the α3 helix is at the end of the HimA arm, it could also stabilize the structure of this arm through interaction with the turn between α2 and β1 of HimD, thereby anchoring the HimA arm to the body of the protein. IHF is a heterodimeric protein with two subunits that share only 25% amino acid identity. For the model of the IHF-DNA complex, however, the structure of the symmetrical HU homodimer is used. Although the cross-linking data of Yang and Nash(34Yang S.-W. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12183-12187Google Scholar), combined with the binding properties of the R46H mutant that are described in this study, strongly argue for a symmetrical wrapping of the DNA around the IHF molecule with similar domains of each subunit interacting with the DNA, the intrinsic asymmetry of the IHF molecule might be important for the complex formation. The differential effect that we observe after deleting either the α3 helix of HimA or the α3 helix of HimD might be a reflection of such an asymmetry.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1439-1445Google Scholar) and is thereby actively involved in controlling cell migration and tissue remodeling (34Ossowski L. Reich E. Cell. 1983; 35: 611-619Google Scholar). Plasminogen consists of an NH2-terminal 77-residue domain, five internally homologous kringle domains, and a COOH-terminally located serine protease domain (46Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Zajdel M. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Prog. Chem. Fibrinolysis Thrombolysis. 1978; 3: 191-209Google Scholar). Some of the kringle domains are able to bind COOH-terminal Lys residues found in several plasma and cell-surface proteins (15Harpel P.C. Chang T.S. Verderber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4432-4440Google Scholar). This is likely to be the basis for the specific interaction of plasminogen with fibrin (49Thorsen S. Clemmensen I. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 668: 377-387Google Scholar; 48Suenson E. Lutzen O. Thorsen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 513-522Google Scholar; 15Harpel P.C. Chang T.S. Verderber E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 12302-12307Google Scholar), thrombospondin (44Silverstein R.L. Leung L.L.K. Harpel P.C. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1625-1633Google Scholar), and the extracellular matrix of vascular tissues (19Knudsen B.S. Silverstein R.L. Leung L.L.K. Harpel P.C. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10765-10771Google Scholar) as well as a number of vascular cell surfaces (31Miles L.A. Levin E.G. Plescia J. Collen D. Plow E.F. Blood. 1988; 72: 628-635Google Scholar; 14Hajjar K.A. Harpel P.C. Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11656-11662Google Scholar). It has become a basic concept that the interaction of plasminogen with protein matrices and cell surfaces plays a key role in the regulation of plasminogen activation, so plasmin activity is restricted to sites where its proteolytic activity is required (33Nachman R.L. Blood. 1992; 79: 1897-1906Google Scholar). We have recently found that plasminogen is a substrate for transglutaminases from plasma as well as tissues. These enzymes cross-link plasminogen into high molecular weight homopolymers and also cross-link plasminogen to fibronectin, a major constituent of the extracellular matrix of vascular tissues (4Bendixen E. Borth W. Harpel P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21962-21967Google Scholar). Transglutaminases are Ca2+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the cross-linking of certain Gln and Lys side chains in proteins, resulting in the formation of ∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysyl bridges. Transglutaminases are ubiquitously found in tissues and body fluids (for a review, see 22Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Google Scholar). The best characterized transglutaminase is plasma transglutaminase Factor XIIIa, formed from its precursor, Factor XIII, by activation with thrombin. It cross-links polymerized fibrin into a tight matrix during the final steps of blood coagulation (23Lorand L. Losowsky M.S. Miloszewski K.J.M. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1980; 52: 245-290Google Scholar) and also cross-links α2-antiplasmin to the fibrin clot (39Sakata Y. Aoki N. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 290-297Google Scholar). The physiological roles of tissue transglutaminases are not understood. However, since several of their substrates are constituents of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane of vascular tissues, transglutaminases are believed to play a major role in the formation and stabilization of these matrices (27Martinez J. Rich E. Barsigian C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20502-20508Google Scholar; 17Kinsella M.G. Wright T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17891-17898Google Scholar; 41Sane D.C. Moser T.L. Greenberg C.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11316-11321Google Scholar). It has previously been suggested that plasminogen cross-linked into high molecular weight homopolymers may also be cross-linked to the extracellular matrix as well and that this cross-linking of plasminogen may represent a novel mechanism by which plasmin activity is targeted to the extracellular matrix of vascular tissues (4Bendixen E. Borth W. Harpel P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21962-21967Google Scholar). We report here the identification of the major cross-linking site in plasminogen involved in its transglutaminase-catalyzed polymerization. The site has been identified by comparison of HPLC1 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPTHphenylthiohydantoindansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPTHphenylthiohydantoindansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. profiles of tryptic peptides of monomeric and cross-linked plasminogens, and from sequence analysis, it is found to be constituted by Lys-298 and Gln-322 located in the kringle 3 domain. high performance liquid chromatography dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phenylthiohydantoin 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. high performance liquid chromatography dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phenylthiohydantoin 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. Human plasminogen (90 kDa) was purified as described earlier (46Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Zajdel M. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Prog. Chem. Fibrinolysis Thrombolysis. 1978; 3: 191-209Google Scholar). Guinea pig liver transglutaminase (75 kDa) was from Sigma. 1-Chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone-treated trypsin was from Worthington. Standard chemicals were analytical grade and were obtained from Merck, Fluka, and Sigma. ∊-(γ-Glutamyl)lysine was from Sigma. Packing materials for reverse-phase and ion-exchange HPLC were from Machery Nagel, Phase Separations, and PolyLC, Inc. A Mono S HR 5/5 column was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Reagents and solvents for sequence analysis were from Applied Biosystems, Inc. 550 nmol (50 mg) of human plasminogen was incubated with 2.75 nmol (0.208 mg) of guinea pig liver tissue transglutaminase in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+, 0.5 mM DTT, and 50 mM Tris-buffered saline at pH 7.5. The total volume was 50 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of transglutaminase, proceeded for 1 h at 20°C with end-over-end mixing, and was stopped by the addition of 20 mM EDTA. For SDS-PAGE, the Tris/glycine system of 21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar was used with 0.5 × 80 × 100-mm 10-20% gradient gels. ~200-μg aliquots of cross-linked plasminogen or untreated plasminogen were digested with a mixture of endo- and exopeptidases using the procedure of 13Griffin M. Wilson J. Lorand L. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 124: 406-413Google Scholar. Because ∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysine elutes close to methionine in the amino acid analysis system used (45Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 789-794Google Scholar), samples were oxidized with performic acid prior to analysis. The concentrations of the plasminogen solutions were determined by amino acid analysis after hydrolysis with 6 M HCl for 18 h at 110°C. Plasminogen cross-linked as described above or native plasminogen was reduced by adding 5 mM DTT in the presence of 6 M guanidinium chloride at pH 9.0. Reduction proceeded at 20°C for 30 min, where after all free sulfhydryl groups were blocked by reaction with 20 mM iodoacetic acid for 30 min at pH 8.0. The reduced and alkylated samples were desalted by repeated dialysis against 50 mM NH4HCO3, and digestion of plasminogen (37°C, 12 h) was performed by adding trypsin (1:100, w/w) in 50 mM NH4HCO3 (total volume of 150 ml). The peptide material was freeze-dried, redissolved in 25 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and stored as aliquots at −20°C. Separations of tryptic peptides derived from either cross-linked or monomeric plasminogen were performed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Hewlett-Packard 1084 B instrument. Columns (4 × 250 mm) were packed with 5-μm Nucleosil C-18 or 10-μm Vydac C-18 material and eluted with gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 50°C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored at 220 nm. For cation-exchange chromatography, an instrument assembled from Pharmacia Biotech HPLC modules was used. Separations were performed on a 4 × 120-mm polysulfoethyl-A column and on a Mono S column using a gradient of NaCl in 25% (v/v) acetonitrile, 5 mM phosphoric acid (2Alpert A.J. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 443: 819-825Google Scholar; 8Crimmins D.L. Thoma R.S. McCourt D.W. Schwartz B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 255-260Google Scholar). Peptides were collected manually and dried in a Speed-Vac centrifuge. Edman degradation of selected peptides was performed using an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer with an on-line 120A HPLC apparatus. The Normal-1 reaction and conversion cycles were used, and initial yields of PTH-derivatives were 100-1000 pmol. A sample of plasminogen incubated without transglutaminase under the conditions used for cross-linking was desalted on Sephadex G-25 and immediately treated with 20 mM iodoacetamide at pH 8.0 for 1 h to block free sulfhydryl groups. The content of S-carboxymethylcysteine was determined after acid hydrolysis (45Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 789-794Google Scholar). Plasminogen incubated as described above was freed from reductant and treated with 0.5 mM 4-(aminosulfonyl)-7-fluoro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole to introduce a fluorescent label on the free sulfhydryl groups (51Toyo'oka T. Imai K. Anal. Chem. 1984; 56: 2461-2464Google Scholar). The remaining disulfide bridges were then reduced with 10 mM DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide in 6 M guanidine HCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl at pH 8.5. After tryptic digestion, the peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC as described above. The column effluents were monitored by recording the absorbance at 220 nm and by recording the fluorescence (excitation at 374 nm and emission at 500 nm (51Toyo'oka T. Imai K. Anal. Chem. 1984; 56: 2461-2464Google Scholar)) using a Hitachi F-1000 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 12-μl flow cell. Major fluorescent pools identified from the fluorescence profile were subjected to sequence analysis. The fluorescent Cys residues were identified by HPLC as described by 6Chin C.C.Q. Wold F. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 128-134Google Scholar. RasMol version 2.4 (Roger Sayle, Glaxo Research and Development) was run under Microsoft Windows and used to display the three-dimensional structure of human kringle 4 (32Mulichak A.M. Tulinsky A. Ravichandran K.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10576-10588Google Scholar). The program was obtained by anonymous FTP (ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk), and the coordinate file was from Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. From previous studies, we know that plasminogen is readily cross-linked into high molecular weight complexes by several transglutaminases (4Bendixen E. Borth W. Harpel P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21962-21967Google Scholar). The ∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysyl cross-links are stable in the currently used methods for reduction, digestion, and peptide separation. Therefore, to locate the sites of cross-linking, tryptic HPLC profiles of plasminogen cross-linked with guinea pig liver tissue transglutaminase were compared with those of untreated plasminogen. The novel peptides found in the digest of cross-linked plasminogen must contain the sites of cross-linking. Consequently, the yields of peptides that harbor the reactive Gln and Lys residues must be reduced when compared with those of untreated plasminogen. When sequencing a peptide containing an ∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysyl bridge, two NH2-terminal sequences of equimolar ratio are expected. Because the isopeptide bond is not cleaved during Edman degradation, the cross-linked pair of residues is released as bis-PTH-∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysine, which is easily distinguished from the normal PTH-derivatives in the standard HPLC separation (47Sottrup-Jensen L. Hansen H.F. Pedersen H.S. Kristensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17727-17737Google Scholar). To minimize the differences in the peptide profiles of cross-linked and native plasminogens, a batch of 100 mg of plasminogen was divided in two equal portions. One batch was incubated with guinea pig liver transglutaminase in the presence of Ca2+, while the other was incubated with Ca2+ only. The molar ratio of transglutaminase to plasminogen was 1:200, so peptides of transglutaminase origin would not be expected to interfere with the interpretation of the peptide profiles of tryptic plasminogen digests. Fig. 1 shows a reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of plasminogen incubated with or without transglutaminase. Plasminogen incubated with transglutaminase and Ca2+ was essentially completely cross-linked after 1 h of incubation and was retained at the top of the stacking gel (lane 3), while untreated plasminogen was still in the 90-kDa form (lane 2), identical to the starting material (lane 1). DTT was used in the cross-linking reaction to preserve the activity of guinea pig liver transglutaminase. Plasminogen incubated with 0.5 mM DTT as described above but in the absence of transglutaminase was found to contain 4.9 mol of S-carboxymethylcysteine/mol of protein (~10% of the content of halfcystine). To investigate whether this level of S-carboxymethylcysteine represented nearly full reduction of a limited set of disulfide bridges or whether a large number of bridges had randomly been reduced to a low extent, a sample of plasminogen was incubated with 0.5 mM DTT. Free sulfhydryl groups were tagged with a fluorescent label by reaction with 4-(aminosulfonyl)-7-fluoro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (51Toyo'oka T. Imai K. Anal. Chem. 1984; 56: 2461-2464Google Scholar), and after complete reduction and carboxamidomethylation, tryptic peptides were separated by the procedures used for the main digests (see below). It was found that the extent of reduction described above resulted from a low level of reduction of randomly distributed disulfide bridges in plasminogen (data not shown). To estimate the amount of cross-links, aliquots of both cross-linked and monomeric plasminogens were exhaustively digested with a mixture of endo- and exopeptidases (13Griffin M. Wilson J. Lorand L. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 124: 406-413Google Scholar). It was found by amino acid analysis that 0.6-0.8 mol of ∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysine was present per mol of cross-linked plasminogen, while untreated plasminogen, as expected, did not contain the isopeptide. The estimation of the amount of cross-link in plasminogen is not accurate because the small peak corresponding to ∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysine is located in the valley between the huge peaks corresponding to valine and isoleucine (45Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 789-794Google Scholar), but the data suggest that cross-linking results in the introduction of only 1 mol of isopeptide bond/mol of plasminogen. Both monomeric and cross-linked plasminogens were digested with trypsin. To ensure complete digestion, the two batches were first reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetic acid in the presence of guanidinium chloride. To investigate whether the cross-links in transglutaminase-treated plasminogen could be identified by comparison of the tryptic peptide profiles, identical aliquots of the digests were separated on Nucleosil C-18 and Vydac C-18 columns and on Mono S and polysulfoethyl-A columns using a variety of conditions for gradient elution (data not shown). With the exception of a few peaks, the elution profiles of the peptides obtained from plasminogen and cross-linked plasminogen were similar. Representative peptide profiles obtained on Nucleosil C-18 are shown in Fig. 2(A (plasminogen) and B (cross-linked plasminogen)). The heights of peaks P-1, P-2, and P-3 in Fig. 2A were markedly reduced in the peptide profile obtained from cross-linked plasminogen. In Fig. 2B, the corresponding peaks are X-1, X-2, and X-3. Furthermore, a single peak (X-33) seen in the profile obtained from cross-linked plasminogen had no counterpart in the profile obtained from monomeric plasminogen. Therefore, this peak was expected to represent two peptides cross-linked by an ∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysyl isopeptide bond. Peak X-33 was further purified by cation-exchange chromatography (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Purification of the material in peak X-33. Peak X-33, harboring an ∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysyl bond, was separated by cation-exchange chromatography. A polysulfoethyl-A column was eluted with a linear gradient of 5 mM H3PO4, 25% (v/v) acetonitrile (solvent A) and of 5 mM H3PO4, 25% (v/v) acetonitrile, 1 M NaCl (solvent B) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sequence analysis of the material in peaks P-1, P-2, and P-3 showed that each peak contained a main sequence, summarized in Table 1. A background of several minor peptides that could not be clearly identified was present in these peaks as well. As determined from the initial yields of PTH-derivatives, the levels of the minor peptides in peaks P-1, P-2, and P-3 were ~20% of that of each major sequence. As shown in Table 1, peak X-33 was found to consist of the stretches Thr-291-Arg-306 and Arg-312-Arg-324, cross-linked by an isopeptide bond involving Lys-298 and Gln-322. As expected, upon sequence analysis, the yields of the cross-linked mates were similar, and the cross-linking prevented tryptic cleavage at Lys-298. In the peptide profile from plasminogen peptides, residues 291-306 were recovered as the major peptides in peaks P-2 and P-1, while residues 312-324 were recovered as the major peptide in peak P-3.TABLE I Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 1, virtually all plasminogen had been cross-linked because only trace amounts of monomeric plasminogen were present. If peak X-33 represents the major site of cross-linking, peaks X-1, X-2, and X-3 would be expected to disappear nearly completely. This was evidently not the case (Fig. 2B), but upon sequence analysis of peaks X-1, X-2, and X-3, a set of NH2 termini similar to those representing the minor components in peaks P-1, P-2, and P-3 were revealed. In peaks X-1, X-2, and X-3, the major sequences of peaks P-1, P-2, and P-3 were recognized, respectively, but their levels were only ~20% of the average level of peptides present. Hence, we estimate that the pair Lys-298 and Gln-322 has been utilized in the cross-linking process to an extent of ~95%. Apart from the differences in the peptide profiles described above, it can be seen that the heights of several peaks with identical retention times in the separations shown in Fig. 2(A and B) are not the same. This could indicate different yields of certain noncross-linked peptides in the two digests or the presence of additional cross-linked peptides. To investigate this, we analyzed the peptide profiles of both monomeric and cross-linked plasminogens by dividing the eluates into 13 pools, as indicated in Fig. 2(A and B). Each of these pools was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac C-18 column using shallow gradients of acetonitrile. Differences between the profiles obtained from plasminogen and cross-linked plasminogen were observed only in the material from pools 2, 3, and 5 involving peaks P-1, P-2, P-3, X-1, X-2, X-3, and X-33 discussed above. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the relevant pools from Fig. 2B did not result in the appearance of bis-PTH-∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysine. Hence, the cross-link between Lys-298 and Gln-322 identified above is likely to be the only major cross-link in transglutaminase-polymerized plasminogen. Transglutaminase-catalyzed reactions result in the formation of isopeptide bonds between certain Gln residues (acyl donor sites) and Lys residues (acyl acceptor sites) in proteins. Potential acyl donor sites in proteins have generally been identified by transglutaminase-catalyzed incorporation of radioactive or fluorescent amines followed by characterization of the relevant peptide (see 30McDonagh R.P. McDonagh J. Petersen T.E. Thogersen H.C. Skorstensgaard K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. FEBS Lett. 1981; 127: 174-178Google Scholar, 1Aeschliemann D. Paulsson M. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11316-11321Google Scholar, and 11Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9007-9010Google Scholar). It has recently been possible to characterize potential acyl acceptor sites by incorporating specifically designed Gln-containing fluorescent peptides into proteins (24Lorand L. Parameswaran K.N. Velasco P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 82-83Google Scholar). However, the identification of ∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysyl cross-links in proteins is not straightforward, as documented by the variety of procedures employed (5Chen R. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 472-479Google Scholar; 7Cottrell B.A. Strong D.D. Watt K.W.K. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5405-5410Google Scholar; 18Kimura S. Aoki N. J. Biol.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 735-740Google Scholar; 47Sottrup-Jensen L. Hansen H.F. Pedersen H.S. Kristensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17727-17737Google Scholar; 16Hohl D. Mehrel T. Lichti U. Turner M.L. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6626-6636Google Scholar). Plasminogen is a substrate for transglutaminases (4Bendixen E. Borth W. Harpel P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21962-21967Google Scholar), and incubation of native plasminogen with guinea pig liver tissue transglutaminase results in the formation of a polymer of high molecular weight (Fig. 1). The content of ∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysine was estimated at 0.6-0.8 mol/mol of plasminogen, which, in view of the near absence of monomeric plasminogen after treatment with transglutaminase, is likely to reflect the introduction of only 1 mol of cross-link/mol of plasminogen. We investigated whether the cross-linking site(s) could be identified by comparison of the peptide profiles of tryptic digests of cross-linked and monomeric plasminogens. Trypsin appeared to degrade cross-linked and monomeric plasminogens equally well, suggesting that cross-linked plasminogen retains a rather open structure, and the majority of the peaks of the two profiles were easily paired (Fig. 2, A and B). Peptides were selected that were unique for cross-linked plasminogen and that appeared in reduced quantities in the profile of cross-linked plasminogen. As such, we found only one tryptic peptide that was unique for cross-linked plasminogen, namely peak X-33 (Fig. 2B). From sequence analysis of the pure cross-linked peptide (Fig. 3 and Table 1), in which the cross-link was identified as bis-PTH-∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysine, we conclude that Lys-298 and Gln-322 are cross-linked by an ∊-(γ-glutamyl)lysyl isopeptide bond. From the digest of monomeric plasminogen, we have characterized the corresponding noncross-linked peptides and found that these peptides are present in the digest of cross-linked plasminogen in very low amounts. Because the peptide separations have been performed under a variety of conditions and because only one cross-linked peptide was identified in cross-linked plasminogen, we conclude that Lys-298 and Gln-322, both located in the kringle 3 domain, constitute the acyl acceptor and acyl donor sites in the cross-linking process, respectively, and that these residues have been utilized to an extent of ~95%. It was found earlier (4Bendixen E. Borth W. Harpel P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21962-21967Google Scholar) that fluorescent substrates reacting with donor and acceptor sites become incorporated into plasminogen. The initial incorporation took place in monomeric plasminogen, but upon prolonged incubation, the substrates were also found in polymerized plasminogen. We believe that these substrates react with the donor and acceptor sites identified here and may become released from plasminogen in the polymerization process. However, there might be other reactive sites because incubation with dansylcadaverine did not block the polymerization process and the polymeric product did contain some fluorescent label (4Bendixen E. Borth W. Harpel P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21962-21967Google Scholar). The conformation of Glu-plasminogen has been described as a compact ellipsoid, coiled up in a spiral in which the NH2-terminal portion is in close proximity to the serine protease portion (3Banyai L. Patthy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6466-6471Google Scholar; 35Ponting C.P. Holland S.K. Cederholm-Williams S.A. Marshall J.M. Brown A.J. Spraggon G. Blake C.C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 155-161Google Scholar; 26Mangel W.F. Lin B. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 1990; 248: 69-73Google Scholar). According to this model, the kringle 3 domain protrudes from the compact plasminogen molecule. Our results substantiate this proposal by showing that part of the surface of kringle 3 is exposed for transglutaminase-mediated polymerization. Furthermore, the lack of oligomers (Fig. 1) (4Bendixen E. Borth W. Harpel P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21962-21967Google Scholar) in the cross-linking of plasminogen points to highly specific protein-protein interactions in the system. No high resolution structure is available for kringle 3, but to illustrate the putative location of Lys-298 and Gln-322, Fig. 4 shows a model of the homologous kringle 4 of plasminogen (32Mulichak A.M.

Clearly, both the donor and acceptor positions are located at the surface of the kringle, spaced apart by ~13 Å. Kringles 1, 4, and 5 mediate binding of human plasminogen to fibrin and cellular surfaces (49Thorsen S. Clemmensen I. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 668: 377-387Google Scholar; Lukas et al., 1983; 28Matsuka Y.V. Novokhatny V.V. Kudinov S.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 93-97Google Scholar; 52Wu H.L. Chang B.I. Wu D.H. Chang L.C. Gong C.C. Lou K.L. Shi G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19658-19664Google Scholar). The present finding that the cross-linking of plasminogen involves residues in kringle 3 is the first indication of a specific function for this domain. Lys-298 is conserved in plasminogen from all species sequenced so far (human (46Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Zajdel M. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Prog. Chem. Fibrinolysis Thrombolysis. 1978; 3: 191-209Google Scholar; 10Forsgren M.R.B. Israelson M. Larsson K. Heden L.-O. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 254-260Google Scholar), rhesus monkey (50Tomlinson J.E. McLean J.W. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5957-5965Google Scholar), mouse (9Degen S.J.F. Bell S.M. Schaefer L.A. Elliot R.W. Genomics. 1990; 8: 49-61Google Scholar), cattle (42Schaller J.

Fibrinolysis. 1987; 1: 91-102Google Scholar)). Gln-322 is conserved in human, rhesus monkey, and mouse plasminogen, being replaced by a Glu residue in plasminogen from cattle and pig. Therefore, plasminogen from rhesus monkey and mouse is a potential substrate for transglutaminases, but if plasminogen from cattle and pig is a substrate for transglutaminases, the acyl donor residue must be different from that of human plasminogen. Polymeric plasminogen cross-linked by transglutaminases maintains the characteristic behavior of 90-kDa plasminogen in the sense that it binds to endothelial cells and is readily activable by physiological plasminogen activators, and when activated, it shows full plasmin activity (4Bendixen E. Borth W. Harpel P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21962-21967Google Scholar). We suggest that cross-linked plasminogen is physiologically important on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. Besides being cross-linked to itself, plasminogen might become cross-linked to cell-surface and extracellular matrix proteins because the plasminogen polymers possess one free donor and acceptor site. The basement membrane proteins degraded by plasmin are also substrates for transglutaminases, and it is possible that plasminogen is cross-linked to some of these substrate proteins and thus is able to locally become activated when proteolysis of the extracellular matrix is required. Transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking of plasminogen may be a novel mechanism by which plasmin can interact with its specific target sites. These could include fibrin, fibrinogen, the extracellular matrix, cell-surface proteins, or circulating plasma proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2017979183,"To define the role of the N-terminal region of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) in its binding to insulin and IGF receptors, deletion mutants des-(1-5)-, des-(1-7)-, and des-(1-8)-recombinant (r) IGF-II, and the Gly8 for Leu substitution mutant of rIGF-II were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified. The binding affinity and mitogenic activity of these rIGF-II mutants as well as commercially available des-(1-6)-rIGF-II were analyzed. While the relative affinity of des-(1-5)- and des-(1-6)-rIGF-II for purified human insulin and IGF-I receptors remained at ≥50% levels of that of rIGF-II, the affinity of des-(1-7)-rIGF-II decreased to ~10% and ~3%, respectively, of that of rIGF-II. When the octapeptide including Leu8 was removed prior to the Cys9-Cys47 intrachain bond, the relative affinity of this deletion mutant, des-(1-8)-rIGF-II, for these receptors dramatically decreased to <1% of that of rIGF-II. Substituting Gly8 for Leu in rIGF-II decreased the affinity of this mutant for the IGF-I and insulin receptors to about the same extent. These results suggest that the side chains of Thr7 and Leu8 may play an important role in retaining all of the IGF-II functions. Decreases in the relative affinity for binding of the mutants to these receptors paralleled the decreases in their mitogenic potency for cultured Balb/c 3T3 cells. Although the relative affinity of des-(1-8)- or [Gly8]rIGF-II for rat IGF-II/CIM6-P (cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate) receptors was also <1% of that of rIGF-II, the relative affinities of des-(1-5)-, des-(1-6)-, and des-(1-7)-rIGF-II for these receptors was significantly greater than that of rIGF-II. These results clearly demonstrate that Thr7 and Leu8 are important for binding to insulin and IGF-I receptors and Leu8 is critical for expression of all IGF-II functions. To define the role of the N-terminal region of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) in its binding to insulin and IGF receptors, deletion mutants des-(1-5)-, des-(1-7)-, and des-(1-8)-recombinant (r) IGF-II, and the Gly8 for Leu substitution mutant of rIGF-II were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 445-462Google Scholar). On the basis of this homology, the structure of IGF-I and IGF-II has been divided into four domains designated B, C, A, and D beginning at the N terminus. The B- and A-domains of IGF-II like IGF-I and proinsulin are connected by three intrachain disulfide bonds between Cys9-Cys47, Cys21-Cys60, and Cys46-Cys51 that determine the proper folding and receptor binding specificities of the molecule(2Smith M.C.

IGF-II, unlike IGF-I and insulin, also binds with moderate to high affinity to the IGF-I and insulin receptors(4Casella S.J. Han V.K. D'Ercole A.J. Svoboda M.E. Van Wyk J.J. J. Biol.

Because of its high affinity receptor binding properties, our laboratories have undertaken to identify the residues that are critical for IGF-II binding to the insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors using site-directed mutagenic procedures. In our initial study, we observed that Tyr27, Phe26, and Val43 in the B- and A-domains were essential residues for IGF-II binding to the insulin and IGF-I receptors, whereas Phe48, Arg49, Ser50, Ala54, and Leu55 in the A-domain are residues that were required for its binding to IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors(6Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Google Scholar). Using these mutants, we showed evidence that IGF-II stimulated DNA synthesis in Balb/c 3T3 cells and glycogen synthesis in HepG2 cells via the IGF-I receptor(6Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Google Scholar). Finally in a more recent study, we established that residues Phe48, Arg49, and Ser50 were essential for the binding of IGF-II to IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) 1-6(7Bach L.A. Hsieh S. Sakano K. Fujiwara H. Perdue J.F. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9246-9254Google Scholar).The importance of the N-terminal pentapeptide of IGF-I for their functions has been reported(8Bagley C.J.

A naturally occurring truncated form of IGF-I, des-(1-3)-IGF-I, with enhanced mitogenic activity is present in human fetal and adult brain(9Sara V.R. Carlsson-Skwirut C. Andersson C. Hall E.

The increase in mitogenic potency was postulated to be the result of decreases in the affinity of des-(1-3)-rIGF-I for IGFBPs with the consequence that more unbound growth factor would be available to interact with IGF-I receptors(13Cascieri M.A. Hayes N.S. Bayne M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 181-188Google Scholar, 14Ross M. Francis G.L. Szabo L. Wallace J.C. Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 267-272Google Scholar). To date, the isolation of a naturally occurring truncated form of IGF-II has not been reported. However, several deletion mutants of the N-terminal sequence of rIGF-II have been prepared by recombinant procedures, i.e. des-(1-6)- and des-(1-8)-rIGF-II(15Lthi C. Roth B.V. Humbel R.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 483-490Google Scholar). It was shown that des-(1-6)-rIGF-II had approximately 10-fold reduced affinity for IGFBP-3 but retained an equal affinity for the IGF-I receptor, whereas the relative affinity of des-(1-8)-rIGF-II for IGF receptors and IGFBP-3 was ~20% of that of rIGF-II. Our preliminary observations with des-(1-8)-rIGF-II and [Gly8]rIGF-II indicated, however, that the relative affinity of both mutants for IGF and insulin receptors are <1% of that of rIGF-II(16Perdue J.F. Bach L.A. Hashimoto R. Sakano K. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Fujiwara H. Rechler M.M. Baxter R.C. Gluckman P.D. Rosenfeld R.G. The Insulin-like Growth Factors and Their Regulatory Proteins. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York1994: 67-76Google Scholar). The solution structure of rIGF-II that recently was determined by us (17Terasawa H. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Nagata K. Higashihashi N. Fujiwara H. Sakano K. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5590-5597Google Scholar) revealed that the N-terminal Ala1-Glu6 region is not well defined, i.e. the B-domain N terminus is flexible because it lacks distance constraints. In this study, we prepared a series of deletion mutants and a substitution mutant in the N-terminal first eight amino acids to more precisely define the contribution this region of the B-domain makes to the binding of rIGF-II to insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRestriction endonucleases and Klenow large fragment were purchased from Toyobo (Tokyo, Japan). Des-(1-6)-rIGF-II was purchased from Gropep Pty. Ltd. (Adelaide, Australia). 125I-human rIGF-I (2,000 Ci/mmol) and 125I-human rIGF-II (2,000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Co. (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) with the exception of 125I-human rIGF-II (2,000 Ci/mmol) that was used to measure the affinity of binding of IGF-II to bovine liver IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors (see below). This material was prepared by the Daiichi Radioisotope Laboratory (Tokyo, Japan). 125I-Human insulin (2,000 Ci/mmol) and [methyl-3H]thymidine (20 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. Pepsin was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available.Insulin and IGF-I receptors were purified to apparent homogeneity from Triton X-100-solubilized human placental membrane as described previously(18Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Choi S. Sakamoto Y. Itakura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5045-5049Google Scholar, 19LeBon T.R. Jacobs S. Cuatrecasas P. Kathuria S. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7685-7689Google Scholar). The IGF-II/CIM6-P receptor was partially purified from β-octyl glucoside-solubilized rat placenta as described previously(20Perdue J.F. Chan J.K. Thibault C. Radaj P. Mills B. Daughaday W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7800-7811Google Scholar). The IGF-II/CIM6-P receptor was purified from bovine liver according to the previously published procedure (21Sahagian G.G. Distler J.J. Jourdian G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 392-396Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, bovine liver acetone powder was prepared from fresh bovine liver. The acetone powder was solubilized with 2% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside, followed by wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, rIGF-II-coupled affinity resin, and [Leu27]rIGF-II2 2[Leu27]rIGF-II binds specifically to IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors but not to insulin and IGF-I receptors (6). -coupled affinity resin column chromatography. The purity of the IGF-II/CIM6-P receptor preparation was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining (data not shown).Oligonucleotides were synthesized by an Applied Biosystems model 380A synthesizer, purified as described previously(22Marumoto Y. Sato Y. Fujiwara H. Sakano K. Saeki Y. Agata M. Furusawa M. Maeda S. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 2599-2606Google Scholar), and sequences confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method(23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar).Construction of Mutant rIGF-II Genes for Expression in Escherichia coliThe recombinant human IGF-II gene that was used in this study was synthesized from the known sequence of human IGF-II cDNA as described previously(22Marumoto Y. Sato Y. Fujiwara H. Sakano K. Saeki Y. Agata M. Furusawa M. Maeda S. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 2599-2606Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid substitution or deletion mutants of rIGF-II were constructed by standard site-directed mutagenesis procedures using the synthetic oligonucleotides that are illustrated in Fig. 1. The substitution mutant [Gly8]rIGF-II was prepared based on the results of a study (24Nakagawa S.H. Tager H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11502-11509Google Scholar) that found that the mutant where LeuB6 was replaced by GlyB6 decreased its affinity to the insulin receptor markedly. In the preparation of the N-terminal deletion mutants, des-(1-5)-, des-(1-7)-, and des-(1-8)-rIGF-II, methionine was introduced at N-terminal residues 4, 6, or 7, so that their respective N termini can be removed by cleavage with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) during purification as described below.Expression, Preparation, and Chemical Characterization of Recombinant IGF-II MutantsrIGF-II mutants were expressed in E. coli MC1061 as fusion proteins with rat interleukin-1 (6Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Google Scholar). Purified preparations of these fusion proteins were cleaved by CNBr treatment. The IGF-II mutant proteins were refolded, intrachain disulfide bonds formed, and the native molecules were purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (rp-HPLC) as described previously(6Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Google Scholar).Proper folding of the purified rIGF-II mutants except for [Gly8]rIGF-II was determined by a previously described peptide mapping procedures that involved pepsin digestion, rp-HPLC, and amino acid composition analysis and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the isolated peptide fragments(2Smith M.C. Cook J.A. Furman T.C. Occolowitz J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9314-9321Google Scholar, 3Iwai, M Kobayashi, M. Tamura K. Ishii Y. Yamada H. Niwa M. J. Biochem.

Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Google Scholar). [Gly8]rIGF-II could not be characterized in the same way because the amino acid, i.e. Leu8, which is usually cleaved by pepsin becomes more resistant. Therefore, peptides corresponding to those generated when [Gly8]rIGF-II was digested were synthesized by an ABI model 431A peptide synthesizer using the selective S-S formation procedures(24Nakagawa S.H. Tager H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11502-11509Google Scholar). These were then compared with those obtained when [Gly8]rIGF-II was digested for their retention time during analytical rp-HPLC (data not shown).NMR MeasurementsWild type rIGF-II and [Gly8]rIGF-II at concentrations of 2.4 mM in 85% H2O, 10% D2O, 5% CD3CO2D, and des-(1-7)- and des-(1-8)-rIGF-II at 0.6 mM in the same solvent were adjusted to a pH of 2.6, and their 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a UNITY plus 600 spectrometer operating at 1H 600 MHz and 50°C with a spectral width of 7,000 Hz. Chemical shifts were referenced relative to the internal standard 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate.Characterization of Binding of rIGF-II Mutants to Insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II/CIM6-P ReceptorsCompetition for the binding of 125I-insulin and 125I-IGF-I to insulin and IGF-I receptors by insulin, IGF-I, rIGF-II, and rIGF-II mutants was carried out using human placental receptors that were purified as described previously(18Fujita-Yamaguchi Y.

Chem. 1986; 261: 7685-7689Google Scholar). Briefly, duplicate aliquots of 12-32 fmol of receptor were incubated at 4°C in 0.3 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.075% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20,000 cpm of 125I-insulin or 125I-IGF-I, and competing ligands at concentrations of 0.04-1.106 nM. Following an overnight incubation at 4°C, ligand-receptor complexes were precipitated by the addition of 0.1 ml of 0.4% (w/v) γ-globulin and 0.5 ml of 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol. Pellets were washed once and counted in a Pharmacia model 1272 Clini Gamma Counter.The affinities of the mutants for IGF-II/CIM6-P receptor were measured by using partially purified rat placental membrane-derived receptors prepared as described previously(20Perdue J.F. Chan J.K. Thibault C. Radaj P. Mills B. Daughaday W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7800-7811Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.0-1.5 μg of partially purified receptor preparations were incubated in a final volume of 0.4 ml of 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 0.5% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 20,000 cpm of 125I-IGF-II, and competing ligands at concentrations of 0.0075-200 nM. The affinities of the mutants for this receptor were also measured using purified bovine liver IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors. Purified bovine receptors (0.15 μg) were incubated in a final volume of 0.3 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.2% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 20,000 cpm of 125I-IGF-II, and competing ligands at concentrations of 0.004-32 nM. Receptor-ligand complexes were separated from unbound ligands by the polyethylene glycol procedure. Pellets were washed once and counted.The data from two to four experiments were plotted as the B/Bo where B is the quantity of 125I-labeled ligand bound in the presence of a given concentration of competing ligand, and Bo is the quantity of 125I-labeled ligand bound in the absence of unlabeled ligand. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants, Kd(app), for the binding of these ligands to the receptors were determined from the nanomoler concentrations of ligand that displaced 50% of specifically bound ligand.Characterization of the Biological Activities of rIGF-II MutantsThe biological activities of rIGF-II mutants were measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA as described previously(6Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Google Scholar, 25Saito Y. Yamada H. Niwa M. Ueda I. J.

In brief, subconfluent cultures of Balb/c 3T3 cells that were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum were plated in 96-well microtiter plates (collagen-coated cell wells; Corning) at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. rIGF-II or rIGF-II mutants at concentrations designated in Fig. 5 were added to the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h at 37°C. At the end of this incubation, the cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 h with 0.5 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine and unincorporated radioactivity removed by washing. The magnitude of [3H]thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA was quantified by liquid scintillation counting.Figure 5:Stimulation of DNA synthesis in Balb/c 3T3 cells by rIGF-II and the five rIGF-II mutants. •, rIGF-II; □, [Gly8]rIGF-II; ▴, des-(1-5)-rIGF-II; ▪, des-(1-6)-rIGF-II; ○, des-(1-7)-rIGF-II; and ∆, des-(1-8)-rIGF-II.

The position of the three intrachain disulfide bonds between Cys9 and Cys47, Cys21 and Cys60, and Cys46 and Cys51 in the three deletion mutants were confirmed by peptide mapping procedures and the [Gly8]rIGF-II mutant was found to be properly folded. The N-terminal amino acids for des-(1-5)-, des-(1-7)-, and des-(1-8)-rIGF-II were determined by protein sequencing to be Glu6, Leu8, and Cys9, respectively. The composition of the three disulfide bonds and mutation sites of these mutants are illustrated in Fig. 2. One-dimensional NMR spectra of des-(1-7)-, des-(1-8)-, and [Gly8]rIGF-II mutants were compared together with that of the wild type rIGF-II in Fig. 3. The spectra were similar with each other, supporting that three-dimensional structure of the mutants were not significantly different from that of the wild type rIGF-II.Figure 2:Schematic illustration of human IGF-II and the substitutions introduced into the five rIGF-II mutants.

Amide and aromatic proton regions of 600 MHz 1H NMR spectra of rIGF-II (A), des-(1-7)-rIGF-II (B), des-(1-8) rIGF-II (C), and [Gly8]rIGF-II (D) were measured in 85% H2O, 10% D2O, 5% CD3CO2D at 50°C as described under “Experimental Procedures”.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Relative Affinity of rIGF-II Mutants for Binding to Insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II/CIM6-P ReceptorsThe Kd(app) values for the binding of insulin and rIGF-II to human placental membrane insulin receptors were 0.12 and 0.9 nM, respectively (Fig. 4A). The Kd(app) values for the binding of rIGF-I and rIGF-II to human IGF-I receptors were 0.12 and 0.33 nM, respectively (Fig. 4B). These values are similar to those observed in an earlier study (6Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Google Scholar) for these ligands. The Kd(app) of 0.1-0.4 nM that was calculated for rIGF-II binding to the rat placental IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors (Fig. 4C) is 3-10 times higher than was observed in our initial study in which the Kd(app) was 0.04 nM(6Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Google Scholar). This difference probably reflects the use of two to three times more of the partially purified receptors than was used previously in order to obtain the same percent of binding. A relative affinity of binding of each mutant to the three receptors was calculated from their displacement curves shown in Fig. 4 and compared with that of rIGF-II, which was set to 100% (Table 1).Figure 4:Characterization of the binding of rIGF-II mutants to insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors. Competitive inhibition of 125I-human IGF-II binding to purified human placental insulin receptors (A), purified human placental IGF-I receptors (B), and partially purified rat placental IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors (C) by insulin (⊡), IGF-I (∇), rIGF-II (•), [Gly8]rIGF-II (□), des-(1-5)-rIGF-II (▴), des-(1-6)-rIGF-II (▪), des-(1-7)-rIGF-II (○); and des-(1-8)-rIGF-II (∆). The results are the mean of two to four experiments and are plotted as B/Bo, where B is the quantity of 125-labeled ligand bound in the presence of a given concentration of competing ligand and Bo is the quantity of 125I-labeled ligand bound in its absence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TABLE I Open table in a new tab The deletion of the first five, then six, and finally seven amino acids from the N-terminal end of the B-domain caused, with one exception, i.e. the IGF-I receptor data of des-(1-6)-rIGF-II, a progressive decrease in the relative affinity of the rIGF-II mutants for the insulin and IGF-I receptors (Fig. 4, A and B). With seven amino acids removed, des-(1-7)-rIGF-II bound to the insulin and IGF-I receptors with 11 and 3.3%, respectively, of the affinity of rIGF-II (Table 1). In sharp contrast, the sequential deletion, i.e. residues 5 to 7, had the opposite effect on the binding of the IGF-II mutants to the IGF-II/CIM6-P receptor. For example, the relative affinities of des-(1-5)-, des-(1-6)-, and des-(1-7)-rIGF-II for the rat placental membrane IGF-II/CIM6-P receptor were 350, 700, and 1,200% of that of rIGF-II. This unexpected result prompted us to examine the effect of N-terminal amino acid deletions of IGF-II on its binding to bovine liver IGF receptors. In this study, the Kd(app) for the binding of rIGF-II to bovine liver IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors was 0.06 nM. This Kd(app) value was lower than that of the rat placental IGF-II/CIM6-P receptor preparation used in the current study but was similar to the value obtained in the previous study(6Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Google Scholar). The affinities of des-(1-5)- and des-(1-7)-rIGF-II for the bovine receptors were 300 and 200%, respectively, of that of rIGF-II (Table 1). The affinity of the latter for the bovine receptor was much less than it was for the rat placental IGF-II/CIM6-P receptor, i.e. for 1,200%. However, the affinity of des-(1-5)-rIGF-II was about the same for both sources of IGF-II/CIM6-P receptor. Thus, the results of binding of the IGF-II mutants to both rat placental and bovine liver IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors indicated that deletion of the first seven N-terminal amino acids increased the affinity of the IGF-II mutants for the IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors.The greatest adverse effect on the binding of the rIGF-II to all three receptors occurred when Gly was substituted for Leu8 or the N-terminal sequence was deleted to Cys9. The binding of [Gly8]rIGF-II and des-(1-8)-rIGF-II was <2.0% of that of rIGF-II. In these analyses, [Gly8]rIGF-II tended to have relatively higher affinities for all three receptors when compared with des-(1-8)-rIGF-II. The effect of a single amino acid removal from IGF-II on its ability to bind to the IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors was clearly evident when deleting Leu8 from des-(1-7)-rIGF-II decreased the binding affinity of the new mutant by 3 logs. Finally, this result could not be due to drastically altered three-dimensional structure of the mutants, since the overall structure and proper disulfide bond formation of [Gly8]rIGF-II or des-(1-8)-rIGF-II have been confirmed by one-dimensional NMR and peptide mapping analysis, respectively.Characterization of the Biological Activities of rIGF-II Mutants[3H]Thymidine incorporation into the DNA of Balb/c 3T3 cells was used in our previous study to show that the amino acids Phe26, Tyr27, and Val43 that are required for the binding of IGF-II to IGF-I receptors were also required for the stimulation of DNA synthesis(6Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Google Scholar). Using the same approach, the magnitude of incorporation of [3H]thymidine into Balb/c 3T3 cells treated with varying concentrations of the N-terminal amino acid deletion mutants of rIGF-II decreased as the number of the amino acids deleted increased. For example, des-(1-5)-rIGF-II was equipotent with rIGF-II and des-(1-6)- and des-(1-7)-rIGF-II were proportionally less potent (Fig. 5). Des-(1-8)- and [Gly8]rIGF-II at concentrations of 200 nM, that produced a near-maximum response with rIGF-II, were 10-fold less potent as stimulators of DNA synthesis. Among the three receptors tested (Table 1), the relationship between mitogenic potency and N-terminal amino acid length to Thr7 of the deletion mutants was correlated the best with their ability to bind to IGF-I receptors.DISCUSSIONIn our previous studies with rIGF-II mutants, it was established that Phe26, Tyr27, and Val43 were essential for IGF-II binding to insulin and IGF-I receptors and that Phe48, Arg49, Ser50, Ala54, and Leu55 were essential for its interaction with IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors(6Sakano K.

Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Google Scholar). G proteins are activated by GTP, which upon binding to the α subunit (Gα), causes a conformational change (2Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Google Scholar, 3Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

GTP hydrolysis and GTP-GDP exchange, reactions critical for regulation of Gα activity, are dependent on the presence of receptor, Gβγ, and effector(4Navon S.E. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol.

Domains of Gα involved in interaction with receptor and Gβγ have been mapped using a variety of methods. It was concluded that the amino-terminal region of Gtα is important for its interaction with Gβγ. Removal of the first 18 amino acids from the amino terminus of Gtα by trypsin abolished Gtβγ stimulation of pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, although the ADP-ribosylation site itself was intact(8Watkins P.A. Burns D.L. Kanaho Y. Liu T.-Y. Hewlett E.L. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13478-13482Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis with staphylococcal V8 protease, which removes 21 amino acids from the amino terminus, inhibited other ββγ-dependent reactions including receptor-stimulated GTP hydrolysis, GTP-GDP exchange, and binding of Gtα to rhodopsin(4Navon S.E. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15746-15751Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody directed against the amino terminus of Gtα interfered with pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation(9Justice J. Bliziotes M.M. Stevens L.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6436-6439Google Scholar), as did deletions in the amino terminus of recombinant Giα3(10Graf R. Mattera R. Codina J. Estes M.R. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24307-24314Google Scholar). Amino acids 7-10 in recombinant Goα were deemed critical for interaction with Gtβγ(11Denkar B.M. Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6272-6277Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of Gα subunits is important for receptor interaction. ADP-ribosylation of cysteine 347, four residues from the carboxyl-terminal end of Gtα, functionally uncoupled it from receptor(12West Jr., R.E. Moss J. Vaughan M. Liu T. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14428-14430Google Scholar, 13Hsia J.A. Moss J. Hewlett E.L. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1086-1090Google Scholar, 14Kurose H. Katada T. Amano T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4870-4874Google Scholar). Peptides possessing the carboxyl-terminal sequence of Gtα inhibited its binding to rhodopsin(15Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave H.A. Koenig B. Hoffman K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Google Scholar). The behavior of chimeric Giα/Gsα recombinant proteins was consistent with the conclusion that the carboxyl terminus of Gsα is critical for coupling the β-adrenergic receptor to adenylyl cyclase (16Masters S.B. Sullivan K.A. Miller R.T. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Ramachandran J. Bourne H.R. Science. 1988; 241: 448-451Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus is important in the membrane association of Gsα(17Journot L. Pantaloni C. Poul M.-A. Mazarguil H. Bockaert J. Audigier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10054-10058Google Scholar, 18Audigier Y. Journot L. Pantaloni C. Bckaert J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1427-1435Google Scholar), and the carboxyl terminus of Gtα was postulated to be involved in anchoring the Gtα•phosphodiesterase complex to membranes(19Catty P. Pfister C. Bruckert F. Deterre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19489-19493Google Scholar). G proteins appear to interact with the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Association of Gtβγ with membranes is facilitated by farnesylation or geranylgeranylation of a cysteine four amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the βγ subunit(20Fukada Y. Takao T. Ohguro H. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1990; 346: 658-660Google Scholar, 21Lai R.K. Perez-Sala D. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Membrane association of some Gα subunits (e.g. Goα and Giα) was dependent on the amino terminus as limited digestion with trypsin, which removes an amino-terminal 2-kDa fragment, produced a soluble protein(24Eide B. Gierschick P. Milligan G. Mullaney I. Unson C. Goldsmith P. Spiegel A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1398-1405Google Scholar). The amino-terminal glycines of Goα and Giα are myristoylated, a modification that enhances membrane association (25Mumby S.M. Heukeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Google Scholar, 26Buss J.E. Mumby S.M. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. Sefton B.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 84: 7493-7497Google Scholar, 27Jones T.L.Z. Simonds W.F. Merendine J.J. Brann M.R.

Commun. 1987; 146: 1234-1239Google Scholar). Membrane association may occur directly via the myristoyl moiety and its neighboring amino acids, as has been postulated for the Src protein(29Pellman D. Garber E.A. Cross F.R. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1985; 314: 374-377Google Scholar, 30Krueger J.G. Garber E.A. Goldberg A.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1983; 107: 52-127Google Scholar), or indirectly if it increases the association of the α subunit with the prenylated and membrane-associated Gβγ subunits(31Linder M.E. Pang I.-H. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4654-4659Google Scholar, 32Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 631-637Google Scholar). In support of the latter hypothesis, both ββγ-stimulated ADP-ribosylation and the affinity of Goα for ββγ-Sepharose were significantly greater with the myristoylated than with the nonmyristoylated protein(11Denkar B.M. Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6272-6277Google Scholar, 31Linder M.E. Pang I.-H. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4654-4659Google Scholar). Goα modified with more hydrophilic myristate analogues was less likely than native Goα to associate with membranes(25Mumby S.M. Heukeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Google Scholar). In sum, the data are consistent with a role for a myristoylated amino terminus in membrane association, although with the more recent recognition that several Gα subunits are also palmitoylated, the contribution of the less hydrophobic myristate may need to be reassessed(33Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2800-2804Google Scholar). Integral membrane proteins have been identified and purified based on their phase-partitioning characteristics(34Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Google Scholar). Solutions of Triton X-114 separate into detergent-rich and detergent-depleted (aqueous) phases at ≈30°C. It is generally agreed upon that the more “hydrophobic” a protein or peptide, the more likely it will partition into the detergent-rich phase. This partitioning difference has been the basis for separating integral from peripheral membrane proteins(34Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Google Scholar). We investigated this partitioning procedure as a new way of characterizing the hydrophobic and membrane-association domains of native and recombinant Gtα and myristoylated and nonmyristoylated rGoα as well as possibly assessing protein-protein interactions in a purified defined system.

Densitometry was performed with a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer and Image Quant software. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were done in a Novex Minicell apparatus using 12% or 4-20% gradient Tris/glycine gels. PDE was essentially prepared as described previously(35Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11669-11677Google Scholar, 36Hurley J.B. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11094-11099Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh bovine eyes were obtained from a local abattoir; retinas were dissected, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −70°C. After thawing, retinas were suspended in buffer A (60 mM KCl, 30 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mM NaN3, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA) containing 45% sucrose, vortexed, and centrifuged (27,750 × g, 20 min). After diluting the supernatant with an equal volume of buffer A without sucrose, rod outer segments (ROS) were pelleted by centrifugation (27,750 × g, 20 min). Pellets were washed twice by suspending in buffer A and centrifuging (27,750 × g, 20 min). Washed ROS were then suspended in buffer B (5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM NaN3, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged (45,000 × g, 30 min). This supernatant, which contained mainly PDE (35Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11669-11677Google Scholar) and arrestin, was concentrated in a Macrosep 100 concentrator (Filtron Technology Corp.) and used as such or further purified by molecular sizing on an Ultrogel AcA-34 column. ROS, after extraction of PDE, were washed three additional times by centrifugation in buffer B without soybean trypsin inhibitor or leupeptin (45,000 × g, 30 min). Transducin was then eluted with buffer B containing 100 μM GTP with centrifugation (45,000 × g, 30 min). Gtα and Gtβγ subunits were resolved by blue Sepharose chromatography(39Shinozawa T. Uchida S. Martin E. Cafiso D. Hubbell W. Bitensky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1408-1411Google Scholar). To prepare Gtα with radiolabeled GDP or GTP, PDE-depleted ROS were washed three times in buffer A, and Gtα was eluted by two extractions with buffer A containing 50 μM [35S]GTPβγS (2-5 mCi/mmol) or 100 μM [3H]GTP (4-10 mCi/mmol)(38Khn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Google Scholar). Gtα was concentrated with a Centriprep-10 (Amicon, Inc.), and free nucleotide was removed using PD-10 columns. Samples were stored at 4°C and used within 3 days. Bound nucleotide was identified by heating Gtα at 95°C and analyzing the released nucleotide on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates developed with 1.6 M LiCl(40Randerath K. Randerath E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 12: 323-347Google Scholar), which verified that Gtα eluted with [35S]GTPβγS retained this nucleotide. [3H]GTP bound to Gtα was, however, hydrolyzed to [3H]GDP. To obtain Gtαβγ in GDP-bound (Gtαβγ•GDP) and GTPβγS-bound (Gtαβγ•GTPβγS) states, procedures were identical except that hypotonic conditions were used for elution with labeled nucleotide(38Khn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Google Scholar). Rhodopsin was prepared by the method of Hong and Hubbell(41Hong K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4517-4523Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie Blue assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. PDE activity was assayed for 10 min at 30°C in 0.3 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 8.3 mM MgCl2, 1 μM [3H]cGMP (~20,000 cpm/assay). Reactions were terminated by addition of 100 μl of 11.25 mM cGMP and 5 mM 5′-GMP in 250 mM HCl; neutralized with 100 μl of 250 mM NaOH in 250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; and then incubated with 5′-nucleotidase (Crotalus atrox venom) at 30°C for 20 min. The 3H-labeled nucleoside produced was collected for radioassay(42Yamamoto T. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12526-12533Google Scholar). In a modification of the method of Bordier(34Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Google Scholar), Triton X-114 was added (final concentration of 1%) to protein samples in buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM NaN3, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 150 mM NaCl) in a final volume of 40-75 μl. Mixtures were gently mixed and kept on ice for 3-5 min. After warming to 37°C for 5 min, the cloudy solution was centrifuged (300 × g, 5 min) in a swinging bucket rotor prewarmed to 30-37°C. The upper aqueous layer was aspirated. Buffer C was added to the detergent phase, which contained no visible particulates, and Triton X-114 was added to the aqueous phase to equalize the compositions and volumes of the two fractions. Equal volumes of each phase were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and quantified by densitometry. In experiments in which Gtα contained radiolabeled nucleotide, samples of the two phases were subjected to PD-10 column chromatography to separate unbound from protein-bound nucleotide, which was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Nucleotide that became unbound during partitioning accumulated primarily (>85%) in the aqueous phase. Transducin (Gtαβγ; 0.5 mg/ml), Gtα (0.2 mg/ml), or PDE (1 mg/ml) in hypotonic buffer was incubated with TPCK-treated trypsin (1.2 μg/ml) at 30°C for 2-10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or soybean trypsin inhibitor (final concentrations of 1 mM and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively). DNA inserts for Gtα and a carboxyl-truncated form of Gtα were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using Gtα1 cDNA as template. The 5′-primer for both transducin molecules was 5′-GCAGCAGCATGATCAGGGGCCAGCGCTGAGGAGAAG-3′, which includes a BclI restriction site enabling excision of the polymerase chain reaction product with BclI and cloning into the BamHI site of the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) without cleaving the BamHI site within the Gtα1 coding sequence. The 3′-primers (5′-GCGCCACGGGAATTCTCAGAAGAGCCCGCAGTCTT-3′ and 5′-GCGCCAGCGGAATTCTCAAAACTTGACGTTCTGCGTGTC-3′) included an EcoRI site after the natural stop codon or after a stop codon introduced to replace codon 331 (valine) to yield a truncated protein. Following polymerase chain reaction, Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer) and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a QIAGEN polymerase chain reaction purification kit. Products were digested with BclI and EcoRI. Gtα inserts were gel-purified with Qiaex resin (QIAGEN) and ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI-restricted pGEX-2T vector using T4 DNA ligase. Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) were transformed using heat shock and selected on ampicillin-containing LB agar plates. After isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction, positive clones were screened for protein production using SDS-PAGE. For large-scale purification of fusion proteins, E. coli cells were grown in 500-1000 ml of LB/ampicillin medium at 37°C to an absorbance of 0.4 at 600 nm. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added (final concentration of 100 μM), and incubation (with shaking) was continued for 3-4 h. After centrifugation, cell pellets were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed using nitrogen cavitation. Sarcosine (0.5%) was added to solubilize the fusion proteins, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 4°C, 10 min). Triton X-100 (final concentration of 1%) and glutathione-agarose beads were added to the supernatant, and the mixture was rocked for 2-3 h at 4°C. Binding of fusion protein to the beads in the presence of sarcosine required Triton X-100. Bound fusion protein (0.25-1.0 mg) was eluted with 3-5 ml of 10 mM reduced glutathione, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100 and cleaved with thrombin (2-4 μg/ml). Intact Gtα was quantified by immunoblot using AS/7, a polyclonal antipeptide antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of Gtα(43Cerione R.A. Kroll S. Rajaram R. Unson C. Goldsmith P. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9345-9352Google Scholar). GA/1, an amino terminus-directed G protein-specific polyclonal antibody, reacted similarly with intact and carboxyl-truncated forms of recombinant Gtα. Intact Gtα was ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin; as expected, the truncated form, which lacks the ADP-ribose acceptor site (Cys-347), was not. The coding region of bovine Goα cDNA was inserted into the pT7/Nde expression vector(44Hong J.-X. Haun R.S. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9743-9745Google Scholar). This was transfected into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), which had or had not been previously transfected with the pACYC177/ET3d/yNMT vector(45Haun R.S. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7064-7068Google Scholar). Bacteria cotransfected with both plasmids overexpressed the yeast N-myristoyltransferase and Goα, with the resultant production of myristoylated rGoα(46Duronio R.J. Jackson-Mchelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Google Scholar), whereas those transfected only with pT7/Nde containing Goα sequence overexpressed nonmyristoylated rGoα. An overnight culture (0.2 ml) of the cotransfected bacteria was added to 2 ml of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics, grown at 37°C for 1 h, and induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside in the presence of [3H]myristic acid (100 μCi, 16 Ci/mmol). Growth was continued for an additional 3 h before centrifugation (15,000 × g, 7 min). Cells were then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; lysed by sonification; and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 45 min). The supernatant, which contained crude 3H-labeled myristoylated rGoα, was used in phase-partitioning experiments. The same procedure was used for the singly transfected cells, which produced nonmyristoylated rGoα. Following partitioning, proteins were detected by autoradiography in experiments using 3H-labeled myristoylated rGoα and with an anti-Goα antibody (47Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Kanaho Y. Halpern J.L. Moss J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4728-4737Google Scholar) after blotting to nitrocellulose for both 3H-labeled myristoylated rGoα and nonmyristoylated rGoα. Gtα (1 μg) with or without the indicated amounts of Gtβγ was incubated at 30°C for 20 min (total volume of 50 μl), in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mM thymidine, 10 μM [32P]NAD (1 μCi/assay), 40 μM ATP with 0.1 μg of pertussis toxin-activated with 20 mM dithiothreitol immediately before use(13Hsia J.A. Moss J. Hewlett E.L. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1086-1090Google Scholar). [32P]ADP-ribosylated proteins were subjected to Triton X-114 phase partitioning, separated by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to Kodak XAR film at −70°C for 1-4 h. Gtα (45 μg) was incubated at 30°C for 45 min with or without the NAD:arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase (4.5 μg), which had been purified from turkey erythrocytes (48Moss J. Stanley S.J. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5838-5840Google Scholar) in 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mM KPO4, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 100 μM NAD (10-15 μCi). Following labeling, samples were applied to NAP-5 columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to separate protein-bound from unbound radioactivity (enabling an estimation of extent of labeling) before use in phase-partitioning experiments. Arrestin, a soluble 48-kDa protein that copurified with Gt, remained primarily in the detergent-depleted phase (Fig. 1A and Table 1), whereas Gtβγ (which contains farnesylated Gtγ) and PDE (the β subunit of which is prenylated) (49Anant J.S. Ong O.C. Xie H. Clarke S. O'Brien P.J. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 687-690Google Scholar) were found mainly in the detergent-rich phase (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Rhodopsin, an integral membrane protein, partitioned, as expected, almost exclusively into the detergent-rich phase (Fig. 1B and Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Gtα, in the absence of Gtβγ, partitioned about equally between the detergent-rich and detergent-depleted phases (Fig. 1A and Table 1). On repeated partitioning of Gtβγ from either the aqueous or detergent phase, distribution between detergent and aqueous phases was similar regardless of the phase from which Gtα originated (data not shown). In the presence of Gtβγ, Gtα was recovered to a greater extent in the detergent-rich phase. Recovery of Gtα in the detergent-rich phase increased with increasing amounts of Gtβγ (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, Gtα appeared not to affect the partitioning of Gtβγ (Table 1). After addition of Gpp(NH)p in the presence of Gtβγ and rhodopsin, Gtα was recovered to a greater extent in the aqueous phase presumably as a result of dissociation of Gtα•Gpp(NH)p from Gtβγ (Fig. 3). In the absence of rhodopsin, Gpp(NH)p had no effect on the partitioning of Gtα (data not shown). Rhodopsin, in the absence of Gtβγ, did not significantly influence the phase partitioning of Gtα (data not shown), consistent with other evidence that Gtβγ is important for functional association of Gtα and receptor(5Phillips W.J. Wong S.C. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17040-17046Google Scholar). To evaluate directly the role of bound nucleotide in apparent hydrophobicity, samples of Gtα•GDP, Gtα•GTPβγS, Gtαβγ•GDP, and Gtαβγ•GTPβγS underwent phase partitioning. PD-10 columns were used to separate protein-bound from unbound nucleotide. Ratios of protein-bound nucleotide in aqueous and detergent phases concurred with ratios of total protein on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels quantified by densitometry (Table 2), indicating that the total protein reflected the fraction containing bound nucleotide, i.e. Gtα retained nucleotide during partitioning. Whether GTPβγS or GDP was bound made no difference to the overall hydrophobicity of Gtα in the absence of Gtβγ (Fig. 4A and Table 2). In the presence of Gtβγ, however, Gtα•GDP was recovered to a much greater extent in the detergent phase, likely as a result of its tight association with the more hydrophobic Gtβγ complex containing the farnesylated βγ subunit. In contrast, Gtα•GTPβγS partitioning was independent of Gtβγ (Fig. 4B and Table 2).TABLE II Open table in a new tab Interaction between the PDE complex and Gtα•GTPβγS was studied by partitioning the proteins separately and together, which yielded similar results whether the amounts of Gtα and PDE were equimolar or one or the other was in excess (data not shown). To verify that the proteins were not denatured during partitioning, PDE activity and Gtα•GTPβγS-activated PDE activity were determined. The distribution of PDE activity in detergent and aqueous phases was similar whether or not Gtα•GTPβγS was present during partitioning (Fig. 5) and also when PDE partitioned in the absence of Gtα•GTPβγS was assayed in its presence (data not shown). The partitioning of Gtα•GTPβγS was not affected by PDE whether measured by SDS-PAGE and densitometry or by quantifying protein-bound radioactive nucleotide (data not shown). To define better the structural domains responsible for partitioning, Gtα, Gtβγ, and Gtαβγ were subjected to limited proteolysis with trypsin. Cleavage products of Gtβγ were recovered in the detergent-rich phase to a greater extent than were those from Gtα (Fig. 6). In the presence of Gtβγ, the fraction of intact 39-kDa Gtα recovered in that phase was greater than that of the 37-kDa fragment lacking the amino terminus (Fig. 6). Since the amino terminus of Gtα is involved in interaction with Gtβγ, it was unclear whether the difference in behavior of intact Gtα and the 37-kDa protein resulted from disruption of the Gtβγ-binding site with loss of ability of Gtα to associate with and be influenced by Gtβγ or whether the amino terminus itself contributed significantly to the hydrophobicity of Gtα. To evaluate this, Gtα was trypsinized without Gtβγ, and in some experiments, after stopping trypsinolysis with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or soybean trypsin inhibitor, intact Gtα was added back before partitioning to ensure that sufficient intact Gtα would be recovered for densitometric measurement. Even in the absence of Gtβγ, intact Gtα was recovered to a greater extent in the detergent-rich phase than was the 37-kDa fragment (and other major tryptic products), although amounts of both were less than when Gtβγ was present (Fig. 7; data not shown), consistent with the conclusion that the amino terminus is primarily responsible for the hydrophobic nature of Gtα and that this hydrophobicity is not a consequence solely of interaction with Gtβγ. After trypsinolysis, PDE accumulated mostly in the detergent-depleted phase (Table 1).Figure 7:Phase partitioning of tryptic fragments of Gtα.
