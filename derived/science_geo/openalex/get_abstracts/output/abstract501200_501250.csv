We retrospectively evaluated potential risk factors for cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity as well as the potential impact of intravenous magnesium supplementation on such toxicity. Patients and Methods We reviewed clinical data for 401 patients who underwent chemotherapy including a high dose (≥60 mg/m2) of cisplatin in the first-line setting. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in the serum creatinine concentration of at least grade 2 during the first course of cisplatin chemotherapy, as assessed on the basis of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The severity of nephrotoxicity was evaluated on the basis of the mean change in the serum creatinine level. Magnesium was administered intravenously to 67 patients (17%). Results Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity was observed in 127 patients (32%). Multivariable analysis revealed that an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 (risk ratio, 1.876; P = 0.004) and the regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (risk ratio, 1.357; P = 0.047) were significantly associated with an increased risk for cisplatin nephrotoxicity, whereas intravenous magnesium supplementation was associated with a significantly reduced risk for such toxicity (risk ratio, 0.175; P = 0.0004). The development of hypomagnesemia during cisplatin treatment was significantly associated with a greater increase in serum creatinine level (P = 0.0025). Magnesium supplementation therapy was also associated with a significantly reduced severity of renal toxicity (P = 0.012). Conclusions A relatively poor performance status and the regular use of NSAIDs were significantly associated with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, although the latter association was marginal. Our findings also suggest that the ability of magnesium supplementation to protect against the renal toxicity of cisplatin warrants further investigation in a prospective trial."
https://openalex.org/W2005566561,"REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ nuclear receptors regulate several physiological processes, including circadian rhythm and metabolism. A previous study reported the REV-ERBα gene to be co-overexpressed with ERBB2 in breast cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, we found that several tumor types, including a number of breast cancer cell lines, predominantly express the REV-ERBβ variant. This pattern was independent of ERBB2 and ER status, and opposite to that of non-cancer mammary epithelial HMEC cells, in which REV-ERBα was the major variant. Consistent with this molecular profile, REV-ERB target genes in both circadian and metabolic pathways were derepressed upon silencing of REV-ERBβ, but not REV-ERBα. Strikingly, we found that REV-ERBβ is a determinant of sensitivity to chloroquine, a clinically relevant lysosomotropic agent that suppresses autophagy. The cytoprotective function of REV-ERBβ appears to operate downstream of autophagy blockade. Through compound screening, we identified ARN5187, a novel lysosomotropic REV-ERBβ ligand with a dual inhibitory activity toward REV-ERB-mediated transcriptional regulation and autophagy. Remarkably, although ARN5187 and chloroquine share similar lysosomotropic potency and have a similar effect on autophagy inhibition, ARN5187 is significantly more cytotoxic. Collectively, our results reveal that dual inhibition of REV-ERBβ and autophagy is an effective strategy for eliciting cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Furthermore, our discovery of a novel inhibitor compound of both REV-ERB and autophagy may provide a scaffold for the discovery of new multifunctional anticancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W2026209030,"The presence of hypoxic regions in solid tumors is an adverse prognostic factor for patient outcome. Here, we show that hypoxia induces the expression of Ephrin-A3 through a novel hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated mechanism. In response to hypoxia, the coding EFNA3 mRNA levels remained relatively stable, but HIFs drove the expression of previously unknown long noncoding (lnc) RNAs from EFNA3 locus and these lncRNA caused Ephrin-A3 protein accumulation. Ephrins are cell surface proteins that regulate diverse biological processes by modulating cellular adhesion and repulsion. Mounting evidence implicates deregulated ephrin function in multiple aspects of tumor biology. We demonstrate that sustained expression of both Ephrin-A3 and novel EFNA3 lncRNAs increased the metastatic potential of human breast cancer cells, possibly by increasing the ability of tumor cells to extravasate from the blood vessels into surrounding tissue. In agreement, we found a strong correlation between high EFNA3 expression and shorter metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients. Taken together, our results suggest that hypoxia could contribute to metastatic spread of breast cancer via HIF-mediated induction of EFNA3 lncRNAs and subsequent Ephrin-A3 protein accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2094747616,"The Hippo signaling pathway regulates cellular proliferation and survival, thus exerting profound effects on normal cell fate and tumorigenesis. Pivotal effectors of this pathway are YAP/TAZ, transcriptional co-activators whose dysfunction contributes to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and malignant transformation. Therefore, it is of great importance to decipher the mechanisms underlying the regulations of YAP/TAZ at various levels. Here we report that non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase 14 (PTPN14) interacts with the Kibra protein. The interaction between PTPN14 and Kibra is through the PPXY domain of PTPN14 and WW domain of Kibra. PTPN14 and Kibra can induce the LATS1 activation independently and cooperatively. Interestingly, activation of LATS1 by PTPN14 is dependent on the C terminus of PTPN14 and independent of the upstream mammalian STE20-like kinase (MST) proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PTPN14 increases the LAST1 protein stability. Last, overexpression of Kibra rescues the increased cell migration and aberrant three-dimensional morphogenesis induced by knockdown of PTPN14, and this rescue is mediated through the activation of the upstream LATS1 kinase and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP. In summary, our results indicate a potential regulatory role of PTPN14 in the Hippo pathway and demonstrate another layer of regulation in the YAP oncogenic function."
https://openalex.org/W1992424565,"Oncogenic RAS promotes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which mediate pro-malignant signaling but can also trigger DNA damage-induced tumor suppression. Thus RAS-driven tumor cells require redox-protective mechanisms to mitigate the damaging aspects of ROS. Here, we show that MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1), the mammalian 8-oxodGTPase that sanitizes oxidative damage in the nucleotide pool, is important for maintaining several KRAS-driven pro-malignant traits in a nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) model. MTH1 suppression in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells impairs proliferation and xenograft tumor formation. Furthermore, MTH1 levels modulate KRAS-induced transformation of immortalized lung epithelial cells. MTH1 expression is upregulated by oncogenic KRAS and correlates positively with high KRAS levels in NSCLC human tumors. At a molecular level, in p53-competent KRAS-mutant cells, MTH1 loss provokes DNA damage and induction of oncogene-induced senescence. In p53-nonfunctional KRAS-mutant cells, MTH1 suppression does not produce DNA damage but reduces proliferation and leads to an adaptive decrease in KRAS expression levels. Thus, MTH1 not only enables evasion of oxidative DNA damage and its consequences, but can also function as a molecular rheostat for maintaining oncogene expression at optimal levels. Accordingly, our results indicate MTH1 is a novel and critical component of oncogenic KRAS-associated malignancy and its inhibition is likely to yield significant tumor-suppressive outcomes in KRAS-driven tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2012163392,"Outer membrane particles from Gram-negative bacteria are attractive vaccine candidates as they present surface antigens in their natural context. We previously developed a high yield production process for genetically derived particles, called generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA), from Shigella. As GMMA are derived from the outer membrane, they contain immunostimulatory components, especially lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We examined ways of reducing their reactogenicity by modifying lipid A, the endotoxic part of LPS, through deletion of late acyltransferase genes, msbB or htrB, in GMMA-producing Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri strains. GMMA with resulting penta-acylated lipid A from the msbB mutants showed a 600-fold reduced ability, and GMMA from the S. sonnei ΔhtrB mutant showed a 60,000-fold reduced ability compared with GMMA with wild-type lipid A to stimulate human Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in a reporter cell line. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, GMMA with penta-acylated lipid A showed a marked reduction in induction of inflammatory cytokines (S. sonnei ΔhtrB, 800-fold; ΔmsbB mutants, 300-fold). We found that the residual activity of these GMMA is largely due to non-lipid A-related TLR2 activation. In contrast, in the S. flexneri ΔhtrB mutant, a compensatory lipid A palmitoleoylation resulted in GMMA with hexa-acylated lipid A with ∼10-fold higher activity to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells than GMMA with penta-acylated lipid A, mostly due to retained TLR4 activity. Thus, for use as vaccines, GMMA will likely require lipid A penta-acylation. The results identify the relative contributions of TLR4 and TLR2 activation by GMMA, which need to be taken into consideration for GMMA vaccine development.

Gram-negative bacteria naturally shed particles that consist of outer membrane lipids, outer membrane proteins, and soluble periplasmic components. These particles, called native outer membrane vesicles, have been proposed for use as vaccines (1.Ellis T.N. Kuehn M.J. Virulence and immunomodulatory roles of bacterial outer membrane vesicles.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). However, the yield is usually too low for a practical vaccine production. We have developed genetic modification of bacteria to induce high level shedding of particles called generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA) 2The abbreviations used are: GMMAgeneralized modules for membrane antigenPBMCperipheral blood mononuclear cellTLRToll-like receptorKDO2-keto-3-deoxyoctonateOAgO antigen.

In the case of Shigella, the required genetic modification is a deletion of the tolR gene whose corresponding protein is involved with linking the inner and outer membranes. This development is part of a program to develop an effective and affordable vaccine for the causative agents of shigellosis, a global human health problem, especially in developing countries and in children younger than 5 years (4.Kotloff K.L.

Shigella are Gram-negative bacteria divided into 50 different serotypes based on the carbohydrate composition of the O antigen of their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (7.Liu B. Knirel Y.A. Feng L.

A limited number of serotypes contributes to the global burden of shigellosis, but the leading disease-causing serotypes vary between regions (8.Levine M.M. Kotloff K.L. Barry E.M. Pasetti M.F.

GMMA are highly immunogenic (2.Berlanda Scorza F. Colucci A.M. Maggiore L. Sanzone S. Rossi O. Ferlenghi I. Pesce I. Caboni M. Norais N. Di Cioccio V. Saul A. Gerke C. High yield production process for Shigella outer membrane particles.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e35616Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), in part, probably because of strong self-adjuvanticity. Because they are derived from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, they have high levels of LPS and lipoproteins, molecules that are strong activators of the innate immune response through recognition by different pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a widely expressed sets of molecules present in mammalian cells (11.Kawai T. Akira S. The role of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity: update on Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). The receptors of particular importance for recognition of Gram-negative bacteria are TLR2 and TLR4. TLR2 is involved in the recognition of a wide range of pathogen-associated molecular patterns that include lipoproteins (di- or tri-acetylated) (11.Kawai T. Akira S. The role of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity: update on Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). TLR4 is the receptor involved in the recognition of LPS with MD-2, CD14, and LPS-binding protein (11.Kawai T. Akira S. The role of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity: update on Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar, 12.Park B.S. Song D.H.

Depending on the dose of GMMA to be used in a vaccine, this strong activation of innate immunity may lead to unacceptable reactions in human subjects, e.g. a febrile response or, in extreme cases, septic shock (13.Opal S.M. The host response to endotoxin, antilipopolysaccharide strategies, and the management of severe sepsis.Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2007; 297: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), especially if parenterally administered. Further genetic manipulations of the bacteria could be used to reduce this risk. The single most abundant and highly potent immunostimulatory component in GMMA is LPS (1.Ellis T.N. Kuehn M.J. Virulence and immunomodulatory roles of bacterial outer membrane vesicles.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Its structure is amenable to genetic modification to reduce the activation of the TLR4 pathway. To assess the effect of such genetic modifications, it is important to determine the relative contribution of TLR2 and TLR4 pathways to the reactogenicity of GMMA. This needs to be tested in human cells or cell lines containing the human TLR recognition system because the cytokine response induced varies considerably between mammalian species. For example, penta-acylated lipid A is a poor inducer of cytokines from human cells but is a strong stimulator of mouse cells (14.Schromm A.B. Brandenburg K. Loppnow H. Moran A.P. Koch M.H. Rietschel E.T. Seydel U. Biological activities of lipopolysaccharides are determined by the shape of their lipid A portion.Eur. J.

Deuren Mv Neisseria meningitidis lipid A mutant LPSs function as LPS antagonists in humans by inhibiting TLR 4-dependent cytokine production.Innate Immun. 2011; 17: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). LPS consists of three main regions as follows: the glycolipid, lipid A, a core oligosaccharide, and an oligosaccharide chain (O antigen, OAg) usually consisting of 20–40 repeating units comprising 2–8 sugar molecules (16.Rietschel E.T. Kirikae T. Schade F.U. Mamat U. Schmidt G. Loppnow H. Ulmer A.J. Zähringer U. Seydel U. Di Padova F. Bacterial endotoxin: molecular relationships of structure to activity and function.FASEB J. 1994; 8: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Lipid A, which anchors the LPS to the outer membrane of bacteria, is the endotoxic part of LPS. The most endotoxic form of lipid A consists of a hexa-acylated glucosamine disaccharide phosphorylated at the 1 and 4′ position with acyl chains from 12 to 14 carbons in length and an asymmetric (4/2) distribution (14.Schromm A.B.

Res. 2006; 12: 205-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). During the synthesis of the lipid A, first a tetra-acylated core structure carrying R-3-hydroxymyristate at the 2-, 3-, 2′-, and 3′-positions, called lipid IVA, is generated, which is conserved in most of the Gram-negative bacteria (18.Raetz C.R.

Subsequently, the late acyltransferases HtrB (also called LpxL) and MsbB (also called LpxM) transfer a lauroyl fatty acid to the 3′-position (HtrB (20.Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.

In some bacteria there are alternative pathways leading to a modified structure of lipid A, and these may depend on environmental conditions, e.g. a palmitoleic acid is incorporated at the 3′-position (palmitoleoylation) instead of the lauroyl chain, catalyzed by LpxP in E. coli under cold shock conditions (22.Carty S.M.

Changes to the structure of the lipid A, either by removal of critical components or by replacement of one of the acyl chains by a different acyl residue, affects the binding and recognition by TLR4 and results in a lower endotoxicity in vitro (14.Schromm A.B.

A primary focus for reducing the reactogenicity of lipid A has been the modification of the acylation by inactivation of the genes encoding the late acyltransferases HtrB (20.Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R. Function of the htrB high temperature requirement gene of Escherichia coli in the acylation of lipid A: HtrB catalyzed incorporation of laurate.J. Biol.

The resulting predominantly penta-acylated lipid A showed a strong decrease of reactogenicity in human cells. For example, an htrB mutant of Haemophilus influenzae elicited a 40-fold lower expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) than the wild type (24.Nichols W.A. Raetz C.R.H. Clementz T. Smith A.L.

Endotoxin Res. 1997; 4: 163-172Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and purified LPS from an E. coli ΔmsbB mutant had a 10,000-fold decreased ability to induce TNF-α production (25.Somerville Jr., J.E.

Invest. 1996; 97: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Shigella carries two copies of the msbB gene, one encoded on the chromosome (msbB1) and the other on the virulence plasmid (msbB2) (26.D'Hauteville H. Khan S. Maskell D.J. Kussak A. Weintraub A.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 5240-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutant strains of S. flexneri 5 lacking both copies showed an 11–20-fold lower capability to induce TNF-α from adherent human monocytes (26.D'Hauteville H. Khan S. Maskell D.J. Kussak A. Weintraub A. Mathison J. Ulevitch R.J. Wuscher N. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 5240-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An msbB double mutant strain of S. flexneri 2a was shown to elicit decreased cytokine responses from a murine macrophage line (27.Ranallo R.T. Kaminski R.W. George T. Kordis A.A. Chen Q. Szabo K. Venkatesan M.M. Virulence, inflammatory potential, and adaptive immunity induced by Shigella flexneri msbB mutants.Infect. Immun. 2010; 78: 400-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but it has not been reported to be tested with human cells. Previously, we showed that genetic lipid A modification is compatible with the high yield production process using a S. sonnei ΔmsbB GMMA-producing strain (2.Berlanda Scorza F. Colucci A.M. Maggiore L. Sanzone S. Rossi O. Ferlenghi I. Pesce I. Caboni M. Norais N. Di Cioccio V. Saul A. Gerke C. High yield production process for Shigella outer membrane particles.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e35616Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, as that study focused on production, reactogenicity tests with the resulting GMMA were not performed. In this study, we investigate the effects of msbB and htrB deletions on the lipid A structure in GMMA-producing strains of S. sonnei and S. flexneri 2a and the relative activation by the resulting GMMA of the TLR4 and TLR2 pathways in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in cells transfected with human TLR4 and TLR2. We show that the penta-acylated lipid A generated by the msbB mutation has a 600-fold lower ability to stimulate TLR4 than wild-type lipid A, whereas the penta-acylated lipid A from the S. sonnei ΔhtrB mutant is 60,000-fold less active. We further demonstrate that the cytokine production in PBMC stimulated by GMMA with penta-acylated lipid A is substantially reduced and similar for GMMA from S. sonnei ΔhtrB (800-fold) and S. sonnei and S. flexneri 2a ΔmsbB mutants (300-fold) and that the residual cytokine production is largely due to TLR2 activation. We also show that, in contrast to S. sonnei ΔhtrB, a compensatory palmitoleoylation occurs in the S. flexneri 2a ΔhtrB mutant resulting in a high proportion of hexa-acylated lipid A with substantial ability to activate TLR4, albeit requiring approximately an order of magnitude higher concentration than the isogenic cell line.

https://openalex.org/W2073722695,"To explore the mechanisms underlying the suggested role of the vitamin D/vitamin D receptor (VDR) complex in the pathogenesis of obesity we performed genetic and immunologic analyses in obese and non-obese Saudi individuals without other concomitant chronic diseases. Genomic DNA was genotyped for gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VDR by allelic discrimination in 402 obese (body mass index –BMI≥30 kg/m2) and 489 non-obese (BMI<30 kg/m2) Saudis. Q-PCR analyses were performed using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System. The inflammosome pathway was analysed by PCR, cytokines and plasma lipopolysaccaride (LPS) concentrations with ELISA assays. Results showed that the VDR SNPs rs731236 (G) (TaqI) and rs1544410 (T) (Bsm-I) minor allele polymorphisms are significantly more frequent in obese individuals (p = 0.009, β = 0.086 and p = 0.028, β = 0.072, respectively). VDR haplotypes identified are positively (GTA) (p = 0.008, β = 1.560); or negatively (ACC) (p = 0.044, β = 0.766) associated with obesity and higher BMI scores. The GTA ""risk"" haplotype was characterized by an up-regulation of inflammosome components, a higher production of proinflammatory cytokines (p<0.05) and a lower VDR expression. Plasma LPS concentration was also increased in GTA obese individuals (p<0.05), suggesting an alteration of gut permeability leading to microbial translocation. Data herein indicate that polymorphisms affecting the vitamin D/VDR axis play a role in obesity that is associated with an ongoing degree of inflammation, possibly resulting from alterations of gut permeability and microbial translocation. These results could help the definition of VDR fingerprints that predict an increased risk of developing obesity and might contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic strategies for this metabolic condition."
https://openalex.org/W2025189372,"Autophagy is one of the major degradation pathways for cytoplasmic components. The autophagic isolation membrane is a unique membrane whose content of unsaturated fatty acids is very high. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying formation of this membrane, including the roles of unsaturated fatty acids, remain to be elucidated. From a chemical library consisting of structurally diverse compounds, we screened for novel inhibitors of starvation-induced autophagy by measuring LC3 puncta formation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts stably expressing GFP-LC3. One of the inhibitors we identified, 2,5-pyridinedicarboxamide, N2,N5-bis[5-[(dimethylamino)carbonyl]-4-methyl-2-thiazolyl], has a molecular structure similar to that of a known stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) 1 inhibitor. To determine whether SCD1 inhibition influences autophagy, we examined the effects of the SCD1 inhibitor 28c. This compound strongly inhibited starvation-induced autophagy, as determined by LC3 puncta formation, immunoblot analyses of LC3, electron microscopic observations, and p62/SQSTM1 accumulation. Overexpression of SCD1 or supplementation with oleic acid, which is a catalytic product of SCD1 abolished the inhibition of autophagy by 28c. Furthermore, 28c suppressed starvation-induced autophagy without affecting mammalian target of rapamycin activity, and also inhibited rapamycin-induced autophagy. In addition to inhibiting formation of LC3 puncta, 28c also inhibited formation of ULK1, WIPI1, Atg16L, and p62/SQSTM1 puncta. These results suggest that SCD1 activity is required for the earliest step of autophagosome formation."
https://openalex.org/W2020838623,"The Wilms' tumor transcription factor (WT1) was originally classified as a tumor suppressor, but it is now known to also be associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in several malignancies. WT1 plays an essential role in orchestrating a developmental process known as mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) during kidney development, but also induces the reverse process, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during heart development. WT1 is not expressed in the adult kidney, but shows elevated expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, the role of WT1 in this disease has not been characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that WT1 is upregulated in ccRCC cells that are deficient in the expression of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL). We found that WT1 transcriptionally activated Snail, a master transcriptional repressor that is known to induce EMT. Although Snail represses E-cadherin and induces mesenchymal characteristics, we found partial maintenance of E-cadherin and associated epithelial characteristics in kidney cells and ccRCC cells that express WT1, since WT1 upregulates E-cadherin expression and competes with Snail repression. These findings support a novel paradigm in which WT1 induces an epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid transition (EMHT), characterized by Snail up-regulation with E-cadherin maintenance, a tumor cell differentiation state in which cancer cells keep both EMT and MET characteristics which may promote tumor cell plasticity and tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2039486119,"Dapper homolog (DACT) 2 is one of the Dact gene family members, which are important modulators of Wnt signaling pathway. We aim to clarify its epigenetic inactivation, biological function and clinical implication in colon cancer. DACT2 was silenced in five out of eight colon cancer cell lines, but robustly expressed in normal colon tissues. The loss of DACT2 expression was regulated by promoter hypermethylation. Restoring DACT2 expression in colon cancer cell lines suppressed tumor cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, DACT2 overexpression effectively reduced lung metastasis of colon cancer cells in nude mice. These effects by DACT2 were attributed to inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Reexpression of DACT2 significantly suppressed the transcriptional activity of both wild-type β-catenin and degradation-resistant form mutant β-catenin (S33Y). DACT2 could actively shuttle into and out of nuclei, with its predominant steady-state localization in the cytoplasm dependent on its nuclear export signal. Co-immunoprecipitation results indicated that DACT2 strongly associated β-catenin as well as lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) and directly disrupted the formation of the β-catenin–LEF1 complex in the nucleus. Whereas in the cytoplasm, DACT2 restored junctional localization of E-cadherin–β-catenin complexes and prevented β-catenin nuclear translocation through direct interaction with β-catenin. DACT2 methylation was detected in 43.3% (29/67) of colon cancer tissues, but none in normal controls. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with DACT2 methylation had a significant decrease in overall survival (P=0.006). Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed that DACT2 methylation was significantly associated with shortened survival in stage I–III colon cancer patients. In conclusion, DACT2 acts as a functional tumor suppressor in colon cancer through inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Its methylation at early stages of colon carcinogenesis is an independent prognostic factor."
https://openalex.org/W1980502224,"Cancer cells undergo a metabolic transformation that allows for increased anabolic demands, wherein glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates are shunted away for the synthesis of biological molecules required for cell growth and division. One of the key shunts is the exit of citrate from the mitochondria and the TCA cycle for the generation of cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A that can be used for fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. With the loss of mitochondrial citrate, cancer cells rely on the ‘conditionally essential’ amino acid glutamine (Q) as an anaplerotic carbon source for TCA cycle intermediates. Although Q deprivation causes G1 cell cycle arrest in non-transformed cells, its impact on the cancer cell cycle is not well characterized. We report here a correlation between bypass of the Q-dependent G1 checkpoint and cancer cells harboring K-Ras mutations. Instead of arresting in G1 in response to Q-deprivation, K-Ras-driven cancer cells arrest in either S- or G2/M-phase. Inhibition of K-Ras effector pathways was able to revert cells to G1 arrest upon Q deprivation. Blocking anaplerotic utilization of Q mimicked Q deprivation—causing S- and G2/M-phase arrest in K-Ras mutant cancer cells. Significantly, Q deprivation or suppression of anaplerotic Q utilization created synthetic lethality to the cell cycle phase-specific cytotoxic drugs, capecitabine and paclitaxel. These data suggest that disabling of the G1 Q checkpoint could represent a novel vulnerability of cancer cells harboring K-Ras and possibly other mutations that disable the Q-dependent checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W2014976589,"In mammalian mitochondria, protein methylation is a relatively uncommon post-transcriptional modification, and the extent of the mitochondrial protein methylome, the modifying methyltransferases, and their substrates have been little studied. As shown here, the β-subunit of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) is one such methylated protein. The ETF is a heterodimer of α- and β-subunits. Lysine residues 199 and 202 of mature ETFβ are almost completely trimethylated in bovine heart mitochondria, whereas ETFα is not methylated. The enzyme responsible for the modifications was identified as methyltransferase-like protein 20 (METTL20). In human 143B cells, the methylation of ETFβ is less extensive and is diminished further by suppression of METTL20. Tagged METTL20 expressed in HEK293T cells specifically associates with the ETF and promotes the trimethylation of ETFβ lysine residues 199 and 202. ETF serves as a mobile electron carrier linking dehydrogenases involved in fatty acid oxidation and one-carbon metabolism to the membrane-associated ubiquinone pool. The methylated residues in ETFβ are immediately adjacent to a protein loop that recognizes and binds to the dehydrogenases. Suppression of trimethylation of ETFβ in mouse C2C12 cells oxidizing palmitate as an energy source reduced the consumption of oxygen by the cells. These experiments suggest that the oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria and the passage of electrons via the ETF may be controlled by modulating the protein-protein interactions between the reduced dehydrogenases and the β-subunit of the ETF by trimethylation of lysine residues.

As described below, we have found that another mitochondrial protein, the β-subunit of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) is also methylated. The ETF is a heterodimeric complex of α- and β-subunits, known as ETFα and ETFβ, respectively (26.Gorelick R.J. Mizzer J.P. Thorpe C.

It acts as a mobile electron carrier in the matrix of mitochondria, linking 11 different mitochondrial FAD-containing acyl-CoA dehydrogenases involved in fatty acid β-oxidation to the ubiquinone pool of the respiratory chain (30.Ghisla S. Thorpe C. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases: a mechanistic overview.Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 494-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 31.He M. Pei Z. Mohsen A.W. Watkins P. Murdoch G.

Metab. 2011; 102: 418-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The ETF also accepts electrons from sarcosine dehydrogenase and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase, two enzymes of mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism (32.Steenkamp D.J. Husain M. The effect of tetrahydrofolate on the reduction of electron transfer flavoprotein by sarcosine and dimethylglycine dehydrogenases.Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A “recognition loop” in ETFβ recognizes and interacts with these 13 different dehydrogenases (33.Toogood H.S. van Thiel A. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. Extensive domain motion and electron transfer in the human electron transferring flavoprotein medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase complex.J. Biol.

Dynamics driving function: new insights from electron transferring flavoproteins and partner complexes.FEBS J. 2007; 274: 5481-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the sites of methylation are immediately adjacent to the recognition loop. Once bound to the recognition loop, the dehydrogenases reduce an FAD prosthetic group in the ETF. Then the reduced ETF carries the electrons to the ETF-quinone oxidoreductase bound in the inner mitochondrial membrane (35.Watmough N.J. Frerman F.E. The electron transfer flavoprotein: ubiquinone oxidoreductases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The precise mode of interaction of ETF with the quinone oxidoreductase is not known, but ETFβ is involved in the formation of this complex (36.Steenkamp D.J. Cross-linking of the electron-transfer flavoprotein to electron-transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase with heterobifunctional reagents.Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finally, the reduced ETF-quinone oxidoreductase transfers the electrons to ubiquinone, and the reduced quinone enters the quinone pool, providing electrons for the cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III) to reduce cytochrome c. The location of the methylated lysine residues characterized in the current study, immediately adjacent to the recognition loop, suggests that their methylation may influence the interactions of the ETF with the dehydrogenases and possibly with ETF-quinone oxidoreductase, and that it could provide a mechanism of regulating the β-oxidation of fatty acids. We have also identified METTL20 (methyltransferase-like protein 20) as the mitochondrial methyltransferase that introduces methyl groups into two specific lysine residues in ETFβ. No protein lysine methyltransferase had been characterized previously in mitochondria. Human 143B osteosarcoma cells (ATCC number CRL8303) and mouse C2C12 myoblasts (Public Health England 91031101) were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS, 10% v/v), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The serum in the media for parental human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) and FLAG-strepII-tagged METTL20 inducible HEK293T cells was tetracycline-free, and the media included blasticidin (15 μg/ml) and zeocin (100 μg/ml), or blasticidin (15 μg/ml) and hygromycin (100 μg/ml), respectively. The cDNA for human METTL20 (Thermo Scientific, Loughborough, UK) was amplified by PCR with the forward and reverse primers: 5′-CGCGGATCCGGAATGGCTTTGAGTCTAGGTTGGAAAG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCCCAGGCTGAAAACCCCACACTGTGC-3′, respectively. It was cloned into the inducible expression vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) with sequences encoding C-terminal FLAG and Strep tags, and incorporated stably into HEK293T Flp-InTM T-RexTM cells. Plasmids were transfected into 143B cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the mitochondria were labeled with MitoTracker Orange (200 nm; Invitrogen), and the nuclei were stained with DAPI (0.4 μg/ml). The same cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%, w/v) and permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.5%, v/v). The FLAG-tagged METTL20 was detected with mouse M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) followed by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen). The fluorescent signal was visualized with a Zeiss 510 LSM confocal microscope (Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). Submitochondrial particles were prepared from bovine heart mitochondria (37.Pryde K.R. Hirst J.

They were centrifuged (37,000 × g for 20 min, and then at 110,000 × g for 30 min), and the supernatant was fractionated at room temperature by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The 60–90% fraction was re-solubilized in buffer A (pH 7.4) consisting of 25 mm HEPES and 0.1 mm EDTA, dialyzed against the same buffer, and fractionated by cation exchange chromatography on a HiTrap SP HP column (1 ml; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The sample was loaded onto the column equilibrated in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–150 mm NaCl in buffer A over 60 min at room temperature. Fractions containing the partially purified ETF were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Plasmid pcDNATM5/FRT/TO encoding METTL20 with C-terminal StrepII and FLAG tags was cotransfected in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with plasmid pOG44 into human HEK293T Flp-In T-Rex cells (total DNA, 1 μg; pOG44:pcDNA5/FRT/TO, 7:1 by weight) (Invitrogen) (38.He J.

After 24 h, the medium was replaced with the selective medium containing blasticidin (15 μg/ml) and hygromycin (100 μg/ml) and inducible cell lines expressing the recombinant protein were selected.

To prepare mitoplasts, cells were suspended at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in PBS-inhibitor (phosphate-buffered saline with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor from Roche Applied Science) and enriched for mitoplasts by addition of an equal volume of digitonin (1 mg/ml) in PBS-inhibitor to give a detergent:protein ratio of 1:10 (w/w) (39.Klement P.

The sample was centrifuged (11,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and mitoplasts were solubilized from the pellet with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. The enriched mitochondrial protein preparation was loaded onto a StrepII tag gravity column (Pierce Spin Column containing Strep-Tactin-Sepharose) followed by 5 column volumes of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Roche protease inhibitor (1/50; v/v), and 0.05% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside). Bound protein was eluted with 6 portions of 0.5 column volumes of wash buffer containing 10 mm desthiobiotin. Eluates 1–3 were combined and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Transcripts of METTL20 were suppressed transiently in human 143B cells with 30 nm siRNAs and transcripts of METTL20 or ETFβ in mouse C2C12 cells with 100 nm siRNAs (Sigma). Allstars negative control siRNA (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) was used at the same concentration as the specific siRNA. Two transfections were performed at 0 and 72 h. The levels of the transcripts (normalized to endogenous β-actin) were investigated at 48 and 120 h by quantitative real-time PCR performed with TaqMan gene expression assays (Invitrogen) on cDNA prepared with a Cells-to-CT kit (Invitrogen). Mitoplasts were prepared 48 h after each transfection, and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of C2C12 cells was assessed 48 h after the second transfection. Protein concentrations were estimated by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, ThermoFisher). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on Novex Tris glycine 10–20% acrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen) and transferred electrophoretically to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) for immunodetection. The membrane was washed in PBS containing 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST), and then treated with a solution of dried skimmed milk, or where anti-methyl antibodies were to be employed, with bovine serum albumin (3%, w/v) in the same buffer. Bound proteins were reacted with primary rabbit antibodies with specificities for dimethyllysine and trimethyllysine (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for ETFβ and citrate synthase (Proteintech, Manchester, UK) and NDUFB8 (Sigma). Bound rabbit antibodies were peroxidase conjugated with goat anti-rabbit antiserum (ThermoFisher), and detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare). Bovine, human, and mouse proteins in extracts and column fractions were reduced, alkylated, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE in 12–22 or 10–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels, as described before (25.Rhein V.F. Carroll J. Ding S. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. NDUFAF7 methylates arginine 85 in the NDUFS2 subunit of human complex I.J. Biol.

Proteins were characterized by tandem-MS analysis of tryptic, chymotryptic, and AspN digests of Coomassie Blue-stained bands or sections of gel. Extracted peptides were analyzed in a MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer (model 4800; AB-Sciex, Warrington UK) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix, or in an LTQ OrbiTrap XL-ETD (electron transfer dissociation) mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Proxeon Easy-nLC (Thermo Scientific) with a C18 column (100 mm × 75 μm inner diameter; Nanoseparations, Nieukoop, The Netherlands) for reverse-phase fractionation of peptides using an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid with a solvent flow rate of 300 nl/min. Peptides were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation with either air (4800 instrument) or nitrogen (LTQ OrbiTrap XL-ETD), or by ETD with fluoranthene radical anions (LTQ OrbiTrap XL-ETD) and supplemental activation (40.Swaney D.L.

https://openalex.org/W2076819352,"Gram positive (G+) infections make up ∼50% of all acute lung injury cases which are characterized by extensive permeability edema secondary to disruption of endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity. A primary cause of increased permeability are cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) of G+-bacteria, such as pneumolysin (PLY) and listeriolysin-O (LLO) which create plasma membrane pores, promoting Ca2+-influx and activation of PKCα. In human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC), pretreatment with the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, ETU reduced the ability of LLO to increase microvascular cell permeability suggesting an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-dependent mechanism. LLO stimulated superoxide production from HLMVEC and this was prevented by silencing PKCα or NOS inhibition suggesting a link between these pathways. Both LLO and PLY stimulated eNOS T495 phosphorylation in a PKC-dependent manner. Expression of a phosphomimetic T495D eNOS (human isoform) resulted in increased superoxide and diminished nitric oxide (NO) production. Transduction of HLMVEC with an active form of PKCα resulted in the robust phosphorylation of T495 and increased peroxynitrite production, indicative of eNOS uncoupling. To determine the mechanisms underlying eNOS uncoupling, HLMVEC were stimulated with LLO and the amount of hsp90 and caveolin-1 bound to eNOS determined. LLO stimulated the dissociation of hsp90, and in particular, caveolin-1 from eNOS. Both hsp90 and caveolin-1 have been shown to influence eNOS uncoupling and a peptide mimicking the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 blocked the ability of PKCα to stimulate eNOS-derived superoxide. Collectively, these results suggest that the G+ pore-forming toxins promote increased EC permeability via activation of PKCα, phosphorylation of eNOS-T495, loss of hsp90 and caveolin-1 binding which collectively promote eNOS uncoupling and the production of barrier disruptive superoxide."
https://openalex.org/W2047047579,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous subgroup of breast cancer with poor prognosis and no targeted therapy available. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are emerging targets in anticancer therapy and many RTK-inhibiting drugs are currently being developed. The aim of this study was to elucidate if there is a correlation between the protein expression of three RTKs c-KIT, VEGFR2 and PDGFRα, their gene copy number, and prognosis in TNBC compared to non-TNBC.Tumor tissue samples from patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer were stained with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for protein assessment, and with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for gene copy number determination. Breast cancer mortality (BCM), measured from the date of surgery to death, was used as endpoint.The cohort included 464 patients, out of which 34 (7.3%) had a TNBC. High expression of the three RTKs was more common in TNBC compared to non-TNBC: c-KIT 49% vs. 10% (P<0.001), PDGFRα 32% vs. 19% (P = 0.07) and VEGFR2 32% vs. 6% (P<0.001). The odds ratio (OR) of c-KIT, VEGFR2 and PDGFRα positivity, adjusted for tumor characteristics, was 6.8, 3.6 and 1.3 times higher for TNBC than for non-TNBC. 73.5% of the TNBC had high expression of at least one of the three investigated receptors, compared to 30.0% of the non-TNBC (P<0.001). Survival analysis showed no significant difference in BCM for TNBC patients with high vs. low c-KIT, PDGFRα or VEGFR2 protein expression. 193 (42%) tumors were evaluated with FISH. No correlation was seen between increased gene copy number and TNBC, or between increased gene copy number and high protein expression of the RTK.c-KIT, VEGFR2 and PDGFRα show higher protein expression in TNBC compared to non-TNBC. Further investigation clarifying the importance of these RTKs in TNBC is encouraged, as they are possible targets for anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2084998185,"Mutations of the tumor suppressor gene von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) can lead to benign and malignant tumors, including clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). To understand the progression of ccRCC, we generated a novel mouse Vhlh conditional knockout, using Hoxb7-driven Cre that is specific for the collecting ducts and a subset of distal tubules. These mice exhibited wide-spread epithelial disruption and interstitial inflammation as early as 2 months of age with high penetrance. Lesions are cystic, show severe fibrosis and display significant hyperplasia. An abundance of infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes was detected. Interestingly, the Vhlh mutant lesions could be rescued when Hif-1α, but not Hif-2α, was also knocked out. In addition, administration of a JAK1/2 kinase inhibitor alleviated the Vhlh knockout phenotypes. Taken together, these results suggest that HIF-1α-dependent inflammation and fibrosis may be an early event in the development of ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W1973559979,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of genotype imputation on the performance of the GBLUP and Bayesian methods for genomic prediction. A total of 10,309 Holstein bulls were genotyped on the BovineSNP50 BeadChip (50 k). Five low density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels, containing 6,177, 2,480, 1,536, 768 and 384 SNPs, were simulated from the 50 k panel. A fraction of 0%, 33% and 66% of the animals were randomly selected from the training sets to have low density genotypes which were then imputed into 50 k genotypes. A GBLUP and a Bayesian method were used to predict direct genomic values (DGV) for validation animals using imputed or their actual 50 k genotypes. Traits studied included milk yield, fat percentage, protein percentage and somatic cell score (SCS). Results showed that performance of both GBLUP and Bayesian methods was influenced by imputation errors. For traits affected by a few large QTL, the Bayesian method resulted in greater reductions of accuracy due to imputation errors than GBLUP. Including SNPs with largest effects in the low density panel substantially improved the accuracy of genomic prediction for the Bayesian method. Including genotypes imputed from the 6 k panel achieved almost the same accuracy of genomic prediction as that of using the 50 k panel even when 66% of the training population was genotyped on the 6 k panel. These results justified the application of the 6 k panel for genomic prediction. Imputations from lower density panels were more prone to errors and resulted in lower accuracy of genomic prediction. But for animals that have close relationship to the reference set, genotype imputation may still achieve a relatively high accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2086626108,"Although it is known that the unfolded protein response (UPR) plays a significant role in the process of plasma cell differentiation, the contribution of the individual sensors of the UPR to this process remains unclear. In this study we examine the death signals and compensatory survival signals activated during B cell activation and the first stages of plasma cell differentiation. During in vitro differentiation of both primary murine B cells and the Bcl1 cell line, we demonstrate that in addition to activation of the physiological UPR, changes in the expression of several Bcl-2 proteins occur, which are consistent with a lowering of the apoptotic threshold of the cell. Specifically, we observed decreased expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and increased expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim. However, these changes were countered by Bcl-xL induction, which is necessary to protect differentiating cells both from ER stress-induced death by tunicamycin and from the death signals inherent in differentiation. Consistent with differentiating cells becoming dependent on Bcl-xL for survival, the addition of ABT-737 resulted in apoptosis in differentiating cells through the inhibition of sequestration of Bim. Confirming this result, differentiation in the context of RNAi-mediated Bcl-xL knockdown also induced apoptosis. This cell death is C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)-dependent, connecting these events to the UPR. Thus plasma cell differentiation proceeds through a Bcl-xL-dependent intermediate. Although it is known that the unfolded protein response (UPR) plays a significant role in the process of plasma cell differentiation, the contribution of the individual sensors of the UPR to this process remains unclear.

Specifically, we observed decreased expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and increased expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim. However, these changes were countered by Bcl-xL induction, which is necessary to protect differentiating cells both from ER stress-induced death by tunicamycin and from the death signals inherent in differentiation. Consistent with differentiating cells becoming dependent on Bcl-xL for survival, the addition of ABT-737 resulted in apoptosis in differentiating cells through the inhibition of sequestration of Bim. Confirming this result, differentiation in the context of RNAi-mediated Bcl-xL knockdown also induced apoptosis. This cell death is C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)-dependent, connecting these events to the UPR. Thus plasma cell differentiation proceeds through a Bcl-xL-dependent intermediate. Plasma cell differentiation involves striking changes in the morphology and physiology of the cell. To become a professional antibody-secreting cell, the B cell must increase the size and capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumUPRunfolded protein responseCHOPC/EBP homologous proteinC/EBPCCAAT-enhancer-binding proteinPERKPKR-like ER kinase. and secretory apparatus (1.Gass J.N.

To accomplish this end, the cell activates a set of signaling pathways known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (2.Gass J.N. Gifford N.M. Brewer J.W.

During periods of ER stress when the protein load in the ER outweighs its folding capacity, three sensors of ER stress, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), are activated (3.Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. ER stress and the unfolded protein response.Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). These sensors reside across the ER membrane with their luminal tails bound to the ER chaperone Bip (GRP78) keeping them in an inactive state. When unfolded protein builds in the ER, Bip is titrated off the luminal tails of these signaling molecules. ATF6 translocates to the Golgi where it is cleaved to yield p50ATF6, a transcription factor that up-regulates ER quality control and capacity (4.Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K.

The expansion of the secretory capacity necessary for a B cell to become a professional antibody-secreting cell makes use of the UPR machinery already present in all cells. It must however overcome the effects of PERK activation including translation inhibition and apoptosis. ATF6 and IRE1 are activated and XBP1 is spliced during plasma cell differentiation, and they are necessary to form plasma cells in vivo as animals deficient in any of these genes lack plasma cells (2.Gass J.N.

Conversely, perk−/− animals have plasma cells, and PERK is not significantly activated during plasma cell differentiation (25.Gass J.N. Jiang H.Y. Wek R.C. Brewer J.W.

Plasma cell differentiation initiates a limited ER stress response by specifically suppressing the PERK-dependent branch of the unfolded protein response.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010; 15: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although it is true that ATF4, p50ATF6, and XBP1s all bind to the promoter of CHOP, only ATF4 has been shown to be necessary for CHOP activation (18.Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. Two distinct stress signaling pathways converge upon the CHOP promoter during the mammalian unfolded protein response.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Therefore it stands to reason that inactivation of PERK would inhibit ATF4 and CHOP, relieving the cell of translation inhibition and the proapoptotic effects of CHOP. However, it has also been shown that some activation of CHOP is necessary for production of a maximally efficient plasma cell as Chop−/− animals have plasma cells that secrete immunoglobulin at a lower rate than wild type animals (27.Masciarelli S. Fra A.M. Pengo N. Bertolotti M. Cenci S. Fagioli C. Ron D. Hendershot L.M. Sitia R. CHOP-independent apoptosis and pathway-selective induction of the UPR in developing plasma cells.Mol. Immunol. 2010; 47: 1356-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore the proapoptotic aspects of CHOP signaling must be overcome for optimal plasma cell differentiation. During all stages of B cell development, there are prosurvival and proapoptotic proteins responsible for determining which B cells are propagated and which are deleted from the repertoire. The Bcl-2 family of proteins responsible for regulating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis plays a major role in this survival signaling (28.Strasser A. Bouillet P. The control of apoptosis in lymphocyte selection.Immunol. Rev. 2003; 193: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J.

Mcl-1 is essential for germinal center formation and B cell memory.Science. 2010; 330: 1095-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This is true in mature B cells and in plasma cells, but less is known about this pathway during the transition between these cell types. The multidomain antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL are important in B cell survival. They function by binding and sequestering proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, such as Bim (31.Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell death: critical control points.Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar, 32.Cory S. Adams J.M. The Bcl2 family: regulators of the cellular life-or-death switch.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3324) Google Scholar). This prevents Bim from activating Bax and Bak, which when active induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, resulting in cytochrome c release that leads to downstream caspase activation and apoptosis. This function of antiapoptotic proteins can now be targeted by a class of drugs called BH3 mimetics. These are small molecules that bind to and antagonize the antiapoptotic proteins. ABT-737, a mimetic of the BH3-only protein Bad, binds to Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bcl-w, displacing Bim and leading to apoptosis in cells that are dependent on one of these proteins for survival (33.Oltersdorf T. Elmore S.W. Shoemaker A.R. Armstrong R.C. Augeri D.J. Belli B.A. Bruncko M. Deckwerth T.L. Dinges J. Hajduk P.J. Joseph M.K. Kitada S. Korsmeyer S.J. Kunzer A.R. Letai A. Li C. Mitten M.J.

An inhibitor of Bcl-2 family proteins induces regression of solid tumours.Nature. 2005; 435: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). ABT-737 does not bind Mcl-1 and therefore will not cause apoptosis in a cell that is dependent on Mcl-1 for survival. In murine immunization models, it has been shown that germinal center B cells and existing plasma cells are insensitive to ABT-737 (34.Carrington E.M. Vikstrom I.B. Light A. Sutherland R.M. Londrigan S.L. Mason K.D. Huang D.C. Lew A.M. Tarlinton D.M. BH3 mimetics antagonizing restricted prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins represent another class of selective immune modulatory drugs.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 10967-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has also been shown that these cell types are dependent on Mcl-1 for survival (30.Vikstrom I.

These studies did show that there was a deficit in newly formed plasma cells in the presence of ABT-737; however, the molecular basis for this deficit was not fully defined. In this study we define the molecular basis of differential Bcl-2 family dependence during plasma cell differentiation. The Bcl1 cell line, clone CW13.20.3B3, was acquired from ATCC (CRL-1699). Primary murine B cells were prepared from splenocytes isolated from C57BL/6 spleens and depleted of non-B cells and activated B cells by magnetic bead column separation (Miltenyi B cell isolation kit 130-090-862, LS columns).

Bcl1 cells were then infected and selected with puromycin. Transductants were kept in selection during passage and verified by Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR. Experiments were carried out in the absence of puromycin. Cells were collected at the various time points and treatments. 0.25–0.5 million cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of FACS buffer (1% BSA in PBS containing 0.01% sodium azide) and the appropriate amount of antibody for 30 min at 4 °C.

Lysates were prepared in 2% CHAPS buffer. 100 μg of protein was used for each antibody for each sample. Samples were precleared with protein G and preclearing matrix for 2 h. Immunoprecipitation matrices were prepared using 3 μg of the appropriate antibody. Precleared lysates were rocked in immunoprecipitation matrices overnight.

ELISA was performed according to protocol using the mouse IgM ELISA kit (Bethyl Laboratories). Supernatants were diluted 1:4 and loaded at 25 μl/well and then calibrated to live cell number counted using trypan blue exclusion.

The murine B cell leukemia cell line Bcl1 can be stimulated to differentiate to an antibody-secreting cell using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines (39.Blackman M.A. Tigges M.A. Minie M.E.

We tested combinations of previously described differentiation stimuli including IL-2, IL-5, and LPS and found that the combination of IL-5 and LPS was as efficient a differentiation stimulus as the combination of all three (not shown). Consistent with published data (40.Mita S. Harada N. Naomi S. Hitoshi Y. Sakamoto K. Akagi M. Tominaga A. Takatsu K.

Med. 1988; 168: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), this cell line has high basal expression of the IL-5 receptor (not shown). Differentiating Bcl1 cells display phenotypic changes associated with the early stages of plasma cell differentiation including up-regulation of CD138, CD19, and CD44 along with down-regulation of surface IgM (Fig. 1A). To examine the effects of UPR activation on plasma cell differentiation, we induced ER stress with an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, tunicamycin. A 5-h pulse of tunicamycin activated the UPR as demonstrated by increased expression of CHOP and XBP1 (not shown). These cells rapidly underwent apoptosis unless LPS was included in the differentiation stimulus following the tunicamycin pulse (Fig. 1B, and not shown). Although IL-5 was not sufficient on its own to protect cells, only those cells that received both LPS and IL-5 produced and secreted antibody at a rate similar or greater than cells that did not receive tunicamycin pretreatment (Fig. 1, C and D, and not shown). These data demonstrate that Bcl1 cells are sensitive to ER stress-induced cell death yet are protected by LPS signaling during differentiation. Because plasma cell differentiation induces parts of the unfolded protein response, we chose to further examine the activation of this pathway during ER stress and differentiation. All cells treated with the combination of LPS and IL-5 displayed a large increase in the ER chaperones GRP94 and GRP78 (Bip) regardless of tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this observation, activation of IRE1, as measured by XBP1 splicing, was highest in cells treated with both LPS and IL-5 throughout the time course (Fig. 2B). Together these data suggest that differentiation of Bcl1 cells results in the activation of a physiologic UPR and that tunicamycin does not influence this response. In cells pulsed with tunicamycin for 5 h, we observed phosphorylation of eIF2α at higher levels than untreated cells at 24- and 48-h time points by Western blot (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylated eIF2α was not observed when cells were differentiated in the absence of tunicamycin, a finding consistent with PERK activation not being part of plasma cell differentiation. Protein levels of ATF4 and CHOP, both downstream effectors of the PERK arm of the UPR, were also increased by tunicamycin addition. Cells that received tunicamycin without differentiation stimulus do not show as robust activation of this arm downstream of eIF2α phosphorylation, but it is important to note that the viability of these cells was very low at these time points (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, all cells treated with LPS and IL-5 in the absence of tunicamycin also demonstrated robust and prolonged expression of b"

Optical microscopy of such specimen is curtailed by the diffraction-limited resolution of conventional optical microscopy. To overcome this limitation, we used STED super-resolution microscopy enabling optical resolution well below the diffraction barrier. We visualized nanoscale protein distributions in sections of well-annotated paraffin-embedded human rectal cancer tissue stored in a clinical repository. Using antisera against several mitochondrial proteins, STED microscopy revealed distinct sub-mitochondrial protein distributions, suggesting a high level of structural preservation. Analysis of human tissues stored for up to 17 years demonstrated that these samples were still amenable for super-resolution microscopy. STED microscopy of sections of HER2 positive rectal adenocarcinoma revealed details in the surface and intracellular HER2 distribution that were blurred in the corresponding conventional images, demonstrating the potential of super-resolution microscopy to explore the thus far largely untapped nanoscale regime in tissues stored in biorepositories."
https://openalex.org/W1963597400,"PDZ domain proteins control multiple cellular functions by governing assembly of protein complexes. It remains unknown why individual PDZ domains can bind the extreme C terminus of very diverse binding partners and maintain selectivity. By employing NMR spectroscopy, together with molecular modeling, mutational analysis, and fluorescent polarization binding experiments, we identify here three structural mechanisms explaining why the PDZ domain of PICK1 selectively binds >30 receptors, transporters, and kinases. Class II ligands, including the dopamine transporter, adopt a canonical binding mode with promiscuity obtained via differential packing in the binding groove. Class I ligands, such as protein kinase Cα, depend on residues upstream from the canonical binding sequence that are likely to interact with flexible loop residues of the PDZ domain. Finally, we obtain evidence that the unconventional ligand ASIC1a has a dual binding mode involving a canonical insertion and a noncanonical internal insertion with the two C-terminal residues forming interactions outside the groove. Together with an evolutionary analysis, the data show how unconventional binding modes might evolve for a protein recognition domain to expand the repertoire of functionally important interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2013582703,"Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) is one of the most common clinical manifestations of diabetes mellitus (DM), which is characterized by prominent mechanical allodynia (DMA). However, the molecular mechanism underlying it has not fully been elucidated. In this study, we examined the spatio-temporal expression of a major nociceptive channel protein transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and analyzed its functional involvement by intrathecal (i.t.) application of TRPV1 antagonists in streptozocin (STZ)-induced DMA rat models. Western blot and immunofluorescent staining results showed that TRPV1 protein level was significantly increased in the soma of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons on 14 days after STZ treatment (DMA 14 d), whereas those in spinal cord and skin (mainly from the central and peripheral processes of DRG neurons) had already been enhanced on DMA 7 d to peak on DMA 14 d. qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that TRPV1 mRNA level was significantly up-regulated in the DRG on DMA 7 d, indicating a preceding translation of TRPV1 protein in the soma but preferential distribution of this protein to the processes under the DMA conditions. Cell counting assay based on double immunostaining suggested that increased TRPV1-immunoreactive neurons were likely to be small-sized and CGRP-ergic. Finally, single or multiple intrathecal applications of non-specific or specific TRPV1 antagonists, ruthenium red and capsazepine, at varying doses, effectively alleviated DMA, although the effect of the former was more prominent and long-lasting. These results collectively indicate that TRPV1 expression dynamically changes during the development of DMA and this protein may play important roles in mechanical nociception in DRG neurons, presumably through facilitating the release of CGRP."
https://openalex.org/W2071388041,"G protein-coupled receptors can be reconstituted as monomers in nanodiscs and as tetramers in liposomes. When reconstituted with G proteins, both forms enable an allosteric interaction between agonists and guanylyl nucleotides. Both forms, therefore, are candidates for the complex that controls signaling at the level of the receptor. To identify the biologically relevant form, reconstituted monomers and tetramers of the purified M2 muscarinic receptor were compared with muscarinic receptors in sarcolemmal membranes for the effect of guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate (GMP-PNP) on the inhibition of N-[3H]methylscopolamine by the agonist oxotremorine-M. With monomers, a stepwise increase in the concentration of GMP-PNP effected a lateral, rightward shift in the semilogarithmic binding profile (i.e. a progressive decrease in the apparent affinity of oxotremorine-M). With tetramers and receptors in sarcolemmal membranes, GMP-PNP effected a vertical, upward shift (i.e. an apparent redistribution of sites from a state of high affinity to one of low affinity with no change in affinity per se). The data were analyzed in terms of a mechanistic scheme based on a ligand-regulated equilibrium between uncoupled and G protein-coupled receptors (the “ternary complex model”). The model predicts a rightward shift in the presence of GMP-PNP and could not account for the effects at tetramers in vesicles or receptors in sarcolemmal membranes. Monomers present a special case of the model in which agonists and guanylyl nucleotides interact within a complex that is both constitutive and stable.

Agonists to GPCRs reveal a dispersion of affinities (i.e. nH < 1) that can be described as a sum of hyperbolic terms representing two or more classes of receptor. In the presence of G protein, guanylyl nucleotides, such as GDP, GTP, and non-hydrolyzable analogues such as GTPγS and GMP-PNP, promote an apparent interconversion of sites from higher to lower affinity such that the binding curve steepens and shifts rightward. Both the breadth of the dispersion in the absence of the nucleotide and the magnitude of the shift are correlated with measures of efficacy at the level of a response (24.Birdsall N.J.M.

Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 410-421PubMed Google Scholar). It follows that the mechanism of the allosteric interaction between an agonist and a guanylyl nucleotide is in effect the mechanism of signaling at the level of the receptor. A common view of G protein-mediated signaling holds that agonists promote the formation of a transient complex between a monomeric receptor (R) and a G protein. As articulated in the ternary complex model (27.De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. A ternary complex model explains the agonist-specific binding properties of the adenylate cyclase-coupled β-adrenergic receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the complex accounts for the sites of higher affinity seen in the binding of agonists, and uncoupled receptors account for the sites of lower affinity; guanylyl nucleotides are thought to promote uncoupling of the RG complex and thereby to convert all of the receptors to the state of low affinity. It is implicit that receptors and G proteins exchange randomly between the complexed state and a pool of protomers. The degree of complexation therefore depends upon the mutual affinity and local concentrations of the reactants, and heterogeneity is induced by the G protein in an otherwise homogeneous population of receptors. Both the β2-adrenergic receptor and the μ-opioid receptor have been reconstituted as monomers in nanodiscs (21.Whorton M.R. Bokoch M.P. Rasmussen S.G. Huang B. Zare R.N. Kobilka B. Sunahara R.K.

In the absence of G protein, sites labeled by a radiolabeled antagonist were of uniformly low affinity for agonists. The introduction of a G protein was accompanied by the appearance of high-affinity sites, and their number increased with the amount of added G protein until they accounted for essentially all of the labeled receptors. Upon the addition of GTPγS at a concentration sufficient to saturate the G proteins, the sites of high affinity were converted to sites of low affinity that resembled receptors in the absence of G protein. A different pattern emerged when monomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor were reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles, where they assembled spontaneously and almost wholly as tetramers (6.Ma A.W.S. Redka D.S. Pisterzi L.F. Angers S. Wells J.W.

The sites appeared heterogeneous to agonists in the absence of G protein, indicating that heterogeneity was intrinsic to the receptor in its tetrameric state; the breadth of the dispersion correlated with efficacy, confirming its relevance to signaling (7.Redka D.S. Heerklotz H. Wells J.W. Efficacy as an intrinsic property of the M2 muscarinic receptor in its tetrameric state.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 7405-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Heterogeneity was retained at saturating concentrations of G protein, and GMP-PNP promoted an interconversion from higher to lower affinity for the agonist (6.Ma A.W.S. Redka D.S. Pisterzi L.F.

Recovery of oligomers and cooperativity when monomers of the M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor are reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7907-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The nucleotide-sensitive, agonist-selective heterogeneity displayed by monomers and tetramers of GPCRs leaves both forms as candidates for the biologically relevant unit of signaling. To distinguish between these possibilities, we have examined the binding properties of M2 muscarinic receptors reconstituted as monomers in nanodiscs and as tetramers in liposomes. Effects in the reconstituted preparations were compared with those at muscarinic receptors in myocardial membranes, taken as an example of a GPCR in its natural environment. Of particular interest has been the binding of agonists at intermediate concentrations of GMP-PNP, which can yield information about the process whereby receptors interconvert from one state of affinity to another. The data have been analyzed in terms of empirical models for the purpose of comparison and in terms of the ternary complex model (27.De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. A ternary complex model explains the agonist-specific binding properties of the adenylate cyclase-coupled β-adrenergic receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for insight into the nature of the interaction between agonist and guanylyl nucleotide. The results indicate that tetramers but not monomers of the M2 receptor resemble muscarinic receptors in myocardial membranes, suggesting that GPCRs signal as oligomers. Only the properties of monomers can be approximated by the ternary complex model and only if the RG complex is essentially constitutive and stable.

The membranes were solubilized in digitonin-cholate (0.86% digitonin, 0.17% cholate), and the receptor was purified via successive passage on DEAE-Sepharose, ABT-Sepharose, and hydroxyapatite. Receptor was recovered from the last column in buffer B (20 mm KH2PO4 adjusted to pH 7.40 with KOH, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF) containing 0.1% digitonin and 0.02% cholate. The eluate was divided into aliquots (30 μl) that were stored at −75 °C. Further details regarding growth of the cells and purification of the receptor have been described previously (2.Wreggett K.A.

Modified apolipoprotein MSP1E3D1 (membrane scaffold protein 1E3D1) tagged with hexahistidine at the amino terminus was expressed in E. coli BL21Gold cells (Stratagene) and purified in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.01% NaN3 (29.Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. Directed self-assembly of monodisperse phospholipid bilayer Nanodiscs with controlled size.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The concentration of MSP1E3D1 in the purified preparation was 50 μm. To assemble receptor-containing nanodiscs, aliquots of MSP1E3D1 (250 μl) and buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 160 mm NaCl, and 0.8 mm EDTA, adjusted to pH 8.0 with KOH) (210 μl) were added to premixed samples of POPC (50 mm in 10 μl of 100 mm cholate) and purified M2 receptor (0.3 μm in 30 μl of buffer B). The concentrations after mixing were as follows: POPC, 1,000 μm; MSP1E3D1, 25 μm; M2 receptor, 0.018 μm. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, treated with BioBeads (SM2-adsorbent, Bio-Rad) (250 mg), and incubated for an additional 4 h at 4 °C. The BioBeads were removed on a 0.22-μm filter (Millex SLGP 033RS), and the nanodiscs were separated by fast protein liquid chromatography on a column of Superdex 200 (10/300 GL) (GE Healthcare) eluted with buffer C. A control lacking the receptor was prepared in the same manner. Total protein was monitored routinely in a flow cell by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The eluate was collected in fractions of 1 ml except when the receptor was to be monitored by means of N-[3H]methylscopolamine, when the volume of each fraction was 0.5 ml. The radioligand was present at the nearly saturating concentration of 33 nm, and nonspecific binding was taken as total binding in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled N-methylscopolamine. Most of the UV-absorbing material and essentially all of the receptor emerged in a single peak centered in each case at about 12 ml. The major peak was preceded in some cases by a smaller peak of aggregated MSP1E3D1, which emerged at the void volume and varied in size from preparation to preparation. The receptor-containing fractions were pooled and stored at −75 °C. The nominal ratio of receptors to nanodiscs was 1:690, based on the amounts added initially and assuming the incorporation of 2 eq of MSP1E3D1/nanodisc. One nanodisc is expected to take up 160–240 molecules of POPC (29.Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. Directed self-assembly of monodisperse phospholipid bilayer Nanodiscs with controlled size.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), but the amount of MSP1E3D1 was disproportionately higher in order to ensure the sequestration of all POPC and thereby to avoid the formation of larger lipid structures. The true ratio of receptors to nanodiscs, therefore, was less than the nominal value of 690. To reconstitute the receptor with holo-G proteins, an aliquot of G proteins in buffer A (3 μl) was added to receptor-containing nanodiscs (500 μl) prepared in buffer C and supplemented with DTT (1 mm) and MgCl2 (6 mm). The ratio of α-subunits to receptors was 80:1, and the final concentration of Lubrol-PX was 0.0006%. To measure the effect of Lubrol-PX alone, an aliquot of buffer A lacking G protein was concentrated 6-fold and mixed with the reconstituted receptor as described above. Reconstitutions were performed as described previously (7.Redka D.S. Heerklotz H. Wells J.W. Efficacy as an intrinsic property of the M2 muscarinic receptor in its tetrameric state.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 7405-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, POPC (1 mg), POPS (1 mg), and cholesterol (0.06 mg) were dissolved in chloroform and dried uniformly under argon to a thin film. The lipids then were hydrated for 1 h at 40 °C in 1 ml of buffer C, followed by three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing. When the receptor was to be reconstituted with G proteins, buffer C was supplemented throughout with DTT (1 mm) and MgCl2 (6 mm). Vesicles were prepared by extrusion through a polycarbonate membrane with 50-nm pores (Nuclepore Track-Etch Membrane, Whatman) mounted on an Avanti Mini-Extruder. The purified M2 receptor (3–4 pmol) in buffer B (30 μl) was mixed with carbachol (100 mm) in buffer C (5 μl) and an aliquot of buffer C alone (12 μl). The sample was kept for 10 min at 4 °C, mixed with an aliquot of G proteins in buffer A (3 μl, 80 α-subunits/receptor), and kept for an additional 5 min at 4 °C. When G proteins were omitted, the aliquot of buffer C alone was 15 μl, and the mixture was kept for 15 min at 4 °C. The final concentration of carbachol, therefore, was 10 mm in a total volume of 50 μl. The sample then was mixed with the preformed vesicles (150 μl) and applied to a column of Sephadex G-50 (0.8 × 5.0 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer C (6.Ma A.W.S. Redka D.S. Pisterzi L.F. Angers S.

Therefore, understanding the mechanism(s) by which angiogenesis occurs can have important therapeutic implications in numerous malignancies. We and others have demonstrated that low molecular weight hyaluronan (LMW-HA, ∼2500 Da) promotes endothelial cell (EC) barrier disruption and angiogenesis. However, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs is poorly defined. Our data indicate that treatment of human EC with LMW-HA induced CD44v10 association with the receptor-tyrosine kinase, EphA2, transactivation (tyrosine phosphorylation) of EphA2, and recruitment of the PDZ domain scaffolding protein, PATJ, to the cell periphery. Silencing (siRNA) CD44, EphA2, PATJ, or Dbs (RhoGEF) expression blocked LMW-HA-mediated angiogenesis (EC proliferation, migration, and tubule formation). In addition, silencing EphA2, PATJ, Src, or Dbs expression blocked LMW-HA-mediated RhoA activation. To translate our in vitro findings, we utilized a novel anginex/liposomal targeting of murine angiogenic endothelium with either CD44 or EphA2 siRNA and observed inhibition of LMW-HA-induced angiogenesis in implanted Matrigel plugs. Taken together, these results indicate LMW-HA-mediated transactivation of EphA2 is required for PATJ and Dbs membrane recruitment and subsequent RhoA activation required for angiogenesis. These results suggest that targeting downstream effectors of LMW-HA could be a useful therapeutic intervention for angiogenesis-associated diseases including tumor progression.

CD44, initially described as an adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte migration, has since emerged as an important family of adhesion receptors expressed on multiple cell types (1.Stamenkovic I.

A crucial role for CD44 in inflammation.Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 213-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the CD44 transcript can give rise to a number of CD44 variants that express an extra insert in their extracellular membrane proximal domain. CD44 has previously been reported to interact with a wide range of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules including cytoskeletal proteins (4.Morrison H. Sherman L.S. Legg J. Banine F. Isacke C.

HA is a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan with a molecular mass of up to 104 kDa and is made up of repeating disaccharide subunits of β-1,3-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine in linkage to β-1,4-d-glucuronic acid (11.Toole B.P. Hyaluronan: from extracellular glue to pericellular cue.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). HA is an abundant part of the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it is involved in a number of processes including organization of the ECM, tissue hydration, lubrication, and filtration. HA can also play a more active biological role and is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration by acting as a ligand for specific cell surface receptors including CD44, RHAMM, and LYVE-1 (12.Nandi A.

Increased HA concentrations are observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and/or plasma from patients with lung disorders such as acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.Dentener M.A. Vernooy J.H.

Increased HA content has been detected in the tumor microenvironment of most human malignancies and is associated with an aggressive phenotype and correlates with a poor clinical prognosis (18.Itano N.

The Eph family of receptor-tyrosine kinases (the largest subfamily of tyrosine kinases) and their ligands, the ephrins, have emerged as important regulators of endothelial cell function, particularly during angiogenesis and in barrier function (20.Brantley-Sieders D.M. Fang W.B. Hwang Y. Hicks D. Chen J.

The EphA2 receptor and ephrinA1 ligand in solid tumors: function and therapeutic targeting.Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 1795-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The Eph receptor family is subdivided into two classes based on homology and ligand binding. EphA receptors bind mainly to ephrin-A ligands, which are associated with the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, whereas EphB receptors bind ephrin-B ligands, which are transmembrane proteins. The intracellular domain of the Eph receptors contains two autophosphorylation sites and the kinase domain along with a sterile alpha motif and PDZ domain-binding motif which can serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules (23.Wykosky J. Debinski W. The EphA2 receptor and ephrinA1 ligand in solid tumors: function and therapeutic targeting.Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 1795-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Another important aspect of the Eph-Ephrin interaction is bidirectional signaling. Although activation of the kinase domain within the Eph receptor facilitates “forward” signaling, “reverse” signaling may also be initiated via the membrane-bound ephrin ligands (22.Pasquale E.B. Eph-ephrin bidirectional signaling in physiology and disease.Cell. 2008; 133: 38-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Binding of ephrin-A1 by the EphA2 receptor leads to trans/autophosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domains, although it may also act as a substrate for Src family kinases (24.Pasquale E.B. Eph receptor signalling casts a wide net on cell behaviour.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). These phosphorylated sites then act as binding sites for downstream signaling molecules including Vav2/3, Shc, Cbl, and SHP-2. The EphA2 receptor and its ligand ephrin-A1 have recently gained further attention as their role in regulating angiogenesis and endothelial barrier function, promoting tumor metastasis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors has emerged (25.Gusenbauer S. Vlaicu P. Ullrich A. HGF induces novel EGFR functions involved in resistance formation to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 3846-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). EphA2 receptor activation by ephrin-A1 increases endothelial permeability in cultured pulmonary aortic endothelial cells as measured using transendothelial electrical resistance (21.Larson J. Schomberg S. Schroeder W. Carpenter T.C. Endothelial EphA receptor stimulation increases lung vascular permeability.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2008; 295: L431-L439Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). EphA2 activation can lead to an increase in active RhoA, resulting in the destabilization of adherens and tight junctions and a decrease in VE-cadherin localization at endothelial cell-cell contacts. Ephrin-A1 treatment also leads to disrupted epithelial cell-cell contacts (26.Fang W.B. Ireton R.C. Zhuang G. Takahashi T. Reynolds A. Chen J.

In the current study we investigated the mechanism of LMW-HA-mediated human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell angiogenesis. We have identified a novel Src-mediated transactivation of the EphA2 receptor that occurs upon LMW-HA binding to the CD44 variant, CD44v10. Furthermore, we demonstrated the involvement of the PATJ (Pals-1-associated tight junction protein) scaffolding protein and its role in recruiting specific RhoGEFs in response to LMW-HA or ephrin-A1 activation of CD44 or EphA2, respectively. These events culminated in RhoA activation, a crucial step in LMW-HA-mediated angiogenesis. Our findings demonstrate a critical interaction between two key signaling pathways regulating endothelial function. This insight may identify novel targets in the treatment of numerous angiogenesis-related pathologies. Antibodies utilized in this study include anti-EphA2, Dbs, LARG, RhoGEF p115, Syx (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-EphA2Tyr594 (Cell Applications), anti-CD44 (IM7 clone) (BD Biosciences), anti-CD44v10 (Novus Biologicals), anti-PATJ (GeneTex Inc), anti-EphA2, anti-Src (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-Src (Novus Biologicals), and anti-actin (Sigma). Recombinant ephrin-A1-Fc protein was purchased from R&D Systems. Hyaluronic acid (sodium salt from Streptococcus zooepidemicus) was purchased from Sigma. Anginex was purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). Reagents for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad, and Immobilon-P transfer membrane was purchased from Millipore (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). LMW-HA was prepared similar to that as previously described (8.Singleton P.A. Dudek S.M. Ma S.F. Garcia J.G. Transactivation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors is essential for vascular barrier regulation. Novel role for hyaluronan and CD44 receptor family.J. Biol.

Briefly 500 mg of hyaluronan sodium salt from S. zooepidemicus was digested with 20,000 units of bovine testicular hyaluronidase (Type VI-S, lyophilized powder, 3,000–15,000 units/mg (Sigma, H3631) in digestion buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.4, 0.15 m NaCl) for 24 h, and the reaction was stopped with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The resulting solution was centrifuged in an Ultrafree-MCTM Millipore 5-kDa molecular mass cutoff filter, and the flow-through was dialyzed against distilled water for 24 h at 4 °C in 500-Da cutoff Spectra-Por tubing (Pierce-Warriner, Chester, UK). LMW-HA was quantitated using an ELISA-like competitive binding assay with a known amount of fixed HA and biotinylated HA-binding peptide as the indicator (Echelon Inc). LMW-HA solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm filters and kept in sterile tubes. In some cases both low and high molecular weight HAs were subject to boiling, proteinase K (50 μg/ml) digestion, hyaluronidase SD digestion (Streptococcus dysgalactiae, NorthStar Bioproducts Associates of Cape Cod Inc., East Falmouth, MA (100741-1A), 100 milliunits/ml utilized), or the addition of boiled (inactivated) hyaluronidase SD to test for possible protein/lipid contaminants (35.Calabro A.

Adaptation of FACE methodology for microanalysis of total hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate composition from cartilage.Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To test for endotoxin contamination of HA, a lipopolysaccharides (LPS) bioAssay ELISA kit (USBiological Life Sciences) was used. LMW-HA with HA standards (Sigma and Enzo Life Sciences) was run on 4–20% Tris borate-EDTA gels and stained with Stains-All (Sigma) to confirm LMW-HA purity and size. Primary human pulmonary microvascular cells were purchased from Lonza and maintained in EBM-2 growth media supplemented with EGM-2-MV Bulletkit and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and used for experimentation at passages 3–6. Human lung microvascular EC were transfected with siRNA against specific mRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using siPORTamineTM as the transfection reagent (Ambion) according to the protocol provided by Ambion. Cells (∼40% confluent) were serum-starved for 1 h followed by incubated with 250 nm concentrations of target siRNA (or scramble siRNA or no siRNA) for 6 h in serum-free media. The serum-containing media was then added (10% serum final concentration) for 42 h before biochemical experiments, and/or functional assays were conducted. Effective silencing of target protein expression was determined with immunoblot analysis of siRNA-transfected EC lysates using specific antibodies. Cellular materials from treated or untreated HPMVEC were incubated with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm NaF, 50 μm okadaic acid, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 1:250 dilution of Calbiochem protease inhibitor mixture 3). The samples were then immunoprecipitated with either anti-EphA2 or anti-PATJ IgG followed by SDS-PAGE in 4–15% polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto ImmobilonTM membranes, and developed with specific primary and secondary antibodies. Visualization of immunoreactive bands was achieved using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). In some instances computer-assisted densitometry was used to quantitate immunoreactive bands. Measurement of in vitro EC growth was performed as we have previously described (36.Lennon F.E. Mirzapoiazova T. Mambetsariev B. Poroyko V.A. Salgia R. Moss J. Singleton P.A. The μ-opioid receptor promotes opioid and growth factor-induced proliferation, migration, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human lung cancer.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e91577Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Control, VEGF (200 pg/ml) or LMW-HA (0.1–1000 nm)-pretreated EC (5 × 103 cells/well) were incubated with 0.2 ml of serum-free media for 72 h at 37 °C in 5%CO2, 95% air in 96-well culture plates. The in vitro cell proliferation assay was analyzed by measuring increases in cell number using the CellTiter96TM MTS assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and read at 492 nm. Each assay was set up in triplicate and repeated at least five times. After agonist and/or inhibitor treatment, ECs are solubilized in solubilization buffer and incubated with Rho-bonding domain-conjugated beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the Rho-bonding domain beads with the GTP-bound form of RhoA bound were washed extensively. The Rho-bonding domain beads were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the bound RhoA material was run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to ImmobilonTM, and immunoblotted with anti-RhoA antibody. The tubule formation assay was adapted from the method described here (37.Arnaoutova I. George J. Kleinman H.K. Benton G. The endothelial cell tube formation assay on basement membrane turns 20: state of the science and the art.Angiogenesis. 2009; 12: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Briefly Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was mixed with 2% serum EBM-2 media in a 1:1 ratio, used to coat 12 well plates (500 μl per well), and allowed to polymerize at 37 °C for 30 min. Control or silenced endothelial cells were then seeded into each well (5000 cells/cm2) in 2% serum EBM-2. LMW-HA (100 nm) or an equivalent volume of PBS was then added to the appropriate wells. Cells were then incubated for 6 h to allow for tubule formation. Tubule formation was then recorded. 10 images were recorded per well, and ImageJ was used to measure total tubule length per image. Each treatment was performed in triplicate, and experiments were repeated three times. Results are expressed as tubule length per treatment. Transwell filters (8-μm pore size) were purchased from Corning Costar. Control or silenced endothelial cells were plated in triplicate in the upper chamber of the transwell filter in serum-free media, and serum-free media with LMW-HA (100 nm) was added to the lower well. Cells were incubated and allowed to migrate for 24 h. For the inhibitor studies cells were pretreated for 1 h before seeding on the transwell filter. Cell migration was then quantified by counting the number of cells that had migrated to the bottom well and expressing as a percentage of the total number of cells initially plated. Animal protocols were approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and all animals were cared for according to the national Institute of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Matrigel was purchased from BD Biosciences. Briefly, C57BL/6J mice were lightly anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg) and were injected subcutaneously with 500 μl of Matrigel, which was premixed with vehicle or LMW-HA. The injections were made rapidly with a 30-gauge 1/2-inch needle to ensure the entire content was delivered as a single plug. The mice were allowed to recover, and 7 days later the silencing RNA complexes were delivered via liposome injection. Liposomes were prepared as we have previously described (38.Singleton P.A. Mirzapoiazova T. Guo Y. Sammani S. Mambetsariev N. Lennon F.E. Moreno-Vinasco L. Garcia J.G. High molecular weight hyaluronan is a novel inhibitor of pulmonary vascular leakiness.Am. J. Physiol.

The solvent was evaporated in a water bath set at 50 °C under nitrogen. The resulting dry lipid film was immediately suspended in 100 μl of PBS (pH 7.4, final concentration 20 mg/ml). The cationic lipid dispersion was combined with no siRNA (control), siSTABLE CD44, EphA2, or control siRNA (ThermoScientific Dharmacon), or pCMV6 empty vector or GFP-expression vector (pCMV6-A-GFP Vector, Origene, Rockville, MD) (1 μg per 10 μg lipid) in a glass container. The liposome-siRNA mixture was sonicated in a water bath sonicator (Fisher) to clarity. For the anginex peptide (39.Brandwijk R.J. Mulder W.J. Nicolay K. Mayo K.H. Thijssen V.L. Griffioen A.W.

The solution was then filtered with a 5-kDa filter (Ultrafree-MC) and adjusted to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The modified peptide was cross-linked to liposomes containing siRNAs or expression vectors by covalent linking of the carboxyl groups on the anginex peptide with the amine groups on liposomes using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloric acid reagent (Pierce). Labeled liposomes were purified by dialysis in a Slide-A-Lyzer (20-kDa cutoff; Pierce) against a 1000-fold excess volume of sterile PBS, pH 7.4, overnight. Sterile anginex-conjugated liposomes containing no siRNA (control), CD44, EphA2, or control siRNA (100 μl) or pCMV6 empty vector or GFP expression vector (pCMV6-A-GFP Vector, Origene) were injected into the internal jugular vein of C57B6/6J mice. Animals were treated for 7 days with siRNA (10 mg/kg). The animals were then sacrificed, and the Matrigel plugs were harvested and fixed in 10% buffered formalin PBS solution. Matrigel plugs were then either: 1) depolymerized by a BD Cell Recovery Solution (BD Biosciences) and each plug dissolved in 300 μl of recovery solution as described in manufacturer's protocol, run on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for specific proteins; 2) placed in OCT embedding medium, cut in 12-μm-thick sections and processed for GFP staining with anti-turboGFP antibody (OriGene); Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were then used to visualize GFP staining. Nuclear staining was performed with DAPI; or 3) processed for Masson's Trichrome histological staining to identify invaded cells. The prepared slides were then scanned using a Pannoramic Scan (3DHistech) whole slide scanner. Ten fields of view were selected per slide, and the number of cells per field was counted using ImageJ. These experiments were repeated three times with five animals per treatment group. Results are expressed as the number of cells/plug. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. For data analysis, experimental samples were compared with controls by unpaired Student's t test. For multiple-group comparisons, a one-way variance analysis and post hoc multiple comparisons tests were used. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant when the p value was less than 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software Inc.). Previous reports have described the angiogenic effects of various sizes of LMW-HA in numerous angiogenesis models (13.Cuff C.A. Kothapalli D. Azonobi I. Chun S. Zh"
https://openalex.org/W2002345777,"Background A large literature has indicated a robust association between birth spacing and child survival, but evidence on the association of birth timing with physical growth in low and middle income countries (LMICs) remains limited. Methods and Results Data from 153 cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) across 61 LMICs conducted between 1990 and 2011 were combined to assess the association of birth timing with child stunting (height-for-age z-score <−2). A total of 623,789 children of birth order 1–5 contributed to the maternal age analysis, while the birth spacing dataset consisted of 584,226 children of birth order 2 and higher. Compared to 27–34 year old mothers, maternal age under 18 years was associated with a relative stunting risk of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.29–1.40) for firstborn children, whereas the relative risk was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.19–1.29) for mothers aged 18–19 years. The association of young maternal age with stunting was significantly greater for urban residents and those in the top 50% of household wealth. Birth intervals less than 12 months and 12–23 months had relative risks for stunting of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06–1.12) and 1.06 (95% CI: 1.05–1.06) as compared to a 24–35 month inter-pregnancy interval, respectively. The strength of both teenage pregnancy and short birth interval associations showed substantial variation across WHO region. We estimate that 8.6% (6.9–10.3%) of stunted cases in the South Asian DHS sample would have been averted by jointly eliminating teen pregnancies and birth intervals less than 24 months, while only 3.6% (1.5–5.7%) of stunting cases would have prevented in the Middle East and North Africa sample. Conclusions Postponing the age of first birth and increasing inter-pregnancy intervals has the potential to significantly reduce the prevalence of stunting and improve child development in LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W2080981603,"Understanding the population structure of species that disperse primarily by human transport is essential to predicting and controlling human-mediated spread of invasive species. The German cockroach (Blattella germanica) is a widespread urban invader that can actively disperse within buildings but is spread solely by human-mediated dispersal over longer distances; however, its population structure is poorly understood. Using microsatellite markers we investigated population structure at several spatial scales, from populations within single apartment buildings to populations from several cities across the U.S. and Eurasia. Both traditional measures of genetic differentiation and Bayesian clustering methods revealed increasing levels of genetic differentiation at greater geographic scales. Our results are consistent with active dispersal of cockroaches largely limited to movement within a building. Their low levels of genetic differentiation, yet limited active spread between buildings, suggests a greater likelihood of human-mediated dispersal at more local scales (within a city) than at larger spatial scales (within and between continents). About half the populations from across the U.S. clustered together with other U.S. populations, and isolation by distance was evident across the U.S. Levels of genetic differentiation among Eurasian cities were greater than those in the U.S. and greater than those between the U.S. and Eurasia, but no clear pattern of structure at the continent level was detected. MtDNA sequence variation was low and failed to reveal any geographical structure. The weak genetic structure detected here is likely due to a combination of historical admixture among populations and periodic population bottlenecks and founder events, but more extensive studies are needed to determine whether signatures of global movement may be present in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2051454328,"Interphase chromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are tethered to the nuclear envelope at their telomeres and to the spindle pole body (SPB) at their centromeres. Using a polymer model of yeast chromosomes that includes these interactions, we show theoretically that telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope is a major determinant of gene positioning within the nucleus only for genes within 10 kb of the telomeres. We test this prediction by measuring the distance between the SPB and the silent mating locus (HML) on chromosome III in wild–type and mutant yeast strains that contain altered chromosome-tethering interactions. In wild-type yeast cells we find that disruption of the telomere tether does not dramatically change the position of HML with respect to the SPB, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Alternatively, using a mutant strain with a synthetic tether that localizes an HML-proximal site to the nuclear envelope, we find a significant change in the SPB-HML distance, again as predicted by theory. Our study quantifies the importance of tethering at telomeres on the organization of interphase chromosomes in yeast, which has been shown to play a significant role in determining chromosome function such as gene expression and recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2047918247,"The present study examined to examine whether improvement of insomnia is mediated by a reduction in sleep-related dysfunctional beliefs through cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. In total, 64 patients with chronic insomnia received cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia consisting of 6 biweekly individual treatment sessions of 50 minutes in length. Participants were asked to complete the Athens Insomnia Scale and the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep scale both at the baseline and at the end of treatment. The results showed that although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia greatly reduced individuals’ scores on both scales, the decrease in dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep with treatment did not seem to mediate improvement in insomnia. The findings suggest that sleep-related dysfunctional beliefs endorsed by patients with chronic insomnia may be attenuated by cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, but changes in such beliefs are not likely to play a crucial role in reducing the severity of insomnia."
https://openalex.org/W2058664408,"The Sumatran orangutan is currently listed by the IUCN as critically endangered and the Bornean species as endangered. Unless effective conservation measures are enacted quickly, most orangutan populations without adequate protection face a dire future. Two main strategies are being pursued to conserve orangutans: (i) rehabilitation and reintroduction of ex-captive or displaced individuals; and (ii) protection of their forest habitat to abate threats like deforestation and hunting. These strategies are often mirrored in similar programs to save other valued and endangered mega-fauna. Through GIS analysis, collating data from across the literature, and combining this information within a modelling and decision analysis framework, we analysed which strategy or combination of strategies is the most cost-effective at maintaining wild orangutan populations, and under what conditions. We discovered that neither strategy was optimal under all circumstances but was dependent on the relative cost per orangutan, the timescale of management concern, and the rate of deforestation. Reintroduction, which costs twelve times as much per animal as compared to protection of forest, was only a cost-effective strategy at very short timescales. For time scales longer than 10–20 years, forest protection is the more cost-efficient strategy for maintaining wild orangutan populations. Our analyses showed that a third, rarely utilised strategy is intermediate: introducing sustainable logging practices and protection from hunting in timber production forest. Maximum long-term cost-efficiency is achieved by working in conservation forest. However, habitat protection involves addressing complex conservation issues and conflicting needs at the landscape level. We find a potential resolution in that well-managed production forests could achieve intermediate conservation outcomes. This has broad implications for sustaining biodiversity more generally within an economically productive landscape. Insights from this analysis should provide a better framework to prioritize financial investments, and facilitate improved integration between the organizations that implement these strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2032214143,"Variation in age and size of mature nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) within and among 16 Fennoscandian populations were assessed using skeletochronology. The average age of individuals in a given population varied from 1.7 to 4.7 years. Fish from pond populations were on average older than those from lake and marine populations, and females tended to be older than males. Reproduction in marine and lake populations commenced typically at an age of two years, whereas that in ponds at an age of three years. The maximum life span of the fish varied from 3 to 7 years. Mean body size within and among populations increased with increasing age, but the habitat and population differences in body size persisted even after accounting for variation in population age (and sex) structure. Hence, the population differences in mean body size are not explainable by age differences alone. As such, much of the pronounced intraspecific variation in population age structure can be attributed to delayed maturation and extended longevity of the pond fish. The results are contrasted and discussed in the context of similar data from the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) occupying the same geographic area."
https://openalex.org/W2078650862,"AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) play a critical role in mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. Alterations in receptor expression, distribution, and trafficking have been shown to underlie synaptic plasticity and higher brain functions, including learning and memory, as well as brain dysfunctions such as drug addiction and psychological disorders. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate AMPAR dynamics. We have shown previously that mammalian AMPARs are subject to posttranslational modification by ubiquitin, with AMPAR ubiquitination enhancing receptor internalization and reducing AMPAR cell surface expression. Here we report a crucial role for epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 (Eps15), an endocytic adaptor, in ubiquitination-dependent AMPAR internalization. We find that suppression or overexpression of Eps15 results in changes in AMPAR surface expression. Eps15 interacts with AMPARs, which requires Nedd4-mediated GluA1 ubiquitination and the ubiquitin-interacting motif of Eps15. Importantly, we find that Eps15 plays an important role in AMPAR internalization. Knockdown of Eps15 suppresses the internalization of GluA1 but not the mutant GluA1 that lacks ubiquitination sites, indicating a role of Eps15 for the internalization of ubiquitinated AMPARs.

https://openalex.org/W2087276118,"Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values calculated through magnetic resonance imaging have been proposed as a useful tool to distinguish benign from malignant liver lesions. Most studies however included simple cysts in their analysis. Liver cysts are easy to diagnose, have very high ADC values and their inclusion facilitates differentiation in the ADC values between benign and malignant liver lesions groups. We prospectively evaluated the ability of ADC values to differentiate metastatic liver lesions from all benign or only solid benign liver lesions.Sixty-seven adult cancer patients with 188 liver lesions were evaluated. Lesions were categorized as metastatic or benign throughout imaging and clinical evaluation. One hundred and five (105) metastatic lesions and 83 benign lesions including hemangiomas (37), cysts (42), adenomas (2) and focal nodular hyperplasias (2) were evaluated. ADC values were calculated for each lesion utilizing two b values (0 and 600 sec/mm2).The average ADC value for cysts was 2.4×10(-3) mm2/sec (CI: 2.1-2.6), for solid benign lesions was 1.4×10(-3) mm2/sec (CI: 1.1-1.7) and for metastases was 1.0×10(-3) mm2/sec (CI: 0.8-1.3). There was a difference between the ADC values of metastases and benign solid lesions (p<0.0001). With the ADC value of 1.5×10(-3) mm2/sec as a cut off it is possible to distinguish metastatic from benign liver lesions, including cysts, with an accuracy of 78%. But to distinguish metastatic from benign solid liver lesions the best ADC cut off value was 1.2×10(-3) mm2/sec and the accuracy drops to 71%.ADC values proved to be helpful in the distinction between metastasis and benign solid hepatic lesions. But the exclusion of cysts in the analysis point out to a lower cut off value and lower accuracy than previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W1978462623,"Bone remodeling is a continuous process of osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption to maintain normal bone mass. NFATc1 is the master regulator of osteoclastogensis and transcriptionally activated by c-Fos and NF-κB in response to receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) treatment. Defective entry into mitosis 1 (Dim1) is a nuclear protein that is implicated in pre-mRNA splicing and cell cycle progression, but the possible role of Dim1 in regulating other cellular processes remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Dim1 attenuates RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by targeting NFATc1 signaling pathway. Expression levels of Dim1 and NFATc1 are significantly increased during the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dim1 markedly enhances the expression of NFATc1 and its target genes, leading to the increase of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Conversely, ectopic expression of Dim1 decreases RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation by silencing NFATc1 and its target genes, further linking Dim1 to the dynamic regulation of osteoclastogenesis. Consistent with this notion, ChIP and interaction studies show that Dim1 directly associates with c-Fos and prevents c-Fos from binding to the NFATc1 promoter, resulting in targeted inactivation of the NFATc1 gene. Therefore, our studies reveal an unrecognized role for Dim1 as a master modulator of osteoclast differentiation, as well as the molecular mechanism underlying its repressive action toward osteoclastogensis.

Dim1 is a small protein with the molecular mass of 15 kDa and was initially identified in fission yeast as an essential protein for cell cycle regulation as well as for chromosome segregation during mitosis (20.Berry L.D.

Dim1 is extraordinarily well conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom and is present in numerous species including mammals, plants, and yeasts, with ∼80% sequence identity throughout the entire length of 142 amino acids (21.Reuter K.

Dim1 has been reported to interact with components of pre-mRNA splicing machinery such hnRNP-F, hnRNP-H, and the RNA-binding protein Npw38/PQBP-1 (23.Zhang Y. Lindblom T. Chang A. Sudol M.

Under some circumstances, Dim1 has effects on cell cycle progression via its role in the control of pre-mRNA splicing of proteins responsible for accurate cell cycle progression. The three-dimensional structure of Dim1p has been determined by both nuclear magnetic resonance (21.Reuter K. Nottrott S. Fabrizio P. Lührmann R. Ficner R.

Biochemical characterization and crystal structure of a Dim1 family-associated protein: Dim2.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11997-12008Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The results indicate that Dim1 contains a common thioredoxin-like fold characterized by a four-stranded β-sheet comprising pairs of parallel and antiparallel strands flanked by three α-helices with a C-terminal extension. In addition to its function as a cell cycle regulator, Dim1 seems to participate in regulating other cellular reactions, such as host-virus interaction and viral replication, although the details remain largely unknown at present (25.Mehrabadi M. Hussain M. Asgari S. Cloning and characterization of a Dim1-like mitosis gene of Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) induced by Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus.J. Invertebr. Pathol. 2013; 113: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Dim1 functions as a negative regulator of RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. Specifically, Dim1 directly interacts with c-Fos and suppresses c-Fos transcriptional activity toward the NFATc1 gene, thereby diminishing the expression of NFATc1 target genes and inhibiting RANKL-induced osteoclatogenesis. Consistent with these results, Dim1-deficient osteoclast precursors exhibit increased expression of NFATc1 target genes and show up-regulation of RANKL-mediated induction of osteoclast differentiation. Our studies uncover a novel role for Dim1 in regulating RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and may provide the basis for novel therapeutic approaches to various types of bone diseases. For mammalian expression of Dim1, FLAG-Dim1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted into of retroviral expression vector pMX. To generate GST-Dim1, Dim1 cDNA was ligated into pGEX4T-1 vector. Antibodies for c-Fos, Dim1, HA, NFATc1, and NF-κB p65 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; antibodies for actin and FLAG were from Sigma; antibody for Mitf was from Active Motif. Bone marrow (BM) cells were collected by flushing femurs and tibias from 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice. Cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and M-CSF (5 ng/ml) for 16 h. Non-adherent cells were harvested and cultured with M-CSF (30 ng/ml) for 3 days. Floating cells were removed and adherent cells were used as bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) cells. To generate osteoclasts, BMMs were cultured in the presence of M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and RANKL (50 ng/ml). On day 3, the cells were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using the acid phosphatase, leukocyte kit (Sigma). TRAP-positive multinucleated cells containing three or more nuclei are counted as osteoclasts under a light microscope. For in vitro pulldown assays, whole cell lysates from 293T cells expressing Mitf, c-Fos, and NF-κB p65 were incubated with GST-Dim1 (2 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in 750 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing beads three times with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting. For in vivo interaction studies, RAW 264.7 cells were stably infected with retroviral vectors encoding FLAG-Dim1. Cell lysates were subjected to anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation, and the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. For shRNA-based knockdown, DNA oligonucleotides encoding shRNA specific for Dim1 mRNA (5′- CAAGCAAGAAATGGTTGACAT-3′) were annealed and ligated into the lentiviral expression vector pLKO.1 (Addgene). Lentivirus particles were generated in 293T cells by co-transfecting plasmids encoding VSV-G, NL-BH, and the shRNA. For Dim1 knockdown, BMM cells were infected with these viruses and selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml) for 3 days. After selection, BMM cells were cultured for additional 3 days in the presence of M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and RANKL (50 ng/ml). To generate retroviral particles, pMX-FLAG-Dim1 was transfected into the packaging cell line Plat-E. Viral soup was collected from cultured media 2 days after transfection. BMM cells were infected with viral soup and selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml) for 3 days. After selection, cells were cultured with M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and RANKL (50 ng/ml) for 3 days. Cell proliferation was assessed by the 3–4,5-(dimethyl-thyazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay. In brief, BMM cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 104 and treated with the MTT labeling reagent (0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. The blue MTT formazan precipitate was dissolved with the MTT solvent (0.2 ml) and measured at a wavelength of 570 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). RAW 264.7 cells were plated in 12-well plates at 50% confluence and transfected with reporter plasmids and expression vectors for c-Fos, NF-κB p65, and/or Dim1 in the presence or absence of RANKL (30 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cells were lysed in Reporter Lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase activity using Plate Chameleon (Hidex). BMM cells were treated with M-CSF and RANKL for 0 and 3 days. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by gene expression microarray using the MouseRef-8 Expression BeadChip (version 2.0). Differential gene expression analysis was carried out using the ArrayPipe software. Genes that are up-regulated with RANKL treatment in BMM cells were functionally analyzed in the context of gene ontology and molecular networks by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. For quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated as for microarray and subjected to RT reactions (26.Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H.

The following primers were used for qRT-PCR to quantify target gene expression: β-actin (5′-GCAAGTGCTTCTAGGCGGAC-3′ and 5′-AAGAAAGGGTGTAAAACGCAGC-3′), c-fos (5′-CCAGTCAAGAGCATCAGCAA-3′ and 5′-AAGTAGTGCAGCCCGGAGTA-3′), Ctsk (5′-ACGGAGGCATTGACTCTGAAGATG-3′ and 5′-GGAAGCACCAACGAGAGGAGAAAT-3′), Dim1 (5′-CATCGCCGAAAAGGTTAAAA-3′ and 5′-GGCCCAGTTGATCTTGTTGT-3′), integrin-β3 (5′-GAATGAATGCGCAGCACAGAGC-3′ and 5′-ACAGAGACTGGACCGAAACCAC-3′), Nfatc1 (5′-CTCGAAAGACAGCACTGGAGCAT-3′ and 5′-CGGCTGCCTTCCGTCTCATAG-3′), OSCAR (5′-CTGCTGGTAACGGATCAGCTCCCCAGA-3′ and 5′-CCAAGGAGCCAGAACCTTCGAAACT-3′), NF-κB p65 (5′-GGAGTTCCAGTACTTGCC-3′ and 5′-GTCCTTTTGCGCTTCTCT-3′), and GAPDH (5′-GGTCCTCAGTGTAGCCCAAG-3′ and 5′-AATGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCT-3′). Mock-depleted or Dim1-depleted BMM cells, either treated or not treated with RANKL, were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and processed for ChIP. All samples were run in triplicate, and results were averaged. Sequences of the primers used for quantitative real time PCR are as follows: AP-1 binding site (5′-CCGGGACGCCCATGCAATCTGTTAGTAATT-3′ and 5′-GCGGGTGCCCTGAGAAAGCTACTCTCCCTT-3′) and distal region (5′-TCTGAGAGGGAGTGGCTGAT-3′ and 5′-CCTGGCTGGTTTGAGTTGAT-3′). The NCBI GEO accession number for microarray data reported in this paper is GSE57468. Osteoclastogenesis is a complex process that reflects numerous changes in gene expression and cellular pathways. We used BMM cells to study the global transcription network during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Our initial TRAP staining confirmed that a significant number of multinucleated osteoclast-like cells were formed from BMM cells when cultured in the presence of soluble RANKL (Fig. 1A). To screen for altered gene expression during osteoclastogenesis, RANKL-treated BMM cells were subjected to gene expression profiling using the MouseRef-8 Expression microarrays (version 2.0). With a fold-change cutoff of >2.0, the expression profiling showed that 1073 genes were activated and 1070 genes were repressed (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table S1) in RANKL-treated cells compared with the untreated cells. Many of the genes up-regulated upon RANKL treatment are known to be involved in osteoclastogenic signaling events and osteoclast function (supplemental Table S2). Furthermore, our data showed that a group of genes including NFATc1 and its target genes that are essential for bone remodeling were differentially expressed in the RANKL-treated cells (supplemental Table S1). Unexpectedly, our profiling data also indicated that Dim1 expression was up-regulated in RANKL-treated cells relative to its untreated controls (Table S1). Although Dim1 has been mainly characterized as an essential factor in the control of pre-RNA splicing in human cells, these results suggest that Dim1 may play a role in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. To explore this possibility and validate the microarray data, we analyzed the expression of Dim1, NFATc1, and NFATc1 target genes, which showed the consistent response to RANKL treatment in the gene expression data, by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1C). The results correlated well with those obtained from the gene expression microarrays and demonstrated that RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis is linked to transcriptional activation of these genes over a period of 3 days. In determining the protein levels of Dim1 and NFATc1 by immunoblot, we again found that RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis is associated with the up-regulation of Dim1 and NFATc1 expression (Fig. 1D). One of the key observations made in our gene expression profiling is that high-level expression of Dim1 coincides with transcriptional activation of NFATc1 and its target genes, which are critical for RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. To assess whether Dim1 directly influences osteoclastogenesis, we first depleted Dim1 in BMM cells and checked its effects on osteoclastic cell growth and the NFATc1 transcription pathway. Immunoblotting confirmed that infection of BMM cells with lentivirus expressing Dim1 shRNA efficiently silenced Dim1 expression (Fig. 2A). Because osteoclastogenesis enhances the expression of Dim1, we expected that Dim1 knockdown would negatively affect NFATc1 transactivation and thus RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Contrary to these expectations, we found that osteoclast development was significantly accelerated in Dim1-depleted BMM cells in the presence of RANKL (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the finding that the proliferation of osteoclast precursors was not affected by Dim1 knockdown suggests that Dim1 inhibits the differentiation, not the proliferation, of pre-osteoclasts (Fig. 2C). We next determined whether Dim1 would participate in regulating the expression of NFATc1 and its target genes in the context of RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the results of osteoclastogenesis assays in Fig. 2B, knockdown of Dim1 resulted in higher expression of NFATc1 over 3 days of RANKL treatment (Fig. 2D, NFATc1). Further analyses revealed a similar increase in the expression of the four NFATc1 target genes, which were identified from our gene expression profiling, in Dim1-depleted BMM cells during osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 2D). In consonance with our observations from knockdown experiments, ectopic expression of Dim1 suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in BMM cells by ∼20%, but did not affect the proliferation of BMM cells (Fig. 3, A–C). Expression of NFATc1 was also repressed by Dim1 expression, and the observed repression was paralleled by inactivation of the four NFATc1 target genes (Fig. 3D). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that Dim1-mediated suppression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis involves transcriptional alterations of NFATc1 and its target genes. RANKL-induced transcriptional activation of the Nfatc1 gene during osteoclastogenesis is dependent on both c-Fos and NF-κB pathways (26.Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H.

Previous studies identified several factors negatively regulating RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by interfering with the DNA-binding activities of c-Fos and NF-κB, thereby reducing the expression of NFATc1 (31.Kim K.

Negative regulation of osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by cytokines and transcriptional repressors.Arthritis Res. Ther. 2011; 13: 234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Considering the transrepression activities of Dim1 toward NFATc1 expression, we were interested in investigating whether the observed function of Dim1 in attenuating osteoclastogenesis is the consequence of inhibiting the expression of these upstream signaling components. Therefore, we examined the relative levels of c-Fos and NF-κB p65 subunit in control and Dim1-depleted osteoclastic cells by qRT-PCR. Knocking down Dim1 led to a distinct increase in NFATc1 transcription during osteoclast formation (Fig. 4A, NFATc1), but transcription of c-Fos and NF-κB p65 was only weakly affected by Dim1 knockdown (c-fos and p65). Similarly, we did not see any obvious antagonistic regulation of c-fos and NF-κB p65 genes by Dim1 expression during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 4B). Consistent with these results, reporter gene assays showed that Dim1 selectively suppresses NFATc1 transcription without affecting the transcription of c-Fos and NF-κB p65 (Fig. 4C). This observation strongly suggests that it is the function of c-Fos/NF-κB, not their expression, which is disrupted by Dim1 for NFATc1 suppression. To check this possibility, we first sought to determine whether the impact of Dim1 on NFATc1 expression is due to its direct interaction with c-Fos and/or NF-κB. GST-fused Dim1 was immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with cell lysates of 293T cells expressing Mitf, c-Fos, or NF-κB p65. The same binding assays were performed with GST control. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, c-Fos efficiently interacted with Dim1, but Mitf and NF-κB p65 showed no detectable binding to Dim1. The observed interaction between Dim1 and c-Fos appears to be specific as GST alone showed no interaction with c-Fos. To further validate these in vitro binding results, extracts from RAW 264.7 cells infected with virus expressing FLAG-Dim1 were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody. Consistent with the in vitro data, ectopic Dim1 was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous c-Fos, but failed to show any coprecipitation of Mitf and NF-κB p65 (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5.Blocking c-Fos recruitment to NFATc1 promoter by Dim1. A, FLAG-Mitf, FLAG-c-Fos, or HA-NF-κB p65 expression vectors were transfected into 293T cells. 2 days after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and incubated with GST or GST-Dim1 immobilized on glutathione beads. Bound proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody. Results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.

The expression of the reporter gene bearing c-Fos binding sites was highly activated by transient expression of c-Fos. Because co-expression of Dim1 generated a substantial inactivation of c-Fos-mediated reporter gene transcription (Fig. 5C), our findings suggest that the repressive function of Dim1 is highly dependent on c-Fos. To gain further insight into the mechanism by which Dim1 modulates the expression of Nfatc1 gene, ChIP assays were performed in control and Dim1-depleted cells using c-Fos antibody. In control cells, a distinct localization of c-Fos at the proximal promoter of Nfatc1 gene was detected in response to RANKL stimulation (Fig. 5D). However, a clear increase in c-Fos occupancy was observed at the promoter region upon knocking down Dim1 by shRNA. Taken together, these findings support the view that Dim1 suppresses Nfatc1 gene transcription by affecting the recruitment of c-Fos to NFATc1 promoter, rather than affecting the expression of c-Fos, during osteoclastogenesis. In the present study, we focused on potential roles of Dim1 in regulating the initial stage of the differentiation process in which quiescent osteoclast precursors are induced to become osteoclasts by RANKL stimulation. Our study indicates that Dim1 plays a critical role in controlling the expression of NFATc1, a pivotal component for osteoclast development, in osteoclast precursors by interfering with the transactivation function of c-Fos, which is an essential transcription factor for NFATc1 activation (26.Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T.

Cell. 2002; 3: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar). Whereas Dim1 has no apparent effect on c-Fos expression, it seems to antagonize Nfatc1 gene transactivation through negatively regulating c-Fos localization at NFATc1 locus. This idea is supported by the fact that Dim1 knockdown caused an increase in c-Fos binding to the NFATc1 promoter. The strong correlation between the cellular levels of Dim1 and the efficiency of Nfatc1 gene silencing we have observed in FIGURE 2., FIGURE 3. also fits well with the repression of NFATc1 target genes. This striking finding suggests that direct disruption of transcription integrity via the interaction between Dim1 and c-Fos is specific and significant in the regulation of bone remodeling. This is the first study indicating that Dim1 is a key molecule in determining the differentiation rate of osteoclasts as an upstream effector of RANKL signaling. Our study failed to show the binding of Dim1 to p65 subunit of NF-κB, suggesting that Dim1 is mainly targeting c-Fos to affect osteoclast differentiation. Our results, however, do not rule out the possibility that other signaling transduction pathways may also offer a molecular basis of Dim1-triggered repression of osteoclast differentiation. Thus, to better understand how much the Dim1-mediated regulatory mechanism contributes to osteoclast formation, it will be important to identify other osteoclast-specific genes whose transcription is particularly sensitive to Dim1 expression in future investigations. Keeping the balance between bone formation and resorption is tightly regulated by various hormones and cytokines in local microenvironments. Aberrant regulation of osteoclast formation and function has been implicated in bone loss with concomitant suppression of bone growth and repair, which can weaken the skeleton and increase the risk of fracture. The controlled manipulation of osteoclastogenesis can be used to arrest such conditions, protect against accelerated bone loss, and preserve bone mass. The association of Dim1 with bone disorders has not been reported so far. Therefore, our present study raises the possibility that Dim1 could be a novel therapeutic tool for osteoclastogenic disorders because of its preferential expression on osteoclast cells as well as its significant inhibitory role in differentiation into mature osteoclasts. In light of this view, Dim1-mediated inactivation of NFATc1 expression described in this study will be very useful for the purpose of gaining further insight on the process to osteoclast formation and treating patients suffering from bone loss or skeletal complications of disease. In addition, osteoclast pathway is known to be regulated by a combination of gene specific and general transcription factors, which collectively maintain normal osteoclastic resorption within an acceptable level. In this respect, investigating how these multiple osteoclastic transcription factors functionally interact with Dim1 will increase our understanding of anti-osteoclastogenic function of Dim1. In conclusion, we investigated the possible effects of Dim1 on osteoclastogenesis using defined experimental systems. Unexpectedly, our initial characterization of Dim1 demonstrated that Dim1 plays a critical role in controlling RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. We extended these findings by showing that c-Fos is the target for the observed function of Dim1 as an inhibitor of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Thus, our findings argue that the distinct interaction of Dim1 with c-Fos has a critical function in controlling RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. It remains a challenge to understand how Dim1 cooperates with other signaling factors that have been reported to be involved in osteoclast differentiation. Identification of additional factors as well as targets for Dim1 will definitely be required for deeper understanding of the molecular basis of disease associated with increased bone resorption.

Fifty-four patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) and 150 healthy subjects were examined in an experimental paradigm assessing the presence of speech illusion in neutral white noise. Socio-demographic, cognitive function and family history data were collected. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was administered in the patient group and the Structured Interview for Schizotypy-Revised (SIS-R), and the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE) in the control group. Patients had a much higher rate of speech illusions (33.3% versus 8.7%, ORadjusted: 5.1, 95% CI: 2.3–11.5), which was only partly explained by differences in IQ (ORadjusted: 3.4, 95% CI: 1.4–8.3). Differences were particularly marked for signals in random noise that were perceived as affectively salient (ORadjusted: 9.7, 95% CI: 1.8–53.9). Speech illusion tended to be associated with positive symptoms in patients (ORadjusted: 3.3, 95% CI: 0.9–11.6), particularly affectively salient illusions (ORadjusted: 8.3, 95% CI: 0.7–100.3). In controls, speech illusions were not associated with positive schizotypy (ORadjusted: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.3–3.4) or self-reported psychotic experiences (ORadjusted: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.4–4.6). Experimental paradigms indexing the tendency to detect affectively salient signals in noise may be used to identify liability to psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W2030419717,"Chromatin conformation has a major role in all cellular decisions. We showed previously that P53 pro-apoptotic target promoters are enriched with H3K9me3 mark and induction of P53 abrogates this repressive chromatin conformation by downregulating SUV39H1, the writer of this mark present on these promoters. In the present study, we demonstrate that in response to P53 stabilization, its pro-apoptotic target promoters become enriched with the H3K4me3 epigenetic mark as well as its readers, Wdr5, RbBP5 and Ash2L, which were not observed in response to SUV39H1 downregulation alone. Overexpression of Ash2L enhanced P53-dependent apoptosis in response to chemotherapy, associated with increased P53 pro-apoptotic gene promoter occupancy and target gene expression. In contrast, pre-silencing of Ash2L abrogated P53’s ability to induce the expression of these transcriptional targets, without affecting P53 or RNAP II recruitment. However, Ash2L pre-silencing, under the same conditions, resulted in reduced RNAP II ser5-CTD phosphorylation on these same pro-apoptotic target promoters, which correlated with reduced promoter occupancy of TFIIB as well as TFIIF (RAP74). Based on these findings, we propose that Ash2L acts in concert with P53 promoter occupancy to activate RNAP II by aiding formation of a stable transcription pre-initiation complex required for its activation."
https://openalex.org/W2016889104,"Conotruncal heart defect (CTD) is a complex form of congenital heart disease and usually has a poor prognosis. ZFPM2/FOG2 encodes a transcription cofactor that interacts with GATA4 to regulate cardiac development. This regulation has been established in knockout mouse models that display a range of heart malformations, especially CTD. Although previous studies have identified several missense variants in ZFPM2/FOG2 that may cause CTD, it remains unclear whether they are involved in CTD pathogenesis because the study populations were limited and the functional status was unknown. In this report, we screened a larger CTD population, which comprised 145 tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), 37 double-outlet ventricle outflow (DORV), and 18 transposition of the great artery (TGA), to investigate exon mutations as well as copy number variations in ZFPM2/FOG2. Four variants (p.V339I in one DORV, p.A426T in one DORV, p.M703L in three TOF, p.T843M in one TOF) were found in six patients, of which two are reported here for the first time. No copy number variations of the gene were detected. GST pull-down assays demonstrated that all potentially deleterious variants, including those previously reported, did not impair the interaction with GATA4, except for variant p.M544I and p.K737E, which subtly impaired the binding. Thus, these missense variants may be involved in other mechanisms underlying CTD or may be unrelated to CTD occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2087065641,"As a special class of short non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (a.k.a. miRNAs or miRs) have been reported to perform important roles in various biological processes by regulating respective target genes. However, significant barriers exist during biologists' conventional miR knowledge discovery. Emerging semantic technologies, which are based upon domain ontologies, can render critical assistance to this problem. Our previous research has investigated the construction of a miR ontology, named Ontology for MIcroRNA Target Prediction (OMIT), the very first of its kind that formally encodes miR domain knowledge. Although it is unavoidable to have a manual component contributed by domain experts when building ontologies, many challenges have been identified for a completely manual development process. The most significant issue is that a manual development process is very labor-intensive and thus extremely expensive. Therefore, we propose in this paper an innovative ontology development methodology. Our contributions can be summarized as: (i) We have continued the development and critical improvement of OMIT, solidly based on our previous research outcomes. (ii) We have explored effective and efficient algorithms with which the ontology development can be seamlessly combined with machine intelligence and be accomplished in a semi-automated manner, thus significantly reducing large amounts of human efforts. A set of experiments have been conducted to thoroughly evaluate our proposed methodology."
https://openalex.org/W1996444782,"We investigated the impact of temporary food restriction on a set shifting task requiring participants to judge clusters of pictures against a frequently changing rule. 60 healthy female participants underwent two testing sessions: once after fasting for 16 hours and once in a satiated state. Participants also completed a battery of questionnaires (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]; Persistence, Perseveration and Perfectionism Questionnaire [PPPQ-22]; and Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire [EDE-Q6]). Set shifting costs were significantly increased after fasting; this effect was independent of self-reported mood and perseveration. Furthermore, higher levels of weight concern predicted a general performance decrement under conditions of fasting. We conclude that relatively short periods of fasting can lead to set shifting impairments. This finding may have relevance to studies of development, individual differences, and the interpretation of psychometric tests. It also could have implications for understanding the etiology and maintenance of eating disorders, in which impaired set shifting has been implicated."
https://openalex.org/W2042876305,"A new moisture adjusted vegetation index (MAVI) is proposed using the red, near infrared, and shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance in band-ratio form in this paper. The effectiveness of MAVI in retrieving leaf area index (LAI) is investigated using Landsat-5 data and field LAI measurements in two forest and two grassland areas. The ability of MAVI to retrieve forest LAI under different background conditions is further evaluated using canopy reflectance of Jack Pine and Black Spruce forests simulated by the 4-Scale model. Compared with several commonly used two-band vegetation index, such as normalized difference vegetation index, soil adjusted vegetation index, modified soil adjusted vegetation index, optimized soil adjusted vegetation index, MAVI is a better predictor of LAI, on average, which can explain 70% of variations of LAI in the four study areas. Similar to other SWIR-related three-band vegetation index, such as modified normalized difference vegetation index (MNDVI) and reduced simple ratio (RSR), MAVI is able to reduce the background reflectance effects on forest canopy LAI retrieval. MAVI is more suitable for retrieving LAI than RSR and MNDVI, because it avoids the difficulty in properly determining the maximum and minimum SWIR values required in RSR and MNDVI, which improves the robustness of MAVI in retrieving LAI of different land cover types. Moreover, MAVI is expressed as ratios between different spectral bands, greatly reducing the noise caused by topographical variations, which makes it more suitable for applications in mountainous area."
https://openalex.org/W1964306014,"Background/Aims Emerging data links different aspects of lipid metabolism to liver regeneration. In patients with acute liver failure (ALF), low levels of lipids may correlate with disease severity. Thus, we determined whether there is an etiology-specific link between lipid levels in patients suffering from ALF and aimed to investigate an effect of lipid levels on the prognosis of ALF. Methods In this retrospective single center study, we reviewed 89 consecutive ALF patients, who met the criteria of the “Acute Liver Failure Study Group”. Patient characteristics, clinical data and laboratory parameters were individually analyzed at admission and correlated with the patients' outcome after a four week follow up. Possible endpoints were either discharge, or death or liver transplantation. Results High-density lipoprotein (HDL), cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly lower in patients who died or required a liver transplant. HDL levels were significantly higher in patients with ALF caused by acetaminophen intoxication, compared to fulminant HBV infection or drug induced liver injury. HDL levels correlated with hepatic injury by ALT levels, and Albumin, and inversely correlated with the MELD score, INR, and bilirubin. Conclusion In our cohort of patients with ALF, we could show that HDL and cholesterol are suppressed. In addition novel etiology specific patterns between acteminophen and non-acteminophen induced liver failure were detected for serum lipid components. Further studies are needed to address the role of cholesterol and lipid metabolism and the according pathways in different etiologies of ALF."
https://openalex.org/W1987651273,"The far-red limit of photosystem I (PS I) photochemistry was studied by EPR spectroscopy using laser flashes between 730 and 850 nm. In manganese-depleted spinach thylakoid membranes, the primary donor in PS I, P700, was oxidized simultaneously with tyrosine Z, the secondary donor in PS II. It was found that at 295 K PS I photochemistry, observed as P700 (+) formation, was functional up to 840 nm. This is 30 nm further to the red region than was reported for PS II photochemistry (Thapper, A., Mamedov, F., Mokvist, F., Hammarström, L., and Styring, S. (2009) Plant Cell 21, 2391-2401). The same far-red limit for the P700 (+) formation was observed in a PS I reaction center core preparation from Nostoc punctiforme. The reduction of the acceptor side of PS I, observed as reduction of the iron-sulfur centers FA and FB by low temperature EPR measurements, was also functional at 15 K with light up to >830 nm. Taken together, these results, obtained from both plants and cyanobacteria, most likely rule out involvement of the red-absorbing antenna chlorophylls in this reaction. Instead we propose the existence of weak charge transfer bands absorbing in the far-red region in the ensemble of excitonically coupled chlorophyll a molecules around P700 similar to what has been found in the reaction center of PS II. These charge transfer bands could be responsible for the far-red light absorption leading to PS I photochemistry at wavelengths up to 840 nm."
https://openalex.org/W2150795000,"Although increased serum histamine levels and H1R expression in the plaque are seen in atherosclerosis, it is not known whether H1R activation is a causative factor in the development of the disease, or is a host defense response to atherogenic signals. In order to elucidate how pharmacological inhibition of histamine receptor 1 (H1R) signaling affects atherogenesis, we administered either cetirizine (1 and 4 mg/kg. b.w) or fexofenadine (10 and 40 mg/kg. b.w) to ApoE-/- mice maintained on a high fat diet for three months. Mice ingesting a low dose of cetirizine or fexofenadine had significantly higher plaque coverage in the aorta and cross-sectional lesion area at the aortic root. Surprisingly, the higher doses of cetirizine or fexofenadine did not enhance atherosclerotic lesion coverage over the controls. The low dose of fexofenadine, but not cetirizine, increased serum LDL cholesterol. Interestingly, the expression of iNOS and eNOS mRNA was increased in aortas of mice on high doses of cetirizine or fexofenadine. This may be a compensatory nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilatory mechanism that accounts for the lack of increase in the progression of atherosclerosis. Although the administration of cetirizine did not alter blood pressure between the groups, there was a positive correlation between blood pressure and lesion/media ratio at the aortic root in mice receiving the low dose of cetirizine. However, this association was not observed in mice treated with the high dose of cetirizine or either doses of fexofenadine. The macrophages or T lymphocytes densities were not altered by low doses of H1-antihistamines, whereas, high doses decreased the number of macrophages but not T lymphocytes. The number of mast cells was decreased only in mice treated with low dose of fexofenadine. These results demonstrate that chronic ingestion of low therapeutic doses of cetirizine or fexofenadine enhance progression of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2044796076,"The metazoan mitochondrial DNA helicase is an integral part of the minimal mitochondrial replisome. It exhibits strong sequence homology with the bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein primase-helicase (T7 gp4). Both proteins contain distinct N- and C-terminal domains separated by a flexible linker. The C-terminal domain catalyzes its characteristic DNA-dependent NTPase activity, and can unwind duplex DNA substrates independently of the N-terminal domain. Whereas the N-terminal domain in T7 gp4 contains a DNA primase activity, this function is lost in metazoan mtDNA helicase. Thus, although the functions of the C-terminal domain and the linker are partially understood, the role of the N-terminal region in the metazoan replicative mtDNA helicase remains elusive. Here, we show that the N-terminal domain of Drosophila melanogaster mtDNA helicase coordinates iron in a 2Fe-2S cluster that enhances protein stability in vitro. The N-terminal domain binds the cluster through conserved cysteine residues (Cys(68), Cys(71), Cys(102), and Cys(105)) that are responsible for coordinating zinc in T7 gp4. Moreover, we show that the N-terminal domain binds both single- and double-stranded DNA oligomers, with an apparent Kd of ∼120 nm. These findings suggest a possible role for the N-terminal domain of metazoan mtDNA helicase in recruiting and binding DNA at the replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W2039924667,"Prenatal exposure to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produces hypertension in adult offspring rats. The present study was to explore the effects of prenatal inflammation on morphological and functional changes in the aorta from offspring rats and to further assess its susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases.Pregnant rats were treated intraperitoneally on gestation Days 8, 10 and 12 with saline, LPS (0.79 mg/kg), or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 100 mg/kg)+LPS, respectively. Aortic ring reactivity and histopathological alteration were analyzed in offspring at the age of 12 weeks. The detections of connexin (Cx) 37, Cx40, Cx43, and Cx45, including immunofluorescent patterns, protein levels and mRNA expression in the aorta, were performed as well. Furthermore, the expressions of Nuclear factor (NF)-κB (p65), IκBα, phospho-IκBα and IκBβ were determined. The results showed that prenatal LPS exposure leads to morphological abnormalities and impaired aortic reactivity in offspring. Prenatal LPS exposure also decreased the protein and mRNA expression of Cx37 in the aorta from offspring rats. NF-κB and phospho-IκBα levels were both increased, IκBα level, however, was decreased in the aorta of offspring from the maternal LPS exposure compared to the controls. Simultaneously, PDTC treatment markedly reversed the action of LPS.Decreased expression of Cx37 contributed to the aortic dysfunction of prenatal LPS exposure offspring, which should be associated with NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2064268364,"Nanociliates have been frequently found to be important players in the marine microbial loop, however, little is known about their diversity and distribution in coastal ecosystems. We investigated the molecular diversity and distribution patterns of nanoplanktonic oligotrich and choreotrich (OC) ciliates in surface water of three neritic basins of northern China, the South Yellow Sea (SYS), North Yellow Sea (NYS), and Bohai Sea (BS) in June and November 2011. SSU rRNA gene clone libraries generated from three summertime samples (sites B38, B4 and H8) were analyzed and revealed a large novel ribotype diversity, of which many were low-abundant phylotypes belonging to the subclass Oligotrichia, but divergent from described morphospecies. Based on the data of terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of all 35 samples, we found that the T-RF richness was generally higher in the SYS than in the BS, and negatively correlated with the molar ratio of P to Si. Overall, multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance of the community turnover demonstrated a distinct seasonal pattern but no basin-to-basin differentiation across all samples. Nevertheless, significant community differences among basins were recognized in the winter dataset. Mantel tests showed that the environmental factors, P:Si ratio, water temperature and concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), determined the community across all samples. However, both biogeographic distance and environment shaped the community in winter, with DO being the most important physicochemical factor. Our results indicate that the stoichiometric ratio of P:Si is a key factor, through which the phytoplankton community may be shaped, resulting in a cascade effect on the diversity and community composition of OC nanociliates in the N-rich, Si-limited coastal surface waters, and that the Yellow Sea Warm Current drives the nanociliate community, and possibly the microbial food webs, in the coastal ecosystem in winter."
https://openalex.org/W2078581577,"Although airway epithelia are primarily devoted to gas exchange, they have to fulfil a number of different tasks including organ maintenance and the epithelial immune response to fight airborne pathogens. These different tasks are at least partially accomplished by specialized cell types in the epithelium. In addition, a proximal to distal gradient mirroring the transition from airflow conduction to real gas exchange, is also operative. We analysed the airway system of larval Drosophila melanogaster with respect to region-specific expression in the proximal to distal axis. The larval airway system is made of epithelial cells only. We found differential expression between major trunks of the airways and more distal ones comprising primary, secondary and terminal ones. A more detailed analysis was performed using DNA-microarray analysis to identify cohorts of genes that are either predominantly expressed in the dorsal trunks or in the primary/secondary/terminal branches of the airways. Among these differentially expressed genes are especially those involved in signal transduction. Wnt-signalling associated genes for example are predominantly found in secondary/terminal airways. In addition, some G-protein coupled receptors are differentially expressed between both regions of the airways, exemplified by those activated by octopamine or tyramine, the invertebrate counterparts of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Whereas the OAMB is predominantly found in terminal airway regions, the oct3βR has higher expression levels in dorsal trunks. In addition, we observed a significant association of both, genes predominantly expressed in dorsal trunks or in primary to terminal branches branches with those regulated by hypoxia. Taken together, this observed differential expression is indicative for a proximal to distal transcriptional regionalization presumably reflecting functional differences in these parts of the fly's airway system."
https://openalex.org/W2068348842,"This project explores techniques for reducing the complexity of an agent-based model (ABM). The analysis involved a model developed from the ethnographic research of Dr. Lee Hoffer in the Larimer area heroin market, which involved drug users, drug sellers, homeless individuals and police. The authors used statistical techniques to create a reduced version of the original model which maintained simulation fidelity while reducing computational complexity. This involved identifying key summary quantities of individual customer behavior as well as overall market activity and replacing some agents with probability distributions and regressions. The model was then extended to allow external market interventions in the form of police busts. Extensions of this research perspective, as well as its strengths and limitations, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2077181549,"The membrane-bound tetraacyldisaccharide-1-phosphate 4'-kinase, LpxK, catalyzes the sixth step of the lipid A (Raetz) biosynthetic pathway and is a viable antibiotic target against emerging Gram-negative pathogens. We report the crystal structure of lipid IVA, the LpxK product, bound to the enzyme, providing a rare glimpse into interfacial catalysis and the surface scanning strategy by which many poorly understood lipid modification enzymes operate. Unlike the few previously structurally characterized proteins that bind lipid A or its precursors, LpxK binds almost exclusively to the glucosamine/phosphate moieties of the lipid molecule. Steady-state kinetic analysis of multiple point mutants of the lipid-binding pocket pinpoints critical residues involved in substrate binding, and characterization of N-terminal helix truncation mutants uncovers the role of this substructure as a hydrophobic membrane anchor. These studies make critical contributions to the limited knowledge surrounding membrane-bound enzymes that act upon lipid substrates and provide a structural template for designing small molecule inhibitors targeting this essential kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1963504022,"The phylogenetic relationships within the Stellifer group of weakfishes (Stellifer, Odontoscion, Ophioscion, and Bairdiella) were evaluated using 2723 base pairs comprising sequences of nuclear (rhodopsin, TMO-4C4, RAG-1) and mitochondrial (16S rRNA and COI) markers obtained from specimens of nine species. Our results indicate a close relationship between Bairdiella and Odontoscion, and also that the genus Stellifer is not monophyletic, but rather that it consists of two distinct lineages, one clade containing S. microps/S. naso/S. brasiliensis and the other, S. rastrifer/S. stellifer/Stellifer sp. B, which is closer to Ophioscion than the former clade. The O. punctatissimus populations from the northern and southern Brazilian coast were also highly divergent in both nuclear (0.8% for rhodopsin and 0.9% for RAG-1) and mitochondrial sequences (2.2% for 16S rRNA and 7.3% for COI), which we conclude is consistent with the presence of two distinct species. The morphological similarities of the members of the Stellifer group is reinforced by the molecular data from both the present study and previous analyses, which have questioned the taxonomic status of the Stellifer group. If, on the one hand, the group is in fact composed of four genera (Stellifer, Ophioscion, Odontoscion, and Bairdiella), one of the two Stellifer clades should be reclassified as a new genus. However, if the close relationship and the reduced genetic divergence found within the group is confirmed in a more extensive study, including representatives of additional taxa, this, together with the morphological evidence, would support downgrading the whole group to a single genus. Obviously, these contradictory findings reinforce the need for a more systematic taxonomic revision of the Stellifer group as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W1966593377,"In patients with spinal stenosis, magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine can be improved by using 3D driven-equilibrium fast spin echo sequences to provide a high-resolution assessment of osseous and ligamentous structures. However, it is not yet clear whether 3D driven-equilibrium fast spin echo sequences adequately evaluate the spinal cord itself. As a result, they are generally supplemented by additional 2D fast spin echo sequences, adding time to the examination and potential discomfort to the patient. Here we investigate the hypothesis that in patients with spinal stenosis and spondylotic myelopathy, 3D driven-equilibrium fast spin echo sequences can characterize cord lesions equally well as 2D fast spin echo sequences. We performed a retrospective analysis of 30 adult patients with spondylotic myelopathy who had been examined with both 3D driven-equilibrium fast spin echo sequences and 2D fast spin echo sequences at the same scanning session. The two sequences were inspected separately for each patient, and visible cord lesions were manually traced. We found no significant differences between 3D driven-equilibrium fast spin echo and 2D fast spin echo sequences in the mean number, mean area, or mean transverse dimensions of spondylotic cord lesions. Nevertheless, the mean contrast-to-noise ratio of cord lesions was decreased on 3D driven-equilibrium fast spin echo sequences compared to 2D fast spin echo sequences. These findings suggest that 3D driven-equilibrium fast spin echo sequences do not need supplemental 2D fast spin echo sequences for the diagnosis of spondylotic myelopathy, but they may be less well suited for quantitative signal measurements in the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2075333915,"Whole-body water immersion (WI) has been reported to change sensorimotor integration. However, primary motor cortical excitability is not affected by low-intensity afferent input. Here we explored the effects of whole-body WI and water flow stimulation (WF) on corticospinal excitability and intracortical circuits. Eight healthy subjects participated in this study. We measured the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) produced by single transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses and examined conditioned MEP amplitudes by paired-pulse TMS. We evaluated short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) using the paired-TMS technique before and after 15-min intervention periods. Two interventions used were whole-body WI with water flow to the lower limbs (whole-body WF) and whole-body WI without water flow to the lower limbs (whole-body WI). The experimental sequence included a baseline TMS assessment (T0), intervention for 15 min, a second TMS assessment immediately after intervention (T1), a 10 min resting period, a third TMS assessment (T2), a 10 min resting period, a fourth TMS assessment (T3), a 10 min resting period, and the final TMS assessment (T4). SICI and ICF were evaluated using a conditioning stimulus of 90% active motor threshold and a test stimulus adjusted to produce MEPs of approximately 1-1.2 mV, and were tested at intrastimulus intervals of 3 and 10 ms, respectively. Whole-body WF significantly increased MEP amplitude by single-pulse TMS and led to a decrease in SICI in the contralateral motor cortex at T1, T2 and T3. Whole-body WF also induced increased corticospinal excitability and decreased SICI. In contrast, whole-body WI did not change corticospinal excitability or intracortical circuits."

Depending on the research question it may be advantageous to establish multicenter studies as a way of organizing clinical trials in order to increase study power.The object of this study was to investigate the development in the organization of multicenter studies, the distribution of studies within different clinical specialties, across continents, and investigate the differences related to testing various interventions.A literature search was done in MEDLINE for multicenter studies published in 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010, respectively. Data extraction identified data related to clinical specialties, interventions, participating patients, departments, countries, and continents.The number of multicenter studies increased from 112 in 1995 to 1,273 in 2010, with a larger share of multicenter studies being performed in Europe and North America. The pharmacological interventions were primarily being tested in medical studies followed by the device tests predominantly in surgical studies. The number of included patients as well as the number of participating departments increased during the time span, though the increase in studies was most evident in Europe and North America compared with the rest of the world."
