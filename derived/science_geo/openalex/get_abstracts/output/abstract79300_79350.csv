https://openalex.org/W1487436709,"Abstract 1. An enzyme that catalyzes the formation of formyl-d-kynurenine from d-tryptophan was purified about 100-fold from a homogenate of rabbit small intestine. Formyl-d-kynurenine thus produced was converted to d-kynurenine by formamidase present in rabbit intestine. 2. Methylene blue and ascorbic acid were required as cofactors. Xanthine oxidase with hypoxanthine could replace ascorbic acid, but hydrogen peroxide, added as such or enzymatically generated by glucose oxidase or l-amino acid oxidase, was not effective. Addition of catalase failed to inhibit the enzyme. 3. Several lines of evidence indicated the involvement of heme in the catalysis by the enzyme. An absorption spectrum characteristic of hemoprotein was observed in the purified active enzyme preparations. Inhibition by potassium cyanide or carbon monoxide was observed. The inhibition by carbon monoxide was reversed by illumination. 4. The purified enzyme could oxidize l-tryptophan as well as d-tryptophan. Kynurenine derived from l-tryptophan via formylkynurenine was identified as the l-isomer. Methylene blue and ascorbic acid were also required. A marked substrate inhibition was observed with l-tryptophan, but not with d-tryptophan."
https://openalex.org/W1599014832,"Solutions of globular actin have been isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle and purified by repetitive cycles of the reversible globular ⇄ fibrous transformation. Electrophoretic, ultracentrifugal, and gel filtration studies of these preparations revealed the presence of multiple macromolecular components. On the other hand, solutions of G-actin isolated by molecular exclusion chromatography exhibited a high degree of particle homogeneity. An appreciable, yet variable, fraction (15 to 75%) of the total protein isolated from acetone powders by reversible polymerization procedures is not globular actin. The predominant impurity is devoid of both ADP and ATP, and it is not transformed to fibrous actin in the presence of dilute aqueous KCl. Gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G-200) eliminates this material. In agreement with earlier studies of Adelstein, Godfrey, and Kielley (4), this procedure represents a valuable preparative feature in the isolation of chemically homogeneous, monomeric actin. In the presence of dilute aqueous solutions of KCl, the chromatographically isolated protein is quantitatively transformed to F-actin. Molecular weight studies indicate that the mass of electrophoretically homogeneous G-actin is close to 46,000 g per mole (Mn0 = 46,500 and Mw0 = 45,800). When the reduced S-carboxymethylated protein is transferred to concentrated solutions of guanidine-HCl, the particle weight remains essentially unchanged (Mn0 = 47,600 and Mw0 = 47,800). This information implies that globular actin is constructed from a single, covalently linked poly-peptide chain."

https://openalex.org/W1523698595,"Abstract The role of the pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon, in the regulation of hepatic tyrosine transaminase (l-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) was studied in adrenalectomized rats. Each of these hormones initiated a rapid but limited increase in the enzyme level, which reached a maximum after 2.5 to 3 hours. The optimal doses of insulin and glucagon per 100 g of body weight were 0.75 unit (33 µg) and 150 µg, respectively. Alloxan-induced diabetes in adrenalectomized rats caused a significant increase in the transaminase level after 5 days. Immunochemical-isotopic analyses showed that the pancreatic hormones cause an increase in the rate of transaminase synthesis which is comparable to that caused by hydrocortisone. Effects of the pancreatic hormones on the rate of enzyme synthesis are not additive with one another but are additive with the effect of hydrocortisone. Induction by either insulin or glucagon was inhibited by actinomycin D. A discrete mechanism for induction of this enzyme, which is steroid-independent and which can be initiated in vivo by either insulin or glucagon, is indicated."

https://openalex.org/W2088707653,"The characteristic ability of rat uteri to take up tritiated estradiol in vitro or to retain estradiol previously incorporated either in vivo or in vitro is destroyed by treating the tissue with various sulfhydryl-blocking reagents. The two radioactive estradiol-receptor complexes, observed in uterine homogenates in the supernatant fraction and in an extract of the nuclear fraction, respectively, are disrupted by brief exposure to organic mercurials in the cold. Sulfhydryl groups of uterine receptor substances apparently play a vital role in estradiol binding, perhaps indirectly through contribution to receptor conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2031365601,"Infectious entities, extractable, with phosphate buffer, from tissue infected with potato spindle tuber virus and inciting symptoms on tomato that are typical of this virus, have properties incompatible with those of conventional virus particles. The infectious particles sediment in sucrose density gradients at approximately the same rate as particles with a sedimentation coefficient of 10S, are insensitive to treatment with organic solvents, and can be concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Treatment with phenol changes neither their infectivity nor their sedimentation properties. Infectivity is insensitive to deoxyribonuclease, but at low ionic strength it is sensitive to ribonuclease. At high ionic strength, infectivity partially survives incubation with ribonuclease. These properties, as well as elution patterns from columns of methylated serum albumin, suggest that the extractable infectious agent may be a double-stranded RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1492432276,"Uptake and inhibition studies show that the uptake of neutral amino acids by the pigeon red blood cell is divided among four systems: a Na+-independent, nonexchanging system operative for amino acids with large hydrocarbon side chains; a Na+-dependent, exchanging system (ASCP) for alanine, serine, cysteine, proline, and probably also threonine and similar amino acids, very similar to systems seen in the Ehrlich cell (ASC) and the rabbit reticulocyte; a system effective for glycine and sarcosine already studied by Vidaver; and a system reactive with β-alanine and taurine but not with α-amino acids. The transport of valine was shown to be divided between the principal Na+-independent systems; that of glycine, between the glycine system and the ASCP system. These relations were supported by differences in the competitive interactions among the amino acids for transport, by the activity of various amino acids in accelerating the exodus of labeled or endogenous amino acids from the cell by countertransport, which is limited to the ASCP system, and by interactions between amino acids and Na+ and H+. Uptake by the two broad spectrum systems was minimally sensitive to metabolic inhibitors, except for a special sensitivity to anionic sulfhydryl reagents, without, however, an interruption of countertransport. Energy to permit uphill transport of various amino acids may reach the exchanging system by way of the system for glycine. The character of the dependence of the velocity, the Km and the Vmax for amino acid uptake on the Na+ concentration was different among the three Na+-dependent systems."
https://openalex.org/W1482520059,"In attempts to complete the amino acid sequence of subtilisin BPN', the diisopropylphosphoryl derivative was cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and the peptides were separated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. Four of the expected six fragments were isolated in pure form; the other two were purified together but could not be separated from each other. Tryptic digestion of the mixture of the two cyanogen bromide fragments produced six of the expected seven peptides. The remaining peptide was obtained by tryptic digestion of the diisopropylphosphoryl derivative of subtilisin BPN' followed by BrCN cleavage of the tryptic peptides. This procedure permitted the isolation of the peptide missing from the former procedure as well as the other expected peptides. This information combined with that previously obtained from the tryptic, chymotryptic, and peptic digests has provided the evidence to construct a unique amino acid sequence for the 275 residues in subtilisin BPN'. Proof of this structure is provided along with a discussion of some of the features of the sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1625220772,"Abstract When dl-1,2-propanediol-1-3H is converted to propionaldehyde in the presence of dioldehydrase and cobamide coenzyme, tritium is transferred to the coenzyme. The tritiated coenzyme so obtained transfers tritium to the reaction product when reacted with dl-1,2-propanediol and apoenzyme. The coenzyme is tritiated exclusively at the C-5' position of the adenosyl moiety. The location of tritium was established by chemical degradation and further confirmed by showing that chemically synthesized cobamide coenzyme, containing tritium at the C-5' position, transferred tritium to the product when added to enzyme and unlabeled substrate. The conversion of dl-1,2-propanediol-1-3H to propionaldehyde proceeds with inter- and intramolecular tritium transfer. Approximately 1% of the tritiated substrate reacts by intramolecular transfer, i.e. the hydrogen abstracted from C-1 of a substrate molecule is found in the α position of the aldehyde derived from that molecule. A partial reaction occurs, as evidenced by tritium exchange between tritiated coenzyme and propionaldehyde or acetaldehyde under conditions in which no net reaction occurs. The results obtained have led to the following tentative reaction sequence. Hydrogen is abstracted from C-1 of dl-1,2-propanediol and transferred to the coenzyme, where it becomes equivalent with at least one, but probably both, hydrogens of the C-5' position. This results in the formation of a reduced form of the coenzyme and a molecule derived through the oxidation of the substrate. In a subsequent step the hydrated form of propionaldehyde is formed by a transfer of hydrogen from the reduced coenzyme to the intermediate derived from the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1586376120,"In the presence of flavin mononucleotide and light, methionine is nonenzymatically oxidized to carbon dioxide, formic acid, ethylene, methyl disulfide, and ammonia. Tracer studies indicate that these products arise, respectively, from carbon atoms 1, 2, 3, and 4, methylmercapto, and amino groups of methionine. It is suggested that the first photochemical reaction is the oxidation of methionine to methional, ammonia, and carbon dioxide, followed by the degradation of methional to ethylene and other products. The optimal pH for ethylene production by this reaction is about 8.5, and the reaction velocity is directly proportional to the concentration of flavin mononucleotide and methionine. Ethylene production is greatly inhibited by Cu++, paramagnetic ions, and various phenolic compounds. Flavin mononucleotide can be replaced by riboflavin. Methional and α-keto-γ-methylmercaptopropionic acid are the most effective precursors of ethylene. Structural requirements for ethylene precursors were studied, and a mechanism accounting for ethylene production from methionine is described."
https://openalex.org/W1555912259,"Abstract The kinetics of the reactions of human hemoglobin with ligands, mainly with carbon monoxide, have been studied over a wide range of protein concentrations in dilute and concentrated salt solutions and hence under conditions which promote dissociation of the protein into subunits. Both in stopped flow and flash photolysis experiments, the kinetic behavior of hemoglobin did not change in the presence of high salt concentrations which promote the dissociation of tetramer into αβ dimers. The results indicate that the αβ units exhibit all the characteristic features of the kinetics of the reaction of hemoglobin with ligands and suggest a reinterpretation of the hemoglobin kinetics in terms of models based on the dimer rather than on the tetramer."

Body fluids from two species of Potamotrygon, permanent residents of the Amazon basin, contained only 2 to 3 milligrams of urea nitrogen per 100 milliliters. Although they have abandoned the retention of urea exhibited by other chondrichthyans, the extent to which they have lost the mechanisms of retaining and tolerating urea in a hypertonic medium has not been determined."

Increasing the area of illumination decreases the variation at low frequencies of modulation, but unexpectedly enhances-or ""amplifies""-the variation at the intermediate frequencies to which the eye is most sensitive. Both effects must result from inhibition since it is the only significant lateral influence in this eye."

https://openalex.org/W1604625487,"Abstract Extracts of rat heart hydrolyze adenylate via two pathways. The first involves deamination to yield inosinate, followed by dephosphorylation to yield inosine; the second involves dephosphorylation to adenosine, followed by deamination to yield inosine. Adenosine triphosphate activates the first and inhibits the second pathway. It does so by activating adenylate deaminase and inhibiting adenylate phosphatase. Guanosine triphosphate reverses the action of ATP on adenylate deaminase; it also inhibits adenylate phosphatase. Neither ATP nor GTP affects the activity of adenosine deaminase. The evidence for these conclusions is based on the identification and measurement of the products formed on incubating 3H- and 32P-labeled adenylate with heart extracts in the presence and absence of ATP, GTP, and adenosine. The separation by gel filtration of the regulated adenylate deaminase from adenosine deaminase is reported. The two pathways also occur in lung."
https://openalex.org/W1522789034,"Abstract Reduction of thioredoxin reductase with different reductants has been followed spectrally; by titration with TPNH in the presence of DPNase or with dithionite, it has been shown that this enzyme can accept 4 electrons per FAD. Thus, an additional acceptor group is postulated and is identified as a disulfide group which undergoes reversible reduction to a dithiol. The thioredoxin reductase activity is very sensitive to low concentrations of mercurial, whereas the transhydrogenase activity requires much higher levels for inhibition. Prereduction of the enzyme enhances the former, but not the latter process. Amperometric titrations show that the 4 cysteic acid residues per FAD, determined by amino acid analysis, arise from 2 free sulfhydryls and a disulfide bond which is reducible by TPNH. Mercurials are shown, in spectral experiments, to shift the electrons from the flavin the second redox group by trapping action on the nascent dithiol; after such a treatment, the enzyme is completely reduced by only 2 electrons per FAD and cannot be reoxidized by thioredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1601283433,"Abstract Bovine corneal keratosulfate was permethylated in nonaqueous solvent after prior peracetylation. The methyl ethers were isolated after hydrolysis and characterized either as crystalline derivatives or by their physical and chemical properties. The main repeating unit is N-acetyllactosamine polymerized via a 1 → 3 linkage to galactose, as reported previously. About 74% of the N-acetylglucosaminyl groups are sulfated in position 6. However, about 40% of the galactosyl groups are also substituted in position 6, at least in the major portion by sulfate ester groups. This was shown by the isolation and characterization of galactose 6-sulfate from partial acid hydrolysates. In addition, N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate and oligosaccharides sulfated to varying degrees were also obtained. The polymer contained about 25% of galactosyl groups in excess of hexosamine. This excess is preferentially hydrolyzed and may indicate branch points. Evidence of N-methylation of glucosamine was obtained. The color reactions and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of N-methylglucosamine are compared with those of N-acetylglucosamine."
https://openalex.org/W1564951920,"Abstract Clostridium butyricum grown in medium supplemented with radioactive pantothenic acid incorporates this compound into both protein and nonprotein fractions of the cell. Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is the major protein into which pantothenic acid is incorporated. C. butyricum ACP was isolated as a homogeneous protein, as judged by column chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, disc gel electrophoresis, and analytical ultracentrifugation. This protein contains a single sulfhydryl residue, 2-mercaptoethylamine, which is a component of the prosthetic group, 4'-phosphopantetheine. The prosthetic group is cleaved from the protein when the protein is incubated at pH 12, 70°, for 1 hour. Although this protein has properties similar to those of ACP of Escherichia coli, the amino acid compositions of the two proteins are different. The chemical synthesis of long chain fatty acyl-ACP derivatives is described. In this procedure other unidentified groups of the protein are acylated as well as the sulfhydryl group. The effects of acylation or acylation and alkylation of groups other than the sulfhydryl group of ACP were studied by testing ACP regenerated from such derivatives in the malonyl coenzyme A-CO2 exchange reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1522858884,"Abstract Moderate doses of the hypophysial growth hormone can effect a selective repression of the synthesis of rat liver tyrosine transaminase (l-tyrosine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) in hypophysectomized, as well as in adrenalectomized, rats. The response is erratic, which may reflect the action of competing hormones or the fact that the hepatic repression is secondary to another metabolic alteration brought about by growth hormone. When repression occurs, the hepatic level of the enzyme falls at approximately the rate at which degradation occurs in normal turnover. The rate of transaminase synthesis is reduced nearly to zero, as determined by immunochemical-isotopic analyses, while labeling of the bulk of the liver proteins is increased by the hormone. Repression is blocked when RNA synthesis is inhibited by actinomycin."
https://openalex.org/W1573909105,"Abstract Interaction of human serum albumin with anionic azo dyes decreases the susceptibility of the former to hydrolytic attack by five different proteases. By using methyl orange as the ligand, it is shown that the occupation of the two strong binding sites by the dye is necessary and sufficient for this effect. Different ligands decrease the digestibility of albumin to different extents when tested with the same protease. The pattern of digestion, studied by electrophoresis and gel filtration, also exhibits differences which are characteristic for the ligand used. Thus, methyl orange greatly reduces the yield of the 51,000 mol wt fragment, which regularly appears in the course of tryptic digestion in the absence of ligand. In addition, the relative quantities of the smaller fragments obtained vary with the ligand used in a characteristic manner. Analysis of the kinetics of digestion in the presence and absence of ligand suggests that the major effect of ligand is to increase the stability or to decrease the availability of hydrolyzable bonds, with little alteration of the stability of the enzyme-substrate complex. It is concluded that the conformations stabilized by ligands are different from each other and are characteristic for the ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1506991983,Abstract The reaction of cycloserine with pyridoxal 5-phosphate has been investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. The substantial change in fluorescence intensity at 450 mµ that follows the reaction of cycloserine with pyridoxal 5-phosphate was used to monitor the release of the cofactor from the active site of the enzyme glutamate aspartate transaminase. A kinetic analysis of the fluorescence measurements reveals that the resolution of the enzyme is favored at pH values below 5 in the presence of phosphate ions. The inactive species produced by the reaction with cycloserine can be reactivated by incubation with pyridoxal 5-phosphate. These studies provide information on the firmness of binding of pyridoxal 5-phosphate to the active site of the enzyme.
https://openalex.org/W1550518101,"Abstract Hen duodenal adenosine deaminase has been purified from an acetone powder by the following techniques: heating to 58°, fractionation with ammonium sulfate, and column chromatography on epichlorohydrin triethanolamine cellulose and DEAE-Sephadex. The purified material was chromatographically homogeneous on DEAE-Sephadex; electrophoresis of the purified and concentrated enzyme yielded one large enzymatically active band (85%) and another band (15%) which was inactive. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 31,000 by use of a calibrated Sephadex G-100 column. The isoelectric point was determined to be 5.0 ± 0.2 pH units by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme does not give evidence for a tightly bound prosthetic group and dialysis against ethylenediaminetetraacetate does not lower the enzymatic activity. A readily accessible sulfhydryl group has been titrated with p-mercuribenzoate. Treatment of the native enzyme with 5 µm p-mercuribenzoate produces a stable mercuriated derivative that has an activity 2.5 fold greater than that of the native enzyme. This activation can be reversed by dialysis against dithiothreitol. Higher concentrations of the mercurial give a transient activation and then an irreversible inactivation. Treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (8 x 10-3 m) yields a 1.5-fold activation. The enzyme treated with N-ethylmaleimide is only inactivated by p-mercuribenzoate. These results indicate that there is one very reactive —SH group on the enzyme, and its substitution by either p-mercuribenzoate or N-ethylmaleimide leads to activation. Other groups are inaccessible to N-ethylmaleimide but can react with p-mercuribenzoate to give inactivation. Iodoacetamide does not appear to react with any group on the enzyme. Seven other mercurials were found to have similar activating action, but not all produced stable activated products. There does not seem to be any correlation between the charge on the ligand or its size and the amount of activation. The native and mercuriated enzymes deaminate adenosine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, 3'-deoxyadenosine, 2,6-diaminopurine riboside, and dechlorinate 6-chloropurine riboside. Relative substrate specificity ratios and Michaelis constants were determined for the above substrates. In contrast to most adenosine deaminases, inosine, deoxyinosine, and guanosine give product inhibition with both forms of the enzyme. In addition, purine riboside and 6-mercaptopurine riboside were found to be competitive inhibitors of adenosine, whereas N6-methyl- and N6-dimethyladenosine were not competitive inhibitors. None of the inhibitors were active as substrates. Ammonium sulfate at pH 9 was not inhibitory. All attempts to run the reaction in the reverse direction were unsuccessful. Energies of activation were calculated from Arrhenius plots for adenosine, 2,6-diaminopurine riboside, and 6-chloropurine riboside. Both the slopes and intercepts of Lineweaver-Burk plots were used. The mercuriated enzyme gave considerably lower values than the native enzyme. The energies of activation and the molecular activities were used to determine the ΔF‡, ΔH‡, and ΔS‡ for the slope and intercept terms for both enzymes when adenosine was the substrate. Whereas there is a relatively small change in the ΔF‡ terms upon mercuriation, both the ΔH‡ and ΔS‡ terms decreased strikingly."

https://openalex.org/W5465075,"This paper reports on the presence of a strong binding site for the dye Biebrich Scarlet, (6-[2-hydroxy-1-naphthyl]azo)-3,4'-azodibenzene sulfonic acid, on α-chymotrypsin. The 1:1 protein-dye complex is characterized by a Kdiss of 8.8 ± 0.1 x 10-5 m in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.6 and 22°. Complex formation is associated with a red shift in the visible spectrum of the dye, and a characteristic difference spectrum with a maximum at 550 mµ and a Δe m of 11,700. The dye is displaced from chymotrypsin by substrates, competitive inhibitors, and active site reagents, such as N-trans-cinnamoylimidazole and phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride. Thus, the binding site for Biebrich Scarlet overlaps the active site region in α-chymotrypsin. The dye does not bind strongly to chymotrypsinogen, or to trypsin, and shows no significant spectral perturbation in the presence of these proteins, under the conditions used in this study."
https://openalex.org/W1551494898,"Abstract Evidence is presented that purified guinea pig liver transglutaminase catalyzes the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate. As in the case of the other transglutaminase-catalyzed reactions, calcium ion is required for this esterolysis. This reaction involves the formation of a trimethylacetyl enzyme complex which has been shown by two procedures, burst in p-nitrophenol liberation and incorporation of 14C-trimethylacetyl, to have one trimethylacetyl group per molecule of protein. A trimethylacetyl enzyme complex containing 0.9 eq of trimethylacetyl has been isolated. Incorporation of trimethylacetyl is reflected in a concomitant loss in activity toward p-nitrophenyl acetate and for hydroxylamine incorporation into carbobenzoxy-l-glutaminylglycine. Studies on the inhibition of transglutaminase activity by p-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate and formation of 14C-trimethylacetyl enzyme, both as a function of calcium ion concentration, indicate that the same divalent cation-enzyme complexes are involved in p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis and in p-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate hydrolysis. Thus the apparent dissociation constants for the calcium-transglutaminase complex, as determined by inhibition and by trimethylacetyl enzyme formation at pH 7.0, are 0.37 ± 0.2 x 10-3 m and 0.54 ± 0.2 x 10-3 m, respectively. These values are comparable to the reported activator constant of calcium, 0.4 ± 0.2 x 10-3 m at pH 7.0, determined from the kinetics of p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis. A single radioactive peptide has been separated from a proteolytic digest of 14C-trimethylacetyl transglutaminase. Studies on the isolated peptide indicate that the trimethylacetyl group is bound in thioester linkage to a cysteine —SH group and to the same —SH group in the enzyme with which iodoacetamide reacts to form the inactive carbamidomethyl enzyme. These results are presented in support of a previously suggested cation-controlled mechanism of enzyme action involving the intermediate formation of an acyl enzyme through thioester linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1500397742,"Abstract The accumulation of K+ by isolated heart mitochondria suspended in isotonic sucrose is markedly stimulated by the addition of Zn++. The accumulation requires a source of energy, the presence of a permeant anion such as acetate, and the presence of either inorganic phosphate or arsenate. The reaction is inhibited and reversed by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and by anaerobiosis. It is also inhibited by Mg++ and Na+ ions and by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and other Zn++ chelators. The Zn++-dependent accumulation is accompanied by increased respiration and extensive reversible swelling of the mitochondria. The extent of the observed swelling and the time course of swelling are dependent on the concentration of K+ and of Zn++. In the absence of added K+, Zn++ induces a rapid energy-linked expulsion of the endogenous K+ of the mitochondrion. These studies indicate that the addition of Zn++ under carefully defined experimental conditions is sufficient to induce the transport of K+ by heart mitochondria. This transport of K+ closely resembles that reported by other investigators in the presence of valinomycin, gramicidin, and parathyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2043033181,"The transition-state theory of chemical kinetics, coupled with relatively crude methods of constructing potential-energy surfaces for reacting systems, has great utility in the forecasting of kinetic properties. In particular, it permits prediction of the effect of isotopic substitution on rate constants, and comparison of these predictions with experimental data provides a particularly sensitive test for the combination of potential-energy surface and transition-state theory. More rigorous tests of each of these factors depend on future developments in quantum chemistry, in studies of chemical reactions in molecular beams, and in detailed trajectory calculations of scattering processes."

https://openalex.org/W1498222752,"Abstract The fragmentation of human serum albumin by trypsin was studied by electrophoresis and by gel filtration. Brief hydrolysis at pH 8.5 yields a characteristic pattern of fragmentation, the most conspicuous feature of which is the appearance of a 51,000 mol wt fragment of distinct electrophoretic mobility. Concomitant with the formation of this fragment, an 18,500 mol wt fragment is released. In addition to this predominant pattern, a second breakdown mechanism seems to operate which yields 13,500 mol wt fragments and still smaller peptides. The yield of the 51,000 fragment per bond cleaved is pH-dependent and is maximal at pH 10. The pH dependence of this yield appears to be different from that of the alkaline transition as revealed by optical rotatory measurements. The subunit hypothesis of albumin is discussed in the light of these findings."

https://openalex.org/W1576059393,"Abstract A method was developed for the purification of a basic protein, designated as B2, derived from normal human plasma. Consecutive chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose, diethylaminoethyl sephadex, and hydroxylapatite yielded a preparation that was homogeneous on starch gel electrophoresis. The plasma protein, B2, was characterized in terms of its major physicochemical and chemical properties. The molecular weight was determined to be approximately 9000 and the s20,w0 value 1.3 S. The calculated shape of B2 corresponds to an ellipsoid of revolution with a frictional ratio of 1.25 and an axial ratio of 4:5. The isoionic and isoelectric points of this protein were found to be at approximately pH 10.7 and 10.1, respectively. At pH 8.6 the electrophoretic mobility of this blood constituent was +1.3 x 10-5 cm2 sec-1 volt-1. B2 possesses one polypeptide chain as deduced from one amino-terminal amino acid, i.e. aspartic acid (or asparagine), and one carboxyl-terminal amino acid, i.e. glycine. It is devoid of carbohydrates and is further distinguished by the lack of histidine and tryptophan. The basic nature of this protein is due to the high amide content rather than a high content of basic amino acids. Based on optical rotatory dispersion measurements B2 has α-helical structure involving about 50% of the amino acid residues."

The methods described permit the preparation of serine-specific transfer RNA in quantity, with a purity of 95% or better."
https://openalex.org/W2067608436,"Thyrocalcitonin has been suspected of containing iodine, because its analytical behavior and method of extraction are similar to that of iodinated peptides. The iodine content of increasingly pure thyrocalcitonin extracts was determined by two methods, Kolthoff's procedure and activation analysis, with good agreement. A possible link between calcium and iodine metabolism is suggested by these findings."
