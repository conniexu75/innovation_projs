https://openalex.org/W2104315543,"Drosophila melanogaster is a proven model system for many aspects of human biology. Here we present a two-hybrid-based protein-interaction map of the fly proteome. A total of 10,623 predicted transcripts were isolated and screened against standard and normalized complementary DNA libraries to produce a draft map of 7048 proteins and 20,405 interactions. A computational method of rating two-hybrid interaction confidence was developed to refine this draft map to a higher confidence map of 4679 proteins and 4780 interactions. Statistical modeling of the network showed two levels of organization: a short-range organization, presumably corresponding to multiprotein complexes, and a more global organization, presumably corresponding to intercomplex connections. The network recapitulated known pathways, extended pathways, and uncovered previously unknown pathway components. This map serves as a starting point for a systems biology modeling of multicellular organisms, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2119319172,"Activated CD8+ T cells play a critical role in host defense against viruses, intracellular microbes, and tumors. It is not clear if a key regulatory transcription factor unites the effector functions of CD8+ T cells. We now show that Eomesodermin (Eomes), a paralogue of T-bet, is induced in effector CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of Eomes was sufficient to invoke attributes of effector CD8+ T cells, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), perforin, and granzyme B. Loss-of-function analysis suggests Eomes may also be necessary for full effector differentiation of CD8+ T cells. We suggest that Eomesodermin is likely to complement the actions of T-bet and act as a key regulatory gene in the development of cell-mediated immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2008056674,"Great quantities of African dust are carried over large areas of the Atlantic and to the Caribbean during much of the year. Measurements made from 1965 to 1998 in Barbados trade winds show large interannual changes that are highly anticorrelated with rainfall in the Soudano-Sahel, a region that has suffered varying degrees of drought since 1970. Regression estimates based on long-term rainfall data suggest that dust concentrations were sharply lower during much of the 20th century before 1970, when rainfall was more normal. Because of the great sensitivity of dust emissions to climate, future changes in climate could result in large changes in emissions from African and other arid regions that, in turn, could lead to impacts on climate over large areas."
https://openalex.org/W2066478928,"A multi– high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance method is used to probe the magnetic excitations of a dimer of single-molecule magnets. The measured spectra display well-resolved quantum transitions involving coherent superposition states of both molecules. The behavior may be understood in terms of an isotropic superexchange coupling between pairs of single-molecule magnets, in analogy with several recently proposed quantum devices based on artificially fabricated quantum dots or clusters. These findings highlight the potential utility of supramolecular chemistry in the design of future quantum devices based on molecular nanomagnets."
https://openalex.org/W2154690237,"The Viking missions showed the martian soil to be lifeless and depleted in organic material and indicated the presence of one or more reactive oxidants. Here we report the presence of Mars-like soils in the extreme arid region of the Atacama Desert. Samples from this region had organic species only at trace levels and extremely low levels of culturable bacteria. Two samples from the extreme arid region were tested for DNA and none was recovered. Incubation experiments, patterned after the Viking labeled-release experiment but with separate biological and nonbiological isomers, show active decomposition of organic species in these soils by nonbiological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1546521529,"Aerosol particles are ubiquitous in Earth's atmosphere, influencing the quality of life through their climatic and health effects and by affecting visibility. In recent years, the formation and growth of nanometer-scale particles have been observed in situ in many different atmospheric environments, including urban plumes, clean Arctic air, the continental boundary layer, and coastal environments. However, as [Kulmala][1] explains in his Perspective, the mechanisms of atmospheric nucleation have not yet been resolved. An interdisciplinary approach involving laboratory experiments, continuous field observations, new theories, and dynamic models will be required to determine which mechanisms dominate in different environments.

https://openalex.org/W1980205405,"Natural variation in clock parameters is necessary for the circadian clock to contribute to organismal fitness over a broad geographic range. Considerable variation is evident in the period, phase, and amplitude of 150 Arabidopsis accessions, and the period length is correlated with the day length at the latitude of origin, implying the adaptive significance of correctly regulated circadian timing. Quantitative trait loci analysis of recombinant inbred lines indicates that multiple loci interact to determine period, phase, and amplitude. The loss-of-function analysis of each member of the ARABIDOPSIS PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR family suggests that they are candidates for clock quantitative trait loci."
https://openalex.org/W2054445281,"Heparan sulfate (HS) is required for morphogen signaling during Drosophila pattern formation, but little is known about its physiological importance in mammalian development. To define the developmental role of HS in mammalian species, we conditionally disrupted the HS-polymerizing enzyme EXT1 in the embryonic mouse brain. The EXT1-null brain exhibited patterning defects that are composites of those caused by mutations of multiple HS-binding morphogens. Furthermore, the EXT1-null brain displayed severe guidance errors in major commissural tracts, revealing a pivotal role of HS in midline axon guidance. These findings demonstrate that HS is essential for mammalian brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2096418610,"A large reservoir of bioavailable nitrogen (up to approximately 10(4) kilograms of nitrogen per hectare, as nitrate) has been previously overlooked in studies of global nitrogen distribution. The reservoir has been accumulating in subsoil zones of arid regions throughout the Holocene. Consideration of the subsoil reservoir raises estimates of vadose-zone nitrogen inventories by 14 to 71% for warm deserts and arid shrublands worldwide and by 3 to 16% globally. Subsoil nitrate accumulation indicates long-term leaching from desert soils, impelling further evaluation of nutrient dynamics in xeric ecosystems. Evidence that subsoil accumulations are readily mobilized raises concern about groundwater contamination after land-use or climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2134776666,"Here, we report evidence for the production of ozone in human disease. Signature products unique to cholesterol ozonolysis are present within atherosclerotic tissue at the time of carotid endarterectomy, suggesting that ozone production occurred during lesion development. Furthermore, advanced atherosclerotic plaques generate ozone when the leukocytes within the diseased arteries are activated in vitro. The steroids produced by cholesterol ozonolysis cause effects that are thought to be critical to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, including cytotoxicity, lipid-loading in macrophages, and deformation of the apolipoprotein B-100 secondary structure. We propose the trivial designation ""atheronals"" for this previously unrecognized class of steroids."
https://openalex.org/W2091912506,"The inner centromere-like protein (INCENP) forms a complex with the evolutionarily conserved family of Aurora Bkinases. The INCENP-Aurora complex helps coordinate chromosome segregation, spindle behavior, and cytokinesis during mitosis. INCENP-Aurora associates with kinetochores in metaphase and with spindle microtubules in anaphase, yet the trigger for this abrupt transfer is unknown. Here we show that the conserved phosphatase Cdc14 regulated the yeast INCENP-Aurora complex, Sli15-Ipl1. Cdc14 dephosphorylated Sli15 and thereby directed the complex to spindles. Activation of Cdc14 by separase was sufficient for Sli15 dephosphorylation and relocalization. Cdc14 not only regulates mitotic exit but also modulates spindle midzone assembly through Sli15-Ipl1."
https://openalex.org/W2006662979,"The etiologic agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, is capable of circumventing the immune defense of a variety of potential vertebrate hosts. Previous work has shown that interaction of host-derived complement regulators, factor H and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), with up to five complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) expressed by resistant B. burgdorferi sensu lato isolates conferred complement resistance. In addition expression of CRASP-1 is directly correlated with complement resistance of Borrelia species. This work describes the functional characterization of BbCRASP-1 as the dominant factor H and FHL-1-binding protein of B. burgdorferi. The corresponding gene, zs7.a68, is located on the linear plasmid lp54 and is different from factor H-binding Erp proteins that are encoded by genes localized on circular plasmids (cp32). Deletion mutants of BbCRASP-1 were generated, and a high affinity binding site for factor H and FHL-1 was mapped to the C terminus of BbCRASP-1. Similarly, the predominant binding site of factor H and FHL-1 was localized to the short consensus repeat 7. Factor H and FHL-1 maintain their cofactor activity for factor I-mediated C3b inactivation when bound to BbCRASP-1, and factor H is up to 6-fold more efficient in mediating C3b conversion than FHL-1. In conclusion, BbCRASP-1 (i) binds the host complement regulators factor H and FHL-1 with high affinity, (ii) is the key molecule of the complement resistance of spirochetes, and (iii) is distinct from the Erp protein family. Thus, BbCRASP-1 most likely contributes to persistence of B. burgdorferi and to pathogenesis of Lyme disease.

Thus, BbCRASP-1 most likely contributes to persistence of B. burgdorferi and to pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Lyme borreliosis is a complex multisystemic disorder caused by pathogenic species of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex and is regarded as the most frequent vector-borne infectious disease in North America and Europe (1.Steere A.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Because of the complex enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi in nature including diverse environments such as arthropod vectors and a variety of vertebrate hosts, spirochetes have developed strategies to survive in both vector and reservoir hosts. These include their ability (i) to evade an immune defense by differential expression of polymorphic outer surface proteins (2.Zhang J.R. Hardham J.M. Barbour A.G. Norris S.J.

The complement system forms an important part of the innate immunity and plays a crucial role in the elimination of invading microorganisms. Direct activation of complement via the alternative or the mannose-binding lectin pathway results in opsonization and formation of the lytic membrane attack complex leading to killing of the invading microorganisms (10.Walport M.J.

Factor H consists of 20 SCR domains; and FHL-1, an alternatively spliced variant of the factor H gene, represents the first seven SCRs of factor H and includes an extension of four hydrophobic amino acids (SFTL) at its C terminus. Both plasma proteins control the alternative pathway of complement activation at the level of C3b by competing with factor B for binding to C3b. These regulators accelerate the decay of the C3 convertase, C3bBb (decay-accelerating activity), and act as cofactors for factor I-mediated degradation of C3b (23.Pangburn M. Schreiber R.D.

The purpose of the present study was to identify and characterize BbCRASP-1, a novel outer surface protein of B. burgdorferi that is different from the Erp protein family and represents the predominant factor H- and FHL-1-binding protein. Bacterial Strains, Culture, and Materials—Intermediate complement-resistant B. burgdorferi strain ZS7 (tick isolate, Germany), infectious and pathogenic in mice, was grown at 33 °C for 5–6 days up to a cell density of 1 × 107/ml in modified Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) medium as described previously (35.Kraiczy P.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 30 min and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 5 mm MgCl2 (PBS-Mg). The density of spirochetes was determined using dark-field microscopy and a Kova counting chamber (Hycor Biomedical, Garden Grove, CA). Escherichia coli MC1061, JM109, and DH5α were grown at 37 °C in LB or 2× YT medium. Preparation and Screening of a B. burgdorferi Expression Library—A B. burgdorferi ZS7 genomic DNA expression library was prepared and screened using recombinantly expressed FHL-1 and factor H deletion constructs as described previously (35.Kraiczy P.

Briefly, bacterial colonies were plated onto LB agar plates and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Membranes were incubated with supernatant of Sf9 cells infected with FHL-1 or various recombinant deletion constructs of factor H (FH15–20, FH8–20, and FH19–20) for 12 h at 4 °C. After three washings with TBS containing 0.2% Tween 20, filters were incubated with antisera to SCR1–4 (24.Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar) and to SCR20 (VIG8) (42.Prodinger W. Hellwage J. Spruth M. Dierich M.P. Zipfel P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 31: 41-47Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), specific for factor H/FHL-1 and factor H, respectively, in the presence of 1% MC1061 cell lysate, followed by incubation with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Construction of Expression Plasmids and Purification of Recombinant Borrelial Proteins—The bbCRASP-1 gene was subcloned by PCR using plasmid pUEX15, and the amplified DNA fragment, previously named zs7.a68, was ligated in-frame into vector pGEX-2T which includes the glutathione S-transferase gene at the N terminus of the expressed recombinant fusion protein (41.Wallich R. Jahraus O. Stehle T. Tran T.T.T. Brenner C. Hofmann H. Gern L. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 708-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Expression of the GST-BbCRASP-1 fusion protein in E. coli JM109, affinity purification on glutathione-Sepharose column, and endoproteinase thrombin cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). C-terminal deletion mutants of BbCRASP-1 were constructed by PCR using the pGEX sequencing primer in combination with oligonucleotides BbCRASP-1/313(–), BbCRASP-1/490(–), BbCRASP-1/637(–), BbCRASP-1/709(–), or BbCRASP-1/709b(–), respectively. Oligonucleotides used for PCR as listed in Table I were purchased from Sigma or Roth (Mannheim, Germany). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with BamHI and ligated in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase gene into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) resulting in plasmids pGEX ZSA68/313, pGEX ZSA68/490, pGEX ZSA68/637, pGEX ZSA68/709, and pGEX ZSA68/730. Expression of the GST fusion proteins in E. coli DH5α and affinity purification were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and purity of all GST fusion proteins were confirmed by employing Tris/Tricine-SDS-PAGE (34.Kraiczy P. Skerka C. Brade V. Zipfel P.F. Infect.

The cloning of various deletion constructs, expression, and purification have been described previously (24.Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J.

DNA Sequence Analysis—B. burgdorferi genomic DNA fragments cloned in pUEX1 or pGEX-2T plasmid derivatives were sequenced by using the BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations. SDS-PAGE, Western Ligand Affinity Blots, and Western Blot—Cell lysates or purified recombinant proteins were subjected to Tris/Tricine-SDS-PAGE (reducing conditions), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the corresponding antisera as described previously (34.Kraiczy P. Skerka C. Brade V. Zipfel P.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7800-7809Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 35.Kraiczy P. Hellwage J. Skerka C. Kirschfink M. Brade V. Zipfel P.F. Wallich R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance Assays—Protein-protein interactions were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance technique using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described earlier (35.Kraiczy P. Hellwage J. Skerka C. Kirschfink M. Brade V. Zipfel P.F. Wallich R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 44.Hellwage J. Jokiranta T.S. Friese M.A. Wolk T.U.

Briefly, borrelial recombinant proteins BbCRASP-1 or C-terminal deletion mutants (BbCRASP-1-(26–244), BbCRASP-1-(26–240), BbCRASP-1-(26–166), and BbCRASP-1-(26–108)) (20 μg/ml, dialyzed against 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5) were coupled via a standard amine-coupling procedure to the flow cells of a sensor chip (CM5, Biacore AB) until a level of >4,000 resonance units was reached. A control flow cell was prepared in the same way but without injecting a protein. Factor H, FHL-1, and deletion construct FH1–6 were dialyzed against running buffer (75 mm phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4). Each ligand (factor H, 333 nm; FHL-1 and FH1–6, 1 μm) was injected separately into the flow cell coupled with BbCRASP-1 or the deletion mutants and into a control flow cell using a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 25 °C. Each interaction was analyzed at least three times. The binding kinetics were determined using a lower density of the immobilized ligand (<1,000 resonance units) at 22 °C in 75 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and employing a natural logarithmic Langmuir 1:1 binding model and the simultaneous Ka/Kd fitting routine of the BIAevaluation 3.1 software (Biacore, AB). The equilibrium constants were calculated from the rate constants. Pepspot Analysis—A library of 72 peptides, representing the entire BbCRASP-1 protein, SCR7 of factor H/FHL-1, and SCR19–20 of factor H was synthesized and spotted on a cellulose membrane (Jerini Peptide Technologies, Berlin, Germany). Each peptide was 13 amino acids in length and differed from the next peptide in 3 amino acid residues. Therefore, each peptide overlapped with the next by 10 amino acids. Membranes were incubated with recombinant proteins, and binding was detected with specific antibodies directed against the N-terminal region of factor H/FHL-1 (αSCR1–4), against the C-terminal region of factor H (αSCR19–20), or against the BbCRASP-1 protein (RH1). In Situ Protease Treatment of Spirochetes—Whole cells of B. burgdorferi strain ZS7 were treated with proteases by modification of a method described previously (45.Bunikis J. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2874-2883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly harvested cells were washed twice with PBS-MgCl, and after centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min, the sedimented spirochetes were resuspended in 100 μl of this buffer. To 1 × 107 intact borrelial cells (final volume of 0.5 ml), proteinase K in distilled water (Sigma) or trypsin in 0.001 n HCl (Sigma) were added to a final concentration of 12.5–100 μg/ml. Following incubation for 1 or 2 h at room temperature proteinase K was inhibited by adding 5 μl phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) (50 mg/ml in isopropyl alcohol) and trypsin was inhibited by adding 5 μl phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 5 μl of 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). The cells were then washed twice with PBS-Mg, resuspended in 20 μl of the same buffer, and lysed by sonication 5 times using a Branson B-12 sonifier (Heinemann, Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany). Whole-cell protein preparations (10 μl) were separated using Tris/Tricine-SDS-PAGE via 4% stacking and 10% separating gels as described previously (34.Kraiczy P. Skerka C. Brade V. Zipfel P.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7800-7809Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 35.Kraiczy P. Hellwage J. Skerka C. Kirschfink M. Brade V. Zipfel P.F. Wallich R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Functional Assay for Cofactor Activity of Factor H and FHL-1— Cofactor activity of factor H and FHL-1 was analyzed on immobilized recombinant BbCRASP-1 by measuring factor I-mediated conversion of C3b to iC3b. Briefly, recombinant BbCRASP-1 (20 μg/ml) immobilized on a microtiter plate was incubated with an excess of purified factor H, FHL-1, or of an unrelated protein (L1). After washing, bound complement regulators were incubated with a molar excess of purified C3b (Calbiochem) and purified factor I (Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C. iC3b generation was quantified by ELISA applying a neoepitope-specific mouse monoclonal anti-iC3b IgG (Quidel, San Diego, CA) as capture antibody and biotinylated rabbit anti-C3c IgG (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) as detector antibody. The reaction was visualized by the addition of streptavidin-peroxidase, followed by o-phenylenediamine/H2O2 as substrate. Purified iC3b (Calbiochem) was taken as standard. Control experiments included buffer instead of BbCRASP-1 as well as soluble and immobilized factor H or FHL-1, respectively, in the identical system. Human Sera, Rabbit Sera, and Monoclonal Antibodies—Non-immune human serum (NHS) obtained from 20 healthy human blood donors without known history of spirochetal infections was used as source for factor H. Sera that proved negative for anti-Borrelia antibodies were combined to form the NHS pool. MAb RH1 directed against BbCRASP-1 and mAb N38 1.1 directed against BbCRASP-3 were generated by immunization of Balb/c mice with purified recombinant BbCRASP-1 or BbCRASP-3 protein, respectively. Generation of mAb LA3 against Hsp70, LA22.1 against flagellin, LA27 against OspA, and LA28.1 OspB were described elsewhere (46.Kramer M.D. Schaible U.E. Wallich R. Moter S.E. Petzhold D. Simon M.M.

Nucleotide Sequence Deposition—The bbCRASP-1 gene sequence reported in this paper has been deposited in the EMBL/GenBank™ data bases under the accession number AJ430845. Identification and Cloning of the Gene Encoding BbCRASP-1 of B. burgdorferi Strain ZS7—In order to identify B. burgdorferi CRASP-1, a genomic DNA expression library derived from B. burgdorferi strain ZS7 was screened for factor H and FHL-1-binding clones. From 15 clones initially identified, one was particularly reactive with both complement regulators, factor H and FHL-1. Sequence analysis of this clone revealed that the open reading frame was identical to the zs7.a68 gene described previously (41.Wallich R. Jahraus O. Stehle T. Tran T.T.T. Brenner C. Hofmann H. Gern L. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 708-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Comparative sequence analysis showed that the zs7.a68 gene was homologous to bba68 of strain B31 (47.Fraser C.M. Casjens S. Huang W.M. Sutton G.G. Clayton R. Lathigra R. White O. Ketchum K.A.

Pulsed field gel electrophoresis demonstrated that zs7.a68 is located together with ospA/B and dbpA/B on the 54-kb linear plasmid of B. burgdorferi ZS7 (41.Wallich R. Jahraus O. Stehle T. Tran T.T.T. Brenner C. Hofmann H. Gern L. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 708-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). zs7.a68 encodes a unique protein with a calculated molecular mass of 28 kDa, and is hereafter termed BbCRASP-1. The predicted N terminus of BbCRASP-1 shows significant homology to the signal peptides of other bacterial lipoproteins. This motif includes three lysine residues near the N terminus, a hydrophobic region, and a sequence similar to the consensus signal peptidase II cleavage sequence LX(2–4)C. Subsequent lipidation at the cysteine residue 25 predicts BbCRASP-1 as an outer surface lipoprotein of B. burgdorferi (Fig. 1).

https://openalex.org/W2004415585,"The hSNF5 chromatin-remodeling factor is a tumor suppressor that is inactivated in malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs). A number of studies have shown that hSNF5 re-expression blocks MRT cell proliferation. However, the pathway through which hSNF5 acts remains unknown. To address this question, we generated MRT-derived cell lines in which restoration of hSNF5 expression leads to an accumulation in G0/G1, induces cellular senescence and increased apoptosis. Following hSNF5 expression, we observed transcriptional activation of the tumor suppressor p16INK4a but not of p14ARF, repression of several cyclins and CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein implicated in metastasis. Chromatin immunoprecipitations indicated that hSNF5 activates p16INK4a transcription and CD44 down-regulation by mediating recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex. Thus, hSNF5 acts as a dualistic co-regulator that, depending on the promoter context, can either mediate activation or repression. Three lines of evidence established that p16INK4a is an essential effector of hSNF5-induced cell cycle arrest. 1) Overexpression of p16INK4a mimics the effect of hSNF5 induction and leads to cellular senescence. 2) Expression of a p16INK4a-insensitive form of CDK4 obstructs hSNF5-induced cell cycle arrest. 3) Inhibition of p16INK4a activation by siRNA blocks hSNF5-mediated cellular senescence. Collectively, these results indicate that in human MRT cells, the p16INK4a/pRb, rather than the p14ARF/p53 pathway, mediates hSNF5-induced cellular senescence.

The genesis of most human cancers requires disabling of the p53 or retinoblastoma protein (pRb) 1The abbreviations used are: pRbretinoblastoma proteinIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingDAPI4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation assayMRTsmalignant rhabdoid tumorsCMVcytomegalovirus. tumor suppressor pathways, which form the primary cell-autonomous defense against unrestrained proliferation (1Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Google Scholar). The activities of these two pathways are modulated by p14ARF and p16INK4a, two structurally unrelated proteins encoded by a single locus (2Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol.

These two tumor suppressors act through distinct mechanisms. Whereas p16INK4a modulates pRb activity, p14ARF regulates p53 function. pRb is a corepressor that binds several E2F family transcription factors to silence a host of genes required for cell cycle advancement from G1 to S-phase. In the presence of growth-promoting signals, the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex phosphorylates pRb, causing its dissociation from E2F. This in turn allows activation of E2F responsive genes, driving cell cycle progression into S-phase. p16INK4a regulates pRb through inhibition of the cyclin D1-CDK4 kinase activity, thus keeping pRb in its active antiproliferative state. The second tumor suppressor encoded by the INK4a/ARF locus, p14ARF, binds HDM2 to prevent p53 degradation.

ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors (remodelers) play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during cellular differentiation and development (5Mahmoudi T. Verrijzer C.P.

Consequently, aberrant gene control due to mutations in chromatin-regulating enzymes can lead to tumor formation (7Klochendler-Yeivin A. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 73-79Google Scholar). The multiprotein SWI/SNF complex is the prototypical remodeler, present in all eukaryotes (8Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev.

SWI/SNF utilizes the energy derived from ATP-hydrolysis by its SWI2/SNF2-related ATPase subunit to alter nucleosome structure. Human SWI/SNF complexes (hSWI/SNF or BRM/BRG1-associated factor (BAF) complex) contain either BRM or BRG1, the two SWI2/SNF2p homologues present in human cells. Several studies have implicated misregulation of SWI/SNF in the development of human cancers (7Klochendler-Yeivin A. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 73-79Google Scholar). The central BRG1/BRM ATPases are mutated in multiple human tumor cell lines and their loss correlates with poor prognosis of non-small cell lung cancers (12Wong A.K. Shanahan F. Chen Y. Lian L. Ha P.

These rare cancers of early childhood have a grim prognosis and very high lethality. hSNF5 mutations were also found associated with a number of other neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia, choroid plexus carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and central primitive neurectodermal tumors (24Sevenet N.

Carriers are predisposed to various cancers, including MRTs and tumors of the central nervous system (23Biegel J.A. Zhou J.Y. Rorke L.B. Stenstrom C. Wainwright L.M. Fogelgren B.

In a large proportion of these tumors, the wild-type allele is either lost or deleted, consistent with a classic tumor suppressor phenotype. SNF5 is a universal SWI/SNF component, conserved from yeast to man. SNF5 is a direct target for several distinct DNA-binding regulators (28Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P.

Gene inactivation studies in mice revealed that, while homozygous SNF5-null mice die very early during embryogenesis, heterozygous mice survive but are prone to soft tissue tumors (33Guidi C.J. Sands A.T. Zambrowicz B.P. Turner T.K. Demers D.A. Webster W. Smith T.W. Imbalzano A.N. Jones S.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3598-3603Google Scholar, 34Klochendler-Yeivin A. Fiette L. Barra J.

A. 2000; 97: 13796-13800Google Scholar). The loss of the remaining SNF5 allele in these tumors strongly suggests that SNF5 functions as a tumor suppressor. Likewise, mice with mono-allelic BRG1 expression are predisposed to tumors, reinforcing the role of SWI/SNF in neoplasia (36Bultman S. Gebuhr T. Yee D. La Mantia C. Nicholson J. Gilliam A. Randazzo F. Metzger D. Chambon P. Crabtree G. Magnuson T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1287-1295Google Scholar). Utilizing a reversibly inactivating conditional allele, Orkin and co-workers (37Roberts C.W. Leroux M.M. Fleming M.D. Orkin S.H. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 415-425Google Scholar) showed that loss of SNF5 function resulted in a highly penetrant and extremely short latency development of cancers, in particular lymphomas or rhabdoid tumors. Their elegant approach, which circumvents the critical requirement for SNF5 during development, highlighted its essential tumor suppression function. This study, however, also uncovered the requirement of SNF5 for survival of most normal, nonmalignant cells. However, when particular additional mutations are present, loss of SNF5 may trigger tumor progression. The human pediatric cancers and the mouse gene inactivation studies have firmly established SNF5 as a novel tumor suppressor. Moreover, during the course of the present study, a number of reports showed that hSNF5 re-expression blocks MRT cell proliferation (38Betz B.L. Strobeck M.W. Reisman D.N. Knudsen E.S. Weissman B.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5193-5203Google Scholar, 39Ae K. Kobayashi N. Sakuma R. Ogata T. Kuroda H. Kawaguchi N. Shinomiya K. Kitamura Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3112-3120Google Scholar, 40Zhang Z.K.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6403-6412Google Scholar). These studies revealed a G1 cell cycle arrest upon re-expression of hSNF5 in MRT cells. These distinct studies emphasized different targets. Factors reported to be affected by hSNF5 expression include several cyclins, p16INK4a, and pRb. However, the central question, which of these factors is a critical mediator of hSNF5-induced arrest, remained unsolved. To address this issue, we have generated MRT-derived cell lines, which inducibly express hSNF5. We found that hSNF5 induction leads to a G1 cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. We demonstrate that the transcriptional activation of the tumor suppressor p16INK4a, but not of p14ARF, plays a pivotal role in this hSNF5-induced proliferative block. Chromatin immunoprecipitations indicated that the p16INK4a promoter is an hSNF5-dependent, direct target of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. We directly tested the importance of p16INK4a activity for the hSNF5-induced cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Three different approaches, involving p16INK4a overexpression, the use of a p16INK4a-insensitive CDK4 and p16INK4a small interfering RNA duplex (siRNA) knockdown, revealed that p16INK4a is both necessary and sufficient to mediate hSNF5-dependent cellular senescence. We conclude that in human MRT cells, the p16INK4a-cyclin D1/CDK4-pRb pathway, rather than the p14ARF-HDM2-p53 pathway, is indispensable for hSNF5 tumor suppressor function. Cell Procedures—Stable cell lines were generated using the LacSwitch™ II system (Stratagene). First pCMVLac1 followed by either pOPRSVI or pOPRSVI-hSNF5-FLAG, generated with a PCR-based strategy, encoding hSNF5 with a C-terminal FLAG epitope, were stably integrated in G401 MRT cells. FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used for transfections. The resulting Lac-Empty or Lac-hSNF5 lines were isolated and most experiments were repeated using independent lines. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 500 μg/ml G418, 100 μg/ml Hygromycin (Invitrogen), and, when added, 5 mm IPTG. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 100% methanol, followed by standard indirect immunofluorescence. Apoptotic cells were identified on the second day following hSNF5 induction by immunofluorescence using rabbit polyclonal 9541 (Cell signaling) antibodies directed against cleaved PARP and mouse monoclonal 6H2.B4 (BD Pharmingen 65971A) antibodies against cytochrome c. Nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining. To determine proliferation curves, 1.5 × 105 cells were plated in triplicate into 5 cm dishes. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested and counted. For colony formation, cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 103 cells per 9-cm dish. After 7-11 days, cells were fixed with methanol/acetic acid and stained with Giemsa. BrdUrd incorporation was measured according to the manufacturers instructions (BrdUrd labeling and detection kit I, Roche Applied Science). Flow cytometric analyses were typically performed after 3-5 days according to standard procedures (42Knaan-Shanzer S. Valerio D. van Beusechem V.W. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 323-333Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to which 0.5 ml of ice-cold 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (pH 7.2) containing 160 μg/ml l-α-lysophophatidylcholine (Lysolecithin, Sigma) was added dropwise under constant swirling. The cell suspension was kept on ice for 5 min after which the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin containing 8 μg/ml 7AAD (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated in darkness for at least 30 min at room temperature prior to analysis on a FACSort flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Typically, at least 10,000 events per sample were acquired, and data were analyzed using CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences, Immunocytometry Systems, San José, CA). Senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining was performed as described (43Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Google Scholar). Lentivirus Production and Transduction—Details of the lentiviral transfer vectors used in this study will be published elsewhere. Briefly, pRRLcpptpgkmcspreSin (44Zufferey R. Dull T. Mandel R.J. Bukovsky A. Quiroz D. Naldini L. Trono D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9873-9880Google Scholar) was adapted by insertion of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of encephalomyocarditis virus within its polylinker. The enhanced form GFP (eGFP) coding sequence was cloned directly downstream of the IRES to yield pLVbcG. cDNA sequences corresponding to wild-type CDK4 and CDK4(R24C) (45Rane S.G. Cosenza S.C. Mettus R.V. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 644-656Google Scholar) were cloned upstream of the IRES to generate pCDK4bcG and pCDK4(R24C)bcG, respectively. Replication-incompetent self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviruses, pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVg) were generated in 293T cells (44Zufferey R. Dull T. Mandel R.J. Bukovsky A. Quiroz D. Naldini L. Trono D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9873-9880Google Scholar). Briefly, the expression vectors for HIV Gag/Pol, HIV Rev, and VSVg and the viral transfer vector were co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Next day, the medium was changed and the supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size filter and stored at -80 °C. The virus titer was estimated by determining HIV p24gag protein by HIV-1 p24 antigen ELISA (ZeptoMetrix Corporation, NY). For transductions 5 × 104 Lac-hSNF5 cells were seeded in 10-cm-diameter dishes and incubated overnight with 50 ng of virus in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. Next day, the medium was changed, and 2 days after transduction, the cells were harvested, seeded, and induced with IPTG for growth curves, colony-forming assays or FACS analysis. FACS sorting for eGFP expression revealed a 70-90% transduction efficiency. siRNA Knockdown of p16INK4a—The siRNA duplex oligonucleotides (sense: 5′-CGCACCGAAUAGUUACGGUTT-3′; antisense: 5′-ACCGUAACUAUUCGGUGCGTT-3′) corresponding to positions 93-111-bp downstream of the p16INK4a ATG initiation codon to which 2 additional Ts were added. 20 μm RNA oligonucleotide stocks were prepared in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl. The solution was incubated for 2 min at 95 °C and then allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. For transfection, 3 × 104 Lac-hSNF5 cells per well were seeded in 6-well plates containing 1 ml of media. 1-h prior transfection, Lac-hSNF5 cells were induced by addition of IPTG. For each well, 10 μl of oligonucleotide stock (20 μm) was diluted into 175 μl of Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). Next, 4 μl of Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted in serum-free Opti-MEM media by gentle mixing and following a 10 min incubation added to the oligonucleotide solution, mixed gently, and incubated at room temperature for 15-20 min. Next, 200 μl of the solution was added to each well. Cells were incubated 4 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of 2 ml of fresh media either lacking or containing IPTG. The transfection was repeated every 72-96 h for a maximum of three consecutive transfections. At the indicated time points, cells were collected for different assays performed as described above. Protein and mRNA Expression Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% NaDOC, 0.1% SDS), assayed for protein concentration, and 15 μg (45 μg for p14ARF blot) of extract was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting.

Enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection of proteins. For immunoprecipitations, cell extracts were prepared 48 h after IPTG addition in HEMG buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 0.1 m EDTA pH 8.0, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 150 or 400 mm NaCl). Protein lysates were incubated with antibodies followed by addition of either protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Bound proteins were washed extensively and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. For RT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels, cells were harvested 48 h after IPTG addition, total RNA was extracted with RNAzol (Campro Scientific), and cDNA was prepared using random hexamers and Superscript™ II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR amplification was performed using the Advantage® PCR Kit (Clontech) and the following primers: p16INK4a, ATGGAGCCGGCGGCGGGGAGC and TCAATCGGGGATGTCTGA; p14ARF, GTTTTCGTGGTTCACATCCC and ACCAGCGTGTCCAGGAAG; p21Cip1, ATGTCAGAACCGGCTGGGGAT and TTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGGAGAA; cycl.

Promoter Assays and Chromatin Immunoprecipitations—Cells were plated and transfected with the appropriate reporter plasmid and pCDNA-lacZ control plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 12 h later, IPTG was added and after 24 or 48 h, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as described (48Mahmoudi T. Katsani K.R. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1775-1781Google Scholar). The following reporter plasmids were used: p16(-869)-luc (49Hara E. Smith R. Parry D. Tahara H. Stone S. Peters G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Google Scholar), p14(-800)-luc (50Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Google Scholar). Cross-linked chromatin was prepared from cells harvested 48 h after IPTG addition and sheared to an average length of 0.6 kb. After immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Ac-H3 (Upstate Biotechnology 06-599), BRG1, hSNF5 or FLAG-M2 (Sigma). The recovered DNA was analyzed by PCR with primers corresponding to the p16INK4a promoter, AGGAGCCCAGTCCTCCTT and CGGTATCTTTCCAGGCAA; p14ARF promoter, GCTGCCTGGAGTTGCGTT and AAGATCTCGGAACGGCTC; or CD44 promoter, CCGTGCTCTGCTGAGGCTGTA and GAAACCCAGAGATCTTGCTCC. Products were resolved on a 2.0% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Expression of hSNF5 in MRT Cells Blocks Cell Proliferation and Induces Senescence—The aim of our study was to elucidate the pathway controlled by hSNF5 whose disruption causes tumorigenic transformation of MRT cells. Therefore, we reintroduced the hSNF5 gene under control of the Lac repressor-operator system. We established “Lac-hSNF5” cells derived from G401 MRT parental cells. These cells lack the hSNF5 gene but express wild-type p53 and pRb. In Lac-hSNF5 cells, the expression of hSNF5, tagged with a C-terminal FLAG epitope, is under the control of the lac operator and can be induced by addition of IPTG. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that, while there is no detectable hSNF5 in the absence of IPTG, in its presence, hSNF5 is induced and localizes to the nucleus (Fig. 1A). The level of hSNF5 in Lac-hSNF5 cells upon induction with IPTG is comparable or even less than that observed in other cell lines, as established by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). Because hSNF5 functions as a component of the SWI/SNF complex, we tested its association with BAF155, BAF170, and BRG1 (Fig. 1C). BRG1 is the only human SWI2/SNF2p homologue expressed in G401 cells (data not shown). In extracts prepared from IPTG-induced cells, hSNF5 was found associated with immunoprecipitated BRG1 and, conversely, BRG1, BAF155, and BAF170 were present in hSNF5-FLAG immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C). The anti-FLAG beads did not immunoprecipitate BRG1, BAF155 or BAF170 in the absence of IPTG or in extracts prepared from the Lac-empty control cell line. In summary, we have generated an MRT-derived cell line in which hSNF5 expression can be tightly controlled. The induced hSNF5 appropriately localizes in the nucleus and associates with a BRG1-containing SWI/SNF complex. Our establishment of the Lac-hSNF5 cells allowed us to assess the role of hSNF5 in the control of cell proliferation. First, we determined the growth curves of these cells in the presence of serum. Notably, like the parental G401 cells, un-induced Lac-hSNF5 cells can proliferate in the absence of serum (data not shown). We found that hSNF5 induction dramatically impaired cell proliferation, even when cultured in the presence of 10% serum (Fig. 2A). In contrast, addition of IPTG had no effect on Lac-empty control cells lacking the hSNF5 gene. Similar results were obtained with independently isolated Lac-hSNF5 cell lines (data not shown). We also assessed the effect of hSNF5 on the colony-forming capacity of Lac-hSNF5 cells, and found that hSNF5 expression dramatically reduced the number of colonies formed, after seeding these cells at a very low density (Fig. 2B). We next determined which stage of the cell cycle is affected by hSNF5. As shown in Fig. 2C, expression of hSNF5 leads to impaired DNA synthesis, indicated by the strongly reduced incorporation of BrdUrd. FACS analysis revealed that the hSNF5-expressing cells accumulate in G1, suggesting that the cell cycle block affects entry into S-phase (Fig. 2D). The difference in percentage of gated cells at a given stage of the cell cycle in cells expressing hSNF5 versus uninduced cells is shown in Fig. 2E. Finally, we found that a large proportion of the hSNF5-expressing cells displayed the characteristic features of cellular senescence, including an enlarged, flat cell morphology and the presence of activated acidic β-galactosidase (Fig. 2F). We also examined the effect of hSNF5 induction on apoptosis. There was a clear increase in the number of apoptotic cells, from less than 1% to more than 5%, following hSNF5 expression, as determined by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, the presence of the caspase 3 substrate cleaved PARP and a DAPI staining characteristic for apoptotic cells (Fig. 2G). Because, at least in these cells, the induction of cell cycle arrest appears to be the major cause of the proliferative block, we decided to focus on the role of hSNF5 in cell cycle control rather than apoptosis. In conclusion, our results, and those of others (38Betz B.L. Strobeck M.W. Reisman D.N. Knudsen E.S. Weissman B.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5193-5203Google Scholar, 39Ae K. Kobayashi N. Sakuma R. Ogata T.

However, the mechanism through which hSNF exerts its antiproliferative function remained unknown. hSNF5 Activates p16INK4a, but Not p14ARF Expression—To delineate the pathway by which hSNF5 expression can reverse a tumor cell phenotype, we sought to identify effectors of cell cycle arrest and senescence that are activated by hSNF5. Since the INK4a/ARF locus is believed to play a prominent role in these processes, we first analyzed the expression"
https://openalex.org/W2060495746,"Many antiviral drugs (e.g. fialuridine; FIAU) produce clinically significant mitochondrial toxicity that limits their dose or prevents their use in the clinic. Because the majority of nucleoside drugs is too hydrophilic to cross the highly impermeable mitochondrial membrane, we have hypothesized that they must be transported into the mitochondria to produce their toxicity. To test this hypothesis, we have sought to determine whether the nucleoside transporters, human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) or human concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hCNT1), when stably expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as yellow fluorescent fusion protein (YFP), are localized to the mitochondria. By using organelle-selective dyes and confocal microscopy, we have found that hENT1-YFP is localized to the mitochondria as well as the plasma membrane, whereas hCNT1-YFP was found predominantly on the plasma membrane. hENT1-YFP was not localized to the nuclear envelope, endosomes, lysosomes, or Golgi complex. Western blotting confirmed the presence of hENT1-YFP or endogenous hENT1 in mitochondria isolated from hENT1-YFP-expressing cells and human livers, respectively. In agreement with these localization data, [14C]FIAU was efficiently transported into the mitochondria of cells expressing hENT1-YFP but not of cells expressing hCNT1-YFP. The mitochondrial toxicity of FIAU to Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was enhanced by hENT1-YFP, even when hENT1 activity on the plasma membrane was selectively blocked by 10 nm nitrobenzylthioinosine. Moreover, FIAU (50 μm) produced significant mitochondrial toxicity (∼70% decrease in mitochondrial DNA synthesis) when it was directly incubated with mitochondria isolated from hENT1-expressing cells. In conclusion, we have identified for the first time that hENT1 is expressed on the mitochondrial membrane and that this expression enhances the mitochondrial toxicity of nucleoside drugs such as FIAU. Mitochondrial expression of hENTs may explain the clinically significant mitochondrial toxicity caused by the anti-HIV nucleoside drugs such as zidovudine, stavudine, and didanosine.

In a phase II trial, administration of this antiviral nucleoside to patients with hepatitis B resulted in severe multisystem toxicity because of widespread mitochondrial damage including hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, neuropathy, or myopathy. Of the seven patients exhibiting severe hepatotoxicity, five died and two survived after liver transplantation (1McKenzie R. Fried M.W. Sallie R. Conjeevaram H. Di Bisceglie A.M. Park Y. Savarese B.

If phosphorylated in the cytosol, the hydrophilic nucleotides may be transported across the mitochondrial membrane by either the ADP/ATP translocator (11Dolce V. Fiermonte G. Runswick M.J.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4620-4625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the nucleosides, which are mostly hydrophilic, must be transported across the highly impermeable mitochondrial membrane and then be phosphorylated to the nucleotides in the mitochondrial compartment (13Barile M. Valenti D. Passarella S. Quagliariello E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Camins A. Jimenez A. Sureda F.X. Pallas M. Escubedo E. Camarasa J.

Pharmacol. 2000; 398: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we report studies that demonstrate for the first time that one of these nucleoside transporters is the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1). By using confocal microscopy, our studies show that hENT1, fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; hENT1-YFP), is localized to the mitochondrial compartment in MDCK cells expressing hENT1-YFP. Mitochondria isolated from these cells demonstrate hENT1 activity and efficiently transport labeled uridine or FIAU. Moreover, we show that the mitochondrial expression of hENT1-YFP in MDCK cells results in enhanced mitochondrial toxicity of FIAU even when hENT1-YFP activity in the plasma membrane is blocked by a low nanomolar concentration of NBMPR, a potent hENT1 inhibitor. These studies demonstrate for the first time that the intracellular localization of hENT1 has important consequences for intracellular disposition and mitochondrial toxicity of nucleoside drugs. hENT1 or hCNT1 genes were subcloned into yellow fluorescence vector pEYFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting constructs, hENT1-YFP or hCNT1-YFP, were transfected into the MDCK cell line to produce a stable cell line as described previously (16Lai Y. Bakken A.H. Unadkat J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37711-37717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely maintained in minimum Eagle's medium with l-glutamine containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 with 95% humidity. Mitochondria were isolated from human liver or cells using the mitochondria isolation kit (Sigma). Human liver tissue was procured, prepared, and stored as described previously (17Hickman D. Wang J. Wang Y. Unadkat J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 207-215PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rettie A.E. Eddy A.C. Heimark L.D. Gibaldi M. Trager W.F. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1989; 17: 265-270PubMed Google Scholar). Liver tissue (100 mg) or 1–5 × 108 cells (pooled from 8 to 10 dishes) were homogenized on ice with 2 ml of the manufacturer's extraction buffer using a Teflon-glass homogenizer. As recommended by the vendor, to obtain a more purified “heavy” mitochondrial fraction, the low and high speed centrifugation steps listed in the kit were modified to three rounds of 1,000 and 3,500 × g, respectively. This modification reduced the contamination from lysosomes and peroxisomes. The integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane was determined by measuring the potential gradient across the mitochondrial membrane using the fluorescent stain, JC-1, as per the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma) (19Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Stable expressing cells or their mitochondria were suspended and fine-needle homogenized in cell lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Liver tissue (100 mg) was homogenized with lysis buffer using a Teflon-glass homogenizer and then sonicated on ice three times for 15 s separated by 30-s intervals. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. An aliquot (15 μl) of the resulting supernatant (10 μg protein) was boiled for 5 min with an equal volume of Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad). The boiled samples were then run on 4–15% gradient SDS gel (Bio-Rad) and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was washed and incubated with an anti-green fluorescent protein monoclonal antibody (for hENT1-YFP-expressing cell, JL-8 Clontech), or hENT1 antibody (for human liver) (20Ward J.L. Sherali A. Mo Z.P. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8375-8381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) or a Na+-K+-ATPase antibody (Sigma). Bound antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody and visualized by the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). MitroTracker Red 580, Golgi complex dye (N-((4-(4,4-difluoro-5-(2-thienyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-yl)phenoxy)acetyl)sphingosine ceramide), LysoTracker, and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The undifferentiated cells were grown on Lab-Tek Borosilicated Coverglass Chambers (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Naperville, IL) for 2 days. All cells were stained with DAPI (nuclei) and one of the intracellular organelle stains. Golgi complexes were stained by incubating with N-((4-(4,4-difluoro-5-(2-thienyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diazas-indacene-3-yl)phenoxy)acetyl)sphingosine ceramide (5 μm) for 30 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria and lysosomes were stained by incubating with MitoTracker-580 (100 nm) for 45 min or LysoTracker (300 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C, respectively. After incubation, the cells were rinsed several times with Hanks' balanced salt solution/HEPES containing 5 μm BSA to remove the excess dye. Endosomes were identified by immunolocalization. Briefly, the fixed cells were pretreated with 2% Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocked by 10% normal horse serum for 2 h. Then the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:50 mouse monoclonal early endosome antigen 1 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington KY). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and reacted with 1:250 anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa-560 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 2 h. Finally, the cell chromosomes were stained with DAPI (300 nm) for 5 min. The cells were observed and photographed by Leica confocal microscope equipped with a 2-photon and a krypton/argon laser as the light source. The DAPI-stained nuclei images were captured by excitation at 360 nm and emission at 440–460 nm. The YFP images were captured by excitation at 488 nm and emission at 520–540 nm. The lysosome, endosome, mitochondria, and Golgi complex stains were imaged by excitation at 580 nm and emission at 600–640 nm. All transport experiments were carried out in triplicate in sodium-containing transport buffer (Tris-HCl 20 mm, K2HPO4 3 mm, MgCl2·6H2O 1 mm, CaCl2 2 mm, glucose 5 mm, NaCl 130 mm, pH 7.4) or sodium-free transport buffer in which NaCl was replaced by 130 mmN-methyl-d-glucamine, pH 7.4. To determine transport into the mitochondria, the mitochondria (0.1 mg of protein) were incubated with 0.2 μm [3H]uridine (Moravek Chemicals) in a sodium-containing or sodium-free buffer, each containing 10 μm NBMPR (hCNT1 activity), or in a sodium-free buffer with or without 10 nm, 1 μm, or 10 μm NBMPR (hENT1/2 activity) (16Lai Y. Bakken A.H. Unadkat J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37711-37717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An equal concentration of Me2SO (a solvent used to dissolve NBMPR) was included in all experiments. After incubating at 37 °C for 10 min, nucleoside transport by the mitochondria was rapidly terminated by filtration followed by washing the filtered mitochondria three times with ice-cold Na+-free buffer containing 10 μm NBMPR. The mitochondria, retained on the filter, were solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and then counted on a scintillation counter. To determine whether FIAU is transported by hCNT1 or hENT1, mitochondria from cells expressing these transporters were incubated for 10 min with 1 μCi of [14C]FIAU (8 μm) as described above. Transport of labeled uridine or FIAU into MDCK cells (expressing empty vector (mock), hENT1-YFP, or hCNT1-YFP), was determined as described before (16Lai Y. Bakken A.H. Unadkat J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37711-37717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine the inhibition of hENT1-mediated [3H]uridine transport into MDCK cells by FIAU or raluridine, MDCK cells were incubated for 10 min with [3H]uridine (2 μCi/ml, 1 μm) in the presence of FIAU or raluridine (50 or 500 μm) in a sodium-free transporter buffer. MTT Assay—103 cells were grown on 48-well cell culture plates. During the logarithmic phase of cell growth, FIAU or raluridine (0, 50, 100, 200, or 500 μm) was added to the cell culture medium for 4 days. Then the cells were washed and incubated for 4 h with MTT (5 mg/ml) dissolved in a Hanks' balanced salt solution. Then 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (isopropyl alcohol containing 10% Triton X-100 and 0.1 n HCl) was added to dissolve the formazan formed. 100 μl of the resulting formazan solution was transferred into a 96-well plate, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm in a microplate spectrophotometer. Mitochondrial toxicity was evaluated as the formazan formed by cells incubated with FIAU or raluridine compared with that by control cells. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Release Assay—The cell culture medium was collected at regular intervals in the above MTT assay. Cell debris in the medium was removed by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min. LDH released into the culture medium was measured by determining the absorbance at 490 nm using a NAD-linked assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Freshly prepared mitochondria (∼1 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in a medium with or without FIAU (50 μm) and containing mitochondrial energy requirements and DNA synthesis components as described before (21Banki K. Anders M.W. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). [3H]dTTP (2 μCi/ml, 79.6 Ci/mmol) was used as nucleic acid precursor. After 3 h of incubation, the mitochondria were precipitated by ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, filtered, and then washed three times with trichloroacetic acid. The acid-precipitable radioactivity was quantified by a liquid scintillation counter. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of triplicate experiments. Data shown are representative of a minimum of two experiments carried out on different days on different batches of cells. Expression of hENT1-YFP in Undifferentiated MDCK Cells—Previously, when we simultaneously expressed hENT1 and hCNT1 in undifferentiated MDCK cells, we noted that hENT1-YFP (but not hCNT1-CFP) was found on the plasma membrane as well as discrete clusters within the cells (16Lai Y. Bakken A.H. Unadkat J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37711-37717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Others have also reported that hENT1 is also found intracellularly (22Mangravite L.M. Xiao G. Giacomini K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F902-F910Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine the localization of these observed hENT1-YFP clusters, we expressed hENT1-YFP or hCNT1-YFP in MDCK cells. These stable expressing cells, stained with organelle-selective dyes or antibodies, were examined using the confocal microscope. As expected, besides plasma membrane expression, hENT1-YFP was localized intracellularly (Fig. 1), whereas hCNT1-YFP was not (data not shown). By using the organelle-selective markers, we found that the intracellular localization of hENT1-YFP, both in the x-y and the z plane, overlapped with the mitochondria (Fig. 1, D and H) but not with the nuclear envelope, early endosomes (Fig. 1, A and E), Golgi complex (Fig. 1, B and F), or lysosomes (Fig. 1, C and G). Western Blotting of Mitochondria hENT1-YFP—To confirm mitochondrial localization of hENT1, mitochondria isolated from hENT1-YFP-expressing cells were examined for the presence of hENT1 by Western blotting. To do so, we first confirmed the lack of contamination of the mitochondrial fraction, by plasma membrane, by the minimal presence of Na+-K+-ATPase (Fig. 2A). Na+-K+-ATPase was present in abundance in the cell homogenates of both hENT1-YFP- and empty vector-expressing MDCK cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the mitochondrial fraction isolated from these cells showed minimal presence of this plasma membrane marker (Fig. 2A). When the mitochondrial fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE, hENT1-YFP (∼67 kDa, Fig. 2B) was present at comparable levels in the mitochondrial fraction and the homogenate from MDCK cells expressing hENT1-YFP, but not in cell homogenate or the mitochondrial fraction of mock cells (Fig. 2B). To confirm that hENT1 is physiologically expressed in mitochondria of human livers, we determined its presence there by Western blotting. As expected, hENT1 (∼40 kDa, Fig. 2C) was expressed in mitochondria isolated from human livers. Integrity of the Isolated Mitochondria—To confirm the integrity of the isolated mitochondria, we measured the mitochondria membrane potential, using the mitochondria membrane potentially sensitive lipophilic cationic dye JC-1, as described before (19Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 23Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). An ∼30-fold accumulation of JC-1 (fluorescent units) in the isolated mitochondrial fraction, over that obtained with the cell homogenate, indicated that the isolated mitochondrial fraction was enriched in intact mitochondria. [3H]Uridine Transport and Inhibition—To determine whether hENT1-YFP expressed in the mitochondria was functional, we measured the transport of [3H]uridine over 10 min into the intact mitochondria in the presence or absence of the hENT1 inhibitor, NBMPR (10 μm). Preliminary studies showed that the uptake of [3H]uridine into the mitochondria was linear over 10 min. Mitochondria from hENT1-YFP-expressing cells showed about 4-fold greater hENT1 activity when compared with those isolated from hCNT1 or mock cells. The latter two cell types demonstrated some endogenous hENT-like transport activity that was inhibited by NBMPR (10 μm) (Fig. 3A). Further characterization of this endogenous hENT-like activity showed that it was also completely inhibited by 10 nm NBMPR indicating that it was an hENT1-like transporter (Fig. 3B). Previously, we have also shown that MDCK cells exhibit low level endogenous hENT-like activity (16Lai Y. Bakken A.H. Unadkat J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37711-37717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mitochondria isolated from human liver tissue also exhibited hENT-like [3H]uridine transport (Fig. 3C). This transport was sensitive to NBMPR at as low a concentration as 10 nm (Fig. 3C). Because hENT1 is completely inhibited by 10 nm NBMPR, the differences in transport of [3H]uridine in the presence of 10 nm and 10 μm NBMPR likely represents endogenous hENT2 activity. In contrast, mitochondria isolated from hCNT1 or mock-expressing cells showed no sodium-dependent transport activity (data not shown). To ascertain if FIAU or raluridine are potential substrates of hENT1, we measured the ability of these two nucleoside analogs to inhibit the hENT1-mediated transport of [3H]uridine (Fig. 4A). FIAU was found to be a potent inhibitor of [3H]uridine transport (Fig. 4B). In contrast, raluridine is only a modest inhibitor even at the high concentration of 500 μm (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that, unlike FIAU, raluridine is unlikely to be a high affinity substrate of hENT1. [14C]FIAU Transport by MDCK Cells and Their Mitochondria—To confirm that FIAU, a potent mitochondrial toxin, is indeed a substrate of hENT1, we measured the transport of [14C]FIAU (1 μCi, 8 μm) into cells expressing hENT1-YFP, hCNT1-YFP, or mock cells. [14C]FIAU is an excellent substrate of hENT1 but not of hCNT1 as shown by the significant inhibition of FIAU transport by NBMPR (Fig. 5A) but not by the absence of sodium (data not shown). As expected, [14C]FIAU transport into mitochondria of hENT1-YFP-expressing cells was significantly greater than that into mitochondria of mock cells (Fig. 5B). To allow comparison of these data with uridine uptake data (Fig. 3), the values have been adjusted to reflect the uptake that would be observed at 0.2 μm FIAU. Mitochondrial Toxicity of FIAU and Raluridine as Measured by the MTT and LDH Assay—Because we found that FIAU is an excellent substrate of hENT1, we compared its mitochondrial toxicity with that of raluridine, in hENT1-YFP-expressing cells. As measured by the MTT and the LDH release assay, FIAU, but not raluridine, produced significant mitochondrial toxicity when incubated with hENT1-YFP-expressing cells (Fig. 6, A and B). This observed mitochondrial toxicity of FIAU was greater in hENT1-YFP-expressing cells when compared with that in mock cells (Fig. 7). Mock cells exhibited some FIAU mitochondrial toxicity, most likely due to the transport of FIAU into the MDCK cells by the endogenous canine hENT-like transporter. To eliminate the presence of hENT1 on the plasma membrane from contributing to the enhanced mitochondrial toxicity of FIAU, we measured the toxicity of FIAU (plus tracer [14C]FIAU) when hENT1 activity on the plasma membrane was inhibited by low nanomolar (10 nm) concentrations of NBMPR. hENT1-YFP-expressing cells incubated with 50 μm FIAU showed mitochondrial toxicity that was significantly greater than that of mock cells, even though plasma membrane hENT1 activity was inhibited by 10 nm NBMPR (Fig. 7, A and B). We confirmed the latter by measuring the intracellular radioactivity contents of [14C]FIAU at 96 h. At this time, the intracellular [14C]FIAU content was similar in both hENT1-YFP- and mock cells (7.12 ± 1.54 versus 8.29 ± 2.14 pmol/mg protein/96 h).Fig. 7In the absence of NBMPR, as determined by MTT (A)or LDH release (B) assay over 96 h, FIAU is a mitochondrial toxin toward hENT1-YFP-expressing cells and mock cells. In contrast, when NBMPR (10 nm) is used to block hENT1-YFP activity on the plasma membrane, FIAU is a mitochondrial toxin toward only hENT1-YFP-expressing cells but not toward mock cells.

Quinones, a wide group of natural substances, human drugs, and environmental pollutants may act either as TrxR substrates or inhibitors. Here we systematically analyzed the interactions of TrxR with different classes of quinone compounds. We found that TrxR catalyzed mixed single- and two-electron reduction of quinones, involving both the selenium-containing motif and a second redox center, presumably FAD. Compared with other related pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases such as glutathione reductase or trypanothione reductase, the kcat/Km value for quinone reduction by TrxR was about 1 order of magnitude higher, and it was not directly related to the one-electron reduction potential of the quinones. A number of quinones were reduced about as efficiently as the natural substrate thioredoxin. We show that TrxR mainly cycles between the four-electron reduced (EH4) and two-electron reduced (EH2) states in quinone reduction. The redox potential of the EH2/EH4 couple of TrxR calculated according to the Haldane relationship with NADPH/NADP+ was –0.294 V at pH 7.0. Antitumor aziridinylbenzoquinones and daunorubicin were poor substrates and almost inactive as reversible TrxR inhibitors. However, phenanthrene quinone was a potent inhibitor (approximate Ki = 6.3 ± 1 μm). As with other flavoenzymes, quinones could confer superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase activity to mammalian TrxR. A unique feature of this enzyme was, however, the fact that upon selenocysteine-targeted covalent modification, which inactivates its normal activity, reduction of some quinones was not affected, whereas that of others was severely impaired. We conclude that interactions with TrxR may play a considerable role in the complex mechanisms underlying the diverse biological effects of quinones.

Low Mr (34-kDa subunit) TrxRs of prokaryotes, plants, or yeast contain FAD and a redox-active disulfide/dithiol active site and display narrow substrate specificities. High Mr (54–58 kDa) TrxRs of animals have in contrast remarkably wide substrate specificities, explained by an additional easily accessible C-terminal redox center. This redox center is either a disulfide/dithiol as in TrxR of Plasmodium falciparum or Drosophila melanogaster or a selenocysteine-containing selenenylsulfide/selenolthiol motif as found in TrxRs of mammals (3.Bauer H.

In recent years, the catalytic mechanism of mammalian TrxR has been unraveled in significant detail. The three-dimensional crystal structure of rat TrxR is similar to that of glutathione reductase, including conserved FAD and NADP(H)-binding domains, but TrxR has a 16-residue C-terminal extension carrying the catalytic Cys-497/Sec-498 couple that in essence substitutes for glutathione as a substrate of the N-terminally located active site disulfide/dithiol motif (7.Sandalova T. Zhong L. Lindqvist Y. Holmgren A. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9533-9538Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In the catalytic cycle of mammalian TrxR, NADPH first reduces FAD, which subsequently passes redox equivalents to the redox-active disulfide with formation of a dithiol, located within a conserved -CVNVGC-sequence. Finally, this dithiol reduces the selenenylsulfide formed by the Cys and Sec residues in a -GCUG sequence located at the C-terminal end of the other subunit in the dimeric enzyme (5.Zhong L.

The so-formed selenolthiol is the proper active site of mammalian TrxR, reducing Trx or other substrates such as lipoic acid, ascorbic acid, or the synthetic model substrate, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (9.Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Maines M. Costa L. Reed D. Sassa S. Current Protocols in Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 7.4.1-7.4.14Google Scholar). Consecutive reduction of the three redox-active motifs of mammalian TrxR, i.e. the FAD, the N-terminal disulfide, and the C-terminal selenenylsulfide, gives two-, four-, and six-electron reduced states of the enzyme, with specific spectral properties that are well characterized (5.Zhong L.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It is believed that during normal catalysis, mammalian TrxR cycles between the two- and four-electron reduced states with the two or four electrons shared mainly between the catalytic disulfide and the selenenylsulfide (5.Zhong L. Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5854-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The disulfide/dithiol motif also forms a charge transfer complex with the FAD (8.Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr, C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Recently, this mechanism was demonstrated also for D. melanogaster TrxR where, however, a dithiol motif substitutes for the role of the selenolthiol in the mammalian enzyme (3.Bauer H. Massey V.

Many factors make mammalian TrxR an important target of drugs and xenobiotics, as recently reviewed (10.Becker K. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Müller S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6118-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The broad substrate specificity of mammalian TrxR is expected to provide antioxidant function at several levels, coupled to reduction of cytosolic lipoate, selenium compounds, hydroperoxides, and ubiquinone-10 (see Refs. 11.Zhao R.

Another important antioxidant system that would suffer from TrxR inhibition is that of the mammalian peroxiredoxins, which all require functional Trx for regeneration (16.Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cytokine functions of extracellular Trx, as well as increased Trx and TrxR levels in some tumor cell lines and in synovial fluid or tissue of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (10.Becker K.

Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 2430-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), argue for targeting of TrxR as a possible therapeutic approach in certain diseases. In fact, TrxR is inactivated by several compounds in clinical use, including 1,3-bis-(2-chloro-ethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) (18.Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), anticancer platinum compounds (19.Arnér E.S.J. Nakamura H. Sasada T. Yodoi J. Holmgren A. Spyrou G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), antiarthritic gold compounds (20.Smith A.D. Guidry C.A. Morris V.C. Levander O.A. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10835-10842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Modification of TrxR by dinitrohalobenzenes yields covalently linked dinitrophenyl groups that seem to act as mediators between the enzyme-bound FAD and oxygen, thus enhancing the superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase activity of TrxR, while inhibiting the normal function of the enzyme (22.Nordberg J. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Arnér E.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10835-10842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This may play a role in the provoked inflammation seen upon topical application of dinitrohalobenzenes on skin, as discussed elsewhere (2.Nordberg J. Arnér E.S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar). Quinones are a widespread group of oxygen-substituted, often biologically active, aromatic compounds. They are found as naturally occurring substances, as synthetic drugs for clinical use, or as components of environmental pollutants. The antitumor, cytotoxic, and antiparasitic activities of clinically used quinones are mainly believed to stem from effects due to redox cycling of their free radical or hydroquinone states, derived from reduction by flavoenzymes, or from covalent modifications of DNA and other cellular nucleophiles (see Refs. 23.Wardman P. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 739-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 24.O'Brien P.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1991; 80: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 25.Hargreaves R.H.J. Hartley J.A. Butler J. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Reduction of quinones by pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductases related to TrxR, i.e. glutathione reductase, lipoamide dehydrogenase, and trypanothione reductase, has been studied in significant detail (26.Cenas N.K. Arscott D. Williams Jr., C.H. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2509-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27.Cenas N.K. Rakauskiene G.A. Kulys J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28.Vienozinskis J. Butkus A. Cenas N. Kulys J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The interactions with quinones may also concomitantly inhibit the normal reactions of these enzymes (29.Salmon-Chemin L. Buisine E. Yardley V. Kohler S. Debreu M.A. Landry V. Sergheraert C. Croft S.L. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Davioud-Charvet E. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 548-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Previously, studies of mammalian TrxR regarding interactions with quinones include the demonstrated reduction of ubiquinone-10, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, and alloxan (14.Xia L. Nordman T. Olsson J.M. Damdimopoulos A. Bjorkhem-Bergman L. Nalvarte I. Eriksson L.C. Arner E.S. Spyrou G. Bjornstedt M. J. Biol.

A. 1980; 77: 5149-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Inactivation of reduced TrxR by antitumor aziridinylbenzoquinones and anthracyclines has also been reported (31.Mau B.-L. Powis G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, no systematic analysis of the reactions of quinones with mammalian TrxR has yet been performed. Here we examined the interactions of recombinant rat TrxR (32.Arnér E.S.J. Sarioglu H. Lottspeich F. Holmgren A. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) with a number of structurally diverse quinones, including aziridinylbenzoquinones DZQ, RH1, MeDZQ, BZQ (25.Hargreaves R.H.J. Hartley J.A. Butler J. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), anthracycline daunorubicin (Fig. 1), and a number of model compounds for both partially and fully substituted quinones. We show that significant quinone reduction seems to occur not at the FAD but at the selenolthiol motif, which is unique in comparison to the quinone reduction by non-selenoprotein pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases. Furthermore, we show that certain specific quinone compounds, e.g. juglone, may bypass this selenolthiol motif yet be efficiently reduced by the enzyme. Finally, we show that the four-electron reduced form of TrxR participates in the quinone reduction, and we have determined the previously unknown redox potential of the enzyme. Enzymes and Proteins—Recombinant rat TrxR1 was essentially prepared as described (32.Arnér E.S.J. Sarioglu H. Lottspeich F. Holmgren A. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), with slight methodological improvements to be reported elsewhere. The enzyme was pure as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE and had a specific activity of 22 units/mg in the model DTNB assay (9.Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Maines M. Costa L. Reed D. Sassa S. Current Protocols in Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 7.4.1-7.4.14Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration was determined from the absorbance of FAD, ϵ463 = 11.3 mm–1 cm–1 (8.Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr, C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Chlamydomonas reinhardtii thioredoxin was prepared as described (33.Jacquot J.P. Rivera M.R. Marinho P. Kollarova M. Le M.E.P. Miginiac M.M. Meyer Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1357-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined using ϵ280 = 10.9 mm–1 cm–1 (34.Gonzalez Porque P. Baldesten A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2363-2370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reagents—NADPH, NADP+, cytochrome c, superoxide dismutase, catalase, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), dithiothreitol (DTT), gold thioglucose, and BCNU were obtained from Sigma and were used without additional purification. Daunorubicin was obtained from Reakhim (Russia); 2-methyl-3-glutathionyl-5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was a generous gift of Dr. Karin Ölinger (Linköping University, Sweden). 2,5-Diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DZQ), 2,5-diaziridinyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (RH1), 2,5-dimethyl-3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone (MeDZQ), and BZQ were synthesized according to established procedures (35.Winski S.L. Hargreaves R.H. Butler J. Ross D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 3083-3088PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Chou F. Khan A.H. Driscoll J.S. J. Med. Chem. 1976; 19: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 37.Petersen S. Gauss W. Kiehne H. Juhling L. Z. Krebsforsch. 1969; 72: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and their purity was checked by melting point, elemental analysis, and IR and NMR spectra. Other quinones were obtained from Sigma and used without additional purification. Experimental Procedures—All experiments were carried out in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), containing 1 mm EDTA, at 25 °C. Rapid reaction studies were performed using a DX.17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics) under aerobic conditions. Steady-state reaction rates were monitored spectrophotometrically, using a Hitachi-557 spectrophotometer. Typically, 10–100 μm NADPH was used, and the rate of DTNB reduction (0.15–1.5 mm) by TrxR was monitored following the increase in absorbance at 412 nm (Δϵ412 = 13.6 mm–1 cm–1), considering that one molecule of DTNB (and NADPH) produces two TNB anions (9.Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Maines M. Costa L. Reed D. Sassa S. Current Protocols in Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 7.4.1-7.4.14Google Scholar). Steady-state NADPH-quinone reductase activity of TrxR was monitored following the rate of NADPH oxidation (Δϵ340 = 6.2 mm–1 cm–1) using 100 μm NADPH. In separate experiments, 50 μm cytochrome c was added into the reaction mixture, and its quinone-mediated reduction was monitored at 550 nm (Δϵ550 = 20 mm–1 cm–1). The reaction rate was corrected for the background (direct) reduction of cytochrome c by TrxR. In separate experiments, this was found to be 0.33 mol of cytochrome c reduced per s per mol TrxR subunit under the utilized assay conditions. When C. reinhardtii Trx (10–80 μm) was the electron acceptor, reaction rates were monitored by following NADPH oxidation. In the reverse reaction of TrxR, reduction of NADP+ (50–500 μm) was monitored at 340 nm in the presence of Trx (10–80 μm) and 8 mm DTT as reducing agent (38.Bironaite D. Anusevicius Z. Jacquot J.P. Cenas N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This activity was corrected for the background reaction (direct reduction of NADP+ by TrxR in the presence of 8 mm DTT but in the absence of Trx), which was 0.2 mol NADP+/s/mol subunit. The kinetic parameters of reactions, i.e. the catalytic constant (kcat) and the bimolecular rate constant (kcat/Km), correspond to the reciprocal intercepts and slopes of the Lineweaver-Burk plots, [E]/v versus 1/[S], where v is reaction rate, [E] and [S] are the enzyme and substrate concentrations, respectively. The kcat corresponds to molecules of NADPH oxidized (or NADP+ reduced) by enzyme-active site/s, i.e. the dimeric TrxR holoenzyme has twice the activity. The TrxR inhibition experiments were performed in two ways. In studies of reversible inhibition, substrates and inhibitor were introduced into the spectrophotometer cell first, at which point reaction was started by TrxR addition. The inhibition constants were calculated from Cleland plots, plotting the dependence of reciprocal kcat/Km values at variable substrate versus inhibitor concentration (Ki(slopes)), or the dependence of plot intercept with y axis versus inhibitor concentration (Ki(intercepts)). In the irreversible inhibition experiments, TrxR (0.6–6.0 μm) was incubated in the presence of NADPH (200 μm) and inhibitor at 25 °C. After incubation for the indicated period, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was introduced into a spectrophotometer cell (with a 100–200-fold factor of dilution), and the rate of DTNB reduction was monitored in the presence of 50 μm NADPH and 1.5 mm DTNB. Alternatively, quinone reductase activity of TrxR was monitored by following the oxidation rate of 50 μm NADPH in the presence of quinone. Reactions of TrxR with Disulfide Substrates—Before analysis of quinone reduction catalyzed by the recombinant mammalian TrxR preparation used throughout this study, we probed its reduction of the two model disulfide substrates DTNB and Trx. As reported before (21.Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams C.H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20096-20101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), at fixed NADPH concentrations (6–60 μm) and varied DTNB (0.15–1.5 mm), the Lineweaver-Burk plots showed a series of parallel lines, thus pointing to a “ping-pong” scheme (data not shown). The same ping-pong patterns were observed using C. reinhardtii Trx instead of DTNB as substrate (oxidant). The catalytic constants (kcat) and the steady-state bimolecular rate constants of oxidative and reductive half-reactions (kcat/Km) as determined here are given in Table I. The kcat values of both reactions were marginally lower than those catalyzed by native purified mammalian TrxR using DTNB (4000 min–1 for dimeric native TrxR, i.e. 33 s–1 per active site) or mammalian (3300 min–1; 27.5 s–1) and E. coli (3000 min–1; 25 s–1) Trx, as summarized from the literature (9.Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Maines M. Costa L. Reed D. Sassa S. Current Protocols in Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 7.4.1-7.4.14Google Scholar). It can be noted that C. reinhardtii Trx with Km = 19 μm was a slightly more efficient oxidant for the recombinant enzyme than E. coli Trx with Km = 35 μm for native mammalian TrxR (9.Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Maines M. Costa L. Reed D. Sassa S. Current Protocols in Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 7.4.1-7.4.14Google Scholar), which in the latter case gives kcat/Km = 0.714 μm–1 s–1 to be compared with 1.06 μm–1 s–1 for C. reinhardtii Trx found here (Table I). We also assessed the reverse reaction of TrxR, i.e. reduction of NADP+ by C. reinhardtii reduced Trx utilizing 8 mm DTT as reducing agent. This reaction also followed ping-pong kinetics (data not shown) with a kcat close to that of the forward reaction (see Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of recombinant mammalian TrxR in reactions with thioredoxin or DTNB at pH 7.0 and 25 °CReductantOxidantkcatkcat/KmReductantOxidants-1μm-1 s-1NADPHDTNB20.6 ± 0.33.42 ± 0.150.145 ± 0.015NADPHC. reinhardtii Trx-S220.0 ± 1.03.05 ± 0.201.06 ± 0.10C. reinhardtii Trx-(SH)2NADP+16.5 ± 1.02.18 ± 0.150.415 ± 0.025 Open table in a new tab By using the data presented in Table I, the redox potential of TrxR can be calculated. According to the Haldane relationship, the ratio of the bimolecular rate constants of forward and reverse reactions gives the equilibrium constant of the reaction (K), which in turn is related to the difference in the standard redox potential of the reactants (ΔE07 = 29.5 mV × log K for a two-electron transfer). This relation, based on the rates of enzyme reactions with NADP(H) (E07 = –0.320 V), has been used for calculating E07 of yeast (39.Rakauskiene G.A. Cenas N.K. Kulys J.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and P. falciparum glutathione reductases (40.Bohme C.C. Arscott L.D. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Williams Jr, C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37317-37323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For Reaction 1, the ratio of kcat/Km for NADPH oxidation and NADP+ reduction (Table I) gives K = 8.07 ± 0.5, and E07 of TrxR, –0.294 ± 0.003 V. NADPH+TrxROX↔NADP++TrxRred(Eq. 1) Alternatively, for Reaction 2, the ratio of kcat/Km for reduced and oxidized Trx (Table I) Trx-(SH)2+TrxROX↔Trx-S2+TrxRred(Eq. 2) gives K = 2.04 ± 0.2. Because the E07 of C. reinhardtii Trx has been determined to be –0.290 ± 0.01 V (41.Krimm I. Lemaire S. Ruelland E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Jaquot J.P. Hirasawa M. Knaff D.B. Lancelin J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), this would give E07 of TrxR of –0.281 ± 0.01 V, in good agreement with the value obtained using NADP(H). We next analyzed the effect of NADP+ on the NADPH-dependent reduction of DTNB by TrxR. At fixed concentrations of DTNB and varied NADPH, the reaction product NADP+ acted as a mixed inhibitor with respect to NADPH, increasing both slopes and intercepts in Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 2A). The same mixed inhibition pattern was observed using fixed NADPH and varied DTNB concentrations (Fig. 2B). At [NADPH] = 150 μm, the Ki of NADP+ determined according to the slopes of Lineweaver-Burk plots (Ki(slopes)) was equal to 270 ± 40 μm, whereas the Ki value determined according to the plot intercepts with the y axis (Ki(intercepts)) was equal to 1200 ± 200 μm. This inhibition of TrxR by NADP+ may possibly play a physiological role in cases of decreased intracellular NADPH/NADP+ ratios, e.g. in hepatocytes upon ethanol intoxication (42.Akinshola B.E. Potter J.J. Mezey E. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 509-514PubMed Google Scholar). Quinone Reduction by TrxR—Pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductases like lipoamide dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and trypanothione reductase, as well as low Mr-type TrxR of Arabidopsis thaliana, perform mixed single- and two-electron reduction of quinones with reactivity typically increasing with an increase in the single-electron reduction potential (E17) of the quinone substrate (26.Cenas N.K.

https://openalex.org/W2031331113,"Cytochrome c oxidase contains two redox-active copper centers (CuA and CuB) and two redox-active heme A moieties. Assembly of the enzyme relies on several assembly factors in addition to the constituent subunits and prosthetic groups. We studied fibroblast cultures from patients carrying mutations in the assembly factors COX10, SCO1, or SURF1. COX10 is involved in heme A biosynthesis. SCO1 is required for formation of the CuA center. The function of SURF1 is unknown. Immunoblot analysis of native gels demonstrated severely decreased levels of holoenzyme in the patient cultures compared with controls. In addition, the blots revealed the presence of five subassemblies: three subassemblies involving the core subunit MTCO1 but apparently no other subunits; a subassembly containing subunits MTCO1, COX4, and COX5A; and a subassembly containing at least subunits MTCO1, MTCO2, MTCO3, COX4, and COX5A. As some of the subassemblies correspond to known assembly intermediates of human cytochrome c oxidase, we think that these subassemblies are probably assembly intermediates that accumulate in patient cells. The MTCO1·COX4·COX5A subassembly was not detected in COX10-deficient cells, which suggests that heme A incorporation into MTCO1 occurs prior to association of MTCO1 with COX4 and COX5A. SCO1-deficient cells contained accumulated levels of the MTCO1·COX4·COX5A subassembly, suggesting that MTCO2 associates with the MTCO1·COX4·COX5A subassembly after the CuA center of MTCO2 is formed. Assembly in SURF1-deficient cells appears to stall at the same stage as in SCO1-deficient cells, pointing to a role for SURF1 in promoting the association of MTCO2 with the MTCO1·COX4·COX5A subassembly. Cytochrome c oxidase contains two redox-active copper centers (CuA and CuB) and two redox-active heme A moieties. Assembly of the enzyme relies on several assembly factors in addition to the constituent subunits and prosthetic groups. We studied fibroblast cultures from patients carrying mutations in the assembly factors COX10, SCO1, or SURF1. COX10 is involved in heme A biosynthesis. SCO1 is required for formation of the CuA center. The function of SURF1 is unknown. Immunoblot analysis of native gels demonstrated severely decreased levels of holoenzyme in the patient cultures compared with controls. In addition, the blots revealed the presence of five subassemblies: three subassemblies involving the core subunit MTCO1 but apparently no other subunits; a subassembly containing subunits MTCO1, COX4, and COX5A; and a subassembly containing at least subunits MTCO1, MTCO2, MTCO3, COX4, and COX5A. As some of the subassemblies correspond to known assembly intermediates of human cytochrome c oxidase, we think that these subassemblies are probably assembly intermediates that accumulate in patient cells. The MTCO1·COX4·COX5A subassembly was not detected in COX10-deficient cells, which suggests that heme A incorporation into MTCO1 occurs prior to association of MTCO1 with COX4 and COX5A. SCO1-deficient cells contained accumulated levels of the MTCO1·COX4·COX5A subassembly, suggesting that MTCO2 associates with the MTCO1·COX4·COX5A subassembly after the CuA center of MTCO2 is formed. Assembly in SURF1-deficient cells appears to stall at the same stage as in SCO1-deficient cells, pointing to a role for SURF1 in promoting the association of MTCO2 with the MTCO1·COX4·COX5A subassembly. Cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) belongs to the superfamily of terminal oxidases present in all aerobic organisms (1Calhoun M.W. Thomas J.W. Gennis R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 325-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, cytochrome c oxidase is embedded as a dimer in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Electron transfer by the enzyme from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen is coupled to proton pumping across the membrane, contributing to the mitochondrial membrane potential. The redox centers involved in electron transfer are two copper centers (CuA and CuB) and two heme A moieties (a and a3) (2Michel H. Behr J. Harrenga A. Kannt A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 329-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic enzyme contains three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunits: MTCO1, MTCO2, and MTCO3. These subunits are homologous to polypeptides found in bacterial cytochrome c oxidases (3Saraste M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 331-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). They form both the catalytic and structural core of the enzyme (4Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic interior of MTCO1 coordinates the heme a group and a binuclear center composed of heme a3 and CuB. The intermembrane space domain of MTCO2 coordinates the binuclear CuA center (4Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). In addition to the three mtDNA-encoded subunits, mammalian cytochrome c oxidase contains 10 nuclear DNA-encoded subunits: COX4, COX5A, COX5B, COX6A, COX6B, COX6C, COX7A, COX7B, COX7C, and COX8. In humans, COX6A and COX7A exist as skeletal/cardiac muscle (COX6A2 and COX7A1) and ubiquitously expressed (COX6A1 and COX7A2) isoforms (5Taanman J.-W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although not confirmed at the protein level, human isoforms of COX4, COX6B, and COX8 have also been identified (6Hüttemann M. Kadenbach B. Grossman L.I. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 267: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 7Hüttemann M. Schmidt T.R. Grossman L.I.

Although significant progress has been made concerning the structure and catalysis of cytochrome c oxidase (2Michel H. Behr J. Harrenga A. Kannt A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 329-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), the assembly of the mammalian enzyme has remained relatively unexplored. Studies in yeast have indicated that assembly is dependent on numerous nuclearly encoded proteins in addition to the constituent subunits and prosthetic groups (9Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rötig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Human homologues for a number of these assembly factors have been identified, and some are known to be involved in disease (9Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rötig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the presence of subassemblies of cytochrome c oxidase in fibroblast cultures from patients harboring mutations in the assembly factors SURF1, SCO1, or COX10 to learn more about assembly mechanism of the human enzyme. SURF1 resides in the mitochondrial inner membrane (11Tiranti V. Galimberti C. Nijtmans L. Bovolenta S. Perini M.P. Zeviani M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2533-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Yao J. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2541-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mutations in the SURF1 gene are a relatively common cause of mitochondrial disease (13Zhu Z. Yao J. Johns T. Fu K. De B.I. Macmillan C. Cuthbert A.P. Newbold R.F. Wang J. Chevrette M. Brown G.K.

Nearly all reported patients carry mutations that introduce premature termination codons, resulting in loss of expression. Absence of SURF1 or its yeast homologue, Shy1p, causes a severe deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase but does not completely abolish enzyme activity in patients (13Zhu Z. Yao J. Johns T. Fu K. De B.I.

Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This suggests that the protein has a redundant function. The precise role of SURF1 is, however, unknown. SCO1 and SCO2 are the human members of the SCO family of proteins that appear to be widely distributed in aerobic organisms (18Papadopoulou L.C. Sue C.M. Davidson M.M. Tanji K. Nishino I.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Like SURF1, SCO1 and SCO2 are mitochondrial inner membrane proteins (21Paret C. Ostermann K. Krause-Buchholz U. Rentzsch A. Rödel G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rödel G. Mol. Gen.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). SCO proteins have a conserved CXXXC motif protruding into the intermembrane space, similar to the CXXXC motif present at the CuA site of MTCO2 (24Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Studies of the yeast SCO protein Sco1p have indicated that the protein binds one Cu+ ion, ligated via the cysteine residues present in the CXXXC motif and a conserved histidine residue (25Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The Bacillus subtilis SCO protein YpmQ is required for the biosynthesis of cytochrome c oxidase but not for the alternative terminal oxidase, menaquinol oxidase, which only contains a CuB site (19Mattatall N.R. Jazairi J. Hill B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28802-28809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This observation together with mutation and co-immunoprecipitation studies in yeast (26Dickinson E.K. Adams D.L. Schon E.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26780-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Lode A. Kuschel M. Paret C. Rödel G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) C+ suggest that SCO proteins transfer copper to the CuA site. An unrelated Cu+-binding protein, COX11, appears to be involved in the provision of copper to the CuB site (28Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 29Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol.

Mutations in SCO2 have been reported in several unrelated patients (18Papadopoulou L.C. Sue C.M. Davidson M.M. Tanji K. Nishino I. Sadlock J.E. Krishna S. Walker W. Selby J. Glerum D.M. Coster R.V.

Neurology. 2001; 57: 1440-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but only a single family with SCO1 mutations has been described (32Valnot I. Osmond S. Gigarel N. Mehaye B. Amiel J. Cormier-Daire V. Munnich A. Bonnefont J.P. Rustin P. Rotig A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 1104-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The patients from this family carried a frameshift mutation on one allele, introducing a premature termination codon, and a missense mutation on the other allele, resulting in a proline to leucine replacement immediately adjacent to the CXXXC motif. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was markedly decreased in patient tissues, but there was still some residual activity, suggesting that the amino acid substitution does not completely eliminate SCO1 function. COX10 is a farnesyltransferase that catalyzes the conversion of heme B (ferric protoporphyrin IX) to heme O (33Saiki K. Mogi T. Ogura K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26041-26044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). Heme O is subsequently converted into heme A in a biosynthetic pathway involving COX15 (35Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). COX10 and COX15 are considered constituents of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Studies in yeast have indicated that both proteins are necessary for cytochrome c oxidase biosynthesis (36Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Glerum D.M. Muroff I. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19088-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Three families with COX10 gene mutations have been documented (38Valnot I. Kleist-Retzow J.C. Barrientos A. Gorbatyuk M. Taanman J.W. Mehaye B. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Munnich A. Rotig A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1245-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 39Antonicka H. Leary S.C.

Patients were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for missense mutations, changing evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues. Their tissues retained some residual cytochrome c oxidase activity, suggesting that the mutated farnesyltransferase was still partially active. Consistent with this view, mutated human COX10 was able to complement the respiratory defect of a yeast cox10 null mutant when present on a high copy plasmid but, unlike wild-type human COX10, not when present on a low copy plasmid (38Valnot I. Kleist-Retzow J.C. Barrientos A. Gorbatyuk M. Taanman J.W. Mehaye B. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Munnich A. Rotig A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1245-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The fibroblast cultures which we investigated were derived from four unrelated patients with SURF1 mutations (40Williams S.L. Taanman J.W. Hansíková H. Houšt'kovát H. Chowdhury S. Zeman J.

Quantitative immunoblot analysis of native gels revealed residual levels of fully assembled enzyme in all cultures but also some accumulation of subassemblies. The subunit composition of the subassemblies identified in the patient cells provides insights into the temporal positioning of MTCO1, COX4, and COX5A assembly, heme A insertion, and formation of the CuA center within the assembly pathway of human cytochrome c oxidase. Cell Cultures—Fibroblasts were grown from explant cultures of skin biopsies derived from four infants carrying SURF1 mutations (P1–4), one infant carrying SCO1 mutations, one infant carrying a COX10 mutation, and four pediatric controls. All patients harboring SURF1 mutations suffered from Leigh syndrome and died at <4 years of age (40Williams S.L. Taanman J.W. Hansíková H. Houšt'kovát H. Chowdhury S. Zeman J. Houštěk J. Mol.

Informed parental consent, in accordance with the guidelines of the participating institutions, was obtained for all biopsies. The A549 human lung carcinoma cell line was obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK). The cell line was depleted of its mtDNA by long term exposure to ethidium bromide to yield cell line A549 ρ0 (42King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured under standard conditions in medium supplemented with 110 mg/ml sodium pyruvate and 50 μg/ml uridine (43Taanman J.W. Muddle J.R. Muntau A.C. Hum. Mol.

Preparation of Mitoplasts and Mitochondria—Mitoplast-enriched pellets were prepared from fibroblasts as described (44Klement P. Nijtmans L.G. Van den Bogert C. Houštěk J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), using a solution of 4 mg/ml digitonin. Mitoplasts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion-selective channel; HSP, heat shock protein. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation of digitonin-treated, homogenized cells (45Bourgeron T. Chretien D. Rötig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Samples were stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce). Enzyme Activity Assays—Cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase activities of mitochondrial preparations were measured spectrophotometrically essentially as described (46Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-11Crossref Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 47Wharton D.C. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-250Crossref Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Each reported value is the mean of 4–6 independent measurements. Histochemical staining for cytochrome c oxidase activity in native gels was performed as described previously (48Zerbetto E.

Immunoblot Analysis—Gel electrophoresis and blotting was carried out with the Mini Protean® 3 System (Bio-Rad). For immunoblot analysis of one-dimensional denaturing gels, mitochondrial fractions were dissociated in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 6.8), 12% glycerol, 4% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue for 30 min at 37 °C and resolved on either 7.5, 12.5, or 15% polyacrylamide, 0.1% SDS, 5.5 m urea gels run according to Laemmli (53Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar).

For immunoblot analysis of two-dimensional native/denaturing gels, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside-solubilized mitochondrial fractions were first separated on blue native 8–16% polyacrylamide gels, followed by separation of single sample lanes on 13.5% polyacrylamide, 0.1% SDS, 5.5 m urea gels. First dimension gel lanes were soaked in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol for 15 min, followed by two 10-min soaks in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS. Gel strips were mounted horizontally in the Mini Protean® 3 System, and second dimension gels were poured around them, with a 3% polyacrylamide stacking gel surrounding the first dimension gel strip. Proteins were electrotransferred from the gels onto Immobilon™-P poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) (56Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. Taanman J.-W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 260: 117-132Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Blots were air-dried overnight, rinsed three times with methanol to remove residual dye, rinsed once with PBS, and incubated in PBS, 10% nonfat dry milk for 1 h to saturate protein-binding sites. Subsequently, blots were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS, 0.3% Tween 20 for 2 h. After three 10-min washes in PBS, 0.3% Tween 20, blots were incubated with either rabbit anti-mouse (Dakocytomation, Ely, UK) or goat anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad) IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 1 h. To enhance detection, blots of two-dimensional gels were washed twice in PBS, 0.3% Tween 20, and incubated with a peroxidase-labeled anti-peroxidase mouse monoclonal antibody (Dakocytomation) for 1 h. All blots were washed three times in PBS, 0.3% Tween 20 and twice in PBS. Immunoreactive material was visualized by chemiluminescence (Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Exposures of films to the blots were chosen such that signals of the patient samples were within the linear range of the diluted control samples. Signals were quantified using the NIH Scion Image application. All blotting experiments were repeated with independently isolated mitochondrial samples. Duplicate experiments yielded consistent results. Purification of MTCO1—Human heart cytochrome c oxidase was a kind gift of Dr. A. O. Muijsers (University of Amsterdam). The enzyme was dissociated in 3% SDS, and subunits were resolved under denaturing conditions on a Bio-Gel® P-60 (Bio-Rad) gel filtration column (57Steffens G. Buse G. Hoppe Seylers. Z. Physiol. Chem. 1976; 357: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To remove excess of SDS, MTCO1 was precipitated by addition of 3 volumes of ethanol at room temperature. The protein pellet was washed with 80% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in PBS, 0.1% SDS.

https://openalex.org/W2113857833,"Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), and the C4H redox partner cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) are important in allocating significant amounts of carbon from phenylalanine into phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in plants. It has been proposed that multienzyme complexes (MECs) containing PAL and C4H are functionally important at this entry point into phenylpropanoid metabolism. To evaluate the MEC model, two poplar PAL isoforms presumed to be involved in either flavonoid (<i>PAL2</i>) or in lignin biosynthesis (<i>PAL4</i>) were independently expressed together with C4H and CPR in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, creating two yeast strains expressing either PAL2, C4H and CPR or PAL4, C4H and CPR. When [<sup>3</sup>H]Phe was fed, the majority of metabolized [<sup>3</sup>H]Phe was incorporated into <i>p</i>-[<sup>3</sup>H]coumarate, and Phe metabolism was highly reduced by inhibiting C4H activity. PAL alone expressers metabolized very little phenylalanine into cinnamic acid. To test for intermediate channeling between PAL and C4H, we fed [<sup>3</sup>H]Phe and [<sup>14</sup>C]cinnamate simultaneously to the triple expressers, but found no evidence for channeling of the endogenously synthesized [<sup>3</sup>H]cinnamate into <i>p</i>-coumarate. Therefore, efficient carbon flux from Phe to <i>p</i>-coumarate via reactions catalyzed by PAL and C4H does not appear to require channeling through a MEC in yeast, and instead biochemical coupling of PAL and C4H is sufficient to drive carbon flux into the phenylpropanoid pathway. This may be the primary mechanism by which carbon allocation into phenylpropanoid metabolism is controlled in plants."

Amyloidosis represents a group of disorders in which endogenous proteins or peptides adopt anomalous folds and aggregate into elongated amyloid fibrils. At least 20 different human disease conditions are associated with protein deposits, of which Alzheimer's disease and prion-associated disorders are among the most well known examples (1Sipe J.D. Cohen A.S. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Because the macroscopic properties of amyloid, in terms of aggregation and solubility, prevent the use of single crystal x-ray crystallography, as well as solution NMR spectroscopy, the atomic resolution of the molecular structure of amyloid fibrils is poorly understood. So far, structural information has mainly arisen from fiber diffraction studies (2Kirschner D.A. Abraham C. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), cryoelectron microscopy (3Jimenez J.L. Guijarro J.I. Orlova E. Zurdo J. Dobson C.M. Sunde M. Saibil H.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), mass spectrometry (4Kheterpal I. Zhou S. Cook K.D. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

From these data a general picture has emerged implying the occurrence of parallel or antiparallel β-sheets, in which the β-strands lie perpendicular to the direction of the long fibril axis. Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy is a hereditary form of amyloidosis caused by one of more than 70 different single point mutations in the 13.7-kDa human plasma protein transthyretin (TTR) 1The abbreviations used are: TTRtransthyretinAFMatomic force microscopyBMEβ-mercaptoethanolddeuteratedDTTdithiothreitolH/Dhydrogen/deuteriumHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence.1The abbreviations used are: TTRtransthyretinAFMatomic force microscopyBMEβ-mercaptoethanolddeuteratedDTTdithiothreitolH/Dhydrogen/deuteriumHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence. (6Connors L.H. Richardson A.M. Theberge R. Costello C.E. Amyloid. 2000; 7: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The clinical manifestation of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy is predominantly peripheral polyneuropathy, affecting motor, sensory, and autonomic functions, with accumulation of amyloid deposits along the peripheral nerves and within the visceral organs. The TTR wild-type protein can also form amyloid in vivo and is associated with a senile form of disease affecting around 25% of the population above 80 years of age (7Westermark P. Sletten K. Johansson B. Cornwell III, G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2843-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The native fold of TTR has long since been established through x-ray diffraction studies (8Blake C.C. Burridge J.M. Oatley S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1978; 6: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and these show that native TTR adopts a tetrameric arrangement, where each monomeric subunit contains eight β-strands, denoted A–H, arranged in a characteristic sandwich of two four-stranded β-sheets (DAGH and CBEF). Two monomeric subunits are associated via F-F′ and H-H′ interactions to form a dimer that in turn interacts in a face-to-face manner with another dimer to form the tetramer. Crystal structures of several in vivo identified amyloidogenic mutants of TTR have been determined over the years. However, they show only subtle and minor variations in their three-dimensional structure compared with the native structure of wild-type TTR (9Hornberg A. Eneqvist T. Olofsson A. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). transthyretin atomic force microscopy β-mercaptoethanol deuterated dithiothreitol hydrogen/deuterium heteronuclear single quantum coherence. transthyretin atomic force microscopy β-mercaptoethanol deuterated dithiothreitol hydrogen/deuterium heteronuclear single quantum coherence. In this work we have focused on the characterization of the fibrillar structure of TTR. We have recently developed a general method using NMR spectroscopy in combination with hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange to facilitate the identification of individual core residues within a fibril (10Ippel J.H. Olofsson A. Schleucher J. Lundgren E. Wijmenga S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The technique relies on the partial solvent protection of hydrogen-bonded amide protons throughout the length of the fibril. Back-bone amide protons located on the exterior of the fibril are more solvent-accessible and thus experience a relatively higher solvent exchange rate compared with amide protons that are located inside the fibril core and shielded from the solvent. In practice, the method works by pulse labeling fully protonated fibrils in a D2O solution over a given period of time. The resulting partially deuterated fibrils are subsequently converted into an NMR detectable monomeric state by resolubilization using a denaturing agent at low pH. This treatment traps the H/D exchange pattern originally present in the fibril and which can be detected via the soluble monomeric conformer. Apart from pinpointing the protected core residues of the fibril, the NMR method also allows for a specific quantification of their protection level. A detailed description of the method is presented elsewhere (10Ippel J.H. Olofsson A. Schleucher J. Lundgren E. Wijmenga S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A similar, but nonquantitative, approach was presented recently for fibrils derived from β2-microglobulin (11Hoshino M. Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The present study applies the method described above to the in vivo naturally occurring amyloidogenic variant, TTRY114C. This mutant protein can easily be induced to form fibrils at elevated temperatures under otherwise physiological conditions (12Eneqvist T. Olofsson A. Ando Y. Miyakawa T. Katsuragi S. Jass J. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13143-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and provides a representative model system for TTR amyloid. The critical process of dissolving fibrils into NMR-detectable monomers at a rate that is significantly faster than the exchange rate within the monomeric state is accomplished by the addition of SDS as a solubilizing agent. Monitoring of the H/D exchange was achieved by using two-dimensional 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy. This enabled us to make a quantitative determination of solvent protection factors within the fibrillar state at individual residue positions and thereby indirectly identify the structural regions involved in the fibril core structure. Based on the experimental data we propose a structural model of TTR amyloid and a possible mechanism for its formation. Protein Expression and Purification—The pET-3a vector containing the gene encoding TTRY114C was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 according to standard procedures. Uniformly 15N- or 15N, 13C-labeled protein was produced by growing cells in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and 13C-[C6]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as required. Protein expression was induced using 0.4 mm isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside. To lyse the cells 10 mg of lysozyme/g of pellet was added and incubated for 30 min. After lysis DNAs were added in the presence of Mn2+ ions followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was purified further using an anion exchange column (Mono Q HR 10/10 Amersham Biosciences) followed by gel filtration (Sephadex G-75, Superdex 16/60, Amersham Biosciences) using 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Pure fractions were pooled and concentrated using a spin column device with a 10-kDa filter (Amicon 10K, Millipore). Preparation of Amyloid Fibrils from TTRY114C—To obtain amyloid fibrils a 3 mm solution was incubated in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 55 °C for 96 h. 1% of β-mercaptoethanol (BME) was included to prevent intermolecular disulfide bridge formation. The initially clear solution changed its appearance into a viscous gel, which is a characteristic feature of amyloid fibrils. Gel Electrophoresis—Proteins were separated on a 16% polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel under constant voltage (native conditions) or in the presence of 0.1% SDS, according to standard procedures. 1% BME was included as a reducing agent. None of the samples was boiled. Under non-native conditions, samples were dissolved in 100 mm SDS loading buffer and separated further on a 16% SDS-PAGE according to standard procedures. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)—The aggregated TTRY114C was diluted to 3.6 μm with distilled water and applied onto freshly cleaved ruby red mica (Goodfellow, Cambridge, UK). Samples were allowed to adsorb for 30 s, washed three times with distilled water, and air dried. The bound material was imaged with a Nanoscope IIIa multimode AFM (Digital Instruments Santa Barbara, USA) using Tapping Mode™ in air. A silicon probe was oscillated at 300–325 kHz, and images were collected at an optimized scan rate corresponding to 0.7–1 Hz. The image was flattened and presented in height mode using Nanoscope software (Digital Instruments). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C, using a CD-6 spectrometer (Jobyn Yvon-spex France). Samples with a protein concentration of 20 μm were prepared in a 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Acquired spectra were collected between 195 and 250 nm and base line corrected by subtraction of a buffer reference spectrum. The ellipticity is reported as mean residue molar ellipticity ([θ], in degree·cm2·dmol-1) according to Equation 1,[θ]=100·[θ]obs/(C·L·N)(Eq. 1) where [θ]obs is the ellipticity (degrees), C is the concentration of polypeptide (M), L is the optical path length (cm), and N is the number of amino acid residues in the polypeptide. Evaluation of the secondary structure content of the protein was carried out by using the K2D prediction program (13Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometric analysis in combination with H/D exchange was used to study the exchange rate of labile protons within the fibrillar state. The aqueous fibrillar solution with a monomeric concentration of 200 μm was diluted 10 times in D2O and incubated for various lengths of time. To enable analysis the solution was quenched rapidly through addition of equal volumes of an icecooled solubilizing buffer consisting of 99% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid. The sample was subsequently injected within 20 s into a quadrupole electrospray mass spectrometer (Waters). The number of protected sites was determined from the measured mass and the theoretically calculated mass of a fully deuterated monomeric species. NMR Spectroscopy and Sequential Backbone Assignment of TTR in SDS—NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer, operating at 600 MHz (proton frequency) and equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance, pulsed field, z-gradient cryoprobe. A typical NMR sample contained 0.3 mm TTR, 100 mm deuterated SDS (d-SDS; D25, 98%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and 20 mm deuterated dithiothreitol (d-DTT; D10, 98%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) in 95% H2O, 5% D2O at pH 3.05 or in D2O at a pD of 3.45. The NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (14Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11446) Google Scholar) or XWINNMR (Bruker Biospin), although assignments were made in Ansig for Windows (15Helgstrand M. Kraulis P. Allard P. Hard T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The sequence-specific backbone resonance assignment of TTR followed the standard triple resonance strategy for 13C, 15N-labeled proteins, using two-dimensional 15N HSQC and three-dimensional 15N DIPSI-HSQC, 15N NOESY-HSQC, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HCANH, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, and C(CO)NH experiments (16Larsson G.

NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). H/D Exchange of TTRY114C Fibrils Analyzed by NMR—The H/D exchange experiment on the amyloid fibrils was performed by a brief centrifugation of the aqueous amyloid solution, which enabled the removal of the supernatant. The remaining amyloid pellet (∼100 μl) was subsequently diluted 10 times using D2O containing 5 mm phosphate buffer, pD 7.4, and 10 mm d-DTT. To ensure the essentially complete removal of H2O and BME the washing procedure was repeated two times. After a total of 10 min incubation in D2O, which includes the duration of the buffer exchange procedure, fibrils were pelleted and dissolved through the addition of 0.5 ml of D2O buffered to pD 3.45, containing 100 mm of d-SDS and 20 mm d-DTT. The protection of amide protons after dissolution of the fibrils was followed by a series of two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectra, starting 10 min after the SDS solution was added. Each experiment was recorded in 15 min with six transients per increment and 128 (t1) × 1024 (t2) complex data points. To be able to monitor quantitatively the dissolution of the fibrils into a monomeric species a one-dimensional proton spectrum was recorded prior to each HSQC spectrum. To discriminate between exchanging protons within the fibril and the monomeric species a reference H/D experiment was carried out on the SDS monomer. A protein solution in H2O (100 mm d-SDS and 20 mm d-DTT in 95% H2O and 5% D2O) was concentrated 10-fold followed by a rapid 10-fold dilution in a D2O solution (100 mm d-SDS and 20 mm d-DTT in 100% D2O) and the collection of an identical series of two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectra as above. Data Analysis and Fitting—To monitor the post-trap H/D exchange after dissolution of the partly exchanged TTRY114C fibrils in D2O, peak volumes from base-line corrected 15N HSQC spectra were obtained by integration using Bruker XWINNMR 3.1 software routines and analyzed by the CurveExpert 1.37 program. The relative total monomer concentration of the solution was determined from integration of the complete nonexchangeable methyl region in a one-dimensional proton NMR spectrum, recorded directly prior to each individual 15N HSQC spectrum. Consequently, the integrals of exchangeable amide proton cross-peaks in the 15N HSQC spectra are corrected for the effective monomeric concentration at any specific time after dissolution of the fibrils. The post-trap decays of these corrected amide proton integral (I) of each protected residue in the monomeric state were fitted to a single exponential function,I(t)=I0·e[-ksolv(monomer)·t](Eq. 2) where ksolv is the post-trap H/D exchange rate and I0 is the extrapolated proton integral at time zero. The latter describes the degree of protonation of amide groups that survived the deuterium exchange period with D2O in the fibril state, prior to resolubilization by SDS. The actual fraction of protection within the fibrillar state could thus be calculated by a comparison of corresponding peak integrals in a similarly treated, but fully protonated, reference spectrum. By definition the relative ratio between I0 in the two spectra is 100% in absence of any H/D exchange process and 0% under conditions of complete H/D exchange. Structure Modeling—A model of the fibril structure of TTRY114C was generated using the coordinates from wild-type TTR (PDB 1F41), the experimentally determined protection factors, and known intermolecular distances (3Jimenez J.L. Guijarro J.I. Orlova E. Zurdo J. Dobson C.M. Sunde M. Saibil H.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 18Serag A.A. Altenbach C. Gingery M. Hubbell W.L. Yeates T.O.

Biol. 2002; 9: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The monomeric structure was modified manually in MOLMOL (20Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51-55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6477) Google Scholar) by adding the N- and C-terminal residues missing in the crystal structure, and by dislocating strands C and D, followed by an energy minimization in Swiss-PdbViewer (version 3.7, www.expasy.ch/spdbv (21Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9503) Google Scholar)) using the GROMOS96 43B1 force field. The performed energy minimization had a negligible effect on the overall structure but was important to repair the local geometries that were distorted as a result of the manual modifications. A structural model of the fibril was created in MOLMOL by positioning the modified monomers in accordance with our measured protection factors and potential intermolecular hydrogen bonding partners, as well as known intermolecular distances, forming two interface regions: (i) a novel interface between the antiparallel β-strands A-A′ and B-B′, centered at residues 13 and 31, respectively; (ii) a near native interface between the antiparallel β-strands F-F′ and H-H′ centered at residues 93 and 118, respectively. TTRY114C Forms Amyloid upon Incubation at an Elevated Temperature—The mutant protein TTRY114C was expressed in E. coli and purified as a native tetramer (12Eneqvist T. Olofsson A. Ando Y. Miyakawa T. Katsuragi S. Jass J. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13143-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As a result of the mutation Tyr114 → Cys114 the tetrameric fold of the protein is destabilized and consequently acquires an enhanced propensity to form amyloid at near physiological pH (pH 7) and ionic strength (100 mm NaCl). An increased temperature also significantly enhances the rate of aggregation. In a kinetic experiment a 0.15 mm sample of TTRY114C was incubated at 55 °C, and the aggregation was followed by native PAGE (see Fig. 1A). After 96 h essentially all the material had assembled as high molecular weight aggregates at the top of the gel. The presence of amyloid fibrils was verified by AFM. Fig. 1B shows a representative AFM image of these fibrils. The cysteine residue in position 10, present in both wild-type TTR and TTRY114C, as well as the additional Cys114 residue in TTRY114C, are complicating features because of the potential formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds within the fibrils (22Thylen C. Wahlqvist J. Haettner E. Sandgren O. Holmgren G. Lundgren E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (12Eneqvist T. Olofsson A. Ando Y. Miyakawa T. Katsuragi S. Jass J. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13143-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To avoid interference of intermolecular disulfide linkage 1% BME was included during the incubation at 55 °C. This treatment effectively blocked intermolecular disulfide bridge formation, as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis where fibrils were dissolved in a 100 mm SDS solution without previous boiling of the protein sample. The well defined sharp band that can be seen in Fig. 1A, lane 8, corresponds to the expected size of a monomer. CD Suggests Less Secondary Structure within the TTR Fibrils Compared with the Native State—Far UV CD spectroscopy was used to investigate further the structural properties of TTRY114C. The nearly identical CD spectra observed for the native form of TTRY114C and TTR wild-type (see Fig. 2) were analyzed by the K2D prediction program (13Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) and resulted in an estimated β-sheet content of 42 and 40%, respectively. This is in agreement with a recently presented crystal structure of TTRY114C showing only subtle differences from the native TTR wild-type (12Eneqvist T. Olofsson A. Ando Y. Miyakawa T. Katsuragi S. Jass J. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13143-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). TTRY114C fibrils formed at a protein concentration around 20 μm at pH 7 (verified by AFM) did not cause significant turbidity, a fact that allows for secondary structure analysis by means of CD spectroscopy together with the K2D program (13Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The estimated β-sheet content of the fibrillar fold is ∼26%, which, compared with the native fold, corresponds to a loss of nearly 40% of β-sheet in favor of a more random coil structure. The result is in accordance with a previous study on TTR wild-type amyloid (23Olofsson A. Ippel H.J. Baranov V. Hörstedt P. Wijmenga S. Lundgren E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39592-39599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and is further evidence that the internal structural organization of the amyloid state differs significantly from that of the native state. TTRY114C Fibrils Are Rapidly Dissociated by SDS—The architecture of amyloid fibrils, in many cases, confers a high stability against denaturants. To monitor the H/D exchange pattern of amide protons in the fibril, using our methodology, it is important to achieve rapid dissociation of the fibrils into a monomeric species at a rate faster than the intrinsic rate of H/D exchange. Several different agents were tested for optimal dissolution. The requirements were best fulfilled in an aqueous solution containing SDS, as illustrated by SDS-PAGE analysis where the fibrils are rapidly dissociated into a monomeric species (the well defined band in Fig. 1A, lane 8). To trap the H/D exchange pattern of the fibril, dissolution was carried out in SDS/D2O solution buffered to a pD of 3.45, where the intrinsic solvent exchange rate is at a minimum. SDS is also known to induce α-helical conformation, which further prolongs the post-trap exchange times within these structured regions of the monomer. A CD spectrum of fibrils dissolved in 100 mm SDS at pH 3.05 (corresponding to pD 3.45) is shown in Fig. 2. The appearance of a strong absorption minimum at 210 nm, and to some extent at 222 nm, is characteristic for a protein with α-helical secondary structure and estimated to 42% by the K2D program (13Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), clearly visualizing the increased content of helices under these conditions. Sequential Backbone Assignment of TTRY114C in SDS Solution—A prerequisite for the indirect analysis of the exchange pattern of the TTRY114C fibril is the assignment of protein resonances from the monomeric species found in SDS solution. The 15N HSQC of a 0.3 mm protein sample, dissolved in 100 mm d-SDS, 1 mm d-DTT, and recorded at 25 °C at pH 3.05 showed a spectrum with fairly broad resonances and a limited dispersion of chemical shifts (Fig. 3A). Such an appearance is expected for an α-helical protein in complex with a SDS micelle, with a total estimated molecular mass of at least 30 kDa. Sequence-specific resonance assignments were obtained using standard assignment techniques, together with a set of three-dimensional triple resonance experiments. Taking the absence of an amide group on the N-terminal methionine and the 8 prolines into account, a total number of 119 amide backbone resonances should be visible in a 15N HSQC. Of these 119 resonances 83 were unambiguously assigned, but the assignment of residues Glu72 and Asp74 were ambiguous. Slow conformational exchange was observed in regions 98–102 and 119–127, close to Pro102 and Pro125, and was manifest as duplicate sets of resonances. Furthermore, amide resonances in the vicinity of Pro11, Pro24, and Pro113 were not observed or could not be assigned unambiguously because of exchange broadening or overlap. In total, 85 useful probes were available for the following H/D exchange studies. NMR Analysis of TTRY114C Fibrils Using H/D Exchange— The amyloid fibrils obtained from TTRY114C at protein concentrations of around 1 mm exhibited a gel-like appearance and were easily pelleted from the gel solution through centrifugation. The exchange from the H2O solution (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1% BME) to a D2O solution (5 mm sodium phosphate, pD 7.4, and 10 mm d-DTT) was performed by the addition of a 10-fold volume excess of buffered D2O solution to the pelleted fibrils, directly followed by vigorous shaking and re-collection of the pellet by centrifugation. The whole procedure was repeated twice, which effectively removed residual H2O and BME. Mass spectrometry measurements showed that the bulk of the fast exchanging, solvent-exposed, amide protons were substituted by deuterons within 10 min from the start of incubation (fibrils incubated in D2O). After that time a plateau of significantly slower exchange was reached (Fig. 4A). The observed exchange rates are in accordance with similar investigations on TTRwt (24Nettleton E.J. Robinson C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our mass spectrometry data suggest that around 45 amide protons remain protected within the fibrillar state of TTRY114C after 10 min of H/D exchange. To perform analysis by NMR, the fibrils were likewise subjected to a 10-min incubation period in D2O solvent, followed by rapid dissociation into NMR-detectable monomers by the addition of a D2O solution containing 100 mm d-SDS and 10 mm d-DTT, buffered to pD 3.45 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 3B shows a selected region of the first 15N HSQC spectrum recorded 10 min after resolubilization of the fibrils into monomers. Approximately 50 amide hydrogens were found to be protected from solvent exchange. To obtain a quantitative value for the protection level of each preserved residue within the fibril, the post-trap exchange in the monomeric state was followed through a series of 15N HSQC experiments recorded at regular time intervals. Fig. 3C shows the 15N HSQC spectrum obtained 40 min after dissolution. The nondeuterated reference spectrum of TTRY114C is shown in Fig. 3A. The post-trap decay of the amide proton integral of each protected residue was fitted to a single exponential function, making it possible, by extrapolation, to obtain the amide proton integral at time zero of fibril solubilization. This initial value represents the degree of protection each residue experienced in the fibrillar state. A comparison with a fully protonated reference sample then gives the percentage of protection within the fibrillar state: by definition a value of 100% in absence of any H/D exchange process, and a minimum of 0% under conditions of complete H/D exchange. Fig. 4B shows a representative curve fit for residues 93 and 110. As reported previously (10Ippel J.H. Olofsson A. Schleucher J. Lundgren E. Wijmenga S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the rate of fibril dissolution is nonlinear; in other words, not all fibrils convert to NMR-detectable monomers at the same rate.

https://openalex.org/W2054912533,"We have identified and characterized a 14-kDa human thioredoxin (Trx)-related protein designated TRP14. This cytosolic protein was expressed in all tissues and cell types examined, generally in smaller amounts than Trx1. Although TRP14 contains five cysteines, only the two Cys residues in its WCPDC motif were exposed and redox sensitive. Unlike Trx1, which was an equally good substrate for both Trx reductase 1 (TrxR1) and TrxR2, oxidized TRP14 was reduced by TrxR1 but not by TrxR2. Biochemical characterization of TRP14 suggested that, like Trx1, TRP14 is a disulfide reductase; its active site cysteine is sufficiently nucleophilic with the pKa value of 6.1; and its redox potential (–257 mV) is similar to those of other cellular thiol reductants. However, although TRP14 reduced small disulfide-containing peptides, it did not reduce the disulfides of known Trx1 substrates, ribonucleotide reductase, peroxiredoxin, and methionine sulfoxide reductase. These results suggest that TRP14 and Trx1 might act on distinct substrate proteins. We have identified and characterized a 14-kDa human thioredoxin (Trx)-related protein designated TRP14.

These results suggest that TRP14 and Trx1 might act on distinct substrate proteins. The redox state of cysteine residues, on which the structure and function of many proteins depend, is maintained by intracellular redox-regulatory molecules such as thioredoxin (Trx). 1The abbreviations used are: TrxthioredoxinRNRribonucleotide reductasePrxperoxiredoxinMSRmethionine sulfoxide reductasePTENa 3-phosphatase for phosphoinositidesASK1apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1GrxglutaredoxinTRP1414-kDa thioredoxin-related proteinTrxR1Trx reductase 1DTNB5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Central to the redox-regulatory function of Trx is the ability of the reduced form of the molecule to recognize and reduce proteins containing a disulfide (1Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar, 2Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Google Scholar). The reducing equivalents are provided by two redox-active cysteines (Cys32 and Cys35 in mammalian Trx1) that are located within a WCGPC motif (also called CXXC motif) that is conserved among Trx molecules from all species (1Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar, 2Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Google Scholar, 3Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox.

Because the pKa for the N-terminal Cys of the WCGPC motif is substantially lower than the usual value of 8.5 for cysteine residues (5Kallis G.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Google Scholar), this Cys exists at neutral pH as a thiolate anion (Cys-S–), which is more reactive than protonated cysteine. After Trx1 (consisting of 105 amino acids) binds to the oxidized substrate, the thiolate of Cys32 of Trx1 forms a transient mixed disulfide with the substrate that is subsequently attacked by Cys35 to generate oxidized Trx1 and reduced substrate. thioredoxin ribonucleotide reductase peroxiredoxin methionine sulfoxide reductase a 3-phosphatase for phosphoinositides apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 glutaredoxin 14-kDa thioredoxin-related protein Trx reductase 1 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Substrates for the disulfide reductase activity of Trx1 include ribonucleotide reductase (RNR); peroxiredoxin (Prx); methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR); PTEN (a 3-phosphatase for phosphoinositides) (6Stubbe J.

Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Google Scholar). RNR, Prx, and MSR generate a disulfide-containing intermediate during catalysis, the reduction of which by Trx1 is essential for catalytic function. PTEN and certain transcription factors contain H2O2-sensitive cysteines, the oxidation of which inactivates their enzymatic and DNA binding activities, respectively. Trx1 also regulates protein function by binding to target proteins without affecting their redox state. For example, Trx1 in its reduced form binds to and thereby inhibits the activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) (15Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Google Scholar, 16Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Google Scholar, 17Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Google Scholar), an upstream activator of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Oxidation of the Cys residues of the WCGPC motif of Trx1 induces dissociation of the Trx1-ASK1 complex, releasing the inhibitory effect of Trx1. Trx1 also binds in a redox-sensitive manner to vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1 (VDUP1) (18Nishiyama A. Matsui M. Iwata S. Hirota K. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Takagi Y. Sono H. Gon Y. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21645-21650Google Scholar). Because thiolate anions are more sensitive to oxidation than are protonated thiols, the two Cys residues of the WCGPC motif of Trx1 readily form a disulfide in the presence of oxidants. Thus, Trx1 is able to serve as a redox sensor and transducer that imparts information on cellular redox status to proteins that do not possess their own redox-sensitive residues. The various substrates for the disulfide reductase activity of Trx1 and the targets for the redox-transducer role of this protein share no apparent structural similarity. Nevertheless, Trx1 interacts with these proteins with a relatively high affinity, as indicated by the micromolar range of Km values for RNR and Prx (19Joelson T. Sjoberg B.M. Eklund H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3183-3188Google Scholar, 20Gleason F.K. Lim C.J. Gerami-Nejad M. Fuchs J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3701-3709Google Scholar, 21Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Diabetes Res.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Google Scholar). The interaction appears to be specific, given that oxidized Prx and PTEN are substrates for Trx1 but not for glutaredoxin (Grx), another redox mediator that contains the CXXC motif (10Lee S.-R. Yang K.-S. Kwon J. Lee C. Jeong W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20336-20342Google Scholar, 23Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Google Scholar); that oxidized NF-κB is reduced by Trx1 but not by glutathione (GSH) and GSH reductase (11Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H. Takeuchi J. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27891-27897Google Scholar); and that Trx1 and Grx inhibit ASK1 activity by binding to the N- and C-terminal regions of the kinase, respectively (22Song J.J. Rhee J.G. Suntharalingam M. Walsh S.A. Spitz D.R. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46566-46575Google Scholar). Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the structure of Trx1 complexed with several target proteins (or peptides) has revealed that the active site surface relies on different combinations of amino acid residues to provide the binding sites required for the recognition of such proteins (25Qin J. Yang Y. Velyvis A. Gronenborn A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 827-840Google Scholar). Nevertheless, given the large number of proteins that undergo reversible disulfide formation in response to changes in cellular redox state (26Kim J.R. Yoon H.W. Kwon K.S. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 283: 214-221Google Scholar), it is likely that additional Trx-like proteins support specific reduction reactions. We have now identified a 14-kDa cytosolic protein, designated Trx-related protein 14 (TRP14), which contains a WCPDC motif. To demonstrate that TRP14 has the potential to serve as a disulfide reductase like Trx, we evaluated its biochemical properties including identification of the redox-sensitive cysteines and determination of its redox potential and pKa. Comparison of these properties with those of Trx1 suggests that the disulfide reductase activities of the two proteins are similar. Indeed, TRP14 and Trx1 reduced small disulfide-containing peptides at similar rates. However, TRP14 exhibited negligible disulfide reductase activity with three known Trx1 substrates RNR, Prx, and MSR. These results suggest the specificity of disulfide reductase reaction. Materials—Rat Trx reductase 1 (TrxR1) and TrxR2 were purified from liver and specific antisera to these proteins were prepared as described (27Lee S.R. Kim J.R. Kwon K.S. Yoon H.W. Levine R.L. Ginsburg A. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4722-4734Google Scholar). Recombinant rat Trx1 and human PrxI were prepared as described (8Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Google Scholar). RNR and MSR were kindly provided by B. Cooperman (Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania) and J. Moskovitz (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health), respectively. Rabbit antiserum to human TRP14 was produced by injection of the purified protein according to standard procedures. Insulin, NADPH, and NADP+ were purchased from Calbiochem. Oxytocin, vasopressin, and iodoacetamide were from Sigma, and iodo[1-14C]acetamide was from Amersham Biosciences. Cloning and Mutagenesis of Human TRP14 —The DNA sequence encoding human TRP14 was amplified by PCR from a HeLa cell cDNA library (Clontech) with a forward primer (5′-GTCGTGCATATGGCCCGCTATGAGGAGGTGAGC-3′) containing both an NdeI site (underlined) and the initiation codon (bold) and with a reverse primer (5′-CGCGGATCCTTAATCTTCAGAGAACAACATTTCC-3′) containing both a BamHI site (underlined) and the stop codon (bold). The PCR product was purified, digested with NdeI and BamHI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pET-11a vector for expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Two TRP14 mutant proteins, C43S and C46S, in which Cys43 and Cys46 are individually replaced by serine, were generated by standard PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis with complementary primers containing a 1-bp mismatch that converted the codon for cysteine to one for serine. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and then ligated into the corresponding sites of pET-11a. Purification of Recombinant Human TRP14 —E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET-11a encoding wild-type or mutant TRP14 proteins was cultured at 37 °C, in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), until the optical density of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.5 to 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to the culture at a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and after incubation for an additional 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –70 °C until use. The frozen cells were suspended in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by sonication. After removal of nucleic acid with streptomycin sulfate, proteins were precipitated by slowly adding solid ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation and dissolved in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 m ammonium sulfate. After clarification, the soluble fraction was applied at a flow rate of 5 ml/min to a TSK Phenyl-5PW column (21.5 by 150 mm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 m ammonium sulfate. The flow-through fraction was collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon YM10 device), and then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA. The dialyzed sample was applied to a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA. Proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.3 m over 60 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fractions corresponding to the peak of TRP14 were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0). Determination of Protein Concentration—The concentrations of recombinant human TRP14 as well as of rat Trx1, TrxR1, and TrxR2 were determined spectroscopically with A280 values for 0.1% solutions of 1.293, 0.738, 0.937, and 1.077, respectively, calculated on the basis of amino acid composition. The concentrations of other proteins were determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. cDNA Cloning, Genomic Organization, and Sequence Analysis of the Human TRP14 Gene—We previously developed a procedure for the detection of proteins that contain a ROS-sensitive cysteine residue with a low pKa (26Kim J.R. Yoon H.W. Kwon K.S. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 283: 214-221Google Scholar). This procedure detected a rat brain protein that contains a reactive Cys conforming to the WCXXC motif (the CXXC sequence is preceded by W in Trx proteins and by Y in Grx proteins); the sequence of the alkylated peptide obtained after digestion of the protein with the endoproteinase Lys-C was determined as SWCPD-CVEAEPIIREGLK (data not shown). A homology search of the GenBank™ data base with this peptide sequence using BLAST program yielded the human cDNA clones ZC48G12 (GenBank™ accession number, AF086210) and MGC14353 (GenBank™ accession number, BC006405). The DNA sequence of MGC14353 consists of an open reading frame of 372 bp, a 5′-untranslated region of 68 bp including an in-frame stop codon (TAG), and a 3′-untranslated region containing two putative polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) (Fig. 1A). The ZC48G12 clone contains a shorter 3′-untranslated region and may have originated from an mRNA whose transcription was terminated by the first polyadenylation signal. The predicted open reading frame encodes a protein of 123 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 14 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.4. This protein shares 20% sequence identity and 37% similarity with human Trx1 (Fig. 1B) and was therefore designated Trx-related protein 14 (TRP14). We cloned the TRP14 cDNA from a HeLa cell cDNA library. A BLAT search of the working draft of the human genome sequence revealed that the gene for TRP14 is located at chromosome 17p13.1 and comprises four exons as well as three introns that conform to the GT/AG rule. The predicted protein does not contain a known signal peptide for targeting to a specific subcellular compartment, and subcellular fractionation of HeLa cell homogenates into organellar, plasma membrane, and cytosolic fractions revealed TRP14 to be enriched in the cytosolic fraction (data not shown). A BLAST homology search of the GenBank™ data base yielded several TRP14 homologs in a wide range of species from bacteria to mammals (Fig. 1C). Sequence alignment of these homologous proteins revealed that the WCPDC motif was fully conserved, indicating the potential importance of this motif in TRP14 function. Cellular and Tissue Distribution of TRP14 —Total soluble fractions prepared from rat tissues and cultured human cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for TRP14 or for Trx1. The specificity of the antibodies is shown in Fig. 2A. TRP14 was detected in all tissues examined, being most abundant in liver, kidney, pancreas, and uterus (Fig. 2B). Although TRP14 appeared to be present in smaller amounts than Trx1 in most of the cell lines examined, like Trx1 it seemed to be ubiquitous (Fig. 2C). Comparison of immunoblot intensities with those of protein standards yielded estimates of 0.3 and 1.8 μg/mg of cell lysates for the amounts of TRP14 and Trx1, respectively, in HeLa cells (Fig. 2D). The CXXC Motif of TRP14 Is a Redox Active Site—TRP14 contains three cysteine residues (Cys64, Cys69, Cys110) in addition to the conserved Cys43 and Cys46. To examine the oxidation status of these Cys residues, we quantified the thiol content of reduced and oxidized forms of TRP14 by spectrophotometric titration with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) under nondenaturing or denaturing (6 m guanidinium chloride) conditions. Only two of the five cysteine residues in the reduced native enzyme were available for oxidation by DTNB or H2O2; the remaining three Cys residues remained unmodified in the native protein (Table I).Table IDetermination of the thiol content of TRP14NativeDenaturedOxidized0.123.09Reduced1.934.95 Open table in a new tab To investigate which cysteine residues are redox sensitive, we analyzed peptides derived from oxidized or reduced TRP14. The free SH groups of TRP14 were masked with iodoacetamide under denaturing conditions, the protein was digested with Lys-C, and the resulting peptides were resolved by reversedphase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Fig. 3). Comparison of the elution profiles of reduced and oxidized TRP14 indicated that peak b corresponds to a peptide with a disulfide linkage and that peak a corresponds to the reduced form of this peptide. Indeed, after reduction with DTT and modification with iodoacetamide, the purified peptide b eluted at a retention time identical to that of peptide a. Amino acid sequencing of peptides a and b revealed identical sequences of SWCPDCVQAEPVVREGLK. These results indicated that the conserved Cys residues (Cys43 and Cys46) of TRP14 are oxidized by H2O2 and form an intramolecular disulfide bond that is sensitive to reduction by DTT. Reduction of oxidized E. coli Trx was previously shown to increase tryptophan fluorescence by 2.5-fold (28Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1992-1998Google Scholar, 29Krause G. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4056-4066Google Scholar, 30Slaby I. Cerna V. Jeng M.F. Dyson H.J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3091-3096Google Scholar). TRP14, which contains Trp77 and Trp42, also produced a 2.6-fold increase in tryptophan fluorescence when reduced (Fig. 4), suggesting changes in the microenvironment around the two tryptophan residues. TRP14 Is a Substrate for TrxR1 but Not TrxR2—Trx function requires a reversible change in the redox status of the CXXC motif. Reduction of oxidized Trx molecules is catalyzed by the NADPH-dependent enzyme Trx reductase (TrxR) (31Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Google Scholar, 32Lee S.R. Bar-Noy S. Kwon J. Levine R.L. Stadtman T.C. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2521-2526Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain two isoforms of both Trx and TrxR: Trx1 and TrxR1 are localized predominantly to the cytosol, whereas Trx2 and TrxR2 are synthesized in the cytosol with a mitochondrial targeting sequence that results in their translocation into mitochondria (27Lee S.R. Kim J.R. Kwon K.S. Yoon H.W. Levine R.L. Ginsburg A. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4722-4734Google Scholar, 33Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of TrxR1 and TrxR2 are 54% identical (27Lee S.R. Kim J.R. Kwon K.S. Yoon H.W. Levine R.L. Ginsburg A. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4722-4734Google Scholar). Although the overall amino acid sequence identity of Trx1 and Trx2 is only 35%, the active site sequence (WCGPCK) is conserved and both proteins are equally good substrates for TrxR1 or TrxR2 in the NADPH-dependent reduction reaction (27Lee S.R. Kim J.R. Kwon K.S. Yoon H.W. Levine R.L. Ginsburg A. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4722-4734Google Scholar). We examined whether oxidized TRP14 is reduced by TrxR1 in the presence of NADPH by monitoring NADPH oxidation at 340 nm. The reduction of oxidized TRP14 by TrxR1 occurred slightly faster than did that of oxidized Trx1 (Fig. 5A). The acceptor of the electrons from NADPH in TRP14 was shown to be the disulfide formed between Cys43 and Cys46 by the observation that two mutant proteins (C43S and C46S) in which these residues were individually replaced by serine did not support TrxR1-dependent NADPH oxidation (Fig. 5B). Performance of the NADPH oxidation reaction in the presence of various concentrations of TRP14 or Trx1 (data not shown) allowed determination of kinetic parameters by Michaelis-Menten analysis (Table II). The Km and kcat values were similar for the reduction of TRP14 and Trx1 by TrxR1, but the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for the TRP14 reaction was slightly higher than that for the Trx1 reaction. In contrast, the reduction of TRP14 by TrxR2 was negligible compared with that of Trx1 (Fig. 5C). The reduction of TRP14 by GSH or glutathione reductase (GR) in the presence of NADPH was also negligible (data not shown).Table IIKinetic parameters for the reduction of TRP14 and Trx1 by TrxR1kcatKmkcat/Kmmin-1μmmin-1 μm-1TRP141297.28.3156.3Trx11233.210.8114.2 Open table in a new tab TRP14 versus Trx1 as a Disulfide Reductase—The pKa values of Cys residues in the CXXC motif are important determinants of reductase activity, given that initial nucleophilic attack on the substrate disulfide is mediated by the N-terminal thiolate anion of this motif. To evaluate the potential of TRP14 to act as a disulfide reductase and to compare such an ability with that of Trx1, we determined the pKa values of TRP14 and Trx1. The pKa of a Cys residue can be determined from the pH dependence of its reaction with alkylating reagents, which react preferentially with the ionized thiolate anion (5Kallis G.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Google Scholar). From the pH dependence of the alkylation reaction with [14C]iodoacetamide (Fig. 6A), the pKa values for TRP14 and Trx1 were determined to be ∼6.1 and ∼7.3, respectively. The corresponding value for E. coli Trx is 6.7 (5Kallis G.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Google Scholar). The N-terminal cysteine (Cys43) of the CXXC motif appears to be responsible for this low pKa value of TRP14, given that the C43S mutant was labeled poorly with iodoacetamide even at pH 8.0 (data not shown). We also determined the standard-state redox potential (E0′), another important determinant of reductase activity as previously described for E. coli Trx (34Lin T.Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15508-15513Google Scholar). The E0′ value of TRP14, calculated on the basis of the equilibrium established between NADPH and recombinant TRP14 in the presence of TrxR1 at pH 7.0 and 25 °C, were –257 mV (Fig. 6B). This value is similar to those of other cellular reductants including E. coli Trx (–270 to –267 mV) (34Lin T.Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15508-15513Google Scholar, 35Mossner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Glockshuber R. Aslund F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25254-25259Google Scholar), three E. coli isoforms of Grx (–233 to –198 mV) (36Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Google Scholar), and GSH (–240 mV) (36Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Google Scholar). We attempted to measure the E0′ value of Trx1 but failed. This is probably because, unlike E. coli Trx, mammalian Trx1 proteins contain three additional Cys residues in addition to the two in their active site and one of them, Cys73, forms an intermolecular disulfide, which is relatively insensitive to reduction by TrxR1 (37Weichsel A. Gasdaska J.R. Powis G. Montfort W.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 735-751Google Scholar). Trx1 and TrxR1 couple the ribonucleotide reductase activity of RNR, the methionine sulfoxide reductase activity of MSR, and the peroxidase activity of Prx to NADPH oxidation by reducing the disulfide-containing enzyme intermediates (6Stubbe J. Riggs-Gelasco P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 438-443Google Scholar, 7Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Google Scholar, 8Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

We compared the abilities of TRP14 and Trx1 to support these enzyme activities by monitoring NADPH oxidation in the presence of TrxR1 and NADPH (Fig. 7). The activity supported by TRP14 was only 2–4% of that supported by Trx1 for all three enzymes, suggesting that TRP14 is a poor electron donor for the oxidized forms of RNR, MSR and Prx. We next measured the disulfide reductase activities of TRP14 and Trx1 toward insulin (5700 Da), which contains one intramolecular and two intermolecular disulfides. Disulfide reductase activity was monitored by detection of free SH groups with DTNB. Although TRP14 exhibited a concentration-dependent disulfide reductase activity toward insulin, this activity was much smaller than that of Trx1 (Fig. 8A). Reductase activity was also measured with oxytocin and vasopressin, both of which comprise nine amino acids and contain an intramolecular disulfide. The initial reaction rates with either peptide substrate were similar for TRP14 and Trx1, but the rate of each TRP14 reaction slowed markedly with time (Fig. 8, B and C). This slowing was probably attributable to the Km values of TRP14 for the two peptides being higher than the concentration (0.1 mm) of the peptides used in the assay; the rates thus gradually decreased as the substrate was depleted (75–80% of each peptide was estimated to be reduced during 200 s on the basis of the decrease in A340). The constant rate of the Trx1 reactions apparent until near completion of reduction indicates that the Km values of Trx1 for the two peptides are substantially less than 0.1 mm. Peroxidase Activity of TRP14 —Trx1 alone has been suggested to act as an antioxidant that scavenges H2O2 (4Hirota K. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Yodoi J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 957: 189-199Google Scholar). The reactive CXXC motif readily undergoes oxidation-reduction in the presence of H2O2, NADPH, and TrxR. TRP14 was also shown to be capable of reducing H2O2; its specific activity measured in the presence of 1 mm H2O2 was 23 nmol/min per milligram, which was about four times that of Trx1 (Fig. 9A). This peroxidase activity of TRP14 was attributable to the CXXC motif, given that the C43S mutant did not reduce H2O2 (Fig. 9A). The peroxidase activity of TRP14 was dependent on enzyme concentration (Fig. 9B) and H2O2 concentration (Fig. 9C). The H2O2 concentration dependence of the reaction yielded a Km value of >3–5 mm, suggesting that TRP14 is not likely to contribute substantially to peroxidase activity in cells. Some peroxidases exhibit differential activity with lipid peroxides and H2O2 (38Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Google Scholar). Experiments with cumene peroxide and t-butyl peroxide revealed that the activity of TRP14 with H2O2 is markedly greater than that with hydrophobic peroxides (Fig. 9D). Cellular redox status undergoes substantial changes in association with various cellular processes (39Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Google Scholar, 40Kirlin W.G. Cai J.

https://openalex.org/W2003133442,"Single-molecule measurements of the activities of a variety of enzymes show that rates of catalysis may vary markedly between different molecules in putatively homogenous enzyme preparations. We measured the rate at which purified <i>Escherichia coli</i> RNA polymerase moves along a ∼2650-bp DNA during transcript elongation <i>in vitro</i> at 0.5 mm nucleoside triphosphates. Individual molecules of a specifically biotinated RNA polymerase derivative were tagged with 199-nm diameter avidin-coated polystyrene beads; enzyme movement along a surface-linked DNA molecule was monitored by observing changes in bead Brownian motion by light microscopy. The DNA was derived from a naturally occurring transcription unit and was selected for the absence of regulatory sequences that induce lengthy pausing or termination of transcription. With rare exceptions, individual enzyme molecules moved at a constant velocity throughout the transcription reaction; the distribution of velocities across a population of 140 molecules was unimodal and was well fit by a Gaussian. However, the width of the Gaussian, σ = 6.7 bp/s, was considerably larger than the precision of the velocity measurement (1 bp/s). The observations show that different transcription complexes have differences in catalytic rate (and thus differences in structure) that persist for thousands of catalytic turnovers. These differences may provide a parsimonious explanation for the complex transcription kinetics observed in bulk solution."
https://openalex.org/W2070186209,"Dislocation of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen to cytosol is considered to occur in a single step that is tightly coupled to proteasomal degradation. Here we show that dislocation of luminal ERAD substrates occurs in two distinct consecutive steps. The first is passage across ER membrane to the ER cytosolic face, where substrates can accumulate as ubiquitin conjugates. In vivo, this step occurs despite proteasome inhibition but requires p97/Cdc48p because substrates remain entrapped in ER lumen and are prevented from ubiquitination in cdc48 yeast strain. The second dislocation step is the release of accumulated substrates to the cytosol. In vitro, this release requires active proteasome, consumes ATP, and relies on salt-removable ER-bound components, among them the ER-bound p97 and ER-bound proteasome, which specifically interact with the cytosol-facing substrates. An additional role for Cdc48p subsequent to ubiquitination is revealed in the cdc48 strain at permissive temperature, consistent with our finding that p97 recognizes luminal ERAD substrates through multiubiquitin. BiP interacts exclusively with ERAD substrates, suggesting a role for this chaperone in ERAD. We propose a model that assigns the cytosolic face of the ER as a midpoint to which luminal ERAD substrates emerge and p97/Cdc48p and the proteasome are recruited. Although p97/Cdc48p plays a dual role in dislocation and is involved both in passage of the substrate across ER membrane and subsequent to its ubiquitination, the proteasome takes part in the release of the substrate from the ER face to the cytosol en route to degradation.

The proteolytically active proteasome has been implicated in the dislocation of ERAD substrates by virtue of their scarcity in cytosol of proteasome-inhibited cells (8Chillaron J. Haas I.G. Mol.

In most cases, however, accumulation of the multiubiquitinated ERAD substrates to detectable levels requires inhibition of the proteasome. If the proteasome is indeed required for dislocation (8Chillaron J. Haas I.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C.

Under these conditions, μs or κ accumulate in the microsomal fractions rather than the cytosol, implicating the proteasome in dislocation (8Chillaron J. Haas I.G. Mol. Biol.

Nevertheless, we detected ubiquitination of the luminal μs when the proteasome proteolytic activity was inhibited (20Elkabetz Y. Kerem A. Tencer L. Winitz D. Kopito R.R. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol.

We investigate the roles of the proteasome and of the recently discovered cytosolic ERAD chaperone p97/Cdc48p (21Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Frohlich K.U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell.

Frohlich K.U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), we naturally chose to advance our study with this strain and its isogenic strain KFY100, which expresses wild-type CDC48 for comparison. The HA-tagged CPY* (prc1-1 allele) was expressed from plasmid pBG15 (generously provided by A. A Cooper, University of Missouri-Kansas City).Biosynthetic Labeling and Cell Incubation—Cells were starved for methionine for 45 min and either labeled for 45 min or pulse labeled for 15 min with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml; 1,000 Ci/mmol) and then chased in the presence of 25 μm ALLN, 5 μm MG-132, or their combinations. When not labeled, cells were incubated for 3–4 h with ALLN, MG-132, or their combinations. Cells and medium were separated, and cells were either lysed as described previously (24Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or subjected to cell fractionation (see below). Yeast cells were concentrated (5 A600) and incubated for 4 h at permissive (30 °C) or nonpermissive (37 °C) temperatures. Cells were collected and either lysed as described previously (21Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Frohlich K.U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) or subjected to fractionation (see below), and fractions were solubilized as described (24Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent deubiquitination, 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide was included in the lysis buffer.Cell Fractionation and in Vitro Dislocation Assays—38C cells incubated for 3–4 h with or without various drugs were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Yeast spheroplasts were prepared as described previously (17Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Yeast spheroplasts and B cells were disrupted by 25–40 passages through a 21-gauge needle. Postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was obtained (1,000 × g, 10 min, twice) from disrupted cells. PNS was further fractionated by centrifugation at 4 °C. B cells were fractionated into P10 (10,000 × g, 30 min) and P200 (200,000 × g, 1 h) microsomal pellets and S200 (200,000 × g, 1 h) cytosol supernatant; yeast cells were fractionated into P20 (20,000 × g, 30 min) microsomal pellets and S20 cytosol supernatant.For in vitro dislocation assays, 38C cells metabolically labeled for 45 min or unlabeled cells incubated for 3 h with or without various drugs were disrupted in 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. P10 microsomes were resuspended either in S10 cytosol from equivalent amounts of 38C or COS-7 cells (60 and 30 mg/ml protein, respectively), or in the disruption buffer, all containing 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 2 kallikrein inhibitor units/ml aprotinin. Resuspended microsomes, supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system (3 mm ATP, 5 units/ml creatine kinase, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 3 mm MgCl2) or treated with 25 units/ml apyrase were incubated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of MG-132, Z-L3 VS (a kind gift from M. Bogyo, University of California San Francisco and H. Ploegh, Harvard University) or ALLN. Reactions were terminated by incubation on ice followed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min) to separate microsomes and soluble fractions.Protease Protection Assay and Salt Wash—The optimized reaction was found to be a 45-min incubation at 30 °C with 5 μg/ml trypsin for PNS of B cells (adapted from Ref. 8Chillaron J. Haas I.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and a 30-min incubation on ice with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin for PNS of yeast (17Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by adding phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to 2.5 mm followed by centrifugation to fractionate PNS to microsomes and cytosol, as described above. Where indicated, microsomes were washed by resuspension in ice-cold 0.5 m KCl. Washed microsomes were recovered by centrifugation; wash supernatants were collected, and their proteins were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid.Immunoprecipitation and Immunodetection—IgM μ heavy chains, HA-tagged CPY*, BiP, or myc-tagged ubiquitin and their associated proteins were immunoprecipitated in each experiment from comparable amounts of lysed cells or fractions. For cytosolic fractions, an equal volume of lysis buffer was added. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation: goat anti-mouse μ (SouthernBiotech), mouse anti-HA (clone 12CA5), mouse anti-myc (clone 9E10), were all followed by protein A-Sepharose (RepliGen); rabbit anti-mouse BiP (Affinity BioReagent) was followed by anti-rabbit IgG-Sepharose (Sigma). Total cell extract proteins and immunoprecipitated μ, HA-CPY*, BiP, or myc-ubiquitin were resolved by reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and detected either by direct autoradiography or by immunoblotting. Antibodies used for immunoblotting were: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse μ (SouthernBiotech); biotin-conjugated mouse anti-BiP (SouthernBiotech) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Jackson); rabbit anti-μs (21Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Frohlich K.U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and rabbit anti-proteasome α subunit of Methanosarcina thermophila (Calbiochem) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson); mouse anti-HA (clone 12CA5), mouse anti-p97 (clone 58.13.3; ProGen), mouse anti-ubiquitin (clone P4D1, BabCO) used to detect ubiquitin in B cells and mouse anti-ubiquitin (clone Ubi-1, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) used to detect ubiquitin in yeast, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson). The horseradish peroxidase was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction. The amounts of radiolabeled or immunoblotted proteins were determined by densitometry, and relative levels were calculated.RESULTSThe luminal μs heavy chain exhibits developmentally regulated stability; while being a stable protein that is secreted efficiently from plasma cells, it is degraded rapidly in the earlier differentiation stages of pre-B and B cells (19Winitz D.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24145-24148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on its stabilization by a variety of proteasome inhibitors, we and others have shown that μs is degraded by the proteasome (9Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Amitay R. Shachar I. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20694-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Winitz D. Shachar I. Elkabetz Y. Amitay R. Samuelov M. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27645-27651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, in B lymphocytes treated with proteasome inhibitors, we were able to detect ubiquitinated species of μs (Fig. 1A; see also Ref. 20Elkabetz Y. Kerem A. Tencer L. Winitz D. Kopito R.R. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18922-18929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that, despite the inhibition of the proteasome, a part of the luminal μs must be dislocated to gain access to the cytosol-facing ubiquitination machinery. To test this hypothesis, we fractionated IgM-expressing 38C B cells and determined the topology of μs upon proteasome inhibition.Enhanced BiP Association with μs upon Proteasome Inhibition Suggests a Role for BiP in μs Dislocation—Upon fractionation of 38C B cells, the majority (∼80%) of μs was detected in the microsomal fraction, whereas only ∼20% was recovered in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1, A and D). The BiP that coprecipitated with μs was negligible and restricted to the microsomal fraction (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Upon blocking the proteasome, there was a ∼60% increase in the cellular content of μs, accompanied by 5–7-fold increase in the amount of coprecipitated BiP (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 5, and 9; Fig. 1G). This increase in μs was not recovered in the cytosolic fraction but rather in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 1, A and D). The enhanced coprecipitation of BiP could not be explained by accumulation of unassembled μs heavy chains, the favored substrate of BiP (31Hendershot L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), because none was detected (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). Importantly, this increase was not accompanied by any rise in cellular BiP content (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 5 and 9 with lane 1), indicating that the unfolded protein response was not elicited. Also, in reciprocal experiments, increased amounts of μs coprecipitated by an anti-BiP antibody (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 4 and 5 in the upper panel and lanes 5 and 6 in the lower panel). Thus, in proteasome-inhibited cells the physical stability of the BiP-μs complexes is enhanced. Our findings concur with the previously reported enhanced BiP coprecipitation and increased physical stability of the BiP-κ light chain complexes in proteasome-inhibited NS1 cells (8Chillaron J. Haas I.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BiP pulled down μs assembled with κ into μ2κ2 monomers but not unassembled μs (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 4 and 5). Furthermore, BiP pulled down only the unstable ERAD substrate μs but not its stable membrane isoform μm (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 1 and 2 in the lower panel and lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 1 and 2 in the upper panel). Taken together, our results suggest a novel role for BiP in ERAD of an already assembled secretory IgM, in addition to its established role in Ig assembly. In agreement with the genetic data in yeast (32Brodsky J.L. Werner E.D. Dubas M.E. Goeckeler J.L. Kruse K.B. McCracken A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), our results provide the first biochemical evidence for involvement of BiP in ERAD of luminal substrates in mammalian cells.Luminal μs Crosses the ER Membrane and Accumulates at the ER Cytosolic Face Despite Proteasome Inhibition—The finding that μs undergoes ubiquitination (20Elkabetz Y. Kerem A. Tencer L. Winitz D. Kopito R.R. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18922-18929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine the distribution of ubiquitinated μs in fractionated, proteasome-inhibited B cells. Heavily ubiquitinated μs was observed mostly in microsomes, in correlation with the distribution of the μs protein (Fig. 1A). These results demonstrated that ubiquitinated μs was associated with the microsomes while facing the cytosol.Protease protection assays demonstrated that the cytosol-facing ubiquitinated μs represented a significant proportion of the μs protein. In untreated cells, only ∼8% of microsomal μs was sensitive to trypsin, whereas in proteasome-inhibited cells, where microsomal μs rose to ∼160%, more than half of it was digested by trypsin (Fig. 1A and quantified results in Fig. 1E). We conclude that upon proteasome inhibition microsomal μs was redistributed between the two sides of the membrane so that the dislocated μs increased by 7-fold, whereas cytosolic μs hardly increased (Fig. 1D). As expected, all μs ubiquitin conjugates were completely digested by trypsin (Fig 1A). Importantly, the integrity of microsomal membranes was demonstrated by the complete protection of BiP from trypsin digestion (Fig. 1, A and C). The complete digestion of either dislocated μs (Fig. 1A) or luminal μs in Nonidet P-40-solubilized microsomes (data not shown) indicated that μs could be digested by trypsin. An additional indication for the membrane integrity was the fate of μm, the stable membrane isoform of μ heavy chains (24Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the KVK sequence in its C terminus, which faces the cytosol, and its single transmembrane span, the rest of this protein is luminally oriented. Indeed, μm was detected exclusively in microsomes and was fully protected from trypsin digestion regardless of proteasome inhibition (Fig. 1A).Another evidence for the cytosolic orientation of microsomal μs was afforded by the ability to remove it from the microsomal fractions by salt wash. When the proteasome was inhibited, the amounts of μs removed by salt increased considerably (Fig. 1F, lanes 1 and 2), compared with the moderate increase in the amounts of μs which remained in the washed microsomes (Fig. 1F, lanes 3 and 4). Importantly, neither μm nor luminal BiP was removed by salt wash, and both remained with the washed microsomes (Fig. 1F, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). Taken together, our findings define the cytosolic face of the ER membrane as a site to which the luminal ERAD substrate μs is fully dislocated. Not only the arrival of μs to this site occurs despite proteasome inhibition, but also the latter is a prerequisite for revealing this site.Dislocated μs Interacts Exclusively with the Microsome-bound Proteasome and Microsome-bound p97—Although the active proteasome appeared to play no role in μs dislocation, coprecipitation of the proteasome with μ indicated their physical interaction, which was actually enhanced ∼2.5-fold when the proteasome was proteolytically inactive (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 5, and 9; Fig. 1G). Remarkably, this interaction with μ was restricted to the proteasome subpopulation that was membrane-bound (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 5, and 9). This finding suggests a role for the previously identified small ER-bound subpopulation of this cytosolically abundant ERAD component (22Brooks P. Fuertes G. Murray R.Z. Bose S. Knecht E. Rechsteiner M.C. Hendil K.B. Tanaka K. Dyson J. Rivett J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and demonstrates, for the first time, interactions that involve this subpopulation. Moreover, these results are in agreement with the suggestion that the proteasome might be recruited to the ER membrane by multiubiquitinated ERAD substrates (23Hirsch C. Ploegh H.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 268-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Recent findings have implicated the p97/Cdc48p as a novel cytosolic component essential for ERAD (16Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 21Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Frohlich K.U. Diamant N.

In other PDE families, many splice variants show different tissue expression patterns and distinct subcellular localization and are subjected to unique regulation by protein kinases and associated proteins (8Francis S.H.

Thus, it is intriguing that alterations of the cyclic nucleotide-hydrolyzing activity of PDEs by the phosphorylation and compartmentalization of several signaling molecules such as PDEs, AKAPs, and PKA would be involved in the modulation of the subcellular signaling of cyclic nucleotides. However, changes in biological function of PDE10A2 by phosphorylation have not yet been reported. Here, we demonstrate the unique subcellular localization of PDE10A1, PDE10A2, and PDE10A3 variants and propose a novel mechanism for alteration of the subcellular localization of PDE10A.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[3H]cGMP, [3H]cAMP, and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences. Cyclic GMP, cAMP, Crotalus atrox snake venom, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine, rolipram, and calmodulin were purchased from Sigma. Dowex (1 × 8 200–400) was purchased from Dow Chemical Co.Generation of Antisera—Rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against the poly-l-lysine-based multiple antigen peptide (for PDE10A1) or the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide (for PDE10A2 and PDE10A3) complexes containing the sequences MRIEERKSQHLTGL (residues 1–14 of human PDE10A1), MEDGPSNNASCFRRLTE (residues 1–16 of human and rat PDE10A2), and MSNDSPEGAVGSCNA (residues 1–15 of rat PDE10A3). The peptides were synthesized by a PSSM-8 peptide synthesizer (Shimadzu, Japan) or purchased from Sawady Technology. The complexes were mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) for the first immunization and with Freund's incomplete adjuvant when boosted. After immunizing five times, antisera were collected and stored at -80 °C until use. Purified PDE10A antibody, which recognizes the common region in PDE10A variants, was prepared from the antiserum reported previously (12Fujishige K. Kotera J. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1118-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), using an antigen affinity chromatography from a HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antibody was eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.7) and then neutralized immediately.Preparation of PDE Isozymes from Rat Striatum—Male Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Japan SLC at 10 weeks of age were anesthetized with diethyl ether before striatum was excised and stored at -80 °C until use. A 0.36-g sample of rat striatum was disrupted in 7.2 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer HB-A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.3 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by a sonicator (TOMY Seiko, Japan). The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatants were designated as cytosolic fractions. The pellets were resuspended with a volume of ice-cold HBT-A buffer (HB-A buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100) equal to that of the cytosolic fractions. After sonication, the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants were designated as membrane fractions. The pellets were resuspended with a volume of ice-cold HBT-A buffer equal to that of the cytosolic fractions, designating detergent-insoluble fractions. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in each fraction was assayed using the LDH-cytotoxic test (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Approximately 20% of the total LDH activity was present in membrane fractions in these experiments. The membrane and cytosolic fractions were applied to a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in elution buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm benzamidine), with and without 0.5% Triton X-100, respectively. The column was washed with 20 ml of the above buffer used for equilibration, and proteins were then eluted from the column by running a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m, 100 ml) in the buffer. Fractions (2 ml each) collected on ice were assayed for cGMP and cAMP hydrolytic activities.PDE Assay—The PDE assay was performed by the radiolabeled nucleotide method. The assay buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.33 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma), enzyme solution, unlabeled cGMP or cAMP, and 12.5 nm [3H]cGMP or 4.88 nm [3H]cAMP. The reaction was started by mixing the substrate into 500 μl of the assay buffer, and tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After boiling for 1.5 min, the mixtures were added to 100 μl of 1 mg/ml Crotalus atrox snake venom and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of methanol. The resultant solutions were applied to a Dowex (1 × 8 200–400) column (5 × 12 mm), and flow-through fractions containing [3H]adenosine or [3H]guanosine were collected. After washing the column with 1.0 ml of methanol, the solutions passing through the column were mixed with the flow-through fractions. Aqueous scintillation mixtures were added to the mixtures, and the radioactivities were then measured.Chemical compounds were dissolved in Me2SO. For studies of the inhibition of PDE activities, inhibitors in Me2SO (final concentration 1% (v/v)) were added to the assay buffer containing enzyme and preincubated for 5 min before the reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate.Construction of Expression Plasmids—A DNA fragment for the amino-terminal region of human PDE10A1 was amplified by PCR using a primer set: 5′-AAAAAGCTTATGAGGATAGAAGAGAGG-3′ plus 5′-GCTGTTTAGTTCATATACAACTCCC-3′ and pBlue-PDE10A encoding human PDE10A1 cDNA (10Fujishige K.

The HindIII-KpnI fragment of an amplified DNA and the 2.4-kb KpnI fragment of pBlue-PDE10A were inserted into the HindIII-KpnI sites of the pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector, resulting in pFLAG-h10A1-p carrying an entire PDE10A1 coding sequence. By deleting the BamHI fragment of 3′-region of pFLAG-h10A1-p, pFLAG-h10A1 was created. DNA fragments for the amino-terminal region of human PDE10A2, the PDE10A1 amino-terminal region lacking 13 amino acids, the amino-terminal regions of rat PDE10A2 and PDE10A3 were amplified from human PDE10A2 cDNA (pBlue-PDE10A2) (14Kotera J. Fujishige K. Yuasa K. Omori K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), pBlue-PDE10A1, rat PDE10A2 cDNA (pGEMR10A) (12Fujishige K. Kotera J. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1118-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and a rat testis cDNA library (Clontech) by using a primer sets: 5′-AAAAAAGCTTATGGAAGATGGACCTTC-3′ plus 5′-GCTGTTTAGTTCATATACAACTCCC-3′, 5′-AAAAAAGCTTTTGACAGATGAAAAAGTG-3′ plus 5′-GCTGTTTAGTTCATATACAACTCCC-3′, 5′-AAAACTCGAGAAGCTTATGGAAGATGGACCCTC-3′ plus 5′-AGCTCGTACACGACTCCC-3′, and 5′-AAAACTCGAGAAGCTTATGAGCAATGACTCCCCAGAAGG-3′ plus 5′-AGCTCGTACACGACTCCC-3′, subcloned into pGEM-T Easy, and then sequenced, producing pGEM-H10A2N, pGEM-H10AΔ13N, pGEM-R10A2N, and pGEM-R10A3N, respectively. The HindIII-KpnI fragments of pGEM-H10A2N and pGEM-H10AΔ13N were ligated into the corresponding sites of pFLAG-h10A1, resulting in pFLAG-h10A2 and pFLAG-h10AΔ13, respectively. The HindIII-KpnI fragment of pGEM-R10A2N and pGEM-R10A3N were ligated with the 2.4-kb KpnI fragment of pGEM-R10A and the HindIII-KpnI-digested pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector, resulting in pFLAG-r10A2 and pFLAG-r10A3, coding for rat PDE10A2 and PDE10A3 cDNAs, respectively. The amino-terminal sequences of the recombinant human FLAG-PDE10A1, human FLAG-PDE10A2, human FLAG-PDE10AΔ13, rat FLAG-PDE10A2, and rat FLAG-PDE10A3 proteins are predicted to be MDYKDDDDKKLMRIE, MDYKDDDDKKLMEDG, MDYKDDDDKKLMLTD, MDYKDDDDKKLMEDG, and MDYKDDDDKKLMSND, respectively, where the underlined sequences containing a FLAG tag are added to the amino-terminal regions of the native forms.The expression plasmids pFLAG-cAK-Cα and pHisMax-cAK-Cα encoding the α isoform catalytic subunit of mouse PKA were a gift from Drs. Noriyuki Yanaka and Keizo Yuasa (Tanabe Seiyaku Co., Ltd.) (33Yuasa K. Michibata M. Omori K. Yanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37429-37434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An ATP-binding site of the PKA catalytic subunit was mutagenized from Lys169 to Ala169 using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primer sets 5′-CCTCATCTACCGGGACCTGGCGCCCGAGAATCTTC-3′ plus 5′-GAAGATTCTCGGGCGCCAGGTCCCGGTAGATGAGG-3′, resulting in pFLAG-cAK-Cα-K169A.A putative PKA phosphorylation site of human PDE10A2, which is located in the amino terminus, was mutagenized from RRLT to RRLA, RRLE, RRLS, RRLD, RRLK, and RRLG using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), pFLAG-h10A2 as a template, and the following primer sets: 5′-GCGAGCTGCTTCCGAAGGCTGGCCGAGTGCTTCC-3′ plus 5′-GGAAGCACTCGGCCAGCCTTCGGAAGCAGCTCGC-3′, 5′-GCGAGCTGCTTCCGAAGGCTGGAGGAGTGCTTCC-3′ plus 5′-GGAAGCACTCCTCCAGCCTTCGGAAGCAGCTCGC-3′, 5′-GCGAGCTGCTTCCGAAGGCTGACGGAGTGCTTCC-3′ plus 5′-GGAAGCACTCCGTCAGCCTTCGGAAGCAGCTCGC-3′, 5′-GCGAGCTGCTTCCGAAGGCTGGATGAGTGCTTCC-3′ plus 5′-GGAAGCACTCATCCAGCCTTCGGAAGCAGCTCGC-3′, 5′-GCGAGCTGCTTCCGAAGGCTGAAGGAGTGCTTCC-3′ plus 5′-GGAAGCACTCCTTCAGCCTTCGGAAGCAGCTCGC-3′, and 5′-GCGAGCTGCTTCCGAAGGCTGCAGGAGTGCTTCC-3′ plus 5′-GGAAGCACTCCTGCAGCCTTCGGAAGCAGCTCGC-3′, respectively. The mutations of expression plasmids were confirmed by sequencing, resulting in pFLAG-10A2-T16A, pFLAG-10A2-T16E, pFLAG-10A2-T16S, pFLAG-10A2-T16D, pFLAG-10A2-T16K, and pFLAG-10A2-T16G, respectively.Expression of PDE10A Variants in PC12h Cells—PC12h cells, a subclone of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, were kindly provided by Drs. Hiroshi Hatanaka and Masashi Yamada of Osaka University (34Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1981; 222: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). PC12h cells (6.3 × 105 cells/well) were cultured in poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well plates containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 2 μg/well of the PDE10A plasmid DNA (pFLAG-h10A1, pFLAG-h10A2, pFLAG-h10A2-T16A, pFLAG-h10A2-T16E, pFLAG-10A2-T16S, pFLAG-10A2-T16D, pFLAG-10A2-T16K, pFLAG-10A2-T16G, pFLAG-h10AΔ13, pFLAG-r10A2, or pFLAG-r10A3) were used for single transfection; and 0.5 μg/well of the PDE10A plasmid, 0.5 μg/well of the PKA plasmid, pFLAG-cAK-Cα, and 1μg/well of the pFLAG-CMV2 vector were used for co-transfection. 1 μg/well of the PDE10A plasmid and 1 μg/well of the PKA mutant plasmid, pFLAG-cAK-Cα-K169A, was used for co-transfection. All transfections were carried out by the LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped in 0.3 ml/well of ice-cold HB-A buffer with or without 50 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphoric acid disodium salt, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. In the case of phosphorylation studies on co-transfection of the PDE10A and PKA plasmids, the phosphatase inhibitors described above were added to the HB-A buffer. After cells were disrupted by a sonicator, cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared by ultracentrifugation using the HB-A buffer without and with 0.5% Triton X-100, respectively, as described above. Less than 10% of the total LDH activity was present in membrane fractions.Immunoblotting—Cytosolic and membrane fractions prepared from transfected cells or rat striatum were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). After blocking with 4% Block Ace (Snow Brand Milk Products, Tokyo, Japan) overnight, the blots were incubated with antibodies or antiserum and peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody. Visualization of bands was performed by the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). To measure relative amounts of the proteins, the autoradiogram was scanned and quantified by a PDI 420oe Scanner (PDI, Huntington, NY) and a Quantity One Program (PDI). Protein concentrations were determined by the Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—24 h after transfection with expression plasmids, PC12h cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at room temperature. The fixed cells were washed, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for single staining or 0.2% Triton X-100 for double staining, and incubated with anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution; Sigma) for 3 h or anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:160 dilution; Sigma) for 1 h and/or anti-TGN38 (trans-Golgi network 38) monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution; Transduction Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were washed with PBS, and then the cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-IgG antibody and/or rhodamine-conjugated anti-IgG antibody (Jackson Laboratories). The cells were washed with PBS and viewed by a confocal laser-scanning microscope (TCS-NT, Leica, Germany). The images shown in the figures are representative of those obtained from at least three independent immunostaining experiments. At least two images per experiment were taken, and more than 10 fields in each experiment were observed.In Vitro Phosphorylation of PDE10A by PKA—Relative amounts of FLAG-PDE10A proteins produced in COS-7 cells were estimated by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody as described previously (14Kotera J. Fujishige K. Yuasa K. Omori K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The amounts of the recombinant proteins were also confirmed by measuring their PDE activities. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped in ice-cold homogenization buffer HB-B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μl/ml aprotinin, and 1% Nonidet P-40). The cells were disrupted by a sonicator, and homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. High speed supernatants, which provided equal amounts of wild-type and mutant-type FLAG-tagged human PDE10A2 proteins (FLAG-PDE10A2 and FLAG-PDE10A2-T16A, respectively) were mixed with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and incubated at 4 °C overnight by rotation. The samples were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 1 min, and the pellets were washed three times with ice-cold HB-B buffer. The resultant pellets were resuspended with the HB-B buffer and then added to each tube. After centrifugation, the immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblotting and the PDE assay. FLAG-tagged PDE10A proteins providing equal optical densities by immunoblotting exhibited similar enzymatic activities (data not shown). The immunoprecipitated proteins showing equal amounts were phosphorylated at 30 °C for various times in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 200 μm ATP, 6.7 nm [γ-32P]ATP), 5 mm β-glycerophosphoric acid disodium salt, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing various concentrations of the catalytic subunit of bovine heart PKA (Promega). The phosphorylated mixtures were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 1 min. The pellets were resuspended in the Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1974; 222: 680-682Google Scholar) and boiled. The samples were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Isolation of Phosphorylated PDE10A—First, the specificity of isolation of phosphorylated PDE10A2 with a PhosphoProtein™ affinity column (Qiagen) was verified. FLAG-tagged PDE10A2 proteins produced in transfected COS-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with or without FLAG-tagged PKA catalytic subunit showing equal amounts of proteins by an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose in homogenization buffer HB-C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, Complete™ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.1% CHAPS) as described above. The immunoprecipitated proteins were phosphorylated at 30 °C for 1 h in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 200 μm ATP, 6.7 nm [γ-32P]ATP, and phosphatase inhibitor mix (Sigma)). After washes with the lysis buffer of a PhosphoProtein™ purification kit, FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted with 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide in the lysis buffer containing 0.25% CHAPS. The phosphorylated proteins in eluted solutions were separated with a PhosphoProtein™ affinity column according to the manufacturer's instructions, and eluted and flow-through fractions were concentrated to 400 μl using an Amicon filtration cell equipped with a PM-30 membrane (Amicon). These concentrated fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting and autoradiography. The autoradiography was performed by BAS2000 (Fujifilm).To isolate phosphorylated proteins from transfected PC12h cells, affinity column chromatography was performed using a PhosphoProtein™ purification kit. Transfected cells (3.8 × 106 cells) were disrupted by a sonicator in 0.9 ml of the lysis buffer of the kit without detergent, and homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used as cytosolic fractions. The pellets were resuspended with 0.9 ml of the lysis buffer containing 0.25% CHAPS. After sonication, the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants were designated as membrane fractions. The pellets were resuspended with 0.9 ml of the lysis buffer containing 0.25% CHAPS, resulting in insoluble fractions. Each fraction was subjected to immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody to confirm subcellular localization of the PDE10A proteins. The cytosolic and membrane fractions were mixed, and the protein concentrations of the mixtures were adjusted to 0"

The dominant crystalline mineral phase is pyrite, whereas greigite, the sulfide analog of magnetite, is present in lower proportions and accounts for the ferrimagnetism. The interior of the sclerites is penetrated by a pulp of pedal tissue that extends almost to the tip. Between the pulp and the outer mineralized layers there is a tough, laminated, organic layer, histologically indistinguishable from molluscan conchiolin. The conchiolin is studded with minute (typically about 1 m in diameter) iron sulfide granules and finely dispersed iron sulfur compounds; these minerals are more common in the outer layers of the conchiolin. Where the sclerite surface is overlain by adjacent sclerites, the sclerites are covered by a coat of bacteria (Fig. 1C; fig. S2G). Iron sulfide as a skeletal material is not known in metazoans (4), although accumulations of metal sulfides occur in animal tissues"
https://openalex.org/W1968946701,"The survival of renal medullary interstitial cells (RMICs) requires their adaptation to rapid shifts in ambient tonicity normally occurring in the renal medulla. Previous studies determined that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX 2) activation is critical for this adaptation. The present studies find that these adaptive mechanisms are dampened by the simultaneous activation of an apoptotic pathway linked to a glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK 3β). Inhibition of GSK 3 by LiCl or specific small molecule GSK inhibitors increased RMIC survival following hypertonic stress, and transduction of RMICs with a constitutively active GSK 3β (AdGSK 3βA9) significantly increased apoptosis, consistent with a proapoptotic role of GSK 3β. Following GSK 3β inhibition, increased survival was accompanied by increased COX 2 expression and COX 2 reporter activity. In contrast, GSK 3β overexpression reduced COX 2 reporter activity. Importantly, enhanced RMIC survival produced by GSK 3β inhibition was completely dependent on COX 2 because it was abolished by a COX 2-specific inhibitor, SC58236. The signaling pathway by which GSK 3β suppresses COX 2 expression was then explored. GSK 3β inhibition increased both NFκB and β-catenin activity associated with decreased IκB and increased β-catenin levels. The increase in COX 2 following GSK 3β inhibition was entirely blocked by NFκB inhibition using mutant IκB adenovirus. However, adenoviral overexpression of β-catenin did not increase COX 2 levels. These findings suggest that GSK 3β negatively regulates COX 2 expression and that GSK 3β inhibitors protect RMICs from hypertonic stress via induction of NFκB-COX 2-dependent pathway.

Hypertonic stress activates two opposing cellular signaling cascades that either lead to cell death or promote cell survival. The balance between these two pathways determines cell fate. Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the ability of renal medullary cells to survive hypertonic stress, including accumulation of organic osmolytes (4Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B.

Conversely, the mechanisms contributing to hypertonic stress-induced RMIC cell death are less clearly defined.GSK 3β signaling has been implicated in a variety of biological processes associated with altered cell survival and differentiation, including Wnt-associated developmental patterning and β-catenin-driven tumorigenesis (10Grimes C.A.

A link between GSK 3β activity and neuronal cell survival following hypertonic stress has also been suggested, though the downstream mechanisms of these effects are uncharacterized (18Stoothoff W.H. Johnson G.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 65: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Some data suggest that COX 2 is a downstream target of Wnt/GSK 3β/β-catenin signaling, promoting proliferation and tumorigenesis (19Howe L.R. Crawford H.C. Subbaramaiah K. Hassell J.A. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20108-20115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and previous studies have shown that COX 2 is critical for renal interstitial cell survival. The aim of the present study was to examine whether GSK 3β modulates renal medullary interstitial cell survival through a COX 2-dependent mechanism.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Rabbit medullary interstitial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin (20Hao C.M. Komhoff M. Guan Y. Redha R. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F352-F359PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2. Osmolality of the control medium was 330 mosmol/kg. Hyperosmotic medium was prepared by adding NaCl to achieve the indicated tonicity.Cell Viability Analysis—Cell viability was assessed using crystal violet (21Wang H. Li J. Bostock R.M. Gilchrist D.G. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 375-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Following hyperosmotic stress for predetermined time periods, culture medium was removed and plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The remaining viable attached cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 50% methanol for 15 min. The plates were then gently rinsed with water and dried. A solution containing 0.1 m citrate sodium in 20% methanol, pH 5.4, was added; 30 min later, the absorbance at 570 nm was read using a spectrophotometer. The percentage of cell survival was defined as the relative crystal violet absorbance of treated versus untreated cells. Remaining unattached cells in the medium were confirmed to be dead by a trypan blue exclusion assay.Caspase-3/7 Activity—Fluorometric assay of caspase-3/7 activity was conducted using an Apo-ONE™ homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay kit (Promega). This assay uses rhodamine 110, bis(N-CBZ-l-aspartyl-l-glu-tamyl-l-valyl-l-aspartic acid amide) (Z-DEVD-R110) as substrate. Cells were cultured in 12-well plates with 10% fetal bovine serum, which was substituted with serum-free medium for 2 h prior to experiment. Cells were subjected to hyperosmotic stress of varying tonicity for indicated periods of time and lysed using lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 5100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml of pepstatin, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). The protein concentration was measured by the bicinoconinic acid method. All measurements of caspase activity were carried out in triplicate in 96-well clear-bottom plate. Buffer and substrate were mixed at a proportion of 100:1 and incubated with cell lysate containing 20 μg of protein. Fluorescence was measured using a plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT) set at 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission. The amount of fluorescent product generated is proportional to the amount of caspase-3/7-cleavage activity present in the sample.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis of Apoptosis—The level of apoptosis was analyzed in living cultures using a combined annexin V-propidium iodide staining using a Vybrant™ apoptosis assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Briefly, cells were subjected to hypertonic stress in the presence or absence of GSK 3β inhibitors LiCl and SB 216763 for 8 h. Cells, including dead and floating cells, were harvested and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. 100 μl of 1 × 106/ml cells were taken for each assay and stained with PI and annexin V. Negative and positive controls were maintained individually for annexin V and PI. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACScan; BD Biosciences) (23Baskiewicz-Masiuk M. Masiuk M. Machalinski B. Cell Prolif. 2003; 36: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Li J. Kleeff J. Guo J. Fischer L. Giese N. Buchler M.W. Friess H. Mol. Cancer. 2003; 2: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in SDS Lamelli buffer. Protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninc acid protein assay (Sigma). Protein extract (20 μg) was loaded in each lane of a 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gel and run at 120 V. Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 22 V overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times with TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated in blocking buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% Carnation™ nonfat dry milk, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with anti-mouse antibodies for GSK-3β and β-catenin (1:2500 and 1:500, respectively; BD Transduction Laboratories) or anti-rabbit antibodies for pGSK (Ser-9) (1:1000; Cell Signaling), IκB-α (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and COX 2 (1:1000; Cayman) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After being washed three times, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 for anti-mouse and 1:10,000 for anti-rabbit) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three 15-min washings. Antibody labeling was visualized by addition of chemiluminescence reagent (Renaissance; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the membrane was exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film.GSK 3β Kinase Activity—Kinase activity of GSK 3β immunoprecipitated from cell lysate was analyzed in vitro. After being subjected to hypertonic stress for the indicated periods of time, cells were lysed on ice in freshly prepared buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg of aprotinin/ml, 5 μg of leupeptin/ml, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin LR). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge and precleared with protein G-Sepharose. 100 μg of total cellular protein diluted in lysis buffer was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-GSK 3β antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-rat GSK 3β) overnight by rocking incubation at 4 °C followed by addition of protein G-Sepharose and incubation for another 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μm microcystin LR), and twice with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EGTA). Activity of the immunoprecipitated GSK-3β was assayed in a total volume of 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 3.75 μg of phospho-glycogen synthase peptide 2, 15 μm cold ATP, and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP. After 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, 20 μl of SDS lysis buffer was added and incubated at 70 °C to stop the reaction. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged, and 15 μl of the supernatant was spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper. Filters were washed in three changes of 0.75% phosphoric acid, rinsed in acetone, dried, and 32p incorporation measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Non-phosphorylated glycogen synthase peptide was used as negative control, and nonspecific 32p incorporation was subtracted from values obtained using the phospho-glycogen synthase peptide.Reporter Gene Assay: β-Catenin-TCF/LEF, NFκB, and COX 2—β-Catenin-TCF/LEF reporter plasmid activity (generously provided by Drs. Kinzler and Volgelstein) (25Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H.

Following 24 h of growth, cells were transfected with β-catenin-TCF/LEF reporter and a plasmid containing Renilla luciferase driven by TK promoter using SuperFect (Qiagen). Forty-eight h post-transfection, cells were subjected to hypertonic stress in the presence or absence of GSK-3 inhibitors. After the indicated incubation time, cells were lysed and luciferase activity measured using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI).NFκB reporter plasmid containing firefly luciferase linked to 3 NFκB consensus sequences was a gift from Dr. Timothy Blackwell (26Blackwell T.S.

RMICs were seeded and transiently transfected as mentioned above. In some studies, cells were co-transfected with mouse GSK 3β cDNA. The mouse GSK 3β cDNA expressed sequence tag clone was obtained from Invitrogen. GSK 3β sequence was confirmed by complete nucleotide sequencing and subcloned into expression vector pCDNA 3.Transduction of RMICs with Recombinant GSK 3βA9, Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein, and IκB(mut) Adenovirus—AdGSK 3βA9, carrying a Ser-to-Ala substitution at Ser-9 in the NH2-terminal region of GSK 3β and a HA epitope tag at the COOH terminus was a gift from Dr. Thomas Force (28Haq S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The recombinant viruses were propagated in HEK 293 cells, and high titer stocks (∼2 × 1010 particles/ml) were purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. For infection of RMICs, virus of 30–100 multiplicity of infection was added to each culture dish.AdGFP was prepared as previously described (4Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1081-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). A full-length green fluorescent protein cDNA (Green Lantern or GL; Invitrogen) was subcloned into pACCMV. The pACCMV shuttle plasmid contains the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer and promoter and the SV40 polyadenylation sequence. The resulting shuttle plasmids were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells along with the pJM17 vector by SuperFect (Qiagen). AdGFP was generated by a homologous recombination event, resulting in plaque formation in the HEK 293 cells. The resulting infectious adenovirus was plaque-purified. 100 multiplicity of infection was added to each RMIC culture dish. After a 2-h incubation, the virus was removed and fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum added. Experiments were carried out 48–72 h after infectionAdIκB(mut) was constructed, amplified, and purified as described previously (20Hao C.M. Komhoff M. Guan Y. Redha R. Breyer M.D. Am. J.

The infectious AdIκB was generated by co-transfecting with pJM17 as described above.RESULTSHypertonic Stress Increases GSK 3β Activity in Cultured RMICs—Measurement of GSK 3β enzymatic activity using primed glycogen synthase as a substrate showed that hypertonic stress significantly increased GSK 3β activity in a time-dependent manner to 150% of that present in non-stressed cells within 10 min (150 ± 13 versus 100 ± 9; p <0.005, n = 4) and 171% by 30 min (171 ± 9.5 versus 100 ± 9; p <0.005, n = 4) (Fig. 1A). Acutely increasing the ambient tonicity from 300 to 550 mosm (addition of 125 mm NaCl) also reduced the immunoreactive inactive form of GSK 3β, phospho-GSK 3β, in cultured RMICs (Fig. 1B). Because total GSK 3β protein expression did not change, these findings are also consistent with increased GSK 3β activity following hypertonic stress.Increased GSK 3β Activity Is Associated with Apoptosis— Shifting tonicity from 300 to either 550 or 600 mosm reduced RMIC viability by 46 + 9% and 76 + 5.3%, respectively (Fig. 2A). GSK 3β inhibitor LiCl prevented hypertonic stress-induced cell death. LiCl (30 mm) potently inhibited GSK 3β, demonstrated by increased levels of inactive phospho-GSK 3β (Ser-9) (Fig. 2B). LiCl also increased RMIC viability following hypertonic stress to 80% of that observed in unstressed cells (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2A, effect of GSK 3β inhibitor LiCl on RMIC survival following hypertonic stress. RMICs were cultured to confluence and shifted to media with the indicated tonicity. Experiments were carried out in the presence (LiCL+) or absence (LiCl–) of LiCl. Following 12 h of hypertonic stress, cell survival was assessed using a crystal violet assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” *, p <0.00; **, p <0.0001 versus individual control. B, LiCl treatment increases pGSK 3β levels. Cultured RMICs were treated with LiCl (30 mm) for 6 and 12 h.

When the ambient tonicity was increased from 300 to 600 mosm, apoptosis as measured by caspase 3/7 activity increased 7-fold. Treatment with GSK 3β inhibitors significantly reduced caspase activity by 2–3-fold following hypertonic stress (600 mosm) (305 ± 63 n = 6, at 3 μm SB216763, and 214 ± 57 n = 6 at 5 μm SB216763 versus 692 + 93 in vehicle-treated cells, p <0.005 and p <0.001, respectively). Similar results were obtained with another GSK 3β inhibitor, SB415286, which at the concentrations of 20 and 30 μm reduced hypertonic stress-induced caspase activity in RMICs by 33 and 46%, respectively, (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3A, specific inhibitors of GSK decrease hypertonic stress-induced caspase activity. Cultured RMICs were treated with GSK 3β inhibitors, SB216763 (3 or 5 μm), SB415286 (20 or 30 μm), or LiCl (30 mm) and simultaneously subjected to hypertonic stress. Caspase activity was measured fluorometrically. *, p <0.05; **, p <0.001 versus control (vehicle). B, annexin-V and PI staining. Cultured RMICs were treated with GSK 3β inhibitors SB216763 (5 μm) or LiCl (30 mm) and simultaneously subjected to hypertonic stress for 8 h. 1 × 106 cells were stained with annexin and PI as described, followed by flow cytometry.

C, effect of constitutively active GSK 3β on caspase 3/7 activity. Cultured RMICs were transduced with GFP or GSK 3βA9 via adenoviral vector. 48 h later, caspase activity in whole-cell lysates was fluorometrically assayed as described. *, p <0.05; **, p <0.0001 versus AdGFP-infected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Flow cytometric analysis of relative levels of annexin V-PI staining of cells showed that within 8 h of hypertonic stress, 49% of cells become apoptotic compared with control (18%), with 32% cells in the early apoptotic stage and 10 and 7%, respectively, in the late apoptotic and necrotic stages. However, the apoptotic effects could be considerably decreased by simultaneously treating the cells with GSK 3β inhibitors (LiCl, 24%, and SB 216763, 19%) (Fig. 3B). These studies are consistent with a role for GSK 3β activity in promoting cell death following hypertonic stress.To further confirm the proapoptotic role of GSK 3β, caspase 3/7 activity was examined in unstressed RMICs transduced with a constitutively active GSK 3β adenovirus (AdGSK 3βA9). Transduction with AdGSK 3βA9 (30 and 100 multiplicity of infection) increased caspase activity above control AdGFP-transduced RMICs (368% ± 77 and 1043% ± 121 versus 100 ± 43, p <0.005 and p <0.0001, respectively) (Fig. 3C).Inhibition of GSK 3β Up-regulates COX 2 and Promotes Survival of RMICs following Hypertonic Stress—Previous studies suggest that COX 2-derived prostanoids play an important role in promoting RMIC survival following hypertonic stress (2Hao C.M.

All three GSK inhibitors increased COX 2 expression in cultured RMICs (Fig. 4A), suggesting GSK 3β activity tonically suppresses COX2 levels in RMICs. GSK 3β inhibitors also significantly increased COX 2 reporter activity in LiCl-treated (3-fold) and SB216763-treated (3.8-fold) RMICs (Fig. 4B). Conversely, RMICs transfected with a plasmid for wild type GSK 3β reduced COX 2 reporter activity to less than half of control (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Effect of GSK inhibitors on COX 2.A, COX 2 protein expression immunoblot.

https://openalex.org/W2015759736,"In response to environmental signals such as anoxia, many organisms enter a state of suspended animation, an extreme form of quiescence in which microscopically visible movement ceases. We have identified a gene, san-1, that is required for suspended animation in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. We show that san-1 functions as a spindle checkpoint component in C. elegans. During anoxia-induced suspended animation, embryos lacking functional SAN-1 or a second spindle checkpoint component, MDF-2, failed to arrest the cell cycle, exhibited chromosome missegregation, and showed reduced viability. These data provide a model for how a dynamic biological process is arrested in suspended animation."

The molecular basis of disease in patients with point mutations is less obvious. We have investigated the molecular properties of [L166P]DJ-1 and the novel variant [E64D]DJ-1. When transfected into non-neuronal and neuronal cell lines, steady-state expression levels of [L166P]DJ-1 were dramatically lower than wild-type [WT]DJ-1 and [E64D]DJ-1. Cycloheximide and pulse-chase experiments revealed that the decreased expression levels of [L166P]DJ-1 were because of accelerated protein turnover. Proteasomal degradation was not the major pathway of DJ-1 breakdown because treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 caused only minimal accumulation of DJ-1, even of the very unstable [L166P]DJ-1 mutant. Because of the structural resemblance of DJ-1 with bacterial cysteine proteases, we considered an autoproteolytic mechanism. However, neither pharmacological inhibition nor site-directed mutagenesis of the putative active site residue Cys-106 stabilized DJ-1.

Circular dichroism spectrometry revealed that the solution structures of [WT]DJ-1 and [E64D]DJ-1 are rich in β-strand and α-helix conformation. α-Helices were more susceptible to thermal denaturation than the β-sheet, and [WT]DJ-1 was more flexible in this regard than [E64D]DJ-1.

Although hereditary parkinsonism is very rare compared with sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; WT, wild type; CD, circular dichroism; PH, Pyrococcus horikoshii. 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; WT, wild type; CD, circular dichroism; PH, Pyrococcus horikoshii. the identification of PARK genes has greatly expanded the molecular understanding of the most common neurodegenerative movement disorders (1Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The discovery of PARK1/α-SYNUCLEIN has led to the identification of α-synuclein fibrils as the neuropathological hallmark of PD, and the investigation of α-synuclein has provided important clues to the molecular mechanisms of PD (2Kahle P.J.

Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 14-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Moreover, two enzymes involved in ubiquitin metabolism were found to be encoded by PARK2 (the ubiquitin ligase parkin) and PARK5 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1), suggesting that failure of the ubiquitin-proteasome system generally contributes to PD (4McNaught K.S.P. Olanow C.W. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: S73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). More recently, DJ-1 was identified to be the gene mutated in the PARK7 locus (5Bonifati V.

Loss-of-function mutations of DJ-1 are compatible with the recessive inheritance of PARK7 (6van Duijn C.M. Dekker M.C.J. Bonifati V. Galjaard R.J. Houwing-Duistermaat J.J. Snijders P.J.L.M.

More recently, a second point mutation (E64D) was found in a small kindred of Turkish ancestry. 2R. Hering, C. Strauss, X. Tao, A. Bauer, E.-M. Mietz, S. Petrovic, P. Bauer, W. Schaible, D.

Subclinical PD was indicated by reduction of [18F]FP-CIT positron emission in a homozygous sister, whereas a heterozygous brother had normal [18F]FP-CIT uptake. Five more siblings as well as the heterozygous mother were unaffected. To elucidate the molecular basis of the deficits of DJ-1 point mutations, the expression, processing, and turnover of WT and mutant DJ-1 were examined. Expression levels of mutant [L166P]DJ-1 were significantly reduced compared with [WT]DJ-1 (20Miller D.W. Ahmad R. Hague S. Baptista M.J. Canet-Aviles R. McLendon C. Carter D.M. Zhu P.-P. Stadler J.

Cycloheximide and pulse-chase experiments with transiently transfected human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells revealed that [L166P]DJ-1 was degraded much more rapidly than [WT]DJ-1 and [E64D]DJ-1. WT and mutant DJ-1 minimally accumulated in the presence of MG-132, suggesting the existence of a major non-proteasomal DJ-1 degradation pathway. Because of structural resemblance of DJ-1 with Pyrococcus horikoshii PH1704 class cysteine proteases (17Honbou K. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M. Niki T. Taira T. Ariga H. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31380-31384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we considered an autoproteolytic mechanism of [L166P]DJ-1 breakdown. However, neither pharmacological inhibition nor site-directed mutagenesis of the putative active site cysteine 106 to alanine stabilized DJ-1. Furthermore, we found that the solution structures of [WT]DJ-1 and [E64D]DJ-1 were rich in α-helix and β-sheet, but α-helical elements were more susceptible to thermal denaturation in [WT]DJ-1 than in [E64D]DJ-1. Thus, the L166P mutation enhances cellular breakdown and depletion of DJ-1, whereas the structural defects of [E64D]DJ-1 are more subtle and might become apparent only under stress conditions. We conclude that Parkinson's disease in PARK7 patients is caused by a depletion of functionally active DJ-1 protein. Antibodies—DJ-1 was probed with mouse monoclonal anti-V5 (Invitrogen), mouse monoclonal Penta-His (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and mouse monoclonal anti-DJ-1 (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), or polyclonal antiserum against DJ-1 (gift of H. Ariga, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan), followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG, respectively (Sigma). Western blots were normalized by reprobing with anti-β-actin (Sigma). Efficacy of proteasome inhibitors was demonstrated with mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Site-directed Mutagenesis—[WT]DJ-1 and [L166P]DJ-1 (5Bonifati V.

The two resulting PCR products were then used as templates for a PCR using NcoI forward primer (see above) and BamHI stop reverse primer (see above). The mutagenized PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany). Generation of the [E64D]DJ-1 construct in the same vector was described elsewhere. 2R. Hering, C. Strauss, X. Tao, A. Bauer, E.-M. Mietz, S. Petrovic, P. Bauer, W. Schaible, D. Woitalla, T.

Eukaryotic DJ-1 Expression and Inhibitor Treatments—HEK293 cells, SY5Y cells, and MN9D cells were grown to near confluence and transiently transfected with eukaryotic expression constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 in opti-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) (DNA:lipid ratio 1:2.5). Two days after transfection, cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), 10 μm MG-132 (Calbiochem), 50 μm leupeptin (Roche Diagnostics), or directly lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) plus Cømplete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Protein content in the lysates was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. After denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). Western blots were probed with the antibodies listed below, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Pulse-Chase Labeling—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected as above. One day after transfection, the cells were starved in methionine/cysteine-free minimum essential medium (Sigma) plus 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% l-glutamine for one hour. They were then pulsed for 3 h with 75 μCi/ml [35S]Met/[35S]Cys (Promix; Amersham Biosciences), rinsed, and chased with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA, Pasching, Austria) plus 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% l-glutamine, 1 mml-methionine, and 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7,6) plus Cømplete protease inhibitor mixture. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-V5 and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the gels were fixed, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), and dried. The radiolabeled proteins were visualized on BioMax film (Kodak, Rochester, New York). RT-PCR Determination of DJ-1 mRNA—Total RNA was extracted from transfected cells with Trizol (peQLab, Erlangen, Germany) and reverse-transcribed using superScript II and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNAs were PCR-amplified using NcoI forward primer (see above) and BamHI V5 tag reverse primer (see below). Amplification rates were linear at 25 cycles, as visualized on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Bacterial DJ-1 Expression and Purification—[WT]DJ-1 and mutant DJ-1 cDNAs (see above) were amplified in polymerase chain reactions using the following primers: NcoI forward primer (see above), BamHI V5 tag reverse primer 5′-ATCTGGATCCCGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAG-3′, and BamHI reverse primer 5′-ATCTGGATCCGTCTTTAAGAACAAGTGGAGC-3′. After subcloning into pQE-60 (Qiagen), the prokaryotic expression constructs were used to transform E. coli BL21/RIL. All constructs were sequenced (GATC Biotech). Bacterial cultures were induced with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 5 h. The pelleted bacteria were French-pressed into phosphate-buffered saline containing Cømplete protease inhibitors. Imidazole was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and this lysate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen). The HIS-tagged DJ-1 proteins eluted in a linear gradient (20-500 mm) around 0.1 m imidazole as broad peaks that were concentrated in Centriprep-3 devices (Millipore). The concentrates were loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in 5% glycerol, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0). DJ-1/HIS proteins eluted earlier than expected for globular proteins with molecular mass 21.3 kDa (low molecular weight gel filtration calibration markers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences), consistent with the dimeric structure of native DJ-1. Peak integrations of analytical Source 5 reverse phase HPLC runs revealed at least 90% purity of the DJ-1 preparations. Mass Spectrometry—DJ-1 was diluted to 0.01-0.5 mg/ml with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Two μl of this solution were mixed with 1 μl of sinapinic acid (Fluka) saturated in 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid in 30% acetonitrile as matrix. One μl was deposited on a stainless steel target plate. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectra were recorded in the linear mode on a Voyager DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) with 25,000 V accelerating voltage. 3-5 × 100 laser shots were collected from different positions and added. CD Spectrometry—Protein solutions were scanned in a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette using a J-810 CD spectrophotometer (Jasco). Temperature in the measuring cell was gradually increased, and at defined temperature intervals CD spectra were taken from 300-190 nm. Secondary structure was calculated using the Jasco JWSSE-480 software (least squares method Yang). Expression of WT and Mutant DJ-1 in Eukaryotic Cells—To study the cellular expression of DJ-1, plasmids encoding [WT]DJ-1 and mutant DJ-1 with a C-terminal-fused V5/HIS tag were transfected into HEK293 cells. Two days after transfection, the expression levels relative to β-actin were found to be much lower for [L166P]DJ-1 than [WT]DJ-1 and [E64D]DJ-1, as evidenced from Western blots probed with anti-V5 (Fig. 1). Probing with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against DJ-1 revealed that the expression levels of transfected [WT]DJ-1 were comparable with endogenous DJ-1 levels, whereas [L166P]DJ-1 levels were dramatically reduced (Fig. 1). RT-PCR analysis of the transfected DJ-1 mRNAs revealed that all constructs were robustly expressed. Thus, [L166P]DJ-1 was lost at the protein level and not because of inefficient transcription or mRNA lability. [E64D]DJ-1 was expressed slightly less than [WT]DJ-1. Surprisingly, monoclonal 3E8 anti-DJ-1 did not recognize the [E64D]DJ-1 protein (Fig. 1). Longer exposures of higher resolution blots provided evidence for cell type-specific processing of transfected DJ-1. The antibody against the C-terminal V5 tag visualized two truncated DJ-1 species (ΔN1 and ΔN2) in non-neuronal HEK293 cells but not in neuroblastoma SY5Y cells and immortalized dopaminergic neuronal MN9D cells (Fig. 2). The ratio of these N-terminal-truncated DJ-1 fragments to full-length DJ-1 was much higher for [L166P]DJ-1. In addition, the C-terminal V5 epitope could be cleaved off from transfected DJ-1 to produce band ΔC, which was visualized only with antibodies against DJ-1 (see Figs. 3 and 4).Fig. 3Accelerated turnover of [L166P]DJ-1. V5-tagged [WT]DJ-1 (left panels), [L166P]DJ-1 (middle panels), and [E64D]DJ-1 (right panels) were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. A, for pulse-chase experiments, cells were incubated with 35S-labeled cysteine/methionine for 3 h and chased with non-radioactive medium for the times indicated at the bottom. Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5. The immunoprecipitated DJ-1/V5/HIS proteins were separated on denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. B, for translational inhibition, cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for the times indicated at the bottom. Cell lysates (20 μg for [WT]DJ-1 and [E64D]DJ-1, 50 μg for [L166P]DJ-1) were sequentially Western probed with monoclonal antibodies against the V5 epitope (upper panels), DJ-1 (middle panels), and β-actin (lower panels). Note that a long (15-min) exposure is shown to match the t = 0 V5 signal from the low-expressing [L166P]DJ-1 with those from [WT]DJ-1 and [E64D]DJ-1 (3-s exposure). This experiment was repeated three times with similar results, although this particular experiment showed the fastest V5 decay of [E64D]DJ-1.

V5/HIS-tagged [WT]DJ-1 (left panels), [L166P]DJ-1 (middle panels), and [E64D]DJ-1 (right panels) were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Two days post-transfection, the cells were treated with 10 μm MG-132 for the times indicated at the bottom. DJ-1 in cell lysates (20 μg for [WT]DJ-1 and [E64D]DJ-1, 50 μg for [L166P]DJ-1) was detected with anti-V5 as well as with polyclonal antiserum and 3E8 monoclonal against DJ-1, as indicated to the left. Efficacy of proteasomal inhibition was demonstrated by the accumulation of β-catenin, equal loading, and cellular viability by even β-actin immunoreactivity (lower panels). A long (10-min) exposure is shown to match the t = 0 V5 signal from the low-expressing [L166P]DJ-1 with those from [WT]DJ-1 and [E64D]DJ-1 (3-s exposure).

To test whether rapid degradation could account for the loss of mutant DJ-1 protein, pulse-chase experiments were performed. Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were pulse-labeled with a mixture of [35S]cysteine/methionine and chased with non-radioactive medium up to 24 h. Radiolabeled transfected DJ-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5. [WT]DJ-1 was found to be a very stable protein. There was practically no breakdown of [WT]DJ-1 for 6-8 h, with little further decay up to 24 h (Fig. 3A). [E64D]DJ-1 was an equally stable protein. In contrast, the degradation of [L166P]DJ-1 protein was dramatically accelerated. [L166P]DJ-1 was degraded within 4-8 h, although it was translated as efficiently as [WT]DJ-1 as evidenced by the comparable incorporation of 35S-labeled amino acids at the 0-h chase time point. Thus, the dramatic reduction of [L166P]DJ-1 steady-state levels is not because of poor translation. Moreover, the 0-h chase time point showed only full-length [L166P]DJ-1. Both N-terminal-truncated [L166P]DJ-1 fragments ΔN1 and ΔN2 were cleaved from the full-length precursor protein within 4-6 h after translation, demonstrating that the N-terminal processing of [L166P]DJ-1/V5/HIS is a rapid event. To confirm that the reduced steady-state expression of [L166P]DJ-1 was because of accelerated protein degradation and to measure the turnover of endogenous DJ-1, protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide and the decay of DJ-1 proteins was monitored over a time course of 12 h. Like the endogenous DJ-1, transfected [WT]DJ-1 and [E64D]DJ-1 remained fully stable for 6 h with little further decay (Fig. 3B). In striking contrast, full-length [L166P]DJ-1 immunoreactivity completely vanished within 4 h (Fig. 3B), but the N-terminal-truncated DJ-1 species ΔN1 and ΔN2 remained stable throughout the 12-h time course. Expression of mutant DJ-1 had no significant influence on the turnover of endogenous DJ-1. Proteasomal and Autoproteolytic DJ-1 Degradation Pathways—Our results indicate that [WT]DJ-1 is a rather stable protein with relatively slow turnover. Indeed, blocking the major cellular protein degradation machinery (the proteasome) (22Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar) with MG-132 did not lead to an accumulation of [WT]DJ-1 in transiently transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 4). MG-132 treatment did not cause DJ-1 accumulation in stably transfected cells either (data not shown). Furthermore, accumulation of the endogenous DJ-1 was not found in MG-132-treated cells (Fig. 4). Likewise, the relatively stable mutant [E64D]DJ-1 did not accumulate in MG-132-treated HEK293 cells (Fig. 4). It has been proposed that the enhanced turnover of [L166P]DJ-1 was (at least in part) because of proteasomal degradation (20Miller D.W. Ahmad R. Hague S. Baptista M.J. Canet-Aviles R. McLendon C. Carter D.M. Zhu P.-P. Stadler J. Chandran J. Klinefelter G.R. Blackstone C. Cookson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36588-36595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, MG-132 treatment only minimally increased the levels of [L166P]DJ-1, although the proteasome was effectively blocked in our system as evidenced by the massive accumulation of β-catenin, a protein that is rapidly turned over in the proteasome (23Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar). Rather, the N-terminal-truncated [L166P]DJ-1 fragments ΔN1 and ΔN2 appeared to be stabilized upon proteasomal inhibition. Thus, there must exist proteolytic pathways for DJ-1 in addition to the proteasome. To study alternative, non-proteasomal DJ-1 breakdown pathways, we inhibited cellular cysteine proteases in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with DJ-1 with leupeptin. However, leupeptin treatment did not lead to significant accumulation of DJ-1 (Fig. 5A), although probing for co-transfected amyloid precursor protein revealed the expected accumulation of C-terminal stubs (not shown) because of efficient cysteine protease inhibition (24Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Specifically, the highly unstable [L166P]DJ-1 protein was not stabilized by inhibition of cellular cysteine proteases. Another cysteine protease inhibitor, E64, did not stabilize DJ-1 either (results not shown). To assess the autoproteolytic potential of DJ-1 more directly, we replaced the putative active-site cysteine 106 (17Honbou K. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M. Niki T. Taira T. Ariga H. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31380-31384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. When transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, the steady-state levels of [C106A]DJ-1 were not significantly elevated compared with [WT]DJ-1 (Fig. 5B). Likewise, introduction of the C106A active-site mutation did not stabilize [L166P]DJ-1. The steady-state expression levels of the double mutant [C106A/L166P]DJ-1 were as low as those of the single mutant [L166P]DJ-1 despite the strong expression of their mRNAs (Fig. 5B). Thus, the imperfectly conserved catalytic cleft around cysteine 106 of DJ-1, which is topologically equivalent to the catalytic cysteine residue of PH1704-type proteases, does not contribute to the rapid degradation of mutant [L166P]DJ-1. In other words, the fast breakdown of [L166P]DJ-1 is not because of derepressed self-digestion. Interestingly, however, the C106A mutation increased the appearance of a DJ-1 immunoreactive band that migrated at an apparent molecular mass expected for a dimer (Fig. 5B).

https://openalex.org/W2062239193,"In the present study, we verified that the mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) receptor is modified by palmitic acid, which is covalently attached to the protein through a thioester-type bond. Palmitoylation efficiency was not modulated by receptor stimulation with agonists. Block of protein synthesis by cycloheximide resulted in a significant reduction of receptor acylation, suggesting that palmitoylation occurs early after synthesis of the 5-HT1A receptor. Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that fatty acids are stably attached to the receptor. Two conserved cysteine residues 417 and 420 located in the proximal C-terminal domain were identified as acylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis. To address the functional role of 5-HT1A receptor acylation, we have analyzed the ability of acylation-deficient mutants to interact with heterotrimeric Gi protein and to modulate downstream effectors. Replacement of individual cysteine residues (417 or 420) resulted in a significantly reduced coupling of receptor with Gi protein and impaired inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. When both palmitoylated cysteines were replaced, the communication of receptors with Gαi subunits was completely abolished. Moreover, non-palmitoylated mutants were no longer able to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation, indicating that palmitoylation of the 5-HT1A receptor is critical for the enabling of Gi protein coupling/effector signaling. The receptor-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase was also affected by acylation-deficient mutants, suggesting the importance of receptor palmitoylation for the signaling through the Gβγ-mediated pathway, in addition to the Gαi-mediated signaling.

With the exception of the 5-HT3 receptor, which is a transmitter-gated Na+/K+ channel, all other 5-HT receptors belong to a large family of receptors that are coupled to different intracellular effectors via heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) (1Boess F.G. Martin I.L. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 275-317Google Scholar, 2Barnes N.M. Sharp T. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1083-1152Google Scholar). Structurally, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) possess seven transmembrane domains linked by alternating intracellular (i1–i3) and extracellular (e1–e4) loops. The extracellular receptor surface, including the N terminus, is known to be critically involved in ligand binding. The intracellular receptor surface, including the C-terminal domain and intracellular loops (in particular i2 and i3), is known to be important for G protein recognition and activation (3Wess J. Faseb J. 1997; 11: 346-354Google Scholar). 5-hydroxytryptamine or serotonin mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor G protein-coupled receptors adenylyl cyclase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin phosphate-buffered saline Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate chinese hamster ovary wild type hemagglutinin. The 5-HT1A receptor is the most extensively characterized 5-HT receptor. This receptor is coupled to a variety of effectors via pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi/o families (2Barnes N.M. Sharp T.

Receptor-dependent activation of Gαi subunits results in the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and subsequent decrease of cAMP levels in both hippocampal neurons (6De Vivo M. Maayani S. J. Pharmacol.

Analysis of G protein specificity for the 5-HT1A receptor revealed an unexpected complexity. Antisense depletion of different subtypes of the Gαi subunit revealed that removal of Gαi1 eliminated 5-HT1A-induced inhibition of basal cAMP levels, whereas depletion of Gαi2 and Gαi3 blocked the 5-HT1A receptor action on Gs-activated adenylyl cyclase (AC) (11Liu Y.F. Ghahremani M.H. Rasenick M.M. Jakobs K.H. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16444-16450Google Scholar). Expression studies in Sf.9 insect cells have also provided the first evidence for possible post-translational modifications of the 5-HT1A receptor (12Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Google Scholar). Besides effects mediated by Gαi/o subunits, activation of the 5-HT1A receptor leads to a Gβγ-mediated activation of K+ current and inhibition of Ca2+ current in hippocampal neurons (13Zgombick J.M.

A. 1991; 88: 5694-5698Google Scholar). In CHO cells, the 5-HT1A receptor also mediates Gβγ-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C as well as activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk2 (8Fargin A. Raymond J.R. Regan J.W.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13716-13722Google Scholar). Considerable interest has been raised from pharmacological studies indicating a role for the 5-HT1A receptor in regulating anxiety states, and the production of knock-out mice lacking this receptor has confirmed these expectations (18Ramboz S. Oosting R. Amara D.A. Kung H.F. Blier P. Mendelsohn M. Mann J.J. Brunner D. Hen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14476-14481Google Scholar, 19Heisler L.K. Chu H.M. Brennan T.J. Danao J.A.

A. 1998; Vol. 95: 10734-10739Google Scholar). The covalent attachment of fatty acids to proteins (acylation) is a widespread post-translational modification (21Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Google Scholar). Two main modes of acylation have been described: N-myristoylation and palmitoylation (S-acylation). N-myristoylation is a co-translational modification catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferase, which modifies glycine residues located within a consensus sequence at the protein N terminus via an amide linkage (22Boutin J.A. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 15-35Google Scholar). Contrary to myristoylation, the addition of long chain fatty acids (mainly palmitic acid) is a post-translational event, which occurs through covalent linkage of palmitate via a labile thioester bond to cysteine residues. In contrast to the myristoylation, the molecular machinery responsible for palmitoylation of proteins is only poorly understood. In fact, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic S-acylation reaction mechanisms have been proposed, and recent reports on protein palmitoyltransferases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster provided the first glimpse of enzymes that carry out protein palmitoylation (23Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Biochemistry. 2003; Vol. 42: 4311-4320Google Scholar). Palmitoylation is unique among lipid modifications as it can be reversible and adjustable. Among the cellular palmitoylated proteins, polypeptides involved in signal transduction e.g. GPCRs, α subunits of G proteins, Ras protein, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, adenylyl cyclase, phospholypase C, and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, are often targets for such dynamic modification (24Bouvier M. Moffett S. Loisel T.P. Mouillac B. Hebert T. Chidiac P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 116-120Google Scholar, 25Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Google Scholar, 26Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 32-42Google Scholar). Meanwhile it is widely accepted that repeated cycles of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation can be critically involved in regulation of different signaling processes (27Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 107-109Google Scholar, 28Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Google Scholar, 29Cramer H. Schmenger K. Heinrich K. Horstmeyer A. Boning H. Breit A. Piiper A. Lundstrom K. Muller-Esterl W. Schroeder C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5449-5459Google Scholar). In the GPCRs, palmitoylation has been shown to be responsible for a wide variety of biological functions (24Bouvier M. Moffett S. Loisel T.P. Mouillac B. Hebert T. Chidiac P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 116-120Google Scholar, 27Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 107-109Google Scholar, 28Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Google Scholar, 30Bouvier M. Chidiac P. Hebert T.E.

For example, prevention of palmitoylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor leads to an increase of basal receptor phosphorylation and rapid desensitization in response to agonist stimulation (32Moffett S. Mouillac B. Bonin H. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 349-356Google Scholar). Substitution of palmitoylated cysteine residues in the muscarinic acetylcholine m2 receptor reduces its ability to couple to the Gi protein (33Hayashi M.K. Haga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 376-382Google Scholar). We have recently shown that palmitoylation of the 5-HT4(a) receptor is involved in the modulation of the constitutive receptor activity (34Ponimaskin E.G. Heine M. Joubert L. Sebben M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Dumuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2534-2546Google Scholar). For several GPCRs palmitoylation has been revealed to be modulated by agonist stimulation (33Hayashi M.K. Haga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 376-382Google Scholar, 35Hawtin S.R. Tobin A.B.

J. 2001; 353: 627-634Google Scholar), whereas for the human A1 adenosine receptor, the efficacy of palmitoylation was not affected by the agonist (37Gao Z. Ni Y. Szabo G. Linden J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 387-395Google Scholar). Moreover, stimulation of several GPCRs may modulate palmitoylation of receptor-coupled G proteins (38Gurdal H. Seasholtz T.M. Wang H.Y. Brown R.D. Johnson M.D. Friedman E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 1064-1070Google Scholar, 39Mumby S.M. Muntz K.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 156-160Google Scholar, 40Chen C.A. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the recombinant 5-HT1A receptor is modified by covalently attached palmitate. Palmitoylation efficiency was not affected by agonist stimulation, and blockade of protein synthesis by cycloheximide resulted in a significant reduction of the receptor acylation. By site-directed mutagenesis, cysteine residues 417 and 420 located in the cytoplasmic C terminus were identified as acylation sites. Using acylation-deficient mutants, we also were able to verify a functional significance of 5-HT1A receptor palmitoylation for the coupling to the Gαi as well as with Gβγ subunits and for the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation. Materials—[9,10-3H(N)]Palmitic acid (30–60 Ci/mmol), [35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol), and Tran[35S]-label (>1000Ci/mmol) were purchased from Hartmann Analytic GmbH (Germany). [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulfate, ECL® Western blotting Analysis System and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies raised against phosphorylated Erk1/2 (phospho-p42/44) and against total Erk (p42/44) were from New England Biolabs. Enzymes used in molecular cloning were obtained from New England Biolab. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads, 5-HT, and F-12 Ham medium were from Sigma. TC-100 insect cell medium, Cellfectin® Reagent, LipofectAMINE 2000® reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. The 8-OH-DPAT was purchased from Tocris. Cell culture dishes were ordered from Nunc. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. AmpliTaq® DNA Polymerase was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Recombinant DNA Procedures—All basic DNA procedures were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The m5-HT1A cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Paul R. Albert (Ottawa, Canada). The m5-HT1A cDNA was amplified with specific primers HA-1A-sence (5′-GGAGTGG TACCCACCAT GGATTACCCA TACGACGTCC C AGACTACGC TATGGATATG TTCAGTCTTGGC-3′) and 1A-antisence (5′-CAGGGGGTAC CTATTGAGTG AACAGGAAGGGTC-3′) to create 9 amino acids HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) at the N terminus of the receptor. The PCR fragment was ligated to the KpnI site of the multiple cloning sites of pcDNA 3.1(–) or pFastBac plasmid (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis of the epitope-tagged 5-HT1A receptor with the substitution of serine for cysteine at position 417 and/or 420 was performed by overlap extension PCR technique using an oligonucleotide containing the mutation(s) corresponding to the above substitutions (43Ponimaskin E. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 370-374Google Scholar). The recombinant baculoviruses encoding for HA-5-HT1A mutants were constructed, purified, and amplified as described previously (44Veit M. Nurnberg B. Spicher K. Harteneck C. Ponimaskin E. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 160-164Google Scholar). All mutants were verified by dideoxy DNA sequencing of the final plasmid. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf.9) cells were grown in TC-100 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (complete TC-100). For expression, Sf.9 cells (1.5 × 106) grown in 3.5 mm dishes were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding for HA-tagged 5-HT1A receptor at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 pfu per cell. After 48 h, Sf.9 cells were labeled with Tran[35S]-label (50 μCi/ml, >1000) or [3H]-palmitic acid (300 μCi/ml, 30–60 Ci/mmol) for the time periods indicated in figure legends. In some experiments, 5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT were added to the final concentrations as indicated in figure legends. To block protein synthesis, cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) was added 10 min prior to incubation with [3H]palmitate or [35S]methionine. For the pulse-chase experiments cells were subsequently incubated with complete TC-100 medium supplemented with 100 μm unlabeled palmitate and 50 μm sodium pyruvate. After labeling, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm KH2PO4, 6 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and lysed in 600 μl of NTEP buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was pelleted (5 min, 20.000 × g), and anti-HA antibodies were added to the resulting supernatant at a dilution of 1:60. After overnight agitation at 4 °C, 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was added, and samples were incubated under gentle rocking for 2 h. After brief centrifugation, the pellet was washed twice with ice-cold NTEP-buffer, and the immunocomplexes were released from the beads by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in non-reducing electrophoresis sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 20% glycerol, 6% SDS, and 0.002% bromphenol blue). Radiolabeled polypeptides were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels under non-reducing condition and visualized by fluorography using Kodak X-Omat AR films. Densitometric analysis of fluorograms was performed by Gel-Pro Analyser Version 3.1 Software. Hydroxylamine Treatment and Fatty Acid Analysis—Gels containing the 5-HT1A receptor labeled with [3H]palmitic acid were fixed (10% acetic acid, 10% methanol) and treated overnight under gentle agitation with 1 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.5) or 1 m Tris (pH 7.5). Gels were then washed in water and rocked for 30 min in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to wash out cleaved fatty acids before they were processed for fluorography. For the fatty acid analysis, the [3H]palmitate-labeled 5-HT1A receptor was purified by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. The band corresponding to the receptor protein was excised, and fatty acids were cleaved by treatment of the dried gel slices with 6 n HCl for 16 h at 110 °C. Fatty acids were then extracted with hexane and separated into individual fatty acid species by thin layer chromatography using acetonitrile/acetic acid (1:1, v/v) as solvent. Radiolabeled fatty acid was visualized by fluorography. Indirect Immunofluorescence—At 48 h after infection with recombinant 5-HT1A baculovirus or with baculovirus wild-type, Sf.9 cells grown on coverslips were fixed with paraformaldehyde (3% in PBS) for 15 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS and paraformaldehyde was quenched with 50 mm glycine for 15 min. Cells were then permeabilized with saponin and incubated for 1 h with the anti-HA antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The second antibody (Alexa546 from Alexa diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin) was applied for 1 h, and unbound antibodies were washed off at every step with PBS. Finally, coverslips were mounted in 90% (v/v) glycerol. Cells were monitored under a confocal laser-scan microscope LSM510 (Zeiss). Intracellular distribution of the receptors in CHO cells was analyzed as described by Ponimaskin et al. (34Ponimaskin E.G. Heine M. Joubert L. Sebben M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Dumuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2534-2546Google Scholar). Assay for [35S]GTPγS Binding—Agonist-promoted binding of [35S]guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate to different G proteins induced by stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors was performed according to the method described previously (43Ponimaskin E. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 370-374Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes from Sf.9 cells expressing the 5-HT1A receptor wild-type or acylation-deficient mutants and G protein α subunits (Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, Gs, G12, G13) together with β1γ2 subunits were resuspended in 55 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm GDP. After adding [35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol) to a final concentration of 30 nm, samples were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 1 μm 5-HT. The reaction was terminated by adding 600 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0,5% Nonidet P-40, 200 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm GDP, and 100 μm GTP for 30 min on ice. Samples were agitated for 1 h at 4 °C after addition of 100 μl of 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose and 10 μl of antibodies directed against appropriate Gα subunits. Antibodies directed against Gαi, Gαs, and Gα13 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For the precipitation of Gα12 subunits, antibody AS1905 (43Ponimaskin E. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 370-374Google Scholar) was used. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times, boiled in 0.5 ml of 0.5% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Assay for [3H]5-HT Binding—The membranes from Sf.9 cells expressing WT or mutated 5-HT1A receptors were dissolved in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The binding assay with [3H]5-HT was performed as described previously (12Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Google Scholar, 45Hall M.D. el Mestikawy S. Emerit M.B. Pichat L. Hamon M. Gozlan H. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 1685-1696Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.7), 0.1% ascorbic acid, 20 μm pargyline, and 1–250 nm of [3H]5-HT was added to 20 μg of the membrane fraction. Nonspecific binding was determined by addition of 100 μm unlabeled 5-HT. After a 30-min incubation at 20 °C, the reaction mixture was loaded on 20-μm PVDF membranes (Corning, Germany) presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine. The membranes were washed with ice-cold binding buffer, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counter. Data were fitted with the one-site saturation binding model by the Pharmacology module of SigmaPlot 8.02 software (46SigmaPlot 8.02. (2002) SPSS Inc., ChicagoGoogle Scholar). Cell Transfection and cAMP Assay—The 5-HT1A receptor wild-type and acylation-deficient mutants cDNAs were cloned in pcDNA3(–) vector and transfected in NIH3T3 cells by electroporation. Cells were diluted in DMEM (106 cells/ml) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (dFBS) and plated into 12-well clusters. Six hours after transfection, cells were incubated overnight in DMEM without dFBS containing 2 μCi [3H]adenine/ml to label the ATP pool. Cells were washed and then incubated in 1 ml of culture medium containing 0.75 mm IBMX, 50 μm forskolin plus the drugs indicated in the figure legends for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by replacing the medium with 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. The cAMP accumulation was measured as described previously (7Dumuis A. Sebben M. Bockaert J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 178-186Google Scholar). The amount of the expressed 5-HT1A receptor was measured as described in Varrault et al. (47Varrault A. Journot L. Audigier Y. Bockaert J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 999-1007Google Scholar). Erk2 Phosphorylation Assay—CHO cells were grown in F-12 Ham medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For expression, CHO cells (0.5 × 106) grown in 3.5-mm dishes were transfected with recombinant 5-HT1A receptor using LipofectAMINE2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty hours after transfection, cells were starved in F-12 Ham medium with 2% bovine serum albumin and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 16 h. Cells were then stimulated for 5 min with 10 μm 8-OH-DPAT at 37 °C under 5% CO2, washed with PBS and lysed in the loading buffer. Equal amounts of proteins in lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to Western blot. The membranes were probed either with antibodies raised against phosphorylated Erk1/2 (phospho-p42/44; 1:2000 dilution) or against total Erk (p42/44; 1:1000 dilution). To analyze the receptor expression, membranes were probed with antibodies raised against the HA epitope (1:1000). To compare the level of surface expression, binding of 5-[3H]HT was measured in parallel. Amount of the phosphorylated and the total Erk1/2 were quantified by densitometric measurements using GelPro Analyser version 3.1 software. The surface expression of the wild-type and mutant receptors was adjusted to 450–500 fmol/mg of protein, as accessed by 5-[3H]HT binding. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100-fold excess of specific 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT. Expression and Palmitoylation of the 5-HT1A Receptor—A high titer baculovirus stock containing the cDNA of the murine 5-HT1A receptor tagged with an HA epitope at the N terminus was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and used for infection of Sf.9 insect cells. In order to monitor the expression and subcellular distribution of the receptor, infected Sf.9 cells were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 1A). The HA-tagged 5-HT1A receptors were specifically detected by anti-HA antibodies and localized mainly at the cell surface. Labeling with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE revealed a single protein band with a molecular mass of ∼46 kDa (Fig. 1B, left panel). This corresponds to the predicted molecular mass of the 5-HT1A receptor. The absence of specific bands in the immunoprecipitates from non-infected or baculovirus wild-type-infected Sf.9 cells confirmed that the 46-kDa band indeed represents the 5-HT1A receptor. To examine whether the 5-HT1A receptor is acylated, Sf.9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus were metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. Such labeling revealed a single band of 46 kDa (Fig. 1B, right panel) detectable only in cells infected with the recombinant virus. This result demonstrates that the 5-HT1A receptor efficiently incorporates [3H]palmitate. Having shown that the 5-HT1A receptor is acylated, we went on to analyze the chemical nature of the fatty acid bond in order to distinguish between amide-type and ester-type fatty acid linkages. As shown in Fig. 2A, the [3H]palmitate-derived radioactivity was sensitive to treatment with increasing concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol. Moreover, treatment of [3H]palmitate-labeled 5-HT1A receptors with neutral hydroxylamine resulted in a cleavage of the label from the receptor (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that the 5-HT1A receptor contains thioester-linked acyl groups and no fatty acids linked through amide or hydroxyester bonds. To determine the identity of receptor-bound fatty acids, the receptor was subjected to the fatty acid analysis. For that, fatty acids were hydrolyzed from the gel-purified protein and separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Analysis of the TLC data revealed that the 5-HT1A receptor contains only palmitate with no traces of myristic or stearic acid (Fig. 2C). Activation of the 5-HT1A Receptor Does Not Affect Receptor Palmitoylation—We have previously demonstrated that palmitoylation of the other member of the serotonin receptor family, the 5-HT4(a) receptor, is a dynamic process and that receptor stimulation by agonists increases the rate of palmitate turnover (36Ponimaskin E.G. Schmidt M.F. Heine M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 627-634Google Scholar). To test whether palmitoylation of the 5-HT1A receptor may also be regulated by the agonist, Sf.9 cells expressing the recombinant receptor were treated with increasing concentrations of 5-HT while labeling the cells with [3H]palmitate. The results shown in Fig. 3A demonstrate that stimulation with the agonist does not result in any dose-dependent changes of receptor palmitoylation. Labeling with [35S]methionine done in parallel demonstrated that the expression level of the receptor was not affected upon exposure to the agonist (Fig. 3A). In order to obtain detailed information about the dynamics of palmitoylation, we studied the time-course of agonist-induced incorporation of [3H]pa"
https://openalex.org/W2017695252,"The possible roles of a 14-kDa human thioredoxin (Trx)-related protein (TRP14) in TNF-α signaling were studied in comparison with those of Trx1 by RNA interferencein HeLa cells. Depletion of TRP14 augmented the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα as well as the consequent activation of NF-κB to a greater extent than did Trx1 depletion. Deficiency of TRP14 or Trx1 enhanced TNF-α-induced activation of caspases and subsequent apoptosis by a similar extent. The TNF-α-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), however, was promoted by depletion of TRP14 but not by that of Trx1. Unlike Trx1, TRP14 neither associated with nor inhibited the kinase activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1), an upstream activator of JNK and p38. In combination with the results in the accompanying paper that TRP14 did not reduce the known substrates of Trx1, these results suggest that TRP14 modulates TNF-α signaling pathways, provably by interacting with proteins distinct from the targets of Trx1. In an effort to identify target proteins of TRP14, a mutant of TRP14, in which the active site cysteine (Cys46) was substituted with serine, was shown to form a disulfide-linked complex with LC8 cytoplasmic dynein light chain. The complex was detected in HeLa cells treated with H2O2 or TNF-α but not in untreated cells, suggesting that LC8 cytoplasmic dynein light chain is a possible substrate of TRP14.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was one of the first receptor ligands shown to generate ROS in nonphagocytic cells and is among the ligands whose signaling pathways have been studied most in relation to ROS production (4Meier B.

The binding of TNF-α to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) generates both proapoptotic and prosurvival signals by inducing the formation of a multiprotein signaling complex at the cell membrane. This complex in turn triggers the caspase cascade, the activation of specific kinases such as the IκB kinase (IKK) complex and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and the transcription of various genes mediated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) (6Chen G.

In the accompanying study (26Jeong W. Yoon H.W. Lee S.-R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3142-3150Google Scholar), we identified and characterized a 14-kDa cytosolic protein, designated Trx-related protein 14 (TRP14). Here we studied the possible roles of TRP14 in TNF-α signaling in comparison with those of Trx1 by RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells. Partial depletion of TRP14 or Trx1 by RNAi resulted in enhancement of TNF-α-induced activation of caspases and NF-κB. The TNF-α-induced activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, however, was augmented by depletion of TRP14 but not by that of Trx1. Furthermore, unlike Trx1, reduced TRP14 neither bound to nor inhibited the activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a MAPKKK that activates JNK and p38 pathways. These results suggest that TNF-α signaling pathways are modulated differentially by TRP14 and Trx1 in response to changes in cellular redox state. It was previously shown that Trx substrates could be trapped using a mutant Trx, in which the C-terminal active site cysteine was substituted with serine (27Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Jacquot J.P. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19714-19722Google Scholar, 28Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Google Scholar). A similar procedure was applied here to identify LC8 cytoplasmic dynein light chain as a possible target of TRP14. Materials—Goat antibody to human Trx1 was obtained from American Diagnostica; mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and to LC8 were from BD Biosciences; rabbit antibodies to phosphorylated IκBα, to phosphorylated JNK, to phosphorylated p38 MAPK, to caspase-3, and to caspase-9 as well as a mAb to caspase-8 were from Cell Signaling Technology; rabbit antibodies to IκBα, to JNK1, and to Bid were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; a mAb to β-actin was from Abcam; rabbit antibodies to Mn2+-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) were from Upstate Biotechnology; and mAbs to the FLAG epitope and to the hemagglutinin epitope (HA) were from Sigma and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Agarose beads conjugated with anti-HA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The fluorogenic caspase substrates DEVD-AMC and LEHD-AMC were from BD Pharmingen and Biomol, respectively. The pcDNA3-ASK1-FLAG and GST-SEK1 (KR) were from H. Ichijo (Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University) and L. Zon (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School), respectively. Mammalian expression vectors, pCR-TRP14 and pHA-TRP14 were constructed by inserting human TRP14 cDNA into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) and the XbaI and BamHI sites of pCGN vector (W. Herr, Cold Spring Harbor laboratory), respectively. To express HA-tagged Trx1 in HeLa cells, pHA-Trx1 was constructed by cloning human Trx1 gene at the XbaI and BamHI sites of pCGN vector. For the production of GST-TRP14 protein, DNA sequence encoding TRP14 was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX4T1 vector. Vectors for expression of C-terminal cysteine mutant TRP14, pGST-TRP14-C46S and pHA-TRP14-C46S were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Quick-Change kit (Stratagene). To express FLAG-tagged LC8 in HeLa cells, pFLAG-LC8 was constructed by cloning the human LC8 gene at the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma). Immunoblot Analysis—Cellular total proteins (20 μg, unless indicated otherwise) were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h first with 5% dried nonfat milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then with primary antibodies in the same solution. After washing of the membrane with TBST, immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Depletion of TRP14 or Trx1 by RNAi—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target human TRP14 and human Trx1 mRNAs were based on nucleotides 104–122 and 256–276, respectively, relative to the translation start site. The siRNAs were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase (29Donze O. Picard D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e46Google Scholar) and introduced into HeLa cells as described (30Chang T.S. Jeong W. Choi S.Y. Yu S. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25370-25376Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were harvested by exposure to trypsin, diluted with fresh medium without antibiotics, and transferred to 6-well plates. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were transfected with the siRNAs for 2.5 days with the use of OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The Scramble II Duplex (Dharmacon) served as a negative control for siRNA activity. A mixture of 12 μl of OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen) and 3 μl of OligofectAMINE was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and was then combined with 10 μl of 20 μm siRNA diluted with 175 μl of OptiMEM. The resulting mixture (200 μl) was incubated for 20 min at room temperature to allow complex formation and then overlaid onto each well containing the cells for a final volume of 1.5 ml per well. Flow Cytometry—Cells (∼1 × 106) were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed overnight at 4 °C in 70% ethanol, resuspended in 400 μl of a solution containing propidium iodide (25 μg/ml), DNase-free RNase (10 μg/ml), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cell cycle analysis was then performed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). A total of 25,000 nuclei were analyzed for each sample, and the cell cycle distribution was quantified with WinMDI software. Immune Complex Kinase Assay—HeLa cells were subjected to transient transfection in 100-mm dishes with 4 μg of pcDNA3-ASK1-FLAG and 12 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, the cells were exposed to 1 mm H2O2 for 20 min, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed for 10 min at 4 °C in a solution containing 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and 25 nm microcystin. The lysates (1 mg of protein) were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 15 μl of Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) with constant rotation. The resulting immune complexes were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) before use as the source of ASK1. The phosphorylation of 1 μgofa GST-SEK1(KR) was performed for 30 min at 30 °C with immunoprecipitated ASK1-FLAG in a final volume of 40 μl containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of recombinant TRP14 or Trx1 pretreated with 1 mm DTT. The reaction mixture was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the radioactivity associated with the GST-SEK1(KR) band was quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. LC-MS/MS Analysis of Protein Digests—Protein bands stained with Coomassie Blue were excised, reduced, and alkylated, followed by trypsinization as previously described (31Ihling C. Berger K. Hofliger M.M. Fuhrer D. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Sinz A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 1240-1246Google Scholar). These digests were then analyzed on a Micromass QTOF Ultima Global (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in electrospray mode interfaced with an Agilent HP1100 CapLC (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) prior to the mass spectrometer. 5 μl of each digest was loaded onto a Vydec C18 MS column (100 × 0.15 mm; Grace Vydec, Hesperia, CA) and chromatographic separation was performed at 1 μl/min using the following gradient: 0–10% B over 5 min; gradient from 10–40% B over 60 min; 40–95% B over 5 min; 95% B held over 5 min (solvent A: 0.2% formic acid in water; solvent B: 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile). A data-dependent analysis (DDA) method collected CID data for the three most abundant multiply charged ions observed in the preceding survey scan (m/z 300–1990) above a threshold of 10 counts/sec. Data was processed using the Mass-Lynx (version 3.5) to generate peak list files before submitting them to Mascot search at www.matrixscience.com (MatrixScience Ltd., London, UK). Roles of TRP14 and Trx1 in TNF-α-induced NF-κB Activation—TNF-α is a potent stimulator of NF-κB activation. It has been shown that ROS generally augments the NF-κB activation (7Garg A.K.

Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Miranda M. Mari M. Ardite E. Morales A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G7-17Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of redox-regulatory molecules such as Trx suppresses it (22Takeuchi J. Hirota K. Itoh T. Shinkura R. Kitada K. Yodoi J. Namba T. Fukuda K. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 83-92Google Scholar, 23Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H. Takeuchi J. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Biol.

We therefore examined the effect of overexpression of TRP14 on TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in HeLa cells that had also been transfected with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene. Transient overexpression of TRP14 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the TNF-α-induced increase in reporter gene activity (Fig. 1A). The role of endogenous Trx1 in the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB was also previously examined by introducing Trx1-specific antisense oligonucleotides into HeLa cells. The substantial depletion of Trx1 induced by these oligonucleotides was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression, however (23Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H. Takeuchi J. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27891-27897Google Scholar). We applied RNAi to reduce the abundance of endogenous TRP14 or Trx1 in HeLa cells and then monitored expression of the endogenous MnSOD gene, which is induced in response to NF-κB activation (33Xu Y.

DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1127-1136Google Scholar, 35Wong G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 205-209Google Scholar). Two and half days after transfection of cells with the corresponding siRNA, the abundance of TRP14 and Trx1 was reduced by ∼70 and ∼90%, respectively, compared with the values for cells transfected with a control RNA (Fig. 1B). This partial depletion of TRP14 resulted in an increase in MnSOD expression of about 2-fold in unstimulated cells and of ∼1.7-fold in TNF-α-stimulated cells (Fig. 1B). The depletion of Trx1 also increased MnSOD expression by about 2-fold in unstimulated cells but only by ∼1.2-fold in TNF-α-stimulated cells (Fig. 1B). These results thus indicated that TRP14 is a more potent inhibitor of NF-κB activity than is Trx1 in HeLa cells. In response to activating signals such as TNF-α, the inhibitory protein IκB, which binds to NF-κB and sequesters it in the cytoplasm under resting conditions, is phosphorylated and subsequently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, thereby allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and to activate gene expression (6Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Google Scholar, 8Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar). Overexpression of Trx1 was previously shown to inhibit TNF-α-induced degradation of IκBα in HeLa cells (23Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H. Takeuchi J. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27891-27897Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of TRP14 or Trx1 depletion on the time course of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation (Fig. 1C). Transfection of cells with the TRP14 siRNA increased the rate and extent of serine phosphorylation of IκBα, compared with those apparent in cells transfected with control RNA, and these effects were accompanied by an increase in the rate of IκBα degradation. Transfection with the Trx1 siRNA also enhanced the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, but to a lesser degree than did that with the TRP14 siRNA. These results are thus consistent with those showing that TRP14 depletion had a greater effect on TNF-α-induced MnSOD expression than did Trx1 depletion. Roles of TRP14 and Trx1 in TNF-α-induced Apoptosis and Caspase Activation—Exposure of cells to TNF-α triggers the activation of a caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis (6Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Google Scholar, 7Garg A.K. Aggarwal B.B. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 509-517Google Scholar). However, TNF-α also activates two transcription factors, AP-1 and NF-κB, that induce the expression of genes that act to suppress TNF-α-induced apoptosis, explaining why the apoptotic response to TNF-α usually depends on inhibition of protein synthesis (36Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar). Although several studies have addressed the issue, the role of Trx1 in apoptosis induced by oxidants or other agents remains unclear (37Ma X. Karra S. Lindner D.J. Hu J. Reddy S.P. Kimchi A. Yodoi J. Kalvakolanu D.V. Kalvakolanu D.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3703-3715Google Scholar, 38Andoh T. Chock P.B. Chiueh C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9655-9660Google Scholar, 39Baker A. Santos B.D. Powis G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 78-81Google Scholar). We examined the effect of TRP14 or Trx1 depletion on TNF-α-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells in which protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide. Transfection of cells with TRP14 or Trx1 siRNAs increased the number of dead cells as revealed by phase-contrast microscopy both 4 and 8 h after exposure to TNF-α and cycloheximide (Fig. 2A). We also quantified apoptotic cells by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide. The number of apoptotic cells (those with a subdiploid (<2N) DNA content) at various times after exposure to TNF-α and cycloheximide was increased by a factor of 2–3 by partial depletion of TRP14 or Trx1 (Fig. 2, B and C). A critical event in TNF-α-induced apoptosis is the activation of caspase-8 (6Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Google Scholar, 40Sartorius U. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 20-29Google Scholar, 41Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Google Scholar). Active caspase-8 then cleaves other procaspases to initiate a caspase cascade (42Chang H.Y. Yang X. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 821-846Google Scholar) as well as cytosolic Bid to generate a truncated form of this protein; the latter translocates to mitochondria and induces the release of cytochrome c, which triggers the activation of caspase-9 (43Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Google Scholar). Both of these signaling pathways triggered by caspase-8 converge on caspase-3, the active form of which mediates the degradation of many apoptotic substrates including PARP (44Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Google Scholar). We examined the effect of TRP14 or Trx1 depletion on the time courses of the TNF-α-induced cleavage of procaspases-8, -9, and -3, Bid, and PARP by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3, A and B). Depletion of either TRP14 or Trx1 accelerated the cleavage of all five proteins. The cleavage of procaspase-8 and that of PARP, which correspond to the most upstream and downstream events, were affected least and most, respectively, by depletion of TRP14 or Trx1. The effects of TRP14 or Trx1 deficiency on caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation were confirmed by measurement of the corresponding protease activities with specific fluorogenic substrates (Fig. 3C). Roles of TRP14 and Trx1 in TNF-α-induced Activation of JNK and p38 MAPK—TNF-α also induces the activation of various MAPKs, most notably JNK and p38 (6Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Google Scholar, 36Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar, 45Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. Balsano C. Levrero M. Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Google Scholar, 46Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Trx1 was previously shown to inhibit the TNF-α-induced activation of JNK and p38 (19Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Google Scholar, 24Hashimoto S. Matsumoto K. Gon Y. Furuichi S. Maruoka S. Takeshita I. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Horie T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 443-447Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the TNF-α-induced activation of these MAPKs in HeLa cells was affected by transfection with TRP14 or Trx1 siRNAs. MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues (Thr183 and Tyr185 for JNK; Thr180 and Tyr182 for p38) within a TXY motif (47Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for the dually phosphorylated proteins revealed that, although the time courses of TNF-α-induced JNK and p38 phosphorylation in TRP14-deficient cells were similar to those in control cells, the extent of phosphorylation of both proteins was increased by a factor of ∼2 in the TRP14-deficient cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, the time course and extent of JNK and p38 phosphorylation were unaffected by Trx1 depletion. TRP14 Neither Associates with Nor Inhibits the Activity of ASK1—Reduced Trx1 binds to and inhibits the activity of ASK1, a MAPK kinase kinase that phosphorylates and activates MAPK kinases that in turn activate JNK and p38 by phosphorylating their TXY motifs (18Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Google Scholar, 19Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Google Scholar, 48Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H. Tobiume K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 415-425Google Scholar). To examine whether TRP14 also associates with ASK1, we transfected HeLa cells with expression vectors for FLAG-tagged ASK1 and either HA-tagged TRP14 or HA-tagged Trx1. Immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitates prepared from cell lysates with antibodies to HA revealed that ASK1-FLAG coprecipitated with HA-Trx1 but not with HA-TRP14 (Fig. 5A). We also examined the effects of TRP14 and Trx1 on the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated ASK1-FLAG with a GST-SEK1 fusion protein as substrate. SEK1 (also known as MKK4) is a MAPK kinase that is phosphorylated by ASK1. TRP14 at concentrations up to 6 μm did not affect the activity of ASK1-FLAG, whereas this activity was markedly inhibited by Trx1 at similar concentrations (Fig. 5B). Thus, unlike Trx1, TRP14 does not appear to interact with ASK1. LC8 Is a Possible Target Protein of TRP14 —During the reduction process of substrate, Trx forms a mixed disulfide intermediate with the substrate using its N-terminal cysteine of the CXXC motif (Cys32 in human Trx1). Given that the release of substrate from the disulfide-linked intermediate requires an attack of the disulfide by the C-terminal cysteine of the CXXC motif (Cys35 in human Trx1), the intermediate can be stabilized when Trx lacks the C-terminal Cys as seen previously with plant Trx (27Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Jacquot J.P. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19714-19722Google Scholar, 28Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Google Scholar). To identify possible target proteins of TRP14, we produced a GST-fusion protein (GST-TRP14-C46S) of mutant TRP14, in which the C-terminal CXXC motif cysteine (Cys46) was substituted with serine, and immobilized the fusion proteins on glutathione (GSH) resins. HeLa cell lysate that had been subjected to air oxidation was incubated with the resin to allow the formation of the mixed-disulfide intermediate. The proteins bound to the resin were eluted by incubation with a buffer containing 10 mm DTT and subjected to SDS-PAGE. A resin prepared using the GST fusion protein (GST-TRP14) of wild type TRP14 was used as a control. When protein bands eluted from the mutant resin were compared with those from the control resin, selective retention by the mutant resin of three proteins of 8, 13, and 20 kDa was apparent (Fig. 6A). Individual bands were identified by slicing out the protein bands, in gel trypsinization, followed by LC-MS/MS. As shown in Table I, the 8 kDa protein was identified as LC8 dynein light chain (LC8) also known as Dlc-1 (dyenin light chain 1) or PIN (protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase); the 20 kDa protein as cofilin; and the 13 kDa protein as ribosomal protein L30. Identity of the 8 and 20 kDa proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analyses with anti-LC8 and anti-cofilin antibodies, respectively (Fig. 6B).Table ILC-MS/MS of tryptic digests of three protein bandsBandsProtein identifiedm/z observedaIndicates the charge state of each m/z observed.

https://openalex.org/W2047561028,"Two mosquito STATs, AaSTAT and CtSTAT, have been cloned from Aedes albopictus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes, respectively. These two STATs are more similar to those of Drosophila, Anopheles, and mammalian STAT5 in the DNA binding and Src homology 2 domains. The mRNA transcripts are expressed at all developmental stages, and the proteins are present predominantly at the pupal and adult stages in both mosquitoes. Stimulation with lipopolysaccharide resulted in an increase of tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of AaSTAT and CtSTAT as well as an increase of luciferase activity of a reporter gene containing Drosophila STAT binding motif in mosquito C6/36 cells. After being infected with Japanese encephalitis virus, nuclear extracts of C6/36 cells revealed a decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of AaSTAT which could be restored by sodium orthovanadate treatment. Taking all of the data together, this is the first report to clone and characterize two mosquito STATs with 81% identity and to demonstrate a different response of tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of these two STATs by lipopolysaccharide treatment and by Japanese encephalitis virus infection.

Mosquitoes, like other insects, have efficient humoral and cellular defense system(s) that exhibit prominent similarity to the innate immunity in vertebrates (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Google Scholar, 2Elrod-Erickson M. Mishra S. Schneider D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 781-784Google Scholar). The innate immunity is the first line defense of insects and mammals to combat microbes. This ancestrally common defense system in Drosophila and mammals depends on conserved intracellular signaling pathways that can respond rapidly to infection by transcriptional regulation (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Google Scholar, 3Borregaard N. Elsbach P. Ganz T. Garred P. Svejgaard A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 68-70Google Scholar). Two distinct pathways are involved in the regulation of the secretions of antimicrobial peptides in the fat body. First is the Toll/Dif pathway, which is activated mainly by fungi and Gram-positive bacteria, and the second is the Imd/Rel pathway, which is activated mainly by Gramnegative bacteria. These two conserved pathways mediate differential expression of antimicrobial peptides via distinct nuclear factor-κB-like transcription factors (4Khush R.S. Leulier F. Lemaitre B. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 260-264Google Scholar, 5Lemaitre B. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14614-14619Google Scholar, 6Hultmark D. Curr. Opin.

Bach E.A. Perrimon N. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2598-2606Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that a complement-like humoral protein TEP1 was produced via JAK/STAT pathway in Drosophila after bacterial challenge (8Lagueux M. Perrodou E. Levashina E.A. Capovilla M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11427-11432Google Scholar). Moreover, the Anopheles STAT could translocate into nuclei of the fat body cells after bacterial challenge (9Barillas-Mury C. Han Y.-S. Seeley D. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 959-967Google Scholar). The activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and JAK/STAT pathways after LPS stimulation in addition to Toll/Dif and Imd/Rel pathways was also detected by a genomewide approach in Drosophila (10Boutros M. Agaisse H. Perrimon N. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 711-722Google Scholar). All data suggested that there is a tight connection among the pathways of Toll/Dif, Imd/Rel, and JAK/STAT in the innate immune responses in the insect. In this scenario, the JAK/STAT pathway is most likely to be activated to produce complement-like humoral factors after the activation of the Toll/Dif or Imd/Rel pathway for secretion of antimicrobial peptides to accelerate bacterial clearance. However, the molecular mechanism linking these two pathways remains to be characterized.

In mammals, the interferon (IFN) signaling through JAK/STAT is an essential pathway to defense viral infection (11Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Google Scholar, 12Shtrichman R. Samuel C.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 251-259Google Scholar). The well known IFN signaling pathway begins with the binding of IFN-α/β or IFN-γ to its cognate receptors on the surface of cells, followed by the activation of JAK/STAT and the translocation of activated STAT dimer to the nucleus for binding to interferon-stimulated response element or γ-interferon-activated sites on target genes and activates the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes that encode proteins with potent antiviral, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory effect (13Lau J.F. Horvath C.M. Mt. Sinai J. Med. 2002; 69: 156-168Google Scholar, 14Sen G.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Google Scholar, 15Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Google Scholar). Although these IFN immune responses through the JAK/STAT pathway to combat viral infection are evolutionally conserved in mammals, there is no evidence to support whether equivalent homologs of IFN signal transduction pathways are present in mosquitoes to combat virus. Mosquitoes can transmit a variety of arboviruses that cause different diseases in mammals (16Bres P. Monath, T.P. The Arboviruses: Epidemiology and Ecology. Vol. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: 1-17Google Scholar). Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles mosquitoes are known to transmit flaviviruses such as Dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which cause severe diseases in human (17Burke D.S. Monath T.P. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Vol. 1. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1043-1126Google Scholar). For their survival, arboviruses must have developed strategies to replicate in both vertebrate and invertebrate to avoid the efficient immunity produced by these two different hosts (18Diamond M.S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2003; 81: 196-206Google Scholar), although mosquito does not have adaptive immunity. We are interested in the regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway in the immune reactions of these two mosquitoes in response to LPS stimulation and JEV infection. To our knowledge, this study is the first time AaSTAT and CtSTAT have been cloned from these two mosquitoes. We investigated the different response in the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of these two mosquito STATs by LPS treatment in vivo and by JEV infection in C6/36 cells. AaSTAT and CtSTAT Genes Were Isolated from A. albopictus and C. tritaeniorhynchus Mosquitoes, Respectively—Total RNAs were isolated from the larvae of A. albopictus (Chungho strain) and C. tritaeniorhynchus (Peitou strain) using the RNAzol reagent (Tel-Test) following the instructions of the manufacturer. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 50–100 μg of total RNA using 10 pmol of oligo(T) primer and random hexamer in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 30 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), 2 mm dNTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 300 units of reverse transcriptase superscript II (Invitrogen). Incubation was performed at 42 °C for 1 h. Two degenerate primers, ST5F (5′-AA(A/G)CA(A/G)CCNCCNCA(A/G)GTNATNAA-3′) and ST5R (5′-GC(A/G)(A/T)ANAAGCA(T/C) TCCCA(A/G)AANGT-3′) were designed based on the sequence of two well conserved regions, KQPPQV(M/I)K and TFWEW(F/L)(F/T)A (these regions are indicated by underlines in Fig. 1) in most mammalian and insect STAT proteins (19Yan R.

With these two primers and first strand cDNAs of the two mosquitoes, PCR was performed to isolate STAT homologs cDNA fragment. The resulting PCR product of 700 bp was cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced.Fig. 1Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of AaSTAT and CtSTAT with those from AgSTAT, DmSTAT, and human STAT5a.

According to the sequences obtained from 5′- and 3′-RACE, primers H3-A5-F (5′-GAAGCTTATGTCGCTGTGGGCACGC-3′) containing a HindIII site and A3-R-Kpn (5′-TGGTACCGATCCCATTCGCCATCGGTG-3′) containing a KpnI site were used to amplify the open reading frame of AaSTAT. Similarly, primers H3-C5-F (5′-TAAGCTTATGTCCCTGTGGGCCCGC-3′) containing a Hin-dIII site and C3-R-Kpn (5′-TGGTACCATGCCCGTTGACCACGGTTG-3′) containing a KpnI site were used to amplify the open reading frame of CtSTAT. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector, and their complete sequences were determined by DNA sequencing. DNA Sequence Analysis and Phylogenetic Analysis—All clones including full-length clone were sequenced using PRISM Ready Reaction dye deoxy termination cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems 310 automated DNA sequencer. Sequence assembly and alignments were performed using the Genetics Computer Group software program. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the sequences of the DNA binding domain, linker region, and SH2 domain from STATs of human, Anopheles, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis were performed using ClustalX program (21Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Google Scholar, 22Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNAs were isolated from C6/36 cells (mosquito cell line of A. albopictus), embryos, larvae, pupae, adult males, and adult females of A. albopictus and C. tritaeniorhynchus using the RNAzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA from tissue of each developmental stage was synthesized from 50–100 μg of total RNA using 10 pmol of oligo(T) primer and random hexamers in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 30 units of RNasin, 2 mm dNTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 300 units of reverse transcriptase superscript II. Incubation was performed at 42 °C for 1 h, and 1–2 μl of the resulting reaction containing the single-stranded cDNA template was used for subsequent PCR amplification. The PCRs were performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 25 ng of the specific actin primers from A. albopictus (a-actin-F, 5′-TCGCCATCCAGGCTGTCCTG-3′; and a-actin-R, 5′-GAGTTGTAGACGGTTTCGTGG-3′) or AaSTAT-specific primers (a-3F5, 5′-CCAGACCACCGGTGGAACGAC-3′; and a-3end, 5′-CCTCTCTACCGTCCCGATTAGATCC-3′, corresponding to sequences in the activation domain and 3′-untranslated region, respectively). Other PCRs were also performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture with the specific actin primers from C. tritaeniorhynchus (c-actin-F, 5′-TCGCTATCCAGGCTGTGCTG-3′; and c-actin-R, 5′-GAGTTGAACACGGTCTCGTGG-3′) or CtSTAT-specific primers (c-3F3, 5′-CAGATCCTGCACATCCAGCCGTTCACG-3′; and c-3end, 5′-ACAGTTCGCACCAAAACATGAGTACAC-3′, corresponding to sequences in the SH2 domain and 3′-untranslated region respectively), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 0.5 unit of ExTaq (Takara Shuzo, Shiga, Japan). The conditions for amplification were denaturation at 96 °C for 2 min, then 35 cycles of 96 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. A negative control was performed in the absence of RNA. The products were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis—Gene expression of AaSTAT was also determined by quantitative real time PCR analysis on the DNA Engine Opticon® 2 System (MJ Research Inc., Reno, NV) with FastStart DNA master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (23Konnai S. Usui T. Ohashi K. Onuma M. Vet. Microbiol. 2003; 94: 283-294Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 6 μl of template cDNA, 2 μl of 10× SYBR Green Master Mix, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 100 nm primers (a-3end, a-3F5, and a-actin-F, a-actin-R for AaSTAT gene and actin gene, respectively) at a final volume of 20 μl. The reactions were denatured at 95 °C for 10 min and cycled 50 times under the following parameters: 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s. At the end of the PCR, the temperature was increased from 65 to 95 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min, and the fluorescence was measured every 15 s to construct the melting curve. A nontemplate control was run with every assay, and all determinations were performed at least in duplicate to achieve reproducibility. The actin gene of A. albopictus was used as reference. The threshold cycles (CT) were recorded for all samples for both the AaSTAT gene and the reference. The relative gene copy number was evaluated from the CT of the AaSTAT gene and the reference gene. By subtracting the CT of the reference gene from the CT of the AaSTAT gene, the ΔCT value for the AaSTAT gene was determined. Plasmid Construction—The expression vector, pAaSTAT-HA and pCtSTAT-HA were constructed by inserting the open reading frame of AaSTAT and CtSTAT before a HA tag and between the Hind III and KpnI sites of pHA-YUN, which is derived from pcDNA3. The pHA-YUN plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. H. J. Kung (University of California at Davis Cancer Center, Sacramento). The cJH1 domain of C. tritaeniorhynchus JAK (235 amino acids, position 940–1175) (GenBank accession number AY278117) was generated by PCR with primers containing EcoRV and NotI restriction sites on both ends and cloned into the C terminus of pAaSTAT-HA and pCtSTAT-HA to generate pAaSTAT-HA-cJH1 and pCtSTAT-HA-cJH1, respectively. The resulting clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The reporter plasmid 2XDrafSTATwt was kindly given by Dr. M. Yamaguchi (Laboratory of Cell Biology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan). This reporter plasmid contains the Drosophila raf gene promoter with two recognition consensus sequences (TTCGCGGAA) for Drosophila STAT and a luciferase reporter gene (24Kwon E.J. Park H.S. Kim Y.S. Oh E.J. Nishida Y. Matsukage A. Yoo M.A. Yamaguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19824-19830Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription and Translation—The TNT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) was used to synthesize AaSTAT-HA, CtSTAT-HA, AaSTAT-HA-cJH1, and CtSTAT-HA-cJH1 proteins in vitro according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 0.2–1 μg of DNA plasmids and 1–20 μCi of [35S]methionine were added to the master mixture and incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. The synthesized proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. For subsequent bandshift analysis and Western blotting, [35S]methionine was replaced by cold methionine (final concentration, 1 mm). Cell Cultures—Mosquito C6/36 cells (25Singh K.R. Paul S.D. Indian J. Med. Res. 1968; 56: 815-820Google Scholar, 26Igarashi A. J. Gen. Virol. 1978; 40: 531-544Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 28 °C. All the culture regents were purchased from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). To infect with JEV, an ∼80% confluent monolayer of C6/36 cells grown in 10-mm dish was first absorbed with JEV at multiplicity of infection 0.2 for 1 h at 28 °C. After adsorption the unbound viruses were removed by gentle washing with serum-free culture medium, and fresh medium containing 2% fetal calf serum was added to the dish for further incubation at 28 °C. Alternatively, after infection with JEV for 1 day, C6/36 cells were treated with 50 μm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) and harvested on day 3 postinfection. Virus and Virus Infection—JEV strain NT113, isolated from mosquitoes in Taiwan in 1985 (27Jan L.R. Yueh Y.Y. Wu Y.C. Horng C.B. Wang G.R. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2000; 62: 446-452Google Scholar), was inoculated onto a confluent monolayer of C6/36 cells in RPMI medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained for 5 days at 28 °C, and then supernatant fluids were harvested and stored at –70 °C. This virus titer was 1 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml as determined by plaque assay on BHK21 cells. This virus stock, from the Institute of Preventive Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, was used to inoculate C6/36 cells for infection assay. Mosquitoes—The colonized mosquitoes used in the study were A. albopictus (Skuse) (Chungho strain) and C. tritaeniorhynchus Giles (Peitou strain), which were maintained on 10% sucrose solution in a humidified (80%) insectary at 26–28 °C with 14/10-h light/dark cycles. Larvae were reared in water pans and fed on commercial Tetramin fish food and yeast powder. These mosquitoes were kindly provided by S. Hung (Center for Disease Control, Department of Health, Taipei, Taiwan). Between 5 and 7 days after emergence mosquitoes were inoculated intrathoracically (28Imler J.L. Tauszig S. Jouanguy E. Forestier C. Hoffmann J.A. J. Endotoxin Res. 2000; 6: 459-462Google Scholar, 29Gubler D.J. Rosen L. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1976; 25: 146-150Google Scholar) with LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0127:B8; Sigma). The injection volume was 98 nl containing 9.8 ng of LPS. Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates and Nuclear Extracts—Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (30Sung S.C. Fan T.J. Chou C.M. Leu J.H. Hsu Y.L. Chen S.T. Hsieh Y.C. Huang C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 239-252Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.2 mm Na3VO4 and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The mosquito embryos, larvae, pupae, and adults were also homogenized with the same lysis buffer. Extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and the resulting supernatants were used for subsequent Western blotting. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedures described previously (31Ariyoshi K. Nosaka T. Yamada K. Onishi M. Oka Y. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24407-24413Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 20 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin, pH 7.9) on ice for 30 min and then vortexed vigorously and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 min. The supernatant was the cytoplasmic part at this stage. The pellets were then extracted with buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 350 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin, pH 7.9), rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. The extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and these supernatants, nuclear extracts, were quickly frozen and stored at –70 °C for subsequent use by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) or Western blotting. The extracts of adult female mosquitoes for EMSA were carried out by submerging the mosquitoes in liquid nitrogen for 5 min and then homogenized in buffer A. All the protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Antibodies and Western Blotting—Monoclonal Abs against HA tag and phosphotyrosine (pY99) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal Ab against α-tubulin was purchased from Sigma and Oncogen™ (CN Biosciences, Inc., Darmstadt, Germany). Rabbit polyclonal antisera specifically recognizing AaSTAT and CtSTAT were generated using a His-tagged AaSTAT or CtSTAT fusion protein as antigen. The His-tagged AaSTAT and CtSTAT fusion proteins were generated by PCR amplification of the DNA fragment encoding the C-terminal end of AaSTAT and CtSTAT (amino acid residues 722–907 and 736–880, respectively), followed by cloning of the PCR products into the His tag expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). These His-tagged AaSTAT and CtSTAT fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) under denaturing condition (1.5% sarcosine in phosphate-buffered saline) as described previously (32Chang M.S. Chang G.D. Leu J.H. Huang F.L. Chou C.K. Huang C.J. Lo T.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 827-844Google Scholar). The purified proteins were used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits by the intrasplenic immunization method (33Hong T.H. Chen S.T. Tang T.K. Wang S.C. Chang T.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 120: 151-157Google Scholar). The polyclonal Abs were harvested according to a method described previously (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-137Google Scholar). The in vitro transcription and translation products, extracts of cells or mosquitoes, were separated on 10% or 7% SDS-PAGE, then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 3% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline. The membrane was incubated with indicated Abs, and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EMSA—EMSA was performed as described previously (35Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were performed by the addition of nuclear extracts, adult mosquito extracts, or products of in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (10,000 cpm/μg) to the binding buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ZnCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a 20-μl reaction volume. An excess of unlabeled or mutant oligonucleotides was added as competitor as indicated. 1 μl of antiserum (1:2 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline) was also added as indicated. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the reaction mixture was loaded on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE and run at 200 V for 2 h at room temperature. The oligonucleotides probes used in this study were commercially available, corresponding to the DNA binding motifs for mammalian STATs (Santa Cruz). The sequences of upper strand of the normal and the corresponding mutant oligonucleotides are listed in Table 3 of Ref. 30Sung S.C. Fan T.J. Chou C.M. Leu J.H. Hsu Y.L. Chen S.T. Hsieh Y.C. Huang C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 239-252Google Scholar. The probes were prepared by annealing the upper and lower strands of oligonucleotides, one of which was end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Transactivation Assay—The plasmids used for transfections were purified by Qiagen plasmid purification kit (Qiagen). For transactivation assay, plasmid transfections were conducted by using the CELL-FECTIN kit (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates. For investigation of the endogenous AaSTAT activation by LPS, approximately 80% confluent C6/36 cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of 2XDrafSTATwt for 24 h; subsequently 10 μg/ml LPS was added into the culture medium. After stimulation with LPS for 30, 60, and 90 min, cells were harvested and extracted for luciferase activity assay. 2XDrafSTATwt contains the raf gene promoter of Drosophila with two recognition consensus sequences for Drosophila STAT and a luciferase gene (24Kwon E.J. Park H.S. Kim Y.S. Oh E.J. Nishida Y. Matsukage A. Yoo M.A. Yamaguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19824-19830Google Scholar). The C6/36 cells were harvested at 24.5, 25, and 25.5 h post-transfection and assayed for luciferase activity using luciferase assay kit Firelite according to the manufacturer's instructions (Packard). Final luciferase activity was obtained after normalizing protein concentration of each sample. Isolation and Characterization of AaSTAT and CtSTAT Genes—Two STAT homologs were isolated from mosquitoes A. albopictus and C. tritaeniorhynchus by RT-PCR amplification using degenerate primers containing sequences corresponding to two stretches of amino acid residues, KQPPQV(M/I)K and TFWEW(F/L)(F/T)A, which are highly conserved between mammalian and insect STATs (underlines in Fig. 1). The first strand cDNA from larvae of these two mosquitoes was used as template. Only one PCR product of 700 bp was obtained, the sequences from which were used to design the primers A5F1, A3F1, C5F1, and C3F1 for further 5′- and 3′-RACE to obtain full-length cDNA of the AaSTAT and CtSTAT. The full-length AaSTAT cDNA encompasses 3579 bp including a 2724-bp coding region, which encodes a protein of 907 amino acid residues, as well as a 524-bp 5′-untranslated region and 331-bp 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). The full-length CtSTAT cDNA consists of 4014 bp including a 2643-bp coding region, which encodes a protein of 880 amino acid residues, plus 843 bp upstream and 528 bp downstream of the open reading frame. These two sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers AY299686 and AY299687, respectively. The overall organization and the deduced amino acid residues of these two mosquito STATs compared with known STATs of Anopheles, Drosophila, and human"
https://openalex.org/W2086224809,"Translation initiation is poised between global regulation of cell growth and specific regulation of cell division. The mRNA cap-binding protein (eIF4E) is a critical integrator of cell growth and division because it is rate-limiting for translation initiation and is also rate-limiting for G1 progression. Translation initiation factor eIF4E is also oncogenic and a candidate target of c-myc. Recently, an activated inhibitory 4E-binding protein (4EBP) that blocks eIF4E was used to study its regulation of Drosophila growth. We adopted this approach in mammalian cells after identifying an autosensing mechanism that protects against increased levels of 4EBP1. Increased 4EBP1 induced a quantitative increase in the inactivated phosphorylated form of 4EBP1 in vitro and in vivo. To overcome this protective mechanism, we introduced alanine substitutions at four phosphorylation/inactivation sites in 4EBP1 to constitutively activate a 4EBPμ to block eIF4E. Overexpression of activated 4EBPμ inhibited cell proliferation and completely blocked transformation by both eIF4E and c-myc, although it did not block all tested oncogenes. Surprisingly, expression of the activated 4EBPμ increased cell size and protein content. Activated 4EBPμ blocked both cell proliferation and c-myc transformation by inhibiting G1 progression and increasing apoptosis, without decreasing protein synthesis. Our results identify mammalian eIF4E as rate-limiting for cell cycle progression before it regulates cell growth. It further identifies G1 control by translation initiation factors as an essential genetic target of c-myc that is necessary for its ability to transform cells. Translation initiation is poised between global regulation of cell growth and specific regulation of cell division. The mRNA cap-binding protein (eIF4E) is a critical integrator of cell growth and division because it is rate-limiting for translation initiation and is also rate-limiting for G1 progression.

Our results identify mammalian eIF4E as rate-limiting for cell cycle progression before it regulates cell growth. It further identifies G1 control by translation initiation factors as an essential genetic target of c-myc that is necessary for its ability to transform cells. Cell proliferation is the product of cell growth, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and terminal differentiation (1Conlon I. Raff M. Cell. 1999; 96: 235-244Google Scholar). Whereas cell division requires cell growth (2Polymenis M. Schmidt E.V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 76-80Google Scholar, 3Neufeld T.P. Edgar B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 784-790Google Scholar), mechanisms by which cell growth or growth regulators might control cell division remain less clear. The process of translation initiation can integrate cell growth and division because it is both rate-limiting for the first step in protein synthesis and has specific effects on cell cycle regulation (4Hanic-Joyce P.J. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 172: 134-145Google Scholar, 5Polymenis M. Schmidt E.V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2522-2531Google Scholar). Translation initiation factor eIF4E, which binds the m7GpppN mRNA cap structure, is the central molecule in translation initiation because it is the least abundant factor regulating translation in mammalian cells (6Duncan R. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5486-5492Google Scholar). Moreover, eIF4E is a key step in translation initiation because it induces malignant transformation when overexpressed in mammalian cells (7Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Google Scholar). Genetic models of eIF4E function illustrate its importance in both growth and cell division. Mutations in translation initiation factor eIF4E in budding yeast (cdc33) cause both a G1 arrest phenotype (8Brenner C. Nakayama N. Goebl M. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3556-3559Google Scholar) and limit protein synthesis (9Altmann M. Trachsel H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5923-5931Google Scholar). Unlike yeast, however, loss of Drosophila eIF4E limits growth with only downstream effects on cell cycle progression (10Lachance P.E. Miron M. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Lasko P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1656-1663Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of eIF4E produces no discernible phenotype in Drosophila (10Lachance P.E. Miron M. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Lasko P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1656-1663Google Scholar, 11Zhang H. Stallock J.P. Ng J.C. Reinhard C. Neufeld T.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2712-2724Google Scholar). Studies of mammalian eIF4E have been largely confined to cell culture systems. Studies using HeLa cells showed that DNA synthesis was altered in response to both overexpression and antisense inhibition of eIF4E (12De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Google Scholar, 13De Benedetti A. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5435-5445Google Scholar) but did not simultaneously assess effects on cell growth. These results, together with its transforming functions, strongly suggest that limiting amounts of eIF4E likely affect mammalian cell division before regulating cell growth (7Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Google Scholar). The c-myc oncogene is a paradigm for a gene that exerts profound effects on both cell growth and cell division (14Oster S.K. Ho C.S. Soucie E.L. Penn L.Z. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 81-154Google Scholar). Nevertheless, which of its many functions is essential to the role for myc in human cancer remains a critical question. A remarkably diverse set of myc target genes has emerged (15Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2023-2030Google Scholar). Broadly, c-myc targets genes that regulate cell cycle progression and genes that regulate cell growth (14Oster S.K. Ho C.S. Soucie E.L. Penn L.Z. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 81-154Google Scholar). Growth functions of c-myc were first identified in cells overexpressing c-myc and confirmed in c-myc null cells (16Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Google Scholar, 17Schmidt E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2988-2996Google Scholar). Increased protein synthesis precedes S phase entry after activation of chimeric proteins that fuse c-myc with the estradiol receptor (17Schmidt E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2988-2996Google Scholar, 18Rosenwald I.B. Rhoads D.B. Callanan L.D. Isselbacher K.J. Schmidt E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6175-6178Google Scholar). c-myc-induced proliferation correlates with an increase in protein synthesis in the B cells of transgenic mice overexpressing c-myc (19Iritani B.M. Eisenman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13180-13185Google Scholar). Delayed cell division rates in c-myc null fibroblasts match their decreased protein synthesis rates (20Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of dMyc first confirmed that its primary function in Drosophila is growth regulation (21Johnston L.A. Prober D.A. Edgar B.A. Eisenman R.N. Gallant P. Cell. 1999; 98: 779-790Google Scholar, 22Zaffran S. Chartier A. Gallant P. Astier M. Arquier N. Doherty D. Gratecos D. Semeriva M. Development. 1998; 125: 3571-3584Google Scholar, 23Gallant P. Shiio Y. Cheng P.F. Parkhurst S.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1996; 274: 1523-1527Google Scholar). These genetic studies seemed poised to simplify our understanding of the proto-oncogenic functions of myc until an interesting discrepancy between fly myc and mammalian myc emerged. Although Drosophila genetics placed dMyc in a group of cell growth regulators, mouse genetics proved c-myc to primarily regulate cell division (24Trumpp A. Refaeli Y. Oskarsson T. Gasser S. Murphy M. Martin G.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 2001; 414: 768-773Google Scholar). We are therefore particularly interested in evaluating both the cell division control and cell growth control functions of eIF4E as candidate mediators of the effects of myc (17Schmidt E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2988-2996Google Scholar). Our identification of the mRNA cap-binding protein (translation initiation factor 4E, eIF4E) as a candidate myc target gene first led us to propose that one of the primary functions of myc might be to regulate cell growth (18Rosenwald I.B. Rhoads D.B. Callanan L.D. Isselbacher K.J. Schmidt E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6175-6178Google Scholar). The presence of an essential myc-binding site in the eIF4E promoter demonstrated a potentially direct role for c-myc as an activator of eIF4E transcription (25Jones R.M. Branda J. Johnston K.A. Polymenis M. Gadd M. Rustgi A. Callanan L. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4754-4764Google Scholar). Recent differential expression screens have identified both additional translation initiation factors and ribosomal proteins as candidate c-myc target genes (26Coller H.A. Grandori C. Tamayo P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 397-406Google Scholar). The lack of apparent correlation between myc-induced genes, genes down-regulated in c-myc null cells, and genes required for transformation by c-myc remains puzzling (31Bush A. Mateyak M. Dugan K. Obaya A. Adachi S. Sedivy J. Cole M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3797-3802Google Scholar). For example, carbonyl-phosphate synthetase-aspartate transcarbamylase-dihydro-orotase gene expression clearly responds to loss of c-myc, but carbonyl-phosphate synthetase-aspartate transcarbamylase-dihydro-orotase apparently plays little role in tumors induced by c-myc (32Mac S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 27: 84-96Google Scholar). Recently, down-regulation of the expression of the H-ferritin gene was shown to be required for cell transformation by c-myc (33Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Google Scholar). Two additional myc targets are also critical to its transforming functions, PRDX3 and JPO1 (34Wonsey D.R. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6649-6654Google Scholar, 35Prescott J.E. Osthus R.C. Lee L.A. Lewis B.C. Shim H. Barrett J.F. Guo Q. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48276-48284Google Scholar). We therefore sought to develop a reagent that could determine whether increased function of translation initiation factor eIF4E was essential for transformation by c-myc. A family of proteins that binds to eIF4E (4EBP) 1The abbreviations used are: 4EBP4E-binding proteinPHASphosphorylated heat and acid-stableFCSfetal calf serumFBSfetal bovine serumHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleODCornithine decarboxylaseTORtarget of rapamycinTOPterminal oligopyrimidinemTORmammalian target of rapamycinFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorter. and inhibits its function was initially described as phosphorylated heat and acid-stable (PHAS) targets of insulin regulation (36Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Google Scholar). These inhibitors of eIF4E provide an alternative approach to study eIF4E function. Although loss of 4EBP1 should reveal unrestrained eIF4E functions, 4EBP1 null mice exhibit minimal, organ-specific defects in cell growth and division (37Blackshear P.J. Stumpo D.J. Carballo E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31510-31514Google Scholar, 38Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Poulin F. Kohara M. DeMaria C.T. Cheng A. Wu Z. Gingras A.C. Katsume A. Elchebly M. Spiegelman B.M. Harper M.E. Tremblay M.L. Sonenberg N. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1128-1132Google Scholar), and 4EBP null Drosophila are immunodeficient (39Bernal A. Kimbrell D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6019-6024Google Scholar). Surprisingly, overexpression of 4EBP1 in tissue culture only partially reverts tumorigenesis by eIF4E (40Rousseau D. Gingras A.C. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2415-2420Google Scholar). Recently, a more potent dominant activated translational inhibitor 4EBP was developed by mutating the d4EBP eIF4E-binding site to match the mammalian consensus sequence in Drosophila (41Miron M. Verdu J. Lachance P.E. Birnbaum M.J. Lasko P.F. Sonenberg N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 596-601Google Scholar). The major 4EBP (4EBP1) is inactivated by phosphorylation of four critical target sites that are targets of akt, TOR, and cdc2 (41Miron M. Verdu J. Lachance P.E. Birnbaum M.J. Lasko P.F. Sonenberg N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 596-601Google Scholar, 42Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Google Scholar, 43Heesom K.J. Gampel A. Mellor H. Denton R.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1374-1379Google Scholar). In this report we show that phosphorylation of these sites increases in response to attempts to overexpress 4EBP in vitro and in vivo. As a consequence of this finding, we developed a constitutively active 4EBPμ by mutating the four 4EBP inactivation/phosphorylation targets to alanines. We expressed this constitutively active form of 4EBP1 (4EBPμ) in model mammalian cells to evaluate the importance of the proposed connection between c-myc and eIF4E. We first used diploid rat embryo fibroblasts (TGR) to better understand the role of eIF4E as a mediator of cell growth and division (44Prouty S.M. Hanson K.D. Boyle A.L. Brown J.R. Shichiri M. Follansbee M.R. Kang W. Sedivy J.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 899-907Google Scholar). Because translation initiation factor eIF4E is a particularly interesting c-myc target gene, we then examined the effects of the 4EBPμ on rat fibroblasts (Rat1a) that can be transformed by myc and eIF4E in a single step (45Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Google Scholar, 46Stone J. de Lange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits E. Bishop J.M. Varmus H. Lee W. Mol. Cell.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 17.1-17.44Google Scholar). RNA Synthesis and in Vitro Translation—p4EBP5′UTR-4EBP was linearized and used as a template to synthesize capped mRNA in vitro using a kit from Ambion. T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used to synthesize 4EBP mRNA in vitro. 0.2 μg of RNA was used in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation reaction. Purified 4EBP1 proteins were incubated with the lysates for 10 min at room temperature prior to RNA template addition. 5 μl of the translation products were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Cell Transfection, Selection, and Cell Growth Assay—Rat1a cells were from Dr. Chi Dang at The Johns Hopkins University. TGR cells were from Dr. John Sedivy at Brown University (44Prouty S.M. Hanson K.D. Boyle A.L. Brown J.R. Shichiri M. Follansbee M.R. Kang W. Sedivy J.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 899-907Google Scholar). Both cell types were initially transfected with pMV7, pMVHA4EBP, pMV4EBPμ, and pMV4EBPμμ, respectively, together with either pCEP4 or pCEPeIF4E using Lipofectin reagents (Invitrogen). Rat1a cells were then transfected with pMV7, pMVHA4EBP, pMV4EBPμ, and pMV4EBPμμ, respectively, together with pCEP4 or pCEPmyc. Colonies selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml geneticin and 200 μg/ml hygromycin were stained and photographed to assess effects of constructs on cell survival. Individual colonies were initially isolated using trypsin-impregnated cloning filters. Because all colonies expressed the transfected proteins due to the double selection applied to all transfections, pooled transfectants were used in all subsequent studies. Proliferation curves were determined by counting viable cells harvested from triplicate 10-cm plates over a 4-day period (before confluence). All cell counts are presented together with least square trend lines. Soft agar cloning was performed as described (46Stone J. de Lange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits E. Bishop J.M. Varmus H. Lee W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1697-1709Google Scholar). Subconfluent Rat1a and TGR cells were labeled with 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine cell-labeling reagent (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min and harvested for cell cycle analysis. Cells were fixed in 80% ethanol for at least 1 h, incubated in anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody (BD Biosciences) for 30 min, and exposed to anti-mouse fluorescein secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. Cells were resuspended in propidium iodide (70 μg/ml) supplemented with RNase A (25 μg/ml) and analyzed. DNA content was measured using a FACScan cytometer (BD Biosciences). Apoptosis scored by quantifying sub-genomic fragmented DNA was confirmed by staining cells with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Roche Applied Science). Rat1a and NIH3T3 Transformation Assays—Clonogenicity of the Rat1a transfectants in soft agar was performed as described (46Stone J. de Lange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits E. Bishop J.M. Varmus H. Lee W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1697-1709Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with 1.5 μg of pMV7, pMVeIF4E, pDOL-erbB2, or pSV40T antigen together with an additional 1.5 μg of pMV7, pMVHA4EBP, pMV4EBPμ, or pMV4EBPμμ using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Transformed foci were identified using 1% methylene blue staining 3–4 weeks after plating. Mean ± S.D. of transformed foci per plate were evaluated using six 60-mm plates per assay condition. Immunoblots and Protein Synthesis Analysis—For Western analyses, cells were lysed in Laemmli loading buffer. 10 μg of protein sample was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were hybridized with anti-actin (N-350; Roche Applied Science), a mouse anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Roche Applied Science), or rabbit anti-4EBP1 antibodies (gift from Dr. John Lawrence) as indicated and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) as indicated in the figures. Protein content per cell was determined by lysis of a known number of cells in ELB lysis buffer. Measurement of the protein content of an aliquot of these lysates was performed by using a kit from Bio-Rad. Protein synthesis rates were determined by adding 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to each plate for 1–3 h as indicated. The labeled cells were lysed, and incorporated counts were determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described previously (13De Benedetti A. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5435-5445Google Scholar). 35S incorporated at the indicated time points was plotted, and a least squares trend line is shown. Polysomal Profile Analysis and RNA Blots—One 100-mm diameter plate containing the indicated cells was harvested for each polysomal analysis. Confluent cells were harvested and lysed in 300 μl of RSB (10 nm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 15 mm MgCl2) containing 100 μg/ml heparin, 1.2% Triton X-100, and 0.12% deoxycholate (50Meyuhas O. Blierman Y. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Amaldi F. Krieg P. A Laboratory Guide to RNA: Isolation, Analysis and Synthesis. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 65-81Google Scholar, 51Tang H. Hornstein E. Stolovich M. Levy G. Livingstone M. Templeton D. Avruch J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8671-8683Google Scholar). Nuclei were pelleted for 3 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The 300-μl extract was layered over 11.5 ml of a 15–45% (w/w) sucrose gradient with a 0.5-ml cushion of 45% sucrose. The gradients were centrifuged at 37,000 rpm for 2.5 h in an SW41 (Beckman) rotor at 4 °C. After centrifugation the A260 was continuously monitored and recorded across the gradient. The gradients were divided into polysomal (containing disomes and greater) and monosomal fractions (containing monosomes, ribosomal subunits, and mRNA ribonucleoproteins). For RNA blots of the polysomal and subpolysomal fractions, RNA was extracted from the polysomal and sub-polysomal fractions using Trizol reagent, and 50% of the harvested RNA was analyzed using standard RNA blotting techniques (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 17.1-17.44Google Scholar). Ribosomal Protein Synthesis and Immunoprecipitation Analysis of Ornithine Decarboxylase Synthesis—Cell fractionation for preparation of ribosomes was performed as described by Greco and Madjar (52Greco A. Madjar J.-J. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Vol. 2. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 135-139Google Scholar). 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to media for incorporation into confluent monolayers of Rat1a cells transfected either with the empty vector or 4EBPμ-expressing vector in 10-cm diameter dishes. Labeling continued for 3 h before the cells were harvested in buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min after addition of 0.7% Nonidet P-40. Mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for another 10 min. The post-mitochondrial supernatant was then adjusted to 0.5 m KCl and layered on top of a 1 m sucrose cushion. Ribosomes were pelleted through the cushion for 2 h at 245,000 × g. The ribosomal pellet was resuspended in buffer A, and [35S]methionine incorporation into the ribosomal fraction was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. To analyze the rate of synthesis of the ornithine decarboxylase protein, six 10-cm plates containing 60–70% confluent Rat1a cells either expressing the empty vector or the 4EBPμ were labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine per plate. Labeling was continued for 3 h in either 0.5 or 10% fetal bovine serum. Labeled cells were harvested in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× complete miniprotease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were first incubated for 1 h with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C to reduce background. After this initial reaction was centrifuged to remove the beads, 2.5 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) antibody (Affiniti Research Products, PW8880) was added and incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking at 4 °C. One hundred μl of protein A beads was then incubated for 30 min with the lysate containing the anti-ODC, and the lysates were again centrifuged to precipitate the beads. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer before 50 μl of protein gel loading buffer was added and run into standard 10% polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive incorporation into the immunoprecipitated ODC was assessed by overnight autoradiography of the gel. Translation initiation factor eIF4E is a particularly interesting mediator of cell growth and division because it transforms cells (7Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Google Scholar). We therefore chose to evaluate a molecular inhibitor of eIF4E, the eIF4E-binding protein (4EBP1; PHAS1) (53Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Google Scholar) as a potential inhibitor of eIF4E function. To evaluate possible mechanisms that might attenuate 4EBP1 effects in vivo (40Rousseau D. Gingras A.C. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2415-2420Google Scholar), we first tested the effect of the addition of 4EBP1 on translation rates of its own mRNA in vitro. We generated 4EBP1 mRNA in vitro, which was then translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of additional purified GST or GST-4EBP1 protein (Fig. 1A). 4EBP1 synthesis rates were determined by comparing radioactive [35S]methionine incorporation as demonstrated by autoradiography on standard protein gels. Purified 4EBP1 caused a minimal decrease in its own translation rate (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 4 and 5). On closer analysis, a slower migrating form of 4EBP1 appeared when purified GST-4EBP1 was added (lanes 4 and 5 in Fig. 1B). Treatment with λ phosphatase confirmed that the slower migrating form of 4EBP1 was phosphorylated. Our results suggested that addition of 4EBP1 results in a direct or indirect induction of 4EBP kinase activity present in the reticulocyte lysate. Autosensing of the translational environment by 4EBP1 was reported previously (54Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Google Scholar, 55Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Google Scholar) after inducible up-regulation of eIF4E and has been attributed to mTOR. We determined that this effect depends on a direct interaction between 4EBP1 and eIF4E because the translational inhibition and phosphorylation did not appear when a Leu58–Met59 → GA mutation in the interaction domain of 4EBP1 with eIF4E was added (Fig. 1C). To prevent inactivation of 4EBP by this autoregulatory mechanism, we simultaneously mutated its threonines 35, 45, and 69 and serine 64 to alanines. We sought to develop a constitutively active 4EBPμ that might provide a better reagent to study the role of translation initiation in growth control. We used pMV7 to develop mammalian expression constructs that contained no insert, 4EBP1 itself, or the constitutively active form of 4EBP1 (4EBPμ). We further inactivated the alanine-substituted mutant by an additional mutation in the interaction domain of 4EBP1 to prevent its interactions with eIF4E (4EBPμμ) (Fig. 1D). We initially studied Rat1a cells because eIF4E transformed them in a single step, as reported previously (46Stone J. de Lange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits E. Bishop J.M. Varmus H. Lee W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1697-1709Google Scholar) for c-myc. Rat1a cells were stably transfected using combinations of the constructs shown in Fig. 1D together with the control vector pCEP4 or pCEPeIF4E. The resulting plates were stained, and minimal changes in colony viability, number, and size were observed in response to the activated 4EBPμ (not shown). Single clones expressing the 4EBP constructs, but without eIF4E, were initially selected and tested for expression of 4EBP1 or 4EBPμ in Western assays (Fig. 1E). As seen in vitro, 4EBP1 migrated as doublets containing additional phosphorylated 4EBP1 whether it was the exogenous HA-tagged 4EBP1 or the endogenous 4EBP1 in the transfected cells (Fig. 1E, lane 2 versus lanes 3–7). No doublets were observed in cell lines transfected with the mutant HA-tagged 4EBPμ (Fig. 1F). Endogenous 4EBP1 showed a clear shift toward a preponderance of the phosphorylated up"

Although the structure of Fpg has been established, amino acid residues that define damage recognition have not been identified. We have combined molecular dynamics and bioinformatics approaches to address this issue. Site-specific mutagenesis coupled with enzyme kinetics was used to test our predictions. On the basis of molecular dynamics simulations, Lys-217 was predicted to interact with the O8 of extrahelical 8-oxoguanine accommodated in the binding pocket. Consistent with our computational studies, mutation of Lys-217 selectively reduced the ability of Fpg to excise 8-oxoguanine from DNA. Dihydrouracil, also a substrate for Fpg, served as a nonspecific control. Other residues involved in damage recognition (His-89, Arg-108, and Arg-109) were identified by combined conservation/structure analysis. Arg-108, which forms two hydrogen bonds with cytosine in Fpg-DNA, is a major determinant of opposite-base specificity. Mutation of this residue reduced excision of 8-oxoguanine from thermally unstable mispairs with guanine or thymine, while excision from the stable cytosine and adenine base pairs was less affected. Mutation of His-89 selectively diminished the rate of excision of 8-oxoguanine, whereas mutation of Arg-109 nearly abolished binding of Fpg to damaged DNA. Taken together, these results suggest that His-89 and Arg-109 form part of a reading head, a structural feature used by the enzyme to scan DNA for damage. His-89 and Lys-217 help determine the specificity of Fpg in recognizing the oxidatively damaged base, while Arg-108 provides specificity for bases positioned opposite the lesion.

Both 8-oxoG and FaPy lesions are removed by base excision repair (BER). The process of BER is initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases that hydrolyze the N-glycosidic bond to initiate excision of inappropriate nucleosides (12Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg, also termed MutM) initiates BER of 8-oxoG, FaPy-A, and FaPy-G (13Boiteux S. O'Connor T.R. Laval J.

Acting in concert with the adenine glycosylase, MutY, and the 8-oxodGTPase, MutT, Fpg significantly reduces the frequency of 8-oxoG-generated mutations in cells (16Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J.

Functional cooperation between Fpg and MutY is confirmed by the observation that Fpg fails to excise 8-oxoG from premutagenic 8-oxoG:A mispairs (14Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.-H. Laval J.

Instead, 8-oxoG:A is a substrate for MutY, a DNA glycosylase that excises A from this mispair (19Michaels M.L. Tchou J. Grollman A.P. Miller J.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), allowing downstream BER events to convert it to a 8-oxoG:C pair that is later acted upon by Fpg (16Michaels M.L.

Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 246-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Fpg bears significant sequence homology with another E. coli BER enzyme, endonuclease VIII (Nei) (20Jiang D.

Nei purges DNA of pyrimidine redox products, such as thymine glycols and dihydrouracil (DHU; Fig. 1A), showing little preference for the base positioned opposite the lesion (22Jiang D. Hatahet Z.

In addition to Nei, the Fpg family includes several recently identified mammalian homologs, which also excise oxidized purines and pyrimidines from DNA (23Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B.

In addition to acting as a DNA glycosylase, Fpg and Nei possess AP lyase activity that promotes cleavage of the DNA phosphodiester backbone through two sequential β-elimination reactions (22Jiang D.

A central step in this process is the formation of a covalent Schiff base intermediate involving Pro-1 of the enzyme and C1′ of the damaged nucleotide (28Zharkov D.O. Rieger R.A. Iden C.R. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5335-5341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Rieger R.A. McTigue M.M. Kycia J.H. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. Iden C.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 2000; 11: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This intermediate can be irreversibly trapped by reduction with sodium borohydride or cyanoborohydride (30Sun B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11671-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recently, we established the three-dimensional structures of E. coli Fpg (Eco-Fpg) and Nei cross-linked to DNA by sodium borohydride (32Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Gilboa R. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Kycia J.H. Rieger R.A. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 33Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19811-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The structures of uncomplexed Fpg from Thermus thermophilus (Tth-Fpg), as well as Fpg from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (Bst-Fpg) and Lactococcus lactis (Lla-Fpg) complexed with various DNA ligands, have been reported by others (34Sugahara M.

The three-dimensional structures of Fpg and Nei are very similar but differ in several significant details, some of which may underlie the different substrate specificities of these enzymes. Although structural data provides a wealth of information on the interactions of Fpg and Nei with damaged DNA, a disordered loop present in both structures is generally positioned so that it might be involved in recognition of the damaged base. In this study, we explore the role of various amino acid residues, including ones from the disordered loop, in determining the substrate specificity of Fpg. To generate testable hypotheses regarding these interactions, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of an Fpg/DNA complex containing a damaged base. Availability of three-dimensional structures for similar enzymes with different substrate specificities enables us to employ also a combined conservation/structure analysis (37Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to predict amino acid residues responsible for substrate specificity. We subsequently used site-directed mutagenesis to test the predictions obtained by these in silico approaches, which allowed us to identify several residues responsible for damage recognition by Fpg. Oligonucleotides and Enzymes—Oligodeoxynucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis were purchased from Invitrogen. 8-Oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine phosphoramidite was prepared as described previously (38Bodepudi V. Shibutani S. Johnson F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 608-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and other phosphoramidites, including DHU phosphoramidite, were purchased from Glen Research. Modified oligodeoxynucleotides for kinetic studies were synthesized by standard solid-state phosphoramidite chemistry and purified by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. The sequence used was 5′-CTC TCC CTT CXC TCC TTT CCT CT-3′, where X was 8-oxoG or DHU; the opposite strand was complementary except for containing A, C, G, or T opposite the modified base. The modified strand was labeled at the 5′-end using γ-[32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's protocol, and annealed to the complementary strand in the 1:1.3 ratio. Fpg was purified as described earlier (33Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19811-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Fpg mutants were produced by site-directed mutagenesis of the expression plasmid pET-24b (Novagen) carrying the wild-type fpg coding sequence inserted at NdeI-HindIII restriction sites. Recombinant plasmids were maintained in XL1-Blue E. coli. To obtain mutated Fpg proteins, plasmids were transfected into BL21(DE3) E. coli and the protocol for purification of the wild-type enzyme was followed (33Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19811-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) No significant difference in chromatographic behavior was observed between wild-type Fpg and the mutants. Determination of Kinetic and Dissociation Constants—Kinetic and dissociation constants for wild-type and mutant Fpg proteins were determined essentially as described (15Tchou J. Bodepudi V. Shibutani S. Antoshechkin I. Miller J. Grollman A.P. Johnson F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15318-15324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of substrates and enzymes and the time of reaction were adjusted to ensure steady-state rate conditions for the experiment. Kinetic constants were determined by nonlinear regression fit to the hyperbolic equation using Hyper v1.1 software. Molecular Dynamics Simulation—Simulations were carried out using the SANDER module of the AMBER 5.0 molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) software package (39Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2689) Google Scholar), the Cornell et al. force field (40Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar) and the parm99.dat parameter set (41Cheatham III, T.E. Cieplak P. Kollman P.A. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1999; 16: 845-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Non-bonded interactions were updated at each time step, a 9 Å cut-off was applied to Lennard-Jones interactions, periodic boundary conditions were applied, and MD simulations were carried out under constant pressure and temperature unless indicated otherwise. Coulombic interactions were approximated using the particle mesh Ewald method (42Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21400) Google Scholar), bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE option with a tolerance of 0.0005 Å, and a 2-fs time step was employed throughout the simulation. Coordinates of DNA covalently linked to Fpg protein, including a modeled loop (residues 217-224) that was not experimentally located in the crystal structure, were obtained as described (33Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19811-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The N-terminal proline residue, which acts as the nucleophile in Fpg catalysis (28Zharkov D.O. Rieger R.A. Iden C.R. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5335-5341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), was modeled as neutral to mimic the situation directly preceding the reaction. Residues not included in the AMBER force field were parameterized. Partial charges for the neutral N-terminal proline and 8-oxodG residues were obtained in the conformations used for the starting models. The conformation of Pro-1 in the crystal structure was used in the parameterization of this residue. For parameterization of 8-oxodG, three conformations that differed slightly in their χ angle were used to obtain partial charges. Hartree-Fock calculations, with the basis set 6-31G* in GAUSSIAN 98 (43Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Zakrzewski V.G. Montgomery Jr., J.A. et al.Gaussian. Vol. 98. Pittsburgh, PA2001Google Scholar), were used to calculate the partial charge of each atom in the parameterized residues. The RESP module of AMBER was used to fit each charge to its respective atomic center in the molecules (44Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5782) Google Scholar) and charges were normalized to avoid charge imbalance in each residue (45Wu X. Shapiro R. Broyde S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The final partial charges and atom type assignments for the Pro-1 and 8-oxodG residues are given under Supplementary Materials. Bond and angle parameters not included in the original force field were assigned by analogy to chemically similar types in the AMBER data base parm99.dat parameter set and are listed in Supplementary Materials. Starting structures were prepared using molecular modeling and potential energy minimization. The covalent bond linking Pro-1 and the ring-opened deoxyribose that comprises the reduced Schiff base (33Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19811-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and C1′ was broken and the deoxyribose moiety reconstituted. The modeled DNA sequence corresponded to that in the crystal structure, 5′-AGGAXGAAG-3′ where X denotes the lesion (Fig. 1B). An unmodified G or 8-oxoG was attached to the reconstituted sugar moiety with an initial glycosidic torsion angle of 294° (anti structure) or 110° (syn structure). Two additional simulations of 8-oxodG with initial glycosidic torsion angles of 317° and 255° were also carried out. These starting models were chosen for their apparent optimal steric and electrostatic/hydrogen bonding interactions between the damaged base and the substrate binding pocket. Three anti structures were analyzed because the O8 group of 8-oxoG was likely to interact with the modeled loop (residues 217-224), whose conformation was somewhat uncertain; visual inspection suggested three conformations of 8-oxodG with similar stabilizing interactions. However, in the syn conformation, damage-specific groups of 8-oxoG were positioned to optimally interact with protein residues well-defined in the crystal structure of E. coli Fpg; only one such region of the syn domain was located. Molecular modeling was carried out using the Builder module of InsightII (Accelrys). Once the DNA was remodeled, 750 steps of steepest descent (SD) and 250 steps of conjugate gradient potential energy minimization were carried out using the SANDER module of AMBER 5.0. Following minimization, 425 crystallographic water molecules were added to each system, and the systems were minimized for 600 steps of SD using the Hingerty distance-dependent dielectric function (46Hingerty B.E. Ritchie R. Ferrell T. Turner J. Biopolymers. 1985; 24: 427-439Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar), while holding the solute (protein and DNA) fixed using harmonic restraints of 0.1 kcal/mol. A total of 20 neutralizing Na+ counterions were then added to each system at positions of lowest electrostatic potential using the LEaP module of AMBER 5.0. The neutralized systems were minimized for 1000 steps of SD using the Hingerty distance dependent dielectric function while holding the solute fixed with harmonic restraints of 10 kcal/mol. The systems were reoriented using the Simulaid program (47Mezei M. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 812-815Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and then solvated in a box of TIP3P waters using a buffer of 10 Å. The solvating waters, crystallographic waters and counterions were minimized for 5000 steps of SD while keeping the solute fixed with 10 kcal/mol restraints. MD was carried out to equilibrate the system: 30 ps at 10 K holding the solute fixed with 10 kcal/mol restraints, 25 ps heating the system from 10 to 300 K holding the solute fixed with 10 kcal/mol restraints, 45 ps at 300 K holding the solute fixed with 10 kcal/mol restraints, 20 ps at 300 K holding the solute fixed with 1 kcal/mol, and 30 ps at 300 K holding the solute fixed with 0.1 kcal/mol restraints. Following 150 ps of equilibration, unrestrained production MD was carried out at 300 K for 1 ns. The cysteine residues involved in chelating the Zn2+ retained their relative orientations (data not shown), although the Zn2+ diffused out of the protein, due to the absence of other Zn2+ ions in the simulation. In Figs. 2 and S1, Zn2+ was modeled into the chelating position using the Builder module of Insight II (Accelrys). Coordinates, velocities, and energies for each simulated system were collected every 500 fs. The CARNAL and PTRAJ modules of AMBER were used for trajectory processing and analyses of the atomic fluctuations, critical torsion angles and distances, interactions between the solute and solvent and the occupancy and quality involving of the hydrogen bond between Fpg and its substrates. The hydrogen-bonding cutoff for the distance between heavy atoms was 3.4 Å and that for the hydrogen-bonding angle was 140°. Conservation Analysis—The protein sequence data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, composed of nonredundant sequences deposited in GenBank™, RefSeq, PDB, Swiss-Prot, PIR and PRF databases, was searched by BLASTP (48Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). The sequences of E. coli Fpg and Nei were used as initial queries with the search restricted to prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea). Sequences possessing neither the N-terminal PE(L/G) Fpg/Nei signature motif nor the C-terminal zinc finger motif were discarded. All remaining sequences were aligned using ClustalW (49Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). A tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method (50Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar), and the complete sequences most distant from the query sequences were used as queries for the second round of the search. Sequences identified were classified as the Fpg subgroup, based on the presence of the N-terminal motif PE(L/I/M)PE (124 sequences); the remaining 23 sequences, which contained the N-terminal signature motif PEG, were considered outside the Fpg subgroup and in the Fpg/Nei family. To analyze the conservation of physicochemical properties of the Fpg residues, subsets of the sequences were randomly selected (except that E. coli K12 sequences were always present) to represent no more than one per family, order, class, or phylum, then re-aligned. Conservation in the aligned sequences were analyzed by the AMAS algorithm (51Livingstone C.D. Barton G.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 745-756PubMed Google Scholar) with the threshold Cn = 9, 10% atypical residues allowed, no gaps ignored and cysteines considered reduced (37Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The structure of E. coli Fpg covalently complexed with DNA (1K82 in the Protein Data Bank) (33Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19811-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) was used for mapping similar and dissimilar residues, as described (37Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MD Simulation of Substrate Recognition by Fpg—Four simulations of Fpg complexed with an oligodeoxynucleotide containing 8-oxoG and two simulations of the protein with unmodified DNA were carried out for 1 ns following 150-ps equilibration. Stereoviews of the entire protein-DNA complex for the anti and syn 8-oxodG simulations are shown in Fig. 2 (A and B); views for 8-oxodG simulations 2 and 3 together with anti and syn unmodified controls are provided as Supplementary Material (Fig. S1). The 8-oxodG residue was modeled starting from four different χ torsion angles, three in the anti conformation range and one in the syn conformation (see “Materials and Methods” for details regarding the choice of the starting conformations). Following potential energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations, 8-oxodG was observed to fit into the active site pocket very well in either the anti or the syn conformation, assisted by a number of stabilizing van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. The unmodified dG residue also was modeled and simulated in both conformations. Each system had a relatively low RMSD from the starting structure, demonstrating the stability of each simulation. Fig. S2 shows the two-dimensional RMSD analysis of all residues in each system from the starting structure over the 1-ns simulations. The average RMSD for protein and DNA residues, as well as the RMSD of the final structure from the starting structure, are also shown in Fig. S2. The stability of the active site region, including 28 residues within 5Å of the target base and the base itself, also was monitored; two-dimensional plots are shown in Fig. S2. This analysis reveals that the modified base is very stable in the 8-oxodG simulations. The third metastable state in anti 8-oxodG simulation 3 coincides very closely with that of the simulation 1 stable state, exhibiting very similar conformations for the 8-oxodG residue and similar protein-DNA interactions; therefore, only simulation 1 will be discussed further for anti 8-oxodG unless otherwise specified. The time-dependent values of the substrate base glycosidic torsion are shown in Supplementary Material (Fig. S3); throughout the simulations, the anti and syn structures remained in their respective starting domains. Modeling of 8-oxoG within the active site and subsequent MD simulations allows specific interactions between Fpg and DNA containing the 8-oxoG base to be observed. Fig. 2 (C and D) shows the active site of the Fpg/anti 8-oxodG (simulation 1) and Fpg/syn 8-oxodG complexes following 1 ns of unrestrained MD."

Insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2), two major downstream molecules of IGF-1R, are known to be important in the genesis of diabetes. In this study, we have defined a new role of IRS in angiogenesis. Both of the IRS proteins modulate VPF/VEGF expression in pancreatic cancer cells by different mechanistic pathways. The Sp1-dependent VPF/VEGF transcription is regulated mainly by IRS-2. Protein kinase C-ζ (PKC-ζ) plays a central role in VPF/VEGF expression and acts as a switching element. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, but not the Ras pathway, is a downstream event of IRS proteins for VPF/VEGF expression in AsPC-1 cells. Interestingly, like renal cancer cells, in AsPC-1 cells PKC-ζ leads to direct Sp1-dependent VPF/VEGF transcription; in addition, it also promotes a negative feedback loop to IRS-2 that decreases the association of IRS-2/IGF-1R and IRS-2/p85. Taken together, our results show that in AsPC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells, Sp1-dependent VPF/VEGF transcription is controlled by IGF-1R signaling through IRS-2 proteins and modulated by a negative feedback loop of PKC-ζ to IRS-2. Our data also suggest that IRS proteins, which are known to play crucial roles in IGF-1R signaling, are also important mediators for tumor angiogenesis.

Our data also suggest that IRS proteins, which are known to play crucial roles in IGF-1R signaling, are also important mediators for tumor angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis, the formation of neovascularization from the existing blood vessels, is well known to be a crucial event in the growth of solid tumors by ensuring its blood supply (1Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1971; 285: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. Sci. Am. 1996; 275: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Several growth factors are able to induce tumor angiogenesis; of these, the vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) 1The abbreviations used are: VPF/VEGFvascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factorIGF-1insulin-like growth factor-1IGF-1Rinsulin like growth factor-1 receptorIRSinsulin receptor substrateMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasePI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePKCprotein kinase CEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPBSphosphate-buffered salinedNdominant negativePHpleckstrin homologyPTBphosphotyrosine bindingHAhemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: VPF/VEGFvascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factorIGF-1insulin-like growth factor-1IGF-1Rinsulin like growth factor-1 receptorIRSinsulin receptor substrateMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasePI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePKCprotein kinase CEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPBSphosphate-buffered salinedNdominant negativePHpleckstrin homologyPTBphosphotyrosine bindingHAhemagglutinin. is the most potent and specific (3Dvorak H.F. Nagy J.A. Fang D. Brown L.F. Dvorak A.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 237: 97-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). VPF/VEGF increases the permeability of microvessels and modulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration through its receptors KDR and Flt-1, as well as the recently found receptor neuropilin (4Fickle T. Karkkainen M. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol.

High blood vessel density in tumors is an independent predictor for metastasis (7Weidner N. Semple J.P. Welch W.R. Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 334: 1-8Crossref Scopus (5323) Google Scholar). Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the United States (8Sohn T.A. Yeo C.J. Surg. Oncol. 2000; 9: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, increased expression of VPF/VEGF is associated with liver metastasis and a poor prognosis for the patient (9Seo Y. Baba H. Fukuda T. Takashima M. Sugimachi K. Cancer. 2000; 88: 2239-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Recently we have shown that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) promotes proliferation, invasion, and VPF/VEGF expression in AsPC1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells through its receptor IGF-1R (10Zeng H. Datta K. Parangi S. Mukhopadhyay D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Lopez and Hanahan (11Lopez T. Hanahan D. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 339-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) also showed in a mouse model that an elevated level of IGF-1 receptor is responsible for the invasive and metastatic capability of pancreatic islet tumor cells. Elevated expression of the IGF-1 receptor occurs in a wide range of tumors (12Khandwala H.M. McCutcheon I.E. Flyvbjerg A. Friend K. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 215-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Of importance, the physiological roles of IGF-1R are cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and protection against apoptosis (13Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), but IGF-1R was also responsible for malignant transformation (14Nair P.N. de Armond D.T. Adamo M.L. Strodel W.E. Freeman J.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8203-8214Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and tumor progression (15Blakesley V.A. Stannard B.S. Kalebic T. Helman L.J. LeRoith D. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, in PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells, IGF-1R was found to cause invasion (16Tanno S. Tanno S. Mitsuuchi Y. Altomare D.A. Xiao G.H. Testa J.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 689-693Google Scholar), and in AsPC-1 it has been shown to be responsible for tumor cell growth and invasion (17Bergmann U. Funatomi H. Yokoyama M. Berger H.G. Korc M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2007-2011PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-1 has also been shown to induce angiogenesis by increasing the VPF/VEGF production in colorectal carcinoma (18Warren R. Yuan H. Matli M. Ferrara N. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29483-29488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and endometrial adenocarcinoma cells (19Bermont L. Lamielle F. Fauconnet S. Esumi H. Weisz A. Adessi G.L. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, there is no report that defines the signaling intermediates responsible for VPF/VEGF expression other than our recent observations that c-Src inhibitor PP-2 can inhibit VPF/VEGF transcription (10Zeng H. Datta K. Parangi S. Mukhopadhyay D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, in this study our focus was to understand the details of the signaling event mediated by IGF-IR for VPF/VEGF transcription. IGF-1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a 70% homology to the insulin receptor and shares parts of its functions (20Baserga R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5574-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to IGF-1R results in receptor autophosphorylation of the β-subunit (21Butler A.A. Yakar S. Gewolb I.H. Karas M. Okubo Y. LeRoith D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1998; 121: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and enables the association and tyrosine phosphorylation of two major downstream molecules: insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) (20Baserga R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5574-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). IRS proteins are already well known to play a crucial event in the development of diabetes (22White M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but they also play an important role in cancer. IRS-1 is constitutively activated in breast cancer, leiomyoma, Wilm's tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and adrenal cortical carcinoma (23Chang Q. Li Y. White M.F. Fletcher J.A. Xiao S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6035-6038PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in mouse medulloblastoma (24Wang J.Y. Del Valle L. Gordon J. Rubini M. Romano G. Croul S. Peruzzi F. Khalili K. Reiss K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3857-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, IRS-1 is the predominant signaling molecule for IGF-1R (25Jackson J.G. White M.F. Yee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9994-10003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), but progression of breast cancer was found to be associated with diminished IRS-1 levels (26Schnarr B. Strunz K. Ohsam J. Benner A. Wacker J. Mayer D. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 89: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). IRS-2 signaling causes enhanced adhesion and motility of metastatic breast cancer cells in vivo (27Jackson J.G. Zhang X. Yoneda T. Yee D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) as well as prostate cancer cells (28Reiss K. Wang J.Y. Romano G. Tu X. Peruzzi F. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both IRS proteins are signaling intermediates for α6β4 integrin-dependent cancer cell invasion (29Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5082-5093Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In pancreatic cancer, IRS-2 levels are shown to be elevated (30Kornmann M. Maruyama H. Bergmann U. Tangvoranuntakul P. Beger H.G. White M.F. Korc M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4250-4254PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the function of IRS proteins in VPF/VEGF expression in pancreatic cancer cells and thus in angiogenesis. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are scaffold molecules for both the insulin and the IGF-1 receptor (31Giovannone B. Scaldaferri M.L. Federici M. Porzio O. Lauro D. Fusco A. Sbraccia P. Borboni P. Lauro R. Sesti G. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2000; 16: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although they are not completely functionally interchangeable, they both promote two already well known signaling pathways: the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (21Butler A.A. Yakar S. Gewolb I.H. Karas M. Okubo Y. LeRoith D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1998; 121: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 31Giovannone B. Scaldaferri M.L. Federici M. Porzio O. Lauro D. Fusco A. Sbraccia P. Borboni P. Lauro R. Sesti G. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2000; 16: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PI3K was reported to induce VPF/VEGF expression in Ha-ras-transformed cells under hypoxic conditions (32Mazure N.M. Chen E.Y. Laderoute K.R. Giaccia A.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3322-3331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in osteoblast-like cells (33Akeno N. Robins J. Zhang M. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Clemens T.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). VPF/VEGF expression is increased under normoxic and hypoxic conditions by PI3K in astrocytoma cells, whereas the MAPK pathway only increased VPF/VEGF under normoxic conditions in these cells (34Woods S.A. McGlade C.J. Guha A. Neuro-oncology. 2002; 4: 242-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another group found that MAPK can up-regulate VPF/VEGF in hamster fibroblasts under normoxic and hypoxic conditions through Sp1 and HIF-1, respectively (35Berra E. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In renal cancer cells, we found Ras to be responsible for VPF/VEGF expression (36Pal S. Datta K. Khosravi-Far R. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2395-2403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PDK-1 is a downstream molecule of PI3K, which activates PKC-ζ among many other kinases (37Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein kinase is a member of the atypical PKCs. Unlike conventional or novel PKCs, it does not require diacylglycerol or phorbol esters for its activation, and its function is Ca2+-independent (38Shih S.-C. Mullen A. Abrams K. Mukhopadhyay D. Claffey K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15407-15414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To achieve catalytic potential, PKC-ζ needs to be phosphorylated on Thr-410 through PDK-1 (37Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). In this study of pancreatic cancer cells, we provide evidence that similar to renal cancer cells, PKC-ζ is a central molecule for VPF/VEGF expression. On the contrary, unlike renal cancer cells, in pancreatic cancer cells PKC-ζ becomes activated by PDK-1 only but not by Ras. Moreover, PKC-ζ turned out to be a switching molecule for VPF/VEGF expression, because it promotes a feedback loop to IRS-2. We have described a novel and diverse function of IRS proteins in the regulation of VPF/VEGF transcription. We observed that it is IRS-2 but not IRS-1 that controls Sp1-dependent VPF/VEGF transcription in pancreatic cancer cells. Taken together, our studies define a new role of IRS proteins in promoting VPF/VEGF expression and thus angiogenesis. Cell Culture—Human AsPC-1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells from ATCC were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 20% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories). Plasmids and Reagents—2.6- and 0.35-kb VPF/VEGF promoter firefly luciferase constructs for transient transfection assays contain sequences derived from the human VPF/VEGF promoter described earlier (40Mukhopadhyay D Tsiokas L. Sukhatma V.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6161-6165PubMed Google Scholar). PDK-1-phosphorylation site-mutated dominant negative T410A PKC-ζ (threonine 410 to alanine), the active myristoylated PKC-ζ (PKC-ζ-myr), and the kinase inactive myc-PDK-1.K/N (mutation of lysine 110 to asparagine) were generous gifts from Dr. Alex Toker (37Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PH-PTB IRS-1 and PH-PTB IRS-2, both in pcDNA, were described earlier (41Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 17N Ras, a dominant negative mutant of human Ras, a gift from Dr. Roya Khosravi-Far, was published earlier (42Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowsk-Wodnicka M. van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). p85, IGF-1 receptor-α antibody (1H7) (for blocking receptor), and IGF-1 receptor-β antibody (H60) (immunoprecipitation, Western blot) as well as nPKC-ζ antibody, anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase, anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies, and normal mouse and rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. IRS-2 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. HA antibody was from Roche Applied Science, M2 FLAG antibody came from Sigma. Rabbit serum was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The phosphoserine antibody came from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Transient Transfection—6–8 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate and 3–4 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate (luciferase assay), 2–3 × 105 cells/60-mm plate (real-time PCR), and 6–8 × 106 cells/100-mm plate (immunoprecipitation) were plated 1 day prior to transfection. Cell confluency was 85–95% for all experiments. Plasmids were transiently transfected using the Effectene method (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (a 1:10 DNA to Effectene ratio was used). For all experiments, a sample containing the empty vector was run. Luciferase Assay—Cells were harvested 30 h after transient transfection. Luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). An empty vector was used as a control in all assays. Results were normalized by total protein amount. All luciferase assays were performed at least four times, and the average and standard deviations were calculated. Immunoprecipitation—AsPC-1 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA, Boston Bioproducts) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% aprotinin, 2 mm pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, incubated for 10 min on ice, and scraped. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. 1 μg of antibody was added to an equal amount of protein from the lysate for each tube, in total 500 μl, and incubated for 2 h (overnight for IRS-2 antibody) on a rocking table at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and again incubated for 2 h under shaking conditions at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and proteins were separated by Western blot. Western Blot—Protein samples were mixed with 2× loading dye (125 mm Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, and 0.0025% bromphenol blue), boiled, and run on a 4–15% linear gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Agarose beads with bound proteins were treated in the same way. Electrophoresis was run at 150 V. Separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 300 mA for 1 h. For immunodetection, the membrane was blocked with 4% milk powder in PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with a primary antibody. After washing with PBS-T, the samples were coated with a peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. After a second washing, the reactive bands were detected by chemiluminescent substrate (Bio-Rad). RNA Preparation and Real-time PCR—After AsPC-1 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, total RNA was extracted according to the RNeasy kit protocol (Qiagen). We used the Taqman real-time PCR method. The sequence for forward, reverse and Taqman middle primers for human VPF/VEGF and for human β-actin (housekeeping gene) were taken from the PubMed GenBank™ (accession no. M10277) and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology: VPF/VEGF forward, 5′-TAC CTC CAC CAT GCC AAG TG-3′; VPF/VEGF reverse, 5′-GAT GAT TCT GCC CTC CTC CTT-3′; VPF/VEGF middle primer, 5′-TCC CAG GCT GCA CCC ATG GC-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-TCA CCA TGG ATG ATG ATA TCG C-3′; β-actin reverse, 5′-AAG CCG GCC TTG CAC AT-3′; β-actin middle primer, 5′-CGC TCG TCG TCG ACA ACG GCT-3′; IRS-1 forward, 5′-CAG GCA CAT CCC CTA CCA TTA-3′; IRS-1 reverse, 5′-ACT CCT CAA TGG AAG CCA CTG A-3′; IRS-1 middle primer, 5′-CCA CCA GAA GAC CCC GTC CCA-3′; IRS-2 forward, 5′-CCC ATG CGC AGA GAG A-3′; IRS-2 reverse, 5′-GCT CCT CCC TCA CGT CGA T-3′; IRS-2 middle primer, 5′-CTG CCG GTT TCC AGA ATG GTC TCA AGT AC-3′. All middle primers had a 5′-TET reporter and a 3′-Tamra quencher. Each real-time PCR reaction was done using 0.5 μg of total RNA, 25 μl of reverse transcriptase-PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 1.25 μl of RNase inhibitor (Applied Biosystems), 50 nm forward primer, 50 nm reverse primer, and 100 nm middle primer. In all VPF/VEGF real-time PCR experiments, the β-actin amount was detected in parallel as a housekeeping gene for normalization. For reverse transcription, a 30-min period at 48 °C was run before inactivating the reverse transcriptase at 95 °C for 10 min. 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min were performed with an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). CT (cycle threshold) values were measured, and the relative RNA amount was calculated as follows: Δ = CT(VPF/VEGF sample) – CT(β-actin sample). ΔΔ = Δ(transfected sample) – Δ(empty vector sample). The relative RNA amount in comparison with the empty vector = 2–ΔΔ. All experiments were carried out three times, and from each time the reading was taken in triplicate and the average and standard deviations were calculated. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from AsPC-1 cells following a standard protocol (59Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), with modifications. Cells were washed in cold PBS, suspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and incubated for 15 min on ice. Cells were then lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer C (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following incubation on a rotating rack for 25 min, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the clear supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were collected and stored at –70 °C. EMSAs were performed as described previously (59Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Briefly, EMSA binding reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.4), 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm ZnSO4, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin. The protein extracts and 200 ng of poly(dA-dT) were added at room temperature 10 min prior to the addition of ∼0.1 ng of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe. After a 20-min incubation at 4 °C, samples were run on 7% acrylamide gel in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA). The radiolabeled oligonucleotide used in EMSA studies was a double-stranded 22 mer that contains the consensus DNA-binding site for Sp1 (Promega, WI). The sequence of this Sp1 consensus double-stranded oligonucleotide is as follows: 5′-d(ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C)-3′ and 3′-d(TAA GCT AGC CCC GCC CCG CTC G)-5′. The oligonucleotide was radiolabeled with a 3′ end-labeling kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transcription Factor Sp1 Is Important for IGF-IR-induced VPF/VEGF Transcription—Our previous study revealed the role of the IGF-1 receptor in VPF/VEGF expression and thus angiogenesis (10Zeng H. Datta K. Parangi S. Mukhopadhyay D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the impact of the IGF-1 receptor downstream signaling molecules on VPF/VEGF expression in the pancreatic carcinoma cell line AsPC-1. VPF/VEGF transcription was measured by luciferase assays with two different VPF/VEGF promoter luciferase constructs (40Mukhopadhyay D Tsiokas L. Sukhatma V.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6161-6165PubMed Google Scholar): the 2.6-kb VPF/VEGF promoter, consisting of the full-length human VPF/VEGF promoter region; and the 0.35-kb VPF/VEGF promoter, which mainly contains the four putative Sp1 binding sites (59Mukhopadhyay D.

With these two constructs, we were able to measure Sp1-dependent and -independent VPF/VEGF transcription in AsPC-1. IGF-1 receptor signaling was blocked with anti-IGF-1Rα neutralizing antibody, and at the same time, either the 2.6-kb or the 0.35-kb VPF/VEGF luciferase construct was transfected into AsPC-1 cells. Luciferase activity of the 2.6-kb VPF/VEGF promoter showed a 50% decrease, and the 0.3–5kb VPF/VEGF promoter (mainly Sp1 binding sites) showed a 40% decrease compared with that of the IgG control (Fig. 1). These results suggest that in AsPC-1 cells, the IGF-1 receptor signaling promotes VPF/VEGF expression mainly through transcriptional regulation, where the transcription factor Sp1 plays an important role. In fact, the importance of Sp1 in VPF/VEGF transcription in pancreatic cancer cells has been reported previously by Shi et al. (60Shi Q. Le X. Abbruzzese J.L. Peng Z. Qian C. Tang H. Xiong Q. Wang B. Li X. Xie K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4143-4154PubMed Google Scholar). They showed that constitutive Sp1 activity is essential for differential constitutive expression of VPF/VEGF in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They also showed that mutation of individual or all of the putative Sp1 binding sites reduced or eliminated the constitutive high level of VPF/VEGF promoter activity in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (60Shi Q.

IRS-2, but Not IRS-1, Mediates Sp1-dependent VPF/VEGF Transcription—Both IRS-1 and IRS-2 act as downstream molecules of IGF-IR and mediate most of its functions (20Baserga R.

These mutants contain only the NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains of the IRS proteins but do not contain the COOH-terminal portion of the IRS proteins and thus are not able to transduce signals. The dominant negative effect of PH-PTB IRS-1 has been reported previously (45Tanaka S. Wands J.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2100-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Initially, we examined IRS-dependent VPF/VEGF mRNA expression by using mutants similar to those described above. Real-time PCR experiments, carried out after transfection of PH-PTP IRS-1 or IRS-2, showed a 50% decrease in the VPF/VEGF mRNA level (Fig. 2a). These experiments suggest that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are important upstream molecules for VPF/VEGF expression in AsPC-1 cells. To investigate the influence of IRS-1 and IRS-2 on Sp1-dependent or -independent VPF/VEGF transcription, we performed co-transfection assays using the 2.6-kb (full-length) or 0.35-kb (contains only Sp1 binding sites) VPF/VEGF promoter luciferase construct with increasing doses of PH-PTP IRS-1 or IRS-2 mutants (Fig. 2, b–e). For PH-PTB IRS-2, the luciferase activity of both VPF/VEGF promoter constructs (2.6b and 0.35 kb) decreased the dose dependence (Fig. 2, d and e). However, PH-PTB IRS-1 diminished only the 2.6-kb VPF/VEGF promoter luciferase activity; no significant change in the 0.35-kb promoter activity was detected (Fig. 2, b and c). These experi"

Purified condensin reconfigures DNA structure using energy provided by ATP hydrolysis. To know the regulation of condensin in somatic cells, the expression level, subcellular localization, and phosphorylation status of human condensin were examined during the cell cycle. The levels of condensin subunits were almost constant throughout the cell cycle, and the three non-SMC subunits were phosphorylated at specific sites in mitosis and dephosphorylated upon the completion of mitosis. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that a proportion of condensin was tightly bound to mitotic chromosomes and that this form was phosphorylated at specific sites. Condensin purified from mitotic cells had much stronger supercoiling activity than that purified from interphase cells. These results suggest that condensin functions in somatic cells are regulated by phosphorylation in two ways during the cell cycle; the phosphorylation of specific sites correlates with the chromosomal targeting of condensin, and its biochemical activity is stimulated by phosphorylation.

Chromatin undergoes extensive structural changes during the eukaryotic cell cycle. During mitosis, chromosome condensation takes place, which entails the conversion of entangled interphase chromatin fibers into rod-shaped chromosomes. Mitotic chromosome condensation is a prerequisite for the faithful segregation of genetic materials into daughter cells because it provides mechanical strength and reduces the length of chromosomes so that they can be transported effectively by the mitotic spindle to opposite poles. However, the molecular bases underlying the dynamic changes of higher order chromosome structure in mitosis have remained enigmatic (1Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Accumulating lines of genetic and biochemical evidence have revealed that a five-subunit protein complex, termed condensin, plays an essential role in mitotic chromosome assembly and organization (4Cobbe N.

Two core subunits of condensin, CAP-C/SMC4 and CAP-E/SMC2, belong to a large group of chromosomal ATPases, the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) 1The abbreviations used are: SMCstructural maintenance of chromosomesCSK buffercytoskeleton bufferPBS(-)calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate buffered salinePIPES1,4-piperazinediethane-sulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: SMCstructural maintenance of chromosomesCSK buffercytoskeleton bufferPBS(-)calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate buffered salinePIPES1,4-piperazinediethane-sulfonic acid. family (4Cobbe N.

The SMC2-SMC4 heterodimer forms a V-shaped structure with two long antiparallel coiled-coils. Condensin also contains three non-SMC subunits, CAP-D2, -G and -H, which bind to the ends of the SMC heterodimer (8Anderson D.E. Losada A. Erickson H.P. Hirano T. J.

A biochemical study using Xenopus egg extracts also shows that all of the subunits are required for chromosome condensation in vitro (6Hirano T. Mitchison T.J.

The functions of condensin have been addressed extensively using Xenopus egg extracts in which it has been found that the condensin complex binds to chromosomes in a mitosis-specific manner and is required for the establishment and maintenance of chromosome condensation (6Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 7Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M.

Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Purified condensin binds directly to DNA in vitro and displays DNA-stimulated ATPase activity (21Kimura K. Hirano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the presence of ATP, condensin promotes positive supercoiling in relaxed circular DNA with topoisomerase I (21Kimura K. Hirano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and it promotes positive 3-noded knots with topoisomerase II (25Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These activities are regulated by the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of the non-SMC subunits, which suggests that they may be physiologically relevant for mitotic chromosome condensation (26Kimura K. Hirano M. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. Science. 1998; 282: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recently, a study using electron spectroscopic imaging has revealed that a single condensin complex bound to DNA utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis to locally organize the DNA into two oriented supercoils (27Bazett-Jones D.P. Kimura K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Extensive analysis of condensin functions in fission yeast shows that the temperature-sensitive mutants cut3 and cut14, which have SMC subunit defects, fail to condense chromosomes during mitosis (10Saka Y. Sutani T. Yamashita Y. Saitoh S. Takeuchi M. Nakaseko Y. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4938-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of an N-terminal residue (Thr-19) of the Cut3 subunit by the cdc2 kinase is required for the accumulation of condensin in the nucleus and for chromosome condensation (11Sutani T. Yuasa T. Tomonaga T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2271-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Curiously, the cnd2 mutant, which is defective in a non-SMC subunit, is impaired in the DNA excision repair pathway and in the activation of a checkpoint kinase as well as in condensation, indicating that condensin has interphase functions in addition to its mitotic functions (28Aono N. Sutani T. Tomonaga T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Nature. 2002; 417: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A biochemical study revealed that the SMC heterodimer of fission yeast condensin efficiently promotes DNA reannealing from complementary single-stranded DNA to form double-stranded DNA (29Sutani T. Yanagida M. Nature. 1997; 388: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Less is known about human condensin than its Xenopus or fission yeast counterparts, but it has become the object of increasing attention. Human condensin consists of an SMC heterodimer (hCAP-C and hCAP-E) and three non-SMC subunits, hCAP-D2/CNAP1, hCAP-G, and hCAP-H (30Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell.

In human cells condensin is constitutively expressed, but its localization is regulated in a cell cycle-specific manner; during interphase it is found predominantly in the cytoplasm, and during mitosis it associates with chromosomes (30Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35Cabello O.A. Eliseeva E. He W.-G. Youssoufian H. Plon S.E. Brinkley B.R.

Condensin targets chromosomes during metaphase and dissociates from them during the anaphase-totelophase transition (23Maeshima K. Laemmli U.K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which condensin is targeted to chromosomes during mitosis is unknown. The human condensin complex can support chromosome condensation in Xenopus egg extracts that have been depleted of endogenous condensin (31Kimura K. Cuvier O. Hirano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5417-5420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The human condensin complex displays ATP-dependent supercoiling and knotting activities in vitro like its Xenopus counterpart but only when it is phosphorylated by cdc2-cyclin B (31Kimura K. Cuvier O. Hirano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5417-5420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These two results suggest that there are functional similarities between the human and Xenopus condensin complexes. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that endogenous condensin complex purified from M phase cells can support supercoiling and knotting reactions. Moreover, it is totally unknown how human condensin functions are regulated by phosphorylation during the cell cycle in somatic cells. In this study, we have focused on the relationship between phosphorylation and the mitosis-specific chromosomal targeting of the condensin complex. We have also precisely studied the correlation between phosphorylation and the biochemical activity of condensin during the cell cycle using synchronized HeLa cells. SDS buffer contains 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.6% SDS, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Mild lysis buffer contained 0.1 m Na-Pi (pH 7.2), 20 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25 m NaCl. CSK buffer contained 10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2,1mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm ATP, and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture set (Roche Applied Science). XBE2-gly contains 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 10% glycerol. Hypotonic buffer contains 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture set (Roche Applied Science). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of each human condensin subunit, as described previously (31Kimura K. Cuvier O. Hirano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5417-5420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Immunization and affinity purification of antibodies were performed as described previously (7Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). HeLa S3 cells were collected and washed twice with PBS(-) and frozen in N2 liquid for stock. Cell extracts were prepared under nondenaturing or denaturing conditions as follows. Nondenaturing Conditions—The frozen cells were thawed, suspended in CSK buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.3 m NaCl, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The suspension was separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 17,500 × g, and the supernatant was recovered. Denaturing Conditions—The frozen cells were thawed, suspended in SDS buffer, and boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. Four volumes of mild lysis buffer were then added, the mixture was centrifuged for 90 min at 50,000 × g, and the supernatant was recovered. HeLa S3 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin G potassium, 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 5% calf serum. Logarithmically growing HeLa S3 cells from suspension cultures were inoculated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 5% calf serum and 100 ng/ml TN-16 (Wako) at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/ml, incubated for 24 h to allow mitotic cells to accumulate, and harvested by centrifugation. The mitotic index of the cells collected in this method was greater than 90%. In some experiments, DNA content of the cells was measured with a laser scanning cytometer (Olympus). HeLa S3 cells (from suspension cultures) were labeled essentially as described previously (36Kimura K. Nozaki N. Enomoto T. Tanaka M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21439-21445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) except that they were incubated for 2 h with 3 MBq/ml [32P]orthophosphate or 1.5 MBq/ml [35S]methionine in medium containing 10-fold less phosphate or 10-fold less methionine, respectively. The chase period was initiated by washing the 32P- or 35S-labeled cells with warm PBS(-) twice. Equal aliquots of cells were plated into dishes containing chase media (radioisotope-free media containing 1 mm sodium phosphate or 1 mm methionine) and harvested at various times. Cell extracts prepared from the labeled cells were immunoprecipitated with condensin antibodies, examined by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed with an image analyzer (BAS-2500 FUJI Photofilm). Cell extracts were prepared under nondenaturing or denaturing conditions as described above. Affinity-purified antibody (2 μg) was added to the cell extracts, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °Cfor1h. Protein A-Sepharose beads (5 μl) were then added, and incubation was continued at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed 4 times with CSK buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl and 0.3% Triton X-100 (for extracts prepared under nondenaturing conditions) or with mild lysis buffer (for extracts prepared under denaturing conditions). The beads were then washed once with PBS(-), lysed in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. When necessary, competing peptides were added to immunoprecipitation reactions at a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml. For dephosphorylation experiments immunoprecipitates were incubated with 400 units of λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) at room temperature for 30 min. HeLa S3 cells (1 × 106) were lysed with 200 μl of CSK buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 30 min. The soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 2000 × g. The supernatants were recovered as the chromatin-unbound fraction (Fig. 5A, Fr. 1). The insoluble fraction was suspended in 200 μl of CSK buffer containing 200 units of DNase I, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 17,500 × g. The supernatants were recovered as the DNase-extractable fraction (Fig. 5A, Fr. 2). The pellets were suspended in 200 μl of CSK buffer containing 2 m NaCl and 0.3% Triton X-100 and centrifuged for 10 min at 17,500 × g. The supernatants were saved as the high salt extractable fraction (Fig. 5A, Fr. 3), and the pellets were saved as the high salt-resistant fraction (Fig. 5A, Fr. 4). We consider the DNaseextractable and high salt-extractable fractions as chromatin-bound fractions. Purification of HeLa condensin was performed as described previously (31Kimura K. Cuvier O. Hirano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5417-5420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Briefly, extracts prepared from 2 × 108 cells were mixed with 100 μg of anti-hCAP-G antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (200 μl) at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was transferred to a 1-ml disposable column, washed successively with 16 ml of XBE2-gly, 2 ml of XBE2-gly containing 0.4 m KCl, and 2 ml of XBE2-gly. Condensin was eluted from the column by the addition of XBE2-gly containing 0.4 mg/ml antigen peptides. The supercoiling assay was performed as described previously (24Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) except that relaxed circular 5-kilobase pGEX6p-1 DNA (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a substrate. Protein Levels of Condensin Subunits Are Almost Constant through the Cell Cycle—Condensin is a five-subunit protein complex that plays an essential role in mitotic chromosome condensation. Recently it has been shown that the subunit composition of condensin is also conserved in human cells (30Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5417-5420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but little is known about its regulation during the cell cycle in somatic cells. We prepared peptide antibody against each condensin subunit to monitor the levels of condensin by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A). When immunoprecipitation was performed on cellular extracts prepared under denaturing conditions, each antibody immunoprecipitated the corresponding subunit (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9). The specificity of the immunoprecipitation reaction was further confirmed by the addition of antigen peptides (Fig. 1C, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). The five human condensin subunits were immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts prepared under nondenaturing conditions by the anti-hCAP-E or anti-hCAP-G antibody, demonstrating that they associate with each other and form a complex in human cells similar to that observed in Xenopus egg extracts (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3). First we compared the level of each condensin subunit in log phase cells and in M phase cells by quantitative immunoblot analysis. The DNA contents of these cells were determined with a laser-scanning cytometer (Fig. 2A). We detected little difference in the levels of condensin subunits between log phase and M phase cells (Fig. 2B). We estimated that the hCAP-E subunit was present at 1 × 106 copies per cell (data not shown). We next monitored the levels of each condensin subunit during the cell cycle. HeLa cells were released from an S phase block, allowed to proceed synchronously into M phase, and then released from M phase into G1 phase. The progression of the cell cycle was monitored with a laser-scanning cytometer (Fig. 3A). We found that the levels of hCAP-E and hCAP-G were almost constant throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Protein level and phosphorylation of condensin subunits through the cell cycle. HeLa cells were accumulated in early S phase in the presence of aphidicolin and allowed to proceed through S phase after its removal. At 8 h TN-16 was added at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml to accumulate the cells in M phase, and at 16 h TN-16 was removed from the medium to release the cells into G1 phase. A, the DNA contents of the HeLa cells were determined with a laser scanning cytometer. The times after the release from S phase block were0h(lane 1),4h(lane 2),8h(lane 3), 10 h (lane 4), 12 h (lane 5), 14 h (lane 6), 16 h (lane 7), 17 h (lane 8), 18 h (lane 9), and 20 h (lane 10). B, whole cell extracts (5 μg of total protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against each condensin subunit. The times after the release from S phase block were the same as in A. C, whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by the anti-hCAP-E and anti-hCAP-G antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with the phospho-specific monoclonal antibody MPM-2. The time after the release from the S phase block was the same as in A.

Hirano M. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. Science. 1998; 282: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the SMC4 subunit of fission yeast condensin is phosphorylated at its N terminus sites in mitosis, a modification that is required for the relocation of condensin into nucleus at this time (11Sutani T. Yuasa T. Tomonaga T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2271-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that condensin functions are regulated by mitosis-specific phosphorylation but with different consequences for different species. In this study, we examined the phosphorylation status of human condensin subunits during the cell cycle. First, we compared log phase and M phase condensin. Condensin was immunoprecipitated from extracts prepared from log phase or M phase HeLa cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and the extent of phosphorylation was determined using an image analyzer. The subunit compositions of the two forms were indistinguishable, and four of the five subunits (hCAP-C, hCAP-D2, hCAP-G, and hCAP-H) were phosphorylated in both cases (Fig. 2C). There was little difference in the overall levels of phosphorylation in log phase and M phase forms of condensin. This observation differs from what has been found for Xenopus egg extracts, where condensin is phosphorylated in a mitosis-specific manner. However, it remains possible that specific sites on human condensin are phosphorylated during M phase. To test this hypothesis, we carried out immunoblotting experiments using the phospho-specific monoclonal antibody MPM-2, which recognizes a class of mitosis-specific phosphoproteins (37Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). We found that the hCAP-D2, hCAP-G, and hCAP-H subunits of M phase condensin acquired MPM-2 epitopes (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 3). The specificity of the phosphorylation was confirmed further by treatment of protein fractions with λ phosphatase (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 4). Next we monitored changes in the MPM-2 epitopes of condensin subunits over the cell cycle. Analysis of synchronized cells showed that the frequency of hCAP-D2, hCAP-G, and hCAP-H subunits with MPM-2 epitopes increased in M phase cells and that these epitopes were lost when the cells exited M phase (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that condensin is phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle but that specific sites (e.g. MPM-2 epitope sites) are phosphorylated in a mitosis-specific manner. Turnover of Condensin Subunits Is Relatively Slow in HeLa Cells—We examined the life span of condensin subunits by pulse-chase analysis. First, [35S]methionine-labeled log phase HeLa cells (2 h labeling) were transferred to label-free medium and harvested at various times. The hCAP-E and hCAP-G subunits of condensin were separately immunoprecipitated from extracts prepared under denaturing conditions and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the 35S label was detected using an image analyzer (Fig. 4A, upper). The intensity of radioactivity was quantified to provide a degradation curve for each subunit (Fig. 4A, lower left). The half-lives of the hCAP-E and hCAP-G subunits, as determined from semilog plots (Fig. 4A, lower right), were found to be 17 h (for the 0-8-h interval) and 27 h (for the 8-48-h interval) for hCAP-E and 18 h (0-8 h) and 27 h (8-48 h) for hCAP-G. Thus, newly synthesized condensin subunits were more stable after 8 h of the chase period (see “Discussion”). Next, the condensin complex was immunoprecipitated with the anti-hCAP-E or anti-hCAP-G antibody from [35S]methionine-labeled cell extracts prepared in the absence of SDS. The 35S labels were detected using an image analyzer (Fig. 4B, le"
https://openalex.org/W2073987277,"A single Cys replacement of Glu at position 252 (E252C) in loop VIII–IX of NhaA increases drastically the Km for Na+ (50-fold) of the Na+/H+ antiporter activity of NhaA and shifts the pH dependence of NhaA activity, by one pH unit, to the alkaline range. In parallel, E252C causes a similar alkaline pH shift to the pH-induced conformational change of loop VIII–IX. Thus, although both the Na+/H+ antiporter activity of wild type NhaA and its accessibility to trypsin at position Lys249 in loop VIII–IX increase with pH between pH 6.5 and 7.5, the response of E252C occurs above pH 8. Furthermore, probing accessibility of pure E252C protein in dodecyl maltoside solution to 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)-naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid revealed that E252C itself undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change, similar to position Lys249, and the rate of the pH-induced conformational change is increased specifically by the presence of Na+ or Li+, the specific ligands of the antiporter.

Sodium proton antiporters are ubiquitous membrane proteins found in the cytoplasmic and organelle membranes of cells of many different origins, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. They are involved in cell energetics and play primary roles in the regulation of intracellular pH, cellular Na+ content, and cell volume (reviews in Refs. 1Padan E. Schuldiner S. Konings W.N.

Only NhaA is indispensable for adaptation to high salinity, for challenging Li+ toxicity, and for growth at alkaline pH (in the presence of Na+ (1Padan E. Schuldiner S. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R.

A Practical Guide to Membrane Protein Purification. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands2002: 179-190Google Scholar). Recently two-dimensional crystals of NhaA diffracting at 4 Å were obtained. Cryoelectron microscopy of these crystals showed that NhaA exists as a dimer of monomers composed each of 12 helices as predicted (9Rothman A. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32288-32292Google Scholar, 10Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Google Scholar, 11Williams K.A. Geldmacher-Kaufer U. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3558-3563Google Scholar). In the native membrane NhaA forms oligomers within which the monomers physically and functionally interact (12Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Google Scholar). Based on the two-dimensional crystals, a three-dimensional map of NhaA was obtained (13Williams K.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 112-115Google Scholar), the first insight into the architecture of the protein.One of the most interesting characteristics of NhaA is its dramatic dependence on pH; both in isolated membrane vesicles and when purified in proteoliposomes its rate of activity changes more than 3 orders of magnitude between pH 7 and 8 (3Padan E. Venturi M. Gerchman Y. Dover N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 144-157Google Scholar, 6Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Google Scholar). Amino acid residues involved in the pH response of NhaA have been identified in both loops and TMSs. 1The abbreviations used are: TMStransmembrane segmentNEMN-ethylmaleimideMIANS2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)-naphthalene-6-sulfonic acidMTSET[2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methane thiosulfonateMTSES(2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonateBTP1,3-bis-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]amino]propaneNTAnitrilotriacetic acidMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidDMn-dodecyl-β-d-maltosideCLCys-less NhaA.1The abbreviations used are: TMStransmembrane segmentNEMN-ethylmaleimideMIANS2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)-naphthalene-6-sulfonic acidMTSET[2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methane thiosulfonateMTSES(2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonateBTP1,3-bis-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]amino]propaneNTAnitrilotriacetic acidMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidDMn-dodecyl-β-d-maltosideCLCys-less NhaA. For example, His225 in loop VII–VIII was found essential for the pH response of the antiporter (14Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Google Scholar, 15Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26813-26817Google Scholar). Gly338 of TMS XI also affects the pH response of NhaA; its replacement with serine (G338S) produced a transporter that, in contrast to the wild type protein, lacks pH control (16Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Google Scholar).NhaA undergoes a conformational change upon its activation by pH. Monoclonal antibody 1F6 raised against the NhaA antiporter (17Padan E. Venturi M. Michel H. Hunte C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 53-58Google Scholar) identified that the N terminus of NhaA, its epitope, responds to pH (18Venturi M. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Hunte C. Padan E. Michel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4734-4742Google Scholar). The antibody binds NhaA at pH 8.5 but not at pH 4.5. Furthermore, H3C/H5C, a double mutation in this domain, changes the pH profile of NhaA (18Venturi M. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Hunte C. Padan E. Michel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4734-4742Google Scholar).Probing with trypsin digestion showed that Loop VIII–IX is another domain that changes its conformation with pH (19Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Google Scholar). Both in everted membrane vesicles as well as in DM micelles, NhaA is completely resistant to trypsin below pH 6.5 and with increasing pH is progressively cleaved at Lys249, reaching a maximum at pH 8.5. Furthermore, two NhaA mutants (H225R (19Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Google Scholar) and G338S (16Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Google Scholar)) with a modified pH profile are susceptible to trypsin, in isolated membrane vesicles, at Lys249, only at the pH range where they are active and reflecting the level of activity.Two pieces of evidence suggest that Loop VIII–IX not only responds to pH but is also required for pH regulation: (a) Loop VIII–IX is located in the interface between monomers of NhaA dimer (12Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Google Scholar). Cross-linking between these loops of the NhaA dimer with a rigid and short cross-linking agent caused a dramatic change in the pH response as opposed to no effect of a long and flexible cross-linking reagent (12Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Google Scholar). (b) Insertion mutation Lys249-IEG-His250 and Cys replacement mutations E241C and V254C in loop VIII–IX cause an acidic shift in the pH profile of NhaA (19Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Google Scholar).In addition to Glu241, loop VIII–IX contains only one other Glu (at position 252). In this paper, we therefore, replaced Glu252 with Cys and explored the properties of the E252C mutant both in the membrane and after solubilization and purification of the protein in DM. We found that in contrast to E241C and the other two mutations in loop VIII–IX that induce an acidic shift in the pH profile of activity of NhaA, the single amino acid change, E252C, causes a dramatic alkaline shift in the pH dependence of the Na+/H+ antiporter activity of NhaA and increases drastically the Km of the antiporter to both Na+ and Li+. In parallel, the E252C mutation causes a similar alkaline shift in the pH dependence of the conformational change in loop VIII–IX. Remarkably, this conformational change at position E252C was found sensitive specifically to both Na+ and Li+, the specific ligands of the NhaA antiporter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—EP432 is an E. coli K12 derivative, which is melBLid, Δ nhaA1::kan, Δ nhaB1::cat, Δ lacZY, thr1 (5Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Google Scholar). TA16 is nhaA+nhaB+lacIQ and otherwise isogenic to EP432 (6Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Google Scholar). The cells were grown in modified L broth (LBK) in which NaCl was replaced by KCl (67 mm, pH 7.5). When indicated, the media was buffered by 60 mm BTP, and pH was titrated with HCl. The cells were also grown in minimal medium A without sodium citrate (20Davies B. Mingioli E. J. Bacteriol. 1950; 60: 17-28Google Scholar) with glycerol (0.5%) as a carbon source. Thiamine (2.5 μg/ml) was added to all minimal media. For EP432, threonine (0.1 mg/ml) was also added (4Padan E. Maisler N. Taglicht D. Karpel R. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20297-20302Google Scholar). For plates, 1.5% agar was used. The antibiotics and their concentrations were 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Resistance to Li+ and Na+ was tested as described previously (4Padan E. Maisler N. Taglicht D. Karpel R. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20297-20302Google Scholar).Plasmids—The plasmids encoding wild type NhaA used in this study were as follows. pECO2, a derivative of pECO (21Galili L. Rothman A. Kozachkov L. Rimon A. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 609-617Google Scholar), was constructed by purification of the BstXI-BstXI fragment (5188 bp) obtained from pECO (21Galili L. Rothman A. Kozachkov L. Rimon A. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 609-617Google Scholar), teaming with T4 DNA polymerase and blunt end self-ligation and destroying the two BstXI sites of the plasmid. pBSTX is a derivative of pECO2 that contains a silent mutation introducing a BstXI site at codon 250 of nhaA. For construction of pBSTX, two fragments of nhaA were PCR-amplified using pGMAR100 (16Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Google Scholar) as a template and the end and mutagenic primers shown in Table I. The two fragments were annealed and used as a template for PCR amplification with the same end primers. The BglII-MluI fragment (682 bp) of the amplicon was ligated with BglII-MluI fragment (4502 bp) of pECO2.Table IPrimers used for constructing of NhaA mutantsMutationDNA sequence of mutagenic oligonucleotideCodon change observedNew restriction siteE252CGCGACTGTGTCACGTGTTGCACCCGAG → TGTEco72IA248GTTCTCCAGCCAAGCGACTGGAGCATGTGGCG → GCCBstXI5′ end primer aCTGATGCAAGGATCGCTAGCCAGC5′ end primer bGAAGGGTGGGCGATCCCGGCGGCTAC3′ end primerGCTCATTTCTCTCCCTGATAAC Open table in a new tab The plasmid used encoding Cys-less (CL) NhaA was pCL-BSTX that was constructed in a fashion similar to pBSTX but using pCL-GMAR100 (21Galili L.

Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Google Scholar), whereas the plasmid expressing His6-tagged CL-NhaA was pCL-AXH2 (12Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Google Scholar). All plasmids carrying a mutation were designated by the name of the plasmid followed by the mutation. Plasmids pCL-AXH2-H225C, pCL-AXH2-K221C, pCL-AXH2-A118C, and pCL-AXH2-N177C were described previously (12Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E.

Pullen J. Pease L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). pBSTX-E252C and pCL-BSTX-E252C were constructed using plasmids pBSTX and pCL-BSTX as a template and the mutagenic primers described in Table I. In each case the entire fragment originated by PCR and cloned in a plasmid was sequenced through the ligation junction to verify the accuracy of mutagenesis.pAXH2-E252C and pCL-XH2-E252C were obtained by replacing the MluI-BglII fragments of plasmids pAXH2 and pCL-XH2 with MluI-BglII fragments excised either from pBSTX-E252C or pCL-BSTX-E252C to obtain the mutation in either wild type or CL genetic background respectively.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Google Scholar), 15 μgof affinity-purified protein was resuspended in 0.5 ml containing 0.1 m KCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% DM, and 50 mm Tris-HEPES at the indicated pH values. After the addition of 0.3 μg of trypsin (Sigma, type III), the suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.9 μg of trypsin inhibitor type II (Sigma) dissolved in 1 mm HCl (200 μg/ml). Then the protein was precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 0.5 h at 4 °C, centrifuged (Eppendorf, 14.000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), resuspended in sampling buffer, titrated to neutrality with Tris base, and loaded on the gel for SDS-PAGE as described (27Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar).Treatment with SH Reagents—Everted membrane vesicles or high pressure membranes were isolated from EP432 cells transformed with the indicated plasmids. The membranes (0.5 mg of membrane protein) were resuspended in a reaction mixture (0.5 ml) containing 5 mm MgSO4, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 mm NEM (Sigma), and MTSES or MTSET (10 mm each) and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with gentle shaking. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mm dithiothreitol and 3 ml of TSC solution containing 10 mm Tris/Cl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, and 140 mm choline chloride. The membranes were centrifuged (Beckman, TLA 100.4, 75000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in the same buffer (5–10 mg of membrane protein/ml). For measurement of Na+/H+ antiporter activity of the treated membranes, ATP was used to energize the membranes because NEM inactivates the lactate-dependent respiration.To determine accessibility to NEM or other SH reagents, the membranes (0.5 mg of membrane protein) were resuspended in 1.15 ml of TSC supplemented with 14% glycerol, 1% DM, and 0.06 m MOPS (pH 7). The suspension was incubated for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifuged (Beckman, TLA 100.2, 75000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was added to 100 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and incubated with agitation for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice in binding buffer (10Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Google Scholar) at pH 7.4 and resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing 0.2 mm fluorescein 5-maleimide (Molecular Probes) with gentle tilting for 30 min at 25 °C and washed in washing buffer (10Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Google Scholar) at pH 7.4. The protein was eluted in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sampling buffer supplemented with 300 mm imidazole, agitated for 20 min at 4 °C, and collected in the supernatant after centrifugation (Eppendorf, 14.000 rpm, 2 min, 4 °C). The affinity-purified protein was separated on SDS-PAGE. For evaluation of the fluorescence labeling, SDS-PAGE gels were photographed under UV light (260 nm) as described (22Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Google Scholar).Labeling of NhaA Mutants with MIANS and Fluorescence Measurement—For treatment with MIANS (Molecular Probes) the protein was affinity-purified on Ni+2-NTA with acid elution. The reaction mixture (2.5 ml) contained 0.03% DM, 50 mm BTP/Cl at the indicated pH values and MIANS (4 μm). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the affinity-purified protein (20 μg of protein). Fluorescence was monitored continuously at 22 °C with a spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using an excitation wavelength of 330 nm (8-nm slit) and an emission wavelength of 415 nm (4-nm slit).RESULTSCys Replacements Mutants of Loop VIII–IX—The Cys-less-NhaA (CL-NhaA) is expressed similar to the wild type protein and is as active (Fig. 1D and Refs. 10Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Google Scholar and 22Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Google Scholar). We constructed the Cys replacement mutation E252C in loop VIII–IX of both wild type and CL-NhaA. The mutated NhaA proteins were designated E252C and CL-E252C, respectively. To characterize the phenotypic properties conferred by the NhaA mutations, the mutant plasmids were transformed into EP432, a ΔnhaA-nhaB strain. This strain can grow in high Na+-selective media (0.6 m NaCl at pH 7 or 8.3) only when it expresses a functional NhaA. Hence, when transformed with plasmids bearing NhaA mutations, this host allows characterization of the effect of the mutations on cell and membrane phenotype.Fig. 1D shows that both mutants of NhaA, E252C and CL-E252C, were expressed in EP432 cells, even better than the wild type and the CL-NhaA, their respective controls. As compared with E252C mutant, CL-E252C mutant showed somewhat lower expression (Fig. 1D).When Na+ was not added to the growth medium, the growth at both pH 7 and 8.3 of EP432 expressing either E252C or CL-E252C was similar to that expressing the wild type antiporter or its CL derivative (data not shown). In the selective medium, the growth of EP432 expressing E252C was very similar to that expressing the wild type protein with respect to both number and size of the colonies (Table II). The colony size of both strains was slightly smaller at alkaline pH than at neutral pH (Table II). On the other hand, the mutant CL-E252C conferred preferential growth at alkaline pH; although at both pH 7 and pH 8.3, the number of colonies of all strains was similar, the colony size of cells expressing CL-E252C was very small at pH 7, but at alkaline pH, it was even larger than that of wild type, CL-E252C, and E252C (Table II). It is not clear why CL-E252C but not E252C exhibits a pH-shifted growth phenotype.Table IICell and membrane phenotype of E252C and CL-E252C mutationsEncoded NhaA* variantPlasmidGrowth (0.6 M NaCl)Km (pH 8)pH 7pH 8.3NaClLiClpBR322--NhaApBSTX+++++0.20.02CL-NhaApCL-BSTX+++++0.2NDE252CpBSTX-E252C+++++9.9NDCL-E252CpCL-BSTX-E252C++++11.34 Open table in a new tab E252C Shifts the pH Dependence of the Na+/H+Antiporter Activity of NhaA to the Alkaline Range—To determine the Na+/H+ antiporter activity, everted membrane vesicles were isolated from EP432 expressing either E252C or CL-E252C. The Na+/H+ antiporter activity was measured at various pH values. The assay was based on the measurement of the ΔpH maintained across the membrane by respiration or H+/ATPase as determined from fluorescence quenching of acridine orange. The Na+/H+ antiporter activity was assessed from the dequenching caused by the addition of Na+. Membranes derived from EP432 cells transformed with the vector plasmid have no Na+/H+ antiporter activity (data not shown and (5Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Google Scholar)). Transformation with a plasmid expressing wild type NhaA restores Na+/H+ antiporter activity (5Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Google Scholar) that as shown previously changes dramatically as a function of pH (Refs. 3Padan E. Venturi M. Gerchman Y. Dover N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 144-157Google Scholar and 6Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Google Scholar and Figs. 1, A–C, and 2). The results show that both NhaA mutants, E252C and CL-E252C, behave differently; at pH 7 where wild type NhaA shows between 15 and 20% of its maximal activity, both E252C mutants do not show any activity (Figs. 1A and 2). Furthermore, at pH 8 (in the presence of 10 mm Na+) when the wild type exhibits 100% activity (Figs. 1B and 2), E252C and CL-E252C mutants show about 30% of their maximal activity as observed at pH 9 (Figs. 1, B and C, and 2). The results suggest that whether in a wild type or CL genetic background, the E252C mutation causes a drastic alkaline shift, of 1 pH unit, in the pH dependence of NhaA.Fig. 2The E252C mutation drastically shifts the pH dependence of NhaA to the alkaline range. Plasmid transformed cells, growth conditions, isolation of membrane vesicles, and measurement of Na+/H+ antiporter activity at various pH values were as described in Fig. 1. The percentages of dequenching observed following the addition of 10 mm (open symbols) or 100 mm NaCl (filled symbols) are shown versus the pH of the assay. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and the results were essentially identical. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Effect of E252C on the Km of NhaA—The Km values for Na+ of the Na+/H+ antiporter activity of E252C and CL-E252C mutants as compared with those of the wild type were measured at both pH 8 (Table II) and pH 8.5 (data not shown). At both pH values, the apparent Km for the Na+ ion (10 mm) of both mutants was drastically increased as compared with the wild type (0.2 mm). The Km for Li+ was also increased by the mutations, but the effect was less drastic than that for Na+ (Table II). The results summarized in Fig. 2 show that the drastic shift in the pH profile of the Na+/H+ antiporter activity of both E252C and CL-E252C mutants is maintained even at saturating Na+ concentrations. Hence, the mutation E252C has an effect on the pH dependence of NhaA that is independent of its effect on the Km of the antiporter.E252C Causes an Alkaline Shift to the pH-dependent Conformational Change of NhaA as Probed by Trypsin—Although NhaA has many trypsin-cleavable sites, trypsin digests NhaA, either in the native membrane or when purified in DM micells, only at Lys249 in loop VIII–IX (19Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Google Scholar, 28Rothman A. Gerchman Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14572-14576Google Scholar). Furthermore, the pH dependence of the digestion was identical in both NhaA preparations and reflected the pH dependence of the Na+/H+ activity of the antiporter (19Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Google Scholar, 28Rothman A. Gerchman Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14572-14576Google Scholar). To explore the pH dependence of the digestion by trypsin of E252C mutant, E252C protein was affinity-purified in DM and subjected to trypsin at various pH values (Fig. 3B). The results show that in contrast to the wild type protein that is progressively digested between pH 6.5 to pH 8.5 (Fig. 3A), the mutant is resistant to trypsin up to pH 8.5 and only between pH 8.5 and 9 is digested (Fig. 3B). It is also apparent that the two proteolytic fragments (Fig. 3B, HF and LF) obtained from the mutant protein are identical in size to those obtained from the wild type protein (Fig. 3A and Ref. 19Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Google Scholar). Identical behavior was obtained with mutant CL-E252C (data not shown). Hence, the alkaline shift caused to the pH profile of the antiporter activity by mutation E252C is reflected in a similar shift in the pH dependence of the conformational change of NhaA at position 249, as probed by trypsin.Fig. 3The E252C mutation drastically shifts the pH dependence of digestion of NhaA by trypsin to the alkaline range. TA16 cells transformed with plasmids pAXH2 (A) or pAXH2-E252C (B and C), encoding His-tagged wild type NhaA ((His)6-WT) or His-tagged E252C ((His)6-E252C), respectively, were grown in medium A and overexpressed with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm), and high pressure membranes were isolated. The His-tagged proteins were affinity-purified in 0.1% DM on Ni+2-NTA from the membranes with no further treatment (A and B) or after treatm"
https://openalex.org/W2009159412,"Pax9 is a paired domain-containing transcription factor that plays an essential role in the patterning of murine dentition. In humans, mutations in PAX9 are associated with unique phenotypes of familial tooth agenesis that mainly involve posterior teeth. Among these, a frameshift mutation (219InsG) within the paired domain of PAX9 produces a protein product associated with a severe form of molar agenesis in a single family. The objectives of this study were to gain new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of the 219InsG mutation and its role in tooth agenesis. Here we describe functional defects in DNA binding and transactivation of mutant 219InsGPax9. Although wild type Pax9 binds to the high affinity paired domain recognition sequences, e5 and CD19-2(A-ins), the 219InsGPax9 mutant protein was unable to bind to these cognate DNA-binding sites. In co-transfection assays, wild type Pax9 activated reporter gene transcription although the mutant was transcriptionally inactive. Immunolocalization data show that Pax9 and 219InsGPax9 proteins are synthesized in mammalian cells but that the nuclear localization of the mutant Pax9 protein is altered. Furthermore, transactivation by the full-length Pax9 protein from paired domain binding sites was not impaired by the 219InsGPax9 mutant. The latter did not alter the DNA binding activities of wild type Pax9 in gel mobility shift assays. The combined defects in DNA binding activities and transactivation function of mutant 219InsGPAX9 likely alter the selective activation and/or repression of PAX9 effector genes during odontogenesis. This loss-of-function of PAX9 most likely results in its haploinsufficiency during the patterning of dentition and the subsequent loss of posterior teeth.

This loss-of-function of PAX9 most likely results in its haploinsufficiency during the patterning of dentition and the subsequent loss of posterior teeth. PAX9 belongs to the PAX family of transcription factors that play pivotal roles in embryonic patterning and in disease (1Noll M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Related to the paired gene in Drosophila melanogaster, proteins of this family are characterized by a highly conserved 128-amino acid motif that encodes the paired domain. The paired domain is structurally composed of two distinct helix-turn-helix motifs that mediate sequence-specific interaction with DNA, primarily with target genes containing the core GTTC motif (2Treisman J. Harris E. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In addition to the paired domain, the 341-amino acid polypeptide chain encoding the PAX9 gene possesses, at least, another functionally distinct domain that functions putatively as a transactivation domain. Although detailed characterization of the transactivation domain of PAX9 is currently unavailable, sequence homology with potent transactivator proteins localizes the putative transactivation function to the proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich C-terminal domain of PAX9. In humans, the identification of several novel PAX9 mutations in individuals with posterior teeth agenesis confirms that PAX9 protein is critical for the patterning of dentition (3Mostowaska A. Kobielak A. Trzeciak W.H. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2003; 111: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).In mouse embryos, Pax9 is an early marker of tooth development, appearing in odontogenic mesenchyme before ectodermal thickening and prior to the expression of other tooth signaling genes. High levels of Pax9 expression persist in the mesenchyme during the bud and cap stages and are down-regulated at the late bell stage of developing dentition (4Neubüser A. Koseki H. Balling R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Functional deletion of Pax9 in mice results in neonatal lethality and an arrest of tooth development at the bud stage (5Peters H. Neubüser A. Kratochwil K. Balling R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2735-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The expression of Pax9 also modulates the expression of crucial developmental regulatory genes, such as Msx1 and Bmp4, and antagonistic interactions between Fgf8 and Bmp2 or Bmp4 control the initiation of Pax9 expression in mandibular mesenchyme (6Bei M. Maas R. Development. 1998; 125: 4325-4333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Peters H. Balling R. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Pax9-dependent odontogenic activities constitute part of a complex process that is not yet fully understood at the molecular level. How and which of the Pax9-regulated processes are altered by mutations in the gene is an issue of current biological importance. Clearly, functional studies of PAX9 and of disease-causing PAX9 genes will provide an understanding of the molecular processes regulated by the gene during tooth development and, in the broader context, offer valuable insights into the molecular basis for disease susceptibility.To provide functional evidence for the pathogenic role of mutant PAX9 proteins, we have undertaken comparative functional analyses of the wild type PAX9 protein and the gene product of a mutant 219InsGPAX9 responsible for a severe lack of posterior teeth in humans (8Stockton D.W. Das P. Goldenberg M. D'Souza R.N. Patel P.I. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The 219InsG mutation is a guanine insertion at nucleotide 219 that produces a frameshift and alters the amino acid residues downstream of Gly-73. A premature stop created at 243 codons downstream of the site of the guanine insertion generates an aberrant PAX9 transcript having 25 fewer amino acids than the wild type PAX9. Predictably, key conserved residues in the DNA-recognition helices of the paired domain are altered by the resultant frameshift. The lack of homology between wild type and 219InsGPAX9 residues extends into the C-terminal domain and suggests that other structural and functional domains, in addition to the paired domain and its DNA binding activities, are compromised by this mutation. Consequently, we hypothesized that 219InsG mutation likely inactivates the DNA binding activities of 219InsGPAX9 protein and abrogates PAX9-mediated transactivation of target genes.To evaluate the functional consequences of the mRNA expression of the mutant 219InsGPAX9 gene, we examined whether the aberrant expression of 219InsGPAX9 corresponds to a non-functional protein or to a protein with an alternative function. We were guided in this study by the rationale that a biochemical study of the truncated 219InsGPAX9 protein will assist in delineating the structure-function correlation of PAX9 and in defining important aspects of the molecular mechanism underlying PAX9-mediated tooth agenesis. In this report, we examine the effect of the 219InsG mutation on the DNA binding activities and on the transactivation function of PAX9, and we provide a molecular basis for the observed differences in functional activities. We present evidence that the 219InsGPAX9 protein is defective in DNA binding activities and demonstrate that this mutant polypeptide has impaired transactivation activities. In addition, we show that truncated 219InsGPax9 protein is synthesized in mammalian cells but is mislocalized to the cytoplasm. Taken together, our data suggest that 219InsG is a loss-of-function mutation and that the 219InsGPAX9 gene product likely causes tooth agenesis via a haploinsufficiency mechanism. Our studies thus provide new molecular insights into the role of mutant PAX9 in causing tooth agenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe two mammalian expression vectors pRc-Pax9a and GAL4-Pax9a, encoding zebrafish Pax9a, are described elsewhere (9Nornes S.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5540-5544PubMed Google Scholar) are described previously.Primary Sequence Alignment and Structural Models—Alignment of sequences for the representative 128 amino acid residues of the paired domains of PAX6, PAX9, and the 219InsG PAX9 mutant was performed using the GeneStream ALIGN server, whereas the effect of the 219InsG mutation on the paired domain-DNA complex was examined using the existing model of the paired domain-DNA crystal structure of PAX6.Construction of GST-fused Expression Plasmids pGEX-Pax9 and pGEX-219InsGPax9—A 2.4-kb murine Pax9 cDNA clone (pSHlox-Pax9) comprising the full-length coding sequence and portions of both the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (GenBank™, accession number NM-035171) was kindly provided by Dr. Annette Neubüser (Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Wien, Austria). By using pSHlox-Pax9 construct as a template, recombination PCR was performed with primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the 1026-bp coding sequence of murine Pax9. The 5′-primer (5′-CCCCGGATCCATGGAGCCAGCCTTCGGGGAG-3′) also encodes a BamHI site (boldface), whereas the 3′-primer (5′-CCCCGTCGACTCAGAGTGCAGAAGCGGTCAC-3′) contained a termination codon (underlines) followed by a SalI site (boldface). To ensure high reaction fidelity, the PCR was performed with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, CA) using conditions described previously (5Peters H. Neubüser A. Kratochwil K. Balling R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2735-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR-amplified product encoding the full-length sequence (1-342 amino acids) was gel-purified with Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA). Recovered product was digested with BamHI and SalI and subcloned into the BamHI-SalI site of the expression vector pGEX 6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate pGEX-Pax9. Recombinant plasmids were identified by restriction analysis and then sequenced entirely using pGEX sequencing primers (Amersham Biosciences).To construct pGEX-219InsGPax9, in vitro site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 219InsG mutation was introduced into the wild type Pax9 cDNA using the pGEX-Pax9 as template and sense (219InsGPax9F, 5′-GGAGGCATCGGGGGGCAGCAAGCCCCG-3′) and antisense (219InsGPax9R: 5′-CGGGGCTTGCTGCCCCCCGATGCCTCC-3′) mutated primers to create a G insertion between nucleotides 219 and 220 within the paired domain of the full-coding sequence of Pax9 cDNA. The DpnI-digested PCR product was then transformed into DH5α-competent cells and plated on LB-Amp. The cDNA inserts of selected positive clones were sequenced entirely to ensure the absence of other mutations. A single clone bearing only the desired 219InsG mutation was chosen as the construct pGEX-219InsGPax9.Construction of Mammalian Expression Plasmids pCMV-Pax9 and pCMV-219InsGPax9—The following mammalian expression plasmids were constructed for use in co-transfection assays: pCMV-Pax9, pCMV-219InsGPax9. The full coding sequences of Pax9 cDNA and 219InsGPax9 cDNA (obtained from BamHI-SalI restriction digest) were each subcloned into the BamHI-SalI site of the mammalian expression vector pCMVscript (Stratagene) to generate the constructs pCMV-Pax9 and pCMV-219InsGPax9, respectively. A 2.0-μl aliquot of the ligation mixture was used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α cells, and recombinant plasmids were selected. Plasmids were sequenced using the CMV promoter-specific primer CMV-F (Stratagene) to confirm the orientation, framing, and sequence of the cDNA insert.Construction of GAL4 Fusion Expression Plasmids pm-Pax9 and pm-219InsGPax9—To maintain the correct reading frame, the full-length Pax9 cDNA and 219InsGPax9 cDNA were subcloned separately into EcoRI-PstI sites of the GAL4 expression vector pM (Stratagene) to generate pM-Pax9 and pM-219InsGPax9 constructs, respectively. Recombinant DNA sequences were verified by sequencing across the GAL4 junction using the GAL4-specific primer GAL4-BIND (Stratagene).Purification of GST-Pax9 and GST-219InsGPax9 Fusion Proteins—BL21 E. coli competent cells (Novagen, WI) were transformed with the recombinant plasmid of interest. A 5.0-ml overnight culture of the transformed BL21 cells was inoculated into 1 liter of LB broth containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. The bacterial culture was grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5, and the expression of recombinant protein was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after 3 h by centrifugation at 5000 × g. Affinity purification of GST fusion protein was performed on immobilized glutathione-Sepharose chromatographic column (Sigma) using a method described previously (12Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Purified GST fusion proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining on a 4% SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was estimated using the GST Tag Assay kit (Novagen, WI) and the manufacturer's instructions. The GST tag assay is sensitive to functionally active GST and was beneficial in assessing whether protein purification methods employed generated inactive or active GST-fused polypeptides. Use of the GST tag assay demonstrated that functionally active GST fusion proteins were produced prior to and after affinity purification.End Labeling of DNA Probe and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Oligonucleotides corresponding to e5 ((39-mer), sense, 5′-CACCGCACGATTAGCACCGTTCCGCTCAGGCTGTCCCCC-3′; antisense, 5-CACGGGACAGCCTGAGCGGAACGGTGCTAATCGTGCGGT-3′) and CD19-2(A-ins) ((23-mer), 5′-CGTGGTCACGCCTCAGTGCCCCA-3; antisense, 5′-CTGGGCACTGAGGCGTGACCAC-3′) were synthesized (Sigma-Genosys), and equimolar amounts of complementary strands of each were annealed to generate the double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. The double-stranded DNA were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase using a method described previously (4Neubüser A. Koseki H. Balling R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed using G-25 size exclusion Sephadex Quick Spin columns (Roche Applied Science), and a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 3801) was used to measure the amount of radioactivity (counts/min). Binding reactions were performed separately for wild type Pax9 and 219InsGPax9 using a previously described procedure (4Neubüser A. Koseki H. Balling R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Initially, radiolabeled e5 was incubated with 10 ng of affinity-purified GST-Pax9 and GST-219InsGPax9 proteins. By using the CD19-2(A-ins) probe, binding reactions were performed with increasing concentrations of both wild type and mutant polypeptides. In all cases, EMSA was performed as described previously (4Neubüser A. Koseki H. Balling R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and in triplicate.Immunolocalization of Wild Type Pax9 and Mutant 219InsGPax9 in Mammalian Cells—Expression plasmids containing the CMV promoter linked to Pax9 and 219InsGPax9 cDNA were constructed in pCMV-Tag2b (Stratagene, CA). The c-Myc epitope is in-frame with the N terminus of PAX9. COS7 and NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Six-well tissue culture plates and 1-well chamber slides were seeded with 2 × 105 cells/well, respectively, and grown to 70% confluency. Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and 1.5 μg of DNA/well in FBS supplemented DMEM according to the manufacturer's instructions.To demonstrate the in vivo expression of wild type and mutant Pax9 proteins, transfected cells were harvested at 24 and 48 h. The cell lysates were denatured by boiling in sample buffer, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted on nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mouse 9E10 monoclonal c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:100 dilution. After membrane washing, a second antibody coupled to peroxidase was added. Proteins were visualized with ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The concentration of each extract was measured by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and an equal amount of proteins was loaded.Subcellular localization of wild type and mutant Pax9 proteins was shown by immunolocalization studies at 24 h after transfection. Transfected cells were fixed and permeabilized with -10 °C methanol for 5 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the above-mentioned primary antibody at a 1:100 dilution, washed, and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to visualize c-Myc. Cells were examined with an Olympus BH-2 microscope.Electroporation and Transient Co-transfection—COS7 and NIH3T3 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Transient co-transfections in both cell lines were performed by electroporation. Briefly, 10 μg of total plasmid (6 μg of the appropriate expression plasmid, 3 μg of the reporter plasmid, and 1 μg of the β-galactosidase internal control plasmid pCMVsport (Promega)) was added to 1 × 105 cells in a total volume of 500 μl of the Opti-MEM I serum-free growth medium (Invitrogen). The samples were placed on ice for 10 min and electroporated at 200 mV on a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The electroporated mixture was allowed to stand on ice for about 5 min and then cultured in a 6-well tissue culture plate (Corning Glass) containing 5 ml of growth media. Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 48 h.Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assays—Cell extracts were prepared after 48 h of transfection and assayed for luciferase activity at room temperature using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using a β-galactosidase assay kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity was subsequently normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity. All co-transfection assays were performed a minimum of four times, and representative results are shown.RESULTSThe Effect of 219InsG Mutation on the Paired Domain and DNA Binding Activities of PAX9—Based on the prediction derived from a model of the solved crystal structure of the PAX6 paired domain-DNA complex (Fig. 1A), the sequence alignment showed significant changes in paired domain residues. This occurred downstream of the site of the guanine insertion and was predicted to produce structural alterations that can impact the DNA binding activities of the mutant protein product (Fig. 1B). Specifically, Lys-76 and Arg-78 that contact the phosphodiester bond to mediate significant minor groove interactions with the DNA backbone are altered by the 219InsG mutation (Fig. 1B). Thus, our initial experimental effort concentrated on the use of EMSA to compare the relative differences in DNA binding activities between the two proteins.In preparation for the EMSA, both wild type and the mutated cDNAs were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 2). To allow a direct comparison of the DNA binding activities of wild type Pax9 and mutant 219InsGPax9, equal amounts of each polypeptide (purified active full-length) were incubated initially with e5, the Drosophila even-skipped promoter derived from high affinity paired domain binding sites. The EMSA data show (Fig. 3) that wild type Pax9 binds to the e5 probe, whereas the 219InsGPax9 failed to bind to e5 under the in vitro conditions of our experiment.Fig. 2Purification of the wild type and the 219InsG variant of Pax9 expressed as a recombinant GST fusion protein in bacteria. Recombinant GST-fused Pax9 and 219InsGPax9 proteins were purified from bacterial supernatants using a glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. GST fusion protein products of the expected sizes were generated for Pax9 and 219InsGPax9. Recombinant proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 after electrophoretic separation on 4% SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3EMSA of e5 binding to wild type Pax9 and 219InsGPax9 mutant proteins. Approximately 10 ng each of affinity-purified GST-Pax9 and GST-219InsGPax9 proteins was added to 5 fmol of 32P-labeled e5 in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), and 5% glycerol. Protein-e5 complexes were allowed to form at room temperature for 30 min and then loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide (29:1) gels containing 1× TBE (90 mm Tris-HCl, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). Gels were electrophoresed at a 100 V in 1× TBE buffer, dried under vacuum, and visualized by autoradiography. Lane 1, free probe; lane 2, wild type Pax9-e5 complex; lane 3, loss of binding of 219InsGPax9 to the e5 probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined if 219InsGPax9 binds preferentially to different sequences of DNA by using the CD19-2(A-ins) probe as the DNA recognition sequence. EMSA was performed with increasing amounts of each protein. No detectable protein-DNA complex was formed between the mutant 219InsGPax9 protein and the CD19-2(A-ins) probe at any of the protein concentrations used. In contrast, Pax9 was observed to bind to CD19-2(A-ins) under identical conditions and at all tested protein concentrations (Fig. 4). The loss of DNA binding activities to the CD19-2(A-ins) exhibited by 219InsGPax9 is consistent with EMSA data obtained initially using the e5 sequence.Fig. 4Loss of binding of 219InsGPax9 to the CD19-2(A-ins) cognate paired domain binding site. Increasing amounts (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 ng) of GST-Pax9 (A) and GST-219InsGPax9 fusion protein (B) were used in an EMSA to bind to the high affinity paired domain binding site CD19-2(A-ins). No protein-DNA complex was observed for 219InsGPax9 mutant protein for any of the protein concentrations used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunolocalization of Wild Type Pax9 and Mutant 219InsGPax9 in Mammalian Cells—We performed Western blots and immunofluorescence analysis to determine whether COS7 and NIH3T3-transfected cells synthesize wild type Pax9 and mutant 219InsGPax9 proteins. Wild type as well as mutant 219InsGPax9 proteins were detected by Western blots in extracts from transiently transfected cells after 24 h, indicating similar expression of both proteins (Fig. 5A). Thus, both cell lines are able to synthesize the mutant protein. In addition, no differences in protein levels were observed after 48 h (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, to examine the subcellular distribution of wild type Pax9 and mutant 219InsGPax9 proteins, we performed immunofluorescence assays. As shown in Fig. 6 (A and C), wild type Pax9 protein predominantly showed nuclear localization in COS7 and NIH3T3 cells, whereas mutant 219InsGPax9 protein primarily displayed cytoplasmic localization in both cell lines (Fig. 6, B and D).Fig. 5Stability of mutant 219InsGPax9 protein. Expression of wild type Pax9 and mutant 219InsGPax9 proteins with a Myc epitope were verified by Western blots of cell extracts from transfected COS7 and NIH3T3 cells after 24 (A) and 48 h (B) with anti-c-Myc antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Subcellular distribution of wild type Pax9 and mutant 219InsGPax9. c-Myc-tagged proteins were expressed in COS7 (A and B) and NIH3T3 (C and D) cells and examined by immunofluorescence using anti-c-Myc antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Note the nuclear localization pattern of wild type Pax9 protein (A and C). In contrast the truncated Pax9 protein immunolocalized within the perinuclear and cytoplasmic regions where it appeared in clumps (B and D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Effect of 219InsG Mutation on Pax9 Transactivation Potential—To examine the differences in activation of transcription by Pax9 and 219InsGPax9, co-transfection assays were performed with increasing amounts of Pax9 and 219InsGPax9 expression vectors together with the CD19-TK-LUC reporter plasmid in which luciferase expression is controlled by three CD19-2(A-ins) cis-acting DNA elements upstream of the herpes simplex virus TK promoter. Our data indicate that in both cell lines (COS7 and NIH3T3), the wild type Pax9 protein produced the highest level of transactivation activity, which was assigned a value of 100. In contrast, the mutant 219InsGPax9 produced ∼13.5 (in COS7) and 10% (in NIH3T3) of the wild type activity (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Pax9 can directly activate the transcription of TK promoter through its selective ability to bind to specific DNA-binding sequences, CD19-2(A-ins), whereas 219InsG cannot do so under identical conditions.A, the CD19TKLUC reporter contains three paired domain binding sites CD19-2(A-ins) upstream of the TK promoter. B, the luciferase activity of the reporter constructs in COS7. C, induction of luciferase reporter in NIH3T3. All data are shown as mean and S.D. of three independent co-transfection experiments. Due to the large variability in fold induction, the transcriptional activation data are reported as the percent luciferase activity relative to the maximum induction observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Effect of 219InsG on GAL4-mediated Transactivation Domain—Given the loss of DNA binding activities and the transcriptional inactivity of 219InsGPax9, we examined whether the impaired transactivation of this mutant protein can be attributed partly to inherent structural defects in the C-terminal putative transactivation domain. To separate DNA binding activities from transactivation function, we fused the full-length wild type Pax9 cDNA and full-length 219InsGPax9 cDNA to the yeast heterologous GAL4-DNA binding domain and assayed both constructs for luciferase activity in COS7 and NIH3T3 using the GAL4-TK-LUC reporter. Generally, luciferase activities were relatively low compared with values obtained earlier from co-transfections using the reporter bearing the Pax-responsive element (CD19-TK-LUC). In both cell lines, the full-length Pax9 protein fused to GAL4-DNA binding domain stimulated maximal expression of the GAL4-responsive reporter GAL4-TK-LUC, whereas 219InsGPax9's activation of the reporter was the lowest, almost identical to the basal transactivation (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Differential transactivation of the GAL4-TK-LUC reporter by Pax9 a"
https://openalex.org/W2085303389,"Cohorts of marine taxa that originated during recoveries from mass extinctions were commonly more widespread spatially than those originating at other times. Coupled with the recognition of a correlation between the geographic ranges and temporal longevities of marine taxa, this observation predicts that recovery taxa were unusually long-lived geologically. We analyzed this possibility by assessing the longevities of marine genus cohorts that originated in successive substages throughout the Phanerozoic. Results confirm that several mass extinction recovery cohorts were significantly longer lived than other cohorts, but this effect was limited to the post-Paleozoic, suggesting differences in the dynamics of Paleozoic versus post-Paleozoic diversification."

In the present study, we have further explored the role of PKCμ in AA-stimulated adhesion. PKCμ activation site serines 738/742 and autophosphorylation site serine 910 are rapidly phosphorylated, and in vitro PKCμ kinase activity is enhanced in response to AA treatment. Inhibition of PKCμ activation blocks AA-stimulated adhesion. A phosphorylated, truncated species of PKCμ was detected in AA-treated cells.

Studies have shown that increased cellular adhesion to ECM proteins, such as collagen type IV, often increases metastatic potential (1Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Devita V.T. Hellman S.

Arachidonic acid (AA) and its precursor, linoleic acid, are common dietary n-6 cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that may be present in the extracellular microenvironment. Although there is controversy over the effects of fat in the human diet on the development of breast cancer, there is substantial evidence for an effect of cis-PUFAs in animal models of mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis (2Rose D.P. Connolly J.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1743-1747Google Scholar, 3Rose D.P. Connolly J.M. Liu X.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6557-6562Google Scholar, 4Cave W.T.

AA is also present in an esterified form in cell membrane phospholipids and can be liberated by the actions of phospholipases. Studies have shown that fatty acids or their metabolites can alter the adhesion of breast tumor and other cell lines to components of the ECM (7Johanning G.L. Lin T.Y. Nutr. Cancer. 1995; 24: 57-66Google Scholar, 8Jiang W.G. Hiscox S. Hallett M.B. Scott C. Horrobin D.F. Puntis M.C.A. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 744-752Google Scholar, 9Meterissian S.H. Forse R.A. Steele G.D. Thomas P. Cancer Lett. 1995; 89: 145-152Google Scholar). For example, we have shown previously (10Palmantier R. Roberts J.D. Glasgow W.C. Eling T. Olden K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2206-2212Google Scholar) that AA stimulates adhesion of metastatic human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-435 cells to collagen type IV and also to vitronectin and fibronectin. In our earlier studies, we have also shown that adhesion to collagen type IV requires α1β1 and α2β1 integrins and functional protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (11Palmantier R. George M.D. Akiyama S.K. Wolber F.M. Olden K. Roberts J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2445-2452Google Scholar, 12Paine E. Palmantier R. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Roberts J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11284-11290Google Scholar). AA stimulation of adhesion is associated with the translocation of PKCϵ and PKCμ from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction of cell lysates, indicative of enzyme activation (11Palmantier R. George M.D. Akiyama S.K. Wolber F.M. Olden K. Roberts J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2445-2452Google Scholar). PKCϵ and PKCμ belong to the calcium-independent, diacylglycerol-responsive novel PKC (nPKC) family (13Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Google Scholar). However, the lack of a typical pseudosubstrate domain and the addition of an amino-terminal hydrophobic region and large pleckstrin homology domain-containing region within the regulatory domain make PKCμ unique (14Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Google Scholar). In addition, the PKCμ consensus substrate site is quite different from that of other PKCs (15Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Google Scholar, 16Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Google Scholar). Members of the PKC family are regulated, in part, through phosphorylation events, including phosphorylation at an activation site (17Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Google Scholar). Activation of PKCμ requires phosphorylation at serines 738/742 (mouse homologue PKD serines 744/748) (16Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Google Scholar, 18Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Google Scholar). PKCμ can be activated through direct phosphorylation by PKCϵ or PKCη (19Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P. Pfizenmaier K.

Interestingly, it has been reported that PKCμ, but not PKCϵ, is present in prostate cancer cells in which linoleic acid acts as a pro-cancer agent (21Pandian S.S. Sneddon A.A. Bestwick C.S. McClinton S. Grant I. Wahle K.W. Heys S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 806-812Google Scholar). It has also been reported that activation of PKCϵ is necessary for muscle cell adhesion to fibronectin (22Disatnik M.H. Boutet S.C. Lee C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Rando T.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2151-2163Google Scholar). PKCμ has also been detected in complexes with cortactin and paxillin in β1 integrin-containing breast cancer cell invadopodia into ECM (23Bowden E.T. Barth M. Thomas D. Glazer R.I. Mueller S.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4440-4449Google Scholar). Members of the calpain family of calcium-dependent neutral proteases can activate conventional PKC (cPKC) family members (α, β, and γ) by limited proteolysis (24Kishimoto A. Kajikawa N. Shiota M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1156-1164Google Scholar, 25Kishimoto A. Mikawa K. Hashimoto K. Yasuda I. Tanaka S.-I. Tominaga M. Kuroda T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4088-4092Google Scholar). PKCϵ has also been shown to be proteolyzed by calpain in vitro (26Saido T.C. Mizuno K. Konno Y. Osada S. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 482-490Google Scholar). cPKCs are cleaved in the third variable region, releasing the kinase domain from the inhibitory pseudosubstrate domain (25Kishimoto A. Mikawa K. Hashimoto K. Yasuda I. Tanaka S.-I. Tominaga M. Kuroda T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4088-4092Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal proteins are also calpain substrates, and calpain has been found to co-localize with focal adhesions (27Glading A. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 46-54Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that calpain inhibition or overexpression affects cell adhesion and migration. However, the effects observed following manipulation of calpain activity appear to be cell type-specific. For example, treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells with calpain inhibitor results in increased adhesiveness, whereas calpain inhibition results in decreased adhesiveness of mast cells and appears to have no effect on adhesiveness of vascular smooth muscle cells (28Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Google Scholar, 29Forsythe P. Befus A.D. J.

Up-regulation of calpain protein expression or mRNA has been observed in metastatic prostate tumors and has been associated with lymph node metastases of malignant renal cell carcinomas (31Rios-Doria J.

Cancer. 1999; 84: 6-9Google Scholar). MAPK signaling pathways are activated by a wide variety of stimuli and regulate a plethora of cellular responses. We have reported that of the three MAP kinase subfamilies, the extra-cellular signal-responsive kinases (ERK), the c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK), and the p38 MAP kinases, only the p38 MAP kinase pathway is required for AA-stimulated adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells to collagen type IV (12Paine E. Palmantier R. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Roberts J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11284-11290Google Scholar). p38 is regulated by phosphorylation that increases upon exposure to AA. Concomitant with the AA-induced increase in p38 phosphorylation, there is an increase in the phosphorylation and activity of the downstream effector, MAPKAPK2, and phosphorylation of the MAPKAPK2 substrate, HSP27 (12Paine E. Palmantier R. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Roberts J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11284-11290Google Scholar). PKCμ has been shown to play a role in the regulation of both the ERK and JNK pathways, but no association has been made between PKCμ and the p38 pathway (19Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T.

In this study, we have examined the involvement of PKCμ in the AA-mediated enhancement of MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion to collagen type IV. We have also investigated the possible involvement of calpain in modulation of breast cancer cell adhesion and in proteolysis of PKCμ. Finally, because we previously found that multiple signaling pathways are required for the AA effect, we have begun to explore potential mechanisms of cross-talk between these pathways. Antibodies—PKD/PKCμ, phospho-PKD/PKCμ (Ser-744/748), phospho-PKD/PKCμ (Ser-916), HSP27 G31 monoclonal, and phospho-HSP27 (Ser-82) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-active p38 antibody was from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-SAPK2a/p38 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Reagents—Arachidonic acid was from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Collagen type IV and poly-d-lysine were from BD Biosciences. Gö6976, Gö6983, PD169316, SB202474, calpeptin, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk), BSA, calpain I (human erythrocyte), and calpain II (rat recombinant) were from Calbiochem. SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate was from Pierce. MDL-28170 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). 7-Amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin, t-Boc-Leu-Met (t-Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC), was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Syntide-2 was from Sigma.

[γ-32P]ATP was from ICN (Irvine, CA). pcDNA-PKCμ was from Dr. Franz-Josef Johannes (Institute of Cell Biology and Immunology, University of Stuttgart) (35Johannes F.J. Horn J. Link G. Haas E. Siemienski K. Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 47-54Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Preparation—The human mammary adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB-435 was obtained from Dr. Janet Price (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, and 2× minimal essential medium vitamin solution (Invitrogen). Subconfluent cells were harvested by a brief incubation with Versene (Invitrogen), washed twice with serum-free medium, and resuspended in serum-free medium at 3 × 105 cells/ml (adhesion assay) or 2 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were allowed to equilibrate in serum-free medium for 20 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Adhesion Assays—Adhesion assays were carried out essentially as described (10Palmantier R. Roberts J.D. Glasgow W.C. Eling T. Olden K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2206-2212Google Scholar). 96-Well tissue culture plates were pre-coated with collagen type IV, poly-d-lysine, or BSA. Wells were washed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 7.4 mm Na2HPO4), and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with BSA. Inhibitors were added to cells prepared as described above, and cells were incubated for an additional 30 min. AA (30 μm) or vehicle was added to the cells, and 100 μl of the cell suspension was added to each well. Cells were incubated for 45 min, and non-adherent cells were removed by washing with serum-free medium. Adherent cells were fixed with 6% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet. The dye in adherent cells was solubilized with 1% (w/v) SDS, and the absorbance at 595 nm was determined. After background binding to BSA was subtracted, results were standardized as a percentage of adhesion to poly-d-lysine. Western Blotting—AA (30 μm) or vehicle was added to cells prepared as described above, and cells were incubated for an additional 1 min to 2 h. Inhibitors were added to the cell suspension, and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min prior to the addition of AA. Cells were collected, washed with PBS, and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. Membranes were blocked in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, plus 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) with 5% (w/v) milk, incubated with primary antibody for 1 h to overnight, and incubated with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Immunoreactivity was detected using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate. Blots were stripped by incubation in 100 mm glycine, pH 2.9, for 30 min; they were subsequently rinsed with TBS-T, blocked, and probed. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were treated and lysed as above. PKCμ was isolated by immunoprecipitation with the PKD/PKCμ antibody (1:100 dilution) for 2 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer. Immune complexes were recovered using protein A-Sepharose. Kinase assays were performed essentially as described by Waldron et al. (36Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Google Scholar). Immune complexes were washed once with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Syntide-2 substrate peptide (5 μg), [γ-32P]ATP (0.4 μCi), and inhibitors, if applicable, were added in a final volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and stopped by addition of 100 μl of 75 mm H3PO4. Reactions (75 μl) were spotted on Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose, washed with 75 mm H3PO4, dried, and quantitated in a scintillation counter. Results were normalized to levels of PKCμ immunoprecipitated from each sample. Cell Fractionation—Cell fractionation was carried out as described previously (11Palmantier R. George M.D. Akiyama S.K. Wolber F.M. Olden K. Roberts J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2445-2452Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated as above and washed with PBS. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), sonicated with three 10-s pulses at 22.5 kHz, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and saved as the cytoplasmic fraction. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer plus 1% Triton X-100, sonicated again, and centrifuged. The supernatants were collected and used as the membrane fraction. PKCμ was examined by Western blotting using equal protein, as described above; loading equal protein resulted in a 2-fold difference in cell equivalents between the cytosolic and membrane fraction, with the greater number of cell equivalents in the membrane fraction. In Vivo Calpain Assay—Cells were harvested as above, resuspended in serum-free medium, and treated with inhibitors, as appropriate. Cells were incubated for 20 min with 10 μmt-Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC, a cell-permeable fluorogenic calpain substrate. Aliquots (200 μl) of cell suspension were loaded into wells of a 96-well plate, and fluorescence generated through calpain cleavage of t-Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC was analyzed using an Fmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with a 355 nm excitation filter and a 460 nm emission filter. In Vitro Calpain Assay—Cells were transfected with pcDNA-PKCμ (2 μg/60-mm dish) using FuGENE. After 48 h, cells were treated and lysed as above, and PKCμ was immunoprecipitated as above. Immune complexes were washed 3 times, with the final wash in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Calpain assays were performed essentially as described by Carragher et al. (37Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Google Scholar). Calpain I or calpain II (0.05 units) was added to immune complexes in calpain buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol; 40 μl final volume) in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Cleavage of PKCμ was analyzed by Western blot as described above. AA Promotes Activation of PKCμ in MDA-MB-435 Cells— Subsequent to PKCμ/PKD cloning, many aspects of PKCμ biochemistry have been elucidated, but less has been ascertained about its biological functions. One characteristic of PKCμ is that activation requires phosphorylation at serines 738/742. To investigate the role of PKCμ activation in AA-mediated adhesion, we used an antibody specific for serine 738/742 phosphorylation. With this antibody, we detect multiple species of PKCμ, the origins of which are described below. Treatment of MDA-MB-435 cells with AA led to a rapid increase in serine 738/742 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Within 1 min of exposure to AA, phosphorylation of PKCμ increased, and PKCμ phosphorylation was stable for approximately 1 h. AA did not induce a change in the levels of total PKCμ protein during this time course (Fig. 1, A and B). The activation site serines 738/742 are predominantly transphosphorylated, in this instance probably by PKCϵ (36Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Google Scholar). However, PKCμ contains additional phosphorylation sites, including an autophosphorylation site at serine 910 (PKD serine 916) (38Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Google Scholar, 39Vertommen D. Rider M. Ni Y. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Van Lint J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19567-19576Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at serine 910 has been correlated with and used as a marker for PKCμ activity (38Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Google Scholar, 40Guha S. Rey O. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1632-1640Google Scholar, 41Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40298-40305Google Scholar). A serine 910 phosphorylation-specific antibody revealed AA-induced autophosphorylation of PKCμ that is stimulated as rapidly as activation site phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). To further establish AA as a modulator of PKCμ activity, we examined the activity of PKCμ purified from MDA-MB-435 cells. PKCμ from AA-stimulated cells showed an increase in in vitro kinase activity within 2 min of AA treatment. The enhancement of activity peaked at an average of 207% of the activity of PKCμ from vehicle-treated cells at ∼5 min and extended to at least 10 min. In addition, treatment with higher concentrations of AA led to further stimulation of PKCμ (data not shown). These results, along with the translocation of PKCμ, support the conclusion that AA activates PKCμ. Effect of PKCμ Inhibitors on AA-mediated Adhesion to Collagen Type IV—PKC inhibitors Gö6976 and Gö6983 inhibit the activity of PKCμ in vitro at vastly different concentrations. Gö6976 inhibits recombinant PKCμ from baculovirus-infected cells in the nanomolar range, whereas Gö6983 inhibits PKCμ in the micromolar range; similar concentrations inhibit in vitro activity of PKCμ purified from MDA-MD-435 cells (42Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller H.J. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Google Scholar) (data not shown). The capacity of these inhibitors to block PKCμ activity in MDA-MB-435 cells was examined by treating the cells with inhibitor and then stimulating with AA. The results in Fig. 2 demonstrate that both inhibitors block PKCμ activity, as measured by autophosphorylation. These inhibitors did not affect levels of total PKCμ protein (see Fig. 7B). Subsequently, we examined the abilities of Gö6976 and Gö6983 to alter AA-stimulated adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells to collagen type IV. Cells were incubated with inhibitor for 30 min prior to treatment with AA and plating on collagen type IV. Both inhibitors blocked the AA-mediated increase in adhesion (Fig. 3). A significant decrease in the response to AA was obtained with 20 nm Gö6976, and nearly complete inhibition was seen at 80 nm. Similar levels of inhibition of adhesion required 10–20 μm Gö6983. The inhibitor solvent (Me2SO) did not decrease the AA-stimulated adhesion (data not shown).Fig. 7Activation of PKCμ and p38 are independent events. Cells were pretreated with PKCμ inhibitor Gö6976 (160 nm) or Gö6983 (20 μm), p38 inhibitor PD169316 (10 μm), non-functioning p38 inhibitor analogue SB202474 (10 μm), or vehicle (DMSO) for 30 min prior to exposure to AA. Pretreated or control (–) cells were incubated with 30 μm AA (2nd to 7th lanes) or vehicle (1st lane, EtOH) for 5 min. Proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. A, blot was divided and probed with an active (phosphorylated) p38 antibody and with a phospho-HSP27 antibody. The blots were then stripped and probed for total p38 or total HSP27. B, blot was probed with autophosphorylation-specific PKCμ antibody. The blot was then stripped and probed for total PKCμ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3PKCμ inhibition prevents the AA-mediated enhancement of MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion to collagen type IV. Cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of PKC inhibitor Gö6976 (A) or Gö6983 (B) for 30 min prior to exposure to 30 μm AA or vehicle (EtOH) and analysis for adhesion to collagen type IV.

Given previous reports of calpain proteolysis of cPKC isoforms and PKCϵ and the stability of this form of PKCμ (Fig. 1A), we examined the hypothesis that the truncated PKCμ is generated through limited proteolysis by calpain (24Kishimoto A. Kajikawa N. Shiota M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1156-1164Google Scholar, 25Kishimoto A. Mikawa K. Hashimoto K. Yasuda I. Tanaka S.-I. Tominaga M. Kuroda T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol.

MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with a cell-permeable calpain inhibitor, either calpeptin (Fig. 4) or MDL-28170 (Fig. 5), prior to AA exposure. In the absence of calpain inhibitor, a 77-kDa activation site phosphorylated protein was detected, and the amount of phosphorylated protein significantly increased upon addition of AA (Fig. 4). In the presence of calpain inhibitor, the full-length, phosphorylated protein was detected, and AA treatment increased the levels of phosphorylated, full-length PKCμ. Concomitant with the increase in full-length, phosphorylated protein observed when AA-treated cells were pretreated with calpain inhibitor, there was a decrease in the level of proteolyzed, phosphorylated PKCμ, indicating that the truncated protein was produced via calpain cleavage of the full-length protein (Fig. 4).Fig. 5Inhibition of calpain activity leads to retention of activated, full-length PKCμ in the cell membrane. MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with calpain inhibitor MDL-28170 (300 μm) for 30 min prior to AA exposure or untreated (–). Cells were treated with 30 μm AA for 2 min or 10 min and then separated into cytosolic (C) and membrane (M) fractions. Proteins (50"

These red cells lack either both GPA and glycophorin B (GPB) (MkMk cells) or GPA (En(a–) cells) or contain a hybrid of GPA and GPB (MiV cells). Sulfate transport was reduced in all three red cell types to ∼60% of that in normal control red cells as a result of an increased apparent Km for sulfate. Transport of the monovalent anions iodide and chloride was also reduced. The reduced iodide transport resulted from a reduction in the Vmax for iodide transport. The anion transport site was investigated by measuring iodide fluorescence quenching of eosin-5-maleimide (EMA)-labeled band 3. The GPA-deficient cells had a normal Kd for iodide binding, in agreement with the unchanged Km found in transport studies. However, the apparent diffusion quenching constant (Kq) was increased, and the fluorescence polarization of band 3-bound EMA decreased in the variant cells, suggesting increased flexibility of the protein in the region of the EMA-binding site. This increased flexibility is probably associated with the decrease in Vmax observed for iodide transport. Our results suggest that band 3 in the red cell can take up two different structures: one with high anion transport activity when GPA is present and one with lower anion transport activity when GPA is absent.

Reduction of the amount of band 3 in the human red cell membrane results in membrane defects, and the almost total absence of band 3 in man compromises life and requires intervention (13.Ribeiro M.L.

However, GPA can be reduced or even absent as a result of genetic defects without known clinical consequences (15.Cartron J.P. Rahuel C. Trans. Med. Rev. 1992; 6: 63-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In some individuals, GPA is completely absent in the red cell membrane (En(a–) cells), whereas other individuals have red cells that lack both GPA and glycophorin B (GPB) (MkMk cells). In other cases, only GPB is absent in the red cell membrane (S–s–U– cells). The GPA and GPB genes are located in tandem on chromosome 4, and these two highly homologous genes are prone to deletions, gene conversions, and crossovers. The structure and function of band 3 are altered in En(a–) red cells (16.Gahmberg C.G. Myllyla G. Leikola J. Pirkola A. Nordling S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6108-6116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Tanner M.J.A. Jenkins R.E. Anstee D.J. Clamp J.R. Biochem.

In these cells, band 3 has a higher apparent molecular weight due to an increase in the size of the N-glycan chain (16.Gahmberg C.G. Myllyla G. Leikola J. Pirkola A. Nordling S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6108-6116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Tanner M.J.A. Jenkins R.E. Anstee D.J. Clamp J.R. Biochem.

In MkMk cells, the sulfate transport activity of band 3 is ∼60% of that in normal red cells as a result of an increase in the apparent Km for sulfate (20.Bruce L.J. Groves J.D. Okubo Y. Thilanganathan B. Tanner M.J.A. Blood. 1994; 84: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been argued that this altered transport activity is due to the lack of GPA in MkMk cells, as there is no evidence for an interaction between band 3 and GPB. The transport domain of band 3 has been studied by the fluorescence quenching of eosin-5-maleimide (EMA)-labeled band 3 with I– (21.Pan R.-J. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4880-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It was found that the Stern-Volmer plot of the quenching reaction between EMA-labeled band 3 and I– exhibits a downward curvature. Moreover, the quenching is inhibited by the specific inhibitor 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and transportable anions. The quenching data were quantitatively analyzed by a binding-diffusion model. The model supposes that, when covalently bound to Lys430 of band 3, EMA is located in a pocket in band 3, which is probably the anion access channel (22.Cobb C.E. Beth A.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8283-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Based on the binding-diffusion quenching model, two parameters are obtained, viz. the anion dissociation constant (Kd) and the apparent diffusion quenching constant (Kq). These two parameters are likely to be related to the structure and dynamic features of the transport domain. This study compares the structure and function of band 3 in red cells that entirely lack GPA (En(a–) and MkMk cells), that lack part of the GPA molecule (MiV cells), or that lack GPB (S–s–U– cells). We show that sulfate transport activity in En(a–) and MiV cells was reduced to the same extent (50–60% of that in normal red cells) as previously reported for MkMk cells (20.Bruce L.J. Groves J.D. Okubo Y. Thilanganathan B. Tanner M.J.A. Blood. 1994; 84: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the sulfate transport activity of band 3 in S–s–U– red cells was normal. The reduced sulfate transport activity in MkMk, En(a–), and MiV red cells resulted from a reduction in the apparent affinity of sulfate binding to band 3 (apparent Km). We also measured monovalent anion transport and show that chloride transport activity in En(a–) cells was reduced to ∼40% of that in normal red cells. The iodide transport activities of band 3 in MkMk, En(a–), and MiV red cells were reduced, but this reduction was due to a decrease in the maximum velocity of iodide transport (apparent Vmax). Fluorescence quenching experiments with EMA-labeled band 3 showed that the Kd values for I– and HCO3- binding to band 3 in these variant red cells were almost the same as those in normal red cells, but the Kq values were significantly increased in En(a–), MkMk, and MiV red cells. The fluorescence polarization of band 3-bound EMA was decreased in the GPA variant cells. The results suggest that, when GPA is absent, there is increased flexibility of the membrane domain of band 3 that is associated with the reduced anion transport activity of the molecule. Our observations indicate that band 3 in the red cell can take up two different structures: one with high anion transport activity when GPA is present and one with lower anion transport activity when GPA is absent. Materials—The MkMk blood sample was obtained from the Osaka Red Cross Blood Center (Osaka, Japan). The homozygous En(a–) and MiV(Japan (Jp)) blood samples were obtained from the Japanese Red Cross Central Blood Center (Tokyo, Japan). The homozygous MiV(Norway (No)) and S–s–U– blood samples were obtained from the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory (Bristol, United Kingdom). The MiV cells contain a hybrid glycophorin composed of residues 1–58 of GPA and residues 27–72 of GPB (23.Vengelen-Tyler V. Anstee D.J. Issitt P.D. Pavone B.G. Ferguson S.J. Mawby W.J. Tanner M.J.A. Blajchman M.A. Lorque P. Transfusion (Bethesda). 1981; 21: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Normal control blood samples were either drawn and shipped under the same conditions as for the GPA variant samples or were age-matched samples obtained from the Blood Transfusion Centre (Bristol). Monoclonal antibodies R1.3 and BRIC 170 were from Professor D. J. Anstee (Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, Bristol). Analysis of Red Cell Membrane Proteins—En(a–), MiV(Jp), and control red cells (1 μl of packed cells) were solubilized with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 6.25 mm EDTA, 0.0625% SDS, 1.25% C12E8 (octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether), 4 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml antipain and treated with or without 40 units of peptide N-glycanase F at 37 °C for 17 h. Untreated red cell ghosts were also prepared for each red cell type. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted according to the methods of Wainwright et al. (24.Wainwright S.D. Tanner M.J.A. Martin G.E.M. Yendle J.E. Holmes C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Anion Transport Assays—A time course for sulfate transport at 30 °C was done over 60 min and found to be linear for the first 15 min. A time course for iodide transport at 8 °C was done over 15 min and found to be linear for the first 7 min. All transport measurements were performed within the linear range of the assay. The [35S]sulfate influx into red cells was measured using variant and control cells at 10% hematocrit, and the number of DIDS-binding sites was determined by titration of sulfate transport as described previously (25.Schofield A.E. Reardon D.M. Tanner M.J.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The Vmax and apparent Km for [35S]sulfate influx were calculated from sulfate influx measurements in the absence of DIDS using sulfate concentrations between 0.4 and 50 mm. The Vmax and apparent Km for [125I]iodide influx were calculated from iodide influx measurements in the absence of DIDS using iodide concentrations between 0.4 and 60 mm. Red cell [36Cl]chloride efflux was measured as described by Gunn and Frohlich (26.Gunn R.B. Frohlich O. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 54-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Labeling of Band 3 with EMA—EMA-labeled red cell membranes were prepared according to Nigg and Cherry (27.Nigg E.A. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3457-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, blood samples were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (5 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8) at 4 °C and then two times with buffer A (90 mm Na2HPO4 and 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5). The washed red cells (70% hematocrit in buffer A) were incubated with EMA (1 mg of EMA/5 ml of packed red cells) in the dark at the room temperature for 45 min. To stop the labeling reaction and to remove excess free EMA, the labeled red cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline several times until the supernatant was clear. EMA-labeled ghosts were prepared, and the samples were flushed with nitrogen and stored in the dark at 4 °C. The subsequent fluorescence quenching measurements were carried out within 2 days after preparation of the membranes. Fluorescence Spectroscopic Measurements and Data Analysis—The fluorescence quenching measurements were performed as described previously (21.Pan R.-J. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4880-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities were determined on a Shimadzu RF500PC spectrofluorometer. Eosin was excited at 510 nm, and the emission was recorded at 547 nm with excitation and emission slits adjusted to 2.5 nm. The eosin concentration was generally ∼10–7m. Freshly prepared KI (4 m) stock solution contained 3 mm Na2S2O3 to prevent formation of I3-. For each quencher concentration, the ghosts were suspended in buffer B (5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.8) containing an amount of trisodium citrate such that, after addition of different amounts of I–, the ionic strength remained constant at 250 mm. Fluorescence intensities were corrected for the small dilution factor (<5%) arising from the addition of the quencher stock solution. The fluorescence quenching data were analyzed by the binding-diffusion model (21.Pan R.-J. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4880-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Equation 1), F0/F-1=Kq[I-]/(Kd(1+Kq)+[I-])(Eq. 1) where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quenchers, respectively; Kq is the apparent diffusion quenching constant; and Kd is the dissociation constant for I– binding to the anion-binding site on band 3. Rearrangement of Equation 1 gives Equation 2, F/(F0-F)=Kd(1+1/Kq)/[I-]+1/Kq(Eq. 2) and hence, the values of Kq and Kd can be determined from the slope and y intercept of plots of F/(F0 – F) against 1/[I–]. When the quenching titration is performed in the presence of the other band 3 substrate anion (HCO3-), the apparent dissociation constant (Kd′) for I– binding (21.Pan R.-J. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4880-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) is as shown in Equation 3, Kd'=([HCO3-]/Kd(a)+1)Kd(Eq. 3) where Kd(a) is the dissociation constant for HCO3-. Thus, a plot of Kd′ against [HCO3-] is linear, and Kd(a) can be determined from the slope. The fluorescence polarization (p) was determined for band 3-bound EMA by Equation 4, p=(Ivv-GIvh)/(Ivv+GIvh)(Eq. 4) where Ivv is the fluorescence intensity when the excitation polarizer is vertical and the emission polarizer is vertical, and Ivh is the fluorescence intensity when the excitation polarizer is vertical and the emission polarizer is horizontal. The polarization factor of the emission monochromator (G) is given by G = Ihv/Ihh. GPA and GPB in Variant and Control Red Cells—Red cell membrane proteins (separated by SDS-PAGE) were immunoblotted using monoclonal antibody R1.3 to confirm that the variant red cells contained the expected profiles of GPA and GPB (reviewed by Anstee (28.Anstee D.J. Semin. Hematol. 1981; 18: 13-31PubMed Google Scholar)). Monoclonal antibody R1.3 reacts more strongly with GPB than with GPA (29.Gardner B. Parsons S.F. Merry A.H. Anstee D.J. Immunology. 1989; 68: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar). Both GPA and GPB were detected in control red cell membranes in their monomeric, dimeric, and heterodimeric forms (Fig. 1a). En(a–) red cell membranes lacked GPA and contained only the GPB forms (monomers, dimers, and trimers) (Fig. 1a). Immunoblotting of MiV(No) and MiV(Jp) red cell membranes with monoclonal antibody R1.3 did not show any of the normal GPA or GPB bands (Fig. 1a), but detected the monomeric and dimeric forms of the MiV GPA/GPB hybrid protein (23.Vengelen-Tyler V. Anstee D.J. Issitt P.D. Pavone B.G. Ferguson S.J. Mawby W.J. Tanner M.J.A. Blajchman M.A. Lorque P. Transfusion (Bethesda). 1981; 21: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The Size of the N-Glycan Chain of Band 3 Is Increased in En(a–) and MiV Red Cells—It has been shown previously that band 3 in En(a–) and MiV red cells has a higher apparent molecular weight (16.Gahmberg C.G. Myllyla G. Leikola J. Pirkola A. Nordling S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6108-6116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Tanner M.J.A. Jenkins R.E. Anstee D.J. Clamp J.R. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23.Vengelen-Tyler V. Anstee D.J. Issitt P.D. Pavone B.G. Ferguson S.J. Mawby W.J. Tanner M.J.A. Blajchman M.A. Lorque P. Transfusion (Bethesda). 1981; 21: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and that, in En(a–) red cells, this is due to an increase in the size of the N-glycan chain (16.Gahmberg C.G. Myllyla G. Leikola J. Pirkola A. Nordling S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6108-6116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Tanner M.J.A. Jenkins R.E. Anstee D.J. Clamp J.R. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We showed that the increased apparent molecular weight of band 3 in MiV red cells is also due to an increase in the size of the N-glycan chain. MiV, En(a–), and control red cells treated with or without peptide N-glycanase F and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE were immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody reactive with the N terminus of band 3 (BRIC 170). In the untreated samples, band 3 in both MiV and En(a–) red cells had a higher apparent molecular weight compared with band 3 in control red cells (Fig. 1b). However, band 3 had the same mobility in all the samples after treatment of the red cells with peptide N-glycanase F (Fig. 1b), showing that the increased apparent molecular weight of band 3 in both MiV and En(a–) red cells is due to an increase in the size of the associated N-glycan chain. En(a–) and MiV Red Cells Have an Increased Apparent Km for Sulfate, Resulting in Reduced Divalent Anion Transport— The divalent anion transport activities in En(a–), MiV(Jp), MiV(No), S–s–U–, and control red cells were compared by titration of the sulfate influx with DIDS. The results show that sulfate transport activity in En(a–) and MiV red cells was ∼55% of that in control cells, whereas the total number of reversible and irreversible DIDS-binding sites was the same in all three cell types (Fig. 2, a and b; and Table I). The latter observation shows that all the variant cells contained the same number of band 3 molecules/cell compared with normal control cells. The sulfate transport activity of S–s–U– red cells was unchanged compared with two control blood samples (Fig. 2c).Table ISummary of the anion transport dataSampleSulfate transport activityNo. DIDS-binding sitesSulfateIodideKmVmaxKmVmaxMkMk61 ± 1aPreviously published by Bruce et al.

Open table in a new tab The Vmax and apparent Km for sulfate influx were calculated for MkMk, En(a–), MiV(No), and control red cells from sulfate influx measurements over a range of sulfate concentrations. The Vmax for sulfate influx into each type of GPA-deficient red cell was similar to that into control cells, but the apparent Km for sulfate influx into the GPA-deficient red cells was increased (Fig. 3 and Table I). The apparent Km for sulfate influx into MkMk red cells was 185%, and 170% of that into control cells (Fig. 3a and Table I). In En(a–) red cells, the apparent Km for sulfate was 160%, and 160% of that in control cells (Fig. 3b and Table I); and in MiV(No) red cells, the apparent Km for sulfate was 160% of that in control cells (Fig. 3c and Table I). MkMk, En(a–), and MiV Red Cells Have a Decreased Vmax for Monovalent Anions, Resulting in Reduced Monovalent Anion Transport—The monovalent anion transport activities of En(a–), MkMk, MiV(Jp), and control red cells were compared by measuring [125I]iodide influx into and [36Cl]chloride efflux out of the cells. [125I]Iodide influx was measured in En(a–), MkMk, MiV(Jp), and control red cells, and the Vmax and apparent Km for [125I]iodide influx were calculated from these measurements. The apparent Km for iodide in the En(a–), MkMk, and MiV(Jp) red cells was similar to that in control cells; however, the Vmax for iodide influx was reduced (Fig. 4, a and b; and Table I). The Vmax for iodide influx into En(a–), MkMk, and MiV(Jp) cells was 64, 58 ± 6, and 61%, respectively, of that into control cells (Fig. 4, a and b; and Table I). It was possible to measure [36Cl]chloride efflux only for the En(a–) red cells because of the difficulty of access to the other rare blood samples. En(a–) cells were found to have only 40% of the chloride efflux transport activity of normal control red cells (Fig. 4c). GPA-deficient Red Cells Show Enhanced Fluorescence Quenching Efficiencies for Band 3-bound EMA Due to an Increased Kq—Stern-Volmer plots of quenching of EMA-band 3 fluorescence in both normal and GPA-deficient red cell membranes exhibited a downward curvature similar to that previously reported (21.Pan R.-J. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4880-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Values of Kd and Kq were obtained from linear plots of F/(F0 – F) against 1/[I–] (Equation 2). Fig. 5 shows that, compared with control red cells, En(a–), MkMk, and MiV(Jp) samples have reduced intercept values on the axis of F/(F0 – F), which indicates that the Kq for each GPA variant is increased. However, the Kd values for I– binding to band 3 were found to be the same for normal and GPA-deficient red cells. The values of Kq and Kd for normal and GPA-deficient red cells are listed in Table II.Table IISummary of the binding-diffusion quenching parameters for GPA variant red cell membranesRed cellsKqKdI-HCO3-mmControl0.39 ± 0.0259 ± 441 ± 3En(a-)0.52 ± 0.0157 ± 242 ± 3MkMk0.55 ± 0.0360 ± 544 ± 4MiV0.50 ± 0.0357 ± 441 ± 4 Open table in a new tab Competitive inhibition experiments of the I– quenching reaction with HCO3- were also performed. The data were analyzed as described by Pan and Cherry (21.Pan R.-J. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4880-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) by determining the Kd′ for I– binding in the presence of different concentrations of HCO3-. A plot of Kd′ against [HCO3-] then yields the dissociation constant for HCO3-. The values thus obtained showed no differences in normal, En(a–), MkMk, and MiV red cell membranes (Table II). This further confirms that the increased quenching efficiencies observed in En(a–), MkMk, and MiV red cell membranes are caused only by an increase in Kq. Because the fluorescence lifetime of band 3-bound EMA is ∼10–9 s (30.Macara I.G. Kuo S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1785-1792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the I– ion must reach the fluorophore within this time interval for quenching to occur. In the binding-diffusion model, a mechanism whereby a bound I– ion dissociates and diffuses to the probe would require a very high off-rate constant, in the order of 109 s–1. Therefore, we have previously argued that bound I– collides with the probe as a result of flexing motions of the band 3 protein (21.Pan R.-J. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4880-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, Kq can be regarded as an indication of the local flexibility in the region of the band 3-bound EMA site and I–-binding site. Fluorescence Polarization Measurements Show Enhanced Flexibility of the Anion Transport Domain in GPA-deficient Membranes—The results of fluorescence polarization experiments for EMA-labeled normal and GPA-deficient red cell membranes are shown in Fig. 6. Whereas the fluorescence polarization value for normal cell membranes was 0.37 ± 0.02, the polarization values for En(a–), MkMk, and MiV cell membranes were 0.29 ± 0.01, 0.27 ± 0.03, and 0.30 ± 0.02, respectively. The decreased fluorescence polarization values indicate more local flexibility of band 3 in red cell membranes lacking GPA compared with normal membranes. These results are consistent with the increased Kq values obtained for the GPA-deficient red cell membranes (Fig. 5 and Table II). There is evidence to suggest that GPA plays a role in both the biosynthesis and folding of band 3 in the red blood cell (20.Bruce L.J. Groves J.D. Okubo Y. Thilanganathan B. Tanner M.J.A. Blood. 1994; 84: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that GPA facilitates the movement of band 3 to the cell surface, suggesting that it may have a chaperone-like role in enhancing trafficking through internal compartments during band 3 biosynthesis (3.Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Membr.

Investig. 1998; 102: 2173-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This effect has been shown not to require the GPA dimer because the GPA monomers also enhance band 3 anion transport in Xenopus oocytes (10.Young M.T. Beckmann R. Toye A.M. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Other studies have indicated that these two proteins can interact in the mature red cell (1.Nigg E.A. Bron C. Girardet M. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1887-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2.Telen M.J. Chasis J.A. Blood. 1990; 76: 842-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ring S.M. Tippett P. Swallow D.A. Vox.

Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J.A. Gratzer W.B. Blood. 86. J.M. J. A., 1995: 342-348MGoogle Scholar). The relationship between band 3 and GPA appears to be a reciprocal one because GPA in band 3–/– mice does not reach the red cell membrane despite the presence of normal amounts of GPA mRNA (32.Hassoun H. Hanada T. Lutchman M. Sahr K.E. Palek J. Hanspal M. Chishti A.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 2146-2151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, plasma membrane expression of GPA is increased by the coexpression of band 3 in the K562 cell line (10.Young M.T. Beckmann R. Toye A.M. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Two sites on GPA involved in interactions with band 3 have recently been defined by expression studies in Xenopus oocytes (12.Young M.T. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32954-32961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, a known site of interaction between band 3 and GPA in mature red cells results in the formation of the Wrb blood group antigen. Expression of the Wrb antigen involves Glu658 of band 3 and residues 58–70 of GPA (7.Bruce L.J. Ring S.M. Anstee D.J. Reid M.E. Wilkinson S. Tanner M.J.A. Blood. 1995; 85: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glu658 is at the extracellular side of putative transmembrane span 8 of band 3, suggesting that GPA interacts close to span 8 of band 3. Other evidence has shown that GPA enhances the surface movement of C-terminal (but not N-terminal) fragments of band 3 (33.Wang L. Groves J.D. Mawby W.J. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10631-10638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The minimum fragment of band 3 on which GPA acts to enhance band 3 surface presentation is the portion encompassing putative transmembrane spans 9–12 (33.Wang L. Groves J.D. Mawby W.J. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10631-10638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In a previous study of band 3 in MkMk red cells (which lack both GPA and GPB), we suggested that the increased size of the N-glycan chain on band 3 and the reduced sulfate transport activity in these cells result from the absence of GPA rather than GPB (20.Bruce L.J. Groves J.D. Okubo Y. Thilanganathan B. Tanner M.J.A. Blood. 1994; 84: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates similar changes in anion transport in En(a–) red cells, but not in S–s–U– red cells. This confirms that it is the absence of GPA (and not GPB) that affects the function of band 3. En(a–) cells also show an increase in the size of the N-glycan chain as reported previously (16.Gahmberg C.G. Myllyla G. Leikola J. Pirkola A. Nordling S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6108-6116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Tanner M.J.A. Jenkins R.E. Anstee D.J. Clamp J.R. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These same anion transport and N-glycan size changes are found in band 3 in MiV cells, indicating that the site of interaction between band 3 and GPA is in the GPA region comprising residue 59 to the C terminus, consistent with other observations (12.Young M.T. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32954-32961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that both sulfate and iodide transport are reduced in MkMk, En(a–), and MiV red cells and that chloride transport is reduced in En(a–) red cells, although all these red cells contain the same number of band 3 molecules as normal red cells. The absence of GPA clearly results in a structural change that alters the specific activity of the anion transport site of band 3. Although the GPA-deficient red cells have larger band 3 N-glycan chains, this is unlikely to be the cause of the change in the specific anion transport activity of band 3 because it is known that deglycosylation of band 3 has no effect on the rate of anion transport (34.Casey J.R. Pirraglia C.A. Reithmeier R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11940-11948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the affinity of the protein for stilbene disulfonates (35.Oikawa K. Lieberman D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2843-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our data shows that band 3 can exist in two states: a high activity conformation when GPA is present and a lower activity conformation when GPA is absent. The change in band 3 conformation affects anion binding and anion translocation. Interestingly, the nature of the reduced anion transport in the absence of GPA differed between the monovalent and divalent anions. The reduced sulfate transport resulted from a reduction in the apparent affinity of band 3 for this divalent anion (increased apparent Km), and the reduced iodide transport resulted from a decrease in the maximum rate of transport for this monovalent anion (reduced Vmax). GPA-deficient cells also showed reduced efflux transport of chloride, a physiological substrate for band 3. Fluorescence quenching of the probe EMA provides an alternative method of investigating the transport domain of band 3. The finding that the Kd for I– and for another monovalent anion (HCO3-) is unchanged in the GPA-deficient red cells is consistent with the unchanged Km for iodide transport. The quenching experiments reveal, however, that there is a change in the transport domain of band 3 in the GPA-deficient red cells that results in an increase in Kq. This parameter has been interpreted as reflecting local flexibility of band 3. To test this proposal, we measured fluorescence polarization of the EMA probe and found it to be decreased in the GPA-deficient cell membranes (Fig. 6). A decrease in fluorescence polarization is evidence for an increase in the wobbling motion of the probe in its binding site. Thus, both the fluorescence quenching and fluorescence polarization experiments indicate that there is more local motion in the transport domain of band 3 in the GPA-deficient cells compared with normal cells. It is reasonable to suppose that the same structural change is responsible for both the increase in local flexibility and the decrease in Vmax for monovalent anion transport, although the precise relationship between these two effects is unclear. Although EMA is an inhibitor of anion transport, the present experiments demonstrate that the fluorescence properties of the bound probe can reflect subtle structural changes that influence anion transport activity. At present, it unclear whether the altered structure and increased flexibility of band 3 result from changes in the folding of band 3 that are mediated directly or indirectly by GPA during band 3 biosynthesis or result from GPA changing the structure of mature band 3 in the red cell membrane. In earlier studies of band 3 in normal red cells, we found that sulfate was not able to inhibit I– quenching of EMA-labeled band 3. 2R. J. Cherry, unpublished data. This has prevented the application of the quenching assay for the measurement of divalent anion binding affinity. This is probably due to the different ways in which band 3 interacts with monovalent and divalent substrate anions and suggests that the structures of the monovalent and divalent anion-binding sites also differ in band 3 in normal cells. Divalent anion transport occurs by a proton-anion cotransport mechanism (36.Milanick M.A. Gunn R.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 79: 87-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and also has other characteristics that differ significantly from monovalent anion transport (reviewed by Passow (37.Passow H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 103: 61-223PubMed Google Scholar)). It has been shown previously that coexpression of GPA with band 3 enhances band 3-mediated chloride transport induced in Xenopus oocytes and that increased movement of band 3 to the oocyte cell surface is at least partly responsible for this effect (3.Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study showed that two separate effects of GPA are responsible for increasing band 3-mediated transport in Xenopus oocytes: an increase in the amount of band 3 moved to the oocyte cell surface and an increase in the intrinsic anion transport activity of the protein (12.Young M.T. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32954-32961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These two effects are mediated by different regions of the GPA molecule (12.Young M.T. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32954-32961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Analysis of the effects of GPA or GPB mutants on band 3 expression (including naturally occurring GPA/GPB hybrid molecules like MiV) showed that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of GPA enhances trafficking of band 3 to the cell surface, whereas extracellular GPA residues 68–70 increase the specific chloride transport activity of band 3. Deletion of Phe68–Glu70 of GPA reduces the enhancement by GPA of band 3 chloride transport by 80% when the two proteins are coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes without affecting the amount of band 3 expressed at the cell surface (12.Young M.T. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32954-32961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The present work shows the same two effects on band 3 expression in human red cells. Normal red cells (which contain GPA) have enhanced band 3 anion transport activity and normal N-glycosylation. In GPA-deficient cells, the size of the N-glycan chain on band 3 is altered, indicating altered treatment of band 3 by the Golgi apparatus of these cells (20.Bruce L.J. Groves J.D. Okubo Y. Thilanganathan B. Tanner M.J.A. Blood. 1994; 84: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, band 3 anion transport activity is reduced in GPA-deficient red cells; however, the total number of band 3 molecules/mature red cell is normal. Unlike the transient expression of band 3 in Xenopus oocytes, the amount of band 3 in the mature red cell reflects the steady state and is probably limited by some structural feature of the red cell membrane controlling the number of band 3-binding sites. This study shows that the structure and function of band 3 are altered in red cells that lack GPA or in GPA mutants lacking residue 59 to the C terminus. Fluorescence quenching and polarization experiments indicated that the EMA-binding pocket, which is probably the anion access channel, has greater flexibility in GPA-deficient red cells. These GPA-deficient red cells show reduced band 3 anion transport activity, and the altered structure of band 3 affects monovalent and divalent anion transport in different ways. Taken together, the data indicate that band 3 can take up two conformations: one structure with high anion transport activity and another structure with lower anion transport activity. The formation of the high activity structure requires the presence of GPA, and GPA acts on band 3 either during band 3 biosynthesis or in the mature red cell membrane.

https://openalex.org/W1991508413,"Dimerization of bcd mRNA was shown to be important for the formation of ribonucleoprotein particles and their localization in Drosophila embryo. The cis-element responsible for dimerization is localized in a stem-loop domain (domain III) containing two essential complementary 6-nucleotide sequences in a hairpin loop (LIIIb) and an interior loop (LIIIa). Such an RNA element can potentially generate single or double “hand-by-arm” interactions leading to open and closed complexes, respectively. The former retains the possibility of forming multimers, whereas the latter does not. We showed previously that dimerization proceeds through a two-step mechanism, which includes a transition from the reversible initiation complex into a very stable one. Here we have addressed the nature of the initial interactions and the mechanism of transition. We engineered a series of different RNA fragments with the capacity to form defined open dimers, multimers, or closed dimers. We compared their thermodynamic and kinetic behavior and mapped nucleotides involved in intermolecular interactions by enzymatic and chemical footprinting experiments and chemical modification interference. Our results indicate that the initiation step leads to a reversible open dimer, involving a more limited number of intermolecular base pairs than expected. The two loops play distinct roles in this process, and the structure of loop IIIb is more constrained than that of loop IIIa. Thus, loop IIIa appears to be the driving element of the recognition process. The initial open dimer is then converted into a stable closed dimer, possibly through a kinetically controlled mechanism.

Thus, loop IIIa appears to be the driving element of the recognition process. The initial open dimer is then converted into a stable closed dimer, possibly through a kinetically controlled mechanism. RNA loop-loop interactions are commonly used to trigger initial recognition between two RNA molecules and to modulate a high diversity of biological functions (for a review, see Ref. 1Brunel C. Marquet R. Romby P. Ehresmann C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 925-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The frequent selection of hairpin loops as recognition motifs is explained by their intrinsic properties. Their accessibility and structural versatility allow them to adopt a variety of conformations, thus enabling an appropriate presentation of nucleotides that initiate the recognition process. This initiation step generally involves Watson-Crick pairing of a few nucleotides, preferentially G-C pairs. Usually, efficient recognition requires rapid bimolecular binding rates, regardless of the RNA pairing scheme. The initial loop-loop complex generally serves as an intermediate for subsequent stabilization involving different possible paths, such as isomerization, helix propagation, and formation of additional interactions (1Brunel C. Marquet R. Romby P. Ehresmann C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 925-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Kolb F.A. Engdahl H.M. Slagter-Jager J.G. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Westhof E.

Hairpin loops recognition is particularly well documented in the case of natural antisense RNAs, which play a variety of regulatory roles in bacteria and their extrachromosomal elements (1Brunel C. Marquet R. Romby P. Ehresmann C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 925-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 4Wagner E.G. Simons R.W. Annu. Rev.

Another well studied case is the dimerization of genomic RNA of HIV-1, 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1human immunodeficiency virus 1UTRuntranslated regionDMSdimethysulfateDEPCdiethylpyrocarbonateENUethylnitrosoureaCMCT1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonateDoopen dimerDcclosed dimer. which is initiated by a loop-loop interaction involving an autocomplementary six-base sequence in a hairpin loop (reviewed in Ref. 1Brunel C. Marquet R. Romby P. Ehresmann C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 925-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The above mentioned examples mainly concern recognition between two hairpin loops and are referred to as “kissing” interactions. Interaction might also involve complementary sequences located in a hairpin loop and an interior loop (“hand-by-arm” interaction). This type of interaction can potentially generate “closed” dimers, involving a double symmetric hand-by-arm interaction, or multimers. The latter mode is used by Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi29 RNA, in which cyclic hexamers of the 120-base prohead RNA are formed and are needed for efficient in vitro packaging of the DNA genome (6Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17510-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Chen C. Zhang C. Guo P. RNA. 1999; 5: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Another example of hand-by-arm interaction is provided by dimerization of bicoid (bcd) mRNA, the product of which specifies the head and thorax pattern in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. human immunodeficiency virus 1 untranslated region dimethysulfate diethylpyrocarbonate ethylnitrosourea 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate open dimer closed dimer. Dimerization of bcd mRNA was shown to be important for the formation of ribonucleoprotein particles containing bcd mRNA and their localization in the embryo (8Ferrandon D. Koch I. Westhof E. Nusslein-Volhard C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cis-acting element that triggers dimerization is part of the 3′-UTR of the mRNA, which folds into five well defined domains (Fig. 1E). 2C. Brunel and C. Ehresmann, submitted for publication. It corresponds to an RNA stem loop (domain III) that contains six-base complementary sequences located in the apical loop, LIIIb, and the interior loop, LIIIa (Fig. 1D). Recently, we showed that bcd mRNA dimerization is a two-step mechanism involving a rapid conversion of the initial reversible loop-loop complex into an almost irreversible one (9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This was supported by dissociation kinetics and the observation that sense or antisense oligonucleotides are unable to inhibit dimerization once stabilization has begun. On the other hand, we found that the isolated domain III (RNA III) formed reversible dimers and multimers, as accounted for by the hand-by-arm interaction possibilities, whereas the complete 3′-UTR RNA did not. It appeared from deletion analysis that domain I and the major part of domains IV and V are dispensable for the transition to the stable complex (9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This raises two important questions: (i) is a single or a double hand-to-arm interaction required for initiating dimerization, and (ii) how does stabilization proceed? In the present work, we constructed RNA fragments of different lengths, which can form either two or a single hand-by-arm interaction, and we compared their ability to be converted into stable complexes. We used enzymatic and chemical probing to map the interactions in the different kinds of complexes. Finally, we used chemical modification interference of the phosphate backbone and bases to identify individual positions of nucleotides that are essential in unmodified form to the dimerization process. Our results provide important clues on both the initial step of dimerization and the stabilization pathway. They also highlight the importance of loop IIIb structure as a trigger of the initial recognition and of the structural context in the fate of the reversible dimer. Plasmids used in this study were described previously (9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The NlaIV-HindIII bcd fragment of the plasmid pΔ(IV+V) (9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the StuU-HindIII sites of the pUT7 vector, a pUC derivative containing the T7 RNA polymerase, to create the plasmid pΔ(I+IV+V). PCR fragments corresponding to the isolated domain III (m,w) or (w,m) were generated from plasmid 875 (m,w) using primers 1 and 2 and from plasmid 875 (w,m) using primers 1 and 3 (Table I). RNA III issued from those PCR products starts at position 231 and ends at position 335 (using the numbering of the full-length bcd 3′-UTR). The III′ series starting at position 231 and ending at position 347 was generated from the plasmid 875 (m,w) using primers 1 and 4 and from plasmid 875 (w,m) using primers 1 and 5. PCR products were purified by gel electrophoresis and transcribed by phage T7 RNA polymerase (10Jossinet F. Paillart J.C. Westhof E. Hermann T. Skripkin E. Lodmell J.S. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. RNA. 1999; 5: 1222-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Transcription with incorporation of ApG at the 5′ terminus of the transcripts allowed efficient 5′ end-labeling by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP (10Jossinet F. Paillart J.C. Westhof E. Hermann T. Skripkin E. Lodmell J.S. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. RNA. 1999; 5: 1222-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Unlabeled and labeled RNAs were purified by polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis, eluted overnight by 0.5 m sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 volume of phenol, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in water.Table IPCR primers used to construct the different plasmids in this studyNameSequence1GAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAATACGCTATTGCGCTT2AAGGAATACGCTTAA GCCCAAATGG CCTCAAATG3AAGGAATA CGCTTAGTGACAAATGGCCTCAAATG4CGATAACTTTCCATGGAATACGCTTAAGCCCAAATGGCCTC5CGATAACTTTCCATGGAATACGCTTAGTGACAAATGGCCTC6CGATAACTTTCCATG Open table in a new tab RNAs were heated for 3 min at 85 °C and cooled slowly at 60 °C. After the addition of the 5-fold concentrated appropriate buffer, the samples were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and then chilled on ice. Standard dimerization buffer (D1) contained 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. Monomers were obtained by replacing buffer D1 by buffer M1 (50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2). When necessary, monomeric and dimeric forms were separated by gel electrophoresis. Short fragments (RNA III series) were fractionated at 4 °C on 10% acrylamide/(bis-acrylamide 1/30) gels in 45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 50 μm MgCl2, and larger fragments on 1% (w/v) agarose gel in the same buffer. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) were evaluated by mixing a negligible constant concentration of labeled wild-type RNA III (∼0.1 nm) with increasing concentrations of its unlabeled RNA partner (ranging from 4.6 to 270 nm). Dimerization was conducted under standard conditions in buffer D1 and fractionated by electrophoresis (see above). Radioactivity was measured with a BAS 2000 BIO-Imager. Kd values were estimated as the concentration of unlabeled RNA necessary to obtain half-saturation, assuming that complex formation (homo- or heterodimers) obeys a simple bimolecular equilibrium. The treatment assumes that [free unlabeled RNA] = [total unlabeled RNA]. This condition is fulfilled in the assay because the concentration of labeled wild-type RNA III is negligible compared with the concentration of its unlabeled RNA partner. Kd values were the average of at least three independent experiments and have a maximum error of ±50%. For kinetics of association, a negligible constant concentration of labeled wild-type RNA III was mixed with a constant concentration (50 nm and 100 nm) of its unlabeled RNA partner in buffer D1, and aliquots were loaded onto the gel at different times (9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For dissociation experiments, the complex was formed at 5 nm (a concentration that disfavors multimerization of wild-type RNA III), and subjected to a 50-fold dilution. Aliquots were analyzed as a function of time (9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Time 0 was obtained by running an aliquot of the dimerization mixture immediately before dilution. It was also verified that no dimer was formed when the RNA was incubated for 30 min at the final concentration obtained after dilution. Most experiments were conducted on 5′ end-labeled fragments (1.2 μm) of the RNA III series. Enzymatic Hydrolyses—Incubation was for 2 to 8 min at 25 °C in the presence of 0.2 unit of RNase T1, 0.02 unit of RNase T2, and 0.2 or 0.05 unit of RNase V1 in buffer D1 or M1. Reactions were stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Dimethysulfate (DMS) Modification (C(N3))—Reaction was for 5 min at 25 °C with 2.5 or 5 μl of DMS in buffer M1 or D1. After precipitation with 0.3 m sodium acetate and 3 volumes of ethanol, samples were treated with 10 μl of hydrazine 10% for 5 min at 0 °C and precipitated. Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) Modification (AN7)—Reaction was for 12 min at 25 °C with 2.5 or 5 μl of DEPC in buffer M1 or D1. After precipitation with 0.3 m sodium acetate and 3 volumes of ethanol, samples were treated with 10 μl of hydrazine 10% for 5 min at 0 °C and precipitated. The modified RNAs were then incubated with 10 μl of aniline for 10 min at 60 °C for the cleavage reaction. Cleavage products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gel. RNase T1 and alkaline ladders of end-labeled RNAs were run in parallel to facilitate band assignment (11Brunel C. Romby P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 3-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of RNase T1 footprinting on larger fragments (RNA ΔI series), cleavage was detected by reverse transcriptase extension of a primer complementary to nucleotides 389-400. Fractionation was on 10% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gel. The appropriate 5′ end-labeled fragment of the RNA III series (0.35 μm) was alkylated on its phosphate groups by ethylnitrosourea (ENU). Modification was for 1 min at 90 °C with 0.5 volume of ENU-saturated ethanol in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, in the presence of total tRNA (2 mm) as carrier. An incubation control was done in parallel using the same conditions except that ENU was omitted. The reaction was stopped by precipitation with 0.3 m sodium acetate and 3 volumes of ethanol. The modified RNA was then dissolved in water, mixed with its unlabeled partner, and submitted to the dimerization procedure. Dimeric and monomeric species were fractionated and RNAs eluted from the gel by overnight incubation at 4 °C in 0.5 m sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 volume of phenol. After ethanol precipitation, ethylated phosphates were cleaved by incubation in 10 μl of Tris-HCl 0.1 m, pH 9.0, at 50 °C for 10 min. End-labeled RNA fragments were sized on a 10% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gel. Cleavage positions were identified by running in parallel the RNase T1 and alkaline ladders of the end-labeled RNA (11Brunel C. Romby P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 3-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The appropriate fragment (1.2 μm) of the RNA III′ series was modified with DMS (A(N1) and C(N3)) or 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT) (G(N1) and U(N3)). Modification with DMS was for 1 min at 90 °C with 0.001 volume of DMS in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA in the presence of total tRNA (2 mm) as carrier. Modification was stopped by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol (100 mm) and ethanol precipitation. Modification with CMCT was for 1 min at 90 °C with 0.025 volume of CMCT (70 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium borate, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA in the presence of total tRNA (2 mm) as carrier. Modification was stopped by ethanol precipitation. Incubation controls were run in parallel in the absence of chemicals. The modified RNAs were mixed with their unmodified partner and subjected to the dimerization procedure. Dimeric and monomeric species were fractionated as above. In this case, modified nucleotides were analyzed by primer extension with reverse transcriptase, using as a primer an oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 335-347. Conditions were adapted from Brunel et al. (12Brunel C. Romby P. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). RNA III Preferentially Forms One Hand-to-Arm Interaction—We previously showed that wild-type RNA III (RNA III(w,w)) forms dimers that dissociated rapidly, whereas larger tested RNAs do not dissociate within 1 h (9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, RNA III multimers were formed in a concentration-dependent manner and dissociated rapidly. RNA III(w,w), which contains both loops LIIIa and LIIIb available for interactions, can form either a double hand-by-arm interaction (closed dimer, Fig. 1A) or single interactions leading to multimers (Fig. 1B). Because the initial recognition of bcd mRNA can potentially be driven by one or two hand-to-arm interactions, we compared the intrinsic behavior of RNA III(w,w) and derivate variants mutated in one of the two loops. Mutations introduced were identical to those already used (8Ferrandon D. Koch I. Westhof E. Nusslein-Volhard C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). RNA III(m,w) carried the substitution of AGUGAC for AAGCCC282 in loop IIIb and a wild-type sequence loop IIIa. Conversely, RNA III(w,m) carried the substitution of GUCACU for GGGCUU322 in loop IIIa and a wild-type sequence loop IIIb. Each mutated RNA was unable to dimerize by itself. However, the addition of RNA III(w,w) permitted the recruitment of the mutant RNA in a heterodimer through the nonmutated sequence loop, thus forcing dimerization through one hand-to-arm interaction (Fig. 1C, “open” dimer). This system allowed us to evaluate the apparent dimerization dissociation constant (Kd) of different combinations of RNA III. Experiments were done by mixing a constant negligible amount of labeled wild-type RNA III(w,w) with increasing concentrations of unlabeled RNA III(w,m) or RNA III(m,w). Because RNA III(w,w) is unable to dimerize at the chosen concentration, it was possible to study the properties of open dimers exclusively. The Kd of RNA III(w,w), which could not be determined precisely, because of the formation of multimers, was estimated to be ≤10 nm. The Kd values determined for both heterodimers formed with either RNA III(m,w) or (w,m) fell in the same range (Fig. 2C). Then we compared association and dissociation of the complexes formed by RNA III(w,w) alone or in association with RNA III(w,m) or III(m,w), as a function of time. The formation of wild-type dimers and heterodimers was already completed within 30 s of incubation at both 50 and 100 nm (Fig. 2A). This rapid association contrasts with the slower association observed for the complete 3′-UTR for which half-association required 12 min at a concentration of 125 nm (9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As expected, trimers and low amounts of higher species were also observed in the case of RNA III(w,w). For dissociation experiments, the complex was formed at 5 nm (a concentration that disfavors multimerization of wild-type RNA III) and subjected to a 50-fold dilution (9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Half-dissociation occurred within the minute range in every case (Fig. 2B), again contrasting with an absence of dissociation in the case of the complete 3′-UTR (9Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L. St Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the heterodimers were totally dissociated, whereas the wild-type RNA yielded a constant fraction (30%) of dimer resistant to dissociation (Fig. 2B). This finding suggests that RNA III(w,w) forms two types of dimers. The major fraction, which displays kinetic properties similar to the heterodimers, probably corresponds to dimers utilizing a single loop-loop interaction (open dimers). These dimers are available to further multimerization. The minor fraction that forms stable dimers might correspond to closed dimers. Probing the Conformation of RNA III and Its Two Variants—We probed the conformation of monomeric RNA III(w,w), III(w,m) and III (m,w) with enzymatic and chemical probes. RNase T1 cleaves unpaired G residues, RNase T2 preferentially cleaves unpaired As (and Us to a weaker extent), and RNase V1 cleaves double-stranded regions. DMS and DEPC alkylate C(N3) and A(N7), respectively. RNA(w,w) was probed under low salt conditions (buffer M1), which favor the monomeric form. RNA III(w,m) and III(m,w), which are intrinsically unable to self-dimerize, were tested under the same conditions but also under the high ionic conditions (buffer D1) used to promote dimerization. Representative gels are shown in Fig. 3, and the results obtained for the three RNAs are summarized in Fig. 4A.Fig. 4Summary of the probing and footprint experiments conducted on RNAs III.A, enzymatic and chemical probing. Enzymatic cleavage by RNase T1 is indicated as an arrow ending in a square, RNase T2 as an arrow ending in a circle, and RNase V1 as a simple arrow. The intensity of the cleavage increases with the darkness of the symbols.

A red star indicates increased reactivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The experimental data fully account for the proposed secondary structure shown in Fig. 4A. In particular, loops IIIa and IIIb were highly accessible to enzymes and chemical reagents in the three RNA tested. The cleavage and modification profiles of the three RNAs looked very similar, with only a few changes at or close to the mutation sites. The expected changes directly linked to the mutations are observed (e.g. new RNase T1 cut at G278 and G280 instead of G279 in RNA III(m,w), disappearance of cleavage at G318 and G319 in RNA III(w,m)) (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, RNase T1 cleavages at G309 and G310, in the terminal part of helix IIIb, were dramatically increased in RNA III(w,m) under low salt conditions (Fig. 3A). These cuts probably arise from secondary cleavage resulting from a downstream primary cut (most likely G317) in the loop IIIa mutant context. Nonetheless, this is a unique reactivity change not directly located at mutation sites, and taken together the data show that mutations do not perturb the structural organization of the RNA. In addition, probing the RNA III variants at both salt conditions did not reveal any significant difference (data not shown). Finally, cleavage and modification patterns were very similar to those obtained for wild-type or mutated domain III in the full-length bcd 3′-UTR,2 leading to the conclusion that domain III forms an independent structural domain and that RNA III is representative of what happens in the whole RNA. Footprinting Loop-Loop Interactions in RNA III Complexes— The involvement of loop IIIa and IIIb nucleotides in intermolecular interactions was first tested by RNase T1 footprinting in the three types of complexes. Heterodimers were formed in buffer D1 by mixing 5′-labeled RNA III(w,m) or III(m,w) and unlabeled RNA III(w,w), so that only the RNA forming one loop-loop interaction could be visualized. A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 3A, and the results are summarized in Fig. 4B. Upon its association with RNA III(w,w), RNA III(m,w) underwent a loss of cleavage at G317, G318, and G319, whereas G278 and G280 remained fully accessible in the mutated loop IIIb. Conversely, G279 was protected in RNA III(w,m) upon association with RNA III(w,w), whereas G317 remained accessible. Notably, cleavage at G309 and G310, which was enhanced as a result of loop IIIa mutation (see above), was reduced upon formation of the heterodimer with RNA III(w,w) (Fig. 3A). This protection might result from a stabilization induced by the high ionic concentration used for dimerization rather than dimerization itself. Homodimers were formed by mixing 5′-labeled RNA III(w,w) and unlabeled RNA III(w,w). A clear protection in both loops (G279 in loop IIIb and G317, G318, and G319 in loop IIIa) was observed, as expected from the implication of both loops in multimers (Fig. 1B). We then used DMS and DEPC to get a more precise footprint of the loop-loop interactions and to test the participation of the two 6-nucleotide complementary sequences (GGGCUU322 in loop IIIa and AAGCCC282 in loop IIIb) in intermolecular base pairing. Modification with these two chemicals, followed by direct detection on end-labeled RNAs, allows probing of cytosine at a Watson-Crick position (N3) and adenine at its Hoogsteen position (N7), respectively. Note that the nonreactivity of A(N7) can be caused either by direct involvement in hydrogen bonding or by base stacking (13Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). As expected, a strong reduction of reactivity of C280, C281, and C282 to DMS was observed in RNA III(w,m) upon association with RNA III(w,w) as well as in RNA III(w,w) multimers (Figs. 3B and 4B). This result accounts for base pairing between these three C residues and complementary G residues (317-319) of loop IIIa. Besides, the reactivity of C274 was unchanged. More unexpectedly, C318 remained fully reactive to DMS (even a little more) in RNA III(m,w)/RNA III(w,w) heterodimers and in RNA III(w,w) multimers (Figs. 3B and 4B). This result argues against base pairing between C318 and G279, suggesting that base pairing is more limited than expected, at least in the open complexes. Otherwise, the reactivity of A276, A277, and A278 to DEPC was strongly reduced (Fig. 3C and 4B). Because our results suggest that base pairing is probably limited to three base pairs, CCC282/GGG317, the reduction of reactivity of AAA278 to DEPC might be due to a stacked conformation rather than to base pairing. As these A-residues were highly reactive in the free RNA, it appears that the stacked conformation results from a conformational adjustment triggered by formation of the limited i"

We have developed a novel approach of attaching a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) peptide to DNA in a non-essential position, by generating a fusion between the tetracycline repressor protein TetR and the SV40-derived NLS peptide. The high affinity and specificity of TetR for the short DNA sequence tetO was used in these studies to bind the NLS to DNA as demonstrated by the reduced electrophoretic mobility of the TetR·tetO-DNA complexes. The protein TetR-NLS, but not control protein TetR, specifically enhances gene expression from lipofected tetO-containing DNA between 4- and 16-fold. The specific enhancement is observed in a variety of cell types, including primary and growth-arrested cells. Intracellular trafficking studies demonstrate an increased accumulation of fluorescence labeled DNA in the nucleus after TetR-NLS binding. In comparison, binding studies using the similar fusion of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) with NLS peptide, demonstrate specific binding of PNA to plasmid DNA. However, although we observed a 2–8.5-fold increase in plasmid-mediated luciferase activity with bis-PNA-NLS, control bis-PNA without an NLS sequence gave a similar increase, suggesting that the effect may not be because of a specific bis-PNA-NLS-mediated enhancement of nuclear transfer of the plasmid. Overall, we found TetRNLS-enhanced plasmid-mediated transgene expression at a similar level to that by bis-PNA-NLS or bis-PNA alone but specific to nuclear uptake and significantly more reliable and reproducible.

Nuclear translocation of a DNA-vector complex is a crucial limiting step in non-viral transfection (1Uherek C. Wels W. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2000; 44: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Nishikawa M. Huang L. Hum. Gene Ther. 2001; 12: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Several studies with different transfection agents have shown that plasmid is efficiently internalized into cells but less than 1% of the DNA present in the cytoplasm reached the nucleus (3Pollard H.

In addition, several groups provided experimental evidence that cells undergoing mitosis are far more readily transfected than cell cycle arrested or quiescent cells, suggesting that the dissociation of the nuclear membrane during mitosis greatly facilitates nuclear entry (5Zabner J.

Fortunati E. van den Broek M. Hoogeveen A.T. Scholte B.J. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 1133-1142PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear membrane is a tight barrier and transport of large macromolecules from the cytoplasm to the nucleus occurs through a specialized structure of the nuclear envelope, the nuclear pore complex (for review see Refs. 7Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar and 8Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Transport of proteins occurs by an energy-dependent process involving the interaction of specific highly basic nuclear localization sequences (NLS) 1The abbreviations used are: NLSnuclear localization sequenceX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranosideMSCmesenchymal stem cellsPNApeptide nucleic acid.1The abbreviations used are: NLSnuclear localization sequenceX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranosideMSCmesenchymal stem cellsPNApeptide nucleic acid. with the nuclear pore complex (9Christophe D.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The nuclear membrane is also a tight barrier for exogenous DNA or RNA and many proteins of the karyophilic viruses contain NLS sequences, which are involved in active transport of the viral genome through the nuclear pore (11Harel A. Forbes D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E267-E269Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). nuclear localization sequence 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside mesenchymal stem cells peptide nucleic acid. nuclear localization sequence 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside mesenchymal stem cells peptide nucleic acid. Several studies have shown that the addition of an NLS peptide to non-viral gene transfer complexes can increase their transfection efficiency (12Collas P. Alestrom P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 45: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Zanta M.A. Belguise-Valladier P. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). However, when the highly basic NLS peptide binds to DNA by electrostatic interaction, the increase in nuclear import of the plasmid is modest (14Gao X. Huang L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 15Fritz J.D. Herweijer H. Zhang G. Wolff J.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and it seems that the direct interaction of the NLS peptide with DNA can impair its nuclear import capacity (16Chan C.K. Hubner S. Hu W. Jans D.A. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1204-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Cartier R. Reszka R. Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Chemical modification and random covalent coupling of peptides to a gene expression cassette can also have detrimental effects (18Sebestyen M.G. Ludtke J.J. Bassik M.C. Zhang G. Budker V. Lukhtanov E.A. Hagstrom J.E. Wolff J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 19Neves C. Escriou V. Byk G. Scherman D. Wils P. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1999; 15: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Little increase in nuclear targeting was obtained by use of an NLS peptide linked to a DNA by triple helix formation with a single DNA target (20Neves C. Byk G. Scherman D. Wils P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas covalently linking an NLS peptide to one end of capped linear DNA produced promising results (13Zanta M.A. Belguise-Valladier P. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). However, this technique is time consuming, expensive, and difficult to scale up. To be efficient the NLS peptide should be able to bind with high affinity to a non-essential DNA sequence and remain accessible for recognition by the nuclear pore complex. Here, we compare two approaches for site-specific binding of an NLS peptide to DNA. The first system exploits the tetracycline repressor protein TetR, a homodimer, with high affinity and specificity for a palindromic short DNA sequence known as the tetracycline operator sequence tetO. In bacteria, in the absence of tetracycline, the repressor binds to this sequence (association constant Ka 1011m-1) inhibiting the expression of the two genes it controls (21Hillen W. Unger B. Klock G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 22Saenger W. Orth P. Kisker C. Hillen W. Hinrichs W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 2042-2052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This system has also been widely applied to control gene activities in eukaryotic cells (23Baron U. Bujard H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 401-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used its affinity for the operator sequence to attach an NLS peptide to plasmid vector DNA (Fig. 1A) by producing a fusion protein between the TetR protein and the well known NLS peptide from the SV40 large tumor antigen (13Zanta M.A. Belguise-Valladier P. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 15Fritz J.D. Herweijer H. Zhang G. Wolff J.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and have investigated the ability of the fusion protein TetR-NLS to increase DNA nuclear import. For comparison we have also exploited the ability of a dimeric homopyrimidine bis-PNA (peptide nucleic acid) (24Larsen H.J. Nielsen P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Nielsen P.E. Egholm M. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 1999; 1: 89-104PubMed Google Scholar) to strand invade double stranded plasmid DNA and bind to a target site in a triplex interaction. Previously, binding of duplex forming PNA-NLS to 11 target sites of plasmid DNA has been used for nuclear import, resulting in enhanced DNA expression by 5–8-fold (26Branden L.J. Mohamed A.J. Smith C.I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), whereas binding of PNA-NLS to a 15-bp fluorophore-tagged oligonucleotide was used to demonstrate nuclear entry (26Branden L.J. Mohamed A.J. Smith C.I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 27Branden L.J. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This approach requires denaturation and reannealing of DNA plasmids for effective PNA binding and has not resulted in widespread application, probably because of the technological demands of this cumbersome method. We hypothesized that the use of a bis-PNA binding by strand invasion at room temperature to form a triplex structure may enable us to use a bis-PNA-NLS conjugate for nuclear targeting using only a single target site in the plasmid DNA. We demonstrate here a significant and reproducible enhancement of nuclear import and transgene expression by our TetRNLS system in a variety of cell types, including primary and growth-arrested cells. By contrast, despite specific binding of all our PNAs to a single site in plasmid DNA, transfection enhancement is observed using either bis-PNA-NLS or bis-PNA alone at low and high PNA:DNA binding ratios suggesting that this is not because of NLS-mediated nuclear localization. Construction of the TetR-NLS Fusion Protein and the Reporter Gene Plasmid—Plasmids expressing the TetR-NLS protein or the TetR protein were constructed using the pMal-c2 vector (New England Biolabs). To construct the pMal-TetRNLS plasmid, the tetR sequence was PCR amplified from pUHD15-1 using a primer encoding the NLS from the SV40 large tumor antigen (pkkkrkvedp) with an XbaI and EcoRI site at the 5′ and 3′ end of the NLS. The amplification product was digested with EcoRI and inserted into the XmnI/EcoRI-digested pMal-c2 vector using blunt end and EcoRI ligation, resulting in the pMal-TetRNLS plasmid. The control plasmid pMal-TetR was obtained by digestion of the plasmid pMal-TetRNLS by XbaI and self-ligation to remove the SV40NLS sequence. For construction of the reporter gene plasmids a XhoI/SacI fragment containing seven tetO operator sequences (TCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGA) was amplified by PCR from the pUHD10-3 plasmid using a primer that inserts a BamHI site at the 5′ end and a SalI site at the 3′ end of the fragment. This BamHI/SalI fragment was then inserted into the BamHI/SalI-digested pGL3-control plasmid (Promega). The final construct pGL3-7tetO contains the luciferase reporter gene under control of the SV40 promoter and seven TetR-binding sites (7tetO) in the 3′ untranslated region of the expression cassette. Plasmid pGL3-2X7tetO containing the 7tetO fragment upstream and downstream from the expression cassette was constructed by insertion of the 7tetO fragment digested with XhoI/SacI into the XhoI/SacI-digested pGL3 vector. The second 7tetO fragment digested at the terminal BamHI and SalI sites was then inserted into this BamHI/SalI-digested vector. A linear DNA fragment of 2770 bp containing the reporter luciferase gene and the seven tet operator sequences at the 3′ end (Frag7tetO) was obtained by digestion of the plasmid pGL3-7tetO with BglII and SalI. A control fragment containing only the reporter gene was obtained by digestion with BglII and BamHI. A DNA fragment of 3052 bp (Frag2X7tetO) in which the luciferase gene is flanked by 7tetO sequences 5′ of the SV40 promoter and 3′ to the untranslated region of the luciferase gene was obtained by digestion of plasmid pGL3–2X7tetO by SacI. The fragment containing the 7tetO-binding site was also inserted into a β-galactosidase expression plasmid using the SalI site. This 8.7-kb construct, pβGal-7tetO, contains the nuclear targeting β-galactosidase transgene under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter with the 7tetO fragment at the 3′ end. Expression and Purification of the TetR-NLS Fusion Protein—E. coli DH5α carrying plasmids pMal-TetR or pMal-TetRNLS were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to A600 nm of 0.5. After addition of 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce protein expression, the culture was incubated for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellet was resuspended in protein extraction buffer Bugbuster (Novagen). After an incubation of 1 h at room temperature, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. To purify the protein, the cell lysate was loaded onto an amylose resin column (New England Biolabs). Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washes with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and the protein of interest was eluted in the same buffer with 10 mm maltose. The protein-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon centricon unit and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The purified samples were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified by BCA protein assay (Pierce), before storage at -20 °C. An average of 3 mg of purified protein can be obtained per liter of bacteria culture. Complex Formation and Binding Study of the TetR-NLS Fusion Protein—The desired amount of DNA (plasmid or linear fragment), which contains the 7tetO fragment was incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 5 mm MgCl2 (21Hillen W. Unger B. Klock G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), with the fusion protein TetR-NLS or with the control protein TetR at different molar ratios of dimer protein to plasmid. The same quantity of protein was used with the control DNA. The protein·DNA complexes were loaded on a 1% agarose gel made up in 1× TBE and containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. For the inhibition binding experiment, the complex buffer was supplemented with a tetracycline analogue, the doxycycline hydrochloride (Sigma). PNA-NLS Molecules and Plasmid Constructs—J-bis-PNA H-(k)3TTJTTJTTTT(eg)3TTTTCTTCTTk-NH2 was the kind gift of Dr. Peter Nielsen (Center for Biomolekylaer Genkendelse, Copenhagen, Denmark). Control bis-PNA H-(k)3TTCTTCTTTT(L)3TTTTCTTCTTk-NH2 and bis-PNANLS H-pkkkrkvedpyc(k)3TTCTTCTTTT(L)3TTTTCTTCTTk-NH2 were synthesized by Oswel (Southampton, UK). Peptide nucleic acids are listed above with PNA Watson-Crick bases capitalized and amino acids in lowercase. The lysines (k) added to bis-PNA-NLS and control bis-PNA are designed to improve PNA stability and hoogsteen binding to DNA because of their positive charge, and to give these PNAs a slight net positive charge. L refers to a flexible AEEA linker (amino 2,6-dioxaoctanoic acid), whereas, eg refers to a similar flexible hydrophilic linker (8-amino 3,6 dioxaoctanoic acid). J refers to the synthetic nucleobase pseudoisocytosine, which exhibits a positive charge. The SV40-modified NLS alone, H-pkkkrkvedpyc-NH2, was synthesized by Affiniti Research Products Ltd. (Mamhead, Exeter, UK). Primers PNAXFwd 5′-TCGACTTTTCTTCTTG-3′ and PNAXRev 5′-TCGACAAGAAGAAAAG-3′ were used to insert a PNA-binding site, specific for all of the PNAs, flanked by dual SalI sites in pDlox3 (28Bigger B.W.

The CMV/luc cassette from pCIKLUX (28Bigger B.W. Tolmachov O. Collombet J.M. Fragkos M. Palaszewski I. Coutelle C. J. Biol.

The final constructs pNIX2 and pNIX10 contain the PNA-binding site at the end of the luciferase gene, or in front of the cytomegalovirus promoter, respectively. PNA Binding and Assay for Restriction Digest Blocking—1 μl of PNA in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, with a final concentration of 0–20 μm, was added to 1 μl of template DNA (usually 40 or 200 ng). The reaction was buffered with 8 μl of TE at pH 8.0 or 9.0 as appropriate, to reach a pH of 7.6, in a 10-μl final volume of reaction buffer. This 10-μl reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, to achieve binding of PNA to DNA by strand invasion. The salt concentration was then adjusted to 100 mm NaCl by the addition of 1.2 μl of 10× React 3 (1×, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl) (Invitrogen) and 1 μl of either SalI (flanking the PNA-binding site) or EcoRI (80 bp downstream of the PNA binding site), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. This reaction was then run on a 1% agarose gel to visualize digestion of DNA. Cell Transfection and Transgene Detection—NIH 3T3, HeLa, A549, COS7, and N18 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were derived from the femur of a neonatal lamb. Briefly, whole marrow was flushed in phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized by fine chopping of the calcified material. A red blood cell lysis and filtration was performed and cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline + 2% fetal calf serum before counting and resuspension in human mesencult medium (StemCell Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions for human MSC derivation. Sheep MSCs were derived by their ability to adhere to tissue culture dishes and their fibroblastic properties and cultured for a maximum of two passages in human mesencult medium (StemCell Technologies) prior to transfection. Cells were seeded, 24 h before transfection, in 48- or 24-well tissue culture plates to reach 60 to 70% confluence during transfection. The complexes TetR-NLS·DNA or PNA·DNA were prepared as described above with 0.25 or 0.4 μg of plasmid (depending on the tissue culture plate) or the desired amount of linear fragment to give an identical gene copy number. The complexes were diluted in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) was added to the pre-formed DNA complexes at a DNA:liposome ratio of 1:12 (w/w) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to complete the lipoplex formation before adding to cells. After 3 h, transfection mixtures were replaced with complete medium. The transgene activity was measured after 24 h using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Roche Diagnostics) or a chemiluminescent β-galactosidase reporter assay kit (Roche Diagnostics). The protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) and the enzyme activities were expressed as relative light units per milligram of cellular protein. Each experiment was performed at least three times. For the in situ β-galactosidase visualization, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde/glutaraldehyde solution and X-gal staining was performed. Cells were then counted, at least three separate times for each well to determine the transfection efficiency and each transfection experiment was repeated at least three times. For transfection on cell cycle-arrested cells, cells were grown to 60–70% confluence and the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and containing aphidicolin at 5 μg/ml (Sigma). After an incubation of 24 h, transfections were carried out as described above with medium containing aphidicolin. For the experiment in the presence of doxycycline, the complex buffer and the cell medium were supplemented with doxycycline hydrochloride (Sigma) at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Cell Trafficking Study—To label the fragment Frag2X7tetO, without damaging the TetR-NLS binding recognition motifs tetO, the DNA was digested with MluI and SalI producing a 5′ protruding end. The recessed 3′ end of the fragment was then filled using exonuclease-free Klenow-DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and Cy3-UTP for 1 h at 37 °C. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a QiaQuick purification column (Qiagen). Cells were plated on glass coverslips for 1 day and transfections were performed as described using 0.5 μg of labeled DNA. After 1 or 2 h at 37 °C, cells were fixed with a solution of paraformaldehyde (3%) for 20 min at room temperature. After several washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were mounted in fluoro mounting medium (ICN Biomedicals) and observed on a fluorescence microscope. Construction, Expression, and Purification of the Recombinant TetR-NLS Protein—A plasmid designed for bacterial expression and purification of the protein TetR-NLS, which contains the TetR repressor in fusion with the SV40-derived NLS-peptide or the control protein TetR alone were constructed in the pMal-c2 vector (New England Biolabs) (Fig. 1A). In this vector, the cloned gene was inserted downstream from the malE gene of Escherichia coli, which encodes the maltose-binding protein, resulting in expression of TetR-NLS as an maltose-binding fusion protein. After induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside the protein was overexpressed in bacteria and the fusion protein can be purified easily from the bacterial lysate on an amylose resin column using the affinity of the maltose-binding protein for maltose. As shown in Fig. 1B the resulting product can be found as a major band at 67 kDa on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Crucially, after dialysis in an appropriate buffer, the recombinant TetR proteins are able to form functional homodimers equivalent to the wild type TetR repressor protein (29Orth P. Alings C. Schnappinger D. Saenger W. Hinrichs W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 99-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). TetR-NLS Protein Binds Specifically to tetO Containing DNA—To investigate whether the TetR-NLS fusion protein could specifically bind the tetO operator sequence as effectively as the TetR protein, we performed a gel retardation assay using plasmid pGL3–7tetO carrying recognition motifs (tetO) at the 3′ end of the luciferase gene (Fig. 2A). In accordance with the established uses of TetR/tetO interaction in gene expression studies (30Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar) we constructed this vector with 7 TetR operator sequences (7tetO). Both TetR and TetR-NLS proteins, respectively, appear as one major band of reduced electrophoretic mobility corresponding to protein-DNA complexes. A small fraction of DNA was still able to migrate into the gel as noncomplexed DNA. As already described for the wild type Tet repressor (21Hillen W. Unger B. Klock G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), binding of the fusion protein is more efficient in the presence of a low concentration of MgCl2. This binding reaction is specific because gel retardation was not observed with the control plasmid that does not contain the tetO sequence. Similar experiments were performed with a linear DNA fragment containing the 7tetO sequence or with a control fragment. Again retardation was achieved when the tetO sequence was present but in the presence of MgCl2 no free DNA was observed suggesting that binding of the protein to the linear fragment is more efficient than to the circular plasmid. As a further demonstration of specificity, we investigated the effect of the antibiotic tetracycline on binding of the TetR-NLS to the tetO sequence fragment. The Tet repressor affinity for the operator sequences is abolished by complexing it with the antibiotic (23Baron U. Bujard H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 401-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 31Hillen W. Gatz C. Altschmied L. Schollmeier K. Meier I. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 707-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the TetR-NLS system, we found that tetracycline inhibits the binding only partially (data not shown) and therefore applied the more potent tetracycline analogue, doxycycline (23Baron U. Bujard H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 401-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 32Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar). At a molar ratio Dox:TetR-NLS of 1:1, the binding of the Tet repressor to the DNA was partially abolished. When the concentration of doxycycline was increased to a ratio 5:1, the DNA was completely released from the TetR-NLS protein and migrated freely into the gel (Fig. 2B). This indicates that the formation of the TetR-NLS·DNA complex is indeed because of the binding between the TetRNLS and the tetO sequence and not the result of nonspecific interaction. TetR-NLS Enhances Lipofection—To investigate the ability of the TetR-NLS fusion protein to enhance gene transfer, protein·DNA complexes were formed at several different molar ratios (1–10 corresponding to 10:250 ng to 100:250 ng) of protein dimer to plasmid using the luciferase expression plasmid pGL3–7tetO and then adding the cationic lipid LipofectAMINE to the complexes. Because the addition of the protein can modify the size of the lipid·DNA complexes and could thereby influence transfection, the size profile of the different complexes was studied by photon correlation spectroscopy. After 30 min, the size of the lipid·DNA complexes were 188 ± 30 nm. A slight increase in size was observed when the protein TetR-NLS or TetR was added to the complexes resulting in an average size of the complexes of 204 ± 30 nm at a ratio of 5 and 216 ± 30 nm at a ratio of 10. The LipofectAMINE·protein·DNA complexes formed at different ratios were used to transfect NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3). At a molar ratio of protein dimer/plasmid of 5:1, the fusion protein TetR-NLS increases the transfection efficiency of the LipofectAMINE more than 4-fold, whereas no enhancement of transfection efficiency was observed with the control plasmid pGL3. These data indicate that the TetR-NLS protein enhances gene transfer in a specific manner involving binding to the tetO operator sequence and that this enhancement is because of the presence of the NLS peptide as it was not observed with the Tet repressor alone. Higher ratios of protein·DNA did not improve the gene transfer. Because the fusion protein binds the linear fragment more efficiently and because we assume that efficient nuclear targeting of non-viral constructs also depends on a large extent on the size of the transferred constructs, the same transfection experiments were done with a 2.7-kb DNA fragment containing only the luciferase expression cassette with the 7 tetO sites at its 3′ end (Frag7tetO). The amount of DNA used (125 ng) was calculated to provide an identical number of transgenes as the intact plasmid (Fig. 3). The lipofection efficiency of the linear fragment was about 1 order of magnitude lower than plasmid lipofection. This is most likely because of degradation of the unprotected DNA ends by exonucleases. However, the enhancement of transfection by the TetR-NLS protein was significantly higher than with the DNA plasmid, about 8-fold"

We show instead that both sex and genotype of C. elegans can be altered postembryonically and that this flexibility requires sexual reproduction. When grown in specific bacterial metabolites, some XX larvae generated by mating males and hermaphrodites develop as males and lose one X chromosome. However, XX larvae produced by hermaphrodite self-fertilization show no such changes. We propose that sexual reproduction increases developmental flexibility of progeny, allowing for better adaptation to changing environments."

In addition, different SAgs bind and activate different TcRVβ isoforms during pathogenesis of human immune cells. These two properties of SAgs prompted us to design several chimeric DRα1-linker-TcRVβ proteins using different TcRVβ isoforms to create chimeras that would specifically inhibit the pathogenesis of SAgs against which they were designed. In this study, we compare the design, interaction, and inhibitory properties of three different DRα1-linker-TcRVβ chimeras targeted against three different SAgs, SEB, SEC3, and TSST-1. The inhibitory properties of the chimeras were tested by monitoring IL-2 release and T cell proliferation using a primary human cell model. We demonstrate that the three chimeras specifically inhibit the pathogenesis of their target superantigen. We performed molecular modeling to analyze the structural basis of the type specificity exhibited by different chimeras designed against their target SAgs, examine the role of the linker in determining binding and specificity, and suggest site-specific mutations in the chimera to enhance binding affinity. The fact that our strategy works equally well for SEB and TSST-1, two widely different phylogenic variants, suggests that the DRα1-linker-TcRVβ chimeras may be developed as a general therapy against a broad spectrum of superantigens released during Staphylococcal infection.

The S. aureus SAgs have been implicated as the causative agents in a number of human diseases, including food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome. SAgs have also been shown to promote the onset of chronic conditions such as autoimmune and inflammatory skin diseases by weakening the host immune system (3Schiffenbauer J. Johnson H.M.

The mechanism of S. aureus pathogenesis has been attributed to an alternate mode of SAg binding. In contrast to foreign antigens, SAgs bypass the internalization and processing by the antigen-presenting cell (APC), and instead bind as intact protein externally to the DRα1 domain of the MHC class II receptor on APCs and the Vβ domain of the T cell receptor (TcR) on T cells (6Jardetzky T.S.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The alternate binding of SAg to the MHC class II-TcR complex is followed by two additional signaling events between APCs and T cells, the engagement of co-stimulatory ligands and their cognate receptors such as the B7 ligand and CD28 (10Reiser H. Stadecker M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and the involvement of the autocrine and paracrine cytokine network (11Haddad J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002; 297: 700-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SAgs also have the ability to bind to multiple isoforms of TcRVβ (12Choi Y.W. Kotzin B. Herron L. Callahan J. Marrack P. Kappler J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8941-8945Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) and can activate up to 20% of T cells compared with 0.0001% by a conventional antigen, resulting in the activation of a large population of T cells (13Sundberg E. Li Y. Mariuzza R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Until a decade ago, staphylococcal infection was effectively treated with the antibiotics, methillicin (14Kreiswirth B. Kornblum J. Arbeit R.D. Eisner W. Maslow J.N. McGeer A. Low D.E. Novick R.P.

However, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus has prompted development of several non-antibiotic-based therapies (16Hong-Geller E. Gupta G. J. Mol. Recog. 2003; 16: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), including superantigen-based vaccines (17Shinefield H. Black S. Fattom A. Horwith G. Rasgon S. Ordonez J. Yeoh H. Law D.

We have taken a structure-based (or rational design) approach to construct bi-specific chimeric inhibitors composed of the DRα1 domain of MHC class II and Vβ domain of the TcR connected by a flexible (GSTAPPA)2 linker.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Based on the structure-function relationship between SAgs and their receptors, we expect these chimeras to bind competitively and prevent the SAg from binding to the MHC class II receptor of APCs and the TcR of T cells. Given that different SAgs exhibit different patterns of TcRVβ usage (12Choi Y.W. Kotzin B. Herron L. Callahan J. Marrack P. Kappler J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8941-8945Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), it is possible to choose a TcRVβ isoform that is specific to a given SAg. Thus, the use of different TcRVβ isoforms in our chimeras may impart specificity toward a particular SAg but not to others. Using this strategy, we have previously reported that a DRα1-(GSTAPPA)2-TcRVβ3 chimera inhibited SEB-induced IL-2 cytokine release and T cell proliferation in a mixture of human peripheral mononuclear and dendritic cells (23Lehnert N.M. Allen D.L. Allen B.L. Catasti P. Shiflett P.R. Chen M. Lehnert B.E. Gupta G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4222-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Vβ3 isoform has been shown to be activated by S. aureus SEB (12Choi Y.W. Kotzin B. Herron L. Callahan J. Marrack P. Kappler J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8941-8945Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Our approach, which employs the use of a chimeric protein to block the initial step of SAg pathogenesis, namely the ligation of APC and T cells, has several unique features. Although the individual DRα1 and TcRVβ domains of the chimera show poor binding to their target sites on the SAg, the SEB-specific chimera bound to SEB with micromolar affinity, which is comparable to that of SAg binding to the MHC class II or T cell receptors (24Kappler J. White J. Kozono H. Clements J. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8462-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Malchiodi E.L. Eisenstein E. Fields B.A. Ohlendorf D.H.

This synergistic binding of the constituent DRα1 and TcRVβ domains to SAg was made possible by our choice of a flexible linker that allows the chimeric protein to simultaneously interact with two functional sites on the SAg, which are too far apart to be spanned by a single antibody. Therefore, the fact that the chimera can block the two functional sites on SAg simultaneously would make the chimera a superior inhibitor to an antibody that can block only one of the two functional sites. This is supported by the observation that an antibody that binds to SEB with high affinity (Kd ∼nm), but only partially covers the DRα1-binding site on SEB, is a poor inhibitor of pathogenesis (23Lehnert N.M. Allen D.L. Allen B.L. Catasti P. Shiflett P.R. Chen M. Lehnert B.E. Gupta G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4222-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we have constructed two additional chimeric proteins to specifically target TSST-1 and SEC3. We demonstrate that these chimeras do exhibit SAg type-specific inhibitory properties. In addition, we performed molecular modeling on the three different SAg-chimera complexes based on available biochemical and crystallographic data to understand the structural basis of the type-specific inhibition, especially the role of various pairwise contacts between SAg and DRα1, SAg and TcRVβ, and the role of the (GSTAPPA)2 linker in determining binding and specificity. Cloning of Chimera Genes—Construction of the SEB chimera has been previously described (23Lehnert N.M. Allen D.L. Allen B.L. Catasti P. Shiflett P.R. Chen M. Lehnert B.E. Gupta G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4222-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For the TSST-1 and SEC3 chimeras, the DRα1 and linker domain was amplified from the SEB construct using the primers 5′-gatcagatctatcaaagaagaacatgtg-3′ and 5′-gatcgctagccgctggtggcgccgtcg-3′ to add BglII (bold) and NheI (underlined) sites to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The DRα1/linker region was ligated into BamHI/NheI-digested pRSETc vector (Stratagene) using T4 ligase (NEB). The pRSETc vector introduces an N-terminal His6 tag that allows for protein purification with the TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech). The TSST-1 TcRVβ2 domain was constructed in two steps. First, the following four oligos were used: A, 5′-ctagccaacatccgagcagggttatctgtaagagtggaacctctgtgaagatcgagtgccgttccctggactttcaggccacaactatgttttggtaccgtcag-3′; B, 5′-cgggaactgacggtaccaaaacatagttgtggcctgaaagtccagggaacggcactcgatcttcacagaggttccactcttacagataaccctgctcggatgttg-3′; C, 5′-ttcccgaaacagagtctcatgctgatggcacttccaatgagggctccaaggccacatacgagcaaggcgtcgagaaggacaagtttctcatcaaccatgcaagcctgaccttgtccG-3′; and D, 5′-AATTC-ggacaaggtcaggcttgcatggttgatgagaaacttgtccttctcgacgccttgctcgtatgtggccttggagccctcattggaagttgccatcagcatgagactctgttt-3′. 2 μl of 100 μm A, B, C, and D oligos were annealed together in the A/B and C/D configuration for 5 min at 70 °C and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The annealed oligos were then phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) using 10 μm ATP for 30 min at 37 °C. The two phosphorylated, annealed A/B and C/D oligos recreated 5′ NheI (underlined) and 3′ EcoRI (capitalized) sites and were ligated into the NheI/EcoRI-digested pRSETc vector containing the DRα1/linker region. In the second step, we appended an additional 19 residues of the TcRvβ sequence at the C terminus to include a second cysteine residue that plays an important role in domain stability. To accomplish this, we amplified the existing cloned DRα1/linker/TcRVβ sequence using the primers 5′-gatcagatctatcaaagaagaacatgtg-3′ and 5′-ggacaaggtcaggcttgcatggttgatgagaaa-3′ to introduce a 5′-BglII (bold) site and a 3′-blunt end site. The following two oligos, E, 5′-accctgaccgttacctctgctcacccggaagactcttctttctacatctgctctgcttagG-3′ and F, 5′-AATTCctaagcagagcagatgtagaaagaagagtcttccgggtgagcagaggtaacggtcagggt-3′, were annealed together, phosphorylated, and combined with the DRα1/linker/TcRVβ PCR product and BamHI/EcoRI-digested pRSETc in a ligation reaction. The final intact construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The SEC3 TcRVβ sequence was PCR amplified from a mutagenized variant mL2.1/A52V (kind gift of D. Kranz, University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana) (27Kieke M.C. Sundberg E. Shusta E.V. Mariuzza R.A. Wittrup K.D. Kranz D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-gatcgctagcgtgacattgagctgtaatcag-3′ and 5′-gatcGAATTCctaggcacagaagtacactgatgt-3′, which introduces 5′-NheI (underlined) and 3′-EcoRI (capitalized) sites for cloning into NheI/EcoRI-digested pRSETc plasmid containing the DRα1/linker domain. The amplified Vβ8.2 fragment contains seven out of the nine original mutations in the mL21/A52V mutant (Fig. 1). The two remaining mutations G17E and G96V mutations lie outside the consensus TcVβ domain we used for the human Vβ2 and Vβ3 sequences. Protein Overexpression and Purification—The pRSETc vectors containing each of the three chimeras were transformed into BL21 Escherichia coli competent cells. Cells were induced for expression with 2 mm IPTG for 5 h, lysed with 1 mg/ml lysozyme on ice for 30 min, followed by treatment with 10 μg/ml DNase and 10 mm MgCl2 for an additional 30 min, and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 30 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, 1% Tween-20 (pH 8.0), homogenized using a probe sonicator, and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 30 min. The resultant supernatants were incubated with TALON Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech), and purification of the His-tagged chimeras was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the lysates were rocked for 20 min at room temperature, the resin washed twice with 20 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, 1% Tween-20, 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), and the adsorbed chimera protein eluted with 20 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, 1% Tween-20, 100 mm imidazole (pH 5.3). The proteins were dialyzed stepwise in decreasing concentrations of urea: 1) PBS, 1% Tween-20, 4 m urea; 2) PBS, 1% Tween-20, 2 m urea, and finally 3) PBS, 1% Tween-20. Following quantitation using BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce), proteins were stored at 4 °C and used in experiments within 2 weeks. Human Cell Culture and Inhibition Studies—The SEB, TSST-1, and SEC3 toxins were purchased from Toxin Technology, Inc. Human donor-matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and dendritic cells (DCs) (Clonetics) in a 20:1 ratio were cultured in LGM3 media supplemented with 10% donor matched human serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For the dose response curves, increasing concentrations of either SEC3 or TSST-1 were incubated with ∼106 PBMCs/DCs in 1 ml for 10 h. In the inhibition studies, either 20 pm SEC3 or 50 pm TSST-1 were incubated with increasing concentrations of the three chimeras, 5×, 10×, or 20× the molar concentration of the SAgs or left untreated for 1hat37 °C. The SAg/chimera mixtures were then incubated with ∼106 PBMCs/DCs for 10 h at 37 °C. Cell supernatants were collected and IL-2 release measured using the standard sandwich ELISA. 2 μg/ml of capture IL-2 antibody (BD Pharmingen) were adhered to Nunc Immunosorp 96-well plates overnight in 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.5. The following day, wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline/0.05% Tween-20, blocked with Assay Diluent (BD Pharmingen) for 1 h, and incubated with the cell supernatants for 2 h. Wells were then incubated with 1 μg/ml of biotinylated detection anti-IL-2 antibody (BD Pharmingen), followed by 1:1000 dilution of streptavidin-HRP, for 1 h each. Signal was developed using the Substrate Kit (BD Pharmingen) and 2 m H2SO4 stop solution. Colorimetric changes were measured using a Labsystems Multiskan Plus plate reader (Fisher Scientific, Springfield, NJ), and concentrations of IL-2 were determined against a standard curve using defined amounts of recombinant IL-2 in ELISAs performed in parallel. Cell Proliferation—T cell proliferation was measured using the Vialight HS cell proliferation/cytotoxicity kit (BioWhittaker) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 105 PBMCs/DCs (20:1) were plated in white-walled, clear-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plates and treated with 1 nm TSST-1 or 1 nm SEC3 in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of the purified chimeras for 4 days. Only 105 PBMCs were used for stimulation with 1 pm SEB. 100 μl of Nucleotide Releasing Reagent was added to each well for 15 min to extract the ATP, followed by 20 μl of ATP Monitoring Reagent. The plate was then loaded into a luminometer (Turner Designs, Inc.) within 10 min of after addition of the ATP Monitoring Reagent for measurement of light emission. Molecular Modeling—The molecular modeling consisted of three steps. (I) The SAgs and their binding partners, MHC class II receptor and TcR, do not exhibit any significant structural changes upon complex formation. Also, structural studies indicate that SEB, SEC3, and TSST-1 engage in a similar spatial arrangement during contact with the MHC class II receptor (13Sundberg E. Li Y. Mariuzza R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Arcus V. Proft T. Sigrell J. Baker H. Fraser J. Baker E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the initial models of the SAg/chimera complexes were constructed based on the crystallographic data as well as biochemical information on intermolecular contacts between DRα1/TcRVβ and the SAgs. We used the following crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB): 1) 1SEB, 1SBB, for the SEB-chimera complex; 2) 1JCK and 1SEB for the SEC3-chimera complex; and 3) 1SEB, 2TSS, and 1FYT for the TSST-1-chimera complex. The DRα1 model for all three chimeras was constructed from the single crystal structure of SEB-MHC class II (1SEB). BLAST (29Altschul S. Madden T. Schaffer A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59917) Google Scholar) searches against the PDB enabled us to identify structures with the highest sequence identity (88–24%) with the three different TcRVβ sequences (Vβ3, Vβ2, and modified Vβ8.2) used in the three chimeras. We used homology modeling to construct the initial models of the TcRVβ domains of the chimera (30Sanchez R. Sali A. J. Comp. Phys. 1999; 151: 388-401Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The relative spatial positions of DRα1 and TcRVβ with respect to the SAgs were derived from the three crystal structures: bipartite complexes (SEB-MHC class II: 1SEB), (SEB-TcR: 1SBB), and (SEC3-TcR: 1JCK) by superposition of the toxins. In the case of the TSST-1 complex, conserved structural features of the toxins such as the α-helices α1 and α3 (Figs. 4 and 5) were chosen to orient the SAg in the complex. The relative positions of DRα1 and TcRVβ with respect to TSST-1 were fixed based on structural studies (7Kim J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 31Papageorgiou A. Quinn C. Beer D. Brehm R. Tranter H. Bonventre P. Acharya K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1737-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The linker (GSTAPPA)2 was placed between the C terminus of DRα1 and the N terminus of TcRVβ. Each SAg-chimera complex was minimized locally in vacuum without any constraints using the AMBER 4.1 force field (32Pearlman D. Case D. Caldwell J. Ross W. Cheatham III, T. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Chandra Singh U. Weiner P. Kollman P. AMBER 4.1. University of California, San Francisco, CA1995Google Scholar); the parm94 parameter set was applied with a dielectric constant of 80 to a gradient limit <10-2 kcal/mol Å2.Fig. 5Structural alignment based on SSAP (39Orengo C.

Secondary structure elements as determined by experimental structures are highlighted for each sequence: β-sheets (light gray) and α-helices (dark gray). Contact residues between the SAg and chimera are marked by the following color scheme: DRα1, cyan; TcRVβ, blue; linker, red; and multiple contacts, purple. Contacts observed in crystal structures or previously reported are underlined using the same color code as the highlights: SEB-DRα1:1SEB, cyan; SEB-TcRVβ:1SBB, blue; SEC3-TcRVβ:1JCK, blue. SEC3-DRα1 contacts (cyan) were adopted from contacts of the closely homologous SEC2-DRα (31Papageorgiou A. Quinn C. Beer D. Brehm R. Tranter H. Bonventre P. Acharya K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1737-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). TSST-1-DRα (cyan) contacts were identified from the bipartite crystal structure (7Kim J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and TSST-1-TcRVβ (blue) contacts are from (31Papageorgiou A. Quinn C. Beer D. Brehm R. Tranter H. Bonventre P. Acharya K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1737-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The black underlined residues mark contacts of the TSST-1 flexible loop region to DRα1, DRβ, and to the antigenic peptide (7Kim J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C.

Black boxes mark the contact regions that are shown in close up views in Fig. 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (II) Molecular dynamics simulations of the three chimera-SAg complexes were performed at 300K for 200 ps in vacuum with a dielectric constant of 80 with the energy-minimized model as the t = 0 configuration. Both, intra- and intermolecular constraints were imposed in the simulation. All intra- and intermolecular constraints were based on the available crystal structures (1SEB, 1SBB, 1JCK, 2TSS, 1FYT). Intramolecular constraints (force constants were set to 5 kcal/mol Å2) were used to maintain the native folds of the SAgs, DRα1, and TcRVβ. The “weaker” intermolecular constraints (force constants set to 2 kcal/mol Å2) were applied to allow movement and sufficient flexibility of the partners in the complex. Intermolecular contacts for the SEB-chimera complex were derived from the following crystal structures SEB-DRα1: 1SEB and SEB-TcRVβ:1SBB. Intermolecular contacts for the SEC3-chimera complex were adopted from the crystal structure of SEC3-TcRVβ complex (1JCK) and the observed interactions in the homologous crystal structure of DRα1-SEC2 complex (27Kieke M.C. Sundberg E. Shusta E.V. Mariuzza R.A. Wittrup K.D. Kranz D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the case of the TSST-1-chimera, experimental contact information is available only for the TSST-1-DRα1 interaction (7Kim J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). No intermolecular constraints were employed between TSST-1 and TcRVβ. No constraints were applied to the (GSTAPPA)2 linker. After an equilibration period (∼100ps), 100 snapshots (one after every picosecond) were isolated for the 101–200 ps segment of the MD trajectory and minimized. An average structure of the 100 minimized snapshots was also calculated and minimized. (III) A systematic analysis of the 100 minimized snapshots and the minimized average structure revealed the nature of various pair-wise interactions and their variations around the average values. A root mean-square (RMS) matrix was computed for the 100 minimized snapshots to determine the conformational variations among the low energy structures of each SAg-chimera complex. RMS deviations were also computed between the minimized average structure and each of the 100 minimized snapshots to identify snapshots that were most closely or distantly related to the minimized average structure of the complex. To define the pairwise contacts between SAg and specific chimera, we calculated changes in solvent accessibility for each residue using the program MOLMOL (33Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) in the free SAg and the free chimera as well as in the SAg-chimera complex. A threshold of 3% change in the solvent accessible surface per residue was used to define a contact between the free SAg and the chimera due to complex formation. Thus, all residues that show a change in solvent accessible surface larger than 3% upon complex formation are defined as contact residues. Design of SAg Type-specific Chimeric Inhibitors—We have previously reported the design of a chimeric protein targeted against SEB (SEBc). This chimera, composed of the DRα1 domain of the MHC class II receptor linked to the Vβ3 domain of the T cell receptor, inhibited IL-2 release and T cell proliferation in a 20:1 mixture of PBMCs and DCs (23Lehnert N.M.

The appropriate length and sequence of the DRα1 and TcRVβ domains were chosen to retain the native structural folds present in the full-length MHC class II and T cell receptors. Two invariant cysteines that form a disulfide bond in the native fold as well as the contacting CDR1, CDR2, and HV4 loops were kept in the TcRVβ sequences. The DRα 1and TcRVβ domains were linked by two copies of GSTAPPA, a linker se"

It is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to receptor tyrosine activation and interacts with ras GTPase-activating protein and Nck, leading to inhibition of ras signaling pathway activation and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun activation, respectively. In chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, it has shown constitutive phosphorylation. The N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of Dok1 can recognize and bind specifically to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs of receptors. Here we report the crystal structure of the Dok1 PTB domain alone and in complex with a phosphopeptide derived from RET receptor tyrosine kinase. The structure consists of a β-sandwich composed of two nearly orthogonal, 7-stranded, antiparallel β-sheets, and it is capped at one side by a C-terminal α-helix. The RET phosphopeptide binds to Dok1 via a surface groove formed between strand β5 and the C-terminal α-helix of the PTB domain. The structures reveal the molecular basis for the specific recognition of RET by the Dok1 PTB domain. We also show that Dok1 does not recognize peptide sequences from TrkA and IL-4, which are recognized by Shc and IRS1, respectively. Dok1 is a common substrate of activated protein-tyrosine kinases.

These interactions are often mediated by adapter proteins, which simultaneously associate with several kinases of a signaling pathway, forming an ordered module that permits sequential activation of each enzyme and by anchoring proteins, which are tethered to subcellular structures and localize their complement of enzymes close to their site of action. The docking protein Dok1 appears to function as an adapter. It has been identified as the highly phosphorylated 62-kDa protein that interacts with ras GTPase-activating protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia progenitor cells and v-Abl-transformed preB cells (1Carpino N.

The PH domain is known to bind to acidic phospholids and localize proteins to the plasma membrane, whereas the PTB domain is known to mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs (8Dhe-Paganon S.

The many proteins that have been identified to contain PTB domains fall into two major groups. The first group contains PTB domains that have primary sequence similarity to the Shc PTB domain. The second group contains insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-like proteins such as IRS, Dok, and SNT/FRS2, which contain PTB domains with limited sequence similarity to the Shc PTB domain but similar binding characteristics (9Wolf G.

The Dok1 PTB domain belongs to the second group. It is 17% identical in sequence to the IRS PTB domain and was supposed to recognize sequences containing the NKLpY motif (10Songyang Z. Yamanashi Y. Liu D. Baltimore D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2459-2465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To better understand the PTB domain specificity of Dok and the interaction between Dok1 and RET, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of the murine Dok1 PTB domain alone and in complex with a phosphopeptide derived from RET. Peptide Synthesis and Binding Studies—The following peptides were synthesized by Sigma: the Shc-specific TrkA Tyr(P)-490 (Ac-HIIENPQpYFSDAGGK-NH2), the IRS1-specific IL-4R Tyr(P)-497 (Ac-LVIAGNPApYRSGGK-NH2), RET Tyr(P)-1062 (Ac-STWIENKLpYGMSDGGK-NH2) and RET Tyr-1062 non-phosphopeptide (Ac-STWIENKLYGMSDGGK-NH2). A C-terminal GGK extension was added to each of the peptides for coupling to the CM5 chip via the lysine side chain amino group. Binding analyses of the Dok1 PTB domain and the peptides were performed using a Biosensor BIAcore instrument (BIACORE 1000) (BIAcore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CM5 research grade sensor chips (BIAcore) were used. All buffers were filtered before use. The peptide concentration of 200 μg/ml and a contact time of 13.3 min at a flow rate of 3 μl/min gave ∼200 resonance units. Three phosphopeptides were coupled to different flow cells of the CM5 chip, respectively. A reference surface was generated simultaneously under the same conditions but without peptide injection and used as a blank to correct for instrument and buffer artifacts. All measurements were conducted in HEPES-buffered saline buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. After each measurement, the chip surface was regenerated with 5 μl of 6 m guanidine-HCl (pH 7.0) buffer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C. The Dok1 PTB domain was injected at variable concentrations at 20 μl/min flow rate, and binding to the peptides immobilized on the chip was monitored in real time. Response curves were prepared by subtracting the signal generated from the control flow cell. Kinetic parameters were determined using the software BIA evaluation 3.0. Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—The His-tagged murine Dok1 PTB domain (residues 154-266) was expressed and purified by Ni2+-chelation chromatography. The N-terminal His tag was removed by thrombin digestion, and the protein was purified as described previously. 2N. Shi, submitted for publication. Se-Met-substituted Dok1 PTB domain was produced in the methionine auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain B834 (DE3) (Novagen). Crystals of Se-Met-derived Dok1 PTB domain were grown in a hanging drop by mixing 1 μl of protein solution (7 mg/ml, 10 mm MES (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT) and 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 28% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.0), 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Crystals of Dok1 PTB domain in a complex with RET peptide were grown by the same method using 1 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml, 1 mm RET peptide, 10 mm MES (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT) with 1 μl of reservoir solution (30% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.1 m PIPES (pH 6.0), 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). The resulting crystals grew after 1 week at 16 °C. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Data were collected from a flash-frozen crystal after soaking the crystal in a reservoir solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. The MAD data were collected at the BL41XU beamline at SPring-8. Three different wavelengths were used to obtain the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data: 0.9798 Å (peak), 0.9800 Å (edge), and 0.9000 Å (remote). Data were integrated, scaled, and merged using the HKL programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. Vol. 276. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Crystals of the Dok1 PTB domain belong to the space group P212121, with unit cell parameters a = 41.1 Å, b = 56.2 Å, c = 99.6 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, containing two molecules per asymmetric unit. Three selenium sites were located and refined at 2.5-Å resolution using SOLVE (13Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The remaining residues were traced manually with O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar).

Data from the RET peptide complex crystals were collected at a wavelength of 0.9000 Å at the BL41XU beamline at SPring-8. The crystal also belonged to the space group P212121, containing two molecules per asymmetric unit, but with different unit cell parameters, a = 45.5 Å, b = 55.7 Å, c = 99.1 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. The structure of the complex was phased by molecular replacement using CNS with the model of the free Dok1 PTB domain as the starting model. The RET phosphopeptides bound to the Dok1 PTB domain were located using an Fo - Fc difference electron density map. Model building and fitting were carried out using O, and refinement and addition of water molecules were performed using CNS. Data collection, processing, and refinement statistics are given in Table I. The complex model consists of residues 154-256 of mouse Dok1, the 10 residues of the RET phosphopeptide, and 17 water molecules. Model quality was checked with PROCHECK (17Laskowski R.A.

Specificity of Phosphopeptide Binding—Affinity analysis was performed by means of surface plasmon resonance. The synthetic peptides derived from TrkA (residues 483-494), IL-4R (residues 489-499), and RET (residues 1054-1064) were coupled to the sensor chip, CM5 of BIAcore, and various concentrations of Dok1 PTB domain solutions were run over the chip. The dissociation constant (Kd) of binding of RET phosphopeptide to the Dok1 PTB domain was determined to be 3.2 μm from the data in Fig. 1a. Measurements made in the presence of 100-500 μm of its non-phosphorylated counterpart were unchanged. However, no binding could be detected for immobilized Trka and IL-4 peptides (Fig. 1, b and c), indicating binding specificity of the Dok1 PTB domain to the receptor. Structural Overview—The native structure of the Dok1 PTB domain was determined by MAD phasing to 2.5-Å resolution with Se-Met derivative data. Final statistics for the structure are given in Table I. The electron density was of good quality and well defined for most of the structure. The final model consists of residues 154-256 of mouse Dok1 in chain A, residues 154-254 in chain B, and 16 water molecules. The PTB domain of Dok1 adopts a “PH domain-like” fold, with seven strands forming a β-sandwich composed of two nearly orthogonal antiparallel β-sheets (Fig. 2a). The β-sandwich is capped at one end by a C-terminal α-helix. Structure of the Dok1 PTB Domain-RET Peptide Complex—To gain further insight into the molecular basis for the binding properties of the Dok1 PTB domain, we determined the structure of a 1:1 complex of the Dok1 PTB domain (residues 154-256) with an 11-residue peptide derived from the C-terminal of RET (residues 1054-1064). The structure of the complex was determined by molecular replacement using the native structure as a search model. The structure of the complex is displayed in Fig. 2a, and statistics for the structure determination are given in Table I. Clear density was observed for all residues of the RET peptide, with the exception of Ser in the -8 position relative to the phosphotyrosine (pY-8). The peptide-binding site on the Dok1 PTB domain is characterized by an L-shaped surface groove formed by residues from strand β5 and the C-terminal α-helix, α2. The peptide forms a β-turn to occupy the L-shaped binding site (Figs. 2a and 3). Phosphopeptide Recognition—Although it is known that PTB domains mainly recognize NPXpY motifs, careful analysis of binding indicates that these domains have slightly different binding specificities (9Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Asparagine in position -3 relative to phosphotyrosine (pY-3) and the phosphotyrosine group are necessary for binding to most PTB domains. A hydrophobic residue at position -5 and a proline at -2 are crucial for the Shc PTB domain, but the amino acids from -6 to -8 residues N-terminal to the phosphotyrosine are important for IRS1 binding to the NPXpY motifs. The proline in the NPXpY motifs also appears to be more important for IRS1 PTB binding than for Shc PTB binding. In addition, IRS1 PTB favors a small hydrophobic amino acid such as alanine at the -1 position. Substituting this alanine by a glutamate (such as insulin receptor) leads to a 30-fold loss of affinity for the IRS1 PTB domain. Studies with a combinatorial phosphopeptide library have indicated that the Dok1 PTB domain recognizes distinct sequences as compared with the IRS1 and Shc PTB domains. Leu at position -1 and hydrophobic amino acids Tyr, Met, and Phe at -6 were strongly selected for binding by the Dok1 PTB domain. Similar preferences for hydrophobic residues at position -5 to -8 have also been reported for other PTB domains. Our binding studies show that the Dok1 PTB domain can bind only with the RET peptide and not with the IL-4 receptor and TrkA peptides (Fig. 1). Previous experiments indicated that IRS1 can bind with IL-4 and insulin receptor peptides and also with the RET peptide but not with the middle T, TrkA, Erb4, or epidermal growth factor receptor peptides that have hydrophobic residues at position -5 relative to Tyr(P) (9Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2000; 20: 209-218Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Shc PTB domain can bind with mT, TrkA, Erb4, or epidermal growth factor receptor peptides and also with IL-4 and RET peptides (9Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F.

The distinct specificities of these PTB domains correlate with and may account for some biological differences between these cytoplasmic substrates of tyrosine kinase-linked receptors. Interactions between RET Peptide and the Dok1 PTB Domain—The RET peptide forms a β-turn and fills an L-shaped groove on the surface of the PTB domain that is formed by residues from the β5 strand and the C-terminal α helix. The estimated surface area of Dok1 PTB buried by the bound peptide is 761 Å2. The recognition groove is composed of residues from the β5 strand, the C-terminal α-helix, and the 310 turn connecting strands β4 and β5, including Tyr-203, Thr-204, Leu-205, Leu-206, Arg-207, Arg-208, Tyr-209, Arg-211, Ser-217, Phe-218, Gly-221, Arg-222, Phe-242, Ile-249, Gln-252, Lys-253. These residues make extensive contacts with all 10 residues of the RET peptide, through both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The phosphotyrosine is coordinated by Arg-207 and Arg-222, which extend from the β5 and β6 strands, respectively, and which are conserved in all Dok family proteins (Fig. 2b). The pY side chain lies in an open pocket created by the 310 turn and residues at the end of strands β5 and β6 (Fig. 2a). An extensive network of hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions coordinate the phosphate oxygens, consistent with the observation that phosphorylation of the tyrosine is necessary for peptide binding. Replacing Arg-207 with alanine eliminates the ability of the Dok1 PTB domain to bind phosphopeptides (6Murakami H. Yamamura Y. Shimono Y. Kawai K. Kurokawa K. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32781-32790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, integrin β3 and β7 can bind to the Dok1 PTB domain with their tails containing the Dok1 PTB domain recognition motifs (7Calderwood D.A. Fujioka Y. de Pereda J.M. Garcia-Alvarez B. Nakamoto T. Margolis B. McGlade C.J. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2272-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The replacement with alanine of the Tyr-747 at pY position of integrin β3 tails or the Tyr-778 at pY position of integrin β7 tails also disrupted binding to the Dok1 PTB domain (7Calderwood D.A. Fujioka Y. de Pereda J.M. Garcia-Alvarez B. Nakamoto T. Margolis B. McGlade C.J. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2272-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The backbone of N-terminal residues of the RET peptide, including residues pY-7 Thr, pY-6 Trp, pY-5 Ile, pY-4 Glu, pY-3 Asn, form a strand that hydrogen-bonds with strand β5 in an antiparallel orientation. In addition to backbone interactions, there are numerous contacts between the domain and peptide side chains that contribute specifically to the interaction. The indole ring of Trp-6 is bound in a pocket between β5 and β3 that is composed of Arg-208, Tyr-209, Gly-210, Ser-217, and Phe-218. This large pocket suggests that hydrophobic residues with large side chains might be selected here (Fig. 4b). Using a combinatorial peptide library approach, Songyang et al. (10Songyang Z. Yamanashi Y. Liu D. Baltimore D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2459-2465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) found that Tyr, Met, and Phe were strongly selected at this site. The side chain of Ile-5 shows numerous contacts with Phe-242 in the C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 4c). Large hydrophobic side chains are present at pY-5 in the Dok1 PTB domain recognition motifs. Integrin β3 and β7 can bind to the Dok1 PTB domain via their tails, which contain Dok1 PTB domain recognition motifs (7Calderwood D.A. Fujioka Y. de Pereda J.M. Garcia-Alvarez B. Nakamoto T. Margolis B. McGlade C.J. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2272-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Replacement of Asp-773 at the -5 position of integrin β7 tails with more hydrophobic Ala or Phe residues dramatically increased Dok1 PTB domain binding to β7 tails, and conversely, a substitution of Ala-742 to Asp at the -5 position in integrin β3 resulted in reduced binding to Dok1 PTB domain. The Asn at pY-3 is similar to that in other PTB domain recognition motifs NPXpY and appears to play an important structural role in stabilizing the β-turn of the peptides formed. The side chains of pY-4 Glu and pY-2 Lys extend away from the surface of the domain. In Dok1 PTB domain, Leu at the -1 position extends into a hydrophobic pocket composed of Gln-252, Ile-249, and Thr-204 and was exclusively selected (Fig. 4d). In addition, pY+1 Gly forms a hydrogen bond with Thr-204, and the side chain of pY+2 Met interacts with Lys-253 (Fig. 5a).Fig. 5Stereo view of the interactions between residues at pY-1 of the phosphopeptide, shown in brown, and Dok1 (a) or IRS1 (b) PTB domain.

Despite the low sequence homology, the overall structure of the Dok1 PTB domain is similar to its IRS1 (20Zhou M.M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazaki M. Trub T. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and Shc (21Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) counterparts. Dok1 shares the PH domain-like fold of the PTB domain family (22Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5610) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6) and a common mode of peptide binding, with the same β-turn conformation and orientation of phosphopeptide observed in each of the PTB domains. There are further similarities between IRS1 and the Dok1 PTB domain. Arg-212 and Arg-227, which recognize the phosphotyrosine in IRS1, are equivalent to Arg-207 and Arg-222 in the Dok1 PTB domain. These two residues are also conserved throughout the IRS protein family (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, the Dok1 PTB domain has a different set of residues for recognizing the peptide. In IRS1, pY-1 of the peptide interacts with a hydrophobic patch composed of Met-209, Met-260, Ser-261, and Met-257 (Fig. 5b) (20Zhou M.M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazaki M. Trub T. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Ala was selected in this position, and although pY-1 can be substituted for Glu or Leu, they would result in an unfavorable interaction with this patch. When the pY-1 Ala in IL-4R is substituted by a Glu, as in the case of the insulin receptor, the result is a 30-fold loss in binding to IRS1 (23He W. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23258-23262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In Dok1, pY-1 of the peptide interacts with a hydrophobic pocket composed of Gln-252, Ile-249, and Thr-204, and Leu was exclusively selected in this position (Fig. 5a). The different binding of TrkA and RET phosphopeptides to Dok1 may be due to the replacement of Gln by Leu at the pY-1 position. It is demonstrated that pY-1 Leu is very important to the Dok1 PTB domain binding motif. The proline in position pY-2 is known to be crucial for high affinity binding for Shc and IRS1. Substitution of this residue reduces but does not abolish binding for Shc PTB domain. Meanwhile, substitution of the pY-2 proline with alanine abolishes binding for IRS1 (9Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The side chain of pY-2 Lys extends away from the surface of the domain in Dok1 PTB, where it seems that a proline at position pY-2 is not essential. Large hydrophobic side chains are present at pY-5 in the Dok1 PTB domain recognition motifs, similar to Shc. However, there is insufficient space in the IRS1 domain complex to accommodate large, hydrophobic side chains at peptide position pY-5. As with the Shc PTB domain, the Dok1 PTB domain can also recognize the motifs of growth factor receptors and transforming proteins that possess large hydrophobic side chains at pY-5, whereas IRS1 does not bind to growth factor receptors. These differences indicate that Dok1 PTB recognizes distinct sequences (NXLpY) as compared with the Shc and IRS1 PTB domain (NPXpY). Dok1 PTB Domain Binding to RET Isoforms—The RET proto-oncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that is essential for the development of the enteric nervous system and the kidney. Germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene cause multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A or 2B (24Watanabe T. Ichihara M. Hashimoto M. Shimono K. Shimoyama Y. Nagasaka T. Murakumo Y. Murakami H. Sugiura H. Iwata H. Ishiguro N. Takahasi M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 2002: 249-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). RET has three isoforms, RET51, RET9, and RET43, formed by alternative splicing at a site just downstream of tyrosine 1062 (pY) (25Ivanchuk S.M. Myers S.M. Mulligan L.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These isoforms play different roles in tumor development. RET51-MEN2A and RET51-MEN2B mutant proteins have stronger transforming activity than RET9-MEN2A and RET9-MEN2B mutant proteins, respectively (26Pasini A. Geneste O. Legrand P. Schlumberger M. Rossel M. Fournier L. Rudkin B.B. Schuffenecker I. Lenoir G.M. Billaud M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The activity of RET43 is very low (27Carter M.T. Yome J.L. Marcil M.N. Martin C.A. Vanhorne J.B. Mulligan L.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 95: 169-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lee D.C. Chan K.W. Chan S.Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5582-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Tyr-1604 (pY+2) residue is different in each of these RET isoforms. The RET9 isoform has arginine in the pY+2 position, whereas RET43 has alanine and RET51 has methionine in the equivalent position. In our model of the Dok1 PTB domain-RET peptide complex, the RET peptide is derived from RET51, and the Tyr-1604 (pY+2) residue is a methionine that forms a hydrophobic interaction with residue Lys-253 that extends from the C-terminal α-helix (the distance between Cϵ of Met +2 to Cϵ of Lys-253 is 3.53Å) (Fig. 7a). When Met in the pY+2 position is replaced by Arg, there is still an interaction between Arg+2 and Lys-253, but it is weakened (the distance between Cζ of Arg+2 to Cϵ of Lys-253 is 3.73Å) (Fig. 7b). However, the substitution of Ala for Met at the pY+2 position abolishes the hydrophobic interaction altogether (Fig. 7c). These findings are consistent with the relative transforming activities of the RET isoforms. Conclusions—A detailed analysis of the structure of the Dok1 PTB domain and its complex with a RET phosphopeptide has revealed the basis for ligand recognition by the Dok1 PTB domain. We also show that the recognition of peptides by the Dok1 PTB domain is specific since Dok1 cannot bind IL-4 receptor and TrkA peptides that are recognized by Shc and IRS1 PTB domains, respectively. A structural comparison of the Dok1 PTB domain with other PTB domain structures explains their different peptide binding specificities. Furthermore, the distinct specificities of the PTB domains correlate with and should account for key biological differences between these cytoplasmic substrates of tyrosine kinase-linked receptors.

Molecular evolutionary analysis of the Nramp family revealed the early duplication of an ancestral eukaryotic Nramp gene, which was likely derived from a bacterial ortholog and characterized as a proton-dependent manganese transporter MntH (Makui, H., Roig, E., Cole, S. T., Helmann, J. D., Gros, P., and Cellier, M. F. (2000) Mol. Microbiol. 35, 1065–1078). Escherichia coli MntH represents a model of choice to study structure function relationship in the Nramp protein family. Here, we report E. coli MntH transmembrane topology using a combination of in silico predictions, genetic fusion with cytoplasmic and periplasmic reporters, and MntH functional assays. Constructs of the secreted form of β-lactamase (Blam) revealed extra loops between transmembrane domains 1/2, 5/6, 7/8, and 9/10, and placed the C terminus periplasmically; chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs indicated cytoplasmic loops 2/3, 6/7, 8/9, and 10/11. Two intra loops for which no data were produced (N terminus, intra loop 4/5) both display composition bias supporting their deduced localization. The extra loops 5/6 and 6/7 and periplasmic exposure of the C terminus were confirmed by targeted reporter insertion. Three of them preserved MntH function as measured by a disk assay of divalent metal uptake and a fluorescence assay of divalent metal-dependent proton transport, whereas a truncated form lacking transmembrane domain 11 was inactive. These results demonstrate that EcoliA is a type III integral membrane protein with 11 transmembrane domains transporting both divalent metal ions and protons."

There is high sequence similarity (∼30-45% identity) between the members of the α-hydroxy acid oxidizing enzymes although they differ in their cellular localization. Their range of occurrence includes the cytoplasm, the peroxisome of eukaryotic cells, the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and the cytoplasmic membrane. All the enzymes of this family follow a ping-pong mechanism. In this mechanism the flavin is first reduced to the hydroquinone by a 2-electron oxidation of the α-hydroxy acid substrate (the reductive half-reaction); subsequently, the flavin is reoxidized by an electron acceptor (the oxidative half-reaction). The mechanism of substrate oxidation appears to be similar among the members of this family. Two mechanisms have been proposed for the reductive half-reaction in this family of enzymes. One involves α-proton abstraction by a catalytic base with formation of a carbanion intermediate (11Ghisla S. Massey V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 1-17Google Scholar), and the other involves direct hydride transfer to the flavin ring (12Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Google Scholar). MDH differs somewhat in its substrate specificity from the other members of the enzyme family. Its physiological substrate, (S)-mandelate is bulky and sterically constrained compared with the small aliphatic substrate utilized by many of the other family members. Moreover, it favors substrates that are unsaturated in the β position (13Lehoux I.E. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5836-5848Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of MDH utilizing these latter substrates favor the carbanion intermediate mechanism (13Lehoux I.E. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5836-5848Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism of flavin reoxidation differs widely among various members of this enzyme family. In GOX and lactate monooxygenase (14Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Google Scholar), reduced flavin reacts directly and rapidly with molecular oxygen; in FCB2 and MDH electrons are transferred to cytochromes and to lipophilic organic molecules such as ubiquinone, respectively, and react slowly with molecular oxygen (4Lederer F. Muller, F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Flavoenzymes. Vol. 2. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 153-242Google Scholar, 15Xu Y. Mitra B. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Rudolf Weber, Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 487-490Google Scholar). In order to render MDH soluble in an aqueous solution for purposes of crystallization, a 39-residue internal peptide segment that is responsible for binding the enzyme to the cytoplasmic membrane was replaced with a 20-residue segment present in spinach glycolate oxidase (16Xu Y. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12367-12376Google Scholar). The resulting chimeric construct, named MDH-GOX2, yielded an enzyme that was fully soluble, could be crystallized, and retained full activity for mandelate oxidation, similar to that of wild type MDH. We have reported previously the crystal structure of oxidized MDH-GOX2 at 2.15 Å resolution (17Sukumar N. Xu Y. Gatti D.L. Mitra B. Mathews F.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9870-9878Google Scholar). In this paper, we present the 1.35 Å resolution structures of oxidized MDH-GOX2 and of its substrate-reduced form. Based on these near-atomic resolution structures, several important features of MDH-GOX2 are discussed including changes at the active site that accompany flavin reduction. We also discuss features of the active site in the reduced enzyme that may facilitate 1-electron transfers to organic acceptor molecules while preventing rapid reoxidation by molecular oxygen. Crystal Structure Analysis—The carboxyl-terminal histidyl-tagged MDH-GOX2 was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (16Xu Y. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12367-12376Google Scholar). The crystals of MDH-GOX2 were grown by the hanging drop method, as described (17Sukumar N. Xu Y. Gatti D.L. Mitra B. Mathews F.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9870-9878Google Scholar). Twinned crystals were rendered single by cutting them in half under a microscope as described previously (17Sukumar N. Xu Y. Gatti D.L. Mitra B. Mathews F.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9870-9878Google Scholar). Crystals of the oxidized enzyme were prepared for data collection by soaking them in an artificial cryoprotectant mother liquor (0.3 m MES, pH 6.2, 76 mm ammonium sulfate, 20-25% ethylene glycol, and 30 μm FMN) for several minutes prior to flash freezing in a cold nitrogen gas stream. Crystals of the enzyme in the reduced state were prepared by transferring an oxidized crystal from the cryoprotectant solution to one containing an additional 50 mm (S)-mandelate. On interacting with the substrate, the bright yellow color of the crystal, indicative of the oxidized state, disappeared, and the resulting colorless crystal was then immediately flash-frozen. The data for both the oxidized and reduced state were collected at the Structural Biology Center beamline 19 BM at Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL. Data collection was performed at 100 K using a fixed x-ray wavelength of 0.98 Å. The data from both the native and reduced crystals were processed by HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). Refinement of both structures was started using the program CNS (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) by placing the 2.15-Å model of MDH-GOX2 (17Sukumar N. Xu Y. Gatti D.L. Mitra B. Mathews F.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9870-9878Google Scholar) in the unit cell. For cross-validation, 10% of the data from both the oxidized and reduced crystals was selected randomly and set aside for calculation of Rfree (20Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Google Scholar). With subsequent positional and individual temperature factor refinement that included data to 1.35 Å in both structures, R and Rfree converged, respectively, to 0.265 and 0.276 for the oxidized form and 0.269 and 0.278 for the reduced form. A bulk solvent correction was then applied. Further refinement and model rebuilding using Turbo-Frodo (21Roussel A. Cambillau C. Turbo Frodo, Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphic, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar), combined with the addition of water molecules that showed well defined density in Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc electron density maps gave a final R of 0.184 and Rfree of 0.194 for the oxidized form and R of 0.187 and Rfree of 0.201 for the reduced form. All reflections for which F > 0 were included in the refinement. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. In the Ramachandran plot (22Ramakrishnan C. Ramachandran G.N. Biophys. J. 1965; 5: 909-933Google Scholar) calculated with PROCHECK (23Laskowski R. Thornton J. Moss D. MacArthur M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar), 88.3% of all non-glycine residues lies in the most favored region for the oxidized form, whereas 88.0% of these residues occurs in the most favored region for the reduced form. In both forms, one residue (Glu32) occupies a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot, a feature observed in the other two members of this family of proteins (24Xia Z.-X. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 837-863Google Scholar, 25Lindqvist Y. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab For the oxidized enzyme, the average isotropic temperature for factor B is 22.9 Å2 for all protein atoms and 31.8 Å2 for water molecules; for the reduced enzyme the respective B values are 21.2 Å2 and 31.4 Å2. In the oxidized structure the polypeptide segments Lys174-Leu179 and Gly186-Arg206 are poorly ordered, having B factors above 50 Å2 (Fig. 2). This pair of segments spans the GOX insert and extends beyond it by three residues toward the amino terminus and 10 residues toward the carboxyl terminus. In the reduced structure the same segments are also poorly ordered, although slightly less so. In both structures several side chains contain some atoms with zero occupancy (residues 174 and 206 in oxidized and residues 17, 59, 70, 120, 174, 189, 194, and 206 in reduced). Determination of the Affinity of Reduced MDH for the Product, Benzoylformate—The carboxyl-terminal histidyl-tagged wtMDH (which is catalytically very similar to MDH-GOX2 (16Xu Y. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12367-12376Google Scholar)) was prepared as described previously (13Lehoux I.E. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5836-5848Google Scholar) The affinity of benzoylformate for the reduced enzyme was determined by monitoring enzyme oxidation by benzoylformate in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer at 20 °C under anaerobic conditions as follows. One syringe was filled with 20 μm MDH reduced with 250 μm (S)-mandelate in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The second syringe was filled with increasing concentrations of benzoylformate and 250 μm (S)-mandelate in the same buffer. Solutions were made anaerobic by saturating them with argon. Reoxidation of reduced enzyme was monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance at 460 nm. In addition, time-dependent spectra corresponding to the appearance of oxidized FMN were recorded using a photo-diode array accessory connected to the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The data describing increases in absorbance at 460 nm were fitted by a double exponential kinetic model using the Pro/K software supplied by Applied Photophysics. High Resolution Structure of MDH-GOX2—MDH-GOX2 is a homotetramer having cyclic 4-fold symmetry and a subunit molecular mass ∼43,000. It crystallizes in a tetragonal unit cell in space group I4 with two tetramers per unit cell and one subunit per asymmetric unit. The current model for the oxidized subunit consists of residues 4-356, one FMN, one MES anion, one sulfate anion, and 400 water molecules. Residues 1-3 and 357-380 (including a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidyl tag) are disordered. The model of the reduced subunit has the same composition except that it has six fewer water molecules. The subunit folds as a β8α8 TIM barrel and is very similar in conformation to GOX and to FCB2. The r.m.s. deviation of MDH-GOX2 with respect to GOX and FCB2 is 1.17 Å for 332 equivalent Cα atoms and 1.12 Å for 311 equivalent Cα atoms, respectively. In the previous model of MDH-GOX2 determined at 2.15 Å resolution, four residues (194-197) could not be traced (17Sukumar N. Xu Y. Gatti D.L. Mitra B. Mathews F.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9870-9878Google Scholar). These residues are contained within the 20-residue GOX insert segment of the chimeric enzyme. In the current high resolution structures of both the oxidized and reduced enzymes the polypeptide chain of the GOX insert could be traced in full, with maximum B values of 65 and 52 Å2, respectively (Fig. 2). MDH-GOX2 is the first example of an α-hydroxy acid oxidizing enzyme of known structure in which the polypeptide chain is fully ordered except for beginning and end segments of the chain (Fig. 3). In FCB2, there is a 7-residue segment near the center of the sequence that is disordered (26Cunane L.M. Barton J.D. Chen Z.W. Welsh F.E. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Mathews F.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4264-4272Google Scholar), and in GOX a 9-residue segment, also central to the sequence, is disordered (25Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 151-166Google Scholar). Both of these segments are located between strand β-3 and helix α-3 of the TIM barrel and are flanked in sequence by several active site residues. Although MDH-GOX2 is unusual in being a chimeric enzyme, it is fully active with respect to the reductive half-reaction when compared with the wild type, detergent-solubilized form of the enzyme. Comparison of Reduced and Oxidized MDH-GOX2—The substrate-reduced and oxidized structures of MDH-GOX2 are nearly identical at 1.35 Å resolution. The overall r.m.s. deviation between equivalent Cα atoms in the two forms is 0.30 Å, and their overall ϕ/ψ difference is 3.2°. As expected, the largest differences are found in the less well ordered region containing the GOX insert (residues 174-207), where the B values are generally above 50 Å2. Of eight side chains that differ between the two forms by more than 1 Å, four are within this less well ordered region, and the remainder are surface residues with normal B values. There are seven active site residues, Tyr26, Tyr131, Asp158, Arg165, Lys231, His255, and Arg258, that are highly conserved among the α-hydroxy acid oxidizing enzymes and are believed to be important for catalyzing the reductive half-reaction. Of these, only Tyr26 differs in its side chain orientation (with r.m.s. deviation of 0.66 Å) in the oxidized and reduced structure, the others being within the 0.13-Å r.m.s. deviation on average. The surroundings of FMN are shown schematically in Fig. 4. The ribityl phosphate chain of the cofactor makes 13 hydrogen bonds with three main chain atoms, six side chain atoms, and four water molecules. The flavin ring forms seven hydrogen bonds with one main chain atom, four side chain atoms, and one water molecule. One of these is between the N-1 atom of FMN and the side chain of Lys231, one of the seven conserved active site residues mentioned above. Additionally, the flavin ring is in close contact (below 4 Å) with several residues including four other conserved active site residues. The sulfate anion is bound in the active site of the oxidized MDH-GOX2 and is in van der Waals contact with the flavin ring (Fig. 5A). It forms hydrogen bonds to three of the catalytically important side chains, Arg165, His255, and Arg258 and to four water molecules (Fig. 5B). It occupies the probable substrate-binding site that was identified in FCB2, where pyruvate binds (24Xia Z.-X. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 837-863Google Scholar), and in GOX, where glyoxylate has been modeled (7Lindqvist Y. Branden C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3624-3628Google Scholar). The anion had been identified previously in the 2.15-Å resolution MDH-GOX2 structure and is confirmed in the present study (Fig. 5A). In the mandelate-reduced structure of MDH-GOX2, the sulfate anion is also present in the active site and maintains the same interactions as in the oxidized enzyme. The configuration of the FMN is very similar in the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme. In both forms, the isoalloxazine ring is slightly bowed, with the re face of the flavin ring on the concave side (Fig. 5A). The bowed flavin ring can be treated either as two planes of 8 atoms each joined by a line connecting the N-5 and N-10 atoms (a “butterfly fold”) or as three planar rings, the pyrimidine, the dimethylbenzene, and the central diazo ring. An analysis of the least squares planes passing through each of these sets of atoms (including a single plane of 14 atoms) indicates that three separate planes provides a better model for the flavin than the butterfly fold (Table II). The dihedral angles of the pyrimidine and dimethylbenzene rings are 7.4 and 6.1° with respect to the central diazo ring, respectively, for the oxidized flavin. For the reduced flavin these angles increase slightly to 8.9 and 6.9°, respectively. The dihedral angles for the butterfly fold model for the oxidized and reduced states are 10.2 and 12.0°, respectively.Table IIRoot mean square deviations (in Å) of the flavin ring atoms from a single plane, two planes (butterfly fold) or three separate planes for the oxidized and reduced forms of MDH1 ring (14 atoms)Pyrimidine ring half (8 atoms)Dimethylbenzene ring half (8 atoms)Pyrimidine ring (6 atoms)Dimethylbenzene ring (6 atoms)Diazo ring (6 atoms)Oxidized enzyme0.1250.0400.0300.0110.0100.021Reduced enzyme0.1470.0490.0330.0140.0090.025 Open table in a new tab Within the region of the active site of oxidized MDH-GOX2, there are seven interior water molecules that form three separate groups (Fig. 6). One group (Wat97 and Wat153) connects Tyr26 Oη to Gly81 O; the second group (Wat142, Wat196, and Wat169) connects Tyr26 Oη to Tyr131 Oη; the waters in the third group (Wat110 and Wat375) are bound to the O-2 atom of sulfate. One of these (Wat375) is also bound to Arg165 Nη-2, and the other (Wat110) is linked to a network of waters leading to bulk solvent. In the reduced form of the enzyme one of these seven waters (Wat153) is absent, and the other six exhibit movements of 0.45 Å or greater (Fig. 6 and Table III).Table IIIActive site water molecules and their movement upon reductionWaterDistanceBox (A2)Bred (A2)970.4522241100.4535521420.782928153Missing261690.6638361960.4932253750.63425020.031213120.081313 Open table in a new tab Affinity of Reduced MDH for the Product, Benzoylformate—Under anaerobic conditions, MDH is capable of catalyzing the reverse reaction, the reoxidation of reduced enzyme by benzoylformate (27Dewanti A. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12893-12901Google Scholar). The kinetic constants for the reverse reaction were determined by measuring increases in absorbance at 460 nm at 20 °C for different benzoylformate concentrations. The data were fit to a two-exponential equation in the time range 2-60 ms. The smaller rate constant together with its amplitude accounted for ∼10% of the data. This small rate constant may arise from a small population of enzyme that has low activity. Alternatively, it could describe the approach to equilibrium between (S)-mandelate and benzoylformate, because both forward and reverse rates are comparable. Fig. 7 shows a plot of the two rate constants, k1 and k2, as a function of the product concentration. The rate of the reverse reaction at saturating benzoylformate concentration was 313 ± 27 s-1, and the Kd for benzoylformate was 6.7 ± 1.8 mm (Table IV). In contrast for the forward reaction, the reduction of wtMDH by (S)-mandelate, the corresponding values were 402 ± 16 s-1 and 0.19 ± 0.03 mm (28Xu Y. Dewanti A.R. Mitra B.

Open table in a new tab Sulfate Binding in the Oxidized and Reduced Enzyme—The active site of oxidized MDH is optimized for binding a negatively charged substrate. The affinity of wtMDH for (S)-mandelate is 0.2 mm (28Xu Y. Dewanti A.R. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12313-12319Google Scholar). Therefore, it is expected that the negatively charged sulfate ion would be bound to the active site of the oxidized enzyme. In contrast, the presence of the sulfate anion in the mandelate-reduced structure of MDH-GOX2 was contrary to the expectation that mandelate or its oxidation product would become bound, replacing the sulfate anion. However, the kinetic studies of MDH reported here reveal that the ketoacid product binds very weakly to the reduced enzyme, compared with α-hydroxy acid binding to the oxidized enzyme (Fig. 7 and Table IV). Measurement of the affinity of mandelate to the reduced enzyme is difficult because the perturbation of the reduced spectrum of MDH on addition of mandelate is small. We expect the reduced enzyme not to bind (S)-mandelate tightly. MDH follows a ping-pong mechanism, where the first product, benzoylformate, must leave the active site before reoxidation can occur (13Lehoux I.E. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5836-5848Google Scholar). The physiological role of MDH is to catalyze the conversion of (S)-mandelate to benzoylformate. Therefore, tight binding of (S)-mandelate, which resembles the product in both structure and charge, to the reduced enzyme would result in its inefficient reoxidation. The presence of sulfate in both oxidized and reduced enzyme crystals implies that the sulfate is first displaced by substrate during formation of the Michaelis complex in the forward reaction; after flavin reduction occurs, the weakly bound product is then displaced by another sulfate anion present in solution. The average B factor for the sulfate anion is about 32 and 23 Å2 in the oxidized and reduced enzymes, respectively; these B factors are consistent with binding at a level that could allow displacement and rebinding during the reactions. Movement of Water Upon Enzyme Reduction—In the reduced form of MDH the flavin ring could exist in either of two states, the neutral hydroquinone with protons located at positions N-1, N-3, and N-5 and the anionic hydroquinone in which the proton on N-1 has dissociated (29Muller F. Muller, F Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-71Google Scholar). In free flavin hydroquinone, the pKa for dissociation of the N-1 proton is 6.7, a value close to the pH at which the crystals of MDH-GOX2 are grown, pH 6.2. However, in the α-hydroxy acid oxidizing enzymes FCB2, GOX, and lactate oxidase, the anionic forms of reduced and semiquinone flavin are believed to be stabilized with respect to the neutral form by the presence of a protonated lysine (equivalent to Lys231 in MDH) near the N-1/O-2 locus of the flavin (4Lederer F. Muller, F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Flavoenzymes. Vol. 2. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 153-242Google Scholar, 6Ghisla S. Massey V. Muller, F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Flavoenzymes. Vol. 2. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 243-289Google Scholar). Spectra of the substrate-reduced forms of both wtMDH and MDH-GOX2 show that they also preferentially stabilize the anionic hydroquinone (13Lehoux I.E. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5836-5848Google Scholar, 16Xu Y. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12367-12376Google Scholar). The structure of reduced MDH-GOX2 is consistent with the presence of the anionic form of the hydroquinone because, like the oxidized form, the N-1 is a hydrogen bond acceptor from Lys231, and no other functional group is located close enough to be a hydrogen bond acceptor (Fig. 4). The absence of Wat153 and movement of six active site waters in reduced MDH-GOX2 are highly significant. Only 6 of the 400 waters of the oxidized enzyme are lost upon reduction, and 5 of them are located on the outer surface of the protein. Of the remaining 394 water molecules common to both oxidation states, 48 (about 12%) differ in position by 0.40 Å or greater. Forty two of these are located in the first hydration shell where they interact with the protein and with other water molecules, or in the second hydration shell where they interact only with other waters. The six remaining waters are at the active site in the protein interior as described above. The waters in the first or second hydration shell are very mobile, unlike those in the active site, and can move freely. The largest movement found for a water tightly bound in a surface depression is 0.32 Å. Many waters, as for example two water molecules (Wat2 and Wat12) that lie near the phosphate tail of FMN, move less than 0.1 Å (Table III). In the oxidized crystal Tyr26 Oη donates a hydrogen bond to Wat142 but not to Gly81 O and accepts a hydrogen bond from Wat153 (Figs. 6 and 8A). Wat153 also donates to Wat97 which donates to Asn83 Oδ-1 and Gly81 O. On the other side of Tyr26, Wat142 donates hydrogen bonds to Wat196 and O-3 of sulfate, and Wat196 donates hydrogen bonds to O-4 and N-5 of the flavin ring that are 2.8 and 3.3 Å away, respectively. Finally, Wat169 donates hydrogen bonds to Wat196 and O-1 of sulfate and accepts a hydrogen bond from Tyr131 Oη. In the reduced crystal, Wat153 is expelled and the side chain of Tyr26 rotates 10° in the direction of Tyr131 (moving 0.8 Å closer) so that it now donates a H-bond to Gly81 O and accepts one from Wat142 (Figs. 6 and 8B). This movement is accompanied by a concerted shift of Wat142, Wat196, and Wat169 in the general direction of Tyr131. Because Wat142 and Wat169 make hydrogen bonds to sulfate O-1 and O-3, respectively, this movement induces a small movement of the sulfate anion (0.23 Å) that appears to be responsible for the somewhat larger movements of Wat110 and Wat375. Wat97 moves toward the vacant Wat153 site, while maintaining its hydrogen bonds to Gly81 O and Asn83 Oδ-1. In view of the limited conformational change occurring in MDH-GOX2 upon reduction, how is flavin reduction related to the loss of Wat153 and movement of Tyr26? An analysis of the inventory and distribution of protons on the five active site waters linking Tyr26 to Tyr131 indicates that in both the oxidized and reduced enzymes (Figs. 6 and 8), Tyr131 must donate its Oη proton to Wat169 as there is no other hydrogen bond acceptor close enough. Wat169 in turn must donate one proton to O-3 of the sulfate anion and its other proton to Wat196. Thus, in the vicinity of Tyr131, the hydrogen bonding direction and network remain relatively unaltered in the reduced enzyme. In contrast, the change of the N-5 of the flavin from an imide to a protonated amide in the reduced enzyme appears to trigger a reorientation in the hydrogen-bonding pattern of the water network in the direction of Tyr26 (Fig. 8B) (29Muller F. Muller, F Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-71Google Scholar). The N-5 proton on the reduced flavin can now act as a proton donor to form a hydrogen bond with Wat196. Because Wat196 continues to receive a hydrogen bond from Wat169 as in the oxidized enzyme, it now has to donate one proton to Wat142 while the other proton is still hydrogen-bonded to O-4 of flavin. In turn, Wat142 must now donate a hydrogen bond to Tyr26 Oη, while its other proton will still be donated to O-1 of sulfate. Tyr26 moves closer to Wat142 and can now form a new hydrogen bond with Gly81 O by donating its Oη proton to Gly81 O. This results in an expulsion of Wat153. It is also expected that the hydrogen bond from the amide NH of Gly81 to the amide N-5 of the reduced flavin is stronger than the one to the imide N-5 of the oxidized flavin. These subtle changes lead to a more rigid structure on the re face of flavin in the reduced enzyme. Physiological Role of Water Rearrangement—What is the physiological role of the observed water rearrangement within MDH following the reductive half-reaction? One role may be to facilitate proton removal from the flavin during the second part of the oxidative half-reaction. Like FCB2, reduced MDH appears to be reoxidized in two 1-electron transfer events to an organic electron acceptor molecule such as ubiquinone. During the first electron transfer step no proton loss from FMN needs to occur because the anionic flavin semiquinone is likely to be stabilized by the same mechanism as the anionic hydroquinone. In fact, MDH is found to stabilize the anionic form of the semiquinone. 2A. R. Dewanti and B. Mitra, unpublished observations. However, during the second electron transfer to yield the oxidized quinone form of FMN, the flavin ring would need to give up a proton. If the hydrogen bonding rearrangement and water loss observed on flavin reduction (Fig. 8) were reversed concomitant with this second electron transfer step, it would provide a pathway for delivery of the released proton to bulk water or some other unknown proton acceptor. Another role of the water rearrangement following flavin reduction may be in controlling reactivity to molecular oxygen. In the reduced enzyme the backbone of Gly81 is more rigidly fixed in configuration than in the oxidized enzyme because of the additional hydrogen bond with Tyr26 Oη (2.7 Å). This may be correlated with the very low reactivity of MDH-GOX2 with oxygen (15Xu Y. Mitra B. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Rudolf Weber, Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 487-490Google Scholar). In GOX, which reacts readily with molecular oxygen in the reduced state, the flavin ring is tilted by ∼20° from its position in MDH-GOX2 (17Sukumar N. Xu Y. Gatti D.L. Mitra B. Mathews F.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9870-9878Google Scholar) and in FCB2 (30Lindqvist Y. Branden C.I. Mathews F.S. Lederer F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3198-3207Google Scholar) which also reacts slowly with dioxygen. This results in a breaking of hydrogen bonds in GOX between the residues equivalent to Gly81 N and Ser108 Oγ of MDH and flavin N-5 and O-4, respectively, which instead are now formed to a water molecule that fills a void left by the displaced flavin atoms. Furthermore, the backbone chain near the residue equivalent to Gly81 in MDH is in a different configuration in GOX than it is in MDH-GOX2 and FCB2, and there is no equivalent hydrogen bond from the amide nitrogen of the Gly81 to flavin N-5. The decreased flexibility of Gly81 in the reduced enzyme may prevent changes in conformation in MDH that could lead to facile reoxidation of the reduced flavin by molecular oxygen. Oxidation by molecular oxygen most likely proceeds through the formation of a flavin 4a-hydroperoxide intermediate (31Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22459-22462Google Scholar); a constrained active site may prevent the formation of this intermediate. The possible importance of Gly81 in maintaining limited oxygen reactivity is indicated by the Gly81 to Ala mutation that leads to about a 10-fold increase in the rate of oxidation (15Xu Y. Mitra B. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Rudolf Weber, Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 487-490Google Scholar). Additionally, solvation of the superoxide anion is important in the reaction with oxygen, because the redox potential of the O2/O2- couple is strongly solvent-dependent (32Sawyer D.T. Nanni E.J. Sawyer D.T. Nanni E.J. Oxygen and Oxy-Radicals in Chemistry and Biology. Academic Press, New York1981: 15-44Google Scholar). The decreased solvation of the active site in the reduced enzyme may prevent the facile formation of the superoxide anion. In conclusion, a subtle rearrangement of the hydrogen-bonded water network in the active site together with the loss of one water molecule may play an important role in facilitating reoxidation of the reduced flavin by 1-electron transfers to a suitable acceptor, while discouraging reactivity toward oxygen.

Three L-complex proteins contain zinc finger motifs that could be involved in these interactions. In Leishmania these proteins are labeled LC-1, LC-4, and LC-7b, and the orthologs in Trypanosoma brucei are labeled MP81, MP63, and MP42. Overexpression of TAP-tagged LC-4 in Leishmania tarentolae led to a partial localization of the protein in the L-complex together with the endogenous LC-4 protein, suggesting at least a dimeric organization. Disruption of zinc fingers 1 or 2 (ZnF-1 and ZnF-2) in the tagged LC-4 protein was performed by mutation of the two zinc-binding cysteines to glycines. Disruption of ZnF-1 led to a partial growth defect and a substantive breakdown of the L-complex, whereas disruption of ZnF-2 had no effect on cell growth and caused a partial breakdown of the L-complex. A close interaction of LC-4 with 2–4 proteins, including REL1 (RNA ligase) and LC-3, was suggested by chemical crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation experiments.

The classical C2H2 zinc finger motifs are found in many regulatory proteins (12Klug A. Schwabe J.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Zinc finger motifs interact with DNA and RNA and with proteins. C2H2 zinc finger proteins can be divided into three groups based on the number and pattern of the fingers, namely triple C2H2, multiple-adjacent C2H2, and separated-paired C2H2. LC-4 belongs to the latter group, in which each finger pair behaves independently in the binding reaction (13Iuchi S. Cell. Mol.

The PCR product was inserted into the BamHI site of the pX-derived p26 (MRP1)-TAP vector (9Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Simpson L.

(New England Biolabs) (9Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Simpson L. RNA. 2003; 9: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 of ∼0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the cells were incubated at 15 °C overnight. Amylose resin (New England Biolabs) was used for affinity isolation of the recombinant fusion protein. After elution from the column with 10 mm maltose, LC-4-MBP was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the protein band was excised and used for generation of polyclonal antibodies in mice (Covance Inc.). The LC-2 gene was amplified from L. major genomic DNA (2Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L.

The gene was sub-cloned into the pET15b vector (Novagen) using NdeI and BamHI and expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal His6 tag. The LC-3 formed inclusion bodies in E. coli and was purified under denaturing conditions by metal affinity chromatography on Talon resin (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant LC-3 (Covance Inc.). The L. major REL1 gene was identified in the GenBank™ data base using the T. brucei REL1 sequence (CAB95523) (14Schnaufer A. Panigrahi A.K. Panicucci B. Igo R.P. Salavati R. Stuart K. Science. 2001; 291: 2159-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides from conserved regions of the L. major REL1 gene were used to amplify fragments of the L. tarentolae ortholog (5′-primer, 5′-GAGAAGGTGCACGGCACAAACTT-3′; and 3′-primer, 5′-GGCCGATCTTCGACAGCACGT-3′).

This PCR product was inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pGAD T7 expression vector (Clontech). LC-4 Zinc Finger Mutations—The QuikChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used for the mutation of the two zinc fingers of LC-4 in the LC-4-TAP vector. The following oligonucleotides were 5′-phosphorylated and simultaneously used in mutagenesis reactions: 5′-CGTTTCCACgGCAGCGTTgGCAAGAAGTCG-3′; 5′-CGCATGTAgGCATCGTTGgCGAGAAGAAC-3′ (T to G substitutions are indicated by a lowercase g). Colonies were selected and screened for the desired mutations. Cell Transfection—L. tarentolae cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in electroporation buffer (21 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm NaH2PO4), and resuspended at a density of 100 × 106 cells/ml. DNA (10 μg) was added to 400-μl cells in an electroporation cuvette (BTX; 2-mm gap), and the cells were incubated on ice for 10 min. After electroporation (BTX, Electro Cell Manipulator 600) using conditions described previously (15Coburn C.M. Otteman K.M. McNeely T. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the cells were cooled on ice, transferred into brain heart infusion medium, and incubated overnight at 27 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and plated onto brain heart infusion agar plates containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Glycerol Gradient Fractionation and Adenylation—Freshly isolated mitochondria (100 mg wet weight) were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.1, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing Complete proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After sonicating for 3 s, the mixture was centrifuged at 90,000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman Optima centrifuge. The supernatant was loaded on a glycerol gradient (10–30% glycerol) and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 20 h in the SW41 rotor. Fractions of 750 μl were collected from the top using an Isco density gradient fractionator. For adenylation of REL1, 0.5 μl of [α-32P]ATP were added to 10 μl of each fraction, and the aliquots were incubated for 30 min at 27 °C. REL2 is pre-charged with AMP and, therefore, does not adenylate well in this reaction (16Cruz-Reyes J. Rusche L. Piller K.J. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Chemical Crosslinking—Mitochondrial extract was fractionated on a glycerol gradient, the 20 S fraction was incubated with [α-32P]ATP to label REL1, and then dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) (Pierce) or formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 10 mm or 0.1–0.5%, respectively. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer to a membrane and PhosphorImager analysis, the membrane with the formaldehyde-crosslinked proteins was subjected to Western analysis using the LC-4 polyclonal antiserum. The low amount of protein crosslinked by DMS precluded Western analysis of that blot. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—ReadyStrip IPG strips (Bio-Rad) were used for isoelectric focusing separation. Samples were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and prepared in rehydration sample buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Bio-Lyte ampholytes (Bio-Rad)) and loaded into the rehydration/equilibration tray. Strips were placed gel side down onto the sample and overlaid with 1 ml of mineral oil to prevent evaporation during the rehydration process. The tray was covered and placed into the PROTEAN IEF cell (Bio-Rad) at 20 °C overnight to rehydrate the IPG strips and load the protein sample. After rehydration, a wet paper wick was placed at both ends of the channels covering the wire electrodes, and the IPG strips were transferred into the focusing tray (gel side down) and covered with 1 ml of mineral oil. The focusing tray was then placed into the PROTEAN IEF cell (Bio-Rad) for focusing (250 V for 15 min, linear ramping to 4000 V for 2 h, and 12,000–20,000 V for 20 h). Prior to running the second dimension, the IPG strips were equilibrated in SDS-PAGE equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 0.375 m Tris, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 20 glycerol, and 2% dithiothreitol) for 10 min and then loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel for the second dimension. Protein Sequencing—Mass spectrometric analysis of proteins was performed as described in detail previously (2Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the protein spots of interest were excised and digested with trypsin in situ. The recovered peptides were purified using νC18 ZipTips (Millipore). Mass spectrometric measurements were performed on an Applied Biosystems 4700 proteomics analyzer, which is a tandem time-of-flight instrument (TOF/TOF) with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) ion source (17Bienvenut W.V. Deon C. Pasquarello C. Campbell J.M. Sanchez J.C. Vestal M.L. Hochstrasser D.F. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences were determined by manual interpretation of the MS/MS spectra. The inferred sequences were searched using Protein Prospector (University of California, San Francisco) against the NCBInr data base as well as the parasite genome databases (www.genedb.org). Co-Immunoprecipitation of LC-4, LC-3, and REL1—The L. tarentolae LC-4 gene was excised from the pMal-c2X construct with SalI and EcoRI, and the fragment was inserted into the pGBK T7 expression vector (Clontech). L. tarentolae REL1 was cloned in the pGAD T7 expression vector, and the L. major LC-3 gene was cloned in the PET15b T7 expression vector as described above. Each plasmid was transcribed and translated using the TnT coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The LC-3 and REL1 proteins were labeled by inclusion of [35S]methionine (Easytag express protein labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the reaction mix. The reactions were clarified for 30 min in the Microfuge, and 10 μl of each were mixed together and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Then, 5 μl of LC-4 antiserum was added, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. After clarification, protein G beads (γ-binding, G-Sepharose; Amersham Biosciences) were added and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. The beads were pelleted, washed multiple times in 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m EDTA (pH 7) with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the bound protein was released by boiling with SDS loading buffer for gel electrophoresis. Overexpression of TAP-tagged LC-4 Protein in L. tarentolae— The LC-4 protein (the ortholog in T. brucei is MP63) is a component of the ∼16 polypeptide L-complex (7Simpson L. Aphasizhev R. Gao G. Kang X. RNA. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The L. tarentolae LC-4 gene was inserted into the pX expression vector (18LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) as a fusion with the calmodulin-binding and protein A motifs (TAP tag) (19Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar), and the plasmid was used to transfect L. tarentolae cells. The majority of the tagged LC-4 protein was targeted to the mitochondrion (Fig. 1A). Mitochondrial extract from transfected cells was fractionated on a glycerol gradient, and the 10 S fractions and the 20 S fractions were subjected to the tandem affinity isolation procedure (19Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The polypeptide profiles for the TAP-isolated 10 and 20 S material were the same (Fig. 1B) and essentially identical to that reported previously for the LC-4-TAP isolation from total mitochondrial extract (2Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The gel was blotted and Western analysis performed. As shown in Fig. 1B, the tagged LC-4 protein was relatively more abundant than the endogenous LC-4 in the TAP pulldowns from both the 20 S fractions and the 10 S fractions. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis of the LC-4-TAP Purified L-complex—The TAP isolation procedure involves two affinity purification steps. In the first step, the C-terminal protein moiety of the LC-4-TAP is bound to an IgG matrix and then eluted after digestion with TEV protease, which cleaves between the protein A motif and the calmodulin binding peptide. The second step involves binding to calmodulin agarose and elution with EGTA. Both the TEV-released and the EGTA-released materials were fractionated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2, ∼15–20 spots can be detected using the TEV-released material. The REL1 spot was identified by adenylation, and the LC-4 and tagged LC-4 spots were identified by Western analysis (Fig. 2C). At least four proteins from the TEV-released material (circled in Fig. 2A) are missing in the EGTA-released material (Fig. 2B). A control experiment using a plasmid containing only the mitochondrial target signal fused to the TAP tag yielded only the expected IgG heavy and light chain contaminants in the TEV-released material (not shown). Very similar two-dimensional gel patterns, including the four spots present in the TEV-released material and absent in the EGTA-released material, were obtained using LC-2-TAP isolated material (not shown). The spot labeled LC-3 in Fig. 2 (but obtained from the LC-2-TAP pull-down) was excised, subjected to tryptic digestion, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Three peptides were obtained (EEHNAAAPSAAQNLLR, GHTLPAGAAADITQTR, and (AL)SGAHVGLPAGNRPTPH) (the parenthesis around AL indicates that their order was not determined by MS/MS), which all mapped to the L. major LC-3 protein sequence. We also analyzed one of the spots (* in Fig. 2A) present only in the TEV-released material. Three tryptic peptides were obtained (FTEVGFHGR, HQVPSDIREEIAPK, (VL)EEISFEGPER), which mapped to an L. major protein (LmjF15.0090) with an “AAA” PFAM domain that contains an ATP-binding site. It is possible that this and the other three unidentified proteins represent L-complex components that are less tightly bound and lost during the calmodulin binding step or that they are merely contaminants. The former possibility is consistent with the fact that sub-stoichiometric amounts of associated RET1 and MRP1/2 are greater in the TEV-released material than in the final calmodulin-released material (2Aphasizhev R.

Chemical Crosslinking of L-complex Proteins to LC-4 and Co-Immunoprecipitation Evidence for Interaction of LC-4, LC-3, and REL1—Proteins interacting with LC-4 were detected by chemical crosslinking of the 20 S L-complex gradient fraction and also by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-LC-4 antiserum. As shown in Fig. 3A, several crosslinks are visible in the LC-4 Western blot of the formaldehyde-crosslinked material. The second crosslink from the bottom (Fig. 3A, left panel side) was identified as REL1 by correspondence with the major adenylated band. There is a third crosslink after REL1. A similar pattern of crosslinking was seen using DMS in Fig. 3B. In this experiment, the extent of crosslinking was too low to allow Western analysis, but crosslinking of the adenylated REL1 in the DMS+ lane is clear. Direct evidence for interactions of LC-4 and LC-3 and LC-4 and REL1 was obtained by co-immunoprecipitation. The TnT coupled transcription/translation system was used to obtain 35S-labeled LC-3 and REL1 and unlabeled LC-4 proteins, which were used in this experiment. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the unlabeled LC-4 protein and the labeled LC-3 or REL1 proteins were incubated together, and then the LC-4 antibody was added, followed by protein G-Sepharose beads. The proteins bound to the beads were separated in an SDS gel, which was blotted, and the blot was stained and exposed to the PhosphorImager to detect the labeled protein. As shown in Fig. 4A, labeled LC-3 protein was only co-immunoprecipitated with anti-LC-4 antibody when unlabeled LC-4 was also present, indicating an interaction of LC-4 and LC-3. Similar results showing an interaction of LC-4 and REL1 are shown in Fig. 4B. These results confirm our previous identification of a subcomplex apparently containing LC-4, LC-3, and REL1, which was detected after overexpression of REL1-TAP in L. tarentolae (2Aphasizhev R.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and also the co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid results in the T. brucei system (20Schnaufer A. Ernst N.L. Palazzo S.S. O'Rear J. Salavati R. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These data do not eliminate the possibility that there may be additional proteins associated with the REL1 subcomplex. Effect of Mutagenesis of the Two Zinc Fingers in the LC-4-TAP Protein on Cell Growth—The location of the two C2H2 zinc fingers is shown in the alignment of the LC-4 proteins from L. major, L. tarentolae, and the MP63 homologue from T. brucei (Fig. 5). The plasmid-encoded L. tarentolae LC-4-TAP protein was mutagenized by changing the two metal-binding cysteines to glycines in each motif. Cells were transfected and clonal lines selected that expressed the mutated tagged LC-4 proteins. As shown in Fig. 6, the ZnF-1 mutation was not lethal but did produce an increase in the cell division time from 6 to 8 h. The ZnF-2 mutants showed no change in growth as compared with wild type cells.Fig. 6Growth curves of wt cells, ZnF-1 mutants, and ZnF-2 mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ZnF-2 Mutation Causes a Partial Breakdown of the L-complex, and the ZnF-1 Mutation Causes a Major Disruption of the L-complex—Glycerol gradient sedimentation of mitochondrial extract from wt cells (Fig. 7, panels 1–4) and ZnF-2 mutant cells (Fig. 7, panels 5–8) showed that the wt LC-4-TAP protein was incorporated mainly into the 10 S L-complex but also into the 20 S L-complex as defined by the presence of the adenylated REL1 and REL2 ligase markers. Almost all of the untagged LC-4 was present in the 20 S L-complex in an ∼1:1 ratio with the LC-4-TAP protein. The ZnF-2 mutation caused a partial breakdown of the REL1-containing 20 S L-complex into the 10 S L-complex and possibly a slight decrease in the Svedberg value of the remaining larger L-complex. This minor perturbation of the structure of the L-complex is consistent with the absence of a cell growth phenotype. TAP isolation of the TAP-tagged LC-4 and associated proteins from the 10 and 20 S gradient fractions from ZnF-2 mutant cells yielded polypeptide profiles identical to that obtained with wt cells. The relative abundance of tagged and endogenous LC-4 proteins in both fractions (not shown) was also very similar to that of wt cells in Fig. 1B (data not shown). Glycerol gradient sedimentation of mitochondrial extract from ZnF-1 cells indicated a major disruption of the L-complex in that the adenylated REL1 marker ligase sedimented in the 5–10 S region (Fig. 8, panel 2); in addition, the relative amount of LC-4-containing complexes decreased at least 1000-fold, and the LC-4-TAP decreased to below detection levels even using the femto-substrate for Western analysis (Fig. 8, panel 1). The remaining LC-4 containing material showed a broad distribution in the 5–10 S region and also a peak sedimenting several fractions slower than the 20 S L-complex peak obtained with the wt and LC-4 TAP cells, possibly suggesting a loss of the REL1 subcomplex prior to complete disruption. The LC-4 (MP63) L-complex protein is one of three related L-complex proteins containing zinc finger motifs (2Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5Panigrahi A.K. Schnaufer A. Carmean N. Igo Jr., R.P. Gygi S.P. Ernst N.L. Palazzo S.S. Weston D.S. Aebersold R. Salavati R. Stuart K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6833-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). LC-4 has been shown previously to form a subcomplex with REL1 and LC-3 (2Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Schnaufer A. Ernst N.L. Palazzo S.S. O'Rear J. Salavati R. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the coimmunoprecipitation and chemical crosslinking results in this paper support this conclusion. Our crosslinking analysis also suggests that there may be a third, yet unidentified protein interacting with LC-4 in addition to REL1 and LC-3. TAP-tagged LC-4 expressed from a plasmid was targeted to the mitochondrion and partially incorporated into the 20 S L-complex. ∼80% of the LC-4-TAP protein was incorporated into a 10 S complex that also contained the REL1 ligase marker and was associated with the same set of proteins as the LC-4-TAP in the 20 S region. The endogenous LC-4 protein was found almost entirely in the 20 S L-complex in wt cells (21Gao G. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27570-27574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and in the LC-4-TAP cells, but ∼30% of endogenous LC-4 appeared in the 10 S region in the LC-4-TAP-ZnF-2 mutant cells. The simplest explanation for these results is that there is a 20 S dimer that breaks down into a 10 S monomer due to the incorporation of the ZnF-2 mutated LC-4 into the complex. This model is consistent with the evidence that TAP-isolation of the 10 S gradient fractions yielded the same polypeptide profile as from the 20 S fractions. Also, the presence of the endogenous LC-4 in the TAP-isolated material suggests that at least two copies of LC-4 are present in the 20 S complex. However, the fact that the ratio of LC-4-TAP and endogenous LC-4 in the 20 S L-complex region was ∼1:1, whereas the ratio in the TAP-isolated 20 S L-complex was ∼9:1, suggests that the incorporation of the LC-4-TAP protein into the L-complex specifically affects dimer formation with the wt L-complex. It is clear that the dimer-monomer model is suggestive but not conclusive and that the precise quaternary structure of the L-complex remains to be determined. In any case, the LC-4 protein appears to play a major role in determining the stability of the 20 S L-complex. Similar conclusions were reached by Huang et al. in 2002 (11Huang C.E. O'Hearn S.F. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3194-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), who showed that conditional RNA interference down-regulation of TbMP63 (=Band III) expression is lethal and causes a disruption of the L-complex. It has been speculated that the three related zinc finger proteins in the L-complex serve a structural role in interacting with other proteins or with RNA (5Panigrahi A.K. Schnaufer A. Carmean N. Igo Jr., R.P. Gygi S.P. Ernst N.L. Palazzo S.S. Weston D.S. Aebersold R. Salavati R. Stuart K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6833-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that both zinc finger motifs in LC-4 are functional in stabilizing the L-complex. Disruption of ZnF-1 produced a growth defect and an almost complete breakdown of the L-complex, and disruption of ZnF-2 showed no phenotype but did produce a partial disruption of the L-complex. It is tempting to speculate that ZnF-1 is involved with stability of the entire L-complex and that ZnF-2 is involved with dimerization, but further work must be performed to substantiate this. Our data indicates that these two motifs are at least involved in protein-protein interactions, but an additional role in RNA binding cannot be ruled out.

https://openalex.org/W1991632555,"Current methods to detect protein-protein interactions are either laborious to implement or not adaptable for mammalian systems or in vitro methods. By adding a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS) onto one protein, binding partners lacking a targeting signal were co-transported into the peroxisomes in a piggy-back fashion, as visualized by confocal and electron microscopy. A fragment of colicin E2 and its tightly interacting immunity protein, ImmE2, were both expressed in the cytosol. When either one contained a PTS tag, both proteins were co-localized in the peroxisomes. The cytokine-independent survival kinase (CISK) containing a PTS tag was not efficiently targeted to the peroxisomes unless the Phox homology (PX) domain, attaching the protein to endosomal membranes, was removed. However, PTS-tagged CISK with deleted PX domain was able to direct 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) into the peroxisomes. This demonstrates that the two proteins interact in vivo. Mutating Ser486, which is phosphorylated in activated CISK, to Ala prevented the interaction, indicating that CISK and PDK-1 interact in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The method therefore allows assessment of protein-protein interactions that depend on post-translational modifications that are cell-specific or dependent on the physiological state of the cell."
