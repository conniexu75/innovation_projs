A concentration of 0.01 per cent of indole, for example, killed all organisms in a vigorous culture in two hours, but these workers made no mention of any characteristic change in appearance of the cells. We have now shown that these substances are highly toxic to the anaerobic ciliates of the sheep's rumen, particularly the holotrichs (Isotricha and Dasytricha) and also Ophryoscolex. These ciliates had been separated from strained rumen contents, washed and maintained alive and active for several hours in a phosphate buffer (without antibiotic) at pH 7.2 as described by Heald, Sugden and Oxford2. On a molecular basis skatole was much more toxic than indole to the rumen ciliates; but if the comparison was made at concentrations near saturation in the buffer employed, indole being the more soluble compound, the respective effects upon the final appearance of the cells were almost equally spectacular. Briefly, not only did all ciliary motion cease in two hours at 37°, but also a phenomenon resembling a drastic mechanical disintegration took place. The outer pellicles of the holotrichs, and also of Ophryoscolex, were torn asunder with liberation of the internal contents of the cells, so that after gently shaking the tube, instead of the rapid re-formation of a layer of ciliates at the bottom below a clear supernatant, there was a dense uniform turbidity throughout due to the release of storage polysaccharide granules and other inclusions from the disrupted cells."

Properly heated meals absorbed or reacted with significantly more phenolphthalein than under-heated samples, and over-heated samples somewhat more than the properly heated ones."

This condition was called ‘the Utrecht abnormality of milk’, for it appeared first in the province of Utrecht. Afterwards this abnormality was found in other parts of the country as well1. The abnormality disappeared gradually; at present it is quite rare."

In our experiments, transfers of ova have been carried out between the Border Leicester (mature weight 140–180 lb.) and Welsh Mountain (mature weight 80–100 lb.) breeds in order to evaluate the maternal influence on the size of lambs at birth and at subsequent ages."

Since other methods described for the determination of calcium and magnesium are rather laborious, and micro-scale determination is liable to large errors, we have tried the direct titration with ethylene-diamine tetraacetate using the well-known Linder-strøm–Lang micro-titration technique. Determinations have been carried out on some species of Blattaria: Periplaneta americana, Periplaneta australasiae and Blabera fusca."

https://openalex.org/W2015715704,"PREVIOUS work1 has shown that after intravenous injection of colloidal 3 : 4 benzpyrene the bulk of the carcinogen is held in the liver. Excretion takes place over approximately twenty-four hours, the hydrocarbon having undergone metabolic oxidation to one or other of two compounds labelled BpX 1 or BpX 2. These are oxidation products and have been characterized by physical methods and analogy with known derivatives of other polycyclic hydrocarbons as being: 8(OR 1) − 9(OH) − 8,9 dihydro 3 : 4 benzpyrene and 8(OR 1) − 9(OR 2) − 8,9 dihydro benzpyrene respectively. The groups R 1 and R 2 are, at present, unidentified radicals. It has also been found1,2 that during metabolic oxidation the products derived from 3 : 4 benzpyrene are firmly bound within the tissues where they are formed."

It was found that iodinated casein proved beneficial in improving libido and fertility in inactive bulls. It has also been found to overcome ‘summer sterility’ in rams2. So far, little work has been carried out to investigate the effect of thyroxine on the various reproductive processes in the ewe."
