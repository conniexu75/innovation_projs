https://openalex.org/W2772625411,"The food demands of the United States (US) impart significant environmental pressures. The high rate of consumption of beef has been shown to be the largest driver of food-borne greenhouse gas emissions, water use and land occupation in the US diet. The environmental benefits of substituting animal products with vegetal foods are well documented, but significant psychological barriers persist in reducing meat consumption. Here we use life cycle assessment to appraise the environmental performance of a novel vegetal protein source in the mean US diet where it replaces ground beef, and in vegetarian and vegan diets where it substitutes for legumes, tofu and other protein sources. We find that relative to the mean US diet, vegetarian and vegan diets significantly reduce per-capita food-borne greenhouse gas emission (32% and 67%, respectively), blue water use (70% and 75%, respectively) and land occupation (70% and 79%, respectively), primarily in the form of rangeland. The substitution of 10%, 25% and 50% of ground beef with plant-based burger (PBB) at the national scale results in substantial reductions in annual US dietary greenhouse gas emissions (4.55–45.42 Mt CO2 equivalents), water consumption (1.30–12.00 km3) and land occupation (22300–190100 km2). Despite PBB’s elevated environmental pressures compared to other vegetal protein sources, we demonstrate that minimal risk exists for the disservices of PBB substitution in non-meat diets to outweigh the benefits of ground-beef substitution in the omnivorous American diet. Demand for plant-based oils in PBB production has the potential to increase land use pressures in biodiversity hotspots, though these could be obviated through responsible land stewardship. Although the apparent environmental benefits of the PBB are contingent on actual uptake of the product, this study demonstrates the potential for non-traditional protein substitutes to play a role in a transition towards more sustainable consumption regimes in the US and potentially abroad."
https://openalex.org/W2775714903,"Conflicting reports regarding whether high tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) are associated with outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) exist. Previous investigators have counted TAN using non-neutrophil-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains. We examined whether TAN levels as determined by multi-field manual counting would predict prognosis. IRB approval was obtained and two pathologists, blinded to stage/outcome, counted TAN in 20 high power fields (HPF) per specimen. TAN score was defined as the mean of these counts. High TAN was defined as at or greater than the median score for that stage. Demographics, tumor characteristics, and overall survival (OS) were obtained from the records and examined for association with TAN score. IHC for arginase expression was performed in a subset of samples. 221 patients were included. Stage II patients with high TAN scores had an OS of 232 months as compared to those with low TAN (OS = 85 months, p = 0.03). The survival benefit persisted in multivariable analysis (HR 0.48, CI 0.25–0.91, p = 0.026) controlling for age and sex. Women had increased survival as compared to men, and there were no significant prognostic associations with TAN count in stage III/IV patients, although there were only 12 stage IV patients. Arginase staining did not provide additional information. Stage II colorectal cancer patients with high TAN live nearly 3 times longer than those with low TAN. Women with stage II disease and high TAN counts appear to be driving the survival benefit seen in the stage II patients and have increased overall survival in all stages."
https://openalex.org/W2774091828,"Relaxation and excitation are components of the effects of music listening. The tempo of music is often considered a critical factor when determining these effects: listening to slow-tempo and fast-tempo music elicits relaxation and excitation, respectively. However, the chemical bases that underlie these relaxation and excitation effects remain unclear. Since parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve activities are facilitated by oxytocin and glucocorticoid, respectively, we hypothesized that listening to relaxing slow-tempo and exciting fast-tempo music is accompanied by increases in the oxytocin and cortisol levels, respectively. We evaluated the change in the salivary oxytocin and cortisol levels of participants listening to slow-tempo and fast-tempo music sequences. We measured the heart rate (HR) and calculated the heart rate variability (HRV) to evaluate the strength of autonomic nerve activity. After listening to a music sequence, the participants rated their arousal and valence levels. We found that both the salivary oxytocin concentration and the high frequency component of the HRV (HF) increased and the HR decreased when a slow-tempo music sequence was presented. The salivary cortisol level decreased and the low frequency of the HRV (LF) to HF ratio (LF/HF) increased when a fast-tempo music sequence was presented. The ratio of the change in the oxytocin level was correlated with the change in HF, LF/HF and HR, whereas that in the cortisol level did not show any correlation with indices of autonomic nerve activity. There was no correlation between the change in oxytocin level and self-reported emotions, while the change in cortisol level correlated with the arousal level. These findings suggest that listening to slow-tempo and fast-tempo music is accompanied by an increase in the oxytocin level and a decrease in the cortisol level, respectively, and imply that such music listening-related changes in oxytocin and cortisol are involved in physiological relaxation and emotional excitation, respectively."

The two members of the small new kinase family 3 (NKF3) group are considered pseudokinases. These proteins, pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 (PEAK1, Sugen kinase 269, or SgK269) and pragmin (Sugen kinase 223 or SgK223), act as scaffolds in growth factor signaling pathways, and both contain a kinase fold with degraded kinase motifs at their C termini. These kinases may harbor regions that mediate oligomerization or control other aspects of signal transduction, but a lack of structural information has precluded detailed investigations into their functional roles. In this study, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the PEAK1 pseudokinase domain to 2.3 Å resolution. The structure revealed that the PEAK1 kinase-like domain contains a closed nucleotide-binding cleft that in this conformation may deleteriously affect nucleotide binding. Moreover, we found that N- and C-terminal extensions create a highly unusual all α-helical split-dimerization region, termed here the split helical dimerization (SHED) region. Sequence conservation analysis suggested that this region facilitates a dimerization mode that is conserved between PEAK1 and pragmin. Finally, we observed structural similarities between the PEAK1 SHED region and the C-terminal extension of the Parkinson’s disease-associated kinase PINK1. In summary, PEAK1’s kinase cleft is occluded, and its newly identified SHED region may promote an unexpected dimerization mode. Similarities of PEAK1 with the active kinase PINK1 may reclassify the latter as a member of the new kinase family 3 group.

https://openalex.org/W2774400405,"Background Arsenic has antimicrobial properties at high doses yet few studies have examined its effect on gut microbiota. This warrants investigation since arsenic exposure increases the risk of many diseases in which gut microbiota have been shown to play a role. We examined the association between arsenic exposure from drinking water and the composition of intestinal microbiota in children exposed to low and high arsenic levels during prenatal development and early life. Results 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that children with high arsenic exposure had a higher abundance of Proteobacteria in their stool compared to matched controls with low arsenic exposure. Furthermore, whole metagenome shotgun sequencing identified 332 bacterial SEED functions that were enriched in the high exposure group. A separate model showed that these genes, which included genes involved in virulence and multidrug resistance, were positively correlated with arsenic concentration within the group of children in the high arsenic group. We performed reference free genome assembly, and identified strains of E.coli as contributors to the arsenic enriched SEED functions. Further genome annotation of the E.coli genome revealed two strains containing two different arsenic resistance operons that are not present in the gut microbiome of a recently described European human cohort (Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract, MetaHIT). We then performed quantification by qPCR of two arsenic resistant genes (ArsB, ArsC). We observed that the expression of these two operons was higher among the children with high arsenic exposure compared to matched controls. Conclusions This preliminary study indicates that arsenic exposure early in life was associated with altered gut microbiota in Bangladeshi children. The enrichment of E.coli arsenic resistance genes in the high exposure group provides an insight into the possible mechanisms of how this toxic compound could affect gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2774349794,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by an extremely dense fibrotic stroma, which contributes to tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. During tumorigenesis, quiescent pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are activated and become major contributors to fibrosis, by increasing growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix deposition. The p53 tumor suppressor is known to restrict tumor initiation and progression through cell autonomous mechanisms including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence. There is growing evidence that stromal p53 also exerts anti-tumor activity by paracrine mechanisms, though a role for stromal p53 in PDAC has not yet been described. Here, we demonstrate that activation of stromal p53 exerts anti-tumor effects in PDAC. We show that primary cancer-associated PSCs (caPSCs) isolated from human PDAC express wild-type p53, which can be activated by the Mdm2 antagonist Nutlin-3a. Our work reveals that p53 acts as a major regulator of PSC activation and as a modulator of PDAC fibrosis. In vitro, p53 activation by Nutlin-3a induces profound transcriptional changes, which reprogram activated PSCs to quiescence. Using immunofluorescence and lipidomics, we have also found that p53 activation induces lipid droplet accumulation in both normal and tumor-associated fibroblasts, revealing a previously undescribed role for p53 in lipid storage. In vivo, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with the clinical form of Nutlin-3a induces stromal p53 activation, reverses caPSCs activation, and decreases fibrosis. All together our work uncovers new functions for stromal p53 in PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2772295156,"Histone demethylases are known to play important roles in the determination of the fate of stem cells and in cancer progression. In this study, we show that the lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4), lysine-specific demethylase 5A (KDM5A) is essential for the repression of astrocyte differentiation in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and its expression is regulated by translational machinery. Knockdown of KDM5A in NPCs increased astrocytogenesis, and conversely, KDM5A overexpression reduced the transcriptional activity of the Gfap promoter. Induction of astrocytogenesis by ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) or small interfering RNA-induced knockdown of KDM5A decreased KDM5A recruitment to the Gfap promoter and increased H3K4 methylation. The transcript level of Kdm5a was high, whereas KDM5A protein level was low in CNTF induced astrocytes. During astroglial differentiation, translational activity indicated by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)4E was decreased. Treatment of NPCs with the cercosporamide, a MAPK-interacting kinases inhibitor, reduced eIF4E phosphorylation and KDM5A protein expression, increased GFAP levels, and enhanced astrocytogenesis. These data suggest that KDM5A is a key regulator that maintains NPCs in an undifferentiated state by repressing astrocytogenesis and that its expression is translationally controlled during astrocyte differentiation. Thus, KDM5A is a promising target for the modulation of NPC fate.-Kong, S.-Y., Kim, W., Lee, H.-R., Kim, H.-J. The histone demethylase KDM5A is required for the repression of astrocytogenesis and regulated by the translational machinery in neural progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2773607603,"Wound healing is a complex and dynamic process with different distinct and overlapping phases from homeostasis, inflammation and proliferation to remodelling. Monitoring the healing response of injured tissue is of high importance for basic research and clinical practice. In traditional application, biological markers characterize normal and abnormal wound healing. Understanding functional relationships of these biological processes is essential for developing new treatment strategies. However, most of the present techniques (in vitro or in vivo) include invasive microscopic or analytical tissue sampling. In the present study, a non-invasive alternative for monitoring processes during wound healing is introduced. Within this context, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging and innovative non-invasive imaging technique with different opportunities in medical applications. HSI acquires the spectral reflectance of an object, depending on its biochemical and structural characteristics. An in-vitro 3-dimensional (3-D) wound model was established and incubated without and with acute and chronic wound fluid (AWF, CWF), respectively. Hyperspectral images of each individual specimen of this 3-D wound model were assessed at day 0/5/10 in vitro, and reflectance spectra were evaluated. For analysing the complex hyperspectral data, an efficient unsupervised approach for clustering massive hyperspectral data was designed, based on efficient hierarchical decomposition of spectral information according to archetypal data points. It represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an advanced Data Mining approach in context of non-invasive analysis of wounds using hyperspectral imagery. By this, temporal and spatial pattern of hyperspectral clusters were determined within the tissue discs and among the different treatments. Results from non-invasive imaging were compared to the number of cells in the various clusters, assessed by Hematoxylin/Eosin (H/E) staining. It was possible to correlate cell quantity and spectral reflectance during wound closure in a 3-D wound model in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2774116167,"Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a significant role in neurodegenerative disease including ataxias and other movement disorders, particularly those marked by progressive degeneration in the cerebellum. In this study, we investigate the role of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficits in cerebellar tissue of a Purkinje cell-driven spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) mouse. Using RNA sequencing transcriptomics, OXPHOS complex assembly analysis and oxygen consumption assays, we report that in the presence of mutant polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1, SCA1 mice display deficits in cerebellar OXPHOS complex I (NADH-coenzyme Q oxidoreductase). Complex I genes are upregulated at the time of symptom onset and upregulation persists into late stage disease; yet, functional assembly of complex I macromolecules are diminished and oxygen respiration through complex I is reduced. Acute treatment of postsymptomatic SCA1 mice with succinic acid, a complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) electron donor to bypass complex I dysfunction, ameliorated cerebellar OXPHOS dysfunction, reduced cerebellar pathology and improved motor behavior. Thus, exploration of mitochondrial dysfunction and its role in neurodegenerative ataxias, and warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2771476312,"High concentrations of urinary calcium counteract vasopressin action via the activation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) that is expressed in the luminal membrane of collecting duct cells, which impairs the trafficking of aquaporin-2 (AQP2). Pendrin/NaCl cotransporter double-knockout (dKO) mice display significant calcium wasting and develop severe volume depletion, despite increased circulating vasopressin levels. We hypothesized that the CaSR-mediated impairment of AQP2 expression/trafficking underlies vasopressin resistance in dKO mice. Compared with wild-type mice, in renal inner medulla, dKO mice had reduced total AQP2 sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, higher levels of AQP2-pS261, ubiquitinated AQP2, and p38-MAPK, an enzyme that is activated by CaSR signaling and known to phosphorylate AQP2 at Ser261. CaSR inhibition with the calcilytic NPS2143 reversed these effects, which indicates that CaSR mediates the up-regulation of AQP2-pS261, ubiquitination, and degradation. Of note, dKO mice demonstrated significantly higher AQP2-targeting miRNA-137 that was reduced upon CaSR inhibition, supporting a critical role for CaSR in the down-regulation of AQP2 expression. Our data indicate that CaSR signaling reduces AQP2 abundance both via AQP2-targeting miRNA-137 and the p38-MAPK/AQP2-pS261/ubiquitination/proteasomal axis. These effects may contribute to the reduced renal concentrating ability that has been observed in dKO mice and underscore a physiologic mechanism of the CaSR-dependent regulation of AQP2 abundance via a novel microRNA pathway.-Ranieri, M., Zahedi, K., Tamma, G., Centrone, M., Di Mise, A., Soleimani, M., Valenti, G. CaSR signaling down-regulates AQP2 expression via a novel microRNA pathway in pendrin and NaCl cotransporter knockout mice."

The enzyme catalyzes both 17α-hydroxylation and a subsequent 17α,20-lyase reaction, and several mechanisms have been proposed for the latter step. Zebrafish P450 17A2 catalyzes only the 17α-hydroxylations. We previously reported high similarity of the crystal structures of zebrafish P450 17A1 and 17A2 and human P450 17A1. Five residues near the heme, which differed, were changed. We also crystallized this five-residue zebrafish P450 17A1 mutant, and the active site still resembled the structure in the other proteins, with some important differences. These P450 17A1 and 17A2 mutants had catalytic profiles more similar to each other than did the wildtype proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2773154260,"Scope This study aimed to analyse the prevalence, antibiotic resistance and genetic relatedness of P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from potable and recreational water samples (n. 8,351) collected from different settings (swimming pools, n. 207; healthcare facilities, n 1,684; accommodation facilities, n. 1,518; municipal waterworks, n. 4,500; residential buildings, n. 235). Possible mechanisms underlying resistance to imipenem, with particular focus on those involving oprD-based uptake, were also explored. Methods and results Isolation and identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was performed according to the standardized procedure UNI EN ISO 16266:2008 followed by PCR confirmation. Antibiotic Susceptibility testing was conducted according to EUCAST standardized disk diffusion method. Genetic relatedness of strains was carried out by RAPD. The sequence of the oprD gene was analyzed by standard method. Fifty-three samples (0.63%) were positive for P. aeruginosa, of which 10/207 (4.83%) were from swimming pools. Five isolates (9.43%) were resistant to imipenem, one to Ticarcillin + Clavulanate, one to both Piperacillin and Ticarcillin + Clavulanate. The highest isolation rate of imipenem resistant P. aeruginosa was observed in swimming pool water. Identical RAPD profiles were found in isolates from the same location in the same year or even in different years. Conclusions Imipenem resistant strains were identified as carbapenemase-negative and resistance has been associated with inactivating mutations within the oprD gene, with a concomitant loss of porin. RAPD results proved that a water system can remain colonized by one strain for long periods and the contamination may be difficult to eradicate. This study has revealed the presence of P. aeruginosa in different water samples, including resistant strains, especially in swimming pools, and confirmed the role of porins as a contributing factor in carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2773826590,"Background The prognosis of early breast cancer (EBC) depends on patient and tumor characteristics. The association between tumor size, the largest diameter in TNM staging, and prognosis is well recognized. According to TNM, tumors classified as T2, could have very different volumes; e.g. a tumor of 2.1 cm has a volume of 4500 mm3, while a tumor of 4.9 cm has a volume of 60.000 mm3 even belonging to the same class. The aim of the study is to establish if the prognostic role of tumor size, expressed as diameter and volume, has been overshadowed by other factors. Methods The primary objective is to evaluate the association between tumor dimensions and overall survival (OS) / disease free survival (DFS), in our institution from January 1st 2005 to September 30th 2013 in a surgical T1-T2 population. Volume was evaluated with the measurement of three half-diameters of the tumor (a, b and c), and calculated using the following formula: 4/3π x a x b x c. Results 341 patients with T1-T2 EBC were included. 86.5% were treated with conservative surgery. 85.1% had a Luminal subtype, 9.1% were Triple negative and 7.4% were HER2 positive. Median volume was 942 mm3 (range 0.52–31.651.2). 44 patients (12.9%) relapsed and 23 patients died. With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the univariate analysis for DFS showed an association between age, tumor size, volume, histological grading and molecular subtype. The multivariate analysis confirmed the statistically significant association only for molecular subtype (p 0.005), with a worse prognosis for Triple negative and HER2 positive subtypes compared with Luminal (HR: 2.65; 95%CI: 1.34–5.22). Likewise for OS, an association was shown by the multivariate analysis solely for molecular subtype (HER2 and Triple negative vs. Luminal. HR: 2.83; 95% CI:1.46–5.49; p 0.002). Conclusions In our study, the only parameter that strongly influences survival is molecular subtype. These findings encourage clinicians to choose adjuvant treatment not based on dimensional criteria but on biological features."
https://openalex.org/W2772773168,"We aimed to evaluate the association between family socioeconomic status and repeatedly measured child television viewing time from early childhood to the school period. We analyzed data on 3,561 Dutch children from the Generation R Study, a population-based study in the Netherlands. Parent-reported television viewing time for children aged 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9 years were collected by questionnaires sent from April 2004 until January 2015. Odds ratios of watching television ≥1 hour/day at each age were calculated for children of mothers with low, mid-low, mid-high and high (reference group) education and children from low, middle and high (reference group) income households. A generalized logistic mixed model was used to assess the association between family socioeconomic status and child television viewing time trajectory. The percentage of children watching television ≥1 hour/day increased from age 2 to 9 years for all children (24.2%-85.0% for children of low-educated mothers; 4.7%-61.4% for children of high-educated mothers; 17.2%-74.9% for children from low income households; 6.2%-65.1% for children from high income households). Independent socioeconomic effect in child television viewing time was found for maternal educational level. The interaction between net household income and child age in longitudinal analyses was significant (p = 0.01), indicating that the television viewing time trajectories were different in household income subgroups. However the interaction between maternal educational level and child age was not significant (p = 0.19). Inverse socioeconomic gradients in child television viewing time were found from the preschool period to the late school period. The educational differences between the various educational subgroups remained stable with increasing age, but the differences between household income groups changed over time. Intervention developers and healthcare practitioners need to raise awareness among non-highly educated parents that the socioeconomic gradient in television viewing time has a tracking effect starting from preschool age."
https://openalex.org/W2772647422,"Identifying environmental characteristics that define the ecological niche of a species is essential to understanding how changes in physical conditions might affect its distribution and other aspects of its ecology. The present study used satellite relay data loggers (SRDLs) to study habitat use by Northeast Atlantic hooded seals (N = 20; 9 adult females, 3 adult males, and 8 juveniles). Three different methods were used in combination to achieve maximum insight regarding key foraging areas for hooded seals in this region, which have decline by 85% in recent decades: 1) first passage time (FPT); 2) vertical transit rate and; 3) change in dive drift rate. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) were applied to each method to determine whether specific habitat characteristics were associated with foraging. Separate models were run for the post-molting and the post-breeding seasons; sex and age classes were included in the GAMMs. All three methods highlighted a few common geographic areas as being important foraging zones; however, there were also some different areas identified by the different methods, which highlights the importance of using multiple indexes when analyzing tracking and diving data to study foraging behavior. Foraging occurred most commonly in relatively shallow areas with high Sea Surface Temperatures (SST), corresponding to continental shelf areas with Atlantic Water masses. All age and sex classes overlapped spatially to some extent, but the different age and sex groups showed differences in the bathymetry of their foraging areas as well as in their vertical use of the water column. When foraging, pups dove in the upper part of the water column in relatively deep areas. Adult females foraged relatively shallowly in deep water areas too, though in shallower areas than pups. Adult males foraged close to the bottom in shallower areas."
https://openalex.org/W2773715350,"The mammalian hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to chronic stress. Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is suppressed by chronic stress and by administration of glucocorticoid hormones. Post-natal and adult neurogenesis are present in the avian hippocampal formation as well, but much less is known about its sensitivity to chronic stressors. In this study, we investigate this question in a commercial bird model: the broiler breeder chicken. Commercial broiler breeders are food restricted during development to manipulate their growth curve and to avoid negative health outcomes, including obesity and poor reproductive performance. Beyond knowing that these chickens are healthier than fully-fed birds and that they have a high motivation to eat, little is known about how food restriction impacts the animals' physiology. Chickens were kept on a commercial food-restricted diet during the first 12 weeks of life, or released from this restriction by feeding them ad libitum from weeks 7–12 of life. To test the hypothesis that chronic food restriction decreases the production of new neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal formation, the cell proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine was injected one week prior to tissue collection. Corticosterone levels in blood plasma were elevated during food restriction, even though molecular markers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation did not differ between the treatments. The density of new hippocampal neurons was significantly reduced in the food-restricted condition, as compared to chickens fed ad libitum, similar to findings in rats at a similar developmental stage. Food restriction did not affect hippocampal volume or the total number of neurons. These findings indicate that in birds, like in mammals, reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with chronically elevated corticosterone levels, and therefore potentially with chronic stress in general. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the response to stressors in the avian hippocampal formation is homologous to that of the mammalian hippocampus."

The fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) and partial pressure of inspired O2 (PiO2) were 0.209 and 133.1 ± 0.3 mmHg for NBR and 0.141 ± 0.004 and 90.0 ± 0.4 mmHg for both hypoxic variants (HBR and HAmb; ~4000 m simulated altitude), respectively. A number of parameters linked to intestinal environment such as defecation frequency, intestinal electrical conductivity (IEC), sterol and polyphenol content and diversity, indole, aromaticity and spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were measured (64 variables). The structure and diversity of bacterial microbial community was assessed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Inactivity negatively affected frequency of defecation and in combination with hypoxia increased IEC (p < 0.05). In contrast, sterol and polyphenol diversity and content, various characteristics of DOM and aromatic compounds, the structure and diversity of bacterial microbial community were not significantly affected over time. A new in-house PlanHab database was established to integrate all measured variables on host physiology, diet, experiment, immune and metabolic markers (n = 231). The observed progressive decrease in defecation frequency and concomitant increase in IEC suggested that the transition from healthy physiological state towards the developed symptoms of low magnitude obesity-related syndromes was dose dependent on the extent of time spent in inactivity and preceded or took place in absence of significant rearrangements in bacterial microbial community.

We examined the effects of plant responses to herbivory in a hummingbird-pollinated distylous shrub, Palicourea angustifolia. Through a series of field experiments we investigated whether damage from foliar herbivores leads to a reduction in fruit set, influences floral visitation, or alters floral traits that may influence pollinator preference or pollinator efficiency. Foliar herbivory by a generalist grasshopper led to reduced fruit set in branches that were directly damaged as well as in adjacent undamaged branches on the same plant. Furthermore, herbivory resulted in reduced floral visitation from two common hummingbird species and two bee species. An investigation into the potential mechanisms behind reduced floral visitation in induced plants showed that foliar herbivore damage resulted in shorter styles and lower nectar volumes. This reduction in style length could reduce pollen deposition between different floral morphs that is required for optimal pollination in a distylous plant. We did not detect any differences in the volatile blends released by damaged and undamaged branches, suggesting that foliar herbivore-induced changes in floral morphology and rewards, and not volatile blends, are the primary mechanism mediating changes in visitation. Our results provide novel mechanisms for how plant responses induced by foliar herbivores can lead to ecological costs."
https://openalex.org/W2773564219,"Transmembrane protein 168 (TMEM168) comprises 697 amino acid residues, including some putative transmembrane domains. It is reported that TMEM168 controls methamphetamine (METH) dependence in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice. Moreover, a strong link between METH dependence-induced adaptive changes in the brain and mood disorders has been evaluated. In the present study, we investigated the effects of accumbal TMEM168 in a battery of behavioral paradigms. The adeno-associated virus (AAV) Tmem168 vector was injected into the NAc of C57BL/6J mice (NAc-TMEM mice). Subsequently, the accumbal TMEM168 mRNA was increased approximately by seven-fold when compared with the NAc-Mock mice (controls). The NAc-TMEM mice reported no change in the locomotor activity, cognitive ability, social interaction, and depression-like behaviors; however, TMEM168 overexpression enhanced anxiety in the elevated-plus maze and light/dark box test. The increased anxiety was reversed by pretreatment with the antianxiety drug diazepam (0.3 mg/kg i.p.). Moreover, the NAc-TMEM mice exhibited decreased prepulse inhibition (PPI) in the startle response test, and the induced schizophrenia-like behavior was reversed by pretreatment with the antipsychotic drug risperidone (0.01 mg/kg i.p.). Furthermore, accumbal TMEM168 overexpression decreased the basal levels of extracellular GABA in the NAc and the high K+ (100 mM)-stimulated GABA elevation; however, the total contents of GABA in the NAc remained unaffected. These results suggest that the TMEM168-regulated GABAergic neuronal system in the NAc might become a novel target while studying the etiology of anxiety and sensorimotor gating deficits."

The standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR) is widely used for quantification but is subject to variability. Here we evaluate how SUVR of a cortical target region is affected by blood flow changes in the target and two frequently used reference regions.Regional baseline time-activity curves (TACs) were simulated based on metabolite-corrected plasma input functions and pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from our previously acquired data in healthy control (HC; n = 10), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; n = 15) and AD cohorts (n = 9). Blood flow changes were simulated by altering the regional tracer delivery rate K1 (and clearance rate k2) between -40% and +40% from its regional baseline value in the target region and/or cerebellar grey (CB) or subcortical white matter (WM) reference regions. The corresponding change in SUVR was calculated at 50-60 min post-injection.A -40% blood flow reduction in the target resulted in an increased SUVRtarget (e.g. SUVRprecuneus: +10.0±5% in HC, +2.5±2% in AD), irrespective of the used reference region. A -40% blood flow reduction in the WM reference region increased SUVRWM (+11.5±4% in HC, +13.5±3% in AD) while a blood flow reduction in CB decreased SUVRCB (-9.5±6% in HC, -5.5±2% in AD), irrespective of the used target region. A -40% flow reduction in both the precuneus and reference WM (i.e., global flow change) induced an increased SUVR (+22.5±8% in HC, +16.0±4% in AD). When considering reference CB instead, SUVR was decreased by less than -5% (both in HC and AD).Blood flow changes introduce alterations in [18F]AV45 PET SUVR. Flow reductions in the CB and WM reference regions resulted in a decreased and increased SUVR of the target, respectively. SUVR was more affected by global blood flow changes when considering WM instead of CB normalization."
https://openalex.org/W2775436729,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammation of the large bowel characterized by diarrhea and a negative stool culture. However, several enteropathogens have been implicated as causative agents in UC. The differentiation between chronic infectious colitis (IC) and UC with concurrent infection is difficult owing to their similar clinical presentations. The study aimed to explore the presentations and diagnostic clues that enable differentiation between UC with concomitant infections and chronic IC. The study included 17 UC patients with a bacterial infection and 46 with chronic IC. The UC patients (47 ± 19 years) were younger than the chronic IC patients (58 ± 20 years) (P = 0.022). Bloody diarrhea was more common in UC than in chronic IC (58.8% vs 10.9%, P < 0.001). Previous antibiotic usage was a risk factor for chronic IC (5.9% vs 32.6%, P = 0.031). Malignancy was a common comorbidity of chronic IC (5.9% vs 34.8%, P = 0.022). UC patients had lower antibiotic response rates than chronic IC patients (60.0% vs 87.2%, P = 0.026). Aeromonas species and Clostridium difficile were common in both groups. Histological features of cryptitis and crypt abscess were useful in the diagnosis of UC (P = 0.052 and P = 0.016, respectively). Bloody diarrhea in a young adult, decreased response to antibiotic treatment, and results of endoscopy with biopsy are important features in the diagnosis of UC with bacterial infection."

On the other hand, the calculation of continuous MS scores using standardized residuals in linear regression (Z scores) or factor scores of principal component analysis (PCA) is highly impractical for clinical use. Recently, a novel, easily calculated continuous MS score called siMS score was developed based on the IDF MS criteria for the adult population.To develop a Pediatric siMS score (PsiMS), a modified continuous MS score for use in the obese youth, based on the original siMS score, while keeping the score as simple as possible and retaining high correlation with more complex scores.The database consisted of clinical data on 153 obese (BMI ≥95th percentile) children and adolescents. Continuous MS scores were calculated using Z scores and PCA, as well as the original siMS score. Four variants of PsiMS score were developed in accordance with IDF criteria for MS in youth and correlation of these scores with PCA and Z score derived MS continuous scores was assessed.PsiMS score calculated using formula: (2xWaist/Height) + (Glucose(mmol/l)/5.6) + (triglycerides(mmol/l)/1.7) + (Systolic BP/130)-(HDL(mmol/l)/1.02) showed the highest correlation with most of the complex continuous scores (0.792-0.901). The original siMS score also showed high correlation with continuous MS scores.PsiMS score represents a practical and accurate score for the evaluation of MS in the obese youth. The original siMS score should be used when evaluating large cohorts consisting of both adults and children."

Nosocomial transmission is reduced with implementation of infection control (IC) guidelines. The objective of this study is to describe implementation of TB IC measures in Malawi. We conducted a cross-sectional study utilizing anonymous health worker questionnaires, semi-structured interviews with facility managers, and direct observations at 17 facilities in central Malawi. Of 592 health care workers surveyed, 34% reported that all patients entering the facility were screened for cough and only 8% correctly named the four most common signs and symptoms of TB in adults. Of 33 managers interviewed, 7 (21%) and 1 (3%) provided the correct TB screening questions for use in adults and children, respectively. Of 592 health workers, only 2.4% had been screened for TB in the previous year. Most (90%) reported knowing their HIV status, 53% were tested at their facility of employment, and half reported they would feel comfortable receiving ART or TB treatment at their facility of employment. We conclude that screening is infrequently conducted and knowledge gaps may undercut its effectiveness. Further, health care workers do not routinely access TB and HIV diagnostic and treatment services at their facility of employment."
https://openalex.org/W2772403300,"The DNA microstates that regulate transcription include sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs), coregulatory complexes, nucleosomes, histone modifications, DNA methylation, and parts of the three-dimensional architecture of genomes, which could create an enormous combinatorial complexity across the genome. However, many proteins and epigenetic marks are known to colocalize, suggesting that the information content encoded in these marks can be compressed. It has so far proved difficult to understand this compression in a systematic and quantitative manner. Here, we show that simple linear models can reliably predict the data generated by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics consortia. Further, we demonstrate that a small number of marks can predict all other marks with high average correlation across the genome, systematically revealing the substantial information compression that is present in different cell lines. We find that the linear models for activating marks are typically cell line-independent, while those for silencing marks are predominantly cell line-specific. Of particular note, a nuclear receptor corepressor, transducin beta-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBLR1), was highly predictive of other marks in two hematopoietic cell lines. The methodology presented here shows how the potentially vast complexity of TFs, coregulators, and epigenetic marks at eukaryotic genes is highly redundant and that the information present can be compressed onto a much smaller subset of marks. These findings could be used to efficiently characterize cell lines and tissues based on a small number of diagnostic marks and suggest how the DNA microstates, which regulate the expression of individual genes, can be specified."
https://openalex.org/W2771191916,"Fall dormancy (FD) determines the adaptation of an alfalfa variety and affects alfalfa production and quality. However, the molecular mechanism underlying FD remains poorly understood. Here, 44 genes regulating FD were identified by comparison of the transcriptomes from leaves of Maverick (fall-dormant alfalfa) and CUF101(non-fall-dormant), during FD and non-FD and were classified them depending on their function. The transcription of IAA-amino acid hydrolase ILR1-like 1, abscisic acid receptor PYL8, and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase-3 in Maverick leaves was regulated by daylength and temperature, and the transcription of the abscisic acid receptor PYL8 was mainly affected by daylength. The changes in the expression of these genes and the abundance of their messenger RNA (mRNA) in Maverick leaves differed from those in CUF101 leaves, as evidenced by the correlation analysis of their mRNA abundance profiles obtained from April to October. The present findings suggested that these genes are involved in regulating FD in alfalfa."
https://openalex.org/W2772453406,"In children with symptoms suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who present in primary care, the optimal test strategy for identifying those who require specialist care is unclear. We evaluated the following three test strategies to determine which was optimal for referring children with suspected IBD to specialist care: 1) alarm symptoms alone, 2) alarm symptoms plus c-reactive protein, and 3) alarm symptoms plus fecal calprotectin.A prospective cohort study was conducted, including children with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms referred to pediatric gastroenterology. Outcome was defined as IBD confirmed by endoscopy, or IBD ruled out by either endoscopy or unremarkable clinical 12 month follow-up with no indication for endoscopy. Test strategy probabilities were generated by logistic regression analyses and compared by area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and decision curves.We included 90 children, of whom 17 (19%) had IBD (n = 65 from primary care physicians, n = 25 from general pediatricians). Adding fecal calprotectin to alarm symptoms increased the AUC significantly from 0.80 (0.67-0.92) to 0.97 (0.93-1.00), but adding c-reactive protein to alarm symptoms did not increase the AUC significantly (p > 0.05). Decision curves confirmed these patterns, showing that alarm symptoms combined with fecal calprotectin produced the diagnostic test strategy with the highest net benefit at reasonable threshold probabilities.In primary care, when children are identified as being at high risk for IBD, adding fecal calprotectin testing to alarm symptoms was the optimal strategy for improving risk stratification."
https://openalex.org/W2772877735,"Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in hair development and cytoskeleton formation in mammals. Its proliferation is implicated in several forms of cancer including liver cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and metastatic prostate cancer. Current study emphasizes the isolation of competitive non-lipid and stable peptide antagonists for Lysophosphatidic acid ligand. A total of 148 conotoxin structures were characterized for their binding abilities against LPAR6. Subsequently, top 10 conotoxins were selected on the basis of binding energy values, residual contributions and conformational cluster saturations. BuIA (a member of Alpha- conotoxins family), contryphan-R and contryphan-Lo (Synthetic class) conotoxins, exhibiting efficient binding parameters were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation assays and topology analysis. We propose that BuIA might be a potent antagonist due to its predominant binding at the extracellular region of LPAR6. Current study provides a backbone for understanding structural and functional insights of LPAR6 and findings of this study may be helpful in designing novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancers caused by elevated LPAR6 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2773229832,"Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol, has been reported to produce effect on genes transcription in lipid metabolism. In this study, we aim to explore the novel mechanisms of RSV on the regulation of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) transcription. Via body weight, blood glucose, serum lipid, and liver pathology detection, we found that RSV decreased body weight, blood glucose and lipid accumulation in rats fed high-fat diet. Based on co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and western blotting assay, we found that RSV up-regulated klf5 phosphorylation and decreased the interaction of klf5 with c-Myc, which were accompanied by down-regulation of Cav-1 expression in livers of rats fed with high-fat diet. Moreover, in HEK293 cells, we observed RSV enhanced klf5 phosphorylation and separated the interaction of klf5 with c-Myc through inhibiting the activation of PI3K/PKD1/Akt pathway, which maybe promoted c-Myc binding to the promoter to inhibit Cav-1 expression. The results of the present study demonstrated that RSV activated klf5 phosphorylation by inhibiting PI3K/PKD1/Akt pathway, and then attenuated the interaction of klf5 with c-Myc, subsequently probably promoted the c-Myc binding to the promoter to repress Cav-1 expression."

In chronic pruritus, topical treatment with Naltrexone changes μ-opioid receptor (μ-OR) localization to relieve itch. The molecular mechanisms behind the effects of Naltrexone on μ-OR function in reduction of itching behavior has not been studied. There is an immediate need to understand the endogenous complexity of μ-OR dynamics in normal and pathological skin conditions. Here we evaluate real-time behavior of μ-OR-Endomorphine complexes in the presence of agonist and antagonists. The μ-OR ligand Endomorphine-1 (EM) was conjugated to the fluorescent dye Tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) to investigate the effects of agonist and antagonists in N/TERT-1 keratinocytes. The cellular localization of the EM-TAMRA was followed through time resolved confocal microscopy and population analysis was performed by flow cytometry. The in vitro analyses demonstrate fast internalization and trafficking of the endogenous EM-TAMRA-μ-OR interactions in a qualitative manner. Competition with Endomorphine-1, Naltrexone and CTOP show both canonical and non-canonical effects in basal and differentiated keratinocytes. Acute and chronic treatment with Naltrexone and Endomorphine-1 increases EM-TAMRA binding to skin cells. Although Naltrexone is clinically effective in relieving itch, the mechanisms behind re-distribution of μ-ORs during clinical treatments are not known. Our study has given insight into cellular mechanisms of μ-OR ligand-receptor interactions after opioid agonist and antagonist treatments in vitro. These findings potentially offer opportunities in using novel treatment strategies for skin and peripheral sensory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2774167434,"Extrafloral nectaries can occur in both vegetative and reproductive plant structures. In many Rubiaceae species in the Brazilian Cerrado, after corolla abscission, the floral nectary continues to secret nectar throughout fruit development originating post-floral pericarpial nectaries which commonly attract many ant species. The occurrence of such nectar secreting structures might be strategic for fruit protection against seed predators, as plants are expected to invest higher on more valuable and vulnerable parts. Here, we performed ant exclusion experiments to investigate whether the interaction with ants mediated by the pericarpial nectaries of Tocoyena formosa affects plant reproductive success by reducing the number of pre-dispersal seed predators. We also assessed whether ant protection was dependent on ant species composition and resource availability. Although most of the plants were visited by large and aggressive ant species, such as Ectatomma tuberculatum and species of the genus Camponotus, ants did not protect fruits against seed predators. Furthermore, the result of the interaction was neither related to ant species composition nor to the availability of resources. We suggest that these results may be related to the nature and behavior of the most important seed predators, like Hemicolpus abdominalis weevil which the exoskeleton toughness prevent it from being predated by most ant species. On the other hand, not explored factors, such as reward quality, local ant abundance, ant colony characteristics and/or the presence of alternative energetic sources could also account for variations in ant frequency, composition, and finally ant protective effects, highlighting the conditionality of facultative plant-ant mutualisms."

Surprisingly the attrition ratio in Phase III trials in oncology is significantly higher than in any other medical specialty. This suggests phase II trials in oncology fail to achieve their goal. Objective The present study aims at estimating the quality of reporting in published oncology phase II clinical trials. Data sources A literature review was conducted among all phase II and phase II/III clinical trials published during a 5-year period (2010–2015). Study eligibility criteria All articles electronically published by three randomly-selected oncology journals with Impact-Factors>4 were included: Journal of Clinical Oncology, Annals of Oncology and British Journal of Cancer. Intervention Quality of reporting was assessed using the Key Methodological Score. Results 557 articles were included. 315 trials were single-arm studies (56.6%), 193 (34.6%) were randomized and 49 (8.8%) were non-randomized multiple-arm studies. The Methodological Score was equal to 0 (lowest level), 1, 2, 3 (highest level) respectively for 22 (3.9%), 119 (21.4%), 270 (48.5%) and 146 (26.2%) articles. The primary end point is almost systematically reported (90.5%), while sample size calculation is missing in 66% of the articles. 3 variables were independently associated with reporting of a high standard: presence of statistical design (p-value <0.001), multicenter trial (p-value = 0.012), per-protocol analysis (p-value <0.001). Limitations Screening was mainly performed by a sole author. The Key Methodological Score was based on only 3 items, making grey zones difficult to translate. Conclusions & implications of key findings This literature review highlights the existence of gaps concerning the quality of reporting. It therefore raised the question of the suitability of the methodology as well as the quality of these trials, reporting being incomplete in the corresponding articles."

During this period, the massive transcriptional activation, called zygotic genome activation (ZGA), is mediated by maternally stored factors, and maternal mRNA clearance by conserved zygotic microRNAs (miRNAs) occurs; however, the important transition in avian species was identified by morphologic perspectives only. In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis to examine the molecular transitions of intrauterine development in chickens. On the basis of coexpression analyses on RNA sequencing data, 2 waves of ZGA-mediated MZT were observed across the early embryonic stages and were associated with transcriptional and translational dynamics. Furthermore, definite transitions were observed according to the distinct developmental characteristics between cleavage and the area pellucida formation period in the functional analysis. Finally, epigenetic modification and the evolutionarily conserved miRNA expression suggest that certain MZT proceeds from Eyal-Giladi and Kochav stage VIII in early chicken development. We expect our study to provide an evolutionary link among vertebrates from the perspective of MZT regulation.-Hwang, Y. S., Seo, M., Bang, S., Kim, H., Han, J. Y.

An early and reliable diagnosis of histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) in preterm infants may be helpful in guiding postnatal management, especially the administration of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent early-onset sepsis. The main aim of this study was to investigate metabolomic analysis of urines collected in the first 24 hours of life as diagnostic tool of HCA.Gestational age-, birth weight-, delivery mode- and sex- matched (1:2) preterm neonates (< 35 weeks' gestation) born to mothers with or without HCA were enrolled from an observational study. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomic analysis was performed on urine samples non-invasively collected in the first 24 hours of life. Univariate analysis, partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and its associated variable importance in projection (VIP) score were performed. The most affected metabolic pathways were examined by Metabolite Sets Enrichment Analysis (MSEA).Fifteen cases (mean GA 30.2 ± 3.8 weeks, mean BW 1415 ± 471.9 grams) and 30 controls (mean GA 30.2 ± 2.9 weeks, mean BW 1426 ± 569.8 grams) were enrolled. Following univariate analysis, 29 metabolites had a significantly different concentration between cases and controls. The supervised PLS-DA model confirmed a separation between the two groups. Only gluconic acid, an oxidation product of glucose, was higher in cases than in controls. All other VIP metabolites were more abundant in the control group. Glutamate metabolism, mitochondrial electron transport chain, citric acid cycle, galactose metabolism, and fructose and mannose degradation metabolism were the most significantly altered pathways (P < 0.01).For the first time, urinary metabolomics was able to discriminate neonates born to mothers with and without HCA.

When combined with a data-independent network prior, the framework outperformed all other methods submitted to the HPN-DREAM 8 breast cancer network inference challenge. Our investigations reveal that PGC provides complementary information to other approaches, raising the performance of ensemble learners, while on its own achieves moderate performance. Thus, PGC serves as a valuable new tool in the bioinformatics toolkit for analyzing temporal datasets. We investigate the general and cell-specific interactions predicted by our method and find several novel interactions, demonstrating the utility of the approach in charting new tumor wiring."

Despite the great interest in this topic and the research effort in exploring it, to date, there are no reliable data. Therefore, we carried out a scientometric analysis of the scientific literature published in peer reviewed Journals concerning this topic to better understand the reasons of this partial failure. To this aim, we identified and analysed 104 papers, published in last 26 years in peer-reviewed Journals, present in ISI Web of Knowledge Core Collection. Then, we analysed the impact of the Journals in which the papers were published as well as that of the single papers, the paper citation dynamics, the keywords citation busts, the geographical localization of citations and the co-authorship dynamics of the Authors. As a result, we found that different animal models (rodent, rabbit, guinea pig, and swine) and different experimental approaches (epidemiological vs. experimental studies) have the same impact, highlighting the lack of universally adopted standard in research activity. The analysis of the temporal trend in keywords and the high differences in citations between the different countries (also in those belonging to the same geographical and socio-economical area) pointed out the difficulties in approaching this branch of study. Lastly, it was evident that the Authors did not behave as a connected community, but as unconnected clusters of very small size. In conclusion, based on the results of our analysis, we think that important efforts must be undertaken to adopt more standardized models and to improve the research quality and the information exchange within the scientific community, with the aim of improving the reliability and usefulness of the results of research regarding the effect of NI-EMFs on fertility."

In a UK population sample, we aimed to assess cardio-metabolic (CM) health in those taking these chronic pain medications. Methods 133,401 participants from the UK Biobank cohort were studied. BMI, waist cm and hypertension were compared between those on drugs prescribed for chronic pain and CM drugs to those on CM drugs only. Multiple confounders were controlled for. Results Those taking opiates and CM drugs had the worst CM health profile with a 95%, 82% and 63% increased odds of reporting obesity, ‘very high risk’ waist circumference and hypertension, respectively (OR [95% CI] 1.95 [1.75–2.17], 1.82 [1.63–2.03], 1.63 [1.45–1.84]), compared to those on CM drugs alone. Those taking neuropathic pain medications and CM drugs also demonstrate worse CM profile than those taking CM drugs only. Conclusions The impact of medications for chronic pain and sleep upon CM health and obesity is of concern for these classes of drugs which have been recently labelled as dependency forming medications. The results from this cross sectional study warrants further investigation and adds further support to calls for these medications to be prescribed for shorter periods."

Health outcomes and personal endotoxin exposure estimates were determined for 234 farmers and agricultural workers both at baseline and 5 years later. A questionnaire was used to assess respiratory symptoms, spirometry tests were performed and total and specific IgE levels were measured in serum. A twofold increase in personal endotoxin exposure was associated with less hay fever (OR 0.68, 95%CI 0.54-0.87) and grass IgE positivity (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.68-0.97) at both time points (“persistent” versus “never”). Although not statistically significant, a consistent protective pattern was observed for an increased loss of hay fever symptoms (OR 2.19, 95%CI 0.96-4.99) and grass IgE positivity (OR 1.24, 95%CI 0.76-2.02), and for less new-onset of hay fever (OR 0.87, 95%CI 0.65-1.17), grass IgE positivity (OR 0.83, 95%CI 0.61-1.12) and atopic sensitization (OR 0.75, 95%CI 0.55-1.02). Endotoxin exposure was not associated with changes in lung function. We showed that occupational endotoxin exposure is associated with a long-term protective effect on hay fever and grass IgE positivity. Results on longitudinal changes in hay fever, atopy and grass IgE positivity in adulthood were consistent with a protective effect of endotoxin exposure, but results need to be confirmed in larger cohorts. An effect of endotoxin exposure on lung function decline was not found."

In addition, a snapshot imaging modality is required for simultaneous imaging. The Image Mapping Spectrometer (IMS) is a snapshot hyperspectral imaging system that collects high resolution spectral data and can be used to overcome these challenges. We have previously demonstrated the IMS’s capabilities for simultaneously imaging GFP and CFP/YFP-based biosensors in pancreatic β-cells. Here, we demonstrate a further capability of the IMS to image simultaneously two FRET biosensors with a single excitation band, one for cAMP and the other for Caspase-3.

As a member of the C/EBP family, CHOP contains a low complexity N-terminal region involved in transcriptional activation, followed by a bZIP that binds DNA after dimerization. However, in contrast to other C/EBPs, CHOP directs binding to non-canonical C/EBP sites due to unique substitutions in its DNA-binding domain. Herein, we show that the N-terminal region of CHOP is intrinsically unstructured but contains two segments presenting α-helical propensity. One of these segments is conserved in other C/EBPs and mediates essential roles of CHOP, including regulation through phosphorylation. The second segment is placed within a proteolytic-resistant portion of the protein and exhibits reduced flexibility. Moreover, the DNA-binding region of CHOP also contains a segment with α-helical character towards its most N-terminal part. Our results suggest that structure-prone segments scattered within disordered regions may be critical for macromolecular recognition during CHOP-mediated transcriptional activation."

Ubiquitin networks help dictate the strength and duration of inflammatory signaling. In innate immunity, the itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH)-A20 ubiquitin–editing complex inhibits receptor-interacting Ser/Thr kinase (RIPK) activation by removing Lys-63–linked polyubiquitinated chains from key proteins in the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. The complex then attaches polyubiquitinated chains to these proteins to target them for lysosomal or proteasomal destruction. ITCH is phosphorylated and thereby inhibited by inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKKβ) to fine-tune the inflammatory response to the strength of the offending signal. However, the biochemical mechanism by which E3 ubiquitination is impaired by IKK-driven phosphorylation remains unclear. Here, we report that this phosphorylation impedes ITCH binding to its cognate E2 ubiquitin ligase, UbcH7. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genetic knockout to mimic the ITCH-UbcH7–inhibited state, we further show that genetic UbcH7 deficiency phenocopies ITCH phosphorylation in regulating RIPK2 ubiquitination. We conclude that phosphorylation can disrupt the binding of an E3 ubiquitin ligase to an E2-conjugating enzyme, leading to prolonged inflammatory signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E3 ubiquitin ligase phosphorylation inhibiting E3 ligase activity by impairing E2–E3 complex formation.

In some tertiary referral hospitals in Ghana, PIH is the leading cause of institutional maternal mortality.To evaluate blood pressure changes during pregnancy amongst different body mass index (BMI) groups and how this relates to the risk of developing PIH.Women who had a dating ultrasound before 20 weeks gestation and registering for antenatal care at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, between February and December 2013 and met the inclusion criteria were recruited into a cohort study. BMI was assessed at baseline. Blood pressure measurements were taken at (±2) 24, 28 and 36 weeks. Primary outcome measure of interest during follow-up was a diagnosis of PIH at these points. BP changes during follow up at the three points were measured. Descriptive analysis of baseline factors was carried out and compared for the BMI groups. Relative risk (RR) of PIH was estimated at 95% confidence interval.Mean (SD) age for the 361 women was 30.9 (4.8) years. Incidence of PIH amongst the cohort was 10.5% (95% CI: 7.45% - 14.45%) and 40.4% and 33.0% of them were overweight and obese respectively at baseline. Pregnant women who were obese at baseline had a three-fold increased risk of PIH compared to those with normal BMI [RR = 3.01 (1.06-8.52), p = 0.04].Obese women have a significantly increased risk of PIH. Women should be screened at booking for obesity status. Antenatal protocols should have interventions for prevention or early detection of obesity and management of obesity to improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2771806767,"To evaluate the general contextual effect (GCE) of the hospital department on one-year mortality in Swedish and Danish patients with heart failure (HF) by applying a multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity.Using the Swedish patient register, we obtained data on 36,943 patients who were 45-80 years old and admitted for HF to the hospital between 2007 and 2009. From the Danish Heart Failure Database (DHFD), we obtained data on 12,001 patients with incident HF who were 18 years or older and treated at hospitals between June 2010 and June2013. For each year, we applied two-step single and multilevel logistic regression models. We evaluated the general effects of the department by quantifying the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and the increment in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) obtained by adding the random effects of the department in a multilevel logistic regression analysis.One-year mortality for Danish incident HF patients was low in the three audit years (around 11.1% -13.1%) and departments performed homogeneously (ICC ≈1.5% - 3.5%). The discriminatory accuracy of a model including age and gender was rather high (AUC≈ 0.71-0.73) but the increment in AUC after adding the department random effects into these models was only about 0.011-0.022 units in the three years. One-year mortality in Swedish patients with first hospitalization for heart failure, was relatively higher for 2007-2009 (≈21.3% - 22%) and departments performed homogeneously (ICC ≈ 1.5% - 3%). The discriminatory accuracy of a model including age, gender and patient risk score was rather high (AUC≈ 0.726-0.728) but the increment in AUC after adding the department random effects was only about 0.010-0.017 units in the three years.Using the DHFD standard benchmark for one-year mortality, Danish departments had a good, homogeneous performance. In reference to literature, Swedish departments had a homogeneous performance and the mortality rates for patients with first hospitalization for heart failure were similar to those reported since 2000. Considering this, if health authorities decide to further reduce mortality rates, a comprehensive quality strategy should focus on all Swedish hospitals. Yet, a complementary assessment for the period after the study period is required to confirm whether department performance is still homogeneous or not to determine the most appropriate action."
https://openalex.org/W2772052751,"In this study, a non-contact type intraocular pressure (IOP) measuring system using reflected pneumatic pressure is proposed to overcome the disadvantages of existing measurement systems. A ring-type nozzle, a key component in the proposed system, is designed via computational fluid analysis. It predicts the reflected pneumatic pressure based on the nozzle exit angle and inner and outer diameters of the nozzle, which are 30°, 7 mm, and 9 mm, respectively. Performance evaluation is conducted using artificial eyes fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane with the specifications of human eyes. The IOP of the fabricated artificial eyes is adjusted to 10, 30, and 50 mm Hg, and the reflected pneumatic pressure is measured as a function of the distance between the ring-type nozzle and artificial eye. The measured reflected pneumatic pressure is high when the measurement distance is short and eye pressure is low. The cornea of an artificial eye is significantly deformed at a low IOP, and the applied pneumatic pressure is more concentrated in front of the ring-type nozzle because of the deformed cornea. Thus, the reflected pneumatic pressure at a low IOP has more inflows into the pressure sensor inserted inside the nozzle. The sensitivity of the output based on the IOP at measurement distances between 3-5 mm is -0.0027, -0.0022, -0.0018, -0.0015, and -0.0012. Sensitivity decreases as the measurement distance increases. In addition, the reflected pneumatic pressure owing to the misalignment at the measurement distances of 3-5 mm is not affected within a range of 0.5 mm. Therefore, the measurement range is acceptable up to a 1 mm diameter from the center of an artificial eye. However, the accuracy gradually decreases as the reflected pneumatic pressure from a misalignment of 1 mm or more decreases by 26% or more."
https://openalex.org/W2772122944,"In mammalian cells, de novo glycerolipid synthesis begins with the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate, catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPAT). GPAT2 is a mitochondrial isoform primarily expressed in testis under physiological conditions, and overexpressed in several types of cancers and cancer-derived human cell lines where its expression contributes to the tumor phenotype. Using gene silencing and atomic force microscopy, we studied the correlation between GPAT2 expression and cell surface topography, roughness and membrane permeability in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, we analyzed the glycerolipid composition by gas-liquid chromatography. GPAT2 expression altered the arachidonic acid content in glycerolipids, and the lack of GPAT2 seems to be partially compensated by the overexpression of another arachidonic-acid-metabolizing enzyme, AGPAT11. GPAT2 expressing cells exhibited a rougher topography and less membrane damage than GPAT2 silenced cells. Pore-like structures were present only in GPAT2 subexpressing cells, correlating with higher membrane damage evidenced by lactate dehydrogenase release. These GPAT2-induced changes are consistent with its proposed function as a tumor-promoting gene, and might be used as a phenotypic differentiation marker. AFM provides the basis for the identification and quantification of those changes, and demonstrates the utility of this technique in the study of cancer cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2772529304,"The elucidation of the cellular processes involved in vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis is a challenging task. The conventional approaches to these investigations rely on the discovery and purification of the products (i.e proteins and metabolites) of a particular transport or biosynthetic pathway, prior to their subsequent analysis. However, the purification of low-abundance proteins or metabolites is a formidable undertaking that presents considerable technical challenges. As a solution, we present an alternative approach to such studies that circumvents the purification step. The proposed approach takes advantage of: (1) the molecular detection capabilities of a riboswitch-based sensor to detect the cellular levels of its cognate molecule, as a means to probe the integrity of the transport and biosynthetic pathways of the target molecule in cells, (2) the high-throughput screening ability of fluorescence-activated cell sorters to isolate cells in which only these specific pathways are disrupted, and (3) the ability of next-generation sequencing to quickly identify the genes of the FACS-sorted populations. This approach was named “RiboFACSeq”. Following their identification by RiboFACSeq, the role of these genes in the presumed pathway needs to be verified through appropriate functional assays. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, an adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)-responsive riboswitch-based sensor was used in this study to demonstrate that RiboFACSeq can be used to track and sort cells carrying genetic mutations in known AdoCbl transport and biosynthesis genes with desirable sensitivity and specificity. This method could potentially be used to elucidate any pathway of interest, as long as a suitable riboswitch-based sensor can be created. We believe that RiboFACSeq would be especially useful for the elucidation of biological pathways in which the proteins and/or their metabolites are present at very low physiological concentrations in cells, as is the case with vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2775471430,"Purpose To develop a generative mathematical model of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and model the impact of injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor to virtual patients with the condition. Methods We isolated key pathophysiological components of macular degeneration in terms of macular edema development and response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. We developed mathematical models for each of these components using constants determined from published biological experimentation. Consequently, we combined the mathematical models of the separate components to arrive at an end-to-end model of the evolution of macular edema size and its response to treatment. Results We present a series of simulations based upon our idealised model. Initially, we demonstrate the theoretical change in macular edema height in wet macular degeneration over time without and with anti-VEGF interventions. In our final simulation, we demonstrate the powerful possibilities of virtual clinical trials by simulating a virtual model of a landmark study using our existing mathematical AMD model. Conclusions Using our mathematical modelling based upon known pathological and pharmacological processes we have been able to model the effect of intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF agent on macular edema from age related macular degeneration. We were subsequently able to mathematically simulate a major clinical trial with results that mirror many key features of the clinical established study. We anticipate that the generative model presented here can evolve to be a useful supportive tool in the challenge to deliver optimal therapy for patients with wet macular degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2772964796,"The most common explosives can be uniquely identified by measuring the elemental H/N ratio with a precision better than 10%. Monte Carlo simulations were used to design two variants of a new prompt gamma neutron activation instrument that can achieve this precision. The instrument features an intense pulsed neutron generator with precise timing. Measuring the hydrogen peak from the target explosive is especially challenging because the instrument itself contains hydrogen, which is needed for neutron moderation and shielding. By iterative design optimization, the fraction of the hydrogen peak counts coming from the explosive under interrogation increased from [Formula: see text]% to [Formula: see text]% (statistical only) for the benchmark design. In the optimized design variants, the hydrogen signal from a high-explosive shell can be measured to a statistics-only precision better than 1% in less than 30 minutes for an average neutron production yield of 109 n/s."
https://openalex.org/W2773265068,"To monitor population trends of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in Alaska, newborn pups are counted during aerial surveys. These surveys are scheduled to occur after the majority of pups are born, but before pups begin to spend significant time in the water. Some studies have reported dispersal of mother-pup pairs away from breeding beaches during the pupping season (July), which may influence survey results. Using a multistate mark-recapture model with state uncertainty, we estimated the amount of dispersal during the pupping season based on observations of permanently marked sea lions. Research was conducted at land-based observation sites on Marmot Island, Alaska, between 2000 and 2013. Both marked adult females with dependent pups and marked pups were observed at two rookery beaches from May to July. Cumulative dispersal rates were minimal (< 1%) prior to the planned start of the aerial survey (23 June) and increased to 11.2% by the planned survey completion date (10 July). The increased cumulative dispersal rate during the remainder of the observation period (end of July) suggests potential bias in surveys that occur beyond 10 July, however surveys past this date are rare (< 10% between 1973 and 2016). As a result, movements of mother-pup pairs during the pupping season are not likely to influence aerial survey estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2774011622,"Rodent genomic alignment sequences support a 2-exon model for muscarinic M4 receptor. Using this model a novel N-terminal extension was discovered in the human muscarinic acetylcholine M4 receptor. An open reading frame was discovered in the human, mouse and rat with a common ATG (methionine start codon) that extended the N-terminus of the muscarinic acetylcholine M4 receptor subtype by 155 amino acids resulting in a longer variant. Transcriptional evidence for this splice variant was confirmed by RNA-Seq and RT-PCR experiments performed from human donor brain prefrontal cortices. We detected a human upstream exon indicating the translation of the mature longer M4 receptor transcript. The predicted size for the longer two-exon M4 receptor splice variant with the additional 155 amino acid N-terminal extension, designated M4L is 69.7 kDa compared to the 53 kDa canonical single exon M4 receptor (M4S). Western blot analysis from a mammalian overexpression system, and saturation radioligand binding with [3H]-NMS (N-methyl-scopolamine) demonstrated the expression of this new splice variant. Comparative pharmacological characterization between the M4L and M4S receptors revealed that both the orthosteric and allosteric binding sites for both receptors were very similar despite the addition of an N-terminal extension."
