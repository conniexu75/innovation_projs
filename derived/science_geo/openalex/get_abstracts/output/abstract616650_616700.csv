https://openalex.org/W2886498337,"Cancer treatment by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can bring long-lasting clinical benefits, but only a fraction of patients respond to treatment. To predict ICB response, we developed TIDE, a computational method to model two primary mechanisms of tumor immune evasion: the induction of T cell dysfunction in tumors with high infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and the prevention of T cell infiltration in tumors with low CTL level. We identified signatures of T cell dysfunction from large tumor cohorts by testing how the expression of each gene in tumors interacts with the CTL infiltration level to influence patient survival. We also modeled factors that exclude T cell infiltration into tumors using expression signatures from immunosuppressive cells. Using this framework and pre-treatment RNA-Seq or NanoString tumor expression profiles, TIDE predicted the outcome of melanoma patients treated with first-line anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 more accurately than other biomarkers such as PD-L1 level and mutation load. TIDE also revealed new candidate ICB resistance regulators, such as SERPINB9, demonstrating utility for immunotherapy research."

https://openalex.org/W2887187316,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy provides remarkable clinical gains and has been very successful in treatment of melanoma. However, only a subset of patients with advanced tumors currently benefit from ICB therapies, which at times incur considerable side effects and costs. Constructing predictors of patient response has remained a serious challenge because of the complexity of the immune response and the shortage of large cohorts of ICB-treated patients that include both 'omics' and response data. Here we build immuno-predictive score (IMPRES), a predictor of ICB response in melanoma which encompasses 15 pairwise transcriptomics relations between immune checkpoint genes. It is based on two key conjectures: (i) immune mechanisms underlying spontaneous regression in neuroblastoma can predict melanoma response to ICB, and (ii) key immune interactions can be captured via specific pairwise relations of the expression of immune checkpoint genes. IMPRES is validated on nine published datasets1-6 and on a newly generated dataset with 31 patients treated with anti-PD-1 and 10 with anti-CTLA-4, spanning 297 samples in total. It achieves an overall accuracy of AUC = 0.83, outperforming existing predictors and capturing almost all true responders while misclassifying less than half of the nonresponders. Future studies are warranted to determine the value of the approach presented here in other cancer types."

https://openalex.org/W2887579551,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) extends longevity in experimental organisms, raising interest in its impact on human health. De novo NAD+ biosynthesis from tryptophan is evolutionarily conserved yet considered supplanted among higher species by biosynthesis from nicotinamide (NAM). Here we show that a bottleneck enzyme in de novo biosynthesis, quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), defends renal NAD+ and mediates resistance to acute kidney injury (AKI). Following murine AKI, renal NAD+ fell, quinolinate rose, and QPRT declined. QPRT+/- mice exhibited higher quinolinate, lower NAD+, and higher AKI susceptibility. Metabolomics suggested an elevated urinary quinolinate/tryptophan ratio (uQ/T) as an indicator of reduced QPRT. Elevated uQ/T predicted AKI and other adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. A phase 1 placebo-controlled study of oral NAM demonstrated a dose-related increase in circulating NAD+ metabolites. NAM was well tolerated and was associated with less AKI. Therefore, impaired NAD+ biosynthesis may be a feature of high-risk hospitalizations for which NAD+ augmentation could be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W2886522065,"Childhood high-risk neuroblastomas with MYCN gene amplification are difficult to treat effectively1. This has focused attention on tumor-specific gene dependencies that underlie tumorigenesis and thus provide valuable targets for the development of novel therapeutics. Using unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 approaches to detect genes involved in tumor cell growth and survival2-6, we identified 147 candidate gene dependencies selective for MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines, compared to over 300 other human cancer cell lines. We then used genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing analysis to demonstrate that a small number of essential transcription factors-MYCN, HAND2, ISL1, PHOX2B, GATA3, and TBX2-are members of the transcriptional core regulatory circuitry (CRC) that maintains cell state in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. To disable the CRC, we tested a combination of BRD4 and CDK7 inhibitors, which act synergistically, in vitro and in vivo, with rapid downregulation of CRC transcription factor gene expression. This study defines a set of critical dependency genes in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma that are essential for cell state and survival in this tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2885204059,"Coding variants represent many of the strongest associations between genotype and phenotype; however, they exhibit inter-individual differences in effect, termed ‘variable penetrance’. Here, we study how cis-regulatory variation modifies the penetrance of coding variants. Using functional genomic and genetic data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), we observed that in the general population, purifying selection has depleted haplotype combinations predicted to increase pathogenic coding variant penetrance. Conversely, in cancer and autism patients, we observed an enrichment of penetrance increasing haplotype configurations for pathogenic variants in disease-implicated genes, providing evidence that regulatory haplotype configuration of coding variants affects disease risk. Finally, we experimentally validated this model by editing a Mendelian single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using CRISPR/Cas9 on distinct expression haplotypes with the transcriptome as a phenotypic readout. Our results demonstrate that joint regulatory and coding variant effects are an important part of the genetic architecture of human traits and contribute to modified penetrance of disease-causing variants. Analysis of GTEx, cancer and autism data sets shows that cis-regulatory variation can modify the penetrance of coding variants. Deleterious coding variants on regulatory haplotypes resulting in high expression are enriched in disease cohorts and selected against in general populations."
https://openalex.org/W2886007983,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem developmental disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, whose protein products are negative regulators of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling. Hallmark pathologies of TSC are cortical tubers—regions of dysmorphic, disorganized neurons and glia in the cortex that are linked to epileptogenesis. To determine the developmental origin of tuber cells, we established human cellular models of TSC by CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene editing of TSC1 or TSC2 in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Using heterozygous TSC2 hPSCs with a conditional mutation in the functional allele, we show that mosaic biallelic inactivation during neural progenitor expansion is necessary for the formation of dysplastic cells and increased glia production in three-dimensional cortical spheroids. Our findings provide support for the second-hit model of cortical tuber formation and suggest that variable developmental timing of somatic mutations could contribute to the heterogeneity in the neurological presentation of TSC. CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene editing of TSC1 and TSC2 in human pluripotent stem cells is used to investigate the contribution of tuberous sclerosis complex–mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling to human neural development in two-dimensional monolayer and three-dimensional spheroid models of the neurodevelopmental disorder tuberous sclerosis complex."
https://openalex.org/W2886921828,"In vivo calcium imaging from axons provides direct interrogation of afferent neural activity, informing the neural representations that a local circuit receives. Unlike in somata and dendrites, axonal recording of neural activity-both electrically and optically-has been difficult to achieve, thus preventing comprehensive understanding of neuronal circuit function. Here we developed an active transportation strategy to enrich GCaMP6, a genetically encoded calcium indicator, uniformly in axons with sufficient brightness, signal-to-noise ratio, and photostability to allow robust, structure-specific imaging of presynaptic activity in awake mice. Axon-targeted GCaMP6 enables frame-to-frame correlation for motion correction in axons and permits subcellular-resolution recording of axonal activity in previously inaccessible deep-brain areas. We used axon-targeted GCaMP6 to record layer-specific local afferents without contamination from somata or from intermingled dendrites in the cortex. We expect that axon-targeted GCaMP6 will facilitate new applications in investigating afferent signals relayed by genetically defined neuronal populations within and across specific brain regions."

https://openalex.org/W2888165459,"Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome (PLS) is characterized by nonfunctional neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) and fulminant periodontal inflammation of unknown cause. Here we investigated neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-associated aggregation and cytokine/chemokine-release/degradation by normal and NSP-deficient human and mouse granulocytes. Stimulated with solid or soluble NET inducers, normal neutrophils formed aggregates and both released and degraded cytokines/chemokines. With increasing cell density, proteolytic degradation outweighed release. Maximum output of cytokines/chemokines occurred mostly at densities between 2 × 107 and 4 × 107 neutrophils/cm3. Assessment of neutrophil density in vivo showed that these concentrations are surpassed during inflammation. Association with aggregated NETs conferred protection of neutrophil elastase against αl-antitrypsin. In contrast, eosinophils did not influence cytokine/chemokine concentrations. The proteolytic degradation of inflammatory mediators seen in NETs was abrogated in Papillon–Lèfevre syndrome (PLS) neutrophils. In summary, neutrophil-driven proteolysis of inflammatory mediators works as a built-in safeguard for inflammation. The absence of this negative feedback mechanism might be responsible for the nonresolving periodontitis seen in PLS.—Hahn, J., Schauer, C., Czegley, C., Kling, L., Petru, L., Schmid, B., Weidner, D., Reinwald, C., Biermann, M.

https://openalex.org/W2887941197,"Ordering of ferroelectric polarization1 and its trajectory in response to an electric field2 are essential for the operation of non-volatile memories3, transducers4 and electro-optic devices5. However, for voltage control of capacitance and frequency agility in telecommunication devices, domain walls have long been thought to be a hindrance because they lead to high dielectric loss and hysteresis in the device response to an applied electric field6. To avoid these effects, tunable dielectrics are often operated under piezoelectric resonance conditions, relying on operation well above the ferroelectric Curie temperature7, where tunability is compromised. Therefore, there is an unavoidable trade-off between the requirements of high tunability and low loss in tunable dielectric devices, which leads to severe limitations on their figure of merit. Here we show that domain structure can in fact be exploited to obtain ultralow loss and exceptional frequency selectivity without piezoelectric resonance. We use intrinsically tunable materials with properties that are defined not only by their chemical composition, but also by the proximity and accessibility of thermodynamically predicted strain-induced, ferroelectric domain-wall variants8. The resulting gigahertz microwave tunability and dielectric loss are better than those of the best film devices by one to two orders of magnitude and comparable to those of bulk single crystals. The measured quality factors exceed the theoretically predicted zero-field intrinsic limit owing to domain-wall fluctuations, rather than field-induced piezoelectric oscillations, which are usually associated with resonance. Resonant frequency tuning across the entire L, S and C microwave bands (1–8 gigahertz) is achieved in an individual device—a range about 100 times larger than that of the best intrinsically tunable material. These results point to a rich phase space of possible nanometre-scale domain structures that can be used to surmount current limitations, and demonstrate a promising strategy for obtaining ultrahigh frequency agility and low-loss microwave devices. The domain-wall structure and dynamics are found to enhance, rather than inhibit, the high-frequency performance of an intrinsically tunable material, obtaining ultralow loss and exceptional frequency selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2887744121,"We report the development of soluble expression phage-assisted continuous evolution (SE-PACE), a system for rapidly evolving proteins with increased soluble expression. Through use of a PACE-compatible AND gate that uses a split-intein pIII, SE-PACE enables two simultaneous positive selections to evolve proteins with improved expression while maintaining their desired activities. In as little as three days, SE-PACE evolved several antibody fragments with >5-fold improvement in expression yield while retaining binding activity. We also developed an activity-independent form of SE-PACE to correct folding-defective variants of maltose-binding protein (MBP) and to evolve variants of the eukaryotic cytidine deaminase APOBEC1 with improved expression properties. These evolved APOBEC1 variants were found to improve the expression and apparent activity of Cas9-derived base editors when used in place of the wild-type cytidine deaminase. Together, these results suggest that SE-PACE can be applied to a wide variety of proteins to rapidly improve their soluble expression."
https://openalex.org/W2888191704,"Aging is associated with diminished muscle mass, reductions in muscle stem cell functions, and increased muscle fibrosis. The immune system, especially macrophages, can have important roles in modulating muscle growth and regeneration, suggesting that the immune system may also have significant influences on muscle aging. Moreover, the immune system experiences changes in function during senescence, suggesting that regulatory interaction between muscle cells and the immune system may also change during aging. In this study, we performed bone marrow transplantations between age-mismatched donor and recipient mice to test the influence of the age of the immune system on muscle aging. Transplantation of young bone marrow cells into old recipients prevented sarcopenia and prevented age-related change in muscle fiber phenotype. Transplantation of old bone marrow cells into young animals reduced satellite cell numbers and promoted satellite cells to switch toward a fibrogenic phenotype. We also demonstrated that conditioned media from young, but not old, bone marrow cells promoted myoblast proliferation in vitro, and we found that factors released by young bone marrow cells were more supportive of myotube differentiation in vitro. Together, our results demonstrate that aging of bone marrow cells promotes the age-related reduction of satellite cell number and function and contributes to sarcopenia.—Wang, Y., Wehling-Henricks, M., Welc, S.

https://openalex.org/W2888008154,"The retinal degeneration model rd10 contains a missense mutation of the catalytic PDE6 β subunit, which hydrolyzes cGMP in response to light. This model produces cell death more slowly than others caused by PDE6 loss of function, making it of particular interest for studying potential therapeutics. We used morphology, biochemistry, and single-cell physiology to examine the mechanism of rd10 degeneration. Our results show that the mutation produces no alteration of Pde6b RNA but does dramatically decrease maximal and basal PDE6 activity, apparently caused by a decrease in protein stability and transport. The enzymatic properties of the remaining mutant PDE6 appear to be nearly normal. We demonstrate that an increase in free cGMP, which would result from decreased PDE6 activity and serve to increase opening of the cGMP-gated channels and calcium influx, is an underlying cause of cell death: degeneration of rd10/Cngb1−/− double mutants is slower than the parent rd10 line. Paradoxically, degeneration in rd10/Cngb1−/− is also slower than in Cngb1−/−. This rescue is correlated with a lowering of cGMP content in Cngb1−/− retinas and suggests that it may be caused by mislocalization of active PDE6. Single-cell recordings from rd10 rods show that the rates of rise and decay of the response are significantly slower; simulations indicate that these changes are primarily the result of the decrease in PDE6 concentration and rod collecting area. Together, these results provide insights into the complex mechanisms that underlie rd10-mediated retinal degeneration and a cautionary note for analysis of therapeutic interventions.

https://openalex.org/W2888260231,"Objective To evaluate the potential signaling effect of the Mexican tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) by analyzing the association between awareness of and opinions about its effectiveness with current consumption of taxed SSBs and with a self-reported change in consumption of SSBs since the implementation of the tax. We also examined the association between psychosocial and environmental determinants of SSB consumption with current consumption of taxed SSBs and with a reported change in consumption of SSBs. Methods Cross-sectional analyses of survey and food-frequency questionnaire data from the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey 2016. Participants were Mexican adults (20–59 years, N = 6,650). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the probability of a person reporting a decrease in SSB consumption, given their awareness of the tax, opinion about its effectiveness, psychosocial (SSB health-related beliefs, self-efficacy, and liking of SSBs) and environmental (availability of potable water) determinants. Multiple linear regression analysis was utilized to examine the association between the aforementioned factors and current consumption of taxed SSBs. Results Compared with adults not aware, adults who were aware of the SSB tax were more likely (OR = 1.30) to report a decrease in SSB consumption (p = .012). In urban areas, adults aware of the tax drank a significantly lower amount of taxed SSBs (-15.7%; p = .023) than those not aware. Self-efficacy and liking of SSBs were significantly associated with a reported decrease in consumption and with current consumption (p < .001), while health beliefs and availability of potable water were not significantly associated with either reported change in SSB consumption or current consumption of taxed SSBs. Conclusions Implementation of an SSB tax accompanied by highly visible campaigns may further influence the impact of taxes on SSBs consumption. Future public health and nutrition education campaigns designed to increase knowledge and enhance motivation should be complemented by programs to assist individuals develop self-efficacy and self-regulation skills."

Further, we demonstrate that DRD2 promotes self-renewal in these cells via a STAT3- and IL-6–dependent mechanism. We also show that thioridazine induces a G1 arrest and a loss in cell viability in all tested cell lines. However, the reduction in proliferation and cell viability is independent of DRD2 and STAT3.

Despite these discoveries, the molecular mechanisms by which antipsychotics such as thioridazine lead to reduced cancer cell growth and survival are still unclear. Several studies of the effects of thioridazine have been performed using high concentrations (10–20 μm) of drug (9.Sachlos E. Risueño R.M. Laronde S. Shapovalova Z. Lee J.-H. Russell J. Malig M.

It remains unclear whether certain cell types may be more or less sensitive to treatment with antipsychotics, whether thioridazine can inhibit self-renewal effects independent of cell toxicity, and whether these effects are mediated by inhibition of DRD2 as is generally assumed. However, it is clear that DRD2-targeting antipsychotic compounds have very strong effects on many cell types. STAT3 is an inducible transcription factor that has been shown to promote proliferation, prevent apoptosis, and affect cellular differentiation (17.Yu H. Lee H. Herrmann A. Buettner R. Jove R.

STAT3 is one of six STAT family transcription factors that are primarily known for roles in pathogen response and inflammation (18.Stark G.R. Darnell J.E.

Not only has STAT3 been shown to promote self-renewal in cancer stem cells and normal embryonic stem cells, but its activation also increases breast cancer proliferation and invasion (19.Marotta L.L.C.

A number of stimuli are capable of activating STAT3, including the widely studied cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 forms a complex with IL-6 receptor and GP130 and activates the tyrosine kinase activity of GP130. Active GP130 can phosphorylate and activate members of the JAK tyrosine kinase family, which then activate STAT3 by phosphorylating Tyr-705 (24.Hunter C.A. Jones S.A.

Importantly, IL-6 is also a target gene of STAT3, and a feed-forward loop can be established that leads to chronically activated STAT3. Studies indicate that chronically activated STAT3/IL-6 promotes more aggressive and drug-resistant breast cancers (25.Sonnenblick A. Brohée S. Fumagalli D. Vincent D. Venet D. Ignatiadis M.

Although receptor tyrosine kinase signaling is a well-studied mode of STAT3 activation, GPCRs such as S1P1R have been shown to promote STAT3 activation by directly binding to JAKs (28.Lee H. Deng J.

Intriguingly, D2-like receptors have been shown to promote proliferation by activating tyrosine kinase activity (29.Luo Y. Kokkonen G.C. Hattori A. Chrest F.J. Roth G.S. Dopamine stimulates redox–tyrosine kinase signaling and p38 MAPK in activation of astrocytic C6-D2L cells.Brain Res. 1999; 850 (10629745): 21-3810.1016/S0006-8993(99)02021-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30.Lajiness M.E.

Whereas high STAT3 activity is associated with more aggressive cancers, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) in particular are associated with high STAT3 activity (20.Wei W. Tweardy D.J. Zhang M. Zhang X. Landua J. Petrovic I. Bu W. Roarty K. Hilsenbeck S.G. Rosen J.M. Lewis M.T.

Previous work from our lab has also shown that IL-6 is a critical factor for the maintenance of tumor initiating cells in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (TNBCLs) (31.Kendellen M.F. Bradford J.W. Lawrence C.L. Clark K.S. Baldwin A.S. Canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling promotes breast cancer tumor-initiating cells.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (23474754): 1297-130510.1038/onc.2013.64Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Triple-negative breast cancer is a subtype of breast cancer that lacks the expression of the HER2, estrogen, and progesterone receptors. Consequently, there are no targeted therapies for TNBC, which has a poor prognosis compared with other breast cancer subtypes (32.Bianchini G. Balko J.M. Mayer I.A. Sanders M.E. Gianni L. Triple-negative breast cancer: Challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous disease.Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2016; 13 (27184417): 674-69010.1038/nrclinonc.2016.66Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the DRD2-targeting drug thioridazine inhibits the self-renewal of some TNBCLs, but not others. At higher concentrations, thioridazine can induce a G1 arrest and block cell viability in all tested TNBCLs. We demonstrate that the inhibition of self-renewal depends on DRD2 and activated STAT3. However, the strong reduction in cell viability is not only independent of STAT3 activity, but also independent of DRD2. Thioridazine, a DRD2 inhibitor, has been reported to decrease cancer cell proliferation and stemness in leukemia, glioblastoma, and colorectal, lung, and breast cancer cell lines (9.Sachlos E.

Ther. 1992; 263 (1403784): 186-193PubMed Google Scholar). DRD2 mRNA expression across different breast cancer subtypes was assessed using TCGA data. It is interesting to note the wide range in variability of DRD2 expression in all tumor subtypes (Fig. S1). Overall, basal-like and lobular tumors had highest average expression of DRD2 compared with other breast cancer subtypes (Fig. S1). Because basal-like tumors are predominantly triple-negative, the effects of thioridazine were assessed on a panel of triple-negative cell lines (33.Perou C.M. Molecular stratification of triple-negative breast cancers.Oncologist. 2010; 15 (21138954): 39-4810.1634/theoncologist.2010-S5-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although high expression was also observed in lobular breast cancer, our group has previously studied the self-renewal of triple-negative breast cancers (31.Kendellen M.F. Bradford J.W. Lawrence C.L. Clark K.S. Baldwin A.S. Canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling promotes breast cancer tumor-initiating cells.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (23474754): 1297-130510.1038/onc.2013.64Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), so we studied the effects of DRD2-targeted antipsychotics in TNBCLs. To test whether thioridazine has effects on the self-renewal of TNBCLs, the in vitro tumorsphere assay was used. Six triple-negative cell lines were treated with DMSO, 1 μm, 2 μm, or 5 μm thioridazine once and were cultured for 7 days before the number of spheres was counted. Interestingly, some TNBCLs (SUM149, HCC1143, HCC1937) were found to be sensitive where thioridazine caused a dose-dependent decrease in tumorsphere number; whereas others (SUM159, MDA-MB-231, HCC38) were resistant, showing no significant decrease in tumorsphere numbers at these concentrations of thioridazine (Fig. 1A). To more stringently test whether thioridazine inhibits self-renewal, secondary tumorsphere formation of SUM149 and SUM159 cells was tested in the presence of thioridazine. Indeed, thioridazine treatment inhibits secondary tumorsphere formation of SUM149 cells, but not of SUM159 cells (Fig. 1B). Because thioridazine is an inhibitor of DRD2, the observed differences in sensitivity were predicted to arise from expression of DRD2. Although HCC1143 cells have abundant expression of DRD2 compared with the other TNBCLs, DRD2 mRNA expression did not correlate with whether thioridazine will inhibit sphere formation (Fig. 1C). Perhaps thioridazine inhibits sphere formation in SUM149 cells but not SUM159 cells because DRD2 is more highly expressed in the sphere-forming cells in the SUM149 cell line. To test this, DRD2 mRNA expression was measured in tumorspheres relative to adherently grown SUM149 and SUM159 cells. Indeed, DRD2 is expressed more highly in SUM149 tumorspheres than in adherently grown cells (Fig. S2). However, it is also expressed more highly in SUM159 tumorspheres than in adherently grown cells (Fig. S2). This suggests that the lack of response in SUM159 tumorspheres is not because of low or absent expression of the receptor. We are unable to specifically detect DRD2 protein by Western blotting as antibodies against dopamine receptors, as is the case with some other GPCRs, are known to be nonspecific (34.Stojanovic T. Orlova M. Sialana F.J. Höger H. Stuchlik S. Milenkovic I. Aradska J. Lubec G.

A decrease in tumorsphere formation may be caused by inhibited self-renewal, or indirectly via reduced cell proliferation or increased death.

To test the effects of thioridazine on adherently grown TNBCLs, cell viability was measured by detecting ATP abundance after 72 h of thioridazine treatment. In agreement with studies on other cancer cell lines, thioridazine dramatically reduced cell viability in TNBCLs at higher doses (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, there is only a 3-fold range in the IC50 of thioridazine across all six TNBCLs tested (Table 1). We confirmed these results on SUM149 and SUM159 cells by counting cell numbers after 72 h of thioridazine exposure. Both the SUM149 cells and the SUM159 cells show reduced cell numbers when treated with 2 μm or 5 μm, but not 1 μm thioridazine (Fig. 1, E and F). Fewer SUM149 cells are counted after 2–4 days of 5 μm thioridazine (Fig. 1E). On the other hand, there are SUM159 cells still growing when treated with 5 μm thioridazine (Fig."

We investigated the effect of healthy human HDL and CAD-HDL on TNF-α–driven inflammation in VSMCs and examined whether HDL-associated sphingosine-1-phosphate (HDL-S1P) could modulate inflammation with the aim of designing novel HDL-based anti-inflammatory strategies. Healthy human HDL, human CAD-HDL, and mouse HDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation, S1P was measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, and TNF-α–induced inflammation was characterized by gene expression and analysis of NF-κB–dependent signaling. Mechanisms of S1P interference with TNF-α were assessed by S1P receptor antagonists, mouse knockouts, and short interfering RNA. We observed that healthy HDL potently inhibited the induction of TNF-α-stimulated inflammatory genes, such as iNOS (inducible NO synthase) and MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), a process that was entirely dependent on HDL-S1P, as evidenced by loss-of-function using S1P-less HDL and mimicked by genuine S1P. Inhibition was based on suppression of TNF-α–activated Akt signaling resulting in reduced IkBαSer32 and p65Ser534 NF-κB phosphorylation based on a persistent phosphatase and tensin homolog activation by S1P through the S1P receptor 2. Intriguingly, S1P suppressed inflammation even hours after initial TNF-α stimulation. The anti-inflammatory effect of healthy HDL correlated with HDL-S1P content and was superior to that of CAD-HDL featuring lower HDL-S1P. Nevertheless, therapeutic loading of HDL with S1P completely restored the antiinflammatory capacity of CAD-HDL and greatly boosted that of both healthy and CAD-HDL. Suppression of inflammation by HDL-S1P defines a novel pathophysiologic characteristic that distinguishes functional from dysfunctional HDL. The anti-inflammatory HDL function can be boosted by S1P-loading and exploited by S1P receptor-targeting to prevent and even turn off ongoing inflammation.—Keul, P., Polzin, A., Kaiser, K., Gräler, M., Dannenberg, L., Daum, G., Heusch, G., Levkau, B.

Recent evidence from genetic mouse models shows that circulating RBP4 derives exclusively from hepatocytes. Because RBP4 is elevated in obesity and associates with the development of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, we tested whether a liver-specific overexpression of RBP4 in mice impairs glucose homeostasis. We used adeno-associated viruses (AAV) that contain a highly liver-specific promoter to drive expression of murine RBP4 in livers of adult mice. The resulting increase in serum RBP4 levels in these mice was comparable with elevated levels that were reported in obesity. Surprisingly, we found that increasing circulating RBP4 had no effect on glucose homeostasis. Also during a high-fat diet challenge, elevated levels of RBP4 in the circulation failed to aggravate the worsening of systemic parameters of glucose and energy homeostasis. These findings show that liver-secreted RBP4 does not impair glucose homeostasis. We conclude that a modest increase of its circulating levels in mice, as observed in the obese, insulin-resistant state, is unlikely to be a causative factor for impaired glucose homeostasis. Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is the major transport protein for retinol in blood. Recent evidence from genetic mouse models shows that circulating RBP4 derives exclusively from hepatocytes.

These findings supported the notion of RBP4 working as adipokine, and it was hypothesized that an increased expression in adipose tissue of obese subjects leads to higher serum levels that, in turn, induce insulin resistance. So far, a variety of mechanisms of how RBP4 causes glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were reported (12Fedders R. Muenzner M. Schupp M.

A recent study showed that circulating RBP4 derives exclusively from hepatocytes because it was undetectable in serum of mice with a hepatocyte-specific deletion of RBP4 (15Thompson S.J. Sargsyan A.

Another study reported that transgenic expression of RBP4 in adipose tissue failed to increase circulating levels of RBP4 (16Lee S.A. Yuen J.J. Jiang H. Kahn B.B. Blaner W.S.

Thus, RBP4 is unlikely to be an adipokine in the classical sense, suggesting that the elevation of serum RBP4 in obesity and diabetes is due to other effects, such as impaired renal clearance of RBP4 (7Raila J.

Whether these abnormalities interfere with the control of glucose homeostasis is unknown. To test whether liver-secreted RBP4 impairs glucose homeostasis and to further delineate the underlying mechanisms, we opted to generate a system without the limitations of the current mouse models. We decided on a strategy that expresses mouse RBP4, and not the human protein, in a highly liver-specific manner in fully developed, adult mice. We used adeno-associated viruses (AAV) that express GFP or mouse RBP4 under the control of the synthetic and highly liver-specific LP1 promoter (22Nathwani A.C. Tuddenham E.G. Rangarajan S.

Surprisingly, mice with elevated levels of RBP4 failed to develop any metabolic phenotype when fed a normal chow (NC) or during a HFD challenge when compared with GFP controls. These findings show that liver-secreted RBP4 does not interfere with glucose homeostasis in mice. They also support the notion that the elevated levels of RBP4 in serum of obese/insulin-resistance individuals are not causative for impaired glucose homeostasis. We generated a model of liver-specific RBP4 overexpression by a nongenomic intervention in adult mice, thus excluding developmental compensations and potential unspecific effects due to genomic reorganization. AAV was chosen because of long-term expression of the transgene and low immunogenicity (23Wang L. Wang H. Bell P. McCarter R.J. He J. Calcedo R. Vandenberghe L.H. Morizono H. Batshaw M.L. Wilson J.M.

Liver-specific overexpression of RBP4 increased serum RBP4 by 2–3-fold, irrespective of feeding NC (week 3) or HFD (week 24) (Fig. 2, B and C). Circulating RBP4 levels correlated well with serum retinol, suggesting that AAV-mediated RBP4 expression is functional, mobilizing hepatic retinyl ester stores (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, obese mice exhibited higher retinol levels in serum, which is in line with previous reports (16Lee S.A. Yuen J.J. Jiang H. Kahn B.B. Blaner W.S. Adipocyte-specific over-expression of retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) causes hepatic steatosis in mice.Hepatology. 2016; 64 (27227735): 1534-154610.1002/hep.28659Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Trasino S.E.

Tuvia N. Deutschmann C. Witte N. Tolkachov A. Valai A. Henze A. Sander L.E. Raila J. Schupp M. Retinol-binding protein 4 and its membrane receptor STRA6 control adipogenesis by regulating cellular retinoid homeostasis and retinoic acid receptor α activity.Mol. Cell.

The underlying mechanisms that lead to increased holo-RBP4/retinol in serum of HFD-fed mice are still unclear but may involve alterations in hepatic RBP4 secretion, its renal clearance, and tissue retinol uptake. To further test whether AAV-mediated RBP4 expression is functional, we determined circulating levels of apo- and holo-RBP4 by nondenaturating PAGE. Consistent with increased retinol, liver-specific overexpression of RBP4 increased the abundance of circulating holo-RBP4 (Fig. 2, E and F). Retinol-free apo-RBP4, on the other hand, was highly variable in our mouse cohort and not affected by RBP4 overexpression (Fig. 2, E and F). GFP/RBP4-expressing mice did not differ in body weights when kept on NC (Fig. 3A). Blood glucose levels of ad libitum-fed mice expressing RBP4 tended to be lower at 2 and 3 weeks after AAV injections but failed to reach statistical significance (Fig. 3B). Serum insulin levels were similar (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, glucose tolerance and serum insulin levels 15 min after the intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of glucose (2 g/kg) did not differ between groups (Fig. 3, D and E). We also determined daily food intake and found no differences between GFP and RBP4 overexpressing mice (Fig. 3F). These findings show that liver-secreted RBP4, when elevated to levels as seen in the obese, insulin-resistant state, does not impair glucose homeostasis. We hypothesized that healthy, NC-fed mice may compensate the detrimental effect of elevated RBP4. Therefore, NC-fed mice were switched to HFD and characterized as shown in Fig. 2A. Both total weights and % weight gain were similar between RBP4 and GFP mice (Fig. 4, A and B), and there was no difference in body fat content (Fig. 4C). Fasting blood glucose was robustly increased in HFD-fed compared with NC-fed mice, indicating that HFD-induced obesity results in insulin resistance. However, there were no differences between GFP and RBP4 mice (Fig. 4D). Also ad libitum-fed blood glucose levels were similar (Fig. 4E). Strikingly, liver-specific overexpression of RBP4 failed to affect glucose tolerance and serum insulin levels 15 min after the i.p. injection of glucose (0.5 g/kg) in these HFD-fed mice (Fig. 4, F and G). At week 24, serum nonesterified fatty acid levels, triglycerides, and ketone bodies were not changed (Table S2). Also liver triglycerides and glycogen levels were comparable (Table S3). To address energy metabolism in more detail, HFD-fed mice were placed in a TSE LabMaster system. As expected for this diet, on which fat rather than carbohydrates are being utilized, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was close to 0.7 and did not differ between groups (Fig. 5A). Energy expenditure was higher in the active (dark) phase of mice without showing differences between GFP and RBP4 mice (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained for locomotor activity (Fig. 5C). Also food intake did not differ between both groups (Fig. 5D). These findings suggest that liver-RBP4 overexpression and a ∼2-fold increase in circulating RBP4 levels do not affect energy metabolism in mice. We next analyzed hepatic gene expression. Rbp4 was increased 3.5-fold (Fig. 6A), further validating our model of modest RBP4 overexpression in liver. Hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) expression was previously shown to be increased in RBP4 injected mice (4Yang Q. Graham T.E. Mody N. Preitner F.

Rabies is one of the most deadly infectious diseases, with a case fatality rate approaching 100%. Despite availability of effective prevention and control strategies, rabies still kills 50,000 to 60,000 people worldwide annually, the majority of whom are in the developing world. We describe trends and geographical distribution of animal bite injuries (a proxy of potential exposure to rabies) and deaths due to suspected human rabies in Uganda from 2001 to 2015.We used 2001-2015 surveillance data on suspected animal bite injuries, collected from health facilities in Uganda. To describe annual trends, line graphs were used and linear regression tested significance of observed trends at P<0.05. We used maps to describe geographical distribution of animal bites by district.A total of 208,720 cases of animal bite injuries were reported. Of these, 27% were in Central, 22% in Eastern, 27% in Northern and 23% in Western regions. Out of 48,720 animal bites between 2013 and 2015, 59% were suffered by males and 81% were persons aged above 5 years. Between 2001 and 2015, the overall incidence (per 100,000 population) of animal bites was 58 in Uganda, 76 in Northern, 58 in Central, 53 in Western and 50 in Eastern region. From 2001 to 2015, the annual incidence (per 100,000 population) increased from 21 to 47 (P = 0.02) in Central, 27 to 34 (P = 0.04) in Eastern, 23 to 70 (P = 0.01) in Northern and 16 to 46 (P = 0.001) in Western region. A total of 486 suspected human rabies deaths were reported, of which 29% were reported from Eastern, 28% from Central, 27% from Northern and 17% from Western region.Animal bite injuries, a potential exposure to rabies infection, and mortality attributed to rabies infection are public health challenges affecting all regions of Uganda. Eliminating rabies requires strengthening of rabies prevention and control strategies at all levels of the health sector. These strategies should utilize the ""One Health"" approach with strategic focus on strengthening rabies surveillance, controlling rabies in dogs and ensuring availability of post exposure prophylaxis at lower health facilities."

In this study, we compare placental shape features in younger siblings of children with ASD, who themselves are at high ASD risk, to a sample of low risk peers. Digital photographs of the fetal placenta surface and of the sliced placental disk from 129 high ASD risk newborns and from 267 newborns in the National Children's Study Vanguard pilot were analysed to extract comparable measures of placental chorionic surface shape, umbilical cord displacement and disk thickness. Placental thickness measures were moderately higher in siblings of ASD cases. The placentas of ASD-case siblings were also rounder and more regular in perimeter than general population placentas. After stratification by sex, these across-group differences persisted for both sexes but were more pronounced in females. No significant differences were observed in cord insertion measures. Variations in placental shape features are generally considered to reflect flexibility in placental growth in response to changes in intrauterine environment as the placenta establishes and matures. Reduced placental shape variability observed in high ASD risk siblings compared to low-risk controls may indicate restricted ability to compensate for intrauterine changes."

It is important to develop genetic methods that confer increased hypoxia tolerance to intensively farmed aquatic species, as these are maintained in environments with limited available oxygen. As an asparaginyl hydroxylase of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) inhibits transcriptional activation of hypoxia-inducible genes by blocking the association of HIFs with the transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300. Therefore, here we sought to test whether fih is involved in regulating hypoxia tolerance in the commonly used zebrafish model. Overexpressing the zebrafish fih gene in epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells and embryos, we found that fih inhibits the transcriptional activation of zebrafish HIF-α proteins. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to obtain fih-null zebrafish mutants, we noted that the fih deletion makes zebrafish more tolerant of hypoxic conditions than their WT siblings, but does not result in oxygen consumption rates that significantly differ from those of WT fish. Of note, we identified fewer apoptotic cells in adult fih-null zebrafish brains and in fih-null embryos, possibly explaining why the fih-null mutant had greater hypoxia tolerance than the WT. Moreover, the fih deletion up-regulated several hypoxia-inducible genes in fih-null zebrafish exposed to hypoxia.

The hypoxia signaling pathway and hypoxic adaptation in fishes.Sci. China Life Sci. 2015; 58 (25595051): 148-15510.1007/s11427-015-4801-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here, we aimed to test whether fih was involved in the tolerance of hypoxic conditions by zebrafish (Danio rerio). We first tested the effects of fih overexpression on the transcriptional activity of zebrafish hif genes. We then knocked out fih in zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9. We found that fih-null zebrafish were more tolerant to hypoxia than their WT siblings, indicating that fih is critical for adaptation to acute hypoxia. The zebrafish fih gene encoded a 344-amino acid protein 79.89% identical to the human FIH gene (Fig. S1). However, unlike in humans, we identified two orthologous copies of each hif gene, hif-1αa and hif-1αb, hif-2αa and hif-2αb in the zebrafish genome. Notably, the asparagine residue supposed hydroxylated by Fih is evolutionarily conserved between the mammalian and zebrafish HIF-α proteins (Figs. S2 and S3). Human HIF-α and zebrafish HIF-α were about 50% identical (human HIF-1α versus zebrafish hif-1αa, 43.21% identity; human HIF-1α versus zebrafish hif-1αb, 55.31% identity; human HIF-2α versus zebrafish hif-2αa, 56.49% identity; and human HIF-2α versus zebrafish hif-2αb, 53.69% identity), whereas zebrafish hif-1αa and hif-1αb were 52.94% identical, and zebrafish hif-2αa and hif-2αb were 55.23% identical. In zebrafish, fih was most highly expressed in the liver, followed by the muscle and the brain (Fig. S4). Our luciferase reporter assays indicated that the overexpression of fih in epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells suppressed the transcriptional activity of the zebrafish genes, hif-1αa, hif-1αb, hif-2αa, and hif-2α/b (Fig. 1, A–D) (26Chen Z. Liu X. Mei Z. Wang Z. Xiao W. EAF2 suppresses hypoxia-induced factor 1 α transcriptional activity by disrupting its interaction with coactivator CBP/p300.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34 (24421387): 1085-109910.1128/MCB.00718-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As expected, the overexpression of fih in EPC cells had no obvious effects on the transcriptional activity of the zebrafish hif-1αb/2αb asparagine site mutants (hif-1αa N754A and hif-2αb N786A) (Fig. 1, B and D) (17Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K.

Surprisingly, the overexpression of fih in EPC cells still suppressed the transcriptional activity of the zebrafish hif-1αa/2αa asparagine site mutants (hif-1αa N694A and hif-2αa N811A) (Fig. 1, A and C). The injection of the fih expression vector into zebrafish embryos inhibited the activity of the hypoxia response element (HRE) reporter when co-injected with hif-1αa, hif-1αb, hif-2αa, or hif-2αb expression vectors (Fig. 2, A–D) (27Emerling B.M.

When embryos injected with fih mRNA were subjected to (5% O2), several well-defined hypoxia-induced genes (including vegf, cited2, pai1, and pdk1) were significantly down-regulated as compared with control embryos injected with GFP mRNA (Fig. 3, A–F) (26Chen Z.

Our data therefore indicated that, similar to the mammalian FIH gene, the zebrafish fih gene suppresses the transcriptional activity of zebrafish Hif-α proteins (17Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J.

Our semiquantitative RT-PCR assays showed that fih mRNA was reduced in both mutant lines as compared with the WT (Fig. S5, C and D), indicating that fih had been successfully knocked out in the two mutant lines. Our observations indicated that fih-null zebrafish developed normally and were generally indistinguishable from their WT siblings. Moreover, the protein levels of hif-1a and hif-2a were enhanced in fih-null zebrafish brains under hypoxia (5% O2), as revealed by Western blotting assays (Fig. S6), further validating loss of fih function in fih-null zebrafish. We next tested whether adult mutant zebrafish (3 months postfertilization (mpf)) were affected by hypoxia differently from their WT siblings. After a 4-h exposure to 5% O2, WT zebrafish were concentrated near the surface of the water, whereas fih-null zebrafish were distributed throughout the water volume (Fig. 4A). After 6 h, the WT zebrafish began dying, but no obvious abnormalities were observed in fih-null zebrafish (Fig. 4B). Between 8 and 14 h of hypoxia, all WT zebrafish died (Fig. 4, C–F). At 14 h, all fih-null zebrafish remained alive; also, they were swimming closer to the surface of the water (Fig. 4, C–F). To quantify these observations, we calculated a survival curve for zebrafish larvae (3 days postfertilization (dpf)) and found that under hypoxic conditions (2% O2), fewer fih-null zebrafish larvae died than their WT siblings (Fig. 4G). We then determined whether the observed differences between WT and fih-null zebrafish were caused by differences in rate of oxygen consumption by comparing the oxygen consumption rate between adult WT and fih-null zebrafish. We found no significant differences in oxygen consumption (Fig. S7). Our data therefore suggest that fih-null zebrafish are more tolerant of hypoxic conditions than WT zebrafish. To investigate why fih-null zebrafish larvae were more tolerant of hypoxia than their WT siblings, we used Acridine orange staining to detect apoptotic cells in zebrafish larvae. Under normoxia, there were no differences in the numbers of apoptotic cells between WT and fih-null zebrafish larvae (Fig. 5A). However, under hypoxic conditions (2% O2), significantly more apoptotic cells were observed in the WT zebrafish larvae as compared with the fih-null larvae (p < 0.005 for 12–60 h of exposure; p < 0.05 for 72 h of exposure; Fig. 5, B and C). We also counted the apoptotic brain cells in adult (3 mpf) fih-null zebrafish and their WT siblings subjected to hypoxic conditions (5% O2) using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays. After 6 h of hypoxia (5% O2), there were significantly more apoptotic cells in the WT zebrafish brains than in the fih-null zebrafish brains (Fig. 6). Therefore, these data suggested that the hypoxic resistance of the fih-null zebrafish might be due to lower rates of hypoxia-induced apoptosis. It has been reported that hypoxia can induce autophagy (28Foster W.G.

Under hypoxia, expression of bnip3, beclin1, or bcl2a was lower in fih-null zebrafish compared with their WT siblings (Fig. S8).

Our semiquantitative RT-PCR assay showed that all tested genes were up-regulated in fih-null zebrafish (M1) as compared with WT zebrafish under hypoxia (Fig. 7, A–E). Our tests with M2 returned similar results (Fig. S9), eliminating the possibility that our results were affected by CRISPR/Cas9 off-targeting. Our data therefore suggested that the knockout of fih increased the transcription of HIF, possibly accounting for the observed increased tolerance of hypoxia observed in fih-null zebrafish. To determine the effect of fih deletion on glucose physiology, blood glucose was measured (Fig. S10). Loss of fih had an effect on glucose clearance, similar to what was exhibited in fih-null mice (22Zhang N. Fu Z. Linke S. Chicher J. Gorman J.J. Visk D. Haddad G.G. Poellinger L. Peet D.J. Powell F.

These data suggest that fih plays a role in glycolysis through modulating HIF-α's function.

One AD hallmark is the aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) into soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils. Several studies have reported that oligomers rather than fibrils are the most toxic species in AD progression. Aβ oligomers bind with high affinity to membrane-associated prion protein (PrP), leading to toxic signaling across the cell membrane, which makes the Aβ–PrP interaction an attractive therapeutic target. Here, probing this interaction in more detail, we found that both full-length, soluble human (hu) PrP(23–230) and huPrP(23–144), lacking the globular C-terminal domain, bind to Aβ oligomers to form large complexes above the megadalton size range. Following purification by sucrose density–gradient ultracentrifugation, the Aβ and huPrP contents in these heteroassemblies were quantified by reversed-phase HPLC. The Aβ:PrP molar ratio in these assemblies exhibited some limited variation depending on the molar ratio of the initial mixture. Specifically, a molar ratio of about four Aβ to one huPrP in the presence of an excess of huPrP(23–230) or huPrP(23–144) suggested that four Aβ units are required to form one huPrP-binding site. Of note, an Aβ-binding all-d-enantiomeric peptide, RD2D3, competed with huPrP for Aβ oligomers and interfered with Aβ–PrP heteroassembly in a concentration-dependent manner. Our results highlight the importance of multivalent epitopes on Aβ oligomers for Aβ–PrP interactions and have yielded an all-d-peptide–based, therapeutically promising agent that competes with PrP for these interactions.

The research reported in this paper seeks to develop a better clinical decision support algorithm for clinicians diagnosis. This paper presents a probabilistic method for detection and segmentation between abnormal tissue regions and brain tumour (tumour core and edema) portions from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A framework is constructed to learn structure of undirected graphical models that can represent the spatial relationships among variables and apply it to glioma segmentation. Compared with the pixel of image, the superpixel is more consistent with human visual cognition and contains less redundancy, thus, the superpixels are considered as the basic unit of structure learning and glioma segmentation scheme. ℓ1-regularization techniques are applied to learn the appropriate structure for modeling graphical models. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are used to model the spatial interactions among image superpixel regions and their measurements. A number of features including statistics features, the combined features from the local binary pattern as well as gray level run length, curve features, and fractal features were extracted from each superpixel. The features are then passed by ℓ1-regularization to ensure a robust classification. The proposed method is compared with support vector machine and Fuzzy c-means to classify each superpixel into normal and abnormal tissue. The proposed system is tested for the presence of low grade as well as high grade glioma tumors on images collected from BRATS2013, BRATS2015 data set and Henan Provincial People’s Hospital (HNPPH) data set. The experiments performed provides similarity between segmented and truth image up to 91.5% by correlation method."

The purpose of this study is to describe the importance of the TZ component Meckel-Grüber syndrome 6 ( Mks6) in several organ systems and tissues regarding ciliogenesis and cilia maintenance using congenital and conditional mutant mouse models. Similar to MKS, congenital loss of Mks6 is embryonic lethal, displaying cilia loss and altered cytoskeletal microtubule modifications but only in specific cell types. Conditional Mks6 mutants have a variable cystic kidney phenotype along with severe retinal degeneration with mislocalization of phototransduction cascade proteins. However, other phenotypes, such as anosmia and obesity, which are typically associated with cilia and TZ dysfunction, were not evident.

While self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA) mitigate exposures to inhalable asphyxiates and carcinogens, firefighters frequently remove SCBA during overhaul when the firegrounds appear clear of visible smoke. Using a mouse model of overhaul without airway protection, the impact of fireground environment exposure on lung gene expression was assessed to identify transcripts potentially critical to firefighter-related chronic pulmonary illnesses. Lung tissue was collected 2 hrs post-overhaul and evaluated via whole genome transcriptomics by RNA-seq. Although gas metering showed that the fireground overhaul levels of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen cyanine (HCN), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and oxygen (O2) were within NIOSH ceiling recommendations, 3852 lung genes were differentially expressed when mice exposed to overhaul were compared to mice on the fireground but outside the overhaul environment. Importantly, overhaul exposure was associated with an up/down-regulation of 86 genes with a fold change of 1.5 or greater (p<0.5) including the immunomodulatory-linked genes S100a8 and Tnfsf9 (downregulation) and the cancer-linked genes, Capn11 and Rorc (upregulation).

https://openalex.org/W2888281041,"Autophagy, a pathway for bulk protein degradation and removal of damaged organelles, represents one of the major responses of cells to stress, thereby exerting a strict control on their correct functioning. Consequently, this process has been involved in the pathogenesis and therapeutic responses of several human diseases. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase 15 (MAPK15) is an atypical member of the MAP kinase family that recently emerged as a key modulator of autophagy and, through this, of cell transformation. Still, no information is available about signaling pathways mediating the effect of MAPK15 on this process, nor is it known which phase of autophagosome biogenesis is affected by this MAP kinase. Here, we demonstrate that MAPK15 stimulated 5′-AMP–activated protein kinase–dependent activity of UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), the only protein kinase among the ATG-related proteins, toward downstream substrates and signaling intermediates. Importantly, MAPK15 directly interacted with the ULK1 complex and mediated ULK1 activation induced by starvation, a classical stimulus for the autophagic process. In turn, ULK1 and its highly homologous protein ULK2 are able to transduce MAPK15 signals stimulating early phases of autophagosomal biogenesis in a multikinase cascade that offers numerous potential targets for future therapeutic intervention in cancer and other autophagy-related human diseases."

Since TPA is an uncultivable bacterium, most of the information on TPA genetics comes from genome sequencing and molecular typing studies. This study presents the first complete TPA genome (without sequencing gaps) of clinical isolate (UZ1974), which was obtained directly from clinical material, without multiplication in rabbits. Whole genome sequencing was performed using a newly developed Anti-Treponemal Antibody Enrichment technique combined with previously reported Pooled Segment Genome Sequencing. We identified the UW074B genome, isolated from a sample previously propagated in rabbits, to be the closest relative of the UZ1974 genome and calculated the TPA mutation rate as 2.8 x 10−10 per site per generation."
https://openalex.org/W2888377938,"Kinomics is an emerging field of science that involves the study of global kinase activity. As kinases are essential players in virtually all cellular activities, kinomic testing can directly examine protein function, distinguishing kinomics from more remote, upstream components of the central dogma, such as genomics and transcriptomics. While there exist several different approaches for kinomic research, peptide microarrays are the most widely used and involve kinase activity assessment through measurement of phosphorylation of peptide substrates on the array. Unfortunately, bioinformatic tools for analyzing kinomic data are quite limited necessitating the development of accessible open access software in order to facilitate standardization and dissemination of kinomic data for scientific use. Here, we examine and present tools for data analysis for the popular PamChip® (PamGene International) kinomic peptide microarray. As a result, we propose (1) a procedural optimization of kinetic curve data capture, (2) new methods for background normalization, (3) guidelines for the detection of outliers during parameterization, and (4) a standardized data model to store array data at various analytical points. In order to utilize the new data model, we developed a series of tools to implement the new methods and to visualize the various data models. In the interest of accessibility, we developed this new toolbox as a series of JavaScript procedures that can be utilized as either server side resources (easily packaged as web services) or as client side scripts (web applications running in the browser). The aggregation of these tools within a Kinomics Toolbox provides an extensible web based analytic platform that researchers can engage directly and web programmers can extend. As a proof of concept, we developed three analytical tools, a technical reproducibility visualizer, an ANOVA based detector of differentially phosphorylated peptides, and a heatmap display with hierarchical clustering."
https://openalex.org/W2888280360,"The relaxin-3 neuropeptide activates the relaxin family peptide 3 (RXFP3) receptor to modulate stress, appetite, and cognition. RXFP3 shows promise as a target for treating neurological disorders, but realization of its clinical potential requires development of smaller RXFP3-specific drugs that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Designing such drugs is challenging and requires structural knowledge of agonist- and antagonist-binding modes. Here, we used structure-activity data for relaxin-3 and a peptide RXFP3 antagonist termed R3 B1-22R to guide receptor mutagenesis and develop models of their binding modes. RXFP3 residues were alanine-substituted individually and in combination and tested in cell-based binding and functional assays to refine models of agonist and antagonist binding to active- and inactive-state homology models of RXFP3, respectively. These models suggested that both agonists and antagonists interact with RXFP3 via similar residues in their B-chain central helix. The models further suggested that the B-chain Trp27 inserts into the binding pocket of RXFP3 and interacts with Trp138 and Lys271, the latter through a salt bridge with the C-terminal carboxyl group of Trp27 in relaxin-3. R3 B1-22R, which does not contain Trp27, used a non-native Arg23 residue to form cation-π and salt-bridge interactions with Trp138 and Glu141 in RXFP3, explaining a key contribution of Arg23 to affinity. Overall, relaxin-3 and R3 B1-22R appear to share similar binding residues but may differ in binding modes, leading to active and inactive RXFP3 conformational states, respectively. These mechanistic insights may assist structure-based drug design of smaller relaxin-3 mimetics to manage neurological disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2888141749,"Pseudomonas is a very large bacterial genus in which several species can use d-malate for growth. However, the enzymes that can metabolize d-malate, such as d-malate dehydrogenase, appear to be absent in most Pseudomonas species. d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (SerA) can catalyze the production of d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2-HG) from 2-ketoglutarate to support d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenation, which is the initial reaction in bacterial l-serine biosynthesis. In this study, we show that SerA of the Pseudomonas stutzeri strain A1501 reduces oxaloacetate to d-malate and that d-2-HG dehydrogenase (D2HGDH) from P. stutzeri displays d-malate–oxidizing activity. Of note, D2HGDH participates in converting a trace amount of d-malate to oxaloacetate during bacterial l-serine biosynthesis. Moreover, D2HGDH is crucial for the utilization of d-malate as the sole carbon source for growth of P. stutzeri A1501. We also found that the D2HGDH expression is induced by the exogenously added d-2-HG or d-malate and that a flavoprotein functions as a soluble electron carrier between D2HGDH and electron transport chains to support d-malate utilization by P. stutzeri. These results support the idea that D2HGDH evolves as an enzyme for both d-malate and d-2-HG dehydrogenation in P. stutzeri. In summary, D2HGDH from P. stutzeri A1501 participates in both a core metabolic pathway for l-serine biosynthesis and utilization of extracellular d-malate."

The Nutrition UP 65 cross-sectional study was conducted in a population-based sample of 1,425 older adults ≥ 65 years old. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were quantified through electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Multinomial logistic regressions were carried out using quartiles of gait speed and of hand grip strength as dependent variables. Participants at risk of vitamin D inadequacy (30.0-49.9 nmol/L) and deficiency (< 30.0 nmol/L) presented higher adjusted odds ratio of the lowest values of gait speed and hand grip strength than those with adequate vitamin D levels (≥ 50.0 nmol/L). These associations were strongest among men at risk of vitamin D deficiency [adjusted odds ratio for the lowest quartile of gait speed = 3.24; 95% CI: 1.56–6.73 and for the lowest quartile of hand grip strength = 3.28; 95% CI: 1.47-7.31] than in women at risk of vitamin D deficiency [adjusted odds ratio for the lowest quartile of gait speed = 2.72; 95% CI: 1.37-5.41 and for the lowest quartile of hand grip strength = 1.56; 95% CI: 0.81–3.00]. In conclusion, in older adults, particularly in men, the risk of vitamin D deficiency was directly associated with the lowest values of gait speed and of hand grip strength. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to overcome the possibility of reverse causation and residual confounding. Present results emphasise the need for strategies to promote the reduction of the high prevalence of low vitamin D status among the Portuguese older adult population."
https://openalex.org/W2888523944,"Cholesterol is an important component of plasma membranes (PMs) and the precursor of all steroid hormones. In steroidogenic tissues, upon hormone stimulation, there is a rapid transfer of cholesterol to the mitochondria, which is the site of the initial step in steroidogenesis. In the current study, we examined PM cholesterol trafficking for steroidogenesis. In a mitochondrial reconstitution assay, adrenal PMs supported steroidogenesis in the absence of additional transport proteins. Depletion of cholesterol in PMs by 50% eliminated the membranes' ability to support steroidogenesis in vitro and reduced steroid production in intact Y1 adrenocortical cells. Syntaxin (STX)-5 and α-soluble N-emylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein (α-SNAP) are enriched in adrenal PMs, and adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment of rats recruited STX5 and α-SNAP to adrenal PMs and mitochondria. Immunodepletion of STX5 and α-SNAP from PMs decreased steroidogenesis supported by PMs in vitro. Protease digestion of PMs decreased, whereas recombinant STX5 or α-SNAP restored, the PMs' ability to support steroidogenesis. Knockdown of either STX5 or α-SNAP in Y1 cells decreased stimulated steroidogenesis. These results indicate that STX5 and α-SNAP facilitate cholesterol trafficking from PMs to mitochondria for adrenal steroid synthesis and underscore the importance of vesicular trafficking of PM cholesterol for steroidogenesis.—Deng, B., Shen, W.-J., Dong, D., Azhar, S., Kraemer, F.

In this study, we followed the metabolic changes occurring in mice when chronic stress caused by psychosocial defeat (CPD) is associated with ad libitum exposure to a palatable high-fat diet (HFD). In this model, CPD mice consumed more HFD than unstressed (Un) mice without gaining body weight. We focused on metabolic processes involved in weight control, such as de novo lipogenesis (DNL), fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), and thermogenesis. The activity and expression of DNL enzymes were reduced in the liver and white adipose tissue of mice consuming the HFD. Such effects were particularly evident in stressed mice. In both CPD and Un mice, HFD consumption increased the hepatic expression of the mitochondrial FAO enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1. In the liver of mice consuming the HFD, stress exposure prevented accumulation of triacylglycerols; however, accumulation of triacylglycerols was observed in Un mice under the same dietary regimen. In brown adipose tissue, stress increased the expression of uncoupling protein-1, which is involved in energy dissipation, both in HFD and control diet-fed mice. We consider increased FAO and energy dissipation responsible for the antiobesity effect seen in CPD/HFD mice. However, CPD associated with HFD induced hepatic oxidative stress.—Giudetti, A.

However, the relation between these processes during recovery from disuse remains unclear. In this study, we explored the potential interrelationship between the molecular regulation of muscle mass and oxidative metabolism during recovery from disuse. Molecular profiles were measured in biopsies from the vastus lateralis of healthy men after 1-leg cast immobilization and after 1 wk reloading, and in mouse gastrocnemius obtained before and after hindlimb suspension and during reloading (RL-1, -2, -3, -5, and -8 d). Cluster analysis of the human recovery response revealed correlations between myogenesis and autophagy markers in 2 clusters, which were distinguished by the presence of markers of early myogenesis, autophagosome formation, and mitochondrial turnover vs. markers of late myogenesis, autophagy initiation, and mitochondrial mass. In line with these findings, an early transient increase in B-cell lymphoma-2 interacting protein-3 and sequestosome-1 protein, and GABA type A receptor-associated protein like-1 protein and mRNA and a late increase in myomaker and myosin heavy chain-8 mRNA, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II:I ratio, and FUN14 domain-containing-1 mRNA and protein were observed in mice.

To lower the Po of our baseline construct, we expressed these γ mutants with α subunits lacking furin-cleavage sites (αR205A, R231A or αF) and WT β subunits. To determine whether our constructs were locked open in our experiments, we first measured inhibition by an independent effector. We measured Na+ self-inhibition (allosteric ENaC inhibition by extracellular Na+) by rapidly increasing [Na+] in the bath while continuously recording the current at constant voltage. This maneuver rapidly increases the driving force for Na+ entry while simultaneously introducing an ENaC inhibitor to the bath, and results in a peak current that decays over several seconds (Fig. 2A). We assessed Na+ self-inhibition by measuring the magnitude of current decay relative to the peak current after rapidly increasing [Na+] (18.Bize V. Horisberger J.D. Sodium self-inhibition of human epithelial sodium channel: selectivity and affinity of the extracellular sodium sensing site.Am. J. Physiol.

Both constructs exhibited clear Na+ self-inhibition (Fig. 2A), with control channels having 11 ± 5% inhibition (n = 18) and thumb deletion channels having 23 ± 8% inhibition (n = 30; p < 0.0001 versus control by Student's t test). These data place an upper limit on channel Po in buffers containing 110 mm Na+, suggesting neither channel is locked open. We then added γ-11 to determine the effect of removing the thumb domain on inhibition. We found that even 100 μm γ-11 poorly inhibited currents from the γ-thumb domain deletion mutant (29 ± 8%), consistent with an IC50 greater than 100 μm. In contrast, control channel currents were inhibited by 90% at 10 μm γ-11, and the measured IC50 was 1.7 ± 0.9 μm. These data suggest that the γ subunit's thumb domain plays a critical role in ENaC inhibition by γ-11. We postulated that the requirement for the γ subunit thumb domain was specific to inhibition by γ-11. To test specificity, we determined whether deleting the γ subunit thumb domain affected inhibition by α-8. WT ENaC subunits expressed in oocytes are cleaved by furin and do not retain the α subunit's inhibitory tract that competes with α-8 binding (16.Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Furin cleavage activates the epithelial Na+ channel by relieving Na+ self-inhibition.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290 (16449353): F1488-F149610.1152/ajprenal.00439.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We therefore deleted the γ subunit thumb domain in a WT ENaC background. We then determined whether the control or γ thumb domain deletion mutant was locked open by measuring Na+ self-inhibition (Fig. 3A). Extracellular Na+ inhibited αβγ by 17 ± 5% (n = 14) and αβγΔThumb by 8 ± 5% (n = 9, p < 0.01 by Student's t test). These data demonstrate that neither channel is locked open (as Na+ inhibition remains evident), but suggest a higher upper limit for the Po of αβγΔThumb as compared with WT. When we added α-8 to the bath, we found that α-8 inhibited both WT and the γ subunit thumb deletion mutant in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of αβγΔThumb was modestly weaker than WT at 3 μm α-8 (Fig. 3B). This may be in part due to the lower propensity for αβγΔThumb to close (13.Passero C.J. Carattino M.D. Kashlan O.B. Myerburg M.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Defining an inhibitory domain in the γ subunit of the epithelial sodium channel.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2010; 299 (20630937): F854-F86110.1152/ajprenal.00316.2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, α-8 does not require the γ subunit thumb domain to inhibit ENaC, whereas γ-11 clearly does (Fig. 2B). We then tested the ability of chymotrypsin to activate both αβγ and αβγΔThumb channels. Because Xenopus oocytes endogenously express furin, activation of WT ENaC by exogenous proteases occurs though cleavage of the γ subunit distal to the autoinhibitory tract. Based on our hypothesis of γ subunit autoinhibitory tract function, we predicted that channels lacking the γ subunit thumb domain would be poorly activated by proteolytic removal of the γ subunit autoinhibitory tract. Indeed, we found that chymotrypsin robustly activated WT channels, but not channels lacking the γ subunit thumb domain (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the γ subunit thumb domain is required for proteolytic activation resulting from removal of the γ subunit autoinhibitory tract. These data are consistent with the notion that the γ autoinhibitory tract and γ-11 both require the γ thumb domain to affect inhibition. Tryptophan mutagenesis of specific sites in the α subunit's finger domain weakened α-8 inhibition (12.Kashlan O.B. Boyd C.R. Argyropoulos C. Okumura S. Hughey R.P. Grabe M. Kleyman T.R. Allosteric inhibition of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) through peptide binding at peripheral finger and thumb domains.J. Biol.

Several of these sites are conserved in the α and γ subunits (Fig. 1B, open triangles). We tested our hypothesis of γ-11 binding and inhibition by mutating these sites to tryptophan and determining the effect on γ-11 inhibition (Fig. 4). We introduced mutations into an αFβγΔI background as described above for experiments in Fig. 2. Two of the mutants, L212W and A231W, had time-dependent current rundown that was 4–5-fold greater than control channels, confounding measurements of peptide inhibition (data not shown). As a result, we excluded these mutants from our analyses. We first assessed Na+ self-inhibition to determine the effect of mutation on inhibition by an independent effector. Two mutants showed Na+ self-inhibition similar to control, and one, T224W, had minimal Na+ self-inhibition (3 ± 2%, n = 7), suggesting it may be locked open (Fig. 4, A and B). Examining the effect of the γ subunit finger domain mutation on γ-11 inhibition, we found that G209W, T224W, and N242W greatly reduced γ-11 inhibition (Fig. 4, A and C). Because T224W was also poorly inhibited by an independent effector, the reduction in inhibition by γ-11 may not be due to direct interference with the mechanism of γ-11 inhibition. In contrast G209W and N242W had Na+ self-inhibition similar to control channels, suggesting that mutation at these sites in the γ subunit finger domain specifically interfere with inhibition by γ-11. Our data suggest a role for the γ subunit finger and thumb domains for γ-11 binding and inhibition. To determine whether γ-11 binds at the γ subunit finger–thumb interface, we attempted to cross-link the peptide to the channel by using sulfhydryl reactive cross-linkers and cysteines introduced at specific sites in both the peptide and the channel. In experiments with mouse ENaC and cysteine derivatives of mouse γ-11, we found that peptide inhibition was poorly reversible making cross-link detection difficult. When we tested human ENaC with cysteine derivatives of human γ-11, we found that inhibition was largely reversible. Human γ-11 inhibited αβγΔI with an IC50 of 10.1 ± 2.4 μm (n = 7), which is ∼2.9-fold weaker than the analogous mouse combination (13.Passero C.J. Carattino M.D. Kashlan O.B. Myerburg M.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Defining an inhibitory domain in the γ subunit of the epithelial sodium channel.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2010; 299 (20630937): F854-F86110.1152/ajprenal.00316.2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We speculate that the increased reversibility of human γ-11 may be due to its decreased hydrophobicity (mγ-11: RFLNLIPLLVF versus hγ-11: RFSHRIPLLIF). We found that human γ-11 derivatives with cysteine added to the beginning (CRFSHRIPLLIF) or end (RFSHRIPLLIFC) of the sequence, or with cysteine substitution at the third position (RFCHRIPLLIF), inhibited the channel (Fig. 5A). Based on our model of α-8 inhibition through binding the α subunit (14.Kashlan O.B. Adelman J.L. Okumura S. Blobner B.M. Zuzek Z. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Grabe M.

We therefore generated γS220C in a human γΔI background, and expressed hαFβγΔIS220C (S220C) or hαFβγΔI (control) channels in oocytes (Fig. 5). We first perfused oocytes with 10 μm 1,4-butanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate (MTS-4-MTS) for 15 s (Fig. 5A). We and others have reported that longer exposures to bifunctional methanethiosulfonate (MTS) compounds irreversibly inhibit ENaC (21.Kashlan O.B. Blobner B.M. Zuzek Z. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R.

This step labels accessible cysteines on the channel with MTS-4-MTS, potentially leaving an unreacted MTS group tethered to the mutated site. After a wash step to remove MTS-4-MTS from the bath, we added γ-11 cysteine derivatives. If the bound inhibitory peptide presents a cysteine in close proximity to an MTS group tethered to the channel, the bound peptide may react and become tethered to the channel. To detect this possibility, we removed the inhibitory peptide from the bath and measured reversibility of peptide inhibition (Fig. 5A). We reasoned that reduced reversibility with specific combinations of γ subunit mutant and γ-11 derivative suggests cross-linking. We observed reduced reversibility with the γS220C/RFSHRIPLLIFC combination as compared with control channels with the same γ-11 derivative, or with the same mutant but a different γ-11 derivative (RFCHRIPLLIF), or with the same mutant and peptide but omitting MTS-4-MTS (Fig. 5, A and B). These data suggest that the C terminus of γ-11 cross-links to the γ subunit finger domain. We also predicted that the N terminus of bound γ-11 lies at the finger–thumb domain interface. To test our hypothesis, we generated γQ426C in a human γΔI background, and expressed hαFβγΔIQ426C (Q426C) or hαFβγΔI (control) channels in oocytes (Fig. 5, C and D). In agreement with our hypothesis, we observed reduced reversibility of peptide inhibition with the γQ426C/CRFSHRIPLLIF combination than we did with control channels and the same γ-11 derivative, or with γQ426C and a different γ-11 derivative (RFCHRIPLLIF), or with γQ426C/CRFSHRIPLLIF but omitting MTS-4-MTS. These data are consistent with a model of γ-11 inhibition where γ-11 inhibits the channel by binding the γ subunit finger–thumb interface. The ENaC α and γ subunits share no sequence homology in the region that includes the cleavage sites and autoinhibitory tracts (Fig. 1B). Despite this, our data suggest that the inhibitory mechanisms of peptides derived from these autoinhibitory tracts (α-8 and γ-11) are analogous. Each peptide inhibits the channel by binding to the finger–thumb domain interface of the subunit from which it is derived, and each peptide acts allosterically (Fig. 6). Our previous work suggested distinct binding sites for each peptide. We showed that the α subunit autoinhibitory tract and α-8 likely have overlapping binding sites (14.Kashlan O.B. Adelman J.L. Okumura S. Blobner B.M. Zuzek Z. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Grabe M. Constraint-based, homology model of the extracellular domain of the epithelial Na+ channel a subunit reveals a mechanism of channel activation by proteases.J. Biol.

We also showed that the γ subunit autoinhibitory tract competes with γ-11 inhibition (13.Passero C.J. Carattino M.D. Kashlan O.B. Myerburg M.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Defining an inhibitory domain in the γ subunit of the epithelial sodium channel.Am. J. Physiol.

Accordingly, here we have shown that the γ subunit thumb domain is essential for γ-11 inhibition (Fig. 2), but not for α-8 inhibition (Fig. 3). Yet our data also suggest analogous binding sites for α-8 and γ-11. We previously showed that mutations at specific sites in the finger domain of the α subunit diminished the efficacy of α-8 inhibition (12.Kashlan O.B. Boyd C.R. Argyropoulos C. Okumura S. Hughey R.P. Grabe M. Kleyman T.R. Allosteric inhibition of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) through peptide binding at peripheral finger and thumb domains.J. Biol.

Mutations at two of the equivalent sites in the γ subunit reduced inhibition by γ-11 (Fig. 4). We have also shown that each peptide can be cross-linked at their N terminus to the respective thumb domain, and at their C terminus to the respective finger domain (Fig. 5) (21.Kashlan O.B. Blobner B.M. Zuzek Z. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. Inhibitory tract traps the epithelial Na+ channel in a low activity conformation.J. Biol.

An allosteric mechanism for peptide inhibition is supported by several observations. Despite being positively charged, inhibition by an α subunit-derived peptide was not voltage dependent and did not compete with amiloride, a bona fide pore blocker (3.Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Pilewski J.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. The epithelial Na+ channel is inhibited by a peptide derived from proteolytic processing of its a subunit.J. Biol.

This likely rules out a pore-blocking mechanism analogous to amiloride. The sites we have identified for α-8 and γ-11 are far from the putative channel gate in the transmembrane helices (see Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we have shown that the finger–thumb domain interfaces of both the α and γ subunits can be manipulated independently of peptide addition to modulate channel function (21.Kashlan O.B.

https://openalex.org/W2888288451,"The neuropeptide relaxin-3 and its receptor relaxin family peptide receptor-3 (RXFP3) play key roles in modulating behavior such as memory and learning, food intake, and reward seeking. A linear relaxin-3 antagonist (R3 B1-22R) based on a modified and truncated relaxin-3 B-chain was recently developed. R3 B1-22R is unstructured in solution; thus, the binding conformation and determinants of receptor binding are unclear. Here, we have designed, chemically synthesized, and pharmacologically characterized more than 60 analogues of R3 B1-22R to develop an extensive understanding of its structure-activity relationships. We show that the key driver for affinity is the nonnative C-terminal Arg23 Additional contributors to binding include amino acid residues that are important also for relaxin-3 binding, including Arg12, Ile15, and Ile19 Intriguingly, amino acid residues that are not exposed in native relaxin-3, including Phe14 and Ala17, also interact with RXFP3. We show that R3 B1-22R has a propensity to form a helical structure, and modifications that support a helical conformation are functionally well-tolerated, whereas helix breakers such as proline residues disrupt binding. These data suggest that the peptide adopts a helical conformation, like relaxin-3, upon binding to RXFP3, but that its smaller size allows it to penetrate deeper into the orthosteric binding site, creating more extensive contacts with the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2611819586,"Introduction Somatic complications account for the majority of the 13–30 years shortened life expectancy in psychiatric patients compared to the general population. The study aim was to assess to which extent patients visiting outpatient departments for mood and anxiety disorders were monitored for relevant somatic comorbidities and (adverse) effects of psychotropic drugs–more specifically a) metabolic parameters, b) lithium safety and c) ECGs—during their treatment. Methods We performed a retrospective clinical records review and cross-sectional analysis to assess the extent of somatic monitoring at four outpatient departments for mood and anxiety disorders in The Netherlands. We consecutively recruited adult patients visiting a participating outpatient department between March and November 2014. The primary outcome was percentage of patients without monitoring measurements. Secondary outcomes were number of measurements per parameter per patient per year and time from start of treatment to first measurement. Results We included 324 outpatients, of whom 60.2% were female. Most patients were treated for depressive disorders (39.8%), anxiety disorders (16.7%) or bipolar or related disorders (11.7%) and 198 patients (61.1%) used at least one psychotropic drug. For 186 patients (57.4%), no monitoring records were recorded (median treatment period 7.3 months, range 0–55.6). The median number of measurements per parameter per year since the start of outpatient treatment for patients with monitoring measurements was 0.31 (range 0.0–12.9). The median time to first monitoring measurement per parameter for patients with monitoring measurements was 3.8 months (range 0.0–50.7). Discussion Somatic monitoring in outpatients with mood and anxiety disorders is not routine clinical practice. Monitoring practices need to be improved to prevent psychiatric outpatients from undetected somatic complications."

The goal of this study is to provide a real-time, efficient, and highly automated nutritional diagnosis system for producers by analyzing images obtained in forests. Using images acquired from field servers, which were installed in six forest farms of different cities located in northern Hainan Province, we propose a new segmentation algorithm and define a new indicator named ""growth status"" (GS), which includes two varieties: GSMER (the ratio of sandalwood pixels to the minimum enclosing rectangle pixels) and GSMCC (the ratio of sandalwood pixels to minimum circumscribed circle pixels). We used the error-in-variable model by considering the errors that exist in independent variables. After comparison and analysis, the obtained results show that (1) The b and L channels in the Lab color system have complementary advantages. By combining this system with the Otsu method, median filtering and a morphological operation, sandalwood can be separated from the background. (2) The fitting degree of the models improves after adding the GS indicator and shows that GSMCC performs better than GSMER. (3) After using the error-in-variable model to estimate the parameters, the accuracy and precision of the model improved compared to the results obtained using the least squares method. The optimal model for predicting the total nitrogen content is [Formula: see text]. This study demonstrates the use of Internet of Things technology in forestry and provides guidance for the nutritional diagnosis of the important sandalwood tree species."
https://openalex.org/W2888430314,"Levan has various potential applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries, such as cholesterol-lowering agents and prebiotics, due to its beneficial properties, which depend on its length and branching degree. A previous study also found that the branching degree of levan affected anti-tumor activities against SNU-1 and HepG2 tumor cell lines. Despite its promising potential, the properties of levans with different branching degrees are not well understood at the molecular level. In two models of the generalized Born implicit solvent (GBHCT and GBOBC1), we employed replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations to explore conformational spaces of 34-residue levans (L34) with branching degrees of zero (LFO34B0), one (LFO34B1), three (LFO34B3) and five (LFO34B5), as well as to elucidate their structural and molecular properties. To ensure a fair comparison of the effects of branching degree on these properties, we focused on analyzing the properties of the central 21-residue of the main chains of all systems. Our results show that all major representative conformations tend to form helix-like structures with kinks, where two-kink helix-like structures have the highest population. As branching degree increases, the population of helix-like structures with zero or one kink tends to increase slightly. As the number of kinks in the structures with the same branching degree increases, the average values of the lengths and angles among centers of masses of three consecutive turns of residue i, i+3, and i+6 tended to decrease. Due to its highest occurring frequencies, the O6 (i)—H3O (i+1) hydrogen bond could be important for helix-like structure formation. Moreover, hydrogen bonds forming among the branching residue (br), branching position (bp) and other residues of L34B1, L34B3 and L34B5 were identified. The O1(bp)—H3O(br), O1(br)—H3O(br) and O5(br)—H1O(br) hydrogen bonds were found in the first-, second- and third-highest occurrence frequencies, respectively. Our study provides novel and important insights into conformational spaces and the structural and molecular properties of 34-residue levans with various branching degrees, which tend to form helix-like structures with kinks."
https://openalex.org/W2888564850,"Central sensitization plays a pivotal role in maintenance of pain and is believed to be intricately involved in several chronic pain conditions. One clinical manifestation of central sensitization is secondary hyperalgesia. The degree of secondary hyperalgesia presumably reflects individual levels of central sensitization. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between areas of secondary hyperalgesia and volumes of the caudate nuclei and other brain structures involved in pain processing.We recruited 121 healthy male participants; 118 were included in the final analysis. All participants underwent whole brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Prior to MRI, all participants underwent pain testing. Secondary hyperalgesia was induced by brief thermal sensitization. Additionally, we recorded heat pain detection thresholds (HPDT), pain during one minute thermal stimulation (p-TS) and results of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression score (HADS).We found no significant associations between the size of the area of secondary hyperalgesia and the volume of the caudate nuclei or of the following structures: primary somatosensory cortex, anterior and mid cingulate cortex, putamen, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, insula and the cerebellum. Likewise, we found no significant associations between the volume of the caudate nuclei and HPDTs, p-TS, PCS and HADS.Our findings indicate that the size of the secondary hyperalgesia area is not associated with the volume of brain structures relevant for pain processing, suggesting that the propensity to develop central sensitization, assessed as secondary hyperalgesia, is not correlated to brain structure volume."

We evaluated cerebral microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging in adult patients with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF). Ten ToF patients (6 women, 4 men; aged 21-58 years; New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 1-2) were prospectively enrolled and underwent a T1-weighted, a T2-weighted dark fluid, and a T2*-weighted scans. Ten age- and sex-matched controls were prospectively recruited and subjected to the same acquisition protocol. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) were manually counted while white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) were segmented using ITK-Snap. Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Spearman correlation, and Bland-Altman statistics were used. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 45.0 (30.5-49.5) years in ToF patients and 46.0 (30.5-49.8) years in controls. The median (IQR) of the number of CMBs was 6.0 (4.0-7.8) in ToF patients and 0 (0.0-0.0) in controls (p = 0.002). The WMHs burden was 2,506 (1,557-2,900) mm3 for ToF patients and 2,212 (1,860-2,586) mm3 for controls (p = 0.160). Moreover, a positive significant correlation was found between the WMHs burden and the NYHA class (ρ = 0.80, p = 0.005). Inter-operator concordance rate for the presence/absence of CMBs was 90%; the reproducibility for the WMHs burden was 77%. In conclusion, we found more cerebral microbleeds and a higher WMHs burden in adult ToF patients than in controls. This preliminary comparison supports the hypothesis of an early brain aging in ToF patients. Larger studies are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2888536235,"Acquisition of the trace element copper (Cu) is critical to drive essential eukaryotic processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, iron mobilization, peptide hormone biogenesis, and connective tissue maturation. The Ctr1/Ctr3 family of Cu importers, first discovered in fungi and conserved in mammals, are critical for Cu+ movement across the plasma membrane or mobilization from endosomal compartments. Whereas ablation of Ctr1 in mammals is embryonic lethal, and Ctr1 is critical for dietary Cu absorption, cardiac function, and systemic iron distribution, little is known about the intrinsic contribution of Ctr1 for Cu+ permeation through membranes or its mechanism of action. Here, we identify three members of a Cu+ importer family from the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum: Ctr3a and Ctr3b, which function on the plasma membrane, and Ctr2, which likely functions in endosomal Cu mobilization. All three proteins drive Cu and isoelectronic silver (Ag) uptake in cells devoid of Cu+ importers. Transport activity depends on signature amino acid motifs that are conserved and essential for all Ctr1/3 transporters. Ctr3a is stable and amenable to purification and was incorporated into liposomes to reconstitute an in vitro Ag+ transport assay characterized by stopped-flow spectroscopy. Ctr3a has intrinsic high-affinity metal ion transport activity that closely reflects values determined in vivo, with slow turnover kinetics. Given structural models for mammalian Ctr1, Ctr3a likely functions as a low-efficiency Cu+ ion channel. The Ctr1/Ctr3 family may be tuned to import essential yet potentially toxic Cu+ ions at a slow rate to meet cellular needs, while minimizing labile intracellular Cu+ pools. Acquisition of the trace element copper (Cu) is critical to drive essential eukaryotic processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, iron mobilization, peptide hormone biogenesis, and connective tissue maturation. The Ctr1/Ctr3 family of Cu importers, first discovered in fungi and conserved in mammals, are critical for Cu+ movement across the plasma membrane or mobilization from endosomal compartments. Whereas ablation of Ctr1 in mammals is embryonic lethal, and Ctr1 is critical for dietary Cu absorption, cardiac function, and systemic iron distribution, little is known about the intrinsic contribution of Ctr1 for Cu+ permeation through membranes or its mechanism of action. Here, we identify three members of a Cu+ importer family from the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum: Ctr3a and Ctr3b, which function on the plasma membrane, and Ctr2, which likely functions in endosomal Cu mobilization.
