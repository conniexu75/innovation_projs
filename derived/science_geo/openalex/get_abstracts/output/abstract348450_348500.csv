https://openalex.org/W2115483901,"Background Worldwide, grapes and their derived products have a large market. The cultivated grape species Vitis vinifera has potential to become a model for fruit trees genetics. Like many plant species, it is highly heterozygous, which is an additional challenge to modern whole genome shotgun sequencing. In this paper a high quality draft genome sequence of a cultivated clone of V. vinifera Pinot Noir is presented. Principal Findings We estimate the genome size of V. vinifera to be 504.6 Mb. Genomic sequences corresponding to 477.1 Mb were assembled in 2,093 metacontigs and 435.1 Mb were anchored to the 19 linkage groups (LGs). The number of predicted genes is 29,585, of which 96.1% were assigned to LGs. This assembly of the grape genome provides candidate genes implicated in traits relevant to grapevine cultivation, such as those influencing wine quality, via secondary metabolites, and those connected with the extreme susceptibility of grape to pathogens. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distribution was consistent with a diffuse haplotype structure across the genome. Of around 2,000,000 SNPs, 1,751,176 were mapped to chromosomes and one or more of them were identified in 86.7% of anchored genes. The relative age of grape duplicated genes was estimated and this made possible to reveal a relatively recent Vitis-specific large scale duplication event concerning at least 10 chromosomes (duplication not reported before). Conclusions Sanger shotgun sequencing and highly efficient sequencing by synthesis (SBS), together with dedicated assembly programs, resolved a complex heterozygous genome. A consensus sequence of the genome and a set of mapped marker loci were generated. Homologous chromosomes of Pinot Noir differ by 11.2% of their DNA (hemizygous DNA plus chromosomal gaps). SNP markers are offered as a tool with the potential of introducing a new era in the molecular breeding of grape."
https://openalex.org/W2023448665,"In a randomized controlled trial, we compared abandoned children reared in institutions to abandoned children placed in institutions but then moved to foster care. Young children living in institutions were randomly assigned to continued institutional care or to placement in foster care, and their cognitive development was tracked through 54 months of age. The cognitive outcome of children who remained in the institution was markedly below that of never-institutionalized children and children taken out of the institution and placed into foster care. The improved cognitive outcomes we observed at 42 and 54 months were most marked for the youngest children placed in foster care. These results point to the negative sequelae of early institutionalization, suggest a possible sensitive period in cognitive development, and underscore the advantages of family placements for young abandoned children."
https://openalex.org/W2158096004,"Beetles represent almost one-fourth of all described species, and knowledge about their relationships and evolution adds to our understanding of biodiversity. We performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Coleoptera inferred from three genes and nearly 1900 species, representing more than 80% of the world's recognized beetle families. We defined basal relationships in the Polyphaga supergroup, which contains over 300,000 species, and established five families as the earliest branching lineages. By dating the phylogeny, we found that the success of beetles is explained neither by exceptional net diversification rates nor by a predominant role of herbivory and the Cretaceous rise of angiosperms. Instead, the pre-Cretaceous origin of more than 100 present-day lineages suggests that beetle species richness is due to high survival of lineages and sustained diversification in a variety of niches."

We show that amyloid fibrils, ordered supramolecular nanostructures that are self-assembled from a wide range of polypeptide molecules, have rigidities varying over four orders of magnitude, and constitute a class of high-performance biomaterials. We elucidate the molecular origin of fibril material properties and show that the major contribution to their rigidity stems from a generic interbackbone hydrogen-bonding network that is modulated by variable side-chain interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2049883489,"Quantum mechanical superexchange interactions form the basis of quantum magnetism in strongly correlated electronic media. We report on the direct measurement of superexchange interactions with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. After preparing a spin-mixture of ultracold atoms in an antiferromagnetically ordered state, we measured coherent superexchange-mediated spin dynamics with coupling energies from 5 hertz up to 1 kilohertz. By dynamically modifying the potential bias between neighboring lattice sites, the magnitude and sign of the superexchange interaction can be controlled, thus allowing the system to be switched between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spin interactions. We compare our findings to predictions of a two-site Bose-Hubbard model and find very good agreement, but are also able to identify corrections that can be explained by the inclusion of direct nearest-neighbor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2118069376,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission underlies aspects of learning and memory. LTP is input-specific at the level of individual synapses, but neural network models predict interactions between plasticity at nearby synapses. Here we show in mouse hippocampal pyramidal cells that LTP at individual synapses reduces the threshold for potentiation at neighbouring synapses. After input-specific LTP induction by two-photon glutamate uncaging or by synaptic stimulation, subthreshold stimuli, which by themselves were too weak to trigger LTP, caused robust LTP and spine enlargement at neighbouring spines. Furthermore, LTP induction broadened the presynaptic-postsynaptic spike interval for spike-timing-dependent LTP within a dendritic neighbourhood. The reduction in the threshold for LTP induction lasted approximately 10 min and spread over approximately 10 microm of dendrite. These local interactions between neighbouring synapses support clustered plasticity models of memory storage and could allow for the binding of behaviourally linked information on the same dendritic branch."
https://openalex.org/W1963937305,"Electrical microstimulation can establish causal links between the activity of groups of neurons and perceptual and cognitive functions1,2,3,4,5,6. However, the number and identities of neurons microstimulated, as well as the number of action potentials evoked, are difficult to ascertain7,8. To address these issues we introduced the light-gated algal channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)9 specifically into a small fraction of layer 2/3 neurons of the mouse primary somatosensory cortex. ChR2 photostimulation in vivo reliably generated stimulus-locked action potentials10,11,12,13 at frequencies up to 50 Hz. Here we show that naive mice readily learned to detect brief trains of action potentials (five light pulses, 1 ms, 20 Hz). After training, mice could detect a photostimulus firing a single action potential in approximately 300 neurons. Even fewer neurons (approximately 60) were required for longer stimuli (five action potentials, 250 ms). Our results show that perceptual decisions and learning can be driven by extremely brief epochs of cortical activity in a sparse subset of supragranular cortical pyramidal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2057191118,"Structural rearrangements are an essential property of atomic and molecular glasses; they are critical in controlling resistance to flow and are central to the evolution of many properties of glasses, such as their heat capacity and dielectric constant. Despite their importance, these rearrangements cannot directly be visualized in atomic glasses. We used a colloidal glass to obtain direct three-dimensional images of thermally induced structural rearrangements in the presence of an applied shear. We identified localized irreversible shear transformation zones and determined their formation energy and topology. A transformation favored successive ones in its vicinity. Using continuum models, we elucidated the interplay between applied strain and thermal fluctuations that governs the formation of these zones in both colloidal and molecular glasses."

https://openalex.org/W1970304959,"DNA replication in eukaryotes requires nucleosome disruption ahead of the replication fork and reassembly behind. An unresolved issue concerns how histone dynamics are coordinated with fork progression to maintain chromosomal stability. Here, we characterize a complex in which the human histone chaperone Asf1 and MCM2–7, the putative replicative helicase, are connected through a histone H3-H4 bridge. Depletion of Asf1 by RNA interference impedes DNA unwinding at replication sites, and similar defects arise from overproduction of new histone H3-H4 that compromises Asf1 function. These data link Asf1 chaperone function, histone supply, and replicative unwinding of DNA in chromatin. We propose that Asf1, as a histone acceptor and donor, handles parental and new histones at the replication fork via an Asf1–(H3-H4)–MCM2–7 intermediate and thus provides a means to fine-tune replication fork progression and histone supply and demand."

https://openalex.org/W2021524596,"The supposed low viscosity of serpentine may strongly influence subduction-zone dynamics at all time scales, but until now its role could not be quantified because measurements relevant to intermediate-depth settings were lacking. Deformation experiments on the serpentine antigorite at high pressures and temperatures (1 to 4 gigapascals, 200° to 500°C) showed that the viscosity of serpentine is much lower than that of the major mantle-forming minerals. Regardless of the temperature, low-viscosity serpentinized mantle at the slab surface can localize deformation, impede stress buildup, and limit the downdip propagation of large earthquakes at subduction zones. Antigorite enables viscous relaxation with characteristic times comparable to those of long-term postseismic deformations after large earthquakes and slow earthquakes. Antigorite viscosity is sufficiently low to make serpentinized faults in the oceanic lithosphere a site for subduction initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2059659335,"Background Glucosinolates are natural metabolites in the order Brassicales that defend plants against both herbivores and pathogens and can attract specialized insects. Knowledge about the genes controlling glucosinolate regulation is limited. Here, we identify three R2R3 MYB transcription factors regulating aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis by combining several systems biology tools. Methodology/Principal Findings MYB28 was identified as a candidate regulator of aliphatic glucosinolates based on its co-localization within a genomic region controlling variation both in aliphatic glucosinolate content (metabolite QTL) and in transcript level for genes involved in the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates (expression QTL), as well as its co-expression with genes in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis. A phylogenetic analysis with the R2R3 motif of MYB28 showed that it and two homologues, MYB29 and MYB76, were members of an Arabidopsis-specific clade that included three characterized regulators of indole glucosinolates. Over-expression of the individual MYB genes showed that they all had the capacity to increase the production of aliphatic glucosinolates in leaves and seeds and induce gene expression of aliphatic biosynthetic genes within leaves. Analysis of leaves and seeds of single knockout mutants showed that mutants of MYB29 and MYB76 have reductions in only short-chained aliphatic glucosinolates whereas a mutant in MYB28 has reductions in both short- and long-chained aliphatic glucosinolates. Furthermore, analysis of a double knockout in MYB28 and MYB29 identified an emergent property of the system since the absence of aliphatic glucosinolates in these plants could not be predicted by the chemotype of the single knockouts. Conclusions/Significance It seems that these cruciferous-specific MYB regulatory genes have evolved both overlapping and specific regulatory capacities. This provides a unique system within which to study the evolution of MYB regulatory factors and their downstream targets."

We report on the creation of a current-driven blue-violet photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser. We have developed a fabrication method, named “air holes retained over growth,” in order to construct a two-dimensional gallium nitride (GaN)/air photonic-crystal structure. The resulting periodic structure has a photonic-crystal band-edge effect sufficient for the successful operation of a current-injection surface-emitting laser. This represents an important step in the development of laser sources that could be focused to a size much less than the wavelength and be integrated two-dimensionally at such short wavelengths."

We determined the crystal structure of the Gα q -p63RhoGEF-RhoA complex, detailing the interactions of Gα q with the Dbl and pleckstrin homology (DH and PH) domains of p63RhoGEF. These interactions involve the effector-binding site and the C-terminal region of Gα q and appear to relieve autoinhibition of the catalytic DH domain by the PH domain. Trio, Duet, and p63RhoGEF are shown to constitute a family of Gα q effectors that appear to activate RhoA both in vitro and in intact cells. We propose that this structure represents the crux of an ancient signal transduction pathway that is expected to be important in an array of physiological processes."

The transglycosylation activity of Endo-M holds a great promise for the chemo-enzymatic synthesis and glyco-engineering of glycoproteins, but the inherent hydrolytic activity for product hydrolysis and low transglycosylation have hampered its broad applications. This paper describes the site-directed mutagenesis on residues in the putative catalytic region of Endo-M to generate mutants with superior transglycosylation activity. Two interesting mutants were discovered. The Y217F mutant was found to possess much enhanced transglycosylation activity and yet much diminished hydrolytic activity in comparison with the wild-type Endo-M. Kinetic analyses revealed that the Km value of Y217F for an acceptor substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-l-N-acetylglucosaminide was only one-tenth of that of the wild-type, implicating a much higher affinity of Y217F for the acceptor substrate than the wild-type. The other mutant, N175A, acts like a glycosynthase. It was found that mutation at Asn175“knocked out” the hydrolytic activity, but the mutant was able to take the highly active sugar oxazolines (the transition state mimics) as donor substrates for transglycosylation. This is the first glycosynthase derived from endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases that proceed via a substrate-assisted mechanism.

The other ENGases are distinct from the enzymes of the GH18 chitinase family and are classified into the GH family 85. We and others have previously reported that several ENGases of the GH85 family showed significant transglycosylation activity (i.e. the ability to transfer the releasing glycan to an acceptor other than water to form a new glycosidic linkage) (3Yamamoto K.

Whereas Endo-A, Endo-CE, and Endo-BH are mainly specific for high mannose type N-glycans, the Endo-M is unique in that it can act on all three types of N-glycans (high mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type) for hydrolysis and transglycosylation. The transglycosylation activity of the ENGases, specifically Endo-M and Endo-A, has found useful applications for the synthesis of novel oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates (7Yamamoto K. Takegawa K.

The chemo-enzymatic method provides a highly convergent synthesis of glycopeptides, since the ENGases are able to attach a large oligosaccharide moiety to a preformed GlcNAc-peptide in a single step and in a regio- and stereo-selective manner without the need of protecting groups. Nevertheless, since ENGases are inherently glycohydrolases, a broader application of the endoglycosidases for synthetic purpose has been hampered by their relatively low transglycosylation activity and by the issue of product hydrolysis. Although the incorporation of organic solvents in the reaction medium can enhance the transglycosylation yield to some extent (15Akaike E. Tsutsumida M. Osumi K. Fujita M. Yamanoi T. Yamamoto K. Fujita K. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the overall efficiency is generally low. In addition, the limitation to the use of only natural N-glycans or N-glycopeptides as the donor substrates further constrains the usefulness of the approach. As an effort to address these problems, we and others have recently explored synthetic sugar oxazolines, a highly active species mimicking the presumed transition state, as donor substrates for the enzymatic transglycosylation (16Fujita M.

It was found that this strategy was particularly useful for the synthesis of glycopeptides carrying truncated and/or modified N-glycans, since the highly activated sugar oxazolines could tolerate certain modifications, but the resulting (ground state) glycopeptide product would become resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis due to the slight modification, allowing accumulation of the product (17Li B.

However, when glycopeptides and glycoproteins carrying natural, full-size N-glycans are concerned, the rapid hydrolysis of the product by the wild-type endoglycosidases is difficult to avoid, thus limiting its wide application. An ultimate solution to this problem is perhaps to develop unique ENGase-based glycosynthases that lack hydrolysis activity to the product but are able to take highly activated species as donor substrate (23Perugino G.

NdeI and XhoI sites (underlined) were added to the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI and subcloned into pET23b(+) vector (Novagen) to fuse a His6 tag at the C terminus.

Fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader (Power Scan HT, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, Japan) (excitation, 355 nm; emission, 460 nm). One unit of the enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme yielding 1 μmol of 4MU/min. The transglycosylation reaction toward GlcNAc was carried out as follows. 1 mm SGP, 50 mm GlcNAc, and 0.8 μg of the wild-type Endo-M or 1.4 μg of the Y217F mutant was incubated in 25 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0, 80 μl) at 30 °C.

Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Residues in the Putative Catalytic Region of Endo-M–Although the crystal structures of Endo-H, Endo-F1, and Endo-F3 of the GH18 ENGases, which do not possess transglycosylation activity, have been solved (30Rao V.

Nevertheless, based on its sequence similarity to the GH18 enzymes, we have previously performed mutational studies on Endo-A to identify critical residues for the enzymatic activity. For example, the highly conserved Trp216 of Endo-A was found to be essential for its transglycosylation activity but not for its hydrolysis activity (33Fujita K. Takegawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified Glu173 of Endo-A as the putative proton donor by a chemical rescue experiment (34Fujita K. Sato R. Toma K. Kitahara K. Suganuma T. Yamamoto K. Takegawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 142: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The residue is conserved in all of the other members of GH85 and corresponds with Glu177 in Endo-M, as shown by the comparison of the amino acid sequences of ENGases belonging to GH85 (Fig. 1). Based on this analysis with Endo-A, we assume that the corresponding residues in Endo-M and the surrounding region might also be essential for the enzymatic activity of Endo-M. In order to enhance the transglycosylation activity of Endo-M, we attempted to carry out site-directed mutagenesis of various residues in this putative catalytic region that were conserved for the known ENGases of GH family 85 with transglycosylation activity. More recently, a preliminary x-ray crystallographic study on Endo-A was performed by Dr. van Roey and co-workers. 4P. van Roey, personal communication. According to the prelimin"
https://openalex.org/W2068107037,"Wnt signaling is essential for neuronal development and the maintenance of the developing nervous system. Recent studies indicated that Wnt signaling modulates long term potentiation in adult hippocampal slices. We report here that different Wnt ligands are present in hippocampal neurons of rat embryo and adult rat, including Wnt-4, -5a, -7a, and -11. Wnt-7a acts as a canonical Wnt ligand in rat hippocampal neurons, stimulates clustering of presynaptic proteins, and induces recycling and exocytosis of synaptic vesicles as studied by FM dyes. Wnt-3a has a moderate effect on recycling of synaptic vesicles, and no effect of Wnt-1 and Wnt-5a was detected. Electrophysiological analysis on adult rat hippocampal slices indicates that Wnt-7a, but not Wnt-5a, increases neurotransmitter release in CA3-CA1 synapses by decreasing paired pulse facilitation and increasing the miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents frequency. These results indicate that the presynaptic function of rat hippocampal neurons is modulated by the canonical Wnt signaling."

Despite the implication that massive carbonate deposits should have formed, these have not been detected. On the basis of fundamental chemical and physical principles, we propose that climatic conditions enabling the existence of liquid water were maintained by appreciable atmospheric concentrations of volcanically degassed SO 2 and H 2 S. The geochemistry resulting from equilibration of this atmosphere with the hydrological cycle is shown to inhibit the formation of carbonates. We propose an early martian climate feedback involving SO 2 , much like that maintained by CO 2 on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2065748300,"Transposable elements and their remnants constitute a substantial fraction of eukaryotic genomes. Host genomes have evolved defence mechanisms, including chromatin modifications and RNA interference, to regulate transposable elements. Here we describe a genome surveillance mechanism for retrotransposons by transposase-derived centromeric protein CENP-B homologues of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. CENP-B homologues of S. pombe localize at and recruit histone deacetylases to silence Tf2 retrotransposons. CENP-Bs also repress solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) and LTR-associated genes. Tf2 elements are clustered into 'Tf' bodies, the organization of which depends on CENP-Bs that display discrete nuclear structures. Furthermore, CENP-Bs prevent an 'extinct' Tf1 retrotransposon from re-entering the host genome by blocking its recombination with extant Tf2, and silence and immobilize a Tf1 integrant that becomes sequestered into Tf bodies. Our results reveal a probable ancient retrotransposon surveillance pathway important for host genome integrity, and highlight potential conflicts between DNA transposons and retrotransposons, major transposable elements believed to have greatly moulded the evolution of genomes."

https://openalex.org/W2054665225,"Background Mycolic acids are a complex mixture of branched, long-chain fatty acids, representing key components of the highly hydrophobic mycobacterial cell wall. Pathogenic mycobacteria carry mycolic acid sub-types that contain cyclopropane rings. Double bonds at specific sites on mycolic acid precursors are modified by the action of cyclopropane mycolic acid synthases (CMASs). The latter belong to a family of S-adenosyl-methionine-dependent methyl transferases, of which several have been well studied in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, namely, MmaA1 through A4, PcaA and CmaA2. Cyclopropanated mycolic acids are key factors participating in cell envelope permeability, host immunomodulation and persistence of M. tuberculosis. While several antitubercular agents inhibit mycolic acid synthesis, to date, the CMASs have not been shown to be drug targets. Methodology/Principle Findings We have employed various complementary approaches to show that the antitubercular drug, thiacetazone (TAC), and its chemical analogues, inhibit mycolic acid cyclopropanation. Dramatic changes in the content and ratio of mycolic acids in the vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis BCG, as well as in the related pathogenic species Mycobacterium marinum were observed after treatment with the drugs. Combination of thin layer chromatography, mass spectrometry and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analyses of mycolic acids purified from drug-treated mycobacteria showed a significant loss of cyclopropanation in both the α- and oxygenated mycolate sub-types. Additionally, High-Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) NMR analyses on whole cells was used to detect cell wall-associated mycolates and to quantify the cyclopropanation status of the cell envelope. Further, overexpression of cmaA2, mmaA2 or pcaA in mycobacteria partially reversed the effects of TAC and its analogue on mycolic acid cyclopropanation, suggesting that the drugs act directly on CMASs. Conclusions/Significance This is a first report on the mechanism of action of TAC, demonstrating the CMASs as its cellular targets in mycobacteria. The implications of this study may be important for the design of alternative strategies for tuberculosis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2094783617,"Recently published research indicates that soluble oligomers of beta-amyloid (Abeta) may be the key neurotoxic species associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that the process of Abeta aggregation may drive this event. Furthermore, soluble oligomers of Abeta and tau accumulate in the lipid rafts of brains from AD patients through an as yet unknown mechanism. Using cell culture models we report a novel action of Abeta on neuronal plasma membranes where exogenously applied Abeta in the form of ADDLs can be trafficked on the neuronal membrane and accumulate in lipid rafts. ADDL-induced dynamic alterations in lipid raft protein composition were found to facilitate this movement. We show clear associations between Abeta accumulation and redistribution on the neuronal membrane and alterations in the protein composition of lipid rafts. In addition, our data from fyn(-/-) transgenic mice show that accumulation of Abeta on the neuronal surface was not sufficient to cause cell death but that fyn is required for both the redistribution of Abeta and subsequent cell death. These results identify fyn-dependent Abeta redistribution and accumulation in lipid rafts as being key to ADDL-induced cell death and defines a mechanism by which oligomers of Abeta and tau accumulate in lipid rafts."
https://openalex.org/W1995313965,"In adults, angiogenic abnormalities are involved in not only tumor growth but several human inherited diseases as well. It is unclear, however, concerning how the normal vascular structure is maintained and how angiogenesis is initiated in normal adults. Using the Cre-LoxP-mediated conditional gene deletion, we show in the present study that in adult mice disruption of the transcription factor recombination signal-binding protein Jkappa (RBP-J) in endothelial cells strikingly induced spontaneous angiogenesis in multiple tissues, including retina and cornea, as well as in internal organs, such as liver and lung. In a choroidal neovascularization model, which mimics the angiogenic process in tumor growth and age-related macular degeneration, RBP-J deficiency induced a more intensive angiogenic response to injury. This could be transmitted by bone marrow, indicating that RBP-J could modulate bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells in adult angiogenesis. In addition, in the absence of RBP-J, proliferation of endothelial cells increased significantly, leading to accumulative vessel outgrowth. These findings suggest that in adults RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling may play an essential role in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis by repressing endothelial cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2081225557,"Dysferlin and Caveolin-3 are plasma membrane proteins associated with muscular dystrophy. Patients with mutations in the CAV3 gene show dysferlin mislocalization in muscle cells. By utilizing caveolin-null cells, expression of caveolin mutants, and different mutants of dysferlin, we have dissected the site of action of caveolin with respect to dysferlin trafficking pathways. We now show that Caveolin-1 or -3 can facilitate exit of a dysferlin mutant that accumulates in the Golgi complex of Cav1(-/-) cells. In contrast, wild type dysferlin reaches the plasma membrane but is rapidly endocytosed in Cav1(-/-) cells. We demonstrate that the primary effect of caveolin is to cause surface retention of dysferlin. Caveolin-1 or Caveolin-3, but not specific caveolin mutants, inhibit endocytosis of dysferlin through a clathrin-independent pathway colocalizing with internalized glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. Our results provide new insights into the role of this endocytic pathway in surface remodeling of specific surface components. In addition, they highlight a novel mechanism of action of caveolins relevant to the pathogenic mechanisms underlying caveolin-associated disease."
https://openalex.org/W1991191643,"Mtr4p belongs to the Ski2p family of DEVH-box containing proteins and is required for processing and degradation of a variety of RNA substrates in the nucleus. In particular, Mtr4p is required for creating the 5.8 S ribosomal RNA from its 7 S precursor, proper 3′-end processing of the U4 small nuclear RNA and some small nucleolar RNAs, and degradation of aberrant mRNAs and tRNAs. In these studies we have shown that Mtr4p has RNA-dependent ATPase (or dATPase) activity that is stimulated effectively by likely substrates (e.g. tRNA) but surprisingly weakly by poly(A). Using an RNA strand-displacement assay, we have demonstrated that Mtr4p can, in the presence of ATP or dATP, unwind the duplex region of a partial duplex RNA substrate in the 3′→5′ direction. We have examined the ability of Mtr4p to bind model RNA substrates in the presence of nucleotides that mimic the stages (i.e. ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free) of the unwinding reaction. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog allows Mtr4p to discriminate between partial duplex RNA substrates, binding a 3′-tailed substrate with 5-fold higher affinity than a 5′-tailed substrate. In addition, Mtr4p displays a marked preference for binding to poly(A) RNA relative to an oligoribonucleotide of the same length and a random sequence. This binding exhibits apparent cooperativity and different dynamic behavior from binding to the random single-stranded RNA. This unique binding mode might be employed primarily for degradation. Mtr4p belongs to the Ski2p family of DEVH-box containing proteins and is required for processing and degradation of a variety of RNA substrates in the nucleus. In particular, Mtr4p is required for creating the 5.8 S ribosomal RNA from its 7 S precursor, proper 3′-end processing of the U4 small nuclear RNA and some small nucleolar RNAs, and degradation of aberrant mRNAs and tRNAs. In these studies we have shown that Mtr4p has RNA-dependent ATPase (or dATPase) activity that is stimulated effectively by likely substrates (e.g. tRNA) but surprisingly weakly by poly(A). Using an RNA strand-displacement assay, we have demonstrated that Mtr4p can, in the presence of ATP or dATP, unwind the duplex region of a partial duplex RNA substrate in the 3′→5′ direction. We have examined the ability of Mtr4p to bind model RNA substrates in the presence of nucleotides that mimic the stages (i.e. ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free) of the unwinding reaction. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog allows Mtr4p to discriminate between partial duplex RNA substrates, binding a 3′-tailed substrate with 5-fold higher affinity than a 5′-tailed substrate. In addition, Mtr4p displays a marked preference for binding to poly(A) RNA relative to an oligoribonucleotide of the same length and a random sequence. This binding exhibits apparent cooperativity and different dynamic behavior from binding to the random single-stranded RNA. This unique binding mode might be employed primarily for degradation. The processing of newly transcribed RNAs is the initial post-transcriptional series of events that culminates in an expressed gene product. Ribosomal, small nuclear, small nucleolar, and messenger RNAs are transcribed as long precursors (pre-RNAs) that must be fragmented and trimmed to yield functional RNAs (1Butler J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 90-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In particular, each ribosomal RNA, small nuclear RNA, and small nucleolar RNA must have its 3′-end exonucleolytically shortened to remove any deleterious or otherwise unnecessary extensions. Any byproducts of the conversion from extended transcripts to functional RNAs must be rapidly degraded, and defective RNAs must be efficiently removed from circulation by 3′→5′ exonucleolytic degradation. From an extensive analysis of nuclear RNA processing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Allmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5399-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 3de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Tollervey D. Linder P.

Biol. 2000; 20: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), it has become clear that this 3′-end maturation is mediated by the DExH-box helicase Mtr4p and the nuclear exosome, a collection of six RNase PH homologues (Rrp41p, Rrp42p, Rrp43p, Rrp45p, Rrp46p, and Mtr3p) that are apparently inactive (5Dziembowski A.

Biol. 2000; 20: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)). Mtr4p is an indispensable partner of the exosome that presumably maintains the momentum of exonucleolytic decay/processing as it moves through structured regions of its substrates. The action of Mtr4p on some RNAs occurs in the context of the TRAMP 2The abbreviations used are: TRAMPTrf/Air/Mtr4 polyadenylation complexFlfluoresceinEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaysssingle-strandeddsdouble-strandedAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphateMBPmaltose-binding proteinCHESN-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: TRAMPTrf/Air/Mtr4 polyadenylation complexFlfluoresceinEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaysssingle-strandeddsdouble-strandedAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphateMBPmaltose-binding proteinCHESN-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. complex, which consists of a poly(A) polymerase (Trf4p or Trf5p), a zinc-knuckle protein (Air1p or Air2p), and Mtr4p (9LaCava J.

Blank D. Dettwiler S. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keith G. Keller W. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e189Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Addition of poly(A) to substrates to help maintain the momentum of 3′→5′ exonucleolytic decay is prevalent in bacteria (11Xu F. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1995; 374: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Xu F. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and might reflect the ancestral purpose of 3′ poly(A) extensions on RNAs. Experimental evidence has just begun to emerge that polyadenylation can promote pre-mRNA decay in mammalian cells, an indication that this is an evolutionarily conserved feature (13West S. Gromak N. Norbury C.J. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Recent experiments have begun to shed light on the role of Mtr4p in nuclear RNA processing, demonstrating that Mtr4p impacts a diverse array of pre-RNA substrates. Mtr4p in conjunction with the nuclear exosome plays a key part in ribosome biogenesis via the production of the 5.8 S ribosomal RNA, an essential component of the 60 S ribosomal subunit, from its precursor 7 S ribosomal RNA (2Allmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5399-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Mtr4p also has a role in ensuring ribosome function by processing small nucleolar RNAs (4van Hoof A. Lennertz P. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In addition, Mtr4p helps scrutinize mRNAs before they exit the nucleus. Pre-mRNAs that exhibit adenylation or splicing abnormalities are efficiently degraded by Mtr4p and the exosome (14Hilleren P. McCarthy T. Rosbash M. Parker R. Jensen T.H. Nature. 2001; 413: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 15Bousquet-Antonelli C. Presutti C. Tollervey D. Cell. 2000; 102: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and read-through transcripts are either degraded or rescued as functional messenger ribonucleoproteins (16Torchet C. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Milligan L. Thompson E. Kufel J. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1285-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mtr4p also participates in the 3′-end maturation of small nuclear RNAs such as the U4 small nuclear RNA, which is part of the U4/U5·U6 trimer recruited during spliceosome assembly. In the context of the TRAMP complex, Mtr4p helps remove defective tRNAs before they are exported to the cytoplasm to assist in translation. Specifically, hypomodified tRNA Meti has been recently identified as a substrate of the TRAMP-exosome complex (10Vanacova S. Wolf J. Martin G. Blank D. Dettwiler S. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keith G. Keller W. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e189Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Degradation is highly specific for the hypomodified form of tRNA Meti and might involve multiple rounds of polyadenylation and exonucleolytic decay (10Vanacova S. Wolf J. Martin G. Blank D. Dettwiler S. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keith G. Keller W. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e189Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar).In addition to its role in post-transcriptional processing, recent evidence has emerged that the TRAMP-exosome complex is involved in regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level (17Arigo J.T. Carroll K.L. Ames J.M. Corden J.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 641-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The gene NRD1 is autoregulated by premature transcription termination with the aid of the protein Nab3p. Surprisingly, the TRAMP complex is likely required for the termination event and not just for degrading prematurely terminated transcripts as elevated levels of the full-length NRD1 transcript appear in both TRAMP and exosome mutant strains (17Arigo J.T. Carroll K.L. Ames J.M. Corden J.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 641-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, other genes regulated by Nrd1p and Nab3p are also processed by the TRAMP-exosome complex (17Arigo J.T. Carroll K.L. Ames J.M. Corden J.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 641-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Vasiljeva L. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), indicating that the premature termination regulation scheme might be more prevalent than previously envisioned.Based on the content of conserved helicase sequence motifs (Q, I, Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, and VI, see Fig. 1A), Mtr4p belongs to superfamily 2, which includes the DEAD-, DEAH-, DExH-, and DExD-box families of helicases. Mtr4p is typically grouped with Ski2p-like helicases because of its functional relationship to the cytoplasmic exosome partner Ski2p (19de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that both of these DEVH-box-containing proteins partner with the exosome (Mtr4p in the nucleus, Ski2p in the cytoplasm) to ensure the momentum of 3′→5′ exonuclease activity is maintained. Recent genetics experiments have demonstrated that the putative helicase motifs of Mtr4p are critical for its function in vivo. In particular, mutation of the conserved lysine of motif I (Lys-177) results in a dominant negative growth defect, as does mutation of the conserved serine of motif III (Ser-293) (20Bernstein K.A. Granneman S. Lee A.V. Manickam S. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1195-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mutation of the conserved aspartate of the DExH-box motif (motif II, Asp-262) to alanine has no obvious yeast phenotype (20Bernstein K.A. Granneman S. Lee A.V. Manickam S. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1195-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Motif II is thought to impact both NTP binding and hydrolysis (21Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1590-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and it is unclear why this mutation fails to impair yeast growth. In addition to the above helicase motifs, Mtr4p contains ∼500 amino acids at its C terminus that have no known function. This region is well conserved among Mtr4p and Ski2 homologues, yet is uncharacterized. What role the C-terminal portion of Mtr4p plays in its various activities is at present unclear.Here we examine the biochemical activities of recombinant S. cerevisiae Mtr4p. We demonstrate that it has nucleic acid-dependent nucleotide triphosphatase activity that is specific for either ATP or dATP. We also demonstrate that Mtr4p can, in the presence of ATP or dATP, unwind duplex RNA in the 3′→5′ direction. Mtr4p also possesses single-stranded RNA-binding activity that is greatly influenced by both the presence and nature of bound nucleotide. Finally, Mtr4p preferentially binds to a short poly(A) substrate, adopting a unique binding mode that might be well suited for promoting degradation of RNA substrates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and Purification of Full-length S. cerevisiae Mtr4p–The MTR4 gene was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA using the Herculase (Stratagene) DNA polymerase and PCR primers for the sense (ATCGTGCAGGTACCGATGGATTCTACTGATCTGTTCGATG; the initiating ATG codon is underlined) and antisense (TGCAATCGGAATTCCTATAAATACAAAGAACCAGCAGATACG) strands. The resulting PCR product was then cloned into a dual His6-maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion vector. The sequence of the cloned gene was then verified before undertaking subsequent experiments. Rosetta2(DE3) (Novagen) cells transformed with the Mtr4p expression vector were grown to an A600 of 0.6, and expression of the recombinant protein was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The cells were grown for 16 h at 25 °C and harvested by centrifugation. Following high pressure disruption of the cells and removal of the cell debris by centrifugation, the protein was purified as described under “Results.”Creation of the K177A Mutant–To change the lysine in Motif I to alanine (K177A), the wild-type Mtr4p expression plasmid was mutagenized using the QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The integrity of the entire open reading frame and the presence of the desired mutation were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.Nucleotide Hydrolysis Assays–(d)NTPase activity was evaluated by quantifying the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from (d)NTP hydrolysis using an acidic ammonium molybdate solution containing malachite green (22Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). In each experiment, the micromolar amount of Pi released was determined by comparing the experimental change in A650 nm with the absorbance change generated by addition of a phosphate standard (0.045 μmol) to a mock reaction lacking (d)NTP. This assay was used to determine both the nucleotide and substrate specificities of Mtr4p. A typical assay testing nucleotide specificity (50 μl) contained 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg poly(A) RNA (GE Healthcare), 2 μm Mtr4p, and 2 mm (d)NTP. The (d)NTPase reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. 750 μl of a malachite green-molybdate reagent was then added, and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Following the incubation, the A650 nm for each sample was measured. Each set of measurements included an appropriate control reaction lacking protein. In assays designed to determine the substrate specificity of Mtr4p, the conditions were modified to include 40 nm substrate (ssRNA, dsRNA, tRNA, ssDNA, or dsDNA) and 0.3 μm Mtr4p. Each of the model substrates used for these reactions (i.e. ssRNA, dsRNA, ssDNA, and dsDNA) consisted of short oligonucleotides of random sequence (see Table 1). The tRNA used was type X-SA tRNA from S. cerevisiae (Sigma-Aldrich).TABLE 1Stimulation of the (d)ATPase Activity of Mtr4p by various substratesSubstrate (40 nm, normalizedaConcentration of 20-nucleotide units, except for the 40-nucleotide ssRNA (see footnote e))Nucleotide-Fold stimulationbRelative to a reaction lacking substrate, each calculated in micromoles of Pi·min–1·μmol Mtr4p–1; expressed as the mean value ± its standard errorUUGAAUACAUAUUUAUGACAATP8.6 ± 1.1dATP6.6 ± 1.8UUGAAUACAUAUUUAUGACAATP1.9 ± 0.8AACUUAUGUAUAAAUACUGUdATP2.3 ± 1.7Type X-SA tRNA (Sigma)ATP12.0 ± 3.8dATP37.3 ± 13.1ATTACTCTCCCAGACCATAGTCGGGTACTGTTTCAGAATP3.2 ± 1.0dATP4.3 ± 2.9ATTACTCTCCCAGACCATAGTCGGGTACTGTTTCAGAATP2.8 ± 1.5TAATGAGAGGGTCTGGTATCAGCCCATGACAAAGTCTdATP5.4 ± 3.1Poly(A) (100–200 nt avg.)cBased on the sedimentation coefficient for that lot of poly(A) (GE Healthcare)ATP1.1 ± 1.0dATP2.2 ± 1.3Poly(A) (∼20,000 nt avg.)dAverage molecular mass of 7 MDa (Fluka)ATP1.6 ± 0.7dATP0.6 ± 1.6UCUCGCGUCAUGGUUACUAUUUGAAUACAUAUUUAUGACAe40 nm, not normalizedATP9.9 ± 3.1ATPfActivity of the K177A mutant (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1A)1.1 ± 0.1dATP14.6 ± 4.8A20ATP3.0 ± 0.5dATP1.9 ± 0.5a Concentration of 20-nucleotide units, except for the 40-nucleotide ssRNA (see footnote e)b Relative to a reaction lacking substrate, each calculated in micromoles of Pi·min–1·μmol Mtr4p–1; expressed as the mean value ± its standard errorc Based on the sedimentation coefficient for that lot of poly(A) (GE Healthcare)d Average molecular mass of 7 MDa (Fluka)e 40 nm, not normalizedf Activity of the K177A mutant (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1A) Open table in a new tab We also employed the coupled pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase assay to assess the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of ATPase activity as described (23Seifried S.E. Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13511-13514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, Mtr4p (100 nm) was incubated with varying concentrations of ATP (0–3.5 mm) and 250 nm of a 40-nucleotide ssRNA (substrate number 1 in Fig. 6A) at 37 °C in a reaction volume of 0.5 ml containing 50 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 3.5 units of pyruvate kinase, and 5 units of lactate dehydrogenase. In a parallel experiment, Mtr4p was incubated with amounts of substrate 1 varying from 0 to 250 nm, 4 mm ATP under the same conditions as outlined above. Oxidation of NADH to NAD+, which is coupled to ATP hydrolysis, was continuously monitored at 338 nm in a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer. Initial rates were calculated from the absorbance data using an extinction coefficient (ϵ338) of -6220 m-1 cm-1. A blank rate omitting ATP was subtracted from the initial rate at each ATP or RNA concentration. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the rates as a function of ATP or RNA concentration to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the KaleidaGraph software package (Synergy Software).FIGURE 6Evaluation of Mtr4p binding to a series of RNA substrates. A, substrates used for evaluation of binding by fluorescence anisotropy. The location of the fluorescein label in each substrate is indicated by a star. B, representative binding isotherm for the association of Mtr4p with a single-stranded 40-nucleotide RNA (substrate 1 in A) in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP. Binding was analyzed by fluorescence anisotropy as described under “Experimental Procedures” and plotted as a function of Mtr4p concentration. The curve overlaid on the data (solid black line) represents the best fit of the data to the single site binding model described by Equation 1. Each datum represents the average of three independent measurements. A plot of the residual values (lower panel) for the curve fit (i.e. the difference between the calculated anisotropy from the curve fit and the experimental data) shows no bias for data subsets, indicating a good fit to the single site model.

Following incubation, the reaction was brought to a final volume of 60 μl, and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. The reaction was then heat-inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min. Labeled RNA was extracted once with phenol:CHCl3:isoamyl alcohol, and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by passing the extracted RNA through a G-25 spin column (Ambion).RNA Binding–RNA binding affinity was measured using a fluorescence anisotropy-based assay according to the method of Brewer and colleagues (24Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The anisotropy measurements were conducted using a Beacon 2000 variable temperature fluorescence polarization system equipped with fluorescein excitation (490 nm) and emission (535 nm) filters. A typical reaction (100 μl) contained a limiting concentration (0.2 nm) of an RNA substrate labeled with fluorescein at its 5′-end, Mtr4p (0–2000 nm), binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 25 mm NaCl), 2 mm adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) or ADP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2. The polarimeter was operated in static mode with each sample (including all components other than the substrate RNA) read as blank prior to addition of fluorescein-labeled RNA. Following substrate addition, samples were incubated for a time increment empirically determined to allow the system to reach equilibrium (see “Results” and below), before anisotropy was measured. Binding isotherms were obtained by plotting the measured anisotropy (each datum represents the average of multiple independent measurements) versus the concentration of Mtr4p. The total intensity of emission was monitored concurrent with anisotropy to ensure that interactions between Mtr4p, and the RNA substrate did not affect the quantum yield of the fluorophore. In cases where the total fluorescence emission varied as a function of added protein concentration, an appropriate correction factor (26Dandliker W.B. Hsu M.L. Levin J. Rao B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 74: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol.

Springer Science and Business Media, Inc., New York2005: 223-243Google Scholar) was applied to the measured anisotropies. The equilibrium association constant was calculated from the binding isotherm using GraphPad Prism version 3.03 and Equation 1 (29Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Bolikal S. Chuang K.Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44450-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), Atotal=ARNA+AcomplexKa[P]1+Ka[P](Eq. 1) where Atotal represents the total anisotropy, ARNA is the intrinsic anisotropy of the RNA, Acomplex is the anisotropy of the saturated protein-RNA complex, [P] is the protein concentration, and Ka is the association constant. This binding model assumes that one binding site exists on the substrate RNA. The appropriateness of the single binding site model was evaluated by the agreement between the observed and calculated binding isotherms, the random distribution of residuals, and a lack of multiple bound species observed in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). In cases where the single-site model was deemed inappropriate, binding isotherms were analyzed using a variant of the Hill equation (30Heilman-Miller S.L. Thirumalai D. Woodson S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), Atotal=Acomp+[Acomp-ARNA]×([P]/[P]m)h1+([P]/[P]m)h(Eq. 2) where Atotal is the measured anisotropy, Acomp is the anisotropy of the saturated protein-RNA complex, ARNA is the inherent anisotropy of the RNA substrate, and h is the Hill coefficient. This equation also returns an estimate of the midpoint of the binding isotherm ([P]m), which, in the case of a single binding site (i.e. h is constrained to be 1.0), is equivalent to the Kd.To qualitatively assess RNA binding, and in particular to determine the number of bound species, EMSAs were performed as follows. Mtr4p at the indicated concentrations was incubated with 5 nm of each 32P-labeled RNA substrate (prepared as described above) in a low ionic strength buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm AMP-PNP, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 6% glycerol) for 30 min at 25 °C, followed by incubation for 15 min on ice. A 6% native polyacrylamide gel containing 10% glycerol was prepared and run at 90 V for 30 min in 1× Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer at 4 °C after loading samples. The samples were then electrophoresed at 150 V for 3 h at 4 °C, and the results were evaluated by autoradiography using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager.RNA-Protein Complex Dissociation Kinetics–To determine how fast Mtr4p releases single-stranded substrates, we incubated a fixed amount of protein (150 nm) with the fluorescein-labeled ssRNA and measured the decrease in anisotropy over time in response to a competitive challenge with unlabeled ssRNA added in 5000-fold excess. The solution conditions were identical to those employed in the equilibrium binding experiments. Complex lifetimes were measured for a 20-nucleotide ssRNA with a random sequence (substrate 2 in Fig. 6A) and a 20-nucleotide poly(A) (substrate A20), each in the presence and absence of AMP-PNP. The time-dependent decrease in anisotropy was fit to an exponential equation, A=A0e-kt+B(Eq. 3) where A is the measured anisotropy at time t, A0 is the measured anisotropy in the absence of unlabeled competitor RNA, k is the rate constant, t is time, and B is the minimum anisotropy (i.e. the plateau of the reaction).Competition Assay–The ability of the A20 substrate to compete with substrate 2 for binding to Mtr4p was determined as follows. Mtr4p (150 nm) was incubated with a mixture of 0.2 nm 5′-fluorescein-labeled A20 (Fl-A20) mixed with unlabeled competitor RNA (either substrate 2 or A20) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 nm. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, a time determined empirically to be sufficient for the system to reach equilibrium (see Fig. 7A). The anisotropy was then measured and analyzed as a function of competitor RNA concentration. The apparent inhibition constant (Ki,app) of the competitor RNA, used as an estimate of the relative preference of Mtr4p for that substrate, is estimated from plots of anisotropy versus competitor concentration via Equation 4, A=ARNA+Amax1+([I]/Ki,app)(Eq. 4) where A is the measured anisotropy, ARNA is the anisotropy of the RNA alone, Amax is the maximum observed anisotropy shift (i.e. the anisotropy in the absence of competitor RNA), and [I]is the competitor RNA concentration.FIGURE 7Preferential binding of Mtr4p to a short poly(A) oligonucleotide. A, the lifetime of the Mtr4p-A20 complex is significantly longer than that of a complex between Mtr4p and substrate 2. A pre-formed complex of Mtr4p and either Fl-A20 (left panel) or Fl-substrate 2 was challenged with a 5000-fold molar excess of unlabeled RNA and the anisotropy measured as a function of time. Each datum represents the mean value of multiple measurements. The off rate (koff) of each complex was determined by fitting the anisotropy versus time curves to Equation 3. The lifetime of each complex was determined both in the presence and absence of AMP-PNP. The lifetime of the Mtr4p A20 complex is 4-fold longer in the absence of AMP-PNP than in its presence, whereas the lifetimes of the two Mtr4p-substrate 2 complexes are statistically indistinguishable.

Mtr4p was incubated with a mixture of Fl-A20 and unlabeled competitor RNA both in the presence and absence of AMP-PNP as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the anisotropy versus competitor concentration was plotted.

https://openalex.org/W2036064501,"Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are the primary regulators of extracellular glutamate concentrations in the central nervous system. Their dysfunction may contribute to several neurological diseases. To date, five distinct mammalian glutamate transporters have been cloned. In brain, EAAC1 (excitatory amino acid carrier 1) is the primary neuronal glutamate transporter, localized on the perisynaptic membranes that are near release sites. Despite its potential importance in synaptic actions, little is known concerning the regulation of EAAC1 trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface. Previously, we identified an EAAC1-associated protein, GTRAP3-18, an ER protein that prevents ER exit of EAAC1 when induced. Here we show that RTN2B, a member of the reticulon protein family that mainly localizes in the ER and ER exit sites interacts with EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18. EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18 bind to different regions of RTN2B. Each protein can separately and independently form complexes with EAAC1. RTN2B enhances ER exit and the cell surface composition of EAAC1 in heterologous cells. Expression of short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RTN2B decreases the EAAC1 protein level in neurons. Overall, our results suggest that RTN2B functions as a positive regulator in the delivery of EAAC1 from the ER to the cell surface. These studies indicate that transporter exit from the ER controlled by the interaction with its ER binding partner represents a critical regulatory step in glutamate transporter trafficking to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1967773283,"Hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for development of vascular diabetic complications. Vascular dysfunction in diabetics manifests in a tissue-specific manner; macrovasculature is affected by atherosclerotic lesions, and microvascular complications are described as “aberrant angiogenesis”: in the same patient angiogenesis is increased in some tissues (e.g. retinal neovascularization) and decreased in others (e.g. in skin). Molecular cell- and tissue-specific mechanisms regulating the response of vasculature to hyperglycemia remain unclear. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a potent antiangiogenic and proatherogenic protein, has been implicated in the development of several vascular diabetic complications (atherosclerosis, nephropathy, and cardiomyopathy). This study examines cell type-specific regulation of production of thrombospondin-1 by high glucose. We previously reported the increased expression of TSP-1 in the large arteries of diabetic animals. mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated in response to high glucose. Unlike in macrovascular cells, TSP-1 protein levels are dramatically decreased in response to high glucose in microvascular endothelial cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). This down-regulation is post-transcriptional; mRNA levels are increased. In situ mRNA hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that the level of mRNA is up-regulated in RPE of diabetic rats, whereas the protein level is decreased. This cell type-specific posttranscriptional suppression of TSP-1 production in response to high glucose in microvascular endothelial cells and RPE is controlled by untranslated regions of TSP-1 mRNA that regulate coupling of TSP-1 mRNA to polysomes and its translation.

Despite the significant advances in the therapeutic methods to control blood glucose and insulin levels in diabetic patients, the precise regulation of these levels remains a problem. Vascular diabetic complications remain most prevalent and dangerous and account for the greatest numbers of deaths and hospitalizations in diabetic patients. The molecular basis for the vascular complications of diabetes is not well understood. Recent reports indicate that both microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes correlate directly with glucose levels in both patients and animal models (1Martin A. Komada M.R. Sane D.C.

Patients with diabetes have increased TSP-1 in their plasma and kidneys (20Bayraktar M. Dundar S. Kirazli S. Teletar F. J. Int. Med. Res. 1994; 22: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The expression of TSP-1 in mesangial cells was increased by high levels of glucose (21Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol.

A peptide blocking the activation of transforming growth factor-β activation by TSP-1 prevented progression of cardiac fibrosis and improved cardiac function in a rat model, implicating TSP-1 in development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (25Belmadani S. Bernal J. Wei C.C. Pallero M.A. Dell'italia L. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Berecek K.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported increased levels of TSP-1 in macrovessels of diabetic Zucker rats (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, the major cell types present in large vessels responded to stimulation with high glucose concentrations by increasing their expression of TSP-1. TSP-1 is produced by microvascular cells and retinal cells (27Hiscott P. Larkin G. Robey H.L. Orr G. Grierson I. Eye. 1992; 6: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Sheibani N.

Gallagher J.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and, in contrast to large vessels and kidney, TSP-1 levels in the diabetic eye are significantly decreased (28Sheibani N. Sorenson C.M. Cornelius L.A. Frazier W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because TSP-1 is a potent antiangiogenic agent that in the normal eye may prevent uncontrolled growth of microvessels, such down-regulation of TSP-1 in the diabetic eye suggests its involvement in diabetic retinopathy. A direct effect of TSP-1 deficiency on retinal vascularity has been demonstrated recently in TSP-1-deficient mice (30Wang S. Wu Z. Sorenson C.M. Lawler J. Sheibani N. Dev.

Elevated glucose levels are associated with the development of diabetic vascular complications, and regulation of TSP-1 production may control both macro- and microvascular changes. The aberrant angiogenesis in diabetics (increased angiogenesis in some tissues and decreased in others in the same patient), which does not have any mechanistic explanation to date, may be dependent on a cell type- and tissue-specific production of regulators of angiogenesis. TSP-1, one of the most potent antiangiogenic proteins, is a good candidate for such a regulator. We now report a finding of a cell type- and cell origin-specific post-transcriptional mechanism of down-regulation of TSP-1 expression by glucose. This mechanism is not present in endothelial cells (EC) from large blood vessels, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), and fibroblasts, where the transcriptional increase in TSP-1 mRNA upon acute glucose stimulation of cells leads to the increased expression of TSP-1 protein (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, in microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) and in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, the expression of TSP-1 protein is dramatically down-regulated despite increased TSP-1 mRNA levels. The mechanism controlling TSP-1 production is activated by high glucose, operates at the level of mRNA translation and is controlled by untranslated regions of mRNA. The finding of such a cell type- and cell origin-specific mechanism of suppression of the protein production may provide a molecular basis for aberrant angiogenesis in diabetic individuals. Thus, cell- and tissue-specific regulation of TSP-1 production may represent an important link between diabetes, hyperglycemia, and a variety of vascular complications of diabetes. Cell Culture, Stimulation with Glucose, TSP-1 Protein, and mRNA Detection—Primary vascular cells were purchased from Cambrex or kindly provided by the investigators listed in the Acknowledgments. The cell lines were from ATCC unless otherwise stated. CDC.EU/HMEC1 were obtained from Dr. Candal (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA). The stimulation with 30 mm glucose was performed as described (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). TSP-1 protein and mRNA were detected by Western or Northern blotting as described before (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Labeling of Protein with [35S]Methionine and Immunoprecipitation of Labeled TSP-1—Labeling of proteins began by the addition of 10 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine for 2 h either 1) prior to stimulation with glucose in the case of experiments on protein degradation/secretion or 2) 22 h after the start of stimulation with glucose in the case of detection of de novo synthesized TSP-1 protein. In protein degradation/secretion experiments, synthesis of labeled protein was stopped by an excess of cold methionine 1 h before the experimental time point zero. TSP-1 was precipitated from cell lysates overnight at 4 °C using anti-TSP-1 antibody (Lab Vision), followed by a 2-h incubation with anti-mouse IgG antibody (Bio-Rad) and protein A/G magnetic beads (Dynal). Precipitated proteins were resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences) to detect TSP-1. Short Pulse Labeling—200 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine was added for 5 min to RF/6A cells treated with 30 mm glucose for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 h. Prior to glucose stimulation, the cells were incubated overnight in low glucose, 0.2% fetal bovine serum medium without methionine. Labeling was stopped by the addition of excess of cold methionine and 10 μg/ml cyclohexamide, and the cells were immediately lysed. Immunoprecipitation of TSP-1 was performed as described above. Reporter Construct Design—5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) of TSP-1 mRNA were amplified by PCR from clones IMAGE 6718543 (MRC Geneservice, Cambridge, UK) and IMAGE 6028666 (ATCC), respectively. We used primers 5′-TCTAGAGTCATCAAATTGTTGATTGAAAG-3′ and 5′-GGCCGGCCGTTGTTCCTTGTACATAAGAA-3′ for 5′-UTR and 5′-AAGCCTAGCCGCTGCGCCCGAGCTGGCC-3′ and 5′-CCATGGTGGAGCTGTTGGTGCCCAGCAGG-3′ for 3′-UTR. 5′ was cloned into HindIII and NcoI restriction sites of the pGL3 Control vector (Promega), and 3′ was cloned in FseI and XbaI sites of the same vector. Thus, the final constructs included the full 5′-UTR inserted immediately before the luciferase cDNA, the full 3′-UTR inserted immediately after the luciferase cDNA, or both full 5′-UTR and full 3′-UTR. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assay—Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) was used for transient transfections according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 24-h recovery, full growth media were changed to a low glucose medium (5 mm or 1 mg/ml glucose, 5% fetal bovine serum) 24 h prior to a 24-h stimulation with 30 mm glucose. Luciferase activity was measured in 100 μg of total protein using reagents from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractionation of RNA on Sucrose Gradient—RF/6A cells transfected with TSP1–5′,3′-UTR/luciferase cDNA plasmid were grown in 150-mm cell culture dishes to 100% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 0.1% G418 (Mediatech, Inc.). Medium was changed to a low glucose (5 mm) medium (0.2% fetal bovine serum) 24 h before the experiment. Cyclohexamide (CHX; 50 μg/ml) was added to each plate 5 min before lysing. The cells were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing CHX 50 μg/ml, and then the cells were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline/CHX and transferred to a tube, collected at 600 × g, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline/CHX, resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold polysome lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl in DEPC (diethyl pyrocarbonate) water; 10 mm DTT, 100 units/ml ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), 200 μg/ml CHX, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), passed through a 27-gauge needle, incubated on ice for 5 min, and spun down at 1000 × g for 5 min. 1 mg of protein (0.5 ml) was layered on 4.5 ml of 30% sucrose prepared in polysome lysis buffer and spun down at 150,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant (nonpolysomal fraction) was collected into a new tube and precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3 mol/liter NaOAC, 2.5 volumes of ethanol overnight at -80 °C. RNA was purified from nonpolysomal fraction using TRIzol reagent. The pellet (polysomal fraction) was resuspended in 100 μl of polysome lysis buffer, and RNA was extracted with 750 μl of TRIzol reagent. Real Time RT-PCR—First strand cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) from 1 μg of RNA isolated from polysomal or nonpolysomal fractions. iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) was used for PCR. The primers used were: luciferase, 5′-gacaattgcactgatcatgaactcct and 5′-cagcgcactttgaatcttgtaatcct; TSP-1, 5′-ccaaagacgggtttcattagag and 5′-ttcaggtcagagaagaacacca; β-actin, 5′-catgtacgttgctatccaggc and ctccttaatgtcacgcacgat. Ct values for TSP-1 and luciferase were normalized to the Ct value for β-actin (dCt), dCt values for each time point of glucose treatment were normalized to the control value (ddCt), and the value for fold change represents the exponential of ddCt. β-Actin Ct remained constant in response to glucose treatment in all of the cell types in both polysomal and nonpolysomal fractions. In Situ mRNA Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry—12-Week-old control and diabetic Zucker rats (Genetic Models, Inc.) were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation. Rat eyes were enucleated and placed into ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, following a penetrating incision made through the middle of the cornea. After overnight fixation at 4 °C, anterior segments and the lens were removed under preparative microscope, and the posterior eyecups were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 10-μm-thick sections. In situ mRNA hybridization was performed as described previously (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with minor modifications: biotinylated anti-TSP-1 antibody (Lab Vision) and Texas Red-labeled streptavidin were used. Statistical Analysis—All of the described experiments were performed at least three times, and the data were presented as the mean values ± S.E. The p values were determined from the t test using Microsoft Excel. Differences with p values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The analyses of images obtained using in situ mRNA hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed using ImagePro 4.5.1 in eye sections obtained from four eyes for each experimental condition (30 microscopic fields from each eye). Increased TSP-1 Production in Macrovascular EC—We recently reported that the expression of TSP-1 is increased in the aorta and carotid artery of diabetic Zucker rats at the protein and mRNA levels (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This increase in production of the potent antiangiogenic protein TSP-1 in macrovessels was associated with the decreased number of vasa vasorum, or small blood vessels, growing through the vascular wall and feeding the inner layers of vascular cells. TSP-1 was up-regulated by glucose stimulation in all major vascular wall cell types from large vessels (EC, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts) in vitro (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Both the protein and mRNA for TSP-1 were rapidly up-regulated after stimulation of cells with 10–30 mm d-glucose but not biologically inactive l-glucose or sorbitol (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Raman P. Krukovets I. Marinic T.E. Bornstein P. Stenina O.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5704-5714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition to our published data, similar experiments have been performed in human pulmonary artery EC, several isolates of human aortic EC, and human coronary artery EC with similar results (Fig. 1). In all the isolates of primary EC from large blood vessels, TSP-1 protein production was increased in response to high glucose. Decreased TSP-1 Production in MVEC and RPE in Response to High Glucose—In contrast to the increased TSP-1 protein production in cultured cell types from macrovessels (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), levels of TSP-1 were dramatically reduced in lysates of primary MVEC and RPE (human dermal MVEC, rat lung MVEC, and human RPE) in response to stimulation with 30 mm glucose (Fig. 2). The decreased levels of TSP-1 in primary MVEC in response to high glucose were described earlier by Sheibani et al. (28Sheibani N. Sorenson C.M. Cornelius L.A. Frazier W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cell lines derived from MVEC and RPE (MVEC, CDC.EU/HMEC1 and RF/6A; RPE, ARPE19 and D407) retained this ability to suppress TSP-1 production upon incubation with high glucose (Fig. 2), suggesting that the differential regulation of TSP-1 in MVEC and RPE versus macrovascular EC and other cells from large blood vessels is an inherited property that is preserved in cell culture and in transformed cell lines. All of the MVEC and RPE produced high levels of TSP-1 in basal conditions. The dissimilarity in the regulation of TSP-1 protein expression by high glucose between macrovascular cell types versus MVEC and RPE is not due to a difference in transcriptional regulation or to a decreased stability of TSP-1 mRNA, because mRNA levels were increased in response to high glucose in all cell types (Fig. 3), similar to macrovascular cells (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These disparities between mRNA levels and protein levels identified the mechanism of TSP-1 regulation in MVEC and RPE as post-transcriptional. Decreased TSP-1 Protein Synthesis in Glucose-stimulated Cells—Decreased levels of TSP-1 protein in cell lysates may result from an increased rate of TSP-1 secretion, increased rate of protein degradation, or a post-transcriptional regulation of protein synthesis. To address these possibilities, we: 1) examined the levels of TSP-1 in cell culture supernatants; similar to the levels of TSP-1 in cell lysates, the TSP-1 levels in supernatants were decreased (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the secretion of TSP-1 is not increased in response to high glucose and cannot account for the decrease in intracellular TSP-1; and 2) monitored the change in the levels of prelabeled intracellular TSP-1 in control and high glucose-stimulated cells (Fig. 4B). In ARPE19 and RF/6A, proteins were labeled by the addition of 10 μCi of [35S]methionine for 2 h, and then an excess of cold methionine was added for 1 h to stop the synthesis of newly labeled protein, and the cells were stimulated with high glucose for 1 h. Starting at this time (time point zero), the cells were incubated for 15 min to 20 h and lysed. Labeled TSP-1 synthesized before stimulation with glucose was immunoprecipitated using two anti-TSP-1 antibodies (Labvision; Ab4 that recognizes the middle part of TSP-1 and Ab3 that recognizes the N terminus of TSP-1) and resolved in SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4B, the amount of labeled TSP-1 in cell lysates declined with time, presumably because of the secretion of the protein. However, there was no difference in labeled TSP-1 levels between samples from control cells and high glucose-stimulated cells at any given time point. This observation suggested that the decrease in TSP-1 levels was not due to the increased secretion or degradation of the protein but rather was due to decreased synthesis of the protein. To confirm that the synthesis of TSP-1 protein is inhibited in response to high glucose, we have performed a short pulse labeling (200 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine) of newly synthesized proteins 1, 2, 3, and 6 h after stimulation of RF/6A with high glucose. Labeled TSP-1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates and detected in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4C). The difference in the amount of TSP-1 synthesized during the pulse time (5 min) was detected as early as 2 h after the glucose treatment, and the newly synthesized TSP-1 was barely detected after 6 h of treatment. Additionally, ARPE19 and HASMC were stimulated with 30 mm glucose, and the newly synthesized proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h prior to the cell harvesting at the 24-h time point. ARPE19 and HASMC, two cell types with different mechanisms of TSP-1 protein regulation in response to glucose, were used in these experiments. TSP-1 was immunoprecipitated from the control of each cell type, and the cells were stimulated with 30 mm glucose for 24 h. At 24 h of stimulation, up-regulation of TSP-1 reached maximal levels in HASMC (26Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Wang K. Zhou Z. Forudi F. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3209-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas maximum down-regulation of TSP-1 in ARPE19 is detected at the same time point. Although in HASMC the synthesis of TSP-1 was dramatically increased in cells stimulated with high glucose as compared with control cells, in ARPE the synthesis of new TSP-1 was notably decreased (Fig. 4D). No labeled protein was detected at this time point in the medium, suggesting that 2 h (labeling time) are not sufficient for the secretion of detectable amount of TSP-1, and the decrease of newly synthesized TSP-1 in lysates in cells stimulated with high glucose is not a result of increased secretion. These series of experiments confirmed that the decrease in intracellular TSP-1 is due to the decreased synthesis of the protein rather than its increased secretion or degradation.

We examined the expression of luciferase in cells transfected with plasmids containing the complete 5′-UTR of TSP-1 cloned in front of the luciferase cDNA, the complete 3′-UTR cloned immediately at the 3′ of the luciferase cDNA, or both 5′ and 3′-UTR. HASMC, bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), ARPE19, and retinal microvascular endothelial cell line RF/6A were transiently transfected with these constructs and stimulated with 30 mm glucose for 24 h. In response to high glucose, the activity of 5′TSP-1/luciferase was increased up to 4-fold (Fig. 5) in all of the cell lines tested. Luciferase expression was inhibited by TSP-1 3′-UTR in all four cell types; the basal expression was inhibited by several orders of magnitude (no"

Clues to one potential function recently emerged with the finding that activation of Galphaz inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in an insulinoma cell line (Kimple, M. E., Nixon, A. B., Kelly, P., Bailey, C. L., Young, K. H., Fields, T. A., and Casey, P. J. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 31708-31713). To extend this study in vivo, a Galphaz knock-out mouse model was utilized to determine whether Galphaz function plays a role in the inhibition of insulin secretion. No differences were discovered in the gross morphology of the pancreatic islets or in the islet DNA, protein, or insulin content between Galphaz-null and wild-type mice. There was also no difference between the insulin sensitivity of Galphaz-null mice and wild-type controls, as measured by insulin tolerance tests. Galphaz-null mice did, however, display increased plasma insulin concentrations and a corresponding increase in glucose clearance following intraperitoneal and oral glucose challenge as compared with wild-type controls. The increased plasma insulin observed in Galphaz-null mice is most likely a direct result of enhanced insulin secretion, since pancreatic islets isolated from Galphaz-null mice exhibited significantly higher glucose-stimulated insulin secretion than those of wild-type mice. Finally, the increased insulin secretion observed in Galphaz-null islets appears to be due to the relief of a tonic inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, as cAMP production was significantly increased in Galphaz-null islets in the absence of exogenous stimulation. These findings indicate that Galphaz may be a potential new target for therapeutics aimed at ameliorating beta-cell dysfunction in Type 2 diabetes."

Previous investigations have suggested that a limited subset of B. henselae isolates may be associated with human disease. In the present study, 182 human and feline B. henselae isolates from Europe, North America and Australia were analysed by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) to detect any associations between sequence type (ST), host species and geographical distribution of the isolates. A total of 14 sequence types were detected, but over 66% (16/24) of the isolates recovered from human disease corresponded to a single genotype, ST1, and this type was detected in all three continents. In contrast, 27.2% (43/158) of the feline isolates corresponded to ST7, but this ST was not recovered from humans and was restricted to Europe. The difference in host association of STs 1 (human) and 7 (feline) was statistically significant (P< or =0.001). eBURST analysis assigned the 14 STs to three clonal lineages, which contained two or more STs, and a singleton comprising ST7. These groups were broadly consistent with a neighbour-joining tree, although splits decomposition analysis was indicative of a history of recombination. These data indicate that B. henselae lineages differ in their virulence properties for humans and contribute to a better understanding of the population structure of B. henselae."
https://openalex.org/W2022439615,"Motor cortex output is capable of considerable reorganization, which involves modulation of excitability within the cortex. Does such reorganization also involve changes beyond the cortex, at the level of throughput from single motor cortex neurons to muscle activity? We examined such throughput during a paradigm that provided incentive for enhancing functional connectivity from motor cortex neurons to muscles. Short-latency throughput from a recorded neuron to muscle activity not present during some behavioral epochs often appeared during others. Such changes in throughput could not always be attributed to a higher neuron firing rate, to more ongoing muscle activity, or to neuronal synchronization, indicating that reorganization of motor cortex output may involve rapid changes in functional connectivity from single motor cortex neurons to α-motoneuron pools."
https://openalex.org/W2043256370,"Gene expression profiling and the analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks may support the identification of disease bio-markers and potential drug targets. Thus, a step forward in the development of systems approaches to medicine is the integrative analysis of these data sources in specific pathological conditions. We report such an integrative bioinformatics analysis in human heart failure (HF). A global PPI network in HF was assembled, which by itself represents a useful compendium of the current status of human HF-relevant interactions. This provided the basis for the analysis of interaction connectivity patterns in relation to a HF gene expression data set.Relationships between the significance of the differentiation of gene expression and connectivity degrees in the PPI network were established. In addition, relationships between gene co-expression and PPI network connectivity were analysed. Highly-connected proteins are not necessarily encoded by genes significantly differentially expressed. Genes that are not significantly differentially expressed may encode proteins that exhibit diverse network connectivity patterns. Furthermore, genes that were not defined as significantly differentially expressed may encode proteins with many interacting partners. Genes encoding network hubs may exhibit weak co-expression with the genes encoding their interacting protein partners. We also found that hubs and superhubs display a significant diversity of co-expression patterns in comparison to peripheral nodes. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis established that highly-connected proteins are likely to be engaged in higher level GO biological process terms, while low-connectivity proteins tend to be engaged in more specific disease-related processes.This investigation supports the hypothesis that the integrative analysis of differential gene expression and PPI network analysis may facilitate a better understanding of functional roles and the identification of potential drug targets in human heart failure."

Mad and Bub proteins are recruited to unattached kinetochores, and generate diffusible anaphase inhibitors. Checkpoint models propose that Mad1 and Bub1 act as stable kinetochore-bound scaffolds, to enhance recruitment of Mad2 and Mad3/BubR1, but this remains untested for Bub1. Here, fission yeast FRAP experiments confirm that Bub1 stably binds kinetochores, and by tethering Bub1 to telomeres we demonstrate that it is sufficient to recruit anaphase inhibitors in a kinase-independent manner. We propose that the major checkpoint role for Bub1 is as a signalling scaffold."

The SR, by regulating the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c), plays a central role in Ca2+ signaling to contribute to activities such as gene expression, growth, contraction, and cell death (reviewed in Refs. 7Berridge M.J.

In determining the qualitative nature of the biological response, the structural arrangement of the SR through the cell may be instrumental in enabling different functions to occur and proceed from various regions of the cell. For example, the SR, as a series of multiple, separate Ca2+-storage elements, each with their own limited measure of Ca2+, may explain localized all-or-none responses in restricted regions of the cell, the graded release of Ca2+ from the SR in the “quantal” release process and the various sensitivities to IP3 measured throughout the cell (11Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J.

Yet, whether or not the SR exists as multiple separate Ca2+ storage units or as a single luminally continuous entity in which Ca2+ diffuses freely throughout, is unclear. Evidence for the existence of multiple Ca2+ storage units comes from the heterogeneity of the SR in its Ca2+ handling capacity in smooth muscle (1Devine C.E. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 52: 690-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 4Villa A. Podini P. Panzeri M.C. Soling H.D. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. J.

The SR near the center of the cells may be depleted less readily of its Ca2+ than that of peripherally located SR (1Devine C.E. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 52: 690-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and x-ray microprobe analysis revealed Ca2+-rich spots in the central and peripheral SR in portal vein and taenia coli (17Bond M.

Cell Tissue Res. 1974; 154: 357-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Calsequestrin was not uniformly distributed through the SR network but clustered preferentially at sites most often within the peripheral SR (4Villa A. Podini P. Panzeri M.C. Soling H.D. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These calsequestrin-rich elements of the SR were also enriched with IP3R (4Villa A. Podini P. Panzeri M.C. Soling H.D. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This evidence provides a morphological basis for the existence of various arrangements of Ca2+ release channels. The SR Ca2+ stores have been classified on the basis of the arrangement of IP3R and RyR and conflicting evidence exists regarding their number and receptor arrangement. To determine the organization of the SR Ca2+ stores, in native cells, the predominant experimental approach relies on functional data. The SR is depleted via one receptor (e.g. RyR) and whether or not Ca2+ is available to be released via the other receptor (e.g. IP3R) then determined. If exhaustion of the response arising from one receptor leaves the response of the other receptor largely unaffected, the two channels are suggested to be localized on two or more stores. Taking this experimental approach, a single store that contained both RyR and IP3R, has been proposed to exist based on the observation that depletion of the SR Ca2+ store by caffeine (which activates RyR) prevented IP3-mediated Ca2+ release (19Boittin F.X. Macrez N. Halet G. Mironneau J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C139-C151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bolton T.B. Lim S.P. J. Physiol. 1989; 409: 385-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Physiol. 1995; 484: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Janiak R. Wilson S.M. Montague S. Hume J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C22-C33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this result only indicates that IP3R and RyR access a common Ca2+ source. Multiple stores, each containing both receptors, may exist and such an arrangement would be fully compatible with the experimental observation. Indeed, in other studies, there may be separate stores for each receptor, i.e. one series of stores that express only RyR, another only IP3R. This view was derived from the observation that depletion of the RyR-sensitive store did not abolish agonist-evoked IP3-mediated Ca2+release and vice versa (23Jabr R.I. Toland H. Gelband C.H. Wang X.X. Hume J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Other more elaborate arrangements of SR Ca2+ stores are also proposed in various cell types (e.g. taenia coli, pulmonary artery, myometrium). One store may express RyR and IP3R and other stores, in the same cell, only IP3R (24Iino M. Kobayashi T. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 25Iino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Yamazawa T. Iino M. Endo M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This conclusion followed the finding that depletion of the IP3-sensitive store abolished caffeine-evoked Ca2+ release, whereas depletion of the caffeine-sensitive store did not abolish Ca2+ release via IP3R. In yet other cell types (mesenteric artery, colonic smooth muscle) one store may express both RyR and IP3R, whereas a second, in the same cell, only RyR (27Flynn E.R. Bradley K.N. Muir T.C. McCarron J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36411-36418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Baro I. Eisner D.A. J. Physiol. 1995; 482: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the existence of separate stores has come from studies on the response of each of the receptors to inhibitors of the SR Ca2+ pump. Ca2+ pump inhibitors, e.g. thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid, deplete SR Ca2+ stores. If both receptors exist on a single store, Ca2+ release from each receptor should be equally sensitive to the inhibitors. Differences in the sensitivity of caffeine and IP3-mediated Ca2+ release to pump inhibitors has been interpreted as evidence of the existence of separate stores for each receptor (22Janiak R. Wilson S.M. Montague S. Hume J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C22-C33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 30Tribe R.M. Borin M.L. Blaustein M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5908-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For example, the ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive store was not sensitive to thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid, whereas the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store was depleted by the Ca2+ pump inhibitors in arterial myocytes (22Janiak R. Wilson S.M. Montague S. Hume J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C22-C33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tribe R.M. Borin M.L. Blaustein M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5908-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The structural organization of the store is thus often inferred from the functional consequences of store activation with differences in IP3R and RyR sensitivity to pharmacological agents (e.g. ryanodine and thapsigargin) that deplete the SR used widely to separate the store into subcompartments. However, the relationship between the sensitivity of the SR to pharmacological activators and inhibitors of Ca2+ release and whether or not subcompartments exist is unclear. Regions of various sensitivities to inhibitors and activators may also arise from higher densities of channels, pumps, or luminal Ca2+-binding proteins in different areas of the SR without a requirement for the existence of subcompartments (31Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 369-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The persistent uncertainty of the structure of the SR has prompted the present study in intact single smooth muscle cells. The results show that the SR is a single luminally continuous entity that contains both IP3R and RyR and in which Ca2+ may diffuse freely throughout. However, partial depletion of the SR may result in the appearance of multiple stores for each receptor. This situation arises by the regulation of the opening of IP3R and RyR by the [Ca2+] within the SR. Male guinea pigs (500-700 g) were humanely killed by cervical dislocation followed by immediate exsanguination in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act UK 1986. A segment of intact distal colon (∼5 cm) was transferred to oxygenated (95% O2, 5%CO2) physiological saline solution composed of (mm): NaCl, 118.4; NaHCO3, 25; KCl, 4.7; NaH2PO4, 1.13; MgCl2, 1.3; CaCl2, 2.7; and glucose, 11 (pH 7.4). Following removal of the mucosa from the tissue, single smooth muscle cells, largely from circular muscle, were enzymatically dissociated (32McCarron J.G. Muir T.C. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were stored at 4 °C and used within 24 h of cell isolation. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20 ± 2 °C). Electrophysiology—Membrane currents were measured using conventional tight seal whole cell recording methods. The extracellular solution contained (mm): sodium glutamate, 80; NaCl, 40; tetraethylammonium chloride, 20; MgCl2, 1.1; CaCl2, 3; Hepes, 10; and glucose, 30 (pH 7.4 with NaOH). The pipette solution contained (mm): (Cs)2SO4, 85; CsCl, 20; MgCl2, 1; Hepes, 30; MgATP, 3; pyruvic acid, 2.5; malic acid, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1; creatine phosphate, 5; guanosine phosphate, 0.5; and caged IP3 trisodium salt, 0.025. Whole cell currents were measured using an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), low-pass filtered at 500 Hz (8-pole bessel filter; Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA), digitally sampled at 1.5 kHz using a Digidata interface and pClamp (version 8; Axon Instruments) and stored for analysis. In some experiments a second patch clamp electrode with modified extracellular solution (which contained 30 or 50 mm Ca2+) was used. The electrode was sealed “on-cell” in a “giga-seal” configuration to provide a localized Ca2+ source to the cell. Here, currents were measured using a second Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) and low-pass filtered at 500 Hz. The potential of the second on-cell electrode was 0 mV so that the entire cell, including the on “cell patch,” was maintained at membrane potential set by the whole cell electrode, i.e. patch transmembrane potential = Vwhole cell electrode - Vpatch electrode. Imaging—Cells were loaded with fluo-3 acetoxymethylester (AM) (10 μm) and wortmanin (10 μm; to prevent contraction) for at least 20 min prior to the beginning of the experiment. Two dimensional [Ca2+]c images were obtained using a wide-field digital imaging system (33McCarron J.G. MacMillan D. Bradley K.N. Chalmers S. Muir T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8417-8427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Single cells were illuminated at 488 nm (bandpass 14 nm) from a monochromator (Polychrome IV, T.I.L.L. Photonics, Martinsried, Germany) and imaged through an oil immersion objective (×40 UV 1.3 NA; Nikon UK, Surrey, United Kingdom). Excitation light was passed via a fiber optic guide through a 485-bandpass (15 nm) filter and a field stop diaphragm and reflected off a 505-nm long-pass dichroic mirror. Emitted light was guided through a 535-nm barrier filter (bandpass 45 nm) to an intensified, cooled, frame transfer CCD camera (Pentamax Gen IV, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) operating in “virtual chip” mode with program WinView32 (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). Full frame images (150 × 150 pixels), with a pixel size of 563 nm at the cell, were acquired at 20 or 100 frames s-1. Alternatively, to attain longer periods of data acquisition, the software program Metafluor (Molecular Devices Ltd., Wokingham, England) was used. Here the sampling was ∼10 frames s-1 during, and 1 frame s-1 between [Ca2+]c transients. Ca2+ imaging data were recorded on a personal computer. Electrophysiological measurements and imaging data were synchronized by recording, on pClamp, a transistor logic output from the CCD camera, which reported its readout status, together with the electrophysiological information. In those control experiments that involved the use BODIPY fluorescent ryanodine, [Ca2+]c was measured using fura-2 in a microfluorimeter system (34Kamishima T. McCarron J.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fura-2 was required in these experiments to avoid the overlap in fluorescence emitted from BODIPY and fluo-3. Briefly, [Ca2+]c was measured using membrane-impermeable fura-2 (potassium salt) introduced into the cell from the patch pipette. Fluorescence measurements were made using a microfluorimeter consisting of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon diaphot and a photomultiplier tube with a bi-alkali photocathode). The excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm, 7 nm bandpass) were provided by a PTI deltascan (Photon Technology International Inc., East Sheen, London, UK). [Ca2+]c measurements were made at a frequency of 10 Hz. The excitation light passed through a 425-nm short pass filter and a field stop diaphram used to reduce background fluorescence. A 400-nm long pass dichroic mirror reflected the excitation wavelengths onto the cell. A 570-nm short pass dichroic mirror passed the emission light through a 505-nm barrier filter onto the photomultiplier for photon counting. Longer wavelengths from bright field illumination with a 610-nm Shott glass filter were reflected onto a CCD camera (Sony model XC-75) mounted onto the viewing port of the deltascan allowing the cell to be monitored during the course of the experiments. In other experiments, the diffusion of ryanodine through the cell was tracked from the movement of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE) (1 μm). TMRE was applied to the cell together with ryanodine in a patch electrode sealed on the cell. TMRE fluorescence was measured together with that of the [Ca2+]c indicator fluo-4. Fluo-4 was used in these experiments because of the slight shift in its excitation spectrum when compared with that of fluo-3. This shift allowed a greater separation of the excitation wavelengths to be used for fluo-4 and TMRE (35Chalmers S. McCarron J.G. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TMRE has a comparable molecular mass (514.96 Da) to ryanodine (493.55 Da) and so presumably each share similar diffusion characteristics. Excitation light for TMRE and fluo-4 (560 and 475 nm, respectively) passed through a dual bandpass (483/553 nm) excitation filter (bandpass 15 and 20 nm, respectively) reflected off a dual long pass dichroic mirror (transmissive in the ranges 505-540 and 577-640 nm). Emitted light passed through a dual bandpass 518/594-nm barrier filter (bandpass 25 and 18 nm, respectively) before reaching the CCD camera (35Chalmers S. McCarron J.G. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Optical filters were purchased from Chroma (Rockingham, VT). Localized Flash Photolysis—The output of a xenon flashlamp (Rapp Optoelecktronic, Hamburg, Germany), used to uncage IP3, was passed though a UG-5 filter to select ultraviolet light, focused, and merged into the excitation light path via a fiber optic bundle and long pass dichroic mirror at the lens part of the microscope epi-illumination attachment. The fiber optics diameter together with the lens magnification determined the area (spot size ∼ 10 μm) of IP3 photolysis (33McCarron J.G. MacMillan D. Bradley K.N. Chalmers S. Muir T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8417-8427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The concentration of IP3 was altered to produce maximal and submaximal responses by changing the output of the xenon flashlamp. The output was reduced from ∼38 mJ (maximal) to ∼23 mJ (submaximal). In some figures the flash artifact has been blanked for clarity. Data Analysis—Images were analyzed using the program Metamorph 5.1 or 6.2r5 (Molecular Devices Ltd.). Fluorescence signals were expressed as ratios (F/F0 or ΔF/F0) of fluorescence counts (F) relative to base-line (control) values (taken as 1) before stimulation (F0). Original fluorescence recordings were not filtered, smoothed, or averaged. Summarized results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n cells. A paired or unpaired Student's t test was applied to the raw data as appropriate; p < 0.05 was considered significant. Drugs and Chemicals—Drugs were applied either by hydrostatic pressure ejection or addition to the extracellular solution as stated in the text. Concentrations in the text refer to the salts where appropriate. Fluo-3 and fluo-4 AM esters and TMRE were purchased from Invitrogen and caged Ins(1,4,5)P3-trisodium salt from SiChem GmbH (Bremen, Germany). Ryanodine was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Flash photolysis of caged IP3 (↑) and hydrostatic application of caffeine (10 mm) each increased [Ca2+]c (Fig. 1) in a voltage-clamped (membrane potential, -70 mV) single colonic smooth muscle cell by activating IP3R and RyR, respectively. The relationship between the two types of receptors on one or more SR Ca2+ stores was studied by first depleting the ryanodine-sensitive store of Ca2+ and the Ca2+ rise evoked by IP3 examined subsequently. In this tissue, ryanodine (50 μm) depletes the SR of Ca2+ via RyR after the channel has been activated, e.g. by caffeine (27Flynn E.R. Bradley K.N. Muir T.C. McCarron J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36411-36418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36MacMillan D. Chalmers S. Muir T.C. McCarron J.G. J.

If the receptors existed on a single structure to access a common Ca2+ store, depletion of the store via RyR should inhibit the Ca2+ rise mediated by IP3R. At -70 mV, IP3 evoked approximately reproducible increases in [Ca2+]c (1.1 ± 0.4 ΔF/F0; n = 6; Fig. 2) as did caffeine (1.3 ± 0.5 ΔF/F0; Fig. 2). In ryanodine (50 μm) IP3-evoked Ca2+ transients remained at 97 ± 16% of their control value (measured after four IP3-evoked Ca2+ transients); IP3-mediated Ca2+ release does not activate CICR at RyR in this tissue (36MacMillan D. Chalmers S. Muir T.C. McCarron J.G. J. Physiol. 2005; 569: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37McCarron J.G. Craig J.W. Bradley K.N. Muir T.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2207-2218PubMed Google Scholar). Caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transients, on the other hand, were inhibited to 10 ± 4% of controls by ryanodine (50 μm; 0.11 ± 0.04 ΔF/F0) after two caffeine applications. Significantly, after inhibition of the caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transient, the next IP3-evoked Ca2+ transient was reduced to 8 ± 3% of control values (0.13 ± 3 ΔF/F0; n = 6; Fig. 2). These results are compatible with IP3R existing on the same Ca2+ store as RyR; depleting the SR store via RyR reduces the Ca2+ available to be released via IP3R (27Flynn E.R. Bradley K.N. Muir T.C. McCarron J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36411-36418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36MacMillan D. Chalmers S. Muir T.C. McCarron J.G. J.

However, whereas the result suggests that IP3R accesses the same Ca2+ store as does RyR, it does not distinguish between the existence of single or multiple SR store elements each with both IP3R and RyR. To examine whether or not the IP3-sensitive store formed a continuum on the luminal aspect of the SR throughout the cell or existed as multiple separate elements there, one small (10 μm) area of the SR was depleted of Ca2+ by the repeated localized photolysis of caged IP3 in a Ca2+-free solution and the consequence of this depletion on the amount of Ca2+ available for release from the remainder of the SR measured (Fig. 3). If the SR comprised separate elements, depleting one small area of the SR should have little effect on the total amount of Ca2+ available for release elsewhere in the SR. In the event depletion at one site also depleted the entire SR of Ca2+, suggesting that the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store indeed existed as a single luminally continuous entity through which Ca2+ could diffuse freely (Fig. 3). Thus photolyzing caged IP3 at a 10-μm site at one end of the cell (Fig. 3, photolysis site 1) increased [Ca2+]c as revealed by the increase in the F/F0 ratio (Fig. 3; ΔIF/F0 1.96 ± 0.64; n = 6; p < 0.05). Subsequent (∼90 s later) photolysis of caged IP3 at a 10-μm site at the other end of the same cell (Fig. 3, photolysis site 2) also evoked reproducible increases in [Ca2+]c (ΔF/F0 1.54 ± 0.39; n = 6). Repeated application of IP3 at photolysis site 2 in a Ca2+-free solution depleted the SR of Ca2+ as revealed by the decrease in the [Ca2+]c transient measured at site 2 (ΔF/F0 0.15 ± 0.08; n = 6). Significantly, when the IP3-evoked Ca2+ transient had been reduced at photolysis site 2, the Ca2+ increase evoked by IP3 at photolysis site 1 was also reduced (ΔF/F0 0.1 ± 0.09; n = 6). Thus, releasing Ca2+ at one site of the SR reduced the amount of ion available for release from other distant sites. As a control, at the end of the experiment, Ca2+ was restored to the bathing solution and, under these conditions, IP3-evoked Ca2+ transients recovered (ΔF/F0 1.49 ± 0.54; n = 6). Diffusion of some IP3 to the end of the cell distant from the site of photolysis is unlikely to explain the depletion of the SR at the second site. The concentration of IP3 will decrease substantially with diffusion from the release site (into the larger volume of the cell) and by metabolism of the inositide. The peak [Ca2+]c rise decreased steeply with distance from the release site (Fig. 3C) and no increase could be measured at regions further than 60 μm from the release site. The latter value suggests that relatively little IP3 reached the second site that, in this cell, was 158 μm away. Moreover, the [Ca2+]c increase through the cell includes Ca2+, which had simply diffused from the release site. Nor is the decrease in IP3-evoked Ca2+ release a consequence of the Ca2+-free solution alone. Following a 7-min incubation in Ca2+-free solution (containing 3 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EGTA), without exposure to IP3, the first Ca2+ transient was 96 ± 7% of control (n = 3). The transient subsequently declined to 3 ± 1% (n = 3) of control on repetitive IP3 release. These results suggest that localized photolysis of caged IP3, in a small region of the cell, had depleted the entire SR of Ca2+. To confirm that the SR store was luminally continuous, the possibility that the entire SR could be refilled from one small site was investigated. Following depletion of the SR, by repeatedly applying IP3 to one small area of the cell in a Ca2+-free bathing solution, Ca2+ was readmitted but made available to only one site on the SR distant to the site of depletion (Fig. 4). The Ca2+ in a Ca2+-containing on cell patch electrode was the only available source of the ion for the entire cell. Under these conditions, the entire SR was found to have been replenished with Ca2+. This included the site previously depleted of Ca2+ despite the cell not having received any direct influx of the ion there (Fig. 4). Thus, in controls, the Ca2+ rise evoked by photolysis of caged IP3 was 1.1 ± 0.09 (ΔF/F0; n = 7). The [Ca2+]c rise decreased to 2 ± 1% (ΔF/F0 0.02 ± 0.01; n = 7) of control values in a Ca2+-free bathing solution. When the Ca2+ (30 or 50 mm) containing electrode was sealed onto the cell distant (92 ± 14 μm; n = 7) from the"
https://openalex.org/W1982840368,"The human genome harbors 5 remnant genes coding for vomeronasal type-1 receptors, compared with 187 of such receptors in mice. In rodents, vomeronasal type-1 receptors are typically expressed in the vomeronasal organ. They are believed to be highly selective and sensitive pheromone detectors, as may be inferred from one receptor, V1rb2, responding to picomolar concentrations of the mouse pheromone 2-heptanone. Expression patterns, ligands, and signal transduction of human vomeronasal type-1 receptors have, however, remained largely obscure. Our aim was to deorphan and functionally characterize these 5 putative human pheromone receptors. Here, we report functional expression for all 5 receptors in HeLa/Olf cells. The recombinant, N-terminally tagged receptors expressed at the plasma membrane of HeLa/Olf cells and responded differentially to 19 of 140 odorants in a combinatorial way. C9-C10 aliphatic alcohols or aldehydes emerged as the best agonists at submicromolar concentrations above human odorant thresholds. Surprisingly, and in contrast to mouse V1rb2, all human vomeronasal type-1 receptors activated cAMP signaling via G protein alphaolf, when expressed in HeLa/Olf cells. While a biological function of human vomeronasal type-1 receptors is still elusive, our data show that their major functional characteristics are similar to those of odorant receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1990494960,"The heat-stable enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (STa) is a potent stimulant of intestinal chloride and bicarbonate secretion. Guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) has been shown to be the primary receptor involved in mediating this response. However, numerous studies have suggested the existence of an alternative STa-binding receptor. The aims of this study were to determine whether a non-GC-C receptor exists for STa and what is the functional relevance of this for intestinal bicarbonate secretion in mice. (125)I-STa-binding experiments were performed with intestinal mucosae from GC-C knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice. Subsequently, the functional relevance of an alternative STa-binding receptor was explored by examining STa-, uroguanylin-, and guanylin-stimulated duodenal bicarbonate secretion (DBS) in GC-C KO mice in vitro and in vivo. Significant (125)I-STa-binding occurred in the proximal small intestines of GC-C KO and WT mice. Analysis of binding coefficients and pH dependence showed that (125)I-STa-binding in GC-C KO mice involved a receptor distinct from that of WT mice. Functionally, STa, uroguanylin, and guanylin all stimulated a significant increase in DBS in GC-C KO mice. Uroguanylin- and guanylin-stimulated DBS were significantly inhibited by glibenclamide, but not by 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS). However, STa-stimulated DBS was unaffected by glibenclamide but inhibited by DIDS. Taken together, our results suggest that alternative, non-GC-C, receptors likely exist for STa, uroguanylin, and guanylin in the intestines of mice. While uroguanylin- and guanylin-stimulated DBS are cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dependent, STa-stimulated DBS is CFTR independent. Further understanding of this alternative receptor and its signaling pathway may provide important insights into rectification of intestinal bicarbonate secretion in cystic fibrosis."

https://openalex.org/W2008042156,"Performance on most sensory tasks improves with practice. When making particularly challenging sensory judgments, perceptual improvements in performance are tightly coupled to the trained task and stimulus configuration. The form of this specificity is believed to provide a strong indication of which neurons are solving the task or encoding the learned stimulus. Here we systematically decouple task- and stimulus-mediated components of trained improvements in perceptual performance and show that neither provides an adequate description of the learning process. Twenty-four human subjects trained on a unique combination of task (three-element alignment or bisection) and stimulus configuration (vertical or horizontal orientation). Before and after training, we measured subjects' performance on all four task-configuration combinations. What we demonstrate for the first time is that learning does actually transfer across both task and configuration provided there is a common spatial axis to the judgment. The critical factor underlying the transfer of learning effects is not the task or stimulus arrangements themselves, but rather the recruitment of commons sets of neurons most informative for making each perceptual judgment."

The luminal/extracellular N terminus contains a helix-rich sterile α-motif in addition to an EF-hand Ca2+ sensor (6Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Williams R.T. Senior P.V. Van Stekelenburg L. Layton J.E. Smith P.J. Dziadek M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic C terminus contains two prominent coiled-coil regions followed by a flexible proline-rich domain (6Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Williams R.T. Senior P.V. Van Stekelenburg L. Layton J.E. Smith P.J. Dziadek M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Based on the protein structure and several studies on STIM1, we hypothesize that two distinct types of interactions are likely important in the function of STIM1. First, homotypic interactions likely mediate the aggregation of the molecule into puncta after Ca2+ store depletion (19Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Plevin M.J. Ames J.B. Ikura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35855-35862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that an N-terminal fragment of STIM1 that contains the sterile α-motif and the EF-hand domains is able to undergo self-association upon removal of Ca2+ (19Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Plevin M.J. Ames J.B. Ikura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35855-35862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the ER luminal N terminus of STIM1 mediates the punctal self-assembly of STIM1 when the ER Ca2+ is depleted. Second, the “punctal” STIM1, which lies within ∼25 nm of the PM (5Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell J.E. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1235-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 17Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), likely interacts directly with components in the PM, through its cytosolic domain. The latter can be achieved through homotypic interactions between the ER-bound STIM1 (STIM1-ER) and the PM-bound STIM1 (STIM1-PM). Earlier studies revealed that the coiled-coil region of STIM1 is indeed involved in homotypic interactions between STIM1 molecules (18Williams R.T. Senior P.V. Van Stekelenburg L. Layton J.E. Smith P.J. Dziadek M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Alternatively STIM1-ER might be interacting with other PM protein or directly with the pore-forming protein Orai1. We consider the later less likely, based on a recent study that showed a lack of detectable interaction between STIM1 and Orai1 (20Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Feske S. Cruz-Guilloty F. Oh-Hora M. Neems D.S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16232-16243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Furthermore, biochemical cross-linking of the ER with the PM revealed that the distance between the ER and the PM at the sites of STIM1 puncta is too large (11–14 nm) for direct interactions of STIM1-ER with the PM Orai1 (21Varnai P. Toth B. Toth D.J. Hunyady L. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29678-29690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). That, however, is not the case for putative STIM1-ER and STIM1-PM interactions; hence the first coiled-coil region of STIM1 is an approximately 8-nm-long α-helix containing 15 turns (6Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and can provide the structural means for ER-PM interactions during CRAC activation. The possibility that this cytosolic segment of STIM1 is essential for bridging the ER with the PM to activate CRAC channel was explored in the present study. Our data reveal that the intact structure of the first coiled-coil domain of STIM1 protein is crucial for the CRAC channel activation. Orai1 is an integral membrane protein that works in synergy with STIM1 to reconstitute CRAC channel function (8Peinelt C. Vig M. Koomoa D.L. Beck A. Nadler M.J. Koblan-Huberson M. Lis A. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 9Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Tang X.D. Hewavitharana T. Xu W. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20661-20665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In resting cells, Orai1 is diffusely distributed in the PM, but following store depletion it migrates to areas in close proximity to the near-PM STIM1 puncta, where local Ca2+ entry occurs (22Luik R.M. Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Orai1 has four predicted transmembrane domains (TM), a topology similar to the KCNK two pore domains K+ channels (23Talley E.M. Sirois J.E. Lei Q. Bayliss D.A. Neuroscientist. 2003; 9: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The putative TM1-TM2 extracellular loop of human Orai1 contains a number of acidic residues, and the first one, Glu106, is the most conserved across species. Several groups simultaneously identified Glu106 (Glu180 in Drosophila) as a residue that coordinates the Ca2+ binding to the selectivity filter of the CRAC channel (24Yeromin A.V. Zhang S.L. Jiang W. Yu Y. Safrina O. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2006; 443: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 25Prakriya M. Feske S. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Nature. 2006; 443: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). 3M. Spassova, unpublished observations. These experiments were repeated by another group using our Orai1E106D construct (26Vig M. Beck A. Billingsley J.M. Lis A. Parvez S. Peinelt C. Koomoa D.L. Soboloff J. Gill D.L. Fleig A. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2073-2079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). All these results provided unequivocal evidence that Orai1 is a pore-forming subunit of the CRAC channel. In the present study we further examined the function of this residue and adjacent residues by structure-function analysis. Uniquely, our study was conducted on cells in which endogenous STIM1 and Orai1 proteins were knocked down, with a background overexpression of the constitutively active STIM1 EF-hand double mutant D76A/E87A. Under this condition, expression of Orai1 resulted in massive constitutive CRAC channel activity allowing a precise evaluation of the function of Orai1 and mutants thereof. In addition, using the constitutively active STIM1 protein, we could examine the channel properties independent of store emptying and the effects of Ca2+ release from the ER. We examined the properties of the CRAC channel selectivity for monovalent and divalent cations and demonstrated that expression of the nonselective E106D mutant results in a CRAC channel with preserved inward rectification in divalent cation-free solution (DVF), suggesting an intrinsic voltage gating of CRAC channel. Mg2+ and polyamines are known to induce inward rectification in K+ channels by voltage-dependent block (27Guo D. Lu Z. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28Spassova M. Lu Z. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Lu Z. MacKinnon R. Nature. 1994; 371: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis of the presence of intrinsic voltage gating is further supported by the lack of effect of intracellular Mg2+ and polyamines on the endogenous CRAC channel conductance (30Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Hermosura M.C. Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Here we further demonstrate that mutation of the Val102 residue of Orai1, close to the selectivity filter-defining Glu106 residue, results in a time-resolved voltage gating of the CRAC channel. This voltage gating was not affected by the ionic composition of the extracellular solution that is further consistent with an intrinsic mechanism. Cells, Cell Culture, and Reagents—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. RBL cells were grown in the same medium but with heat-inactivated serum. ATP and G418 were from Sigma. Thapsigargin was from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Stealth siRNA duplexes for rat STIM1 and rat Orai1 were from Invitrogen. Enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) vector was from BD Biosciences (Mountain View, Ca). RNA Interference Design and RNA Interference/DNA Transfection—All siRNA sequences were designed using Invitrogen Block-It software. A mixture of two siRNA duplex sequences exclusively targeting rat and not human STIM1 were used with start nucleotides 935 and 970. Two rat-specific siRNA targeting different regions of rat Orai1 and not human Orai1 were used for Orai1 knockdown with start nucleotides 488 and 837. Scrambled double-stranded RNA sequences were used as negative control. Transfections were performed by electroporation using the Gene Pulser II Electroporation system (Bio-Rad) at 350 V, 960 microfarads, and infinite resistance. Transfection with siRNA was followed by co-transfection with the indicated DNA expression constructs and YFP after 24 h. After 48 h the cells were selected by YFP fluorescence for recordings as previously described (6Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In some cases the cells were transfected with one of two transfection reagents (FuGENE 6, Roche Applied Science; or Lipofectamine, Invitrogen) with 2–3 μg of DNA, ∼24 h after plating in 35-mm dishes of 250,000 cells. DNA Expression Constructs and Mutagenesis—Wild type human STIM1 (STIM1WT) was subcloned into pIRESneo (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as previously described (18Williams R.T. Senior P.V.

Orai1, expressed in pCMV6-XL4, was obtained from Origene (Rockville, MD). YFP conjugated to the N terminus of STIM1 and STIM1D76A constructs were gifts from Dr. Tobias Meyer. The human STIM1 and Orai1 mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Immunoblot Analysis of Protein Expression—The cells were grown in 35-mm dishes and harvested 48 h after transfection as previously described (33Patel K.A. Bartoli K.M. Fandino R.A. Ngatchou A.N. Woch G. Carey J. Tanaka J.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay. The samples were retained on ice, mixed with prewarmed 2× loading buffer and immediately loaded onto the gel. Standard SDS-PAGE and transfer buffers were used for running the gel and for transferring the gel to a 0.45-μm pore nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) at ∼70 mA. The membrane was blocked in 5% dry milk in washing buffer containing Tween (0.05%) and Tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight with primary anti-green fluorescent protein antibody at 1:3000 dilution (Sigma-Aldrich). The membrane was washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (LumiGlo, Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY). Fluorescence Localization and Immunocytochemistry—To characterize the fluorescence distribution of the YFP-STIM1, YFP-STIM1D76A, and YFP-STIM1L286P/L292P proteins, the cells grown on coverslips were fixed 48 h after transfection, with or without 20 min stimulation by thapsigargin, using 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell imaging was performed using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS-NT). Electrophysiology—We used conventional whole cell recordings as described previously (6Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The cells were transferred into the recording chamber on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips prior to experiments and allowed to settle. Immediately after establishing the whole cell configuration, linear voltage ramps of 50-ms duration spanning the voltage range of –100 to +100 mV were delivered from a holding potential of 0 mV at a rate of 0.5 Hz, in some cases preceded by a prestep to various voltages as described in the text. The currents were filtered at 6 kHz and sampled at 10–50-μs intervals. We used automatic capacitive and series resistance compensation of the EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA). PatchMaster, Pulsetools, FitMaster, and Origin software were used for acquisition and analysis. The temporal development of inward (at –80 mV) and outward (at +80 mV) currents were measured from the individual ramps. The intracellular solution contained 145 mm CsGlu, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm BAPTA, 8 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2mm Mg2ATP (8 mm Mg2+ total), pH 7.2. The excess 8 mm Mg2+ and ATP were used to ensure the inhibition of the endogenous TRPM7 channels (31Hermosura M.C. Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 34Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 487-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The extracellular solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 10 mm CsCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with 2 mm EDTA added to form the DVF. 2 mm Mg2+ with 1 or 10 mm Ca2+ were added as indicated. The 20 and 30 mm Ca2+ solutions were prepared with addition of the appropriate amount of 120 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 solution and the addition of MgCl2 to 2 mm Mg2+ final concentration. Na+ was replaced by NMDG+ in some experiments as indicated. We applied a 10-mV junction potential compensation as described for solutions with similar composition (35Neher E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). In some cases we used a glutamate-based external solution 130 mm CsGlu, 20 mm CaGlu2, 2mm MgCl2, 10mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the corresponding DVF containing 160 mm NaGlu, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. These solutions did not give different results from the Cl–-based solutions. All current-voltage (I/V) relationships were filtered off-line at 1 kHz. The I/V curves in DVF were derived from the current ramp at the time of maximum activation defined from the current time dependence at –80 mV. All I/V curves recorded in Ca2+ are shown at the time of maximum activation. The currents after channel inactivation in DVF or block by 5 μm 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate or Gd3+ were used for leak subtraction. In some cases control cells with STIM1 and Orai1 knockdown were used for leak subtraction. The maximal CRAC currents at –100 mV after leak subtraction were used for statistical analysis. Each statistical bar plot is an average of three or more experiments. The stars on the bar plots represent significant difference from control (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.005). When referring to CRAC channel activity that is measured in cells co-expressing STIM1D76A/E87A and Orai1X mutants on a combined knockdown background of rOrai1 and rSTIM1, we refer to it as “Orai1X-CRAC channel” activity. The cells with transient expression of STIM1D76A/E87A when co-expressed with Orai1 or its mutants were healthy for recordings within 48 h after the transfection. Ca2+Measurement—HEK cells grown on coverslips were placed in “cation safe” medium free of sulfate and phosphate anions (107 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11.5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2) and loaded with fura-2/acetoxymethylester (2 μm) for 30 min at 20 °C. The cells were washed, and dye was allowed to de-esterify for a minimum of 30 min at 20 °C. The cells on coverslips were placed in cation safe medium in the absence or presence of 1 mm CaCl2. Ca2+ measurements were performed using an InCyt dual wavelength fluorescence imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc.). Fluorescence emission at 505 nm was monitored with excitation at 340 and 380 nm; intracellular Ca2+ measurements are shown as 340/380-nm ratios. Ca2+ entry through CRAC channel was induced by incubation with 2 μm thapsigargin. All traces are averages from multiple cells and are representative of at least three separate experiments. Introduction of a Kink in the First STIM1 Coiled-coil α-Helix Prevents the CRAC Channel Activation—The STIM1 protein is a Ca2+ sensor in the ER that transmits information to the PM to activate the CRAC channels when ER Ca2+ is depleted (5Liou J.

Stauderman K.A. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Following store depletion, STIM1 aggregates into “punctal” regions of ER that lie within ∼25 nm of the PM (17Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 22Luik R.M. Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Interaction with the PM proteins is likely through the large C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of STIM1, which includes two extended coiled-coil regions and a less structured proline-rich region (6Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that deletion of the proline-rich region of STIM1 still permits CRAC channel activation (6Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Here we address the role of the coiled-coil region of STIM1, in coupling of the ER with the PM to activate the CRAC channel. We expressed human STIM1WT and mutants thereof on a rat STIM1 knockdown background in RBL cells, as we undertook previously (6Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We introduced a kink in the first, unusually long coiled-coil region of STIM1 by substituting two close leucine residues with prolines to perturb the α-helical structure. Expression of the single STIM1L292P mutation did not result in significant change in CRAC channel current amplitudes compared with the STIM1WT-expressing cells. However, expression of the double mutant STIM1L286P/L292P dramatically reduced the amplitude of ICRAC measured at its maximum activation in DVF (Fig. 1A). On average the current was decreased by 85% in cells expressing the mutated STIM1 compared with the STIM1WT (Fig. 1A, right panel). We also compared the ability of STIM1WT and STIM1L286P/L292P to increase CRAC-mediated Ca2+ entry in HEK293 cells using intracellular Ca2+ imaging (Fig. 1B). Co-overexpression of STIM1 and Orai1 resulted in a large increase of CRAC-mediated Ca2+ entry (Fig. 1B). However, when STIM1L286P/L292P was co-expressed with Orai1, the r"

Here we identified microorganisms that assimilate hydrazones and isolated the yeast, Candida palmioleophila MK883.

Cytosolic NAD+- or NADP+-dependent hydrazone dehydrogenase (Hdh) activity was detectable under these conditions. The production of Hdh was inducible by adipic acid bis(ethylidene hydrazide) and the hydrazone, varelic acid ethylidene hydrazide, under the control of carbon catabolite repression. Purified Hdh oxidized and hydrated the C=N double bond of acetaldehyde hydrazones by reducing NAD+ or NADP+ to produce relevant hydrazides and acetate, the latter of which the yeast assimilated. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that Hdh belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh) superfamily. Kinetic and mutagenesis studies showed that Hdh formed a ternary complex with the substrates and that conserved Cys is essential for the activity. The mechanism of Hdh is similar to that of Aldh, except that it catalyzed oxidative hydrolysis of hydrazones that requires adding a water molecule to the reaction catalyzed by conventional Aldh. Surprisingly, both Hdh and Aldh from baker's yeast (Ald4p) catalyzed the Hdh reaction as well as aldehyde oxidation.

Hydrazides are derivatives of acids in which a hydroxyl residue is substituted with a hydrazino (-NR1-NR2R3) group. Acyl derivatives of hydrazide, such as isonicotinic acid hydrazide and its related compounds, are antituberculosis reagents, and some of them are also antidepressants (1Kennedy S.H. J. Psychiatry Neurosci. 1997; 22: 127-131PubMed Google Scholar). Among the naturally occurring hydrazides, agaritine, a phenyl derivative of hydrazide found in the commercial mushroom Agaricus bisporus, might have carcinogenic activity (2Toth B. Nagel D. Patil K. Erickson J. Antonson K. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 177-180PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrazide derivatives that lack substitutions on one of the nitrogen atoms (R1R2N-NH2) possess a highly active -N-NH2 moiety and easily react with the carbonyl groups of various compounds to produce hydrazones, which can be described as in Reaction 1. R1R2N-NH2 + C(=O)R3R4 → R1R2N-N=CR3R4 + H2OREACTION 1 This hydrazone-forming reaction is essentially a condensation reaction of the hydrazides and the carbonyl compounds. This reaction is used for synthesizing versatile compounds, including pharmaceuticals, dyes, agrochemicals, and other organic compounds (3Rothgery E.F. Kirk-Othmer Encyclop. Chem. Technol. 2004; 13: 562-607Google Scholar). Hydrazones are also distributed in nature. One example is the hemolytic toxin, gyromitrin (acetaldehyde methylformylhydrazone), which is produced by false morel mushrooms (4Michelot D. J. Toxicol. Clin. Exp. 1989; 9: 83-99PubMed Google Scholar), and an alkaloid-containing hydrazone has been isolated from a marine sponge (5Shimogawa H. Kuribayashi S. Teruya T. Suenaga K. Kigoshi H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2006; 47: 1409-1411Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, their physiological functions and biosynthetic mechanisms are unknown. Despite their chemical and biological importance, few biological systems metabolize hydrazides and hydrazones. The liver might metabolize isonicotinic acid hydrazide to isonicotinic acid through cytochrome P450 (6Ono Y. Wu X. Noda A. Noda H. Yoshitani T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1998; 21: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and amidase (7Sarich T.C. Adams S.P. Petricca G. Wright J.M.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 695-702PubMed Google Scholar) activities, but the enzymes that catalyze this reaction remain obscure. Earlier reports have shown that an actinomycete bacterium produces hydrazidase that hydrolyzes isonicotinic acid hydrazide and its derivatives (8Toida I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1963; 53: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Agaritine γ-glutamyltransferase (EC 2.3.2.9) has been partially purified and is proposed as the enzyme responsible for the esterification of γ-glutamyl carboxylate to p-hydroxymethylphenylhydrazine to form agaritine (9Gigliotti H.J. Levenberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2274-2284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these enzymes attack or form acyl hydrazides, little is known about those that attack the double bond of the N-N=C hydrazone groups. To our knowledge, peptidylglycine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.17.3) (10Bradbury A.F. Smyth D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and glutamine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.15) (11Cooper A.J.L. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8489-8498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are the only known enzymes that react with hydrazones. However, hydrazones are not their physiological substrates, and thus, how biological systems utilize hydrazones remains obscure. Here we chemically synthesized hydrazone compounds (adipic acid bis(ethylidene hydrazide) (AEH), 2The abbreviations used are:AEHadipic acid bis(ethylidene hydrazide)AAHadipic acid bis(2-acetyl hydrazine)ADHadipic acid dihydrazideAldhaldehyde dehydrogenaseAMHadipic acid ethylidene hydrazideDTTdithiothreitolHdhhydrazone dehydrogenaseVAHvarelic acid acetyl hydrazineVEHvarelic acid ethylidene hydrazideVHvarelic acid hydrazideP5CΔ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylateRACErapid amplification of cDNA endspNPp-nitrophenyl. and varelic acid ethylidene hydrazide (VEH)) (Fig. 1A), isolated the yeast that assimilates them from soil, and purified an enzyme that degrades hydrazones. The enzyme attacked the C=N double bond of hydrazones and catalyzed NAD+-dependent oxidation and hydration to produce the relevant hydrazide and acid. This “oxidative hydrolysis” reaction is unique among known enzymes. We also found that the enzyme belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh) superfamily. The present study is the first to uncover a mechanism for hydrazone assimilation in biological systems and a novel role of an enzyme in the ALDH superfamily, namely cleavage of the C=N double bond. adipic acid bis(ethylidene hydrazide) adipic acid bis(2-acetyl hydrazine) adipic acid dihydrazide aldehyde dehydrogenase adipic acid ethylidene hydrazide dithiothreitol hydrazone dehydrogenase varelic acid acetyl hydrazine varelic acid ethylidene hydrazide varelic acid hydrazide Δ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate rapid amplification of cDNA ends p-nitrophenyl. Reagents—The hydrazones in Fig. 1 were prepared and identified as described in the supplemental information. Purity (<96%) was confirmed by NMR. All other reagents were of biochemical analysis grade. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ald4p was obtained from Sigma (cat. no. A9770). Strains, Culture, and Media—We isolated strain MK883 from soil after screening in carbon-limited minimal (MM) medium (10 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.05% MgSO4, 0.05% KCl, 0.2% Hunter's trace element solution (12Barratt R.W. Johnson G.B. Ogata W.N. Genetics. 1965; 52: 233-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) containing 30 mm AEH (MMAEH medium), and Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl). We analyzed the effects of the carbon source by replacing 30 mm AEH with appropriate carbon sources. C. palmioleophila NBRC70761 and other type strains were obtained from the Biological Resource Center, National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, Japan unless otherwise stated and maintained in YMPD medium (0.3% yeast extract, 0.3% malt extract, 0.5% peptone, 1% glucose). Screening of Hydrazone-degrading Microorganisms—Soil samples were suspended in 5 ml of MMAEH medium in test tubes and shaken (120 rpm) at 30 °C for 48 h. Fresh MMAEH medium was inoculated with 0.1 ml of the culture and incubated under the same conditions. These steps were repeated twice. The resulting suspension was streaked on LB plates and incubated at 30 °C. Bacterial and yeast colonies that appeared on the plates were transferred to 5 ml of MM medium containing 30 mm sodium succinate or LB medium, incubated at 30 °C for 24 h, and 1 ml was inoculated into 100 ml of MMAEH medium. After shaking (120 rpm) at 30 °C for 20 h, cells were collected by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm, suspended in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm EDTA), and disrupted by ultra-sonication (Sonifier 250, Branson). Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to remove debris and used for enzyme assays. Strains with high levels of enzyme activities were selected. Enzyme Assays—Hydrazone dehydrogenase activity was measured using the following assay systems. Method A: The reaction mixture comprised 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 5 mm AEH or VEH, 5 mm NAD+, and 1 mm DTT (100 μl of total volume), and the reaction was started by adding enzyme. After incubation at 30 °C for 15-120 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of cold acetonitrile, and the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The AEH remaining in the supernatant was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography as described below. Method B: The reaction mixture used in Method A was placed in an optical cell, and the reaction was started by adding enzyme. Increases in NADH were followed by monitoring absorbance at 340 nm at 25 °C using a DU-7500 spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter). The molecular coefficient of 6.22 mm-1 cm-1 was used for NADH. Hydrolyzing activity of p-nitrophenyl acetate was measured in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), 3 mm pNP acetate, 1 mm DTT and an appropriate amount of enzyme. Reactions proceeded at 30 °C for 20 min, and then the mixtures were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, and p-nitrophenol was measured as absorbance at 405 nm. The molecular coefficient of 1.71 × 104 m-1 cm-1 was used for p-nitrophenol. Aldh activity was measured by Method B except that the reaction mixture comprised 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate/potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 9.0), 0.025 mm acetaldehyde, 1 mm NAD+, 1 mm DTT. The activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase were assayed as described previously (13Hankinson O. Cove D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2344-2353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cooperstein S.J. Lazarow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 189: 665-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined using Protein Assay Kits (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Analytical Methods—Levels of AEH, AMH, and ADH were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HP-1100, Hewlett-Packard) equipped with a TSKgel ODS-80™ column (4.6 × 150 mm, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and by monitoring absorption at 210 nm. The mobile-phase solvent system comprised 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2): acetonitrile (9:1, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min-1. We separated VEH and VH using 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2):acetonitrile (8:2, v/v) as a solvent. Acetate was determined by suppressor anion chromatography (Model 761, Compact IC, Metrohm, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purification of Hydrazone Dehydrogenase—C. palmioleophila MK883 was incubated in 200 ml of LB medium at 30 °C for 15 h. Cells were collected after centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min, transferred to MMAEH medium, incubated at 30 °C for 20 h, and collected by centrifugation as above. Typically, 20 g of cells (wet weight) obtained from 20 liters of culture was suspended in buffer A and homogenized with aluminum oxide. The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a column containing DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman International Ltd., UK) equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted from the column with 300 ml of buffer A at a flow rate of 0.8 ml min-1. Fractions with hydrazone dehydrogenase activity were pooled and applied to a column containing hydroxyapatite (Wako Pure Chemical Ind. Ltd., Japan) equilibrated with buffer A and then eluted with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate (0-0.5 m) in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. Each of these steps proceeded at 4 °C. Fractions containing hydrazone dehydrogenase activity were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA) for 16 h, and then applied to Resource Q columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (0-0.5 m) in buffer B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. Fractions containing hydrazone dehydrogenase were applied to a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. Fractions containing hydrazone dehydrogenase activity were pooled and used as the purified preparation. Characterization of Hydrazone Dehydrogenase—The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was determined by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) or by gel filtration chromatography using Superose 6 10/300 GL (Amersham Biosciences) as above. The effects of inhibitors and metal ions (1 mm each) on the enzyme activity were examined after the enzyme (1 μg) was incubated with each reagent in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) for 1 h at room temperature. Steady-state turnover of hydrazone dehydrogenase activity was measured using Method B. Purified protein (1 μg) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then proteins were electronically blotted onto a polyvinylpyrrolidone membrane. Blots were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, protein bands were excised, and the N-terminal amino acids were determined using an automated protein sequencer (Model Precise 492, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cloning and Nucleotide Sequencing—Total DNA of the strain MK883 served as the template for PCR with the degenerate oligonucleotide primers FA, FB, FC, and FD (supplemental Table S1). The first PCR included 200 pm primers FA and FB and 0.5 μg of total DNA as the template with denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 42 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The second PCR proceeded using the product of the first PCR as the template and FC and FD as the primers under the same conditions. Complementary DNA was synthesized using 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) version 2.0, and 3′-RACE systems (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was prepared from the strain MK883 cultured in MMAEH medium for 24 h as above. The gene-specific primers for 5′-RACE were GSP1 and GSP2, and those for 3′-RACE were GSP3 and GSP4 (supplemental Table S1). The products were cloned into pGEM®-T easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The D1/D2 region of the gene encoding 26 S rRNA (16Reynolds D.R. Taylor J.W. Reynolds D.R. Taylor J.W. The Fungal Holomorph: Mitotic, Meiotic and Pleomorphic Speciation in Fungal Systematic. CAB International, Wallingford1993: 225-233Google Scholar), 1.7 kbp of 18 S rRNA (17Medlin L. Elwood H.J. Stickel S. Sogin M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 71: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar), and 1.4 kbp of 16 S rRNA (18Delong E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5685-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2247) Google Scholar) were isolated as described previously. Nucleotide sequences were determined by using an automated DNA sequencer (CEQ2000, Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotide sequences will appear in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ nucleotide data base under accession numbers AB361432 (Hdh), AB361594 (26 S rRNA of MK883), AB361592, AB361593 (18 S rRNA of C. palmioleophila and Williopsis saturnus), AB361588, AB361589, AB361590, and AB361591 (16 S rRNA of Pseudomonas putida, Delftia acidovorans, Bacillus flexus, and P. aeruginosa). Steady-state Kinetics—Kinetic constants for hydrazone dehydrogenase activity were assessed using data obtained with variable concentrations of one compound at a fixed concentration (1 mm) of another. Apparent Km values for AEH and NAD(P)+ were determined by fitting each dataset to Equation 1. v/e=kcat[A]/(KA+[A]) Dehydrogenase activity for VEH was assayed with varied concentrations of VEH at fixed concentrations of NAD(P)+. Assuming that the reaction mechanism was sequential (Fig. 5), the data were analyzed by non-linear regression (Origin ver. 6, OriginLab) after fitting the data to Equation 2 and determining KiB from KiB = (KiA KB)/KA. v/e=kcat[A][B]/(KiAKB+KA[B]+KB[A]+[A][B]) Data obtained from pNP acetate hydrolase inhibition by VEH and NAD+ were fitted to Equation 3 for competitive inhibition or Equation 4 for mixed inhibition, respectively. v/e=kcat[A]/(KA(1+[I]/Ki)+[A]) v/e=kcat[A]/(KA(1+[I]/Ki)+[A][I]KA/KiKA') In Equations 1-4, v = initial velocity, and e, [A], [B], and [I] are the concentrations of enzyme, substrates A and B, and inhibitor. KA and KB are the Michaelis-Menten constants of substrates A and B. KiA and KiB are the dissociation constant for substrates A and B. Ki is the inhibition constant. KA′ is the dissociation constant for the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex. Preparation of Recombinant Hdh—For producing wild-type Hdh with a 6× His tag on the amino terminus, the cDNA of Hdh was amplified by PCR using the primers HF and HR (supplemental Table S1), digested with NdeI and XhoI, and cloned into pET15b (Novagen, Germany). The plasmid was then digested using the same enzymes. The resultant plasmid (pET15hdh1) was introduced into Escherichia coli Rosetta gami B (DE3). Plasmids for producing the mutant Hdh were constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) using the primers CSF1 and CSR1 for C301S mutant, and EAF1 and EAR1 for E267A mutant (supplemental Table S1). The E. coli strain was cultured at 120 rpm and 37 °C for 12 h in LB medium containing 50 μgl-1 sodium ampicillin (LA medium), and then 10 ml was transferred to 100 ml of LA medium. After incubating for 2 h at 37 °C, 0.1 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside was added to the culture. Incubation was continued for additional 8 h at 50 rpm and 25 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 min, suspended in buffer A, ultrasonicated, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min to remove cell debris. The resultant cell-free extract was applied to a chelating Sepharose column (φ 1 × 2 cm) and equilibrated with buffer C (buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl). Bound proteins were eluted with buffer C containing 500 mm imidazole. Resultant fractions were dialyzed against buffer A, and analyzed. Quantitative PCR—Total RNA of the strain MK883 was extracted from cells cultured in MMAEH, and MM media containing 200 mm glucose, 30 mm sodium succinate, and both 30 mm AEH and 200 mm glucose as the sole carbon source at 30 °C for 20 h. First strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating total RNA (2.3 μg) in 10 μl of reaction buffer comprising Oligo(dT)20 (Toyobo Co., Ltd, Japan), 5× reverse transcriptase buffer, and reverse transcriptase Moloney murine leukemia virus (200 units, Takara Bio, Inc.) at 42 °C for 90 min. First strand cDNA (1 μl) synthesized in this reaction was amplified by quantitative PCR using iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and MiniOpticon™ version 3.1 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of Hdh was normalized against that of 18 S rRNA. Data were calculated as relative expression (20Thellin O. Zorzi W. Lakaye B. De Borman B. Coumans B. Hennen G. Grisar T. Igout A. Heinen E. J. Biotechnol. 1999; 75: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). The primers were HRF and HRR for Hdh, and 18RF and 18RR for 18 S rRNA (supplemental Table S1). Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—C. palmioleophila MK883 cells were cultured in 300 ml of MMAEH medium at 30 °C for 20 h and collected by centrifugation as described above. Cells were suspended in buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.4) containing Zymolyase 20-T (Seikagaku Co., Japan), and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min, and washed with the same buffer. The resulting protoplasts were lysed with buffer (0.25 m sorbitol, 20 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.4). The supernatant recovered after removal of cell debris (at 3,000 × g for 5 min) was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant and precipitates suspended in the same buffer were used as cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction. Isolation and Identification of Novel Hydrazone-assimilating Microorganisms—Before screening microorganisms that assimilate hydrazone, we chemically synthesized the hydrazone compound, AEH (Fig. 1A, 3), as described in the supplemental information, because insufficient amounts of hydrazone are commercially available for our screening. Coupling the two hydrazide groups of ADH (1) and acetaldehyde generated AEH with two hydrazone groups. We also prepared adipic acid ethylidene hydrazide (AMH) (2), which is derived from ADH when one hydrazide group remains unreacted with acetaldehyde. By enriching cultures in medium containing 30 mm AEH as the sole source of carbon (MMAEH medium), we screened 128 soil samples and isolated 82 microorganisms that grow by utilizing AEH as a carbon source. Seven strains expressed high levels of cell-free AEH-degrading activity (0.035-1.86 nmol min-1 mg-1). The reaction produced AMH and ADH, indicating that the isolates reacted against the C=N double bonds of both the hydrazone moieties of AEH. We selected one of the strains, MK883, that rapidly proliferated and produced the most AEH-degrading activity for further analysis. Strain MK883 was cultured in MMAEH medium (Fig. 2A). At the initial stage of the culture (∼15 h), AEH concomitantly decreased with increasing AMH and ADH. Further culture (15-23 h) decreased the accumulated AMH and increased ADH, indicating that MK883 metabolized AEH to AMH, and AMH to ADH. The reaction was stoichiometric regarding the amounts of AEH, AMH, and ADH, which also supported the reaction scheme 4 in Fig. 1B. The optical density of the culture was increased as AEH was consumed, indicating that AEH degradation conferred an increase in cell mass. Strain MK883 degraded the hydrazone, VEH (see Fig. 1A, 5, and supplemental information) to produce VH (Fig. 2B). Because no carbon source other than AEH or VEH was included in the culture medium, these results indicated that strain MK883 metabolized the hydrazones (AEH and VEH) as both carbon and energy sources. The nucleotide sequence for the D1/D2 region of the 26 S rRNA-coding gene of strain MK883 precisely matched that of C. palmioleophila NRRL Y-17323T (accession number U45758) and C. palmioleophila (strain name unspecified) (DQ234655). Strain MK883 had the morphology of a budding yeast and formed pseudohyphae during vegetative growth. No sexual reproductive organs were formed within 30 days of incubation. Strain MK883 did not ferment glucose and grew aerobically with any of glucose, galactose, sucrose, maltose, trehalose, melibiose, raffinose, melezitose, sorbitol, d-mannitol, 2-keto-d-gluconate, dl-lactate, citrate, and ethanol as the sole carbon source. However, the strain did not grow in the presence of l-sorbose, d-ribose, l-arabinose, cellobiose, salicin, lactose, erythritol, galactinol, or inositol. Strain MK883 did not grow with nitrate as a sole nitrogen source but thrived in the presence of nitrite, l-lysine, or cadaverine. These properties are consistent with those of C. palmioleophila (21Nakase T. Itoh M. Suzuki M. Komagata K. Kodama T. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1988; 34: 493-498Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), so we designated the isolate as C. palmioleophila MK883. Purification of Enzyme that Degrades Hydrazone—Cell-free extracts of C. palmioleophila MK883 had AEH-degrading activity that was completely lost after dialyzing the cell-free extract against buffer A. Adding either NAD+ or NADP+ (1 mm each) to the dialysate recovered the activity, although other cofactors (FAD, FMN, α-lipoic acid, CoA, acetyl-CoA, biotin, 1 mm each) were inactive (data not shown). We also found that absorption at 340 nm increased as the reaction proceeded. This showed that NAD+ was reduced to NADH during the reaction, and thus we measured enzyme activity by following the increase in the absorbance (Method B under “Experimental Procedures”) for purification. We purified the AEH-degrading activity 230-fold with 8.7% recovery from cell-free extracts of C. palmioleophila MK883 using four chromatographic separations (Table 1), each of which resulted in a single peak of activity. Resolution as a single band (59 kDa) on SDS-PAGE confirmed the homogeneity of the purified preparation (Fig. 3). The molecular mass of the enzyme calculated from gel-filtration chromatography was 120 kDa (data not shown), indicating that the purified enzyme was dimeric. After incubating the purified preparation with AEH and NAD+, AEH in the reaction mixture decreased while AMH, ADH, and acetate increased, indicating that the purified enzyme converted the hydrazone to relevant hydrazides. Reactions without NAD+ resulted in a minimal decrease of AEH and VEH. The specific activity of the purified Hdh for AEH, AMH, and VEH was 16.7, 14.5, and 22.7 μmol min-1mg-1, respectively, when 5 mm each of NAD+ and hydrazone were included.TABLE 1Summary of purification of HdhStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgμmol min−1μmol min−1 mg−1%Cell-free extract29621.80.073100DEAE-cellulose32.815.20.46670HAP3.6016.14.4874Resource Q0.7411.515.553Superose 6 10/300 GL0.152.5116.78.7 Open table in a new tab Stoichiometry of the Reaction—We examined the stoichiometry of hydrazone consumption and hydrazide formation at 30 °C in reactions containing 2 mm VEH, 2 mm NAD+, and 2 nmol of the enzyme in airtight tubes. After 120 min, 1.5 ± 0.1 mm of VEH was consumed and 1.5 ± 0.1, 1.5 ± 0.1, and 1.3 ± 0.1 mm of VH, acetate and NADH, respectively, were formed. Levels of acetaldehyde were below the limits of detection. The results are consistent with the stoichiometry of the following reaction. VEH + NAD+ + 2H2O → VH + acetate + NADH + H+REACTION 2 This can be described more simply by focusing on the reacting functional groups as scheme 4 in Fig. 1B. We further confirmed the stoichiometry using AEH as a substrate (data not shown). Reactions without NAD+ resulted in a minimal decrease of AEH and VEH (data not shown). These results indicated that the purified enzyme was hydrazone-NAD+ dehydrogenase (Hdh). C. palmioleophila Hdh Is a Novel Member of the ALDH Superfamily—We determined the N-terminal sequences of tryptic fragments of the purified protein, and cloned the cDNA and the gene for Hdh as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The deduced amino acid sequence comprised 519 amino acid residues and contained the internal amino acid sequences from the purified proteins (supplemental Fig. S1). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified enzyme started from Tyr22, indicating that a limited proteolysis removed the N-terminal 21 residues in the purified enzyme. The calculated molecular weight (without the N-terminal residues) was 53,443, which agreed closely with that of purified enzyme (59,000) estimated by SDS-PAGE. The deduced amino acid sequences of these proteins were significantly homologous to those of proteins in the Aldh superfamily and contained the sequence FYNT-GEVC (supplemental Fig. S1) that is consistent with the motif for the catalytic Cys (Cys301) and Gly (Gly298) residues, which are strictly conserved in proteins of the Aldh superfamily (22Perozich J.
