https://openalex.org/W1823409394,"Shor and Grover demonstrated that a quantum computer can outperform any classical computer in factoring numbers1 and in searching a database2 by exploiting the parallelism of quantum mechanics. Whereas Shor's algorithm requires both superposition and entanglement of a many-particle system3, the superposition of single-particle quantum states is sufficient for Grover's algorithm4. Recently, the latter has been successfully implemented5 using Rydberg atoms. Here we propose an implementation of Grover's algorithm that uses molecular magnets6,7,8,9,10, which are solid-state systems with a large spin; their spin eigenstates make them natural candidates for single-particle systems. We show theoretically that molecular magnets can be used to build dense and efficient memory devices based on the Grover algorithm. In particular, one single crystal can serve as a storage unit of a dynamic random access memory device. Fast electron spin resonance pulses can be used to decode and read out stored numbers of up to 105, with access times as short as 10-10 seconds. We show that our proposal should be feasible using the molecular magnets Fe8 and Mn12."

https://openalex.org/W2080937698,"The molecular mechanisms mediating the retinogenic potential of multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) are poorly defined. Prior to initiating retinogenesis, RPCs express a limited set of transcription factors implicated in the evolutionary ancient genetic network that initiates eye development. We elucidated the function of one of these factors, Pax6, in the RPCs of the intact developing eye by conditional gene targeting. Upon Pax6 inactivation, the potential of RPCs becomes entirely restricted to only one of the cell fates normally available to RPCs, resulting in the exclusive generation of amacrine interneurons. Our findings demonstrate furthermore that Pax6 directly controls the transcriptional activation of retinogenic bHLH factors that bias subsets of RPCs toward the different retinal cell fates, thereby mediating the full retinogenic potential of RPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2109173575,"BRCA1 interacts in vivo with a novel protein, BACH1, a member of the DEAH helicase family. BACH1 binds directly to the BRCT repeats of BRCA1. A BACH1 derivative, bearing a mutation in a residue that was essential for catalytic function in other helicases, interfered with normal double-strand break repair in a manner that was dependent on its BRCA1 binding function. Thus, BACH1/BRCA1 complex formation contributes to a key BRCA1 activity. In addition, germline BACH1 mutations affecting the helicase domain were detected in two early-onset breast cancer patients and not in 200 matched controls. Thus, it is conceivable that, like BRCA1, BACH1 is a target of germline cancer-inducing mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1968867081,"Sympathetic neurons require nerve growth factor for survival and die by apoptosis in its absence. Key steps in the death pathway include c-Jun activation, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and caspase activation. Here, we show that neurons rescued from NGF withdrawal-induced apoptosis by expression of dominant-negative c-Jun do not release cytochrome c from their mitochondria. Furthermore, we find that the mRNA for BIM(EL), a proapoptotic BCL-2 family member, increases in level after NGF withdrawal and that this is reduced by dominant-negative c-Jun. Finally, overexpression of BIM(EL) in neurons induces cytochrome c redistribution and apoptosis in the presence of NGF, and neurons injected with Bim antisense oligonucleotides or isolated from Bim(-/-) knockout mice die more slowly after NGF withdrawal."
https://openalex.org/W2139602348,"Human actions are causing declines in plant biodiversity, increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and increases in nitrogen deposition; however, the interactive effects of these factors on ecosystem processes are unknown. Reduced biodiversity has raised numerous concerns, including the possibility that ecosystem functioning may be affected negatively, which might be particularly important in the face of other global changes. Here we present results of a grassland field experiment in Minnesota, USA, that tests the hypothesis that plant diversity and composition influence the enhancement of biomass and carbon acquisition in ecosystems subjected to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen deposition. The study experimentally controlled plant diversity (1, 4, 9 or 16 species), soil nitrogen (unamended versus deposition of 4 g of nitrogen per m2 per yr) and atmospheric CO2 concentrations using free-air CO2 enrichment (ambient, 368 micromol mol-1, versus elevated, 560 micromol mol-1). We found that the enhanced biomass accumulation in response to elevated levels of CO2 or nitrogen, or their combination, is less in species-poor than in species-rich assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W2125545718,"Frizzled (Fz) and Dishevelled (Dsh) are components of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that regulates planar cell polarity. How this signaling pathway directs asymmetric cytoskeletal reorganization and polarized cell morphology remains unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila Rho-associated kinase (Drok) works downstream of Fz/Dsh to mediate a branch of the planar polarity pathway involved in ommatidial rotation in the eye and in restricting actin bundle formation to a single site in developing wing cells. The primary output of Drok signaling is regulating the phosphorylation of nonmuscle myosin regulatory light chain, and hence the activity of myosin II. Drosophila myosin VIIA, the homolog of the human Usher Syndrome 1B gene, also functions in conjunction with this newly defined portion of the Fz/Dsh signaling pathway to regulate the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2076985939,"The Escherichia coli OxyR transcription factor senses H2O2 and is activated through the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond. Here we present the crystal structures of the regulatory domain of OxyR in its reduced and oxidized forms, determined at 2.7 Å and 2.3 Å resolutions, respectively. In the reduced form, the two redox-active cysteines are separated by approximately 17 Å. Disulfide bond formation in the oxidized form results in a significant structural change in the regulatory domain. The structural remodeling, which leads to different oligomeric associations, accounts for the redox-dependent switch in OxyR and provides a novel example of protein regulation by “fold editing” through a reversible disulfide bond formation within a folded domain."
https://openalex.org/W2089521177,"Semliki Forest virus (SFV) has been extensively studied as a model for analyzing entry of enveloped viruses into target cells. Here we describe the trace of the polypeptide chain of the SFV fusion glycoprotein, E1, derived from an electron density map at 3.5 A resolution and describe its interactions at the surface of the virus. E1 is unexpectedly similar to the flavivirus envelope protein, with three structural domains disposed in the same primary sequence arrangement. These results introduce a new class of membrane fusion proteins which display lateral interactions to induce the necessary curvature and direct budding of closed particles. The resulting surface protein lattice is primed to cause membrane fusion when exposed to the acidic environment of the endosome."

https://openalex.org/W2107528191,"Sympathetic neuronal death induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation requires the macromolecular synthesis-dependent translocation of BAX from the cytosol to mitochondria and its subsequent integration into the mitochondrial outer membrane, followed by BAX-mediated cytochrome c (cyt c) release. The gene products triggering this process remain unknown. Here, we report that BIM, a member of the BH3-only proapoptotic subfamily of the BCL-2 protein family, is one such molecule. NGF withdrawal induced expression of BIM(EL), an integral mitochondrial membrane protein that functions upstream of (or in parallel with) the BAX/BCL-2 and caspase checkpoints. Bim deletion conferred protection against developmental and induced neuronal apoptosis in both central and peripheral populations, but only transiently, suggesting that BIM--and perhaps other BH3-only proteins--serve partially redundant functions upstream of BAX-mediated cyt c release."

https://openalex.org/W2003229373,"The effect of C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation on molecular motions in the Src kinases Hck and c-Src is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The SH2 and SH3 domains of the inactive kinases are seen to be tightly coupled by the connector between them, impeding activation. Dephosphorylation of the tail reduces the coupling between the SH2 and SH3 domains in the simulations, as does replacement of connector residues with glycine. A mutational analysis of c-Src expressed in Schizosaccharomyces pombe demonstrates that replacement of residues in the SH2-SH3 connector with glycine activates c-Src. The SH2-SH3 connector appears to be an inducible ""snap lock"" that clamps the SH2 and SH3 domains upon tail phosphorylation, but which allows flexibility when the tail is released."
https://openalex.org/W1968656665,"Transmembrane B ephrins and their Eph receptors signal bidirectionally. However, neither the cell biological effects nor signal transduction mechanisms of the reverse signal are well understood. We describe a cytoplasmic protein, PDZ-RGS3, which binds B ephrins through a PDZ domain, and has a regulator of heterotrimeric G protein signaling (RGS) domain. PDZ-RGS3 can mediate signaling from the ephrin-B cytoplasmic tail. SDF-1, a chemokine with a G protein-coupled receptor, or BDNF, act as chemoattractants for cerebellar granule cells, with SDF-1 action being selectively inhibited by soluble EphB receptor. This study reveals a pathway that links reverse signaling to cellular guidance, uncovers a novel mode of control for G proteins, and demonstrates a mechanism for selective regulation of responsiveness to neuronal guidance cues."
https://openalex.org/W2004085085,"We report an electroporation technique for targeting gene transfer to individual cells in intact tissue. Electrical stimulation through a micropipette filled with DNA or other macromolecules electroporates a single cell at the tip of the micropipette. Electroporation of a plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the brain of intact Xenopus tadpoles or rat hippocampal slices resulted in GFP expression in single neurons and glia. In vivo imaging showed morphologies, dendritic arbor dynamics, and growth rates characteristic of healthy cells. Coelectroporation of two plasmids resulted in expression of both proteins, while electroporation of fluorescent dextrans allowed direct visualization of transfer of molecules into cells. This technique will allow unprecedented spatial and temporal control over gene delivery and protein expression."

https://openalex.org/W1983078818,"Release of neurotransmitter at the inner hair cell (IHC) afferent synapse is a fundamental step in translating sound into auditory nerve excitation. To study the Ca2+ dependence of the underlying vesicle fusion and subsequent endocytosis, we combined Ca2+ uncaging with membrane capacitance measurements in mouse IHCs. Rapid elevations in [Ca2+]i above 8 microM caused a biphasic capacitance increase corresponding to the fusion of approximately 40,000 vesicles. The kinetics of exocytosis displayed a fifth-order Ca2+ dependence reaching maximal rates of >3 x 10(7) vesicle/s. Exocytosis was always followed by slow, compensatory endocytosis (tau congruent with 15 s). Higher [Ca2+]i increased the contribution of a faster mode of endocytosis with a Ca2+ independent time constant of approximately 300 ms. These properties provide for rapid and sustained transmitter release from this large presynaptic terminal."

https://openalex.org/W2095381111,"The GGAs constitute a family of modular adaptor-related proteins that bind ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) and localize to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) via their GAT domains. Here, we show that binding of the GAT domain stabilizes membrane-bound ARF1.GTP due to interference with the action of GTPase-activating proteins. We also show that the hinge and ear domains of the GGAs interact with clathrin in vitro, and that the GGAs promote recruitment of clathrin to liposomes in vitro and to TGN membranes in vivo. These observations suggest that the GGAs could function to link clathrin to membrane-bound ARF.GTP."
https://openalex.org/W2036518710,"Compared to neurons, the intracellular mechanisms that control glial differentiation are still poorly understood. We show here that oligodendrocyte lineage cells express the helix-loop-helix proteins Mash1 and Id2. Although Mash1 has been found to regulate neuronal development, we found that in the absence of Mash1 oligodendrocyte differentiation occurs normally. In contrast, we found that overexpression of Id2 powerfully inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation, that Id2 normally translocates out of the nucleus at the onset of differentiation, and that absence of Id2 induces premature oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro. These findings demonstrate that Id2 is a component of the intracellular mechanism that times oligodendrocyte differentiation and point to the existence of an as yet unidentified MyoD-like bHLH protein necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2080760617,"Mossy fibers are the sole excitatory projection from dentate gyrus granule cells to the hippocampus, where they release glutamate, dynorphin, and zinc. In addition, mossy fiber terminals show intense immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Fast inhibitory transmission at mossy fiber synapses, however, has not previously been reported. Here, we show that electrical or chemical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons. These inhibitory signals satisfy the criteria that distinguish mossy fiber-CA3 synapses: high sensitivity to metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists, facilitation during repetitive stimulation, and NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation. GABAergic transmission from the dentate gyrus to CA3 has major implications not only for information flow into the hippocampus but also for developmental and pathological processes involving the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2014539773,"There are 80 spikes on the surface of Sindbis virus arranged as an icosahedral surface lattice. Each spike consists of three copies of each of the glycoproteins E1 and E2. There are two glycosylation sites on E1 and two on E2. These four sites have been located by removal of the glycosylation recognition motifs using site-specific mutagenesis, followed by cryoelectron microscopy. The positions of these sites have demonstrated that E2 forms the protruding spikes and that E1 must be long and narrow, lying flat on the viral surface, forming an icosahedral scaffold analogous to the arrangement of the E glycoprotein in flaviviruses. This arrangement of E1 leads to both dimeric and trimeric intermolecular contacts, consistent with the observed structural changes that occur on fusion with host cell membranes, suggesting a similar fusion mechanism for alpha- and flaviviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2149372516,"The activation of silent synapses is a proposed mechanism to account for rapid increases in synaptic efficacy such as long-term potentiation (LTP). Using simultaneous recordings from individual pre- and postsynaptic neurons in organotypic hippocampal slices, we show that two CA3 neurons can be connected entirely by silent synapses. Increasing release probability or application of cyclothiazide does not produce responses from these silent synapses. Direct measurement of NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic responses in all-silent synaptic connections before and after LTP induction show no change in failure rate, amplitude, or area. These data do not support hypotheses that synapse silent results from presynaptic factors or that LTP results from increases in presynaptic glutamate release. LTP is also associated with an increase in postsynaptic responsiveness to exogenous AMPA. We conclude that synapse silence, activation, and expression of LTP are postsynaptic."
https://openalex.org/W1610967198,"The successful retrieval of ancient DNA from two geographically dispersed Neanderthal skeletons1,2 has fuelled a demand for more Neanderthal DNA sequences for analysis. However, these exceptionally well-preserved specimens were geologically young and the mean annual temperature of their cave sites low, so the survival of this ancient DNA could have been due to unusually favourable conditions. Here we calculate the thermal history of a range of Holocene and Pleistocene bones whose DNA quality has been tested and find that in only very few sites with Neanderthal remains is the preservation of DNA likely to match the quality of that from the skeleton found at Mezmaiskaya Cave2. We recommend that any additional Neanderthal destined for destructive analysis should be carefully selected, taking into account its integrated thermal history."
https://openalex.org/W2052287351,"The Clock mutation lengthens periodicity and reduces amplitude of circadian rhythms in mice. The effects of Clock are cell intrinsic and can be observed at the level of single neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. To address how cells of contrasting genotype functionally interact in vivo to control circadian behavior, we have analyzed a series of Clock mutant mouse aggregation chimeras. Circadian behavior in Clock/Clock ↔ wild-type chimeric individuals was determined by the proportion of mutant versus normal cells. Significantly, a number of intermediate phenotypes, including Clock/+ phenocopies and novel combinations of the parental behavioral characteristics, were seen in balanced chimeras. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to quantitatively analyze relationships among circadian period, amplitude, and suprachiasmatic nucleus composition. Together, our results demonstrate that complex integration of cellular phenotypes determines the generation and expression of coherent circadian rhythms at the organismal level."

It is powered largely by energy extracted from planetary rotation, although there seems also to be a contribution from the solar wind. This contrasts with Earth's aurora, which is generated through the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere. The major features of Jupiter's aurora (based on far-ultraviolet, near-infrared and visible-wavelength observations) include a main oval that generally corotates with the planet and a region of patchy, diffuse emission inside the oval on Jupiter's dusk side. Here we report the discovery of a rapidly evolving, very bright and localized emission poleward of the northern main oval, in a region connected magnetically to Jupiter's outer magnetosphere. The intensity of the emission increased by a factor of 30 within 70 s, and then decreased on a similar timescale, all captured during a single four-minute exposure. This type of flaring emission has not previously been reported for Jupiter (similar, but smaller, transient events have been observed at Earth), and it may be related directly to changes in the solar wind."

Cells from patients with FA exhibit genomic instability and hypersensitivity to DNA cross linking agents such as mitomycin C. Despite the identification of seven complementation groups and the cloning of six genes, the function of the encoded gene products remains elusive. The FancA (Fanconi anemia complementation group A), FancC, and FancG proteins have been detected within a nuclear complex, but no change in level, binding, or localization has been reported as a result of drug treatment or cell cycle. We show that in immunofluorescence studies, FancA appears as a non-nucleolar nuclear protein that is excluded from condensed, mitotic chromosomes. Biochemical fractionation reveals that the FA proteins are found in nuclear matrix and chromatin and that treatment with mitomycin C results in increase of the FA proteins in nuclear matrix and chromatin fractions. This induction occurs in wild-type cells and mutant FA-D (Fanconi complementation group D) cells but not in mutant FA-A cells. Immunoprecipitation of FancA protein in chromatin demonstrates the coprecipitation of FancA, FancC, and FancG, showing that the FA proteins move together as a complex. Also, fractionation of mitotic cells confirms the lack of FA proteins in chromatin or the nuclear matrix.

This suggests that a nuclear event is critical to the normal function of the FA proteins, and the aberrant protein in the FA-D group may have a role downstream of the FA complex in the nucleus. To date, other than the alteration of binding, nuclear localization, and FancA phosphorylation in mutant FA complementation groups, no other consistent biochemical change has been described, although some have described variations in FancC levels in the cell cycle (31Heinrich M.C.

In our study, we have found that the FA proteins not only reside in the nucleus but also are closely associated with the nuclear matrix and chromatin. The nuclear matrix is a loose mechanical framework of proteins that has also been implicated in enzymatic activities in the regulation of transcription, replication, and DNA repair. The nuclear matrix is intimately associated with chromatin. BRG and brm, the human swi-snf homologues, are examples of nuclear matrix proteins involved in transcriptional regulation that change phosphorylation state, shift to chromatin, and become distinct from the nuclear matrix during mitosis (33Muchardt C. Reyes J.C. Bourachot B. Leguoy E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3394-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 34Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Mol.

Immunofluorescence of FancA reveals a similar shift away from the condensed chromosomes of mitosis, suggesting that they also interact with chromatin and the nuclear matrix. Our studies demonstrate that the FA proteins associate with chromatin and the nuclear matrix in an inducible fashion. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. FA fibroblasts cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. FA-C mutant cells (PD4) were grown in RPMI + 15% FBS. Mutant and corrected pairs of cell lines were prepared as previously described: GM6914 (ATCC) ± pMMP-FANCA (FA-A), and PD20 ± minichromosome 3p (20) containing the FancD locus (FA-D cells, Markus Grompe, Portland, OR) (14Whitney M.

HeLa cells were treated overnight with 2 mm thymidine, washed, released into regular media, and treated again overnight with thymidine (38White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. MCB ( Mol. Cell. Biol. ). 1995; 15: 6653-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells were then released for no time (G1-S border), 3 h (S phase), 6 h (G2), or overnight in the presence of 1 μmnocodazole (Sigma). Mitotic cells were collected the next morning by shaking the plate and collecting the cells in suspension. Verification of cell cycle state was achieved using FACScan analysis (Becton Dickinson) (39Stonesifer K. Xiang J. Wilkinson E. Benson N. Braylan R. Acta Cytol. 1987; 31: 125-130PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μl of confluent, trypsinized cells were plated into 250 μl of media on 8-chamber slides and allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C. The slides were washed in PBS and immediately fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by 10 min in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, all at room temperature. The chambers were then exposed to primary antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and washed in 0.1% Nonidet P-40/PBS and PBS. The slides were then exposed to fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-rabbit secondary antibody and DAPI and then covered with mounting solution with anti-fade (Vectashield) (25Naf D. Kupfer G.M. Suliman A. Lambert K. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5952-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Procedures for permeabilization and sequential subnuclear extraction were adapted from the methods of Burtelow et al., and Reyes et al. (40Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 35Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In brief, cells pelleted (100 μl) from one large plate were resuspended and permeabilized in 5 ml of low salt buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, and 50 μg/ml digitonin) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4) for 15 min, 4 °C. Permeabilized nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 rpm, 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was termed the soluble fraction. The nuclei were washed two additional times in the same buffer. After wash, the nuclei were resuspended in 200 μl of permeabilization buffer containing 30 units of DNase I (RNase free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 15 min, room temperature and an additional 15 min, 37 °C. For the purpose of comparing no DNase versus+ DNase, the chromatin was incubated for 1 h, 4 °C. Chromatin proteins were extracted by adding extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 30 mmNa4P2O7·10H2O, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm EDTA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 10 min, 4 °C. Supernatant collected at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge for 10 min was termed the chromatin fraction. The pellet was extracted in urea buffer (8 murea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0). The supernatant collected after high speed microfuge spin was termed the nuclear matrix. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assays. FancA and FancC antisera were prepared as previously described (24Kupfer G.M. Naf D. Suliman A. Pulsipher M. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). pGEX-FancG(N) (Alan D'Andrea, Boston, MA) containing the N-terminal half of FancG was transformed into DH5α, and GST-FancG(N) was prepared and injected into a rabbit (University of Virginia animal protocol 5814). Serum was screened by Western blot and further purified over a column containing GST-FancG(N). Topoisomerase II (Oncogene Science) and lamin B antibodies (Oncogene Science) were obtained commercially. Histone 4 antibody was provided courtesy of Dr. David Allis, University of Virginia. A cellular crude lysate or chromatin extract was prepared as above. Two mg of protein in 1 ml of the respective buffers containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors was incubated with 2 μg of both anti-N- and anti-C-terminal FancA antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the resulting mix was rotated at 4 °C for an additional h. Anti-FancA antiserum was added to 2 mg of extract and incubated for 1 h, 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h, 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and dried. 50 μl of loading buffer was added (24Kupfer G.M. Naf D. Suliman A. Pulsipher M. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was conducted followed by gel transfer in 25 mm Tris and 200 mmglycine onto nylon-supported nitrocellulose. Filters were blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS and then were incubated in TBS plus Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing primary antibody overnight at room temperature. Filters were then washed in TBS-T, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed again, and visualized by chemiluminescence (24Kupfer G.M. Naf D. Suliman A. Pulsipher M. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Phosphatase reactions were adapted from previous protocols (40Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). FancG immunoprecipitation was conducted on 2 mg of whole cell extracts, as described. Immunoprecipitates were treated with λ phosphatase (Boehringer) for 30 min at 30 °C in 100 μl of reaction buffer containing 0, 50, and 100 units of enzyme in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors. All reactions were stopped by addition of 40 μl of 4X loading buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. In search of clues to FA protein function, we studied the microscopic appearance of the FancA protein. Immunofluorescence was conducted on FA-A mutant cells either containing no detectable FancA or corrected with pMMP-FancA. Visualization of FancA with anti-FancA serum on corrected FA-A cells revealed strong granular nuclear staining and no detectable staining in the nucleoli (Fig. 1, interphase cell). FancA was excluded from condensed chromosomes completely in mitotic cells (Fig. 1, mitotic cell) as evidenced by counterstain with DAPI. Mutant cells were completely unstained by anti-FancA. This appearance is similar to published patterns of chromatin-associated and nuclear matrix proteins, such as brm and BRG, which are involved in DNA repair, maintenance of genomic stability, and transcription regulation (33Muchardt C. Reyes J.C. Bourachot B. Leguoy E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3394-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 34Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 35Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy suggests that FA proteins are associated with nuclear matrix and chromatin. Chromatin is arranged in higher order structures with DNA packaged around core histones into nucleosomes (41Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 42Smith M.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine whether FA proteins are tightly associated with DNA, permeabilized HeLa cells were treated with or without DNase for 1 h at 4 °C. FA proteins were predominately released only when treated with DNase (Fig.2). This result indicates that FA proteins are chromatin-bound and are specifically released after DNase treatment, suggesting an intimate association with DNA. Chromatin and nuclear matrix-associated proteins are involved in activities such as transcription, replication, DNA repair, and maintenance of genomic stability. Because the immunofluorescent microscopic appearance of FancA is suggestive of chromatin and nuclear matrix proteins, we analyzed the subnuclear localization of FancA, FancC, and FancG by biochemical fractionation (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblotting of preparations made from HeLa cells and mutant and corrected pairs of FA-A and FA-D cells revealed that FancA, FancC, and FancG were all found in the chromatin and nuclear matrix fractions (Fig.3 A). Extract from mutant FA-C cells containing no full-length FancC was used as a control. Mutant FA-A cells exhibited the absence of chromatin and nuclear matrix localization of FancA, FancC, and FancG proteins. Our subnuclear fractionation experiments confirmed the immunofluorescence data that FA proteins are found in chromatin and the nuclear matrix of the cell. However, previous work has shown association of the FA proteins only under standard immunoprecipitation conditions that by definition omit chromatin-bound proteins. To confirm chromatin localization and to demonstrate association of the FA proteins, anti-FancA immunoprecipitations were performed using chromatin extract prepared from the indicated cell lines (Fig. 3 B). Immunoblotting revealed the coprecipitation of FancC and FancG with FancA. This result was noted in the FA-A corrected line, HeLa, and FA-D corrected line as well as the FA-D mutant line in which FancA, FancC, and FancG have been noted to coprecipitate and localize to the nucleus. The FA protein complex appears intact in a variety of locations including cytoplasm and nuclear extract prepared using standard lysis conditions. However, these data show that the complex, easily coprecipitated in standard lysis conditions, can also be detected intact in a low salt, DNase-liberated chromatin extract. In previous work no inducibility of the FA proteins in location or level has been demonstrated in response to bifunctional alkylating agents even though these agents cause hypersensitivity in mutant FA cells (31Heinrich M.C. Silvey K.V. Stone S. Zigler A.J. Griffith D.J. Montalto M. Chai L. Zhi Y. Hoatlin M.E. Blood. 2000; 95: 3970-3977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kupfer G. Yamashita T. Naf D. Suliman A. Asano S. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 1997; 90: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies did not selectively analyze chromatin or the nuclear matrix. Therefore, we analyzed the subnuclear localization of FancA, FancC, and FancG in response to MMC treatment. HeLa cells were treated for 24 h with 0.01, 0.1 (90% cell kill in mutant FA cells, 10% kill in wild-type in 4 days, respectively), and 1 μm MMC. The cells were subjected to sequential subnuclear fractionation as above. Increased FA proteins appeared in chromatin (Fig.4 A) and nuclear matrix fractions (Fig. 4 B) with peak effect occurring at 0.1 μm. The fidelity of the subnuclear fractionation and equal loading was demonstrated by the topoisomerase II and lamin B blotting. Cells were also treated with 0.1 μm MMC and sampled at 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h of drug exposure. Increased FA proteins were found in chromatin (Fig. 4 C) and nuclear matrix (Fig. 4 D) by 4 h with peak occurring by 24 h. HeLa cells were also treated with ionizing radiation doses of 0, 100, 250, and 500 centigrays and collected 24 h after treatment. In contrast to MMC treatment, analysis of chromatin (Fig.4 E) and nuclear matrix (Fig. 4 F) fractions displayed no increase in FA proteins. HeLa cells were treated with 250 centigrays and collected at time points after exposure. Analysis again showed no increase in FA protein levels in chromatin (Fig.4 G) and nuclear matrix (Fig. 4 H). The induction time course of FA protein localization by MMC seems consistent with the idea that the cell must first encounter the DNA cross-link during S phase as proposed in recent work (43Akkari Y.M. Bateman R.L. Reifsteck C.A. Olson S.B. Grompe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8283-8289Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Other cell lines were analyzed as well. FA-A mutant and corrected cells were tested similarly by treatment with 0.1 μm MMC. Maximal effect was seen after 48 h of treatment. FA-A mutant cells (GM6914) contain no endogenous FancA. Only the corrected cells exhibited increased localization of FA proteins to chromatin and nuclear matrix (Fig. 4 I) after treatment. FA-D mutant and corrected cells were also studied by 24 h treatment with 0.1 μm MMC. In this case, both the mutant and corrected cells displayed increased FA protein localization to chromatin (Fig.4 J) and nuclear matrix (Fig. 4 K). These data are consistent with those previously reported that FA proteins are absent from the nucleus in all the complementation groups except FA-D, in which mutant cells contain FancA, FancC, and FancG in a nuclear complex. FA proteins inducibly localize to chromatin and nuclear matrix upon MMC treatment. Because of the immunofluorescence microscopy that demonstrated exit of FA proteins at mitosis, we analyzed the effect of the cell cycle upon subnuclear localization. HeLa cells were synchronized using double thymidine blockade to produce arrest at the G1-S border. Upon release, the cells were collected and were subjected to sequential subnuclear fractionation. Synchronization was verified by FACScan analysis (data not shown). FA proteins exhibited little or no change in the chromatin or nuclear matrix fractions at the G1-S border, S phase, or G2 phase (Fig.5). However, at mitosis, as indicated by the lack of lamin B in the nuclear matrix fraction, no FA proteins were detected in chromatin or the nuclear matrix suggesting exit of the FA proteins from condensed chromosomes. Chromatin and the nuclear matrix appeared to remain intact even though the nuclear envelope had dissolved as topoisomerase II was still detectable in both fractions. A higher mobility form of FancG was noticeable at mitosis in the soluble fraction. This nuclear subfractionation experiment is consistent with the immunofluorescent appearance of FancA and its disappearance from condensed chromosomes at mitosis as seen in Fig. 1. The FA proteins translocate from condensed chromosomes at mitosis as shown by biochemical fractionation. Interestingly, FancG exists as a higher mobility isoform at mitosis. To determine the nature of the higher mobility isoform of FancG at mitosis, whole cell extract was prepared from mitotic and asynchronous HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FancA or anti-FancG antiserum. Subsequent immunoblotting showed that three isoforms of FancG specifically immunoprecipitate with anti-FancG and coprecipitate with FancA in mitotic extract (Fig.6 A). Asynchronous extract contained only one isoform of FancG. To demonstrate that the higher mobility forms of FancG are phosphorylated, anti-FancG-immunoprecipitated beads were incubated with λ phosphatase. The two higher mobility forms of FancG were removed by phosphatase reaction at 30 °C. Incubation at 30 °C without phosphatase or incubation with the phosphatase inhibitor sodium pyrophosphate resulted in retention of both forms. Sodium orthovanadate inhibited the removal of only the lower of the two bands. This phenomenon mirrors the regulation and shift in localization of other proteins such as the human swi-snf protein complex. The FA proteins are of unknown function yet have been shown to localize to the nucleus, a localization which is functionally important to correction of the FA DNA cross-linker hypersensitivity. In mutant cells, FA proteins remain largely in the cytoplasm and do not interact in a complex except in FA-D cells. In this study, we show that the FA proteins FancA, FancC, and FancG associate with the nuclear matrix and chromatin. The proteins specifically shift to chromatin and nuclear matrix in an inducible way by MMC treatment, to which FA cells are hypersensitive. FA proteins are similar to other chromatin and nuclear matrix-bound proteins in their fractionation, appearance by immunofluorescence, and exclusion from condensed chromosomes during mitosis. This exclusion is temporally related to phosphorylation of FancG, which remains bound to the other FA proteins. Until this study, little evidence has emerged that has shown an inducible response of FA proteins to drug treatment or cell cycle. Previous data have shown variations in FancC (31Heinrich M.C. Silvey K.V. Stone S. Zigler A.J. Griffith D.J. Montalto M. Chai L. Zhi Y. Hoatlin M.E. Blood. 2000; 95: 3970-3977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kupfer G. Yamashita T. Naf D. Suliman A. Asano S. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 1997; 90: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but change in the total level of complexed FA protein does not seem to change2. To perform these experiments, overexpression systems have been used, resulting in increased amounts of cytoplasmic and soluble nuclear proteins. However, we have not observed any increase in the amount of complexed, chromatin-bound, or nuclear matrix FA proteins as a result of overexpression; indeed, HeLa cells contain high, endogenous levels of FA proteins in these subnuclear compartments. Although we are unable to directly immunoprecipitate the complex from the nuclear matrix because of the requirement for urea solubilization, the same pattern of localization, protein level, and shift in response to drug treatment and cell cycle imply association of the FA proteins at least functionally. In addition to the emerging importance of nuclear matrix proteins, recent evidence supports the FA protein data presented here. A report on FancA and FancC binding to a nuclear structural protein, human α spectrin, has been described (44Pemov A. Bavykin S. Hamlin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This complex has been shown to purify with endonuclease activity (45McMahon L.W. Walsh C.E. Lambert M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32904-32908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). One attractive hypothesis is that the structural array that spectrin is part of is responsible for the mechanical manipulation in response to DNA damage that allows for the FA complex to translocate to the chromatin where presumably DNA repair can be carried out. In addition, defective non-homologous end joining has been postulated to be abnormal in FA, implying a necessity for DNA binding (46Brois D.W. McMahon L.W. Ramos N.I. Anglin L.M. Walsh C.E. Lambert M.W. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 47Escarceller M. Rousset S. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. Somat. Cell Mol.

Res. 1999; 431: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because this shift of proteins seems to occur relatively quickly upon drug treatment and occurs before the well documented G2/M accumulation, it is unclear what importance a presumed G2/M checkpoint is for FA protein function. Given that the shift is occurring by 12–16 h after drug treatment, this shift could very well be indicative of an S phase checkpoint, the importance of which has been suggested by recent reports (43Akkari Y.M. Bateman R.L. Reifsteck C.A. Olson S.B. Grompe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8283-8289Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 50Sala-Trepat M. Rouillard D. Escarceller M. Laquerbe A. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The stimulus for protein shift could conceivably arise from a cytoplasmic signal as well as from a nuclear signal. Several groups have reported defects in interferon signaling, stat signaling, and association of FA proteins with cytochrome P450 machinery (51Li Y. Youssoufian H. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2873-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 52Wang J. Otsuki T. Youssoufian H. Foe J.L. Kim S. Devetten M., Yu, J. Li Y. Dunn D. Liu J.M.

The potential for cytoplasmic signaling could resolve the controversial data that support the importance for cytoplasmic versus nuclear events in FA biochemistry. The shift of FA proteins to chromatin suggests a direct or indirect interaction with DNA. Our next studies will focus on this interaction using naked or DNA templates in nucleosomal form and purified proteins. We will also attempt to define a potential kinase for FancG. A potential kinase that can be tested is the G2/M cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2, which has been reported to bind to FancC (32Kupfer G. Yamashita T. Naf D. Suliman A. Asano S. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 1997; 90: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts at recapitulation of FA protein functionin vitro will be crucial in unlocking its biochemical pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1964237551,"G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels, GIRK/Kir3.x, are gated by the Gbetagamma subunits of the G protein. The molecular mechanism of gating was investigated by employing a novel yeast-based random mutagenesis approach that selected for channel mutants that are active in the absence of Gbetagamma. Mutations in TM2 were found that mimicked the Gbetagamma-activated state. The activity of these channel mutants was independent of receptor stimulation and of the availability of heterologously expressed Gbetagamma subunits but depended on PtdIns(4,5)P(2). The results suggest that the TM2 region plays a key role in channel gating following Gbetagamma binding in a phospholipid-dependent manner. This mechanism of gating in inwardly rectifying K+ channels may be similar to the involvement of the homologous region in prokaryotic KcsA potassium channel and, thus, suggests evolutionary conservation of the gating structure."

PCC7942, at a CO(2) concentration below its threshold for CO(2) fixation, was higher than that of the wild type. At saturating light intensity, net CO(2) uptake was similar in the wild type and in the mutant IL-3 suggesting common limitation by the rate of conversion of CO(2) to HCO3(-). These findings are consistent with a model postulating that electron transport-dependent formation of alkaline domains on the thylakoid membrane energizes intracellular conversion of CO(2) to HCO3(-)."

Upon activation, M-CSF-R dimerizes and autophosphorylates on specific tyrosines, creating binding sites for several cytoplasmic SH2-containing signaling molecules that relay and modulate the M-CSF signal. Here we show that M-CSF-R interacts with suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (Socs1), a negative regulator of various cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways. Using the yeast two-hybrid system,in vitro glutathione S-transferase-M-CSF-R pull-down, and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrated a direct interaction between the SH2 domain of Socs1 and phosphorylated tyrosines 697 or 721 of the M-CSF-R kinase insert region. Moreover, Socs1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to M-CSF. Ectopic expression of Socs1 in FDC-P1/MAC and EML hematopoietic cell lines decreased their growth rates in the presence of limiting concentrations of M-CSF. However, Socs1 expression did not totally suppress long term cell growth in the presence of saturating M-CSF concentrations, in contrast to other cytokines such as stem cell factor and interleukin 3. Taken together, these results suggest that Socs1 is an M-CSF-R-binding partner involved in negative regulation of proliferation signaling and that it differentially affects cytokine receptor signals.

Socs1 binds to all Janus kinase family members and inhibits their tyrosine kinase activity, which is needed for the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). Because the Janus kinase pathway is also essential for signaling by many cytokine receptors devoid of intrinsic kinase activity, Socs1 may be a general negative regulator of signaling through these receptors.Socs1 is also a modular multidomain protein that can interact with other signaling proteins. Its N-terminal region contains diproline sites that interact with the SH3-containing proteins Nck, Grb2, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Fyn, and Itk kinases. The Socs1 SH2 domain binds to the N-terminal region of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner. The C-terminal Socs box, common to all Socs family members, interacts with B and C elongins (19De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rose J. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 28De Sepulveda P. Ilangumaran S. Rottapel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that Socs1 also binds to the Kit and Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinases. The interaction requires Socs1 SH2 domain and phosphorylation of the receptors on as yet unknown tyrosine autophosphorylation sites (19De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rose J. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although it does not inhibit Kit tyrosine kinase activity, ectopic expression of Socs1 strongly suppresses the proliferative signal of the Kit receptor, suggesting that negative regulation involves not only Janus kinase inhibition but also other mechanisms as yet unknown (19De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rose J. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the interaction between Socs1 and M-CSF-R to 1) identify the receptor site(s) of the interaction as a model for other receptor tyrosine kinases and 2) determine whether Socs1 has the same effect on two closely related receptor tyrosine kinases, Kit and Fms. We show that Socs1 directly associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated M-CSF receptor upon M-CSF binding. In vitro and in vivoexperiments demonstrated that this interaction involves the SH2 domain of Socs1 and tyrosines 697 or 721 of the Fms kinase insert (KI) domain. Ectopic expression of Socs1 in two different hematopoietic cell lines inhibited M-CSF-dependent proliferation but only in the presence of limiting concentrations of M-CSF. This result suggests that Socs1 could act as a general negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase proliferation signals, but its effects may be quantitatively different depending on the type of receptor.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have characterized the in vitro and in vivo interaction between Socs1 and Fms/M-CSF-R. In vivo interaction between Socs proteins and several receptor tyrosine kinases has been previously reported; Socs1 binds to both Kit and Flt3 (19De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rose J. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), Socs2 binds to the insulin-like growth factor receptor (41Dey B.R. Spence S.L. Nissley P. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24095-24101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and Socs3 binds to the insulin receptor (42Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Until now, the receptor autophosphorylation sites involved in these interactions remained to be determined. Here we show that the SH2 domain of Socs1 binds to two phosphotyrosines located in the Fms kinase insert. These two sites are tyrosines 697 and 721, which are the Fms binding site for the Grb2 adapter and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively. Interestingly, the Socs1 N-terminal region contains diproline motifs that recognize the SH3 domains of Grb2 and p85 (19De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rose J. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that Socs1 binding may not decrease, but on the contrary extend, the M-CSF-R signaling repertoire. Because these two sites are the first Socs1 binding sites to be described on receptors, it would be interesting to test whether Grb2 and/or p85 sites are also docking sites for Socs1 in other receptor tyrosine kinases. We have also shown that Socs1 was rapidly and transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to M-CSF, as described for other Fms-interacting molecules (17Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.-L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Socs2 and Socs3 tyrosine phosphorylation has recently been described in response to insulin-like growth factor and IL-2, respectively (43Dey B.R. Furlanetto R.W. Nissley P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 44Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The precise role and importance of Socs tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating its function is yet unknown. Concerning Socs1, it would be interesting to locate the phosphorylation site(s) and to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation also occurs in response to other signals and whether it affects such Socs1 functions as Janus kinase inhibition.The biological relevance of the interaction between Socs1 and M-CSF-R is supported by the fact that Socs1 expression resulted in a decreased M-CSF-dependent proliferation of two different cell lines, including the FDC-P1/MAC cells that express endogenous M-CSF-R and are a physiological model for Fms signaling (37Gliniak B.C. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Socs1 protein is unstable in cells, and Socs1 synthesis is strongly repressed at the translation level (45Gregorieff A. Pyronnet S. Sonnenberg N. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21596-21604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, endogenous Socs1 protein has so far been described only in mouse T lymphocytes after immunoprecipitation (45Gregorieff A. Pyronnet S. Sonnenberg N. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21596-21604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For this reason, we expressed Socs1 ectopically to study its functional interactions in vivo. Socs1 promoter expression has been detected in vivo in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (27Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Elefanty A.G. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Starr R. Mifsud S. Di Rago L. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that both M-CSF-R and Socs1 are coexpressed during monocytic development. Interestingly, Socs1 negatively regulated M-CSF-R proliferation signal only in the presence of nearly physiological limiting concentrations of M-CSF (46Tushinski R.J. Oliver I.T. Guilbert L.J. Tynan P.W. Warner J.R. Stanley E.R. Cell. 1982; 28: 71-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar).Altogether, our data suggest that Socs1 may act as a negative regulator of the M-CSF-R proliferation signal; there are different ways in which Socs1 could be involved in Fms signaling. First, M-CSF-R activates the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway in myeloid cells (47Novak U. Nice E. Hamilton J.A. Paradiso L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2607-2613PubMed Google Scholar); Socs1 recruitment by M-CSF-R could then specifically inhibit this pathway. Socs1 may also link the receptor to the ubiquitin machinery, as demonstrated for Vav (28De Sepulveda P. Ilangumaran S. Rottapel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which could occur through the interaction of the Socs box with ubiquitin ligase complexes. The present study also clearly shows that Socs1 does not equally affect proliferation signals of different receptors. Socs1 strongly suppressed IL-3 and SCF receptor signals, whereas its effects on M-CSF-R were less intense. In that respect, Socs1 offers an example of how a signaling molecule can differentially modify receptor signaling and thereby control the balance between self-renewal and commitment to differentiation. Finally, our experiments demonstrated that it is possible to obtain stable expression of Socs1 in IL-3- or SCF-dependent cell lines as long as they are maintained in the presence of high concentrations of M-CSF. Such cells represent valuable models for studying the early effects of Socs1 on other receptor signals after shifting the cells from M-CSF to other growth factor (e.g. IL-3 or SCF)-containing medium. In conclusion, our work provides the first evidence for a connection between M-CSF-R and Socs1, and we are now investigating the role of other members of the Socs family during monocyte development as controlled by M-CSF-R. Hematopoiesis is mainly under the control of soluble and membrane-bound factors acting through specific transmembrane receptors (1Metcalf D. Nature. 1989; 339: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). These receptors transduce intracellular messages by recruiting and activating a given set of cytoplasmic molecules that initiate specific signaling pathways, which then spread throughout the compartments of the cell, modifying its activity (2Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). What results from setting off these multiple biochemical signals is a global cellular response: proliferation, differentiation, activation, and/or survival. It is therefore important to determine the identity, stoichiometry, and function of the molecules present in the initial signaling complex formed in concert with the growth factor receptor.

Analysis of mice with homozygous inactivation of the Socs1 gene confirmed its role as a negative growth signal regulator. Socs1 −/− mice died within 21 days of birth, with a complex fatal neonatal disease, due to a defect in the negative regulation of interferon γ signaling (25Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E.

Socs1 binds to all Janus kinase family members and inhibits their tyrosine kinase activity, which is needed for the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). Because the Janus kinase pathway is also essential for signaling by many cytokine receptors devoid of intrinsic kinase activity, Socs1 may be a general negative regulator of signaling through these receptors. Socs1 is also a modular multidomain protein that can interact with other signaling proteins. Its N-terminal region contains diproline sites that interact with the SH3-containing proteins Nck, Grb2, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Fyn, and Itk kinases. The Socs1 SH2 domain binds to the N-terminal region of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner. The C-terminal Socs box, common to all Socs family members, interacts with B and C elongins (19De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rose J. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 28De Sepulveda P. Ilangumaran S. Rottapel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Socs1 also binds to the Kit and Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinases. The interaction requires Socs1 SH2 domain and phosphorylation of the receptors on as yet unknown tyrosine autophosphorylation sites (19De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rose J. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although it does not inhibit Kit tyrosine kinase activity, ectopic expression of Socs1 strongly suppresses the proliferative signal of the Kit receptor, suggesting that negative regulation involves not only Janus kinase inhibition but also other mechanisms as yet unknown (19De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rose J. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the interaction between Socs1 and M-CSF-R to 1) identify the receptor site(s) of the interaction as a model for other receptor tyrosine kinases and 2) determine whether Socs1 has the same effect on two closely related receptor tyrosine kinases, Kit and Fms. We show that Socs1 directly associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated M-CSF receptor upon M-CSF binding. In vitro and in vivoexperiments demonstrated that this interaction involves the SH2 domain of Socs1 and tyrosines 697 or 721 of the Fms kinase insert (KI) domain. Ectopic expression of Socs1 in two different hematopoietic cell lines inhibited M-CSF-dependent proliferation but only in the presence of limiting concentrations of M-CSF. This result suggests that Socs1 could act as a general negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase proliferation signals, but its effects may be quantitatively different depending on the type of receptor. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have characterized the in vitro and in vivo interaction between Socs1 and Fms/M-CSF-R. In vivo interaction between Socs proteins and several receptor tyrosine kinases has been previously reported; Socs1 binds to both Kit and Flt3 (19De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rose J. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), Socs2 binds to the insulin-like growth factor receptor (41Dey B.R. Spence S.L. Nissley P. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24095-24101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and Socs3 binds to the insulin receptor (42Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Until now, the receptor autophosphorylation sites involved in these interactions remained to be determined. Here we show that the SH2 domain of Socs1 binds to two phosphotyrosines located in the Fms kinase insert. These two sites are tyrosines 697 and 721, which are the Fms binding site for the Grb2 adapter and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively. Interestingly, the Socs1 N-terminal region contains diproline motifs that recognize the SH3 domains of Grb2 and p85 (19De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rose J. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that Socs1 binding may not decrease, but on the contrary extend, the M-CSF-R signaling repertoire. Because these two sites are the first Socs1 binding sites to be described on receptors, it would be interesting to test whether Grb2 and/or p85 sites are also docking sites for Socs1 in other receptor tyrosine kinases. We have also shown that Socs1 was rapidly and transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to M-CSF, as described for other Fms-interacting molecules (17Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.-L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Socs2 and Socs3 tyrosine phosphorylation has recently been described in response to insulin-like growth factor and IL-2, respectively (43Dey B.R. Furlanetto R.W. Nissley P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 44Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The precise role and importance of Socs tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating its function is yet unknown. Concerning Socs1, it would be interesting to locate the phosphorylation site(s) and to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation also occurs in response to other signals and whether it affects such Socs1 functions as Janus kinase inhibition.The biological relevance of the interaction between Socs1 and M-CSF-R is supported by the fact that Socs1 expression resulted in a decreased M-CSF-dependent proliferation of two different cell lines, including the FDC-P1/MAC cells that express endogenous M-CSF-R and are a physiological model for Fms signaling (37Gliniak B.C. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Socs1 protein is unstable in cells, and Socs1 synthesis is strongly repressed at the translation level (45Gregorieff A. Pyronnet S. Sonnenberg N. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21596-21604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, endogenous Socs1 protein has so far been described only in mouse T lymphocytes after immunoprecipitation (45Gregorieff A. Pyronnet S. Sonnenberg N. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21596-21604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For this reason, we expressed Socs1 ectopically to study its functional interactions in vivo. Socs1 promoter expression has been detected in vivo in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (27Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Elefanty A.G. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Starr R. Mifsud S. Di Rago L. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that both M-CSF-R and Socs1 are coexpressed during monocytic development. Interestingly, Socs1 negatively regulated M-CSF-R proliferation signal only in the presence of nearly physiological limiting concentrations of M-CSF (46Tushinski R.J. Oliver I.T. Guilbert L.J. Tynan P.W. Warner J.R. Stanley E.R. Cell. 1982; 28: 71-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar).Altogether, our data suggest that Socs1 may act as a negative regulator of the M-CSF-R proliferation signal; there are different ways in which Socs1 could be involved in Fms signaling. First, M-CSF-R activates the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway in myeloid cells (47Novak U. Nice E. Hamilton J.A. Paradiso L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2607-2613PubMed Google Scholar); Socs1 recruitment by M-CSF-R could then specifically inhibit this pathway. Socs1 may also link the receptor to the ubiquitin machinery, as demonstrated for Vav (28De Sepulveda P. Ilangumaran S. Rottapel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which could occur through the interaction of the Socs box with ubiquitin ligase complexes. The present study also clearly shows that Socs1 does not equally affect proliferation signals of different receptors. Socs1 strongly suppressed IL-3 and SCF receptor signals, whereas its effects on M-CSF-R were less intense. In that respect, Socs1 offers an example of how a signaling molecule can differentially modify receptor signaling and thereby control the balance between self-renewal and commitment to differentiation. Finally, our experiments demonstrated that it is possible to obtain stable expression of Socs1 in IL-3- or SCF-dependent cell lines as long as they are maintained in the presence of high concentrations of M-CSF. Such cells represent valuable models for studying the early effects of Socs1 on other receptor signals after shifting the cells from M-CSF to other growth factor (e.g. IL-3 or SCF)-containing medium. In conclusion, our work provides the first evidence for a connection between M-CSF-R and Socs1, and we are now investigating the role of other members of the Socs family during monocyte development as controlled by M-CSF-R. In the present study, we have characterized the in vitro and in vivo interaction between Socs1 and Fms/M-CSF-R. In vivo interaction between Socs proteins and several receptor tyrosine kinases has been previously reported; Socs1 binds to both Kit and Flt3 (19De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rose J. Hawley R.G.

https://openalex.org/W2067720692,"Mutations in the aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel cause the hereditary renal disease nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). The missense mutation AQP2-T126M causes human recessive NDI by retention at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of renal epithelial cells. To determine whether the ER retention of AQP2-T126M is due to relative immobilization in the ER, we measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching the intramembrane mobility of green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras containing human wild-type and mutant AQP2. In transfected LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells, GFP-labeled AQP2-T126M was localized to the ER, and wild-type AQP2 to endosomes and the plasma membrane; both were localized to the ER after brefeldin A treatment. Photobleaching with image detection indicated that the GFP-AQP2 chimeras were freely mobile throughout the ER. Quantitative spot photobleaching revealed a diffusion-dependent irreversible process whose recovery depended on spot size and was abolished by paraformaldehyde fixation. In addition, a novel slow reversible fluorescence recovery (t 12∼2 s) was characterized whose recovery was independent of spot size and not affected by fixation. AQP2 translational diffusion in the ER was not slowed by the T126M mutation; diffusion coefficients were (in cm2/s × 10−10) 2.6 ± 0.5 (wild-type) and 3.0 ± 0.4 (T126M). Much faster diffusion was found for a lipid probe (diOC4(3), 2.7 × 10−8cm2/s) in the ER membrane and for unconjugated GFP in the aqueous ER lumen (6 × 10−8cm2/s). ER diffusion of GFP-T126M was not significantly affected by up-regulation of molecular chaperones, cAMP activation, or actin filament disruption. ATP depletion by 2-deoxyglucose and azide resulted in comparable slowing/immobilization of wild-type and T126M AQP2. These results indicate that the ER retention of AQP2-T126M does not result from restricted or slowed mobility and suggest that the majority of AQP2-T126M is not aggregated or bound to slowly moving membrane proteins.

The GFP label here did not affect AQP2 cellular localization, and it was found previously that GFP-labeled wild-type AQP2 had native tetrameric structure, water channel function, and regulated cellular trafficking (16Umenishi F. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1024-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Diffusion of wild-type and mutant AQP2 were compared quantitatively, and the effects were characterized of a series of maneuvers to modify putative AQP2 interactions. The results here provide the first information about the ER retention mechanism of a naturally occurring mutation in a membrane protein associated with human disease. During the course of our experiments, a paper by Nehls et al. (17Nehls S. Snapp E.L. Cole N.B. Zaal K.J. Kenworthy A.H. Roberts T.H. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) was published on the ER mobility of a temperature-sensitive folding mutant of the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSVG) protein. Although some conclusions about VSVG and AQP2 mobility at the ER are similar, there are substantial differences in ER diffusion rates and interactions with molecular chaperones (see “Discussion”). Missense point mutant T126M of human AQP2 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequence analysis. The cDNAs encoding wild-type and mutant AQP2 were fused downstream from EGFP (CLONTECH) as described previously for wild-type AQP2 (16Umenishi F. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1024-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells (obtained from the University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture Facility) were grown at 37 °C in a 5‥ CO2/95‥ air atmosphere using DMEH-21 medium. Cells were cultured on 18 mm-diameter round coverglasses in 12-well dishes in DMEH-21 medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. For some studies cells were transiently transfected with the GFP-labeled AQP2-T126M mutant by overnight incubation with DMEH-21 medium containing 1 μg of plasmid and 6 μl of EffecteneTM (Qiagen) per well. LLC-PK1 cells were also transfected with unconjugated EGFP in the cytoplasm as described by Kneen et al. (18Kneen M. Farinas J. Li Y. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1591-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) and in the ER as described by Dayelet al. (14Dayel M. Hom E.F. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In some experiments ER membranes were stained with 3,3′-dibutyloxacarbocyanine iodide (diOC4 (3Deen P.M. Verkijk M.A. Knoers N.V. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A. van Os C.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), Molecular Probes) by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C using 10 μm dye concentration. Transfected cells were cultured on glass coverslips until near confluence and mounted in a custom-built closed perfusion chamber designed to fit in a PDMI-2 microincubator (Harvard Apparatus). Perfusion chamber temperature was controlled by a TC-201A temperature regulator (Harvard Apparatus) and objective temperature by a lens thermoregulator (Bioptechs Inc., Butler, PA). Photobleaching measurements were performed at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. Cell cultures were generally perfused with phosphate-buffered saline containing 6 mmd-glucose at 1 ml/min, and photobleaching measurements were made within 1 h of mounting the cells in the perfusion chamber. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with brefeldin A (1 μg/ml, 16 h, 37 °C) to give AQP2 localization in the ER. In some experiments cells were incubated with the fixative paraformaldehyde (4‥, 30 min, 23 °C), the metabolic inhibitors 2-deoxy-d-glucose (50 mm, 1 h, 37 °C) and sodium azide (0.05‥) (for ATP depletion), the cAMP agonist forskolin (50 μm, 15 min, 37 °C), or the cytoskeleton-disrupting agent cytochalasin D (5 μg/ml, 45 min, 37 °C). Some cell cultures were heat-shocked by incubation at 42 °C for 1 h followed by 16-h incubation at 37 °C. Photobleaching measurements were carried out on an apparatus described previously (19Kao H.P. Verkman A.S. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 59: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with modification. For spot photobleaching, an argon ion laser beam (488 nm, Innova 70–4; Coherent) was modulated by an acousto-optic modulator (Primrose) and directed onto the transfected cells through an objective using a Nikon inverted epifluorescence microscope (Diaphot). For cell visualization and selection of the spot to be bleached, full-field epi-illumination was accomplished using the defocused undiffracted beam delivered by a fiberoptic. The full-field and nondefocused laser beams were reflected by a dichroic mirror (510 nm) onto the sample using oil immersion objective lenses (Nikon oil Fluors; 100×, N.A. 1.4 or 40×, N.A. 1.3). Sample fluorescence was filtered by a 530-nm interference filter, detected using a photomultiplier, and digitized by a 14-bit analog-to-digital converter. The photomultiplier was transiently gated off during the bleach pulse by reducing the voltage of the second dynode. Fluorescence was sampled over 1 s before the bleach pulse, then at rates of up to 1 MHz. For measurement of slow recoveries, an electronic shutter was used to collect average fluorescence every 0.5 s or slower. Each fluorescence value was the average of 10,000 samples collected during the shutter open time of 20 ms. For photobleaching experiments with image detection, a Nikon upright microscope with cooled CCD camera detector (Photometrics) was used to record full-field fluorescence images. An electronically shuttered bleach beam from the argon laser was directed onto the sample from below using a Nikon 25× extra long working distance air objective. Cells were viewed from above by epifluorescence using a 60× oil immersion objective and GFP filter set (HQ filters, Chroma). Software was written to coordinate the bleach pulse, excitation and camera shutters, and image acquisition. Recovery half-time (t 12), defined as the time when fluorescence recovered by 50‥ due to diffusion, was determined from fluorescence recovery curves, F(t), using a multiple-component regression. Fluorescence recovery was treated as a combination of reversible and irreversible processes: F(t) = a1[F(t)reversible] + a2[F(t)irreversible], where a1+a2 = 1.F(t)reversible was fitted by nonlinear least square exponential regression usingF(t) measured in paraformaldehyde-fixed cells. The diffusion-mediated recovery was fitted using the semiempirical equation: F(t)irreversible =F o + [F o + R(Finf −F o )](t/t 12)/[1 + (t/ t 12a)], where F o is pre-bleach fluorescence, F inf is fluorescence at infinite time, and R is the fractional fluorescence recovery (20Periasamy N. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For each maneuver, recovery curves were measured on at least 40 different cells using three or more sets of cultures generated on different days. Parameters are reported as mean ± S.E., where sets of six individual recovery curves were averaged and fitted to establish statistics. Absolute diffusion coefficients (D, cm2/s) were calculated from t 12 using a mathematical model of ER diffusion (15Ölveczky B.P. Periasamy N. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2836-2847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in which the effective spot size of the bleached region was determined each day using thin layers of solution standards (fluorescein in saline) as described previously (20Periasamy N. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Kao H.P. Abney J.R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Measurements were done on transfected LLC-PK1 cells expressing wild-type and T126M AQP2 proteins fused downstream from a GFP reporter. Fig. 1 A shows the cDNA constructs, indicating the amino acid sequence at the GFP-AQP2 fusion site and the location of the T126M mutation. Fig. 1 B shows confocal fluorescence micrographs of cells expressing the GFP-AQP2 constructs. Without brefeldin A treatment, GFP-labeled AQP2-T126M was localized in the ER (left) and wild-type AQP2 in endosomes and the plasma membrane (middle). After incubation with forskolin for 15 min, GFP-labeled wild-type AQP2 was seen mainly at the plasma membrane, whereas the localization of AQP2-T126M was unchanged (data not shown). After treatment with brefeldin-A, which partially collapses the Golgi and prevents ER-to-Golgi vesicle traffic, both GFP-AQP2 chimeras showed the characteristic ER staining pattern (wild-type AQP2 shown at right), as also seen in cells expressing KDEL-tagged unconjugated GFP or stained with cyanine diOC4 (3Deen P.M. Verkijk M.A. Knoers N.V. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A. van Os C.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) (not shown). Photobleaching studies of GFP-AQP2 diffusion in the ER were carried out on brefeldin A-treated cells or cells expressing AQP2-T126M without brefeldin A treatment. Photobleaching imaging experiments were done to examine the continuity of the ER membrane and to determine whether GFP-labeled AQP2-T126M is restricted in its ER mobility. A large region of the cell was bleached by the laser pulse. Fig. 1 C shows pre-bleach and a series of post-bleach images of brefeldin A-treated LLC-PK1 cells expressing wild-type GFP-AQP2. The post-bleach image showed a darkened region corresponding to the site of the bleach pulse. There was progressive recovery of fluorescence over the first ∼50 s. At 200 s, the ER was similar in appearance to the pre-bleach image, except for reduced intensity as a consequence of the substantial fraction of total cell GFP-AQP2 that was irreversibly bleached. Similar results for many different cells, different laser spot sizes, and different bleached regions of the cell indicated that with respect to diffusion of wild-type AQP2 the ER membrane is continuously connected throughout the cell. Similar findings were reported previously for unconjugated GFP in the aqueous lumen of ER, albeit with a substantially faster rate of diffusion (14Dayel M. Hom E.F. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Imaging photobleaching experiments were also done on cells expressing AQP2-T126M. Examination of serial images from many cells (representative example in Fig. 1 D) showed that the GFP-labeled AQP2-T126M protein was able to move freely throughout the ER, with qualitatively comparable fluorescence recovery kinetics to wild-type AQP2. Spot photobleaching measurements were done to characterize quantitatively the fluorescence recovery processes and to compare the diffusion of GFP-labeled wild-type AQP2 and AQP2-T126M. GFP fluorescence in a small spot was bleached: ∼0.7-μm diameter produced by a 100× oil immersion objective, or ∼2-μm diameter produced by a 40× objective. Bleach times were selected to reduce fluorescence intensity just after the bleach to ∼60‥ of initial fluorescence. Initial experiments done using a 100× objective showed nearly complete fluorescence recovery in a few seconds in brefeldin A-treated cells expressing GFP-labeled wild-type AQP2 (Fig.2 A, top curve). “No bleach” control experiments were done for each set of studies to prove that the attenuated probe beam did not produce bleaching. To confirm that the recovery corresponded to diffusion, measurements were done after paraformaldehyde treatment (to immobilize GFP-AQP2) and using a 40× lens (to increase spot diameter and slow diffusion-related recovery ∼ [100/40]2 ∼ 6-fold). Interestingly, partial recovery was seen in paraformaldehyde-fixed cells with an exponential time constant, τ, of 3.4 ± 0.8 s (second curve). Fluorescence recovery in the absence of diffusion defines a reversible recovery process, as created by triplet state or other photophysical relaxation processes. For example, the decay of a GFP molecule from an excited triplet state to the ground state would produce fluorescence recovery because of restoration of the population of excitable GFP molecules. Reversible GFP fluorescence recovery has been described (14Dayel M. Hom E.F. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 22Swaminathan R. Hoang C.P. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), albeit at a much faster rate (1–5 ms, depending on construct), and slow GFP flickering has been reported (23Haupts U. Maiti S. Schwille P. Webb W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Examination of the early fluorescence time course after bleaching in the paraformaldehyde-treated cells revealed a second apparent reversible recovery process (τ ∼ 4 ms) of low amplitude (inset). In addition to insensitivity to fixation, diffusion-independent reversible fluorescence recovery processes do not depend on spot size. The recovery of the slow reversible process was not affected by increasing objective spot diameter ∼2.5-fold (third curve) in the paraformaldehyde-treated cells (3.0 ± 0.5 s), confirming reversible recovery. Similar results were obtained using a 10× objective to illuminate whole cells (not shown). The remaining recovery after the reversible process seen for the first curve in Fig. 2 A was diffusion-dependent, as shown by its disappearance after paraformaldehyde treatment (second curve) and its significant slowing when bleached and viewed with a larger spot size (t 12∼ 12 s, fourth curve). The slow reversible fluorescence recovery processes for GFP-AQP2 were not noted previously for GFP in cytoplasm, where recovery was measured over much shorter times (22Swaminathan R. Hoang C.P. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows a series of photobleaching measurements similar to those in Fig. 2 A, but for unconjugated GFP in the cytoplasm of LLC-PK1 cells. The top curve shows substantially faster fluorescence recovery of the free GFP in aqueous-phase cytoplasm compared with membrane diffusion of GFP-AQP2. The second and third curves, where GFP mobility was abolished by paraformaldehyde fixation, shows recovery similar to that seen for GFP-AQP2 in paraformaldehyde-fixed cells in Fig. 2 A (τ, 3–5 s). The fourth curve shows that the irreversible (diffusion-dependent) fluorescence recovery process was strongly dependent on spot size as anticipated (t 1210 ms, 100× versus 57 ms, 40×). Thus the slow (3–5 s) reversible recovery process seen for GFP-AQP2 does not appear to be context-specific. Quantitative spot photobleaching experiments were done to compare the ER membrane diffusion of GFP-labeled wild-type AQP2 and AQP2-T126M. It was postulated that interactions of the mutant ER-retained protein with components of the quality control machinery might result in slowed diffusion. Fig. 3 A shows representative fluorescence recovery data, and Fig. 3 Bsummarizes averaged diffusion coefficients. Qualitatively the recovery curves for the brefeldin A-treated GFP-labeled wild-type and mutant AQP2 were similar, as was the recovery curve for AQP2-T126M in non-brefeldin A-treated cells. The averaged diffusion coefficients did not differ significantly. Fitted percentage recoveries were generally >90‥, indicating that nearly all AQP2 is mobile, in agreement with the conclusion from the image photobleaching studies in Fig. 1,C and D. In addition a series of experiments were done at 23 °C. Although the absolute diffusion coefficients were lower than those at 37 °C, there was no significant effect of the T126M mutation. The computation of absolute diffusion coefficients relied on a Monte-Carlo random walk model, which takes into account the reticular geometry of the ER and relates diffusion coefficients to fluorescence recovery kinetics (15Ölveczky B.P. Periasamy N. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2836-2847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Previously this model was used to compute the diffusion coefficient of unconjugated GFP in the aqueous lumen of the ER (14Dayel M. Hom E.F. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A similar experiment was done to measure the diffusion of unconjugated GFP in the ER lumen of the LLC-PK1 cells used here. GFP fluorescence recovered much faster (Fig. 3 A, bottom curve), with a diffusion coefficient of (6.0 ± 0.7) × 10−8 cm2/s (Fig. 3 B), in agreement with that of 5–10 × 10−8cm2/s for GFP diffusion in the ER of CHO cells. The 200-fold lower diffusion coefficient for GFP-AQP2 indicates the remarkably slowed diffusion of integral membrane proteins compared with aqueous-phase macromolecules. ER membrane diffusion of GFP-labeled AQP2-T126M was measured in response to a series of cell treatments designed to modulate AQP2 phosphorylation state (forskolin), interactions with molecular chaperones (ATP metabolic depletion and heat shock), and interactions with cytoskeleton (cytochalasin D). Fig.4 A shows representative fluorescence recovery curves for cells expressing GFP-labeled AQP2-T126M, with averaged diffusion coefficients for a series of measurements summarized in Fig. 4 C. There was no significant effect of forskolin treatment, heat shock, or cytochalasin treatment on AQP2-T126M diffusion coefficients or mobilities. However, ATP depletion by 2-deoxyglucose and azide produced a small but significant slowing of diffusion, as well as a decrease in the mobile fraction (percentage fluorescence recovery) from >90‥ to 64 ± 7‥. To determine whether the effect of ATP depletion was specific for AQP2-T126M, similar measurements were done on GFP-labeled wild-type AQP2 (Fig.4 B). ATP depletion produced similar slowing and reduced mobility of GFP-labeled wild-type AQP2 and unconjugated GFP. ATP depletion also caused a significant reduction in the mobility of unconjugated GFP in the ER lumen (Fig. 4 B, middle curves). To distinguish between an effect of ATP depletion on ER “crowding,” as proposed by Nehls et al. (17Nehls S. Snapp E.L. Cole N.B. Zaal K.J. Kenworthy A.H. Roberts T.H. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar),versus ER restructuring and geometric differences, the diffusion of a small lipophilic ER membrane probe, diOC4(3), was measured. Fig. 4, B (bottom curves) and C, showed no effect of ATP depletion on diOC4(3) diffusion, indicating that ATP depletion does not affect ER geometry in a manner that influences the relationship between fluorescence recovery and molecular diffusion. The principal conclusion of this study is that despite its retention at the endoplasmic reticulum, the human disease causing AQP2 mutant T126M is not slowed in its translational diffusion in the ER compared with wild-type AQP2. Both wild-type AQP2 and AQP2-T126M diffused freely throughout the ER without restrictions. Furthermore, AQP2-T126M diffusion was not changed significantly by maneuvers designed to modulate AQP2 phosphorylation and interactions with components of the cellular quality control machinery and the actin skeleton. Therefore slowed or restricted ER membrane diffusion of AQP2-T126M cannot account for its efficient retention in the ER. Formally our results indicate that the rate-limiting step for the ER diffusion of AQP2 is not sensitive to the T126M mutation. It is noted that interactions between AQP2-T126M and soluble macromolecules are unlikely to be detected by diffusion measurements, because the diffusion of intramembrane proteins is orders of magnitudes slower than that of aqueous-phase macromolecules. For example, the binding of large 30-nm diameter gold beads does not slow the diffusion of much smaller membrane receptors (24Lee G.M. Zhang F. Ishihara A. McNeil C.L. Jacobson K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The quantitatively comparable diffusion of wild-type AQP2 and AQP2-T126M makes unlikely significant AQP2-T126M aggregation or interactions with intramembrane structures that have diffusive rates comparable with or slower than AQP2. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of slowing or immobilization of a small fraction (<5–10‥) of AQP2-T126M molecules that cannot be resolved by the photobleaching recovery measurements. The approach here utilized fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of GFP-labeled AQP2 chimeras. The relatively polar GFP moiety is unlikely to affect the membrane diffusion of AQP2. We showed previously that GFP labeling did not alter the water permeability or tetrameric intramembrane structure of AQP1 and AQP2 (16Umenishi F. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1024-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), or the regulated membrane trafficking of AQP2 (25Gustafson C.E. Levine S. Katsura T. McLaughlin M. Aleixo M.D. Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the diffusion of GFP-labeled wild-type AQP2 at the plasma membrane was remarkably slowed by cAMP-induced phosphorylation of serine 256 in the AQP2 C terminus domain (16Umenishi F. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1024-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The cAMP-induced slowing of AQP2 mobility at the plasma membrane was abolished by mutation of the phosphorylation site at serine 256 to alanine, and by cytochalasin D disruption of the actin skeleton. In the experiments here, cAMP agonists and cytochalasin D treatment did not affect AQP2 mobility in the ER. Although we have not determined whether the AQP2 C terminus can be phosphorylated in the ER, the results suggest that ER-associated AQP2 does not interact directly or indirectly with the actin skeleton. Recent two-hybrid experiments have identified a number of putative proteins that interact with the phosphorylated C terminus of AQP2 (26Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 23AGoogle Scholar). The data here represent the first study of the mobility of a disease-causing mutant membrane protein that produces a defective cell phenotype by ER retention. It will be interesting to determine the generality of the conclusions here to other mutant membrane proteins, such as the ΔF508-CFTR protein that is retained at the ER and causes the disease cystic fibrosis. In agreement with the conclusion here, Nehls et al. (17Nehls S. Snapp E.L. Cole N.B. Zaal K.J. Kenworthy A.H. Roberts T.H. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) reported that the diffusion of GFP-labeled VSVG was unimpeded, so that its ER retention was not the consequence of slowed mobility. However, their diffusion coefficient for VSVG was 10-fold greater than that of AQP2 found here, and the temperature-sensitive unfolded VSVG was largely immobilized after cellular ATP depletion, which allowed a stable interaction with BiP. Comparative studies of folded and unfolded VSVG required measurements at 32 °C (with brefeldin A treatment) and 40 °C, respectively. We find here that the diffusion of wild-type and mutant AQP2 in renal epithelial cells at 37 °C was not quantitatively different following ATP depletion or up-regulation of molecular chaperones by temperature shock. It is likely that fundamentally different mechanisms apply for the recognition of unfolded VSVG versus mutant AQP2. For VSVG interactions with BiP, protein disulfide isomerase, and calnexin have been reported, whereas thus far it has not been possible to detect an interaction between mutant AQP2 and known components of the quality control machinery. The diffusion coefficients of AQP2 and AQP2-T126M at the ER, ∼3 × 10−10 cm2/s, are a few-fold greater than that of wild-type AQP1 or AQP2 at the plasma membrane (∼0.9 × 10−10 cm2/s at 37 °C), which is consistent with the relatively low cholesterol content and high membrane fluidity of the ER. The ER diffusion of AQP2 was similar to another ER protein, cytochrome P450 (2.6–6.2 × 10−10 cm2/s) (27Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C.D. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14793-14798Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but much less than that reported for VSVG (4–6 × 10−9 cm2/s) (17Nehls S. Snapp E.L. Cole N.B. Zaal K.J. Kenworthy A.H. Roberts T.H. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To date the diffusional mobilities of other ER proteins have not been reported. For comparison, unconjugated GFP in the aqueous-phase ER lumen diffused substantially faster (6 × 10−8cm2/s) than membrane-bound GFP chimeras. The small lipid probe diOC4 (3Deen P.M. Verkijk M.A. Knoers N.V. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A. van Os C.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) in the ER membrane also diffused substantially faster (3 × 10−8cm2/s), in agreement with previous measurements of the diffusion of fluorescently labeled phospholipids (28Lee G.M. Ishihara A. Jacobson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6274-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). An important unresolved issue is how proteins like AQP2-T126M are retained at the ER. AQP2-T126M does not contain a classical ER retention sequence (like KKXX), and wild-type AQP2 efficiently exits the ER. No evidence was found for a population of AQP2-T126M that was discontinuous from the ER, providing further evidence that retrieval from a downstream compartment is not the mechanism of its ER retention. The photobleaching results indicate that AQP2-T126M aggregation or interactions (transient or sustained) with slowly moving membrane components cannot account for its ER retention. The ER may contain specialized membrane domains that bud off during the formation of vesicles destined to fuse with the Golgi. The AQP2-T126M protein might be excluded from these specialized submicroscopic domains because of misfolding and inability to be recognized by as yet unidentified proteins responsible for accumulation in transport vesicles (29Klumperman J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The identification of ER retention mechanisms of disease-causing protein mutations remains a major challenge."

https://openalex.org/W2024209857,"The H2O2-dependent reaction of lactoperoxidase (LPO) with sperm whale myoglobin (SwMb) or horse myoglobin (HoMb) produces LPO-Mb cross-linked species, in addition to LPO and SwMb homodimers. The HoMb products are a LPO(HoMb) dimer and LPO(HoMb)2 trimer. Dityrosine cross-links are shown by their fluorescence to be present in the oligomeric products. Addition of H2O2 to myoglobin (Mb), followed by catalase to quench excess H2O2 before the addition of LPO, still yields LPO cross-linked products. LPO oligomerization therefore requires radical transfer from Mb to LPO. In contrast to native LPO, recombinant LPO undergoes little self-dimerization in the absence of Mb but occurs normally in its presence. Simultaneous addition of 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid (DBNBS) and LPO to activated Mb produces a spin-trapped radical electron paramagnetic resonance signal located primarily on LPO, confirming the radical transfer. Mutation of Tyr-103 or Tyr-151 in SwMb decreased cross-linking with LPO, but mutation of Tyr-146, Trp-7, or Trp-14 did not. However, because DBNBS-trapped LPO radicals were observed with all the mutants, DBNBS traps LPO radicals other than those involved in protein oligomerization. The results clearly establish that radical transfer occurs from Mb to LPO and suggest that intermolecularly transferred radicals may reside on residues other than those that are generated by intramolecular reactions. The H2O2-dependent reaction of lactoperoxidase (LPO) with sperm whale myoglobin (SwMb) or horse myoglobin (HoMb) produces LPO-Mb cross-linked species, in addition to LPO and SwMb homodimers.

Mutation of Tyr-103 or Tyr-151 in SwMb decreased cross-linking with LPO, but mutation of Tyr-146, Trp-7, or Trp-14 did not. However, because DBNBS-trapped LPO radicals were observed with all the mutants, DBNBS traps LPO radicals other than those involved in protein oligomerization. The results clearly establish that radical transfer occurs from Mb to LPO and suggest that intermolecularly transferred radicals may reside on residues other than those that are generated by intramolecular reactions. myoglobin metmyoglobin horse myoglobin sperm whale myoglobin iron protoporphyrin IX regardless of the oxidation and ligation states lactoperoxidase recombinant LPO 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid electron paramagnetic resonance 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pressure liquid chromatography Amino acid centered radicals are now established as catalytic intermediates in a variety of enzymes, including cytochromec peroxidase (1Sivaraja M.

Both the catalytic and incidental protein radicals are most commonly generated by a metal-catalyzed reaction within the protein itself, but the formation of protein radicals by reaction of the protein with an exogenous species such as the hydroxyl radical is also known (14Fancy D. Kodadek T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Garrison W.M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 381-398Crossref Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Protein radicals, particularly those not intrinsic to the catalytic mechanism, can lead to cross-linking of the protein, cleavage of the protein backbone, and the formation of protein peroxy radicals and protein peroxides (16Davies M.J. Fu S. Wang H. Dean R.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1151-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). These radical reactions can be physiologically relevant, as in the formation of a tyrosine-cross-linked protective shell by sea urchin ovoperoxidase (17Foerder C.A Shapiro B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4214-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In most situations, however, protein radicals facilitate pathological or toxicological processes (18Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Despite their importance, the factors and mechanisms that control the formation, localization, delocalization, and propagation of protein free radicals remain obscure. The reactions of sperm whale and horse heart MetMb with H2O2 have served as a useful model for the investigation of protein radicals. The early observation by EPR of a protein radical in the reaction of MetMb with H2O2 has been more precisely defined by recent work (12Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8827-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Degray J.A. Gunther M.R. Tschirret-Guth R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2359-2362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis, in conjunction with protein digestion, peptide sequencing, mass spectrometry, and EPR spectroscopy, has established that MetMb cross-linking involves the formation of Tyr-103 and Tyr-151 dityrosine cross-links (10Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Tyr-146, the third tyrosine in the protein, forms a radical, but it may not participate in chemical reactions (13Rao S. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 803-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the two tryptophan residues, Trp-7 and Trp-14, only Trp-14 appears to be involved in the formation of a protein-peroxy radical that can co-oxidize styrene (13Rao S. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 803-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Degray J.A. Gunther M.R. Tschirret-Guth R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2359-2362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Evidence has also been obtained for the formation of a radical located on Cys-110 (20Witting P.K Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20391-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which is unique to human myoglobin, and on an aliphatic MetMb amino acid residue (21Fenwick C.W. English A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12236-12237Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All of these protein radicals are associated with the formation of a ferryl (FeIV=O) species in the reaction of MetMb with H2O2. Recent work indicates that the reaction of MetMb with H2O2 initially yields a transient Compound I-like species, in which the ferryl is coupled to a porphyrin rather than a protein radical (22Matsui T. Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9952-9957Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34858-34866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the protein radical is generated by subsequent rapid electron transfer from the protein to the porphyrin radical. The residue that provides the electron that directly quenches the porphyrin radical is not known, but the resulting protein radical appears to transfer efficiently from one residue to another over considerable distances. Thus, radical reactions involving Tyr-103, Tyr-151, Trp-14, Cys-110 (human Mb only), and Lys-42 have been identified, and mutation of any one of these residues only suppresses the reactions at that specific site. Furthermore, the Tyr-151 radical is still formed, even though the closest Tyr-151 ring carbon is 12 Å from the heme iron, when Tyr-103 and Tyr-146, which are closer to the heme, have been mutated to phenylalanines. A relay mechanism for dispersal of the free radical center is therefore not a prerequisite for radical formation at a distal residue in MetMb. LPO, a mammalian peroxidase, catalyzes the physiologically relevant oxidation of thiocyanide to antibacterial products, as well as the oxidation of iodide, bromide, and conventional peroxidase substrates such as ABTS and guaiacol (24Thomas E.L. Pruitt K.M. Tenovuo J.O. The Lactoperoxidase System: Chemistry and Biological Significance. Marcel Dekker, New York1985: 31-54Google Scholar). Its catalytic mechanism involves reaction with H2O2 to form a Compound I species with a FeIV=O ferryl species and a porphyrin radical cation. This initial Compound I decays to a second Compound I species in which the FeIV=O is paired with a protein radical (25Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999: 20Google Scholar,26Courtin F. Michot J.-L. Virion A. Pommier J. Deme D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that formation of the protein radical form of the activated enzyme leads to dimerization of LPO through the formation of a dityrosine cross-link involving residue Tyr-289 in each of two enzyme molecules (27Lardinois O.M. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35441-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Spin trapping/EPR evidence was also obtained for the formation of protein radicals at sites other than the tyrosine involved in the cross-linking reaction (27Lardinois O.M. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35441-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The roles of these protein radicals in LPO function remain unclear, although a previous study has argued that the protein radicals may be required for certain catalytic functions (26Courtin F. Michot J.-L. Virion A. Pommier J. Deme D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and autocatalytic covalent binding of the prosthetic heme group to the LPO protein can be formulated as a radical process (28Depillis G.D. Ozaki S.-I. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8857-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the evidence is more sparse than that for MetMb, it appears that the protein radical undergoes some degree of dispersion throughout the LPO structure, but it is not known whether this dispersion is an equilibrium or unidirectional process. As indicated by the work with MetMb and LPO, protein radicals delocalize readily, even to distant sites within a protein, once they are generated at a well-defined site, i.e. in the vicinity of the heme iron atom. In this study, we have investigated whether the protein radicals thus generated can transfer from one protein to another and whether this mechanism of radical propagation can produce protein radicals in the second protein distinct from those formed by radical generation within the protein itself. SwMb, HoMb, equine apomyoglobin, and LPO from bovine milk were acquired from Sigma. The commercial LPO (80–150 units/mg protein;A412/A280 = 0.88–0.95) shown to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE was desalted over prepacked Sephadex G-25 (PD-10) gel filtration cartridges before use. The commercial SwMb and HoMb were further purified by chromatography on a (2.6 × 100-cm) Sephacryl S-200 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated and run at 0.5 ml/min in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Prepacked Sephadex G-25 (PD-10) gel filtration cartridges were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 1E UV-visible spectrometer (Varian, Victoria, Australia). Dityrosine content was measured with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50 B fluorimeter (Beaconsfield, United Kingdom). SDS-PAGE was done on a Pharmacia LKB Phast System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EPR measurements were performed with an ER/200D EPR spectrometer from Brucker, Inc. (Billerica, MA). Circular dichroism was measured with a J-710 spectropolarimeter from Jasco (Tokyo, Japan). The mutant SwMb proteins and wild-type recombinant rLPO were expressed and purified as described previously (12Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8827-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rao S. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Recombinant SwMb proteins were oxidized to the met form using a slight excess of K3Fe(CN)6 and then passed over a PD-10 column eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The protein samples were then further purified by chromatography on a (2.6 × 100-cm) Sephacryl S-200 HR column and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon YM 10; Amicon; molecular weight cut off = 10,000) before use. The column was equilibrated and run as described for the native protein (see above). The far ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra of wild-type and mutant Mb proteins at pH 6.8 were fully superimposable (data not shown). In all of the SwMb tyrosine and tryptophan mutants examined, the UV-visible spectra observed were nearly identical to those of the native protein, indicating that changes to the structure in the vicinity of the heme iron were minimal (data not shown). Peroxidase activities were determined with ABTS as the reducing substrate (29Childs R.E. Bardsley W.E. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Formation of the ABTS radical cation was monitored at 414 nm (εABTS·, 414 = 36 mm−1 cm−1; assay conditions: 100 μm ABTS, 100 μmH2O2, and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5). Enzyme concentrations were estimated by measuring the absorbance of the heme Soret band using the following extinction coefficients: εLPO, 412 = 112.3 mm−1cm−1 (30Ohlsson P.-I. Paul K.-G. Acta Chem. Scand. 1983; 37: 917-921Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), SwMb εMetMb, 409 = 157 mm−1 cm−1 (31Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. Elsevier, New York1971: 44Google Scholar), and HoMb εMetMb, 409 = 188 mm−1cm−1 (31Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. Elsevier, New York1971: 44Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments were carried out at 25 °C for 5 min. The reactions were terminated by addition of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were allowed to stand in SDS for 10 min and heated at 100 °C for 2 min before loading onto the gels, which were developed and then stained with Coomassie Blue. A stock solution of 72 μm LPO and 741 μm HoMb was prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The LPO-HoMb stock solution was incubated with H2O2 at a final concentration of 1 mm for 5 min at 25 °C. Excess H2O2 was then consumed by incubation with catalase (1.25 units/ml) for 15 min. The resulting solution was applied to a 2.6 × 20-cm SP Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8. The column was washed with 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and then eluted using the stepwise procedure described in the text (0–450 mm NaCl). The fractions corresponding to LPO-HoMb heteromers (as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis) were pooled in two lots. Each lot was desalted and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon YM 30; Amicon; molecular weight cut off = 30,000). The concentrated samples contained about 4 mg total protein/ml and were stored at 4 °C for subsequent analysis. A 100-μl sample of each fraction of heteromers separated by cation-exchange chromatography was taken for analysis. The samples were diluted to a volume of 2 ml with 8 m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 2 mm CaCl2 before they were concentrated down to 100 μl by diafiltration (Centricon YM 30; Amicon). After adding 20 μl of 50 mm dithiothreitol, the samples were incubated at 60 °C for 60 min. The resulting mixtures were then diluted to 380 μl with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 2 mm CaCl2 and treated with Pronase (1:10, w/w) for 24 h and leucine aminopeptidase (1:25, w/w) for 12 h at 37 °C. The hydrolyzed samples were frozen and stored at −70 °C for subsequent analysis. A dityrosine standard or LPO-Mb hydrolysate samples were injected onto a Vydac 218TP54, 4.6 × 250-mm, C18 reverse phase HPLC column. The column was eluted with a linear gradient rising from 100% solvent A to 10% solvent B in 45 min (solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). A rapid gradient to 90% solvent B and then back to 100% solvent A was then run to regenerate the column. The eluent was monitored with a UV-visible detector set at 280 nm. Fluorescent compounds were detected with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650-10S fluorescence spectrophotometer (λex = 280 nm, λem = 410 nm) coupled in-line with the HPLC system. Dityrosine was prepared using the enzymatic method of Amadò et al. (32Amadò R. Aeschbach R. Neukom H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and purified by reverse phase HPLC as described previously (27Lardinois O.M. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35441-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). EPR measurements were performed with an ER/200D EPR spectrometer operating at 9.80 GHz with a TM cavity. X-Band, first derivative absorption spectra were obtained with the following settings: microwave power, 25 mW; center field, 3480 gauss; time constant, 100 ms; sweep time, 50 s; modulation, 0.32 millitesla at a frequency of 100 kHz; and total sweep width, 125 gauss. Spectra were taken at 18 °C to 22 °C. The magnetic field range and center were estimated by comparing the EPR spectrum from a LPO/H2O2 reaction mixture with that of the stable nitroso compound potassium nitrosodisulfonate. The potassium nitrosodisulfonate splitting was taken to be 13.091 gauss, and the center peak was taken to correspond to a g of 2.0056 (33Kooser R.G. Volland W.V. Freed J.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1969; 50: 5243-5250Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The reactions were all performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate solution (pH 6.8) containing 200 μmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to inhibit possible catalysis by trace transition metals. Fig. 1 shows the profile of mixtures of LPO and MetMb on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel after incubation with H2O2. Two types of Mb, HoMb and SwMb, were utilized. As already known (12Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8827-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rao S. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

When the HoMb-LPO mixtures were exposed to H2O2, two new bands occurred at positions corresponding to Mr 97,000 and Mr 127,000 (Fig. 1 A, lane 6), suggesting the formation of two types of heteromers, a dimer (LPO-Mb) and a trimer (LPO(Mb)2), respectively. Traces of two or three closely spaced bands of Mr∼200,000, likely due to (LPO)2 homodimers and possibly also due to (LPO)2-Mb heterotrimers, were also present. One additional band was obtained with a molecular weight of ∼153,000 using SwMb in place of HoMb (Fig. 1 B, lane 6) suggesting the formation of a LPO(Mb)3heterotetramer. These dimeric and oligomeric entities could not be attributed to S-S bond formation because (a) the protein samples were treated with 2-mercaptoethanol before electrophoresis, and (b) there are no cysteine residues in SwMb or HoMb. Inclusion of HoMb in the LPO/H2O2 system both decreased LPO homodimer and homotrimer formation and increased LPO-HoMb hetero-oligomerization in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). This suggests that HoMb competes with the two residues on the LPO surface involved in homotrimer formation. Heteromer formation increases to a maximum using reaction mixtures containing 1:40:40 stoichiometric concentrations of LPO, Mb, and H2O2, respectively (data not shown). No heteromer was observed by SDS-PAGE in incubations of apo-HoMb, LPO, and H2O2 (data not shown). Significant hetero-oligomerization only occurred when ferric HoMb or ferric SwMb was incubated with H2O2 in the presence of LPO.Figure 2Cross-linking between HoMb and LPO : effect of the amount of HoMb added. Lane 1, LPO; lane 2, LPO + H2O2; lanes 3–6, HoMb + LPO + H2O2. The following concentrations were used: [H2O2] = 125 μm;[LPO] = 10 μm; [HoMb] = 47 μm(lane 3), 94 μm (lane 4), 188 μm (lane 5), and 375 μm(lane 6); and [polyacrylamide] = 7.5%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The LPO-HoMb heteromers were separated by chromatography on a cationic exchange column (SP Sepharose Fast Flow). A typical elution pattern (Fig. 3 A) indicates the presence of three major protein components (peaks 1–3) and several minor components. One of the minor components is the LPO homodimer, which elutes at ∼170 ml (Fig. 3 A). The fraction corresponding to the earliest eluting major peak (peak 1) contained only HoMb and was not investigated further. The fractions corresponding to peaks 2 and 3 were pooled individually and desalted and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The molecular weights and the purities of the resulting solutions were determined on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig.3 B). As shown, peak 2 yielded two bands with apparent molecular weights of 108,000 and 130,000, which are consistent with the LPO-HoMb heterodimer and the LPO(HoMb)2heterotrimer, respectively. Peak 3 also yielded two bands, one of which was of higher molecular weight than that of native LPO and corresponded to the LPO-HoMb heterodimer at Mr97,000. The reactions of some hemoproteins with H2O2are known to result in oligomerization of the proteins due to the formation of tyrosine-tyrosine cross-links (10Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Spangler D.S. Erman J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 872: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8752-8759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dityrosine cross-links can be detected by their characteristic ultraviolet fluorescence (36Andersen S.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1966; 66 Suppl. 263: 1-81Google Scholar, 37Gross A.J. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1611-1614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the presence of dityrosine cross-links between LPO and Mb, the fractions corresponding to peaks 2 and 3 were pooled individually, desalted, and concentrated by ultrafiltration as described above. They were then digested with Pronase and leucine aminopeptidase. Analysis of the hydrolysates of the two peaks by reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 4,A and B) showed in both cases a product eluting at 21 min with a strong fluorescence at 410 nm (excitation, 280 nm). The identity of this fluorescent compound was confirmed by demonstrating co-migration with authentic dityrosine on reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 4 C). The fluorescence excitation and emission maxima of the fluorescent compounds were virtually identical to those of authentic, purified dityrosine at acid, neutral, and alkaline pH (data not shown), providing strong additional evidence that LPO-Mb hetero-oligomerization was due to the formation of tyrosine-tyrosine cross-links between the two proteins. The possible occurrence of a radical transfer from Mb to LPO in the Mb/H2O2/LPO system was investigated by sequentially adding catalase and then LPO to the Mb/H2O2 reaction mixture. Catalase and LPO were added 10 and 20 s after H2O2, respectively, to allow time for the catalase to remove unreacted H2O2 and thus to ensure that cross-linking was not due to LPO radicals formed by direct reaction with H2O2. As can be seen (compare Fig.5 with Fig. 1), adding catalase before LPO had little effect on the type of cross-linked products that were formed. In particular, the dimeric and trimeric LPO-Mb forms were observable despite the addition of catalase to the HoMb incubation (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 6). Similar results were obtained with SwMb (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and 6), except that additional bands are present due to the simultaneous formation of SwMb homodimers. Control experiments performed in the absence of Mb showed that (a) when catalase was omitted, monomeric LPO was partially converted to dimeric and trimeric products (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 5) and (b) addition of catalase 10 s before the addition of LPO prevented oligomerization of the enzyme (Fig. 5,A and B, lane 4). Thus, under the conditions used, catalase is effective in removing unreacted H2O2 before the addition of LPO. Thus, the oligomerization of LPO observed in the presence of Mb in this experimental protocol is the result of a radical transfer from Mb to LPO. Essentially the same result was obtained using wild-type rLPO in place of native LPO (Fig. 6). rLPO displayed an enzymatic activity that was 50% lower than that of the native protein (data not shown) and, in unexpected contrast to the native form, exhibited little self-dimerization upon treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 6, lane 5). Nevertheless, ∼50% of the monomeric rLPO migrates in the location of LPO-Mb heterodimers and LPO homodimers when treated with H2O2 in the presence of HoMb (Fig. 6,lanes 1 and 6). An intense ESR spectrum characteristic of an immobilized nitroxide was detected when DBNBS was simultaneously added with LPO after preincubation of Mb/H2O2 with catalase to remove excess H2O2 (Fig.7 A). No signal could be detected in the absence of either SwMb (Fig. 7 B) or H2O2 (Fig. 7 C), indicating that formation of the EPR signal requires the presence of this protein and is not due to radicals formed by the direct reaction of LPO with H2O2. A much weaker signal was observed with the SwMb/H2O2/DBNBS system in the absence of LPO (Fig. 7 D). This signal, which is reproducibly less than 30% of the intensity of the signal from the complete system, is believed to originate from direct reaction of H2O2-activated SwMb with DBNBS. Identical behavior and signals were observed when HoMb was used in place of SwMb (data not shown). To identify the residues involved in cross-linking and in radical transfer reactions, site-directed mutant Mb proteins in which the tyrosine or tryptophan residues were replaced by phenylalanines were used. The results of cross-linking experiments carried out with mixtures of native LPO and recombinant Mb proteins are shown in Fig.8 A. The double integrated areas of the ESR spectra obtained when DBNBS was added simultaneously with the LPO to the reaction mixture are shown in Fig. 8 B. The areas of the corresponding background signals obtained in the absence of LPO are also shown. As before, catalase and LPO were added 10 and 20 s, respectively, after H2O2 to remove unreacted H2O2 and to ensure that the cross-links and/or ESR signals were not due to radicals formed by direct reaction of LPO with H2O2. Replacement of Tyr-103 or Tyr-151 significantly inhibited cross-linking of the SwMb with LPO, and the triple tyrosine mutant gave no detectable cross-linking (Fig. 8 A). This implicates these two tyrosine residues in the hetero-oligomerization process. In contrast, removal of Tyr-146, Trp-7, or Trp-14 had little or no effect. Spin trapping experiments showed the presence of radical species capable of reaction with DBNBS in the incubations of native LPO with all the recombinant Mb proteins that were investigated (Fig. 8 B). Maximal ESR signal intensities were obtained with the single Y103F and Y151F mutants as well as with the triple tyrosine mutant (Fig.8 B). These intensities are approximately double the intensities seen with the other Mb mutants or with the wild-type enzyme. This may result from an increased efficiency of radical transfer from Mb to LPO caused by blocking the tyrosine radical to dityrosine decay pathway. The formation of SwMb homodimers and the analogous formation of LPO homodimers on reaction of these hemoproteins with H2O2 were established by earlier studies (27Lardinois O.M. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35441-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,38Rice R.H. Lee Y.M. Brown W.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the formation of hetero-oligomeric species involving the cross-linking of LPO to one, two, or possibly more Mb molecules (Fig.1) is a new observation. As found earlier for the Mb and LPO homodimers, fluorescence spectroscopy indicates that the hetero-oligomeric LPO-Mb species, like the Mb and LPO homodimers, are held together by dityrosine cross-links (Fig. 3). Interestingly, LPO-Mb oligomers are formed with both SwMb and HoMb, even though HoMb does not self-dimerize because it lacks the Tyr-151 residue that is absolutely required for homodimer formation (Fig. 1). Earlier studies established that Tyr-151 was necessary for SwMb homodimerization, although the principal dityrosine cross-link was formed between Tyr-151 of one molecule and Tyr-103 of the other molecule (10Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyr-146, which is buried in the protein, is not involved in dimerization reactions, but Tyr-151 can cross-link to itself. The dityrosine link between SwMb and LPO could therefore involve Tyr-151 or Tyr-103 of Mb. Because HoMb lacks Tyr-151, its dityrosine cross-link to LPO must be through Tyr-103. This inference is strongly supported by the finding that (a) mutation of either Tyr-103 or Tyr-151 to a phenylalanine in SwMb greatly decreases oligomerization and (b) mutation of both Tyr-103 and Tyr-151 suppresses oligomerization, whereas mutation of Tyr-146, Trp-7, or Trp-14 has no effect on the reaction (Fig. 8). The LPO tyrosine residue linked to the tyrosine in Mb is more difficult to define. One possibility is that the link involves Tyr-289, which is the residue that is also involved in LPO self-dimerization (27Lardinois O.M. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35441-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The fact that LPO dimer formation is attenuated in the presence of SwMb or HoMb supports this interpretation, but the evidence is inconclusive because trapping of a LPO radical at another site if the LPO radical is able to exchange among several sites on the protein would still diminish the formation of LPO dimers. Furthermore, the formation of LPO(HoMb)2 trimers involving dityrosine bonds virtually requires that at least two tyrosines in LPO must be able to cross-link to Mb to generate the HoMb-LPO-HoMb structure. In the case of SwMb, formation of the LPO(HoMb)2 trimer does not absolutely require the involvement of two LPO tyrosine residues because SwMb has two tyrosines that can undergo cross-linking reactions. It is therefore theoretically possible that the trimer has the structure LPO-SwMb-SwMb, so that there is only one bond to the LPO unit. However, the formation of a LPO(HoMb)2 trimer indicates that at least two tyrosines in LPO are available for cross-linking to HoMb. Dityrosine cross-links are formed by the coupling of two tyrosine radicals in a radical recombination process, hence radicals must be present on both tyrosine residues for efficient coupling. To determine whether a protein radical present on a Mb molecule can be transferred to a tyrosine residue in LPO, Mb was exposed to a limited excess of H2O2, and catalase was then added to quench the remaining H2O2 before LPO was added to scavenge the excess peroxide. Under conditions in which the excess H2O2 is removed efficiently, cross-linking of LPO is still observed. This finding requires transfer of the Mb radical to LPO, followed by condensation with an Mb radical (Fig. 5). The radical transfer could involve specific residues, for example, transfer of the radical from Tyr-151 to the recipient site on LPO, or could result from a more general and undefined process that does not require the interaction of specific Mb residues with receptor residues in LPO. The finding that mutation of Tyr-103 and/or Tyr-151, but not Tyr-146, Trp-7, or Trp-14, inhibits or suppresses oligomerization clearly establishes that the electron transfer is not mandatorily mediated by Tyr-146, Trp-7, or Trp-14, although it is not possible to determine whether it is mediated by Tyr-103 or Tyr-151 because these two residues are required to form the dityrosine link. However, the finding that the trapping of LPO radicals by DBNBS is unimpaired when the triple tyrosine mutant of SwMb is used as the radical donor (Fig. 8) and is observed even in the absence of oligomerization indicates that radical transfer occurs in the absence of any of the residues that have been demonstrated to act as radical sites in Mb. Thus, although dimerization requires the participation of specific tyrosines in Mb, the radical transfer to LPO does not. One very interesting finding is that rLPO is much less susceptible to self-dimerization than the native protein in the absence of Mb, but the two proteins form equal amounts of homodimers in the presence of Mb. Previous work with the heterologously expressed protein has shown that the primary difference between rLPO and LPO is that the heme group is covalently bound to the protein in the native enzyme, but only partially so in the recombinant protein (28Depillis G.D. Ozaki S.-I. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8857-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This difference, which is consistent with the finding that the heme-protein cross-linking reaction is autocatalytic (28Depillis G.D. Ozaki S.-I. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8857-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), readily explains our finding that the initial activity of the recombinant protein is half that of the native enzyme. However, the lack of self-dimerization in the absence of Mb is puzzling because the spectroscopic evidence suggests that the secondary and tertiary structures of the recombinant protein are unperturbed. The finding that self-dimerization does not occur in the absence of Mb but occurs normally in its presence suggests that the radical obtained by transfer from Mb to rLPO may be located at a different site from that at which it is located when generated by direct reaction of rLPO with H2O2. The present results establish that (a) the HoMb and SwMb protein radicals can be transferred to LPO, (b) none of the residues known to bear unpaired electron density in SwMb is specifically required for the radical transfer, and (c) the radical transferred to rLPO can support dimerization with Mb, even though the radicals generated by direct reaction of rLPO with H2O2 only very poorly yield the usual rLPO homodimer. This demonstration that radical transfer occurs between Mb and LPO complements recent reports that incubation of Mb with H2O2 in the presence of serum albumin produces EPR-detectable serum albumin-derived radicals through a radical transfer mechanism (39Østdal H. Skibsted L.H. Andersen H.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Irwin J.A. Østdal H. Davies M.J. Arch. Biochem.

However, it was concluded from the serum albumin experiments that a peroxy radical centered on Trp-14 was responsible for electron abstraction from, and therefore radical transfer to, serum albumin (40Irwin J.A. Østdal H. Davies M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our finding that both the W7F and W14F SwMb mutant are fully able to transfer a radical to LPO clearly shows that neither tryptophan is essential for this reaction. It is possible that the Trp-14-peroxy radical participates in the reaction when present, but it is not essential for the radical transfer. The radical transfer thus appears to occur directly from the amino acid radicals in Mb. This finding is more closely mimicked by the finding that free tyrosine facilitates the oxidation of serum albumin by horseradish peroxidase (41Østdal H. Andersen H.J. Davies M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a reaction that presumably occurs by direct radical transfer from the free tyrosine radical to the protein."

Thompson R.C.A. Reynoldson J.A. Lymbery A.J. Giardia: From Molecules to Disease. University Press, Cambridge1994: 15-37Google Scholar). Giardia is one of the most common causes of water-borne disease in humans; symptoms include diarrhea, growth retardation, and malnutrition. There are an estimated 280 million cases of giardiasis and some 10,000 mortalities from the disease, annually (2Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55 (.,732): 706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Warren K.S. McAdam P.W.J. New Strategies in Parasitology. Churchill Livingston, Edinburgh1989: 217-231Google Scholar).Measurements of the pH of the gastrointestinal tract show that in the duodenum the pH ranges from 6.4 to 7.0, whereas in the proximal small intestine the pH ranges from 6.3 to 6.6 (4Fallingborg J.

Thus, in vivo, G. intestinalis trophozoites must withstand a relatively acidic extracellular environment. G. intestinalisis an amitochondriate protist that relies on amino acid and carbohydrate fermentation for its energy (6Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Edwards M.R. Upcroft P. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Products of its microaerobic metabolism include organic acids such as acetate and these constitute a substantial intracellular acid load.Maintenance of the cytosolic pH (pHi)1 within a physiological range is critical for survival of any organism, because virtually all biological processes are affected by pH. Eukaryote cells use a range of membrane transport mechanisms to import/export H+ and HCO 3− from the cytosol. These include the electroneutral Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) and the HCO 3−-dependent exchangers that mediate HCO 3−/Cl−exchange or Na+HCO 3−/Cl−exchange. H+ efflux can also be mediated by ATP-dependent proton pumps. These include P-type H+-ATPases (as found in yeast, e.g. Ref. 7Serrano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), P-type H+,K+-ATPases (as found in the apical membrane of the gastric mucosa, e.g. Ref. 8DuBose Jr., T.D. Gitomer J. Codina J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1999; 8: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and V-type H+-ATPases (found in the intracellular vacuolar membranes of cells of higher eukaryotes (e.g. Ref. 9Forgac M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as in the plasma membrane of some cell types, including a number of parasitic protozoa (10Benchimol M.

Chem. 1999; 247: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar)).There are a number of techniques available for the estimation of pHi. These include NMR spectroscopy, measurement of the distribution of weak acids, and the use of intracellular pH-sensitive fluorophores.The most widely used form of the NMR method takes advantage of the pH dependence of the chemical shift (i.e. spectral position) of the peak arising from intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) in a 31P NMR spectrum of intact cells (13Padan E. Zilberstein D. Schuldiner S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 650: 151-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The low inherent sensitivity of the 31P NMR method necessitates the use of high cell densities (which can lead to the metabolic viability of the cells being compromised) as well as limiting the time resolution of the technique.Calculation of pHi from the distribution of radiolabeled weak acids such as 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione (DMO) assumes that the uncharged form of the molecule equilibrates across the membrane, whereas the ionized species is membrane impermeable. The relative concentrations of the charged and uncharged species is pH-dependent and hence if the intra- and extracellular DMO concentrations ([DMO]i and [DMO]o, respectively) and the extracellular pH (pHo) are known, the pHi can be determined (14Glaser T.A. Baatz J.E. Kreishman G.P. Mukkada A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7602-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This method is more straightforward than the 31P NMR method and requires lower cell numbers. However the calculation of pHi from the measured DMO distribution relies on the assumption that the marker is neither actively transported nor bound nor accumulated in compartments within the cell.In recent years pH-sensitive fluorophores, such as the ratiometric pH indicator 2′,7′-bis (carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) have come to represent the method of choice for the determination of pHi. This technique permits on-line measurements of pHi, allowing the effect of additions of ions and inhibitors to be determined in real time (15Thomas J.A. Kolbeck P.C. Langworthy T.A. Nuccitelli R. Deamer D.W. Intracellular pH: Its Measurement, Regulation and Utilization in Cellular Fractions. A. R. Liss Inc., New York1982Google Scholar).The aim of the present study was to use a combination of the techniques outlined above to estimate the resting pHi of G. intestinalis trophozoites (over a range of extracellular pHs), and to investigate the mechanism(s) involved in extruding H+from the cell, thereby protecting it from intracellular acidosis.DISCUSSIONCentral to the parasite pathogenicity is its ability to survive the dynamic environment of its host. In the case of G. intestinalis trophozoites, they must withstand exposure to a wide range of pH ranges as found in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study G. intestinalis trophozoites exposed to pHo values in the range 6.0–7.5 (similar to those experienced in vivo) were shown by three different techniques to maintain a resting pHi of 6.7–7.1. Similar values for pHi have been reported for other parasitic protozoa; e.g. Trypanosoma brucei epimastigotes (pHi 7.0–7.2, Ref. 22Ter Kuile B.H. Wiemer E.A.C. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Mol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16254-16259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and P. falciparum trophozoites (pHi 7.3, Refs. 12Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).In suspensions of G. intestinalis trophozoites incubated for up to an hour, the pHo decreased significantly and to a greater extent than the pHi. The decrease in pHo was larger for cells to which either glucose (ΔpHo = 0.79) or no substrate (ΔpHo = 0.78) were added than for cells to which arginine was added (ΔpHo = 0.52). In the absence of exogenous substrate, it is likely that the trophozoites were reliant on endogenous glucose stores (e.g. glycogen, Ref. 25Lanfredi-Rangel A. Diniz J.A. de Souza W. Parasitol. Res. 1999; 85: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and that the metabolism was therefore essentially the same as that occurring in cells supplemented with glucose. Glucose metabolism in G. intestinalis results in the production of the acidic end-product acetic acid (26Edwards M.R. Gilroy F.V. Jimenez B.M. O'Sullivan W.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 37: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Kranz P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas arginine catabolism generates ammonia and ornithine, alkaline and neutral products, respectively (6Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Edwards M.R. Upcroft P. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The pronounced extracellular acidification observed in suspensions in which the cells were utilizing glucose is likely to be due primarily to the production of acetic acid whereas the lesser acidification observed in cells supplemented with arginine probably represents the combined effects of arginine and glucose (glycogen) metabolism.The buffering capacity of G. intestinalis was estimated to be 32 mm pH−1 (at pH 6.2–6.3). This value is in the range reported for other cell types (21Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar) and very close to the value estimated for the protozoan P. falciparum (35 mm pH−1, (24Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)).Maintenance of a steady-state pHi in G. intestinalis was shown to be Na+-dependent with pHi declining sharply in cells suspended in Na+-free medium (Fig. 3 A). The recovery of pHi in cells subjected to an intracellular acid load was also Na+-dependent (Fig. 3 B). Maintenance of the resting pHi and recovery from an acid load were both inhibited by the carboxyl-blocking agent DCCD and unaffected by the two amiloride analogs, EIPA and HMA. However, amiloride itself was found to inhibit the recovery of pHifrom an imposed intracellular acidification whereas having no significant effect on the ability of the parasite to maintain its normal resting pHi. Amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchangers in a wide range of cell types is not highly selective and is known to affect a range of biological processes. Nevertheless, the finding that the recovery of pHi from an intracellular acidification, observed in the nominal absence of HCO 3− from the medium, is both Na+-dependent and amiloride-sensitive is at least consistent with the pathway involved being a type of Na+/H+ exchanger. The flux of H+ via this pathway was a saturable function of the extracellular Na+ concentration, with an apparentKm for Na+ of 18 mm. This value is comparable with that reported for Na+/H+ exchanger-mediated H+extrusion from vertebrate cells: e.g. thymic lymphocytes (59 mm, 28Grinstein S. Cohen S. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 83: 341-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), apical membrane cells of amphibian gall bladder (11 mm, Ref. 29Weinman S.A. Reuss L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and dog kidney cells (42 mm, Ref. 30Rindler M.J. Saier M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10820-10824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The finding that the resting, steady-state pHi is unaffected by amiloride would suggest that the maintenance of a normal resting pHi is achieved via a H+ extrusion mechanism that differs from that which plays the major role in the efflux of H+ following an intracellular acidification. Although amiloride-insensitive, this pathway is Na+-dependent and DCCD-sensitive. The available data are consistent with it being an amiloride-insensitive Na+/H+ exchanger. Higher eukaryotes are known to have number of Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms (the NHE family; Ref. 31Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and it is not uncommon for vertebrate tissues to express more than one Na+/H+ isoform, having different Na+ affinities, pH dependences and amiloride sensitivities (e.g. NHE1 is known to be sensitive to amiloride whereas NHE3 is resistant to amiloride and amiloride analogues, Ref. 31Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Lower eukaryotes, such as S. cerevisiae, also contain more than one putative Na+/H+ exchanger (e.g. Ref. 32Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and although the pharmacology of these different transporters has not been fully elucidated, differences between isoforms might be expected. The possibility of there being more than one Na+/H+exchanger serving somewhat different functions in G. intestinalis is therefore not unprecedented.In some protozoa, the major H+ efflux mechanisms are thought to be electrogenic H+ pumps (e.g. Refs.10Benchimol M.

However, the pronounced Na+-dependence of H+ extrusion from G. intestinalis trophozoites, together with the lack of significant inhibitory effect of the H+ pump inhibitors NEM (a general H+ pump inhibitor), bafilomycin A1 (a specific V-type H+ pump inhibitor), or vanadate (a specific P-type H+ pump inhibitor) on either the resting pHi or the extrusion of H+ following an intracellular acidification would suggest that such pumps do not play a significant role in pHi regulation in G. intestinalistrophozoites.DCCD is perhaps best characterized as an inhibitor of electrogenic H+ pumps and an effect of DCCD on pHi is often taken as being indicative of the involvement of this class of proteins in the pH regulation. However, DCCD is a general carboxyl blocking agent, which has been shown to inhibit Na+/H+exchangers of higher organisms (e.g. Refs. 33Kinsella J.L. Wehrle J. Wilkins N. Sacktor B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7092-7097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Igarashi P. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 860-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of DCCD on both the maintenance of the normal resting pHi and the recovery from an intracellular acid load is therefore consistent with the postulated involvement of Na+/H+ exchangers in both processes.There are, to our knowledge, two previous reports of the presence of a Na+/H+ exchanger in parasitic protozoa. It has been proposed that in P. falciparum trophozoites a Na+/H+ exchanger serves as the major pathway for the extrusion of H+. The apparentKm for Na+ in this system was estimated to be ∼6 mm; however, this analysis was complicated by the presence of both a saturable and a linear transport component (24Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and, in any case, the role of a Na+/H+ exchanger in pHi regulation in this organism has recently been questioned (12Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 247: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Leishmania promastigotes have also been proposed to possess an Na+/H+ exchanger involved in pH control (35Jiang S. Anderson S. Winget D. Mukkada A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, this too has been disputed (36Zilberstein D Shapira M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).In summary, the results of the present study demonstrate the presence in G. intestinalis trophozoites of active H+extrusion mechanisms that act to maintain the pHi within an appropriate range. Available evidence indicates the presence of at least two Na+-dependent H+extrusion mechanisms. One is insensitive to amiloride and serves a housekeeping role in maintaining the normal resting pHi (in the face of a constant metabolic acid-load). The other is amiloride-sensitive and is activated in response to a cytosolic acidification. The two pathways are postulated to be members of the Na+/H+ exchanger family.Na+/H+ exchangers are ubiquitous from higher eukaryotes to bacteria (31Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotic cells the stoichometry of the Na+/H+ exchange is 1:1 (37Orlowski J. Shull G. Fliegel L. The Na+/H+ Exchanger. Chapman and Hall, New York1996: 1-20Google Scholar) whereas in lower eukaryotes and bacteria Na+/H+antiporters operate with a Na+/H+ ratio of 1:2 (38Taglicht D. Padan E. Shuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5382-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical characteristics of Giardia are often regarded as being a hybrid of those of eukaryotes and prokaryotes (6Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Edwards M.R. Upcroft P. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), with the antiquity of this organism being the focus of much interest (39Embley T.M. Hirt R.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the Na+-dependent H+ extrusion mechanisms shown in the present study to operate in Giardiatrophozoites, and the identification of the proteins involved may therefore be of significant interest in terms of the evolution of Na+/H+ exchangers. Giardia intestinalis is a parasitic protozoan that colonizes the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals (1Farthing M.J.G. Thompson R.C.A. Reynoldson J.A. Lymbery A.J. Giardia: From Molecules to Disease. University Press, Cambridge1994: 15-37Google Scholar). Giardia is one of the most common causes of water-borne disease in humans; symptoms include diarrhea, growth retardation, and malnutrition. There are an estimated 280 million cases of giardiasis and some 10,000 mortalities from the disease, annually (2Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55 (.,732): 706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Warren K.S. McAdam P.W.J. New Strategies in Parasitology. Churchill Livingston, Edinburgh1989: 217-231Google Scholar). Measurements of the pH of the gastrointestinal tract show that in the duodenum the pH ranges from 6.4 to 7.0, whereas in the proximal small intestine the pH ranges from 6.3 to 6.6 (4Fallingborg J. Christensen L.A. Ingeman-Nielsen M. Jacobsen B.A. Abildgaard K. Rasmussen H.H. Rasmussen S.N. Aliment. Pharmacol. Therap. 1990; 4: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 5Fallingborg J.

Thus, in vivo, G. intestinalis trophozoites must withstand a relatively acidic extracellular environment. G. intestinalisis an amitochondriate protist that relies on amino acid and carbohydrate fermentation for its energy (6Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Edwards M.R. Upcroft P. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Products of its microaerobic metabolism include organic acids such as acetate and these constitute a substantial intracellular acid load. Maintenance of the cytosolic pH (pHi)1 within a physiological range is critical for survival of any organism, because virtually all biological processes are affected by pH. Eukaryote cells use a range of membrane transport mechanisms to import/export H+ and HCO 3− from the cytosol. These include the electroneutral Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) and the HCO 3−-dependent exchangers that mediate HCO 3−/Cl−exchange or Na+HCO 3−/Cl−exchange. H+ efflux can also be mediated by ATP-dependent proton pumps. These include P-type H+-ATPases (as found in yeast, e.g. Ref. 7Serrano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), P-type H+,K+-ATPases (as found in the apical membrane of the gastric mucosa, e.g. Ref. 8DuBose Jr., T.D. Gitomer J. Codina J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1999; 8: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and V-type H+-ATPases (found in the intracellular vacuolar membranes of cells of higher eukaryotes (e.g. Ref. 9Forgac M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as in the plasma membrane of some cell types, including a number of parasitic protozoa (10Benchimol M. De Souza W. Vanderheyden N. Zhong L. Lu H.G. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Moreno S.N. Zhong L. Lu H.G. Souza W.D. Benchimol M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 247: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar)). There are a number of techniques available for the estimation of pHi. These include NMR spectroscopy, measurement of the distribution of weak acids, and the use of intracellular pH-sensitive fluorophores. The most widely used form of the NMR method takes advantage of the pH dependence of the chemical shift (i.e. spectral position) of the peak arising from intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) in a 31P NMR spectrum of intact cells (13Padan E. Zilberstein D. Schuldiner S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 650: 151-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The low inherent sensitivity of the 31P NMR method necessitates the use of high cell densities (which can lead to the metabolic viability of the cells being compromised) as well as limiting the time resolution of the technique. Calculation of pHi from the distribution of radiolabeled weak acids such as 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione (DMO) assumes that the uncharged form of the molecule equilibrates across the membrane, whereas the ionized species is membrane impermeable. The relative concentrations of the charged and uncharged species is pH-dependent and hence if the intra- and extracellular DMO concentrations ([DMO]i and [DMO]o, respectively) and the extracellular pH (pHo) are known, the pHi can be determined (14Glaser T.A. Baatz J.E. Kreishman G.P. Mukkada A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7602-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This method is more straightforward than the 31P NMR method and requires lower cell numbers. However the calculation of pHi from the measured DMO distribution relies on the assumption that the marker is neither actively transported nor bound nor accumulated in compartments within the cell. In recent years pH-sensitive fluorophores, such as the ratiometric pH indicator 2′,7′-bis (carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) have come to represent the method of choice for the determination of pHi. This technique permits on-line measurements of pHi, allowing the effect of additions of ions and inhibitors to be determined in real time (15Thomas J.A. Kolbeck P.C. Langworthy T.A. Nuccitelli R. Deamer D.W. Intracellular pH: Its Measurement, Regulation and Utilization in Cellular Fractions. A. R. Liss Inc., New York1982Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to use a combination of the techniques outlined above to estimate the resting pHi of G. intestinalis trophozoites (over a range of extracellular pHs), and to investigate the mechanism(s) involved in extruding H+from the cell, thereby protecting it from intracellular acidosis. DISCUSSIONCentral to the parasite pathogenicity is its ability to survive the dynamic environment of its host. In the case of G. intestinalis trophozoites, they must withstand exposure to a wide range of pH ranges as found in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study G. intestinalis trophozoites exposed to pHo values in the range 6.0–7.5 (similar to those experienced in vivo) were shown by three different techniques to maintain a resting pHi of 6.7–7.1. Similar values for pHi have been reported for other parasitic protozoa; e.g. Trypanosoma brucei epimastigotes (pHi 7.0–7.2, Ref. 22Ter Kuile B.H. Wiemer E.A.C. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 55: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Trypanosoma cruziepimastigotes (pHi 7.2, Ref. 23Vanderheyden N. Benaim G. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), Leishmania major promastigotes (pHi 6.75, Ref. 19Vieira L.L. Lavan A. Dagger F. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16254-16259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and P. falciparum trophozoites (pHi 7.3, Refs. 12Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 247: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).In suspensions of G. intestinalis trophozoites incubated for up to an hour, the pHo decreased significantly and to a greater extent than the pHi. The decrease in pHo was larger for cells to which either glucose (ΔpHo = 0.79) or no substrate (ΔpHo = 0.78) were added than for cells to which arginine was added (ΔpHo = 0.52). In the absence of exogenous substrate, it is likely that the trophozoites were reliant on endogenous glucose stores (e.g. glycogen, Ref. 25Lanfredi-Rangel A. Diniz J.A. de Souza W. Parasitol. Res. 1999; 85: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and that the metabolism was therefore essentially the same as that occurring in cells supplemented with glucose. Glucose metabolism in G. intestinalis results in the production of the acidic end-product acetic acid (26Edwards M.R. Gilroy F.V. Jimenez B.M. O'Sullivan W.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 37: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Kranz P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas arginine catabolism generates ammonia and ornithine, alkaline and neutral products, respectively (6Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Edwards M.R. Upcroft P. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The pronounced extracellular acidification observed in suspensions in which the cells were utilizing glucose is likely to be due primarily to the production of acetic acid whereas the lesser acidification observed in cells supplemented with arginine probably represents the combined effects of arginine and glucose (glycogen) metabolism.The buffering capacity of G. intestinalis was estimated to be 32 mm pH−1 (at pH 6.2–6.3). This value is in the range reported for other cell types (21Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar) and very close to the value estimated for the protozoan P. falciparum (35 mm pH−1, (24Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)).Maintenance of a steady-state pHi in G. intestinalis was shown to be Na+-dependent with pHi declining sharply in cells suspended in Na+-free medium (Fig. 3 A). The recovery of pHi in cells subjected to an intracellular acid load was also Na+-dependent (Fig. 3 B). Maintenance of the resting pHi and recovery from an acid load were both inhibited by the carboxyl-blocking agent DCCD and unaffected by the two amiloride analogs, EIPA and HMA. However, amiloride itself was found to inhibit the recovery of pHifrom an imposed intracellular acidification whereas having no significant effect on the ability of the parasite to maintain its normal resting pHi. Amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchangers in a wide range of cell types is not highly selective and is known to affect a range of biological processes. Nevertheless, the finding that the recovery of pHi from an intracellular acidification, observed in the nominal absence of HCO 3− from the medium, is both Na+-dependent and amiloride-sensitive is at least consistent with the pathway involved being a type of Na+/H+ exchanger. The flux of H+ via this pathway was a saturable function of the extracellular Na+ concentration, with an apparentKm for Na+ of 18 mm. This value is comparable with that reported for Na+/H+ exchanger-mediated H+extrusion from vertebrate cells: e.g. thymic lymphocytes (59 mm, 28Grinstein S. Cohen S. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 83: 341-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), apical membrane cells of amphibian gall bladder (11 mm, Ref. 29Weinman S.A. Reuss L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and dog kidney cells (42 mm, Ref. 30Rindler M.J. Saier M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10820-10824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The finding that the resting, steady-state pHi is unaffected by amiloride would suggest that the maintenance of a normal resting pHi is achieved via a H+ extrusion mechanism that differs from that which plays the major role in the efflux of H+ following an intracellular acidification. Although amiloride-insensitive, this pathway is Na+-dependent and DCCD-sensitive. The available data are consistent with it being an amiloride-insensitive Na+/H+ exchanger. Higher eukaryotes are known to have number of Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms (the NHE family; Ref. 31Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and it is not uncommon for vertebrate tissues to express more than one Na+/H+ isoform, having different Na+ affinities, pH dependences and amiloride sensitivities (e.g. NHE1 is known to be sensitive to amiloride whereas NHE3 is resistant to amiloride and amiloride analogues, Ref. 31Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Lower eukaryotes, such as S. cerevisiae, also contain more than one putative Na+/H+ exchanger (e.g. Ref. 32Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and although the pharmacology of these different transporters has not been fully elucidated, differences between isoforms might be expected. The possibility of there being more than one Na+/H+exchanger serving somewhat different functions in G. intestinalis is therefore not unprecedented.In some protozoa, the major H+ efflux mechanisms are thought to be electrogenic H+ pumps (e.g. Refs.10Benchimol M. De Souza W. Vanderheyden N. Zhong L. Lu H.G. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Moreno S.N. Zhong L. Lu H.G. Souza W.D. Benchimol M.

Amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchangers in a wide range of cell types is not highly selective and is known to affect a range of biological processes. Nevertheless, the finding that the recovery of pHi from an intracellular acidification, observed in the nominal absence of HCO 3− from the medium, is both Na+-dependent and amiloride-sensitive is at least consistent with the pathway involved being a type of Na+/H+ exchanger. The flux of H+ via this pathway was a saturable function of the extracellular Na+ concentration, with an apparentKm for Na+ of 18 mm. This value is comparable with that reported for Na+/H+ exchanger-mediated H+extrusion from vertebrate cells: e.g. thymic lymphocytes (59 mm, 28Grinstein S. Cohen S. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 83: 341-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), apical membrane cells of amphibian gall bladder (11 mm, Ref. 29Weinman S.A. Reuss L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and dog kidney cells (42 mm, Ref. 30Rindler M.J. Saier M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10820-10824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that the resting, steady-state pHi is unaffected by amiloride would suggest that the maintenance of a normal resting pHi is achieved via a H+ extrusion mechanism that differs from that which plays the major role in the efflux of H+ following an intracellular acidification. Although amiloride-insensitive, this pathway is Na+-dependent and DCCD-sensitive. The available data are consistent with it being an amiloride-insensitive Na+/H+ exchanger. Higher eukaryotes are known to have number of Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms (the NHE family; Ref. 31Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and it is not uncommon for vertebrate tissues to express more than one Na+/H+ isoform, having different Na+ affinities, pH dependences and amiloride sensitivities (e.g. NHE1 is known to be sensitive to amiloride whereas NHE3 is resistant to amiloride and amiloride analogues, Ref. 31Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Lower eukaryotes, such as S. cerevisiae, also contain more than one putative Na+/H+ exchanger (e.g. Ref. 32Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and although the pharmacology of these different transporters has not been fully elucidated, differences between isoforms might be expected. The possibility of there being more than one Na+/H+exchanger serving somewhat different functions in G. intestinalis is therefore not unprecedented. In some protozoa, the major H+ efflux mechanisms are thought to be electrogenic H+ pumps (e.g. Refs.10Benchimol M. De Souza W. Vanderheyden N. Zhong L. Lu H.G. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Moreno S.N. Zhong L. Lu H.G. Souza W.D. Benchimol M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 247: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the pronounced Na+-dependence of H+ extrusion from G. intestinalis trophozoites, together with the lack of significant inhibitory effect of the H+ pump inhibitors NEM (a general H+ pump inhibitor), bafilomycin A1 (a specific V-type H+ pump inhibitor), or vanadate (a specific P-type H+ pump inhibitor) on either the resting pHi or the extrusion of H+ following an intracellular acidification would suggest that such pumps do not play a significant role in pHi regulation in G. intestinalistrophozoites. DCCD is perhaps best characterized as an inhibitor of electrogenic H+ pumps and an effect of DCCD on pHi is often taken as being indicative of the involvement of this class of proteins in the pH regulation. However, DCCD is a general carboxyl blocking agent, which has been shown to inhibit Na+/H+exchangers of higher organisms (e.g. Refs. 33Kinsella J.L. Wehrle J. Wilkins N. Sacktor B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7092-7097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Igarashi P. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 860-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of DCCD on both the maintenance of the normal resting pHi and the recovery from an intracellular acid load is therefore consistent with the postulated involvement of Na+/H+ exchangers in both processes. There are, to our knowledge, two previous reports of the presence of a Na+/H+ exchanger in parasitic protozoa. It has been proposed that in P. falciparum trophozoites a Na+/H+ exchanger serves as the major pathway for the extrusion of H+. The apparentKm for Na+ in this system was estimated to be ∼6 mm; however, this analysis was complicated by the presence of both a saturable and a linear transport component (24Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and, in any case, the role of a Na+/H+ exchanger in pHi regulation in this organism has recently been questioned (12Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 247: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Leishmania promastigotes have also been proposed to possess an Na+/H+ exchanger involved in pH control (35Jiang S. Anderson S. Winget D. Mukkada A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, this too has been disputed (36Zilberstein D Shapira M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In summary, the results of the present study demonstrate the presence in G. intestinalis trophozoites of active H+extrusion mechanisms that act to maintain the pHi within an appropriate range. Available evidence indicates the presence of at least two Na+-dependent H+extrusion mechanisms. One is insensitive to amiloride and serves a housekeeping role in maintaining the normal resting pHi (in the face of a constant metabolic acid-load). The other is amiloride-sensitive and is activated in response to a cytosolic acidification. The two pathways are postulated to be members of the Na+/H+ exchanger family. Na+/H+ exchangers are ubiquitous from higher eukaryotes to bacteria (31Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotic cells the stoichometry of the Na+/H+ exchange is 1:1 (37Orlowski J. Shull G. Fliegel L. The Na+/H+ Exchanger. Chapman and Hall, New York1996: 1-20Google Scholar) whereas in lower eukaryotes and bacteria Na+/H+antiporters operate with a Na+/H+ ratio of 1:2 (38Taglicht D. Padan E. Shuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5382-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical characteristics of Giardia are often regarded as being a hybrid of those of eukaryotes and prokaryotes (6Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Edwards M.R. Upcroft P. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), with the antiquity of this organism being the focus of much interest (39Embley T.M. Hirt R.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the Na+-dependent H+ extrusion mechanisms shown in the present study to operate in Giardiatrophozoites, and the identification of the proteins involved may therefore be of significant interest in terms of the evolution of Na+/H+ exchangers.
