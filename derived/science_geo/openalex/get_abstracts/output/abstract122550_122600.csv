https://openalex.org/W1989294105,"Akt is a serine/threonine kinase that requires a functional phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to be stimulated by insulin and other growth factors. When directed to membranes by the addition of a src myristoylation sequence, Akt becomes constitutively active. In the present studies, the constitutively active Akt and a nonmyristoylated control mutant were expressed in 3T3-L1 cells that can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes. The constitutively active Akt induced glucose uptake into adipocytes in the absence of insulin by stimulating translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 to the plasma membrane. The constitutively active Akt also increased the synthesis of the ubiquitously expressed glucose transporter 1. The increased glucose influx in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes directed lipid but not glycogen synthesis. These results indicate that Akt can regulate glucose uptake and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2101790806,"We have identified a novel zinc-finger protein whose mRNA is expressed at high levels in the epidermal layer of the skin and in epithelial cells in the tongue, palate, esophagus, stomach, and colon of newborn mice. Expression in epithelial cells is first detected at the time of their differentiation during embryonic development. In addition, during early embryonic development there is expression in mesenchymal cells of the skeletal primordia and the metanephric kidney which is later down-regulated. The expression pattern suggests that the protein could be involved in terminal differentiation of several epithelial cell types and could also be involved in early differentiation of the skeleton and kidney. The carboxyl terminus of the protein contains three zinc fingers with a high degree of homology to erythroid krüppel-like factor and binds to DNA fragments containing CACCC motifs. The amino-terminal portion of the protein is proline and serine-rich and can function as a transcriptional activator. The chromosomal location of the gene was mapped using mouse interspecific backcrosses and was shown to localize to mouse chromosome 4 and to cosegregate with the thioredoxin gene.

During embryogenesis, a single-cell zygote gives rise to a complex organism composed of many cell types which differentiate from their precursors in an intricate process involving the coordinate action of various cytokines, hormones, and growth factors which activate the expression of specific transcription factors in the cell. Many cell-specific transcription factors involved in the differentiation of tissues have been identified: these fall into several broad classes that include helix-loop-helix proteins, homeodomain proteins, and zinc-finger proteins. Zinc-finger transcription factors generally contain a cluster of zinc-finger motifs which together bind to specific DNA sequences; they can be divided into several classes based on the sequence and position of the cysteine and histidine residues and other conserved amino acids. The TFIIIA subclass of zinc-finger proteins is characterized by an amino acid motif (Cys-X2-4-Cys-X12-His-X3-4-His) that coordinates zinc ions and is involved in DNA binding. Some zinc-finger proteins of the TFIIIA subclass are widely expressed, such as Sp1 and the basic transcription element binding factor, BTEB 1The abbreviations used are: BTEBbasic transcription element binding factorWT-1Wilm's tumor gene productEKLFerythroid krüppel-like factorEGRearly growth response geneEZFepithelial zinc fingerGSTglutathione S-transferaseTshaα chain of chorionic gonadotropinGabrrγ-amino butyric acid receptorTxnthioredoxinkbkilobase pair(s).

However, other members of the class have a very restricted pattern of expression such as the Wilm's tumor gene product (WT-1) which is expressed in the urogenital system during early development or the erythroid krüppel-like factor (EKLF) which is highly expressed in erythroid cells (3Pritchard-Jones K.

Several experiments including gene targeting techniques have demonstrated that zinc-finger proteins are important for the proper differentiation of tissues in which they are expressed. EKLF is a zinc-finger protein highly expressed in erythroid cells which has been shown to bind to a CACCC box sequence found in the β-globin promoter (4Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Loss of functional EKLF in mice results in lethal anemia since since β-globin is not synthesized (5Nuez B. Michalovich D.

Krox-20 (or EGR-2) is a zinc-finger protein specifically expressed in rhombomeres 3 and 5 of the hindbrain during early embryonic development (7Wilkinson D.G. Bhatt S. Chavrier P. Bravo R. Charnay P. Nature. 1989; 337: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Loss of functional Krox-20 in mice results in malformation of these portions of the brain (8Swiatek P.J. Gridley T.

Indeed, there are also defects in myelination and endochondral ossification in Krox-20 knockout mice (10Topilko P. Schneider-Maunoury S. Levi G. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Chennoufi A.B. Seitanidou T.

Development. 1996; 122: 113-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WT-1 is a zinc-finger protein expressed during embryogenesis in the kidney and genital tissues (3Pritchard-Jones K. Fleming S. Davidson D. Bickmore W. Porteous D. Gosden C. Bard J. Buckler A. Pelletier J. Housman D. van Heyningen V. Hastie N. Nature. 1990; 346: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). In mice loss of functional WT-1 protein results in failure of the kidney and gonads to form (12Kreidberg J.A. Sariola H. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D. Jaenisch R.

Ito C.Y. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Haber D.A. Rose E.A. Kral A. Yeger H. Lewis W.H. Jones C. Housman D.E.

Cancer Inst. 1982; 68: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar). One major interest of our research is the differentiation of fibroblasts and osteoblasts from their mesenchymal precursors. As a marker for these lineages we have studied the expression of the mouse α2(I) collagen gene. Previous evidence from our laboratory indicated that high levels of expression of the mouse α2(I) collagen promoter in transfected cells was dependent on three G/C-rich regions in the proximal promoter which appeared to bind several members of the zinc-finger family of transcription factors (16Hasegawa T. Zhou X. Garrett L.A. Ruteshouser E.C. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to clone cDNAs for zinc-finger proteins which were expressed at high levels in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and which might play a role in activating the collagen promoter, we cloned a novel protein which we call epithelial zinc finger (EZF). The gene for this protein is expressed in certain mesenchymal cells that give rise to the skeleton and kidney. However, expression in these cell types is a transient phenomenon and is not found in newborn mice in which the collagen genes are actively expressed. Instead, expression of the EZF message switches almost exclusively to epithelial cell types (hence the name epithelial zinc finger) during the later stages of embryogenesis at the time of their differentiation. Expression in epithelial cells is also high in newborn mice. Our results suggest that the EZF protein is a transcriptional activator that may play a role in the differentiation of epithelial cells in many organs including the skin, tongue, esophagus, stomach, and colon. EZF may also function in the development of the skeleton and kidney during early steps in the formation of these organs. First-strand cDNA was prepared from poly(A)+ RNA of primary mouse fibroblasts derived from embryos at E13.5. This cDNA was then used as a template in a polymerase chain reaction (17Zhao G-Q. Zhou X. Eberspaecher H. Solursh M. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8633-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with an oligo(dT) primer and two degenerate primers (CACATCAGGA-CCCA(C/T)ACIGG(A/G)GA and CACATCCGIACCCA(T/C)ACIGG(T/C)GA) homologous to an amino acid sequence (HIRTHTGE) that is conserved among several members of the zinc-finger family. The PCR products were hybridized with a second degenerate oligonucleotide (ACCGGCGA(A/G)AA(A/G)CCITT(T/C)G(A/C)ITG) homologous to an overlapping region of the zinc-finger domain (TGEKPFAC). DNA from 50 random positive clones was sequenced and compared with the GenBank data base. Two of the clones contained partial cDNAs for a novel zinc-finger protein which we call EZF. A λZAP library was then constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of E15.5-day whole mouse embryos and screened with the insert from one of the EZF clones isolated above. Three positive clones of 2.5 to 2.8 kb encoding the complete open reading frame were isolated. Total RNA was isolated from various mouse tissues and cells as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was electrophoresed through formaldehyde gels, transferred to Zeta-Probe membranes (Bio-Rad), and hybridized with a probe containing a portion of the zinc-finger region and 3′-untranslated sequences. To generate a probe for in situ analysis, we cloned a 160-bp fragment of the EZF cDNA encoding a nonconserved portion of the proline-rich domain into pBluescript KS between the NotI and SacI sites to yield the plasmid pBS160. DNA was then either linearized with SacI and transcribed with T3 polymerase to yield a sense RNA probe, or linearized with XbaI and transcribed with T7 polymerase to yield an antisense RNA probe. Transcription reactions included [35S]UTP as label. In situ hybridizations were performed as described previously (17Zhao G-Q. Zhou X. Eberspaecher H. Solursh M. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8633-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Slides were exposed at 4°C for 12-14 days. A segment of the EZF cDNA coding for amino acids 321-474 was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the vector pGEX-4T3 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) to generate the plasmid pND2, which produces an in-frame fusion of glutathione S-transferase (GST) with the zinc fingers of EZF. For isolation of GST proteins, bacteria were grown to early log phase and induced for 30-90 min with 1 mM isopropylthiogalactose. The resuspended bacterial pellet was then sonicated in E buffer (12 mM Hepes, pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.25 mM ZnCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 1 mM and pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin at 10 μg/ml). The supernatant was then incubated with glutathione-agarose resin (Sigma) for 30 min and washed with E buffer. Finally, the protein was eluted with 5 mM glutathione in E buffer. For gel shift analysis, double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with Klenow enzyme and [32P]dCTP or with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Probe oligonucleotide (40,000-60,000 cpm) was incubated with 50-100 ng of recombinant GST-ND2 fusion protein in E-2 buffer (same as E buffer described above but without Triton X-100 and with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction products were run on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. For activation studies, various segments of the EZF cDNA were cloned between the Asp718 and BamHI sites of the Gal4 expression vector, pSG424 (19Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. HeLa cells were grown in 5% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 8% CO2. One microgram of Gal4 expression plasmid was transfected into cells along with 10 μg of a reporter plasmid containing five Gal4 DNA-binding sites (20Martin K.J. Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and 5 μg of SVβ-Gal as an internal control. The cells were electroporated with a Gene Pulser electroporator (Bio-Rad) and harvested 48 h after transfection. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities were measured using a liquid scintillation assay as described previously (21Sankaran L. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities were measured using a resorufin-β-D-galactopyranoside substrate at 30°C. C3H/HeJ-gld and Mus spretus mice and [(C3H/HeJ-gld × Mus spretus)F1 × C3H/HeJ-gld] interspecific back-cross mice were bred and maintained as described previously (22Seldin M.F. Morse H.C. Reeves J.P. Scribner J.P. LeBoeuf R.C. Steinberg A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). M. spretus was chosen as the second parent in this cross because of the relative ease of detecting of informative restriction fragment length variants in comparison with crosses made using conventional laboratory strains. DNA was isolated from mouse organs, blotted to nylon membranes, and hybridized with a fragment of the EZF cDNA under stringent conditions as described previously (23Watson M.L. Seldin M.F. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 369-387Google Scholar). Gene linkage was determined by segregation analysis (24Green E.L. Green E. Genetics and Probability in Animal Breeding Experiments. Macmillan, New York1981: 77-113Crossref Google Scholar). Gene order was determined by analyzing all haplotypes and minimizing crossover frequency between all genes that were determined to be within a linkage group. This method resulted in determination of the most likely gene order (25Bishop D.T. Genet. Epidemiol. 1985; 2: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The mapping of reference loci in this interspecific cross (Tsha, Gabrr, Txn, and Jun) has been previously described (26Ceci J.D. Siracusa L.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genomics. 1990; 5: 699-709Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Cutting G.R. Curristin S. Zoghbi H. O'Hara B. Seldin M.F. Uhl G.R.

Genomics. 1994; 21: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We sought to identify novel zinc-finger proteins of the TFIIIA subclass which were expressed in embryonic fibroblasts. We used a polymerase chain reaction strategy with degenerate oligonucleotides (17Zhao G-Q. Zhou X. Eberspaecher H. Solursh M. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8633-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to isolate partial cDNA clones of zinc finger proteins using cDNA from primary fibroblasts of 13.5-day mouse embryos as a template. Two of the partial cDNA clones isolated in this fashion encoded a novel zinc-finger protein which we denoted EZF based on its expression pattern (see below). The cDNA clones isolated by polymerase chain reaction were subsequently used to screen for clones containing the entire open reading frame of the protein. Sequencing of the various cDNA clones showed the presence of three ATG codons near the 5′ end (Fig. 1A). The first of these ATG elements was followed by an open reading frame of 261 nucleotides capable of encoding an 87-amino acid peptide. However, the sequences surrounding this ATG codon are not in a favorable context for translation initiation as defined by Kozak (29Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). A second ATG codon in a different reading frame was located 599 base pairs from the 5′ end of the sequence shown in Fig. 1A. This ATG codon begins an open reading frame of 1449 nucleotides which would correspond to a 483-amino acid protein (Fig. 1A). However, this second ATG codon is also not in a very favorable context for translation initiation. It is, therefore, likely that the major translation product initiates at a third ATG codon located 27 nucleotides further downstream which better fits the consensus translation initiation site. Translation from this ATG codon would result in synthesis of a 474-amino acid protein (Fig. 1A.) with a predicted molecular mass of 52 kDa. Several stop codons in all three frames are located upstream of the major open reading frame indicating that the protein coding sequence does not extend further 5′. The predicted protein sequence (from either ATG-2 or ATG-3) contains three zinc fingers of the TFIIIA type at the extreme carboxyl terminus. As shown in Fig. 1B these zinc fingers have a high degree of homology with those present in lung krüppel-like factor, EKLF, and BTEB2. Since lung krüppel-like factor, EKLF, and BTEB2 are closely related in the DNA-binding domain, contain proline-rich amino-terminal regions, and are expressed in a tissue-restricted fashion, they have been proposed to fall into a separate subclass of zinc-finger proteins (30Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) that likely includes EZF as well. A lower but significant homology was also found with the zinc-finger regions of other proteins including BTEB, Sp1, WT-1, and the early growth response proteins EGR-1 and EGR-2. The first 384 amino acids of the protein contained a domain rich in proline (15%) and serine (13%) characteristic of certain transcriptional activation domains. Upstream of the zinc finger was a stretch of basic amino acids similar to a region in EGR-1 that has been shown to be important for nuclear localization (31Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Northern analysis with total RNA from tissues of newborn mice showed a major mRNA of 3.5 kb. In tissues with high levels of expression such as skin and lung we could also detect a minor mRNA of 1.9 kb (Fig. 2A). The relationship of the 1.9- and 3.5-kb RNAs is not presently clear but they may be alternatively spliced forms or be derived from alternate usage of polyadenylation signals. Newborn mouse skin had the highest levels of expression in our Northern analysis; lower levels were detected in lung and much lower levels in heart, kidney, brain, and liver. In addition, we also detected relatively abundant expression in primary fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos at E13.5 which was the source of the original EZF cDNA clones (data not shown). To analyze the developmental expression pattern of the Ezf gene we performed Northern analysis of RNA from mice at a series of embryonic stages. There was no expression in 9.5-day embryos, a low level of expression in 11.5- and 13.5-day embryos, and a high level of expression in 15.5-day embryos (Fig. 2B). To better localize the cells expressing the Ezf gene, we performed in situ hybridization with mouse embryos at various stages and also with tissues from newborn mice. As expected from the Northern analysis, no expression was detected in embryos at 9.5 days of development (data not shown). However, at 11.5 days of development we could detect expression in populations of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells in the nasal prominence and first branchial arch (Fig. 3A). Later during development mesenchymal cells that form the metanephric kidney (Fig. 3B) and the cartilaginous primordia of the skeleton (Fig. 3C, for example) showed a positive signal. In the skeletal primordia the EZF signal was confined to the peripheral layer of cells and was absent from more centrally located chondrocytic cells. In newborn mice we could detect little or no expression of the Ezf gene in mesenchymal cell types of various organs including bones and cartilages of the skeleton (data not shown). These observations suggest that expression of the Ezf gene in mesenchymal cell populations was transitory phenomenon of development. At E12.5 we detected expression of the EZF mRNA in epithelial cells in the dorsal surface of the tongue (data not shown). Expression in other epithelial cell types was very low until E15.5 when widespread expression in epithelial cells of the epidermis, vibrissae, oral mucosa, esophagus, and colon became apparent (see Fig. 4, A and B, for examples). In newborn mice, there was also widespread expression in various epithelial cells (Fig. 4C and Fig. 5). Our data indicate, however, that not all epithelial cell types express high levels of EZF since sections of the small intestine and bladder showed little or no signal (data not shown). High-power views of the epidermis indicated that the signal was much stronger in the differentiating suprabasal levels than it was in the mitotically active basal layer or in the underlying dermis (Fig. 5). Thus, expression of the EZF mRNA in epithelial cell types seemed to largely correlate with the onset of their differentiation.Fig. 5High-power view of the expression of EZF mRNA in epidermal cells as detected by in situ hybridization. Bar, 100 μm. The hybridization signal (black grains) is strong in the living suprabasal layers of cells of the epidermis but there is little or no signal in the non-living cornified outer envelope (arrowhead), the mitotically active basal layer (arrow) or the underlying dermis. There is also little signal associated with a hair follicle (brown pigment is melanin).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the ability of the EZF protein to bind to DNA, a recombinant fusion protein (GST-ND2) was generated containing GST fused in-frame to the zinc-finger region of EZF (amino acids 321-474). Using the GST-ND2 fusion protein, gel shift assays were performed with various oligonucleotides previously shown to bind to related zinc-finger proteins (Table I). The results show that the EZF fusion protein bound most efficiently to an oligonucleotide derived from the β-globin promoter containing a CACCC box sequence (Fig. 6A, lane 6). The EZF fusion protein could also bind well to an Sp1 site derived from the SV-40 promoter (lane 5) and to a BTE element from the rat cytochrome P4501A1 promoter (lane 4) which is a target for the BTEB proteins. Another Sp1 site (lane 3) derived from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat bound the recombinant EZF protein weakly but there was no binding to a high-affinity WT-1-binding site (lane 2) or to a consensus EGR-binding site (lane 1). These results suggest that the EZF protein binds to a subset of G/C-rich sequences.Table I.Oligonucleotide probes used in gel shift assaysOligonucleotideRef.Sequence (C-rich strand)aAll of the oligonucleotide probes except EGR contain GATC overhangs which allows labeling by Klenow enzyme.

The nucleotides indicated in bold type in the last three rows are mutations of the CACCC motif. Open table in a new tab To determine whether the CACCC motif of the EKLF-binding site was critical for EZF binding we tested three different point mutations in this site (Table I) which were previously shown to abolish binding of EKLF (36Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1493-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EZF fusion protein bound very poorly or not at all to these three mutants indicating that the bases in the CACCC motif were essential for high levels of binding (Fig. 6B). Moreover, none of the three mutant oligos was able to compete efficiently for binding to the wild-type CACCC-binding site (data not shown). We also wished to test the ability of the EZF protein to affect transcription of linked genes. Therefore, we fused various segments of the EZF protein in-frame with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 under the control of the SV40 promoter and enhancer and transfected them into HeLa cells along with a reporter gene containing five Gal4-binding sites. The potent acidic activation domain of VP16 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was transfected as a positive control. Fig. 7 shows that the proline/serine-rich region of EZF (EZF 1-360) provided a strong transcriptional activation function (about 40% of the level provided by Gal4-VP16). Neither the full-length protein (EZF 1-474) nor the zinc-finger region of EZF (EZF 363-474) could activate transcription from the same reporter when fused to Gal4. It may be that the full-length protein lacked activity because it had a higher affinity for endogenous target sites in HeLa chromatin than it did for the Gal4-binding sites in the reporter gene. Alternatively, the zinc-finger region of EZF might have masked its activation domain or contained additional domains that repressed the activity of the proline-rich region. To determine the chromosomal location of the Ezf gene, we analyzed a panel of DNA samples from an interspecific cross for which over 900 genetic markers throughout the mouse genome have been characterized. The genetic markers included in this map span 50 and 80 centimorgan on each mouse autosome and the X chromosome. Initially, DNA from the two parental mice, C3H/HeJ-gld and (C3H/HeJ-gld × Mus spretus)F1, were digested with various restriction endonucleases and hybridized with the EZF cDNA probe to identify restriction fragment length variants for use in haplotype analyses. Informative TaqI restriction fragment length variants were detected: C3H/HeJ-gld, 2.3 kb; Mus spretus, 2.4 kb. Comparison of the haplotype distribution of the Ezf restriction fragment length variants indicated that this gene cosegregated in all 114 meiotic events examined, with the thioredoxin (Txn) gene locus on mouse chromosome 4 (Fig. 8). The haplotype distribution of the genes localized to mouse chromosome 4 is shown in Fig. 8. The best gene order (25Bishop D.T. Genet. Epidemiol. 1985; 2: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) ± the standard deviation (24Green E.L. Green E. Genetics and Probability in Animal Breeding Experiments. Macmillan, New York1981: 77-113Crossref Google Scholar) indicated the following gene order: (centromere) Tsha/Gabrr − 6.1 ± 2.2 centimorgan − Ezf/Txn − 16.7 ± 3.5 centimorgan − Jun. Tsha is the α chain of chorionic gonadotropin, Gabrr symbolizes the linked genes for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunit rho1 and rho2, Txn is thioredoxin, and Jun is c-Jun. These reference loci have been previously mapped (26Ceci J.D. Siracusa L.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genomics. 1990; 5: 699-709Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Cutting G.R. Curristin S.

Genomics. 1994; 21: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study we have described EZF, a novel member of the TFIIIA class of zinc-finger proteins, that has three carboxyl-terminal zinc fingers with a high degree of homology to those of the tissue-specific transcription factors lung krüppel-like factor, EKLF, and BTEB2. The amino-terminal portion of this protein is rich in proline and serine residues which is typical of certain transcriptional activation domains. We showed that a recombinant bacterially synthesized protein containing the zinc-finger motif of the EZF protein fused to GST is capable of binding to several G/C-rich binding sites including a CACCC motif which is a target for the closely related transcription factor EKLF. Moreover, mutations in the CACCC motif which disrupt its interaction with EKLF also disrupt the binding of EZF indicating that the two proteins recognize very similar DNA sequences. The proline/serine-rich region of EZF fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain was able to function as a strong transcriptional activator having approximately 40% of the activity of the potent VP16 acidic activation domain. Together these data suggest that the EZF protein binds to a subset of G/C-rich sites similar to those recognized by EKLF and Sp1 and activates transcription through an amino-terminal proline/serine rich domain. Analysis of the expression pattern of the EZF mRNA showed that it was apparently first expressed at E11.5 in mesenchymal cells of the nasal prominence and first branchial arch. A little later expression was detected in mesenchymal cells surrounding the cartilaginous primordia of the skeleton as well as in the mesenchymal cells surrounding the metanephric kidney. Expression in these mesenchymal cell populations was detected at E13.5 and E15.5 as well but was almost undetectable in newborn mice. The mRNA for a related zinc-finger protein, WT-1, is also expressed during development of the kidney. However, WT-1 is expressed weakly in the mesenchymal blastema surrounding the kidney but is strongly expressed in differentiated kidney cells (3Pritchard-Jones K. Fleming S. Davidson D. Bickmore W. Porteous D. Gosden C. Bard J. Buckler A. Pelletier J. Housman D. van Heyningen V. Hastie N. Nature. 1990; 346: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) a pattern opposite to that which we detected for EZF. At E12.5 expression of the EZF mRNA was detected in epithelial cells of the dorsal surface of the tongue. Other epithelial cells began to express the EZF mRNA at 15.5 days of development. In newborn mice there was widespread high levels of expression in many epithelial cells such as those in the epidermis, vibrissae, tongue, palate, oral mucosa, esophagus, stomach, colon, and lung. There was, however, little or no expression in epithelial cells of the small intestine or bladder. Nor did we detect expression in any cells in the heart or kidney of newborn mice (data not shown). In the epidermis expression of the EZF mRNA seemed to be largely confined to differentiating cells and was not found in the basal cell layer which was mitotically active suggesting the possibility that EZF plays a role in differentiation of epithelial cells. Chromosomal mapping experiments showed that the mouse Ezf gene is located on mouse chromosome 4 in close proximity to the thioredoxin (Txn) gene. A mouse mutation called crinkly tail or cy which results in defects in the caudal vertebrae has been mapped to the same region of chromosome 4 (37Johnson D.R. Wallace M.E. J. Embryol. Exp. Morph. 1979; 53: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar). Although the EZF mRNA is transiently expressed in mesenchymal cells of the caudal vertebrae during embryonic development, it is unlikely that a mutation in the Ezf gene is responsible for the cy defect since abnormalities are seen in the tail of cy mice prior to the time at which the Ezf gene is expressed in that organ. The human EZF gene maps 2L. A. Garrett-Sinha, and B. de Crombrugghe, manuscript in preparation. to chromosome 9q22.3-31 a region which also contains the human thioredoxin (TXN) gene (38Heppell-Parton A. Cahn A. Bench A. Lowe N. Lehrach H. Zehetner G. Rabbitts P. Genomics. 1995; 26: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several human genetic diseases have been linked to that region of the genome including two syndromes involving skin tumors, basal cell nevus syndrome, and self-healing squamous epitheliomata (39Gailani M.R. Bale S.J. Leffell D.J. DiGiovanna J.J. Peck G.L. Poliak S. Drum M.A. Pastakia B. McBride O.W. Kase R. Greene M. Mulvihill J.J. Bale A.E.

Ferguson-Smith M.A. Nature Genet. 1993; 3: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these two syndromes are allelic since they are both characterized by skin tumors and map to similar regions of the genome (39Gailani M.R. Bale S.J. Leffell D.J. DiGiovanna J.J. Peck G.L. Poliak S. Drum M.A. Pastakia B. McBride O.W. Kase R. Greene M. Mulvihill J.J. Bale A.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 111-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). However, there are differences in the types of tumors which arise (basal cell carcinomas versus squamous cell carcinomas) as well as in other manifestations of these syndromes. There are also reports of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9q in sporadic basal and squamous cell carcinomas (39Gailani M.R. Bale S.J. Leffell D.J. DiGiovanna J.J. Peck G.L. Poliak S.

Basal cell nevus syndrome and sporadic basal cell carcinomas have recently been linked to mutations in a transmembrane protein patched involved in the hedgehog signaling pathway (44Hahn H. Wicking C. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Gailani M.R. Shanley S., Chidambaram A. Vorechovsky I. Holmberg E. Unden A.B. Gillies S. Negus K. Smyth I. Pressman C. Leffell D.J. Gerrard B. Goldstein A.M. Dean M. Toftgard R.

To date, however, mutations in patched have not been implicated in self-healing squamous epitheliomata or sporadic squamous cell cancers. It is possible that genes other than patched located in the 9q22.3-q31 region could function as tumor suppressors in squamous cell cancers. Since the Ezf gene maps to the correct segment of the genome and is expressed highly in epithelial cells of tissues in which squamous cell cancers arise, it may be involved in the development of these tumors. Further studies will be required to address this question. During the time this manuscript was under review, Shields et al. (46Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Wang V.W. J. Biol.

Its high overproduction in Pdr1p transcription factor mutants allows us to study the molecular mechanism of multidrug transport and substrate specificity. We have developed new in vivo and in vitro assays of Pdr5p-mediated drug transport. We show that in spite of little sequence homology, and inverted topology in respect to that of mammalian P-glycoproteins, Pdr5p shares with them common substrates. Pdr5p extrudes rhodamines 6G and 123, from intact yeast cells in an energy-dependent manner. Plasma membrane preparations from a Pdr5p-overproducing strain exhibit ATP hydrolysis-dependent, osmotically sensitive rhodamine 6G fluorescence quenching. The quenching is competitively inhibited by micromolar concentrations of many anticancer drugs, such as vinblastine, vincristine, taxol, and verapamil, and of ionophoric peptides as well as steroids. In contrast, other anticancer drugs, like colchicine and some multidrug resistance modifiers, such as quinidine, exert noncompetitive inhibition.

The PDR5 gene disruption was performed as described previously (7Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell.

The monogenic character of the disruption was verified by tetrad analysis. The URA3 gene was removed by 5-fluoro-orotic acid treatment (21Boeke J.D. Lacroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen.

The KpnI fragment was removed from the previously described, Yep24-based pDR3-3 plasmid (16Leppert G. McDevitt R. Falco S.C. Van Dyk T.K. Ficke M.B. Golin J. Genetics. 1990; 125: 13-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yielding pMKR3-3. The KpnI-BamHI fragment containing the entire PDR5 gene and its promoter was obtained by partial digestion of pMKR3-3 and cloned into the KpnI-BamHI sites in the polylinker of pRS315 vector (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) partially digested with KpnI and BamHI, yielding pMK315-5. Yeast transformation was carried by the lithium acetate procedure (23Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Cells grown on YPG medium, pH 6.8, were poured in top agar (seeded with 105 cells/ml) onto YPG plates (pH 6.8) of uniform thickness supplemented with 2% ethanol. Alternatively, the minimal YNB medium with 2% glycerol, 2% ethanol was used. Five μl of drug ethanol solution was spotted onto a Whatman paper disc lying on the top agar. The following amounts (in nanomoles) of drugs were applied: rhodamine 6G, 104; rhodamine 123, 263; oligomycin, 1.26; gramicidin D, 20 μg (about 9.7 nmol); CCCP, 100; FCCP, 25; valinomycin, 20; nigericin, 80; monensin, 100; ionophore A23187, 33; trifluoperazine, 210; tamoxifen, 116; daunomycin, 71; doxorubicin, 100; vinblastine, 75; vincristine, 11; verapamil, 307; taxol, 12; progesterone, 706; β-estradiol, 306; deoxycorticosterone, 862; puromycin, 92; nifedipine, 35; quinidine, 25; yohimbine, 284. Plates were incubated at 30°C until clear growth inhibition zones were visible. Ethanol alone did not affect growth. For each drug at least three reproducible measurements were done. Equal amounts of US50-18C and US50-D5 cells or of FY1679-28C and FYMK-1/1 (1 mg of total protein) from exponentially growing cultures (in the same medium as used for membrane preparations) were collected by centrifugation, washed 4 times with water, resuspended in 400 μl of 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mM 2 deoxy-D-glucose, 5 μM rhodamine 6G or 123, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. A 50-μl aliquot of this cell suspension (125 μg of total protein) was quickly spun down, washed twice with 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, resuspended in 2 ml of the same buffer at room temperature, and placed in the stirred fluorimeter cuvette. Rhodamine efflux was started by the addition of 1 mM glucose. Cells were removed by quick centrifugation 7 min after glucose addition, and rhodamine fluorescence was measured in the resulting supernatant using an SLM Aminco 48000 S spectrofluorimeter. For rhodamine 6G, the excitation wavelength was 529 nm (slit 4) and the emission wavelength 553 nm (slit 8). For rhodamine 123, these wavelengths were, respectively, 505 nm (slit 4) and 534 nm (slit 8). The excitation and emission spectra of rhodamine 6G were recorded at 2 nm excitation and emission slit widths. The CLS ATP bioluminescence assay (Boehringer Mannheim) was used to measure the ATP content in cell extracts, prepared according to the LKB bioluminescence assay instructions. Briefly, cell suspensions (prepared as described above) were diluted 50 times in boiling 0.1 M Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 7.75) and heated for 1 min. The resulting cell extracts were used for ATP determination in the integrating photometer 3000 of the SAI Technology Co. Cell viability was determined by counting colonies after plating on solid media and by the methylene blue exclusion method (24Pierce J. J. Inst. Brew. 1970; 76: 442-443Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 10% glucose, 2% yeast extract (Difco), pH 4.5, and harvested in the exponential phase of growth. After washing and disruption in a Braun MSK cell homogenizer in 10 mM Tris-NaOH (pH 10.5), 0.25 M saccharose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, unbroken cells, and cell debris were removed by low-speed centrifugation (2 × 1500 × g, 1 × 4300 × g). The resulting supernatants were centrifuged for 40 min at 20,200 × g. Pellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-acetic acid, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and mitochondrial membranes were removed by acetic acid precipitation at pH 5.2 and pelleting by 2.5-min centrifugation at 7700 × g, as described before (25Dufour J.P. Amory A. Goffeau A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 513-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The resulting supernatants were centrifuged for 36 min at 27,000 × g. Each pellet, highly enriched in plasma membranes, was resuspended in 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. The quality of the membranes was determined by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and by ATPase activity measurements, as described by Dufour et al. (25Dufour J.P. Amory A. Goffeau A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 513-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Membranes (30 μg of protein) were resuspended in 2 ml of 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 to 600 nM rhodamine 6G or 123, at 35°C. The reaction was started by addition of 5 mM ATP-NaOH, pH 7.0. Other parameters for fluorescence measurements were as described above for whole cells. Rhodamine 6G was used for inhibition kinetics measurements. Inhibitors were added as ethanol solutions. The ethanol concentration never exceeded 1%, and this solvent did not cause any measurable disturbances. The kinetic analysis of rhodamine 6G fluorescence quenching inhibitors was performed using the GraFit program (27Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar), assuming the model developed for P-glycoproteins by Michelson and Slate (28Michelson S. Slate D. Bull. Math. Biol. 1992; 54: 1023-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Trypsin digestion of plasma membrane fractions was carried out for 30 min in 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, with 250 μg/ml trypsin (1 μg of trypsin/mg protein). The method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine the protein concentration, using bovine serum albumin as standard. We have compared drug sensitivity of the pdr 1-3, mutant US50-18C, overproducing Pdr5p and the otherwise isogenic PDR5-deleted US50-D5 strains by agar diffusion assay. The former strain proved more resistant to growth inhibition by the fluorescent dyes rhodamine 6G, rhodamine 123, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin (Fig. 1). These dyes are well-known substrates of mammalian P-glycoproteins, the latter two used in chemotherapy. We further found that Pdr5p confers resistance to growth inhibition by the anticancer drug tamoxifen and also by the MDR modifier trifluoperazine (Fig. 1). Other anticancer drugs, such as vinblastine, vincristine, taxol, verapamil, colchicine, MDR modifiers, such as puromycin, nifedipine, and also gramicidin D were not toxic to our yeast strains under the conditions used. The effect of oligomycin and of the protonophores FCCP and CCCP was not appreciably modified by Pdr5p. In contrast, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, and the ionophoric peptides monensin and nigericin were less toxic in the Pdr5p-overproducing than in the PDR5-deleted strain (Fig. 1). Deletion of PDR5 increases also sensitivity to progesterone and deoxycorticosterone in contrast to β-estradiol which was not toxic (Fig. 1). The case of valinomycin is more curious. Initially, identical growth inhibition zones were observed for the PDR5-overexpressing and -deleted strains. Upon further incubation, however, the inhibition zone disappeared in the case of the PDR5-deleted strain, but remained unchanged in the case of the overexpressing strain (Fig. 1). That the phenotypes are related to Pdr5p was confirmed by complementation of PDR5 deletion in the FYMK-1/1 strain with PDR5 borne on a centromeric plasmid and by cosegregation of rhodamine 6G hypersensitivity with PDR5 deletion (data not shown). Rhodamines 6G and 123 are taken up by yeast cells and are commonly used to stain mitochondria (30Johnson L.V. Walsh M.L. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 88: 990-994Crossref Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). We found the dyes to accumulate much more abundantly in the strain with the disrupted PDR5 gene, as evidenced by fluorescence microscopy, by visual observations of red colonies on plates containing rhodamine 6G, and by the red color of sedimented cell pellets after addition of rhodamine to liquid cultures (data not shown). Prolonged incubation of the cells in the presence of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (a glycolysis inhibitor) and rhodamine 6G (a mitochondrial ATP-synthase inhibitor) resulted in marked depletion of the intracellular ATP pool from 10 to 1 nmol of ATP/mg of cell proteins and in an almost equal loading of PDR5-overexpressing and PDR5-deleted cells with the dye, as addition of equal amounts of preloaded cells produced fluorescence signals of similar intensity (Fig. 2A). The survival rate was similar for both strains after this incubation, as observed by vital staining and cell plating. The active Pdr5p-mediated extrusion of rhodamine 6G from intact cells was measured indirectly by monitoring glucose-stimulated fluorescence dequenching in de-energized, dye-preloaded cells (Fig. 2A) and by directly measuring the fluorescence of extruded rhodamine in the assay buffer (Fig. 2B). Addition of the energy source (glucose) caused the intracellular ATP level to rapidly increase up to 8 nmol of ATP/mg of protein in both strains. This was accompanied by rapid dequenching of rhodamine 6G fluorescence in the case of the Pdr5p-expressing cells but not in the case of the otherwise isogenic PDR5 disruptant (Fig. 2A). A parallel increase in rhodamine 6G fluorescence was observed in the external buffer after incubation of Pdr5p-expressing cells with glucose, as compared to controls where either Pdr5p or glucose was absent (Fig. 2B). The excitation and emission spectra of rhodamine 6G observed before cell loading and after extrusion were indistinguishable (data not shown). FY1679-28C was also found to extrude rhodamine 6G at a higher rate than FYMK-1/1 (data not shown). Pdr5p-producing cells were found to extrude rhodamine 123 at a higher rate than PDR5 disruptants (data not shown). These results, together with the in vivo drug sensitivity results, identify Pdr5p as an efficient cell detoxification system, which can be inhibited by depletion of the intracellular ATP pool. Further characterization of Pdr5p activity was done with a plasma membrane-enriched fraction containing the transporter in high amount, as shown in Fig. 3. Rapid quenching of rhodamine 6G fluorescence by Pdr5p-containing membranes occurred in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP. This quenching was not observed when membranes from the isogenic PDR5 disruptant were used (Fig. 4), although they appeared to be of the same quality, as revealed by similar SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles (Fig. 3) and similar H+-ATPase activity (data not shown). The reaction leading to rhodamine 6G fluorescence quenching was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of oligomycin and micromolar concentrations of vanadate, these being known inhibitors of Pdr5p ATPase activity (6Decottignies A. Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was also inhibited by a wide variety of mammalian MDR P-glycoprotein substrates, including the anticancer drugs vinblastine, vincristine, verapamil, and taxol at micromolar concentrations. When these inhibitors were added after rhodamine 6G quenching had reached a steady state, dequenching of fluorescence was observed as shown in Fig. 4 for oligomycin. Oligomycin at this concentration did not affect the rhodamine 6G fluorescence in the absence of Pdr5p. The rate of dequenching was proportional to the inhibitor concentration. When the inhibitor was added together with ATP before the start of the reaction, quenching occurred at a decreased rate, inversely proportional to the inhibitor concentration, as shown for tamoxifen in Fig. 5. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue ATPγS (31Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could not substitute for ATP and was inhibitory in the presence of ATP, suggesting that hydrolysis of ATP is required to energize the reaction. Furthermore, rhodamine 6G fluorescence quenching was fully relieved by addition of detergent at low concentrations, such as 1.45 mM octyl glucoside, 0.1 mM sodium deoxycholate, or 0.005% Triton X-100. This shows that the dye was neither degraded nor modified. The process responsible for fluorescence quenching was not inhibited by 10 mM sodium azide, 100 mM potassium nitrate, or by protonophores such as 10 μM CCCP, 10 μM FCCP, 1 μM S13, 1 μM SF6847, added either before addition of ATP or after the steady state was reached. Quenching of rhodamine 6G fluorescence was completely abolished by a 30-min preincubation of the membranes with trypsin. Rhodamine 6G and rhodamine 123 had similar responses (data not shown).Fig. 4Fig. 4. MgATP-dependent, Pdr5p-mediated quenching of rhodamine 6G fluorescence in plasma membrane fractions. Plasma membranes (30 μg of protein) from US50-18C or US50-D5 strains were placed in a cuvette, and fluorescence was recorded as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Oligomycin (1 μM) was added as indicated. The small initial decrease of fluorescence intensity after ATP addition (as indicated) is partly due to dilution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Fig. 5.

(32Horio M. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3580-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Then the assay was performed at the same concentration of sucrose as that of preincubated membrane suspension. Fig. 6A shows that the Pdr5p-mediated, MgATP-dependent rhodamine 6G quenching reaction is osmotically sensitive. Its optimal temperature is 35°C (Fig. 6B). The rhodamine 6G quenching reaction shows narrow optimum at pH 7 (Fig. 6C) and shows a clear preference for MgATP as energy source (Fig. 6D) with no activity observed without magnesium and with MgADP. The rate of rhodamine 6G fluorescence quenching in Pdr5p-enriched plasma membrane fractions reached a plateau value at rhodamine 6G concentrations above 400 nM (Fig. 7). Michaelis-Menten kinetics revealed an apparent Km of Pdr5p for rhodamine 6G of 144 nM. Each tested inhibitor of rhodamine 6G fluorescence quenching was kinetically characterized. Some inhibitors displayed competitive, others noncompetitive inhibition (Fig. 7, A and B). These inhibitors did not affect the rhodamine 6G fluorescence in the absence of Pdr5p. For each tested inhibitor, we determined the I50 concentration at the rhodamine 6G concentration of 146 nM, as shown for tamoxifen in Fig. 5.

Open table in a new tab Using our newly developed assays based on in vitro rhodamine 6G fluorescence measurements and in vivo drug sensitivity, we show that in spite of little sequence homology to the mammalian P-glycoproteins and inverted topology, the yeast multidrug transporter Pdr5p shares with them common substrates and inhibitors. The in vitro assay allowed us to kinetically characterize 22 inhibitors of the Pdr5p-mediated fluorescence quenching of rhodamine 6G. We first identified, on the basis of in vivo toxicity assays performed on PDR5-deleted and -expressing strains, toxic compounds likely to be transported by Pdr5p such as the fluorescent dyes rhodamine 6G and rhodamine 123, the anticancer drugs daunorubicin, doxorubicin, tamoxifen, the chemosensitizer trifluoperazine, the ionophores nigericin, monensin, and A23187, and the steroid hormones progesterone and deoxycorticosterone. The fact that other anticancer drugs such as vinblastine or colchicine did not prove toxic to our yeast strains is not surprising, since others have made similar observations (1Kuchler K. Sterne R. Thorner J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3973-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observed Pdr5p- and energy-dependent extrusion of rhodamine 6G and rhodamine 123 from intact yeast cel"
https://openalex.org/W2152541148,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of excitatory glutamate receptors plays critical roles in embryonic and adult synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system. The receptor is a heteromultimer of core subunits, NR1, and one or more regulatory subunits, NR2A-D. Protein phosphorylation can regulate NMDA receptor function (Lieberman, D. N., and Mody, I. (1994) Nature 369, 235-239; Wang, Y. T., and Salter, M. W. (1994) Nature 369, 233-235; Wang, L.-Y., Orser, B. A., Brautigan, D. L., and MacDonald, J. F. (1994) Nature 369, 230-232). Here we identify a major phosphorylation site on subunit NR2B that is phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II), an abundant protein kinase located at postsynaptic sites in glutamatergic synapses. For the initial identification of the site, we constructed a recombinant fusion protein containing 334 amino acids of the C terminus of the NR2B subunit and phosphorylated it with CaM kinase II in vitro. By peptide mapping, automated sequencing, and mass spectrometry, we identified the major site of phosphorylation on the fusion protein as Ser-383, corresponding to Ser-1303 of full-length NR2B. The Km for phosphorylation of this site in the fusion protein was ∼50 nM, much lower than that of other known substrates for CaM kinase II, suggesting that the receptor is a high affinity substrate. We show that serine 1303 in the full-length NR2B and/or the cognate site in NR2A is a major site of phosphorylation of the receptor both in the postsynaptic density fraction and in living hippocampal neurons.

These changes include long term potentiation (2Morris R.G.M. Anderson E. Lynch G.S. Baudry M. Nature. 1986; 319: 774-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar) and long term depression (3Dudek S.M. Bear M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4363-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). NMDA receptors contain two classes of subunits in hetero-oligomeric associations, the core NR1 subunit and the regulatory NR2 (A-D) subunits (4Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar, 5Seeburg P.H. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The NR2 subunits are equipped with uniquely long carboxyl-terminal tails that are believed to extend into the cytoplasm (6Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R. Herb A. Higuchi M. Lomeli H. Burnashev N. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar). These tails may participate in transduction mechanisms or in forms of regulation of the NMDA receptor that are not yet fully understood. NR2A and NR2B are the major regulatory subunits of NMDA receptors in the forebrain (4Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar, 5Seeburg P.H. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Previous work from this laboratory has shown that NR2B is the principal NMDA receptor subunit found in the postsynaptic density fraction prepared from forebrain (7Moon I.S. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), suggesting that this subunit may participate in anchoring the NMDA receptor at postsynaptic sites. Indeed, recent work from our lab and the Seeburg lab (8Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar) has demonstrated a direct association between NR2B and the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95.

NMDA receptors are ligand and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (9Nowak L. Bregestovski P. Ascher P. Herbet A. Prochiantz A.

Binding of glutamate released from the presynaptic terminal, coupled with strong depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane produces an influx of Ca2+ into the postsynaptic compartment (11Mayer M.L. MacDermott A.B. Westbrook G.L. Smith S.J. Barker J.L. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3230-3244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Ca2+ influx initiates a wide array of biochemical events in the synapse that can lead to long term potentiation or long term depression (12Lynch G. Larson J. Kelso S. Barrionuevo G. Schottler F.

One potential target for immediate activation by this Ca2+ influx is CaM kinase II. CaM kinase II has long been known to be concentrated in the postsynaptic density (14Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K.

Science. 1994; 266: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). One target for regulation by CaM kinase II at the postsynaptic site may be the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-type glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 (21McGlade-McCulloh E. Yamamoto H. Tan S.-E. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1993; 362: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), although uncertainty about the topology of receptor folding has cast some doubt on the significance of direct phosphorylation of GluR1 in vivo (22Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Another potential target for phosphorylation is the NMDA receptor itself. Indeed, electrophysiological evidence indicates that NMDA receptor-mediated currents can be enhanced by protein phosphorylation (23Lieberman D.N. Mody I. Nature. 1994; 369: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 24Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 25Wang L.-Y.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 415-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, direct demonstration of the role of phosphorylation of the receptor itself in regulating its function requires identification of sites on the receptor subunits that are phosphorylated by particular protein kinases. Sites of phosphorylation of NR1 by protein kinase C have been located in the alternatively spliced C-terminal region, and their role in regulating receptor function in vitro has been demonstrated (27Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a principal site of phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor by CaM kinase II. We show that this site and/or its cognate site in NR2A is phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo.

Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) as described previously (7Moon I.S. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). A single colony of E. coli cells transformed with the plasmid was selected on an LB plate containing ampicillin and was grown in cultures containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 30°C overnight. When 2-liter cultures reached mid-log phase (A600 of 0.5 units), the cells were induced by adding 0.1 mM isopropyl-thiogalactoside and grown to late log phase at 30°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were frozen at −80°C. The cell pellet from a 2-liter culture was resuspended in 20 ml of 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.3. (phosphate-buffered saline) containing 0.02 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 0.4 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA. Cells were lysed by sonication. PMSF was added again to a concentration of 0.1 mM, and Triton X-100 was added to a concentration of 1%. The cell lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% n-lauroyl sarcosine (33Grieco F. Hay J.B. Hull R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 856-857PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.1 mM PMSF. The pellet was sonicated, and Triton X-100 and PMSF were added to concentrations of 1% and 0.1 mM, respectively. The suspension was subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g. This and previous supernatants were pooled and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with 2 ml of glutathione-agarose beads previously washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The supernatant solution was removed from the beads, and the beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were then mixed with elution buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mM reduced glutathione, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mM PMSF overnight at 4°C on an end-over-end mixer. The eluate was removed from the beads and stored at −80°C. Additional fusion protein could be recovered from the first bead supernatant by a second round of affinity purification. Phosphorylation of the fusion protein was conducted as described previously (34Miller S.G. Patton B.L. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1988; 1: 604-1593Google Scholar). The reaction (final volume 100 μl) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.7 mM CaCl2, 0.4 mM EGTA, 30 μM [γ-32P]ATP (1500-3000 cpm/pmol), 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 mM DTT, GST-tNR2B, and 1.2 μg/ml rat brain CaM kinase II. Phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of kinase solution in Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5-1.0 mg/ml BSA, to the reaction mixture, which was prewarmed to 30°C for 1 min. The reaction was carried out for 1 min or as indicated and was stopped by the addition of either 50 μl of 3 × SDS sample buffer or 4 μl of 500 mM EDTA. When the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS, the mixture was placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min before SDS-PAGE. GST-tNR2B was phosphorylated as described above with the following modifications. The reaction was conducted in a volume of 1 ml containing 16 or 54 μg/ml GST-tNR2B. The reaction mix was preincubated for 5 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.2 μg of CaM kinase II. After 15 min, another 1.5 μg of CaM kinase II (in 0.5 μl) was added, and the reaction continued for 15 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 19 mM. Several reactions were pooled into 6-8-ml batches and placed on ice. Protein was precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 16%. After 1 h on ice, protein was pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were washed twice with acetone to remove traces of trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were then dried in air and redissolved in 100-250 μl of carboxymethylation buffer containing 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 M urea, 2 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT. The tubes were flushed with nitrogen to remove air and incubated at 50°C for 30 min to reduce cysteine residues. To carboxymethylate the cysteine residues, iodoacetamide, pH 8.0, was added to a final concentration of 4.5 mM, and the tubes were then flushed with nitrogen and incubated at 50°C for 1 h, protected from light. 2-Mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v), and the tubes were incubated at 50°C for 10 min to quench excess iodoacetamide. The reaction mixtures were then diluted to a final concentration of 2 M urea, and protein was precipitated by the addition of a final concentration of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After 15 min on ice, protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were washed twice with acetone to remove traces of trichloroacetic acid, air-dried for 10 min, redissolved in 1 × SDS-sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (1.5 mm thick). The GST-tNR2B bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. The bands were cut out of the gel and washed twice in 10 ml each of 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 3 h, 10 ml of 50% methanol overnight, 10 ml of 20% isopropyl alcohol for 1 h, and again in 10 ml of 50% methanol for 30 min. The bands were then lyophilized to dryness. Each band, containing about 50 μg of GST-tNR2B, was reswollen in 0.9 ml of 0.1 M NH4HCO3 and was homogenized using a mini homogenizer and pestle (Kontes Scientific Glassware/Instruments). Modified sequencing grade trypsin (25-30 μg in 1 mM DTT) was added to each gel suspension, the final volume was brought to 1 ml, and the tubes were incubated in a 37°C shaker water bath for 24 h. After trypsinization, each gel suspension was pelleted by brief centrifugation, and the supernatant (∼0.6 ml) containing peptides was transferred to a fresh tube. The gel pellets were washed with 0.4 ml of 0.1 M NH4HCO3, and the washes were added to the previous supernatants. An additional 5 μg of sequencing grade trypsin was added to each supernatant along with fresh DTT to a final concentration of 1 mM, and the tubes were incubated in a 37°C shaker water bath for another 13 h. The supernatant was then lyophilized to dryness. To recover additional peptides, 1 ml of 0.1 M NH4HCO3, 1 mM DTT containing 6 μg of sequencing grade trypsin was added to the gel pellets, and they were incubated at 37°C for another 13 h. Sequencing grade trypsin (3 μg) and 1 mM DTT were added to the supernatants, and they were incubated at 37°C for an additional 8 h. The final supernatants were pooled with the lyophilized peptides from the previous supernatants and again lyophilized to dryness. Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and fractionated in two batches by HPLC on a C18 reverse phase column (4.1 × 250 mm). The column was developed at 1 ml/min with a gradient of 0-42% acetonitrile. Absorbance at 214 nm was monitored, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Radioactivity in each fraction was measured in a Beckman LS 7800 scintillation counter by detection of Cerenkov radiation (34Miller S.G. Patton B.L. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1988; 1: 604-1593Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry was conducted by the Protein/Peptide Micro Analytical Laboratory at Caltech with a PerSeptive Biosystems/Vestec Lasertech II reflector for matrix-assisted, laser desorption ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Concentrated peak fractions of peptides were mixed with an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution, dried, and placed in the mass spectrometer. Data were collected in both linear and reflector modes. Amino acid sequencing was performed in the Protein/Peptide MicroAnalytical Laboratory with a Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems Inc. model 476A automatic protein sequenator. The postsynaptic density fraction was phosphorylated by endogenous CaM kinase II in the assay solution described above without the addition of exogenous kinase. For Fig. 1, the reaction was carried out with [γ-32P]ATP (4500 cpm/pmol) for 2 min. For generation of tryptic peptides, the reaction was carried out with [γ-32P]ATP (60,000 cpm/pmol) for 2 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of a final concentration of 0.2% SDS and boiled for 3 min. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by the addition of RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) and rabbit antiserum against NR2B (final dilution 1:20 in a volume of 0.2 or 0.8 ml). The final SDS concentration was 0.1%. The antibody solutions were mixed in the cold room for 2-12 h, cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, mixed with protein A-agarose beads previously washed with 1 × RIPA buffer, and stirred again for 2 h in the cold room. The protein A beads were then pelleted and washed three times with 2 volumes of 1 × RIPA buffer. SDS sample buffer (50-100 μl/200 μl of protein A beads) was added to the beads. The mixture was boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 6% gel. The NR2B bands were visualized by either Coomassie staining or autoradiography. The NR2B bands were excised and were subjected to tryptic peptide mapping as for GST-tNR2B except that the carboxymethylation was omitted. A synthetic peptide with the sequence LRRQHSYDTFVC was obtained from the Peptide Sequencing Facility at Caltech. Ten mg was phosphorylated for 2 h at 30°C in 44 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 9 mM MgCl2, 0.35 mM EGTA, 0.6 mM CaCl2, 0.26 mg/ml calmodulin, 2.2 mM DTT, 13.2 mM [γ-35S]thiophospho-ATP (1000 cpm/nmol), 0.53 mg/ml CaM kinase II in a final volume of 0.85 ml. The solution was brought to 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid, and the phosphopeptide was purified by HPLC and conjugated via succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Rabbit antisera were raised as described previously (7Moon I.S. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) by repeated injection of 0.33 mg of conjugated peptide in RIBI adjuvant (RIBI Immunochemical Research Inc., Hamilton, MT) at several sites. Serum was collected and tested on immunoblots as described below against 0.2 μg of phosphorylated and 0.2 μg of nonphosphorylated GST-tNR2B. The serum of one rabbit showed good specificity for phospho-GST-tNR2B. To neutralize antibodies against nonphosphorylated GST-tNR2B, the serum was preabsorbed with 6 mol eq of the nonphosphorylated antigen peptide at 4°C overnight before dilution for use on immunoblots. Nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated rat brain homogenates were prepared as follows. A rat brain was homogenized in 14 ml of homogenization buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM imidazole, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 25 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF with eight strokes in a Teflon/glass homogenizer rotated at 900 rpm. The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. Two ml of homogenate was incubated for 1 h at 30°C to permit dephosphorylation of proteins by endogenous phosphatases. One ml was then removed and brought to 3% SDS, 5% glycerol, 2%β-mercaptoethanol, and 62 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7 (SDS-PAGE sample buffer). The other ml of dephosphorylated homogenate was added to an equal volume of prewarmed phosphorylation mixture containing (final volume) 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.7 mM CaCl, 0.3 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl, 5 mg/ml calmodulin, 10 mM ATP, 10 mM DTT, 0.06 mg/ml CaM kinase II, and 1 mM okadaic acid to inhibit protein phosphatases. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 30°C and then brought to 3% SDS, 5% glycerol, 2%β-mercaptoethanol, and 62 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7. Aliquots of both the nonphosphorylated and the phosphorylated homogenates were boiled for 2 min and stored at −80°C for later application to SDS-PAGE gels. Homogenates of hippocampal slices were prepared as described previously (35Kindler S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1996; 68: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from rat brains and placed in ice-cold, oxygenated Ringer buffer (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose). Slices (500 μm) were cut with a tissue chopper (Stolting, Wood Dale, Il), placed on filter paper on top of a Petri dish containing oxygenated, ice-cold Ringer buffer, and incubated at room temperature in a chamber flushed continuously with 95% O2, 5% CO2. After 1 h, groups of 12 slices were immersed in oxygenated Ringer buffer or in the same buffer containing either 5 μM okadaic acid or 0 CaCl2/0.25 mM EGTA, for an additional hour at room temperature in a 95% O2, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The slices were then immediately transferred to a Teflon/glass homogenizer containing 600 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer plus 2 units of DNase and homogenized. Each homogenate was boiled for 5 min and frozen for later application to SDS-PAGE gels. For detection of the phosphorylated site in homogenates, 25-40 μg of homogenate protein/lane was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked for 5 h in 5% dry milk (Carnation) diluted in TTBS (0.05% Tween-20, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl). After one wash in TTBS, blots were incubated overnight in anti-phosphosite-specific rabbit serum preabsorbed with nonphosphoantigen as described above and then diluted 1:2000 in TTBS plus 1% normal goat serum. Blots were washed three times in TTBS, then incubated for 1 h in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunochemicals) diluted in TTBS plus 1% normal goat serum. After three 10-min washes with TTBS, blots were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the supplier's instructions. Organotypic hippocampal cultures were prepared and maintained for 4-6 weeks as described previously (36Patton B.L. Molloy S.S. Kennedy M.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ten wells containing 4 or 5 cultures/well were washed with minimal essential medium containing 100 μM Na2HPO4, prewarmed to 37°C. Then 1 ml of the same medium containing 0.8 mCi of carrier free 32P-phosphate was added to each well. The plates were transferred to a 37°C CO2 incubator for 8 h. At the end of the incubation, the labeling medium was aspirated off. The slices were washed twice with Ringer buffer (125 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), frozen on dry ice on glass slides, and transferred to a −70°C freezer overnight. The slices were thawed on ice and homogenized in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM imidazole, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, 2 mM EGTA) at 900 rpm with eight strokes. The homogenate was brought to 0.2% SDS, placed in a boiling water bath for 3 min, cooled in ice, and brought to 1 × RIPA buffer, 0.1% SDS (final volume 2 ml). The sample was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min and then mixed with 100 μl of antiserum against NR2B in the cold room for 2 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads (2-ml suspension), washed once with RIPA buffer were added, and the incubation continued for 2 h in the cold room with mixing. The protein A beads were then pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer. SDS sample buffer (0.25-0.5 ml) was added to the washed beads and boiled for 5 min, and the mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 6% gel. The NR2B bands were visualized by autoradiography after drying the gel, excised, and subjected to tryptic digestion as described above for GST-tNR2B. Lyophilized tryptic peptides were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile, spotted onto 20 × 20-cm cellulose-coated thin layer plates, and fractionated in two dimensions (37Boyle W. Vandergaer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis in the first dimension was at 600 V for 4 h, in a pH 3.5 buffer containing 5% acetic acid and 0.5% pyridine. The plates were dried and subjected to thin layer chromatography in the second dimension in a solvent containing n-butanol, pyridine, acetic acid, and water in the ratio 37.5:25:7.5:30. Phosphopeptides were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Organotypic hippocampal cultures were prepared and washed as described above and then incubated in minimal essential medium containing 100 μM NaH2PO4 and 1 mCi of [γ-32P]H3PO4 for 16 h at 37°C. The slices were then washed twice with Ringer buffer and homogenized in 600 μl of homogenization buffer with eight strok"

Promoter regions for these genes contain a motif that closely resembles the “classic” NFκB consensus site. Immunoblot analysis identified NFκB1 (p50), RelA (p65), and c-Rel in RSF. Upon IL-1β-stimulation, p65 and c-Rel but not p50 protein levels were reduced suggesting nuclear translocation. IL-1β-induced RSF nuclear extracts contained a p65-containing complex, which bound to the classical NFκB consensus motif.

Utilization of antisense technology showed that p65 but not p50 or c-Rel mediated IL-1β-stimulated PGE2 formation. Treated RSF could not transcribe COX II or 85-kDa PLA2 mRNA, which reduced their respective proteins. Interestingly, stimulated IL-8 production was not inhibited by the classical NFκB decoy but was reduced by treatment with antisense to both p65 and c-Rel supporting preferential binding of c-Rel-p65 to the “alternative” IL-8 κB motif. Taken together, these data provide the first direct evidence for a role of p65 in COX II and 85-kDa PLA2 gene induction and support the IL-1 activation and participation of distinct NFκB protein dimers in RSF prostanoid and IL-8 formation.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 6986-6993PubMed Google Scholar). 5′-flanking regulatory regions for both the human 85-kDa PLA2 and COX II genes have recently been isolated (17Morii H. Ozaki M. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Inoue H. Nanayama T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and sequence analysis has identified a number of possible transcription factor consensus binding motifs, including NFκB. The putative NFκB motif in the 85-kDa PLA2 promoter is located at −1099 base pairs (17Morii H. Ozaki M. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas the NFκB consensus site in the human COX II promoter is located at −233 base pairs (18Inoue H. Nanayama T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). NFκB is a dimeric DNA binding protein comprised of members of the NFκB/Rel/dorsal family of proteins including the mammalian forms, NFκB1 (p50), NFκB2 (p52), RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel (10Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 11Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). NFκB proteins are capable of forming numerous homodimers and heterodimers with other family members, and this conveys a degree of NFκB gene target specificity. In addition, the different dimeric pairs bind to different NFκB DNA motifs with varying affinities, again permitting specificity (19Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 20Parry G.C.N. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20823-20825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These motifs can be subdivided into two main categories, the “classic”κB consensus site (GGGRNNTYCC) and the “alternative” or κB-like motif ((T/A/C)GGARNYYCC). Reports demonstrated that different homodimer or heterodimer pairs exhibit varied affinity for these two motif classes. The p50-p65 heterodimer has been shown to bind preferentially to the decameric oligonucleotide sequence (GGGACTTTCC) present in Ig κ-light chain enhancer (20Parry G.C.N. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20823-20825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NFκB motifs present in the 85-kDa PLA2 (GGGAATTCTC) and COX II (GGGACTACCC) promoters most closely resemble classic κB consensus motifs. In contrast, the alternative motif, present in promoters such as IL-8, intercellular adhesion molecule, and tissue factor, binds c-Rel-p65 heterodimers with higher affinity than p50-p65 (20Parry G.C.N. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20823-20825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded NFκB decoys are an effective approach to specifically modulate expression of NFκB-driven reporter genes through successful competition of the decoy with the authentic DNA motifs, preventing dimer translocation and/or DNA binding (21Tanaka H. Vickart P. Bertrand J.R. Rayner B. Morvan F. Imbach J.L. Pavlin D. Malvy C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3069-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, antisense technology has been successfully used to modulate NFκB proteins to assess their role in the transcriptional control of a variety of genes, such as the elucidation of a role for p65 but not p50 in IL-8 expression (14Kunsch C. Rosen C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6137-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrate that IL-1β induces the activation of NFκB in human RSF and that modulation of NFκB activation using the tools described above interferes with prostanoid formation and transcriptional up-regulation of 85-kDa PLA2 and COX II. Primary cultures of human RSF were obtained from 10 adult patients and maintained in culture as described previously (6Roshak A. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Rheum. 1995; 23: 420-427Google Scholar, 22Roshak A. Sathe G. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For some studies, fibroblasts were plated at 5 × 104 cells/ml in 16-mm (diameter) 24-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and used when confluent. In studies using antisense, the medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was removed and serum-free medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and sodium selenite (Sigma) was added. Cells were exposed to IL-1β (1 ng/ml, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) for the designated time (6Roshak A. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Rheum. 1995; 23: 420-427Google Scholar) after which PGE2 levels or IL-8 levels in cell-free medium were measured using enzyme immunoassay purchased (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI and Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) as described previously (6Roshak A. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Rheum. 1995; 23: 420-427Google Scholar). In some studies cells were first treated with NFκB decoys (4 h at 37°C) or antisense (18 h at 37°C) prior to the addition of IL-1β for 8 or 24 h. Initiation site-directed antisense to p65 (SK68), 5′-ggggaacagttcgtccatggc-3′; p50 (SB70), 5′-tggatcttctgccattct-3′; c-Rel (SB7221), 3′-tacgcaccggaggccatggct-5′; control oligonucleotide p50 sense (SB71), 5′-agaatggcagaagatcca-3′; and a scrambled oligonucleotide (SB7222), 5′-ttaccgcgccgtagacgggca-3′ (14Kunsch C. Rosen C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6137-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were synthesized on a 380A DNA synthesizer from Applied Biosystems using phosphoramidite chemistry as described previously (6Roshak A. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Rheum. 1995; 23: 420-427Google Scholar, 22Roshak A. Sathe G. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded NFκB consensus motifs (decoys) were first synthesized as single-stranded 22-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (NFκB decoy, 5′-agttgaggggactttcccaggc-3′; mutant decoy, 5′-agttgaggcgactttcccaggc-3′) and then annealed according to standard protocols. Oligonucleotides and decoys were added as a complex with Lipofectin (5 μg/ml of culture medium, Life Technologies Inc.) (6Roshak A. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Rheum. 1995; 23: 420-427Google Scholar, 22Roshak A. Sathe G. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human RSF were trypsinized, resuspended to 1.0 × 108 cells/ml in homogenization buffer, and disrupted on ice by sonication, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C to obtain a supernatant (cytosol) and particulate fraction as described previously (6Roshak A. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Rheum. 1995; 23: 420-427Google Scholar). Cell fractions (25-40 μg protein/lane) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gels, Bio-Rad) and visualized using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Corp.). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the recombinant human 85-kDa PLA2 or rabbit anti-human COX II (kindly donated by D. Dewitt (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI)) was used as described previously (6Roshak A. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Rheum. 1995; 23: 420-427Google Scholar, 22Roshak A. Sathe G. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 24-h lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocyte particulate fraction was used as a positive control for the COX II protein. Recombinant human 85-kDa PLA2 was cloned and expressed as described previously (6Roshak A. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Rheum. 1995; 23: 420-427Google Scholar) and used as a protein standard. Rabbit polyclonal antisera against NFκB proteins p50, p65, and c-Rel were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extracts of RSF were prepared according to published methods (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar, 24Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, treated and control cells were removed by addition of trypsin/EDTA and then pelleted on ice. 107 cells were resuspended in 20 μl of Buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 10 min, and nuclei were pelleted by microcentrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was suspended in 15 μl of Buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and gently mixed for 20 min at 4°C. The sample was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the decanted supernatant was diluted to 75 μl with Buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were stored at −80°C until analyzed. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the sequence corresponding to the classical NFκB consensus site (5′-agttgaggggactttcccagcc-3′, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). EMSAs were performed using the classical κB motif, which most closely represented the putative NFκB sites in the promoters of both COX II and 85-kDa PLA2. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using two Sephadex G-50 columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Binding reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl consisting of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mM Tris-HCl 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2-10 μg of nuclear extract, and 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (∼50,000 cpm) with or without unlabeled competitor (20-40-fold excess). The Oct-1 consensus sequence, 5′-tgtcgaatgcaaatcactagaa-3′, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. In “supershift” studies, 1 μg rabbit anti-p50, anti-p65, or anti-c-Rel serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Binding reactions were subjected to nondenaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis through 4% gels in a 1 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer system. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Total RNA was isolated from RSF using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equal concentrations of RNA (20 μg/lane) were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. Following electrophoresis, gels were rinsed, transferred to Hybond N+ (Amersham Corp.) by vacuum blotting (Bio-Rad) in 10 × SSC according to manufacturer's protocol, and RNA was fixed to the membrane by UV cross-linking (0.12 J/cm2). RNA samples were visualized by staining with 0.02% methylene blue (5 min) and destained in distilled water (15 min). Equal loading was verified by quantitation of ribosomal RNA bands. Hybridizations, following standard prehybridization treatment, were done in prehybridization solution (10 ml/blot) containing 20 ng of denatured specific DNA probe labeled to 1-2 × 109 dpm/μg with 32P (see below) at 68°C for 18 h. Following hybridization, blots were washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68°C and and once with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68°C and once with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68°C. Filters were analyzed and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The 85-kDa PLA2 probe was the full-length cDNA (2.87 kilobases) and the COX II probe was a 1.2-kilobase EcoRI fragment of the murine COX II cDNA clone kindly provided by Dr. David DeWitt, Michigan State University. 20 ng of cDNA was labeled using a Rediprime kit and 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Quick Spin columns (Boehringer Mannheim). All studies were performed using RSF from two to five different individuals. Data represent mean ± standard deviation (S.D.), n = 3, and subjected to one way analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range test (p < 0.05) for statistical evaluation where indicated. Confluent RSF in T-75 flasks were placed in serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium for 24 h prior to incubation in the presence of vehicle or IL-1β for 0, 15, or 30 min at 37°C. Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by EMSA as described under “Materials and Methods.”Fig. 1A shows that a protein complex that binds to the 32P-labeled NFκB classical sequence is present in nuclear extracts of unstimulated and stimulated RSF. IL-1β stimulation of the RSF increased the nuclear levels of the protein complex in a time-dependent manner. The 15-min time point was chosen for subsequent NFκB activation studies because it routinely displayed a 2-3-fold increase in NFκB binding activity as assessed by scanning gel densitometry (area pixel values for Fig. 1,: control, 945; IL-1β (15 min), 1909; IL-1β (30 min), 1100: area pixel values for a similar study: control, 1179; IL-1β (15 min), 3773). Specific binding to the NFκB classical motif was demonstrated when labeled probe binding was inhibited by incubation with excess unlabeled NFκB consensus oligonucleotide (20×) but not by an excess of the unrelated Oct-1 oligonucleotide (20×) (Fig. 1B). Use of the COX II κB motif gave identical EMSA results (data not shown). Therefore, the classical motif was used for all subsequent studies. To determine the presence of p50, p65, or c-Rel in RSF, confluent cells were placed in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to exposure to vehicle or IL-1β (1 ng/ml) for 15 min. After the indicated time, cells were pelleted, and cytosolic fractions or nuclear extracts were prepared as described. Western blot analysis of cytosolic fractions (30 μg) confirmed the presence all three NFκB proteins in unstimulated control RSF (Fig. 2). Exposure to IL-1β resulted in 75 and 43% reductions in cytosolic levels of p65 and c-Rel, respectively, as measured by scanning gel densitometry (area pixel values: p65 nontreated control, 591; p65 IL-1 treated, 157: c-Rel nontreated control, 675; c-Rel IL-1 treated, 388). However, stimulation with IL-1 did not alter p50 over this time frame because there was no detectable change in p50 immunoreactive protein levels (p50 untreated control, 864; p50 IL-1 treated, 938). In order to evaluate the presence of NFκB proteins in control and treated RSF nuclear extracts, supershift EMSA analysis was performed using radiolabeled classic NFκB motif and antiserum specific for p50, p65, or c-Rel. Fig. 3 shows one representative supershift EMSA. Exposure of RSF to IL-1 resulted in the appearance of an NFκB binding complex, which could be supershifted by antiserum to p65. Neither antiserum specific for p50 nor that specific for c-Rel induced a supershift in either control or stimulated nuclear extracts using the conditions described in this study. In the case of c-Rel, the lack of binding affinity for c-Rel containing dimers to classical NFκB could also account for the lack of a supershift (20Parry G.C.N. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20823-20825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that the antibodies recognize epitopes that are concealed by DNA binding cannot be ruled out. Double-stranded oligonucleotide decoys (22-mers) containing the classic NFκB consensus site or a mutant NFκB consensus site were prepared by phosphoramidite chemistry, annealed, and complexed to Lipofectin as described under “Materials and Methods.” RSF in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and sodium selenite were incubated with the NFκB decoy (0.3-3.0 μM), the mutant decoy (3.0 μM), or Lipofectin vehicle alone for 4 h at 37°C (21Tanaka H. Vickart P. Bertrand J.R. Rayner B. Morvan F. Imbach J.L. Pavlin D. Malvy C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3069-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) prior to the addition of IL-1β (18 h, 37°C). Cells were monitored throughout the study, and no greater cytotoxity was observed in the treated groups compared with the untreated controls as assessed by morphology, adherence, and trypan blue exclusion. Fig. 4A shows that the NFκB decoy but not the mutant decoy concentration-dependently reduced IL-1β-induced PGE2 formation. Pretreatment of IL-1β-stimulated cells with either 1.0 or 3.0 μM NFκB decoy resulted in a 43% or a 57% reduction in PGE2 production, whereas preincubation with the mutant decoy failed to attenuate PGE2 levels. In contrast, IL-1-induced IL-8 production by the same RSF was not significantly altered by pretreatment with either the NFκB decoy or the mutant decoy (Fig. 4B). To specifically modulate individual NFκB proteins, fibroblasts in serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium were incubated (18 h at 37°C) in the presence of Lipofectin vehicle or increasing concentrations (0.03-0.3 μM) of antisense to p65 (SB68), p50 (SB70), c-Rel (SB7721), or a scrambled oligonucleotide control (SB7222) as described under “Materials and Methods.” After the indicated time, cells were exposed to IL-1β (8 h, 37°C), and cell-free medium was analyzed for PGE2 levels as described under “Materials and Methods.” No toxicity compared with the Lipofectin control cultures was observed. Fig. 5A shows that prostaglandin levels of IL-1-stimulated RSF pretreated with 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 μM p65 antisense, SB68, were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by −23, −35, or −66%, respectively. In contrast, RSF pretreated with p50 antisense, c-Rel antisense, or the control oligonucleotide produced the same level of PGE2 in response to IL-1β as the unstimulated control cells. Fig. 5B shows that in the same cells pretreatment with p65 antisense and c-Rel antisense dose-dependently reduced stimulated IL-8 formation, whereas antisense to p50 and the control oligonucleotide failed to modulate IL-8 levels. RSF from some individual donors displayed sensitivity to nonspecific oligonucleotide treatment as was discovered using antisense to 85-kDa PLA2 in previous studies (6Roshak A. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Rheum. 1995; 23: 420-427Google Scholar), e.g. modest nonspecific reductions or potentiations. Nonetheless, all donors consistently responded to p65 antisense and subsequent studies examining the effect of p65 antisense on PGE2 formation were performed at 0.3 μM. Fig. 6A shows one of two representative experiments demonstrating that exposure to IL-1β caused the accumulation of COX II immunoreactive protein, whereas little or no COX II was evident in nonstimulated RSF as has been previously reported (6Roshak A. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Rheum. 1995; 23: 420-427Google Scholar, 7Angel J. Berenbaum F. Le Denmant C. Nav Alainen T. Masliah J. Fournier C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Hulkower K.I. Wertheimer S.J. Levin W. Coffey J.W. Anderson C.M. Chen T. Dewitt D.L. Crowel R.M. Hope W.C. Morgan D.W. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with p65 antisense significantly inhibited the IL-1β-induced increase in COX II immunoreactive protein levels. RSF of this particular donor displayed some sensitivity to oligonucleotide treatment as a marginal reduction in COX II protein expression occurred with the control oligonucleotide. This was mirrored in the PGE2 levels measured in the study (unstimulated PGE2, 0.4 ng/ml; IL-1β-stimulated PGE2, 10.1 ng/ml; SB68 + IL-1β PGE2, 1.1 ng/ml; SB71 + IL-1β PGE2, 8.9 ng/ml). Western analysis of the 85-kDa PLA2 revealed no change in protein levels with either p65 antisense or control oligonucleotide after 8 h (data not shown). However, evaluation of samples treated identically but exposed to IL-1β for 24 h rather than 8 h showed that 85-kDa PLA2 protein was reduced by ∼40% as assessed by scanning gel densitometry (pixel values: nontreated control, 30; IL-1β-stimulated control, 320; 0.3 μM SB68 198) (Fig. 6B). The effect of p65 antisense treatment on the mRNA levels for COX II and 85-kDa PLA2 in IL-1β stimulated RSF was analyzed by Northern blotting. Fig. 7A shows one representative of two studies where COX II mRNA was undetectable in unstimulated control cells and highly induced following 8 h of stimulation with IL-1β (Fig. 7A) as previously reported (8Hulkower K.I. Wertheimer S.J. Levin W. Coffey J.W. Anderson C.M. Chen T. Dewitt D.L. Crowel R.M. Hope W.C. Morgan D.W. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). p65 antisense treatment reduced this induction 13-fold, whereas the control oligonucleotide caused a minor reduction in this particular donor (∼2-fold). A significant level of 85-kDa PLA2 mRNA was detectable in the absence of IL-1β stimulation and increased 14-fold following an 8-h treatment with IL-1β (Fig. 7B). This induction was totally blocked by p65 antisense, whereas only a marginal decrease was observed with the control oligonucleotide, SB71. PGE2 levels measured in cell-free media reflect the Northern blot data (Fig. 7C). We were interested in assessing the possibility that NFκB participates in IL-1-induced PGE2 formation. NFκB proteins, c-Rel, p65, and p50 were identified in RSF and exposure to IL-1β clearly induced an early and time-dependent nuclear translocation of c-Rel and p65 but not p50. These results agree with the immunohistochemical localization of p65 in the nuclei of synovial cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients recently reported by Handel et al. (25Handel M.L. McMorrow L.B. Gravallese E.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 1762-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The possible role of other NFκB proteins such as RelB was not evaluated at this time, and therefore their involvement cannot be ruled out. However, expression of RelB appears to be restricted primarily to lymphoid tissues (26Carrasco D. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Development. 1993; 118: 1221-1231PubMed Google Scholar), and RelB homodimers or heterodimers with p65 and c-Rel have not been observed either in vitro or in vivo (27Bours V. Burd P.R. Brown K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ryseck R.P. Bull P. Takamiya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that this family member is involved in synovial fibroblast IL-1-driven prostanoid formation. It is well established that many inflammatory inducers such as IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharide stimulate PGE2 formation from a wide variety of cell types including monocyte/macrophage, fibroblast, and endothelial cells (29Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Further, these ligands are known to mediate the activation of NFκB (30Muller J.M. Zeigler-Heitbrock L. Baeuerll P.A. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 233-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). As such, a role for this transcription factor in the regulation of stimulated prostanoid formation could be envisioned. Little is known about the transcriptional control of either the COX II or the 85-kDa PLA2 gene expression. The cyclic AMP response element has been shown to be necessary for COX II induction in phorbol ester-differentiated human U937 cells (18Inoue H. Nanayama T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and the importance of both the cyclic AMP response element and NF-IL6 sites for COX II expression in lipopolysaccharide and phorbol ester-stimulated human vascular smooth muscle cells has been described (31Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In a murine osteoblast cell line, NFκB and NF-IL-6 were important in tumor necrosis factor-stimulated PGE2 production (32Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence for a role of NFκB in IL-1-stimulated PGE2 formation. This is in line with recent observations that glucocorticoids, which inhibit prostanoid formation act, in part, through regulation of NFκB activation (33Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Exposure to the NFκB decoy, mimicking the classical motif, but not the mutant decoy specifically reduced RSF PGE2 levels in response to IL-1. This indicated that dimers displaying high affinity for the classical κB motif were important in IL-1-induced PGE2 formation. Interestingly, IL-1-induced IL-8 production was not affected, which suggested involvement of a distinct NFκB, one that had little or no affinity for the classical motif. This was not unexpected because the IL-8 promoter contains an NFκB element, which represents an alternative κB motif. Because c-Rel-p65 binds to the alternative site, the data could suggest that this heterodimer is not involved in PGE2 regulation. To specifically delineate which NFκB proteins are involved in PGE2 biosynthesis, NFκB antisense oligonucleotides to p65, p50, and c-Rel were utilized. Antisense has been successfully used to demonstrate specific NFκB regulation of proinflammatory mediators and models of cell adhesion such as CD11b expression in differentiated HL-60 leukemia cells (34Sokoloski J.A. Sartorelli A.C. Rosen C.A. Narayanan R. Blood. 1993; 82: 625-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and murine embryonic stem cell adhesion (35Narayanan R. Higgins K.A. Perez J.R. Coleman T.A. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 3802-3810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kunsch and Rosen successfully demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides to p65 but not p50 reduced phorbol myristate acetate-induced Jurkat T lymphocytes IL-8 production (14Kunsch C. Rosen C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6137-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In RSF, utilization of antisense demonstrated the importance of p65 but not p50 or c-Rel in IL-1β induced PGE2 formation. The lack of effect of p50 antisense in this system could be due to p50 protein stability over the time course of our studies, or it is possible that an alternative heterodimer can compensate for the loss of p50. This particular p50 antisense oligonucleotide was effective in inhibiting cell to substratum adhesion in differentiated embryonic stem cells but not in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells where p65 antisense was shown to be effective (35Narayanan R. Higgins K.A. Perez J.R. Coleman T.A. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 3802-3810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of effect of p50 antisense in our system therefore indicates that p50 is not a dimeric partner in the induction of PGE2. c-Rel antisense also had no effect on stimulated PGE2 formation. Alternatively, IL-1-stimulated IL-8 production was reduced by antisense to both p65 and c-Rel consistent with the preferential binding of a c-Rel-p65 heterodimer to the IL-8 κB-like motif and the lack of affinity of the classical κB motif for c-Rel containing dimers. This strongly suggests that c-Rel is not the dimeric partner participating with p65 in the regulation of COX II and 85-kDa PLA2 gene expression. The reduced capability of p65 antisense-treated RSF to produce PGE2 correlated with a reduction in both COX II and 85-kDa PLA2 mRNA levels. At 8 h of IL-1 exposure, a time point where COX II protein is clearly present (6Roshak A. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Rheum. 1995; 23: 420-427Google Scholar, 7Angel J. Berenbaum F. Le Denmant C.

Dewitt D.L. Crowel R.M. Hope W.C. Morgan D.W. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), p65 antisense treatment resulted in total depletion of COX II protein. The 85-kDa PLA2 protein depletion required a longer time possibly due to a long protein half-life, as suggested by Hulkower et al. (8Hulkower K.I. Wertheimer S.J. Levin W. Coffey J.W. Anderson C.M. Chen T. Dewitt D.L. Crowel R.M. Hope W.C. Morgan D.W. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), or the involvement of more complex post-transcriptional regulatory events (36Miyashita A. Crystal R.G. Hay J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Tay A. Maxwell P. Li Z. Goldberg H. Skorecki K. Biochem J. 1994; 304: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because of the temporal discrepancy in protein depletion, it would appear that the reduction in PGE2 observed in the first 8 h was primarily due to the lack of COX II. Nonetheless, these data support NFκB participation in the regulation of both COX II and 85-kDa PLA2 expression. Indeed, the recent co-localization of both human genes to the same region of chromosone 1 (1q25) (38Kosaka T. Miyata A. Ihara H. Hara S. Sugimoto T. Takeda O. Takahashi E. Tanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 39Tay A. Simon J.S. Squire J. Hamel K. Jacob H.J. Skorecki K. Genomics. 1995; 26: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) suggests the intriguing possibility for coordinate gene regulation. To our knowledge, these data provide the first direct evidence for a role of the NFκB protein, p65, in regulation of COX II and 85-kDa PLA2 gene expression. Because both are required for IL-1-induced PGE2 formation in RSF, it appears that NFκB activation plays a regulatory role in PGE2 biosynthesis. Finally, we show that PGE2 formation requires NFκB dimers that appear to be different from those that participate in IL-1-driven IL-8 expression.

https://openalex.org/W1970328728,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades include MAPK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), MAPK kinase (MKK or MEK), and MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK or MEKK). MAPKK kinase/MEKK phosphorylates and activates its downstream protein kinase, MAPK kinase/MEK, which in turn activates MAPK. We report herein the isolation of a cDNA encoding a novel protein kinase designated MAPKKK5 from a human macrophage library. The nucleotide sequence predicts that MAPKKK5 encodes an open reading frame of 1374 amino acids with all 11 kinase subdomains. The putative catalytic domain of MAPKKK5 shows significant sequence homology to the kinase domains of the MAPKKK/MEKK level protein kinases from mouse MEKK2 and -3, Drosophila melanogaster PK92B, Saccharomyces cerevisiae STE11, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe BYR2. Northern blot analysis showed that MAPKKK5 transcript is abundantly expressed in human heart and pancreas. When transiently expressed in COS and 293 cells, MAPKKK5 markedly activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase, but not MAPK/ERK. Furthermore, MAPKKK5 that was immunoprecipitated from transfected 293 cells was able to phosphorylate and activate MKK4 in vitro, suggesting that MAPKKK5 may be an upstream activator of MKK4 in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2007848866,"DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) have distinct roles as unlinking enzymes during DNA replication despite 40% sequence identity between them. DNA gyrase unlinks replicating DNA by introducing negative supercoils while Topo IV decatenates the two daughter molecules. For this study, we measured the rates of unlinking of various topoisomers of DNA by DNA gyrase and Topo IV. Each enzyme has marked preferences for certain strand-passage reactions. DNA gyrase is a relatively poor decatenase, catalyzing strand-passage events that result in supercoiling at rates several orders of magnitude faster than those causing decatenation. Topo IV, in contrast, decatenates linked circles 10-40 times more quickly than it removes the intramolecular crossings from supercoiled DNA. Supercoiled catenanes are unlinked at an even more increased rate by Topo IV. Thus, the supercoils augment decatenation rather than compete with catenane crossings for their removal. Knot crossings and the crossings of multiply interlinked catenanes are also preferentially removed by Topo IV. This ability of Topo IV to selectively unlink catenated molecules mirrors its key role in decatenation of replicating chromosomes in vivo."

The trafficking of most lysosomal hydrolases in higher eucaryotes is mediated by a mannose 6-phosphate-dependent pathway. Asparagine-linked oligosaccharides on newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases are sequentially modified by two enzymes to generate a mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker. The initial and determining step in the biosynthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker is catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal-enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase). 1The abbreviations used are: GlcNAc-phosphotransferaseUDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal-enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidPTHphenylthiohydantoin.

GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity is deficient in human mucolipidosis II (I-cell disease, McKusick 252500) and mucolipidosis III (pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy, McKusick 252600), and this deficiency is believed to be the primary genetic deficit in these disorders (8Reitman M.L.

Although this enzyme exhibits some properties similar to the mammalian GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, its functional role is unknown since it has been determined that Acanthamoeba lacks the second enzyme, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester α-N-acetylglucosaminidase, required for the complete mannose 6phosphate-dependent lysosomal targeting system found in higher eucaryotes (13Ketcham C.M.

[β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc was synthesized using 250 nmol of glucosamine and 2.5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP essentially as described (9Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc was purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on an Ultrasphere ODS column (0.5 × 30 cm) with a linear gradient from 40 mM KH2PO4, pH 6.0, 5 mM tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate to 100% acetonitrile at 1 ml/min (17Ropp P.A. Cheng P.-W. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Alternatively, [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a Microsorb MV column (0.25 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 5 mM KH2PO4, pH 4.0, and developed at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient from 5 mM KH2PO4, pH 4.0, to 1.5 M KH2PO4, pH 3.0, as described (18Brown E.G. Newton R.P. Shaw N.M. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 123: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Purified [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc had a specific activity of 10 mCi/μmol and was homogeneous in both chromatography systems. One unit of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity is defined as 1 pmol of GlcNAc phosphate transferred to α-methylmannoside/h in a reaction containing 150 μM UDP-GlcNAc and 100 mM α-methylmannoside at 37°C (9Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Lactating bovine mammary glands (∼10 kg) were collected at slaughter, sliced into 10-cm thick slices, and immediately packed in an ice/water slurry. Within 30 min of collection, the tissue was cut into 2-cm cubes and freed of connective tissue and vascular structures. The cubed gland was homogenized for 2 min in 1-kg aliquots with 1 liter of buffer A at 4°C (Waring commercial blender, high setting). The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected by decantation, avoiding the floating lipid pad. The post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 9,500 × g for 15 min. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 47,900 × g for 45 min, washed by suspension and brief homogenization in 1700 ml of buffer B, and subsequently collected by centrifugation at 47,900 × g for 4 h. The membrane pellets were extracted by homogenization in 1100 ml of buffer C and collected by centrifugation at 47,900 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the membrane fragments in the pooled salt extracts were pooled with a second salt extraction and pelleted by centrifugation at 47,900 × g for 4 h. The supernatant was discarded, and GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was solubilized from the membrane pellets by suspension in buffer D, dispersion by brief homogenization (Polytron, Buchler Instruments; standard probe), and stirring for 1 h at 4°C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 47,900 × g for 4 h, yielding a solubilized membrane fraction. The solubilized membrane fraction was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (5.0 × 28 cm) equilibrated with buffer E at 5 ml/min. After washing with ∼1 liter of buffer E containing 0.075 M NaCl, the column was developed with a 2.5-liter linear gradient from 0.075 to 0.275 M NaCl in buffer E. Fractions of 20 ml were collected, and those containing specific activities >20,000 units/mg were pooled. The pooled fractions from the DEAE-Sepharose FF column were applied to a reactive green 19-agarose column (2.6 × 35 cm) equilibrated with buffer E at 5 ml/min. The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer E and developed with a 200-ml linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in buffer E. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was then step-eluted with buffer E containing 1 M NaCl. Fractions of 10 ml were collected, and those with specific activities >100,000 units/mg were pooled. The protein fractions containing GlcNAc-phosphotransferase from the reactive green 19-agarose column were pooled and diluted 10-fold with buffer E and applied to a POROS 50 HQ column (1.6 × 20 cm) equilibrated with buffer E at 10 ml/min. The column was washed with 80 ml of buffer E and eluted with buffer E containing 0.5 M NaCl. Fractions of 10 ml were collected, and the two fractions containing the highest protein concentration were pooled. The pool from the POROS 50 HQ column was diluted 5-fold with buffer E and applied to a Mono Q column (0.5 × 5.0 cm) equilibrated with buffer E at 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 1 column volume of buffer E and step-eluted with buffer E containing 0.5 M NaCl. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and the four fractions containing the highest enzyme activity were pooled. The concentrated Mono Q sample was applied to two Superose 6 columns (1.6 × 50 cm) connected in series and equilibrated with buffer E containing 0.15 M NaCl at 0.25 ml/min. Fractions of 1.0 ml were collected and assayed for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity and protein. Polyclonal antisera that immunocapture GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity were raised in BALB/c mice inoculated with 75 μg of partially purified GlcNAc-phosphotransferase from Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography (specific activity ∼ 106 units/mg). Monoclonal antibodies were prepared by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse to SP2/0 mouse myeloma cells according to standard procedures (19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Fusions were plated in five 96-well plates and grown in Iscove's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/ml recombinant human interleukin-6. Hybridomas were screened for the production of murine IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To identify antibodies of interest, aliquots (100 μl) of supernatants from IgG-producing hybridomas were combined in groups of five and screened for their ability to capture GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (800 units) in a final volume of 200 μl of buffer F was incubated with pooled hybridoma supernatant (500 μl) for 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose (15 μl of a 1:1 slurry of beads in buffer I coated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG) was added, and incubation was continued for 1 h with mixing. The beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of buffer I, and the pellets were assayed for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity. Hybridomas secreting GlcNAc-phosphotransferase-specific monoclonal antibodies were subcloned twice, and antibody was produced in ascites culture. Monoclonal antibodies were purified on protein G-Sepharose and isotyped by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit (Sigma) standardized with a mouse immunoglobulin standard panel. Ascites (1 ml) containing monoclonal antibodies PT18, PT19, PT20, and PT21 or the irrelevant isotype control (BP95) were dialyzed against 0.6 M citrate, 0.1 M MOPS, pH 7.4, overnight and coupled to 3M-Emphaze resin overnight at 4°C. The remaining reactive sites were blocked by incubation with 3 M ethanolamine HCl, pH 9.0, for 4 h. The immobilized monoclonal antibodies were incubated with partially purified GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (200,000 units) and washed at neutral pH to remove unbound GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. Parallel samples were also washed with buffer at pH 10. Bound GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was then quantitated by assay of aliquots of the resin for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity. All steps were performed at 4°C, except chromatography was performed at room temperature. The post-nuclear supernatant was prepared as described for Method I, except that all solutions were made 1 mM in phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine HCl. The post-nuclear supernatant was made 20 mM in MnCl2 and stirred at 4°C for 30 min. Membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The membrane pellets were combined, and Lubrol and deoxycholate were added to final concentrations of 4 and 0.5%, respectively. After stirring for 30 min, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 47,900 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was decanted and combined with 10 ml of monoclonal antibody PT18-3M-Emphaze in a 1.5-liter polyethylene terephthalate bottle. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine were added to 1 mM each, and the PT18-3M-Emphaze suspension was then continuously rotated at 44 rpm on a rotary tumbler for 16 h at 4°C. The PT18-3M-Emphaze was then packed in a 1.6 × 5-cm column and washed with ∼50 ml of buffer G containing 1.0 M NaCl at 5 ml/min until the absorbance at 280 nm was <0.05. The column was then equilibrated with buffer G, and GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was eluted with buffer H at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and assayed for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity and protein. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase from PT18-3M-Emphaze (10 μg) in buffer H adjusted to pH 8.0 with 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, was incubated with 0.8 mCi of Na125I for 3 min in a 12 × 75-mm glass tube previously coated with 10 μg of IODO-GEN in dichloromethane (20Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). 125I-Labeled GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 blocked with 500 mg of bovine serum albumin and then equilibrated with buffer F containing 0.15 M NaCl. The specific activity of the 125I-labeled GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was 12 μCi/μg. Porcine uteroferrin was radioiodinated with the same procedure to a specific activity of 2 μCi/μg. 125I-Labeled GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (0.5 μCi) and 125I-labeled porcine uteroferrin (0.5 μCi) in 50 μl of buffer F were incubated with 100 μl of hybridoma supernatant for 16 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose with bound rabbit anti-mouse IgG (20 μl of a 50% slurry in buffer J) was added, and the incubation was continued for 2 h. The Sepharose was then collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of buffer J. Bound proteins were released by incubation with 6% SDS, 10%β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 100°C, and the eluted proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris/Tricine buffer. Following electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to Kodak MS film at −70°C for 12 h with an intensifying screen. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (20 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris/glycine buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with and without disulfide bond reduction. The gel was electroblotted onto a ProBlott membrane (22Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was stained for 1 min with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol and briefly destained in 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol. The 340,000-, 166,000-, 102,000-, and 56,000-Da protein bands were excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems Model 492 protein sequencer. The broad 51,000-56,000-Da band in the reduced sample was excised en block and treated similarly. Lactating bovine mammary glands were chosen as a tissue source for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase purification because preliminary experiments indicated relatively high GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity, and the tissue was available in large quantities. To investigate whether mammary gland GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was membrane-associated, the post-nuclear supernatant fraction of mammary gland homogenates was centrifuged at 106,000 × g for 30 min. Greater than 95% of the enzyme activity was pelleted under these conditions. Detergent (4% Lubrol), but not 1 M NaCl, was able to release GlcNAc-phosphotransferase from the membrane into the 106,000 × g supernatant, indicating that the enzyme is membrane-associated, similar to the enzyme activities in rat liver (7Dahms N.M.

Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The 30,000-fold partial purification of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase by Method I is summarized in Table I. Crude membranes were precipitated from homogenates of mammary glands by high speed centrifugation. The preparation of a high speed crude membrane pellet from lactating bovine mammary gland was based on a procedure developed by Vijay and Fram (23Vijay I.K. Fram S.R. J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 7: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) for the purification of UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:dolichyl-phosphate N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (24Shailubhai K. Dong-Yu B. Saxena E.S. Vijay I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15964-15972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were solubilized in Lubrol and deoxycholate and chromatographed on DEAE-Sepharose FF. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase bound to the column and was eluted as a symmetric peak near the midpoint of a gradient in sodium chloride (Fig. 1A). Overall, the enzyme eluted from the DEAE column was purified 1,300-fold with a yield of 3.6%. Pooled fractions from the DEAE column were directly applied to a column of reactive green 19-agarose. The enzyme bound tightly to the column, which was washed with a salt gradient and eluted with 1.0 M NaCl (Fig. 1B). Washing the reactive green 19-agarose with a NaCl gradient resulted in consistently higher specific activity than washing with a fixed concentration of NaCl. The enzyme eluted from the reactive green 19-agarose column was purified 6,500-fold over the starting material in 2.5% yield.Table IMethod I: purification of bovine mammary gland phosphotransferaseStepVolumeProtein concTotal proteinPhosphotransferaseActivitySpecific activityTotal activityYieldPurificationmlmg/mlmgunits/mlunits/mgunits%-foldHomogenate20,3742024,040,0005,00024101,870,0001001.0Cleared homogenate11,930881,050,0005,6456467,344,000662.6Post-nuclear supernatant11,24074832,0005,9147966,473,000653.2Solubilized membrane49524.712,25529,8981,21014,800,0001448.0DEAE-Sepharose FF3400.3511910,90631,1603,708,0003.61,298Reactive green 19900.2216.8829,109155,2002,619,8002.56,466POROS 50 HQ101.1211.2220,000196,0002,200,0002.28,184Superose 660.130.894,338720,000566,0320.630,000 Open table in a new tab The reactive green 19 pool was concentrated to 2 ml by ion-exchange chromatography on POROS 50 HQ and Mono Q. The concentrated GlcNAc-phosphotransferase from the Mono Q column was then chromatographed on Superose 6. The enzyme was included in the column and eluted as a symmetric peak at a position consistent with a molecular mass of ∼570,000 Da (Fig. 1C). Following chromatography on Superose 6, the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase had been purified 30,000-fold to a specific activity of 720,000 units/mg in 0.6% yield. Peak fractions contained GlcNAc-phosphotransferase at specific activities >106 units/mg. SDS-PAGE and silver staining showed that multiple polypeptides were present in the fractions containing GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity. Protein bands whose intensity correlated with GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity were not apparent (data not shown). Attempts to utilize affinity chromatography steps for further purification were unsuccessful. As an alternative approach, the partially purified enzyme was used to generate monoclonal antibodies for immunoaffinity purification of the enzyme. Mice were immunized with partially purified GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, and spleens were removed and fused with myeloma cells according to standard techniques. Hybridomas secreting antibodies against GlcNAc-phosphotransferase were identified with a two-step screening procedure. First, hybridomas secreting mouse IgG were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described under “Methods.” Monoclonal antibodies specific for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase were then identified by their ability to immunoprecipitate GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity. Four GlcNAc-phosphotransferase-specific monoclonal antibodies (all of subclass IgG2), designated PT18, PT19, PT20, and PT21, were produced. The binding characteristics of these monoclonal antibodies were evaluated by incubation of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (200,000 units) with 1 ml of various monoclonal antibodies coupled to 3M-Emphaze resin. Following a neutral pH wash to remove unbound GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, aliquots of the loaded resin were subjected to experimental elution conditions. As shown in Fig. 2, the immobilized monoclonal antibodies bound 40-90% of the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, while the control monoclonal antibody (BP95) (directed against bovine C4b-binding protein) bound <5%. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was eluted from monoclonal antibodies PT18, PT19, and PT20, but not PT21, with buffer at pH 10. The reduction in GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity results from elution, not denaturation, since the enzyme is stable to pH 11 (data not shown). Chromatography of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase from the Superose 6 column on immobilized monoclonal antibody PT18 resulted in an additional 10-20-fold purification with an overall yield of ∼0.1% (data not shown). Using the immunoaffinity column as the final purification step was judged to be successful but suboptimal since most of the enzyme had been lost during preceding steps. With the availability of immunoaffinity chromatography steps, the purification scheme was redesigned to simplify the isolation and to improve the yield. This resulted in the development of purification Method II. The 488,000-fold purification of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase to apparent homogeneity by Method II is summarized in Table II.Table IIMethod II: purification of bovine mammary gland phosphotransferaseStepVolumeProtein concentrationTotal proteinPhosphotransferaseActivitySpecific activityTotal activityYieldPurificationmlmg/mlmgunits/mlunits/mgunits%-foldCleared homogenate6,4002001,280,0006,4002552,000,0001001.0Post-nuclear supernatant6,020105632,0006,8008241,000,000793.3Solubilized membrane640378242,00030,8438119,700,000383.2PT18-3M-Emphaze eluate80.161.241,900,00012,200,00015,200,00029488,000 Open table in a new tab Membrane proteins were precipitated from the post-nuclear supernatant with MnCl2 (25Bendiak B.

By transfer of domains from the G protein-coupled OT receptor into the related V2 vasopressin receptor, chimeric “gain in function” V2/OT receptors were produced that were able to bind either OT receptor agonists or a competitive peptide antagonist with high affinity.

These transmembrane receptor regions could be excluded from participating in OT binding. For agonist binding and selectivity the first three extracellular receptor domains were most important. The interaction of the N-terminal domain and of the first extracellular loop of the OT receptor with the linear C-terminal tripeptidic part of oxytocin was demonstrated. Furthermore, the second extracellular loop of the OT receptor could be identified to interact with the cyclic hormone part.

Our results provide evidence for the existence of separate domains and different conformations of a peptide hormone receptor involved in binding and selectivity for agonists and peptide antagonists. Oxytocin belongs to the family of neurohypophyseal nonapeptide hormones, which are characterized by a cyclic hexapeptidic part with a disulfide bridge between Cys1 and Cys6 and a C-terminal linear tripeptidic extension (Fig. 1). Its major physiological role is to induce contraction of uterine smooth muscle and mammary myoepithelium. As pregnancy nears term, uterine smooth muscle exhibits enhanced sensitivity to oxytocin (1Fuchs A.R. Fuchs F. Husslein P. Soloff M.S. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1984; 150: 734-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Oxytocin is widely used to induce labor, and conversely, oxytocin antagonists are being evaluated for the treatment of preterm labor (2Manning M. Cheng L.L. Klis W.A. Stoev S. Przybylski J.

These oxytocinergic effects are mediated by a specific cell surface receptor, the OT receptor which is also found in other organs such as brain (5Carter C.S. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1992; 16: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and ovary (6Fuchs A.R. Behrens O. Helmer H. Vangsted A. Ivanisevic M. Grifo J. Barros C. Fields M. Am. J. Obstet.

Cloning of the oxytocin receptor from five mammalian species has shown that it belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor family with seven transmembrane helices (7Bathgate R. Rust W. Balvers M.

Photoaffinity labeling studies with a photoreactive OT antagonist identified the oxytocin receptor as a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight between 68,000 and 80,000 (12Kojro E. Hackenberg M. Zsigo J. Fahrenholz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21416-21421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Functional domains, especially the topography of the ligand-binding site, are presently unknown. oxytocin [arginine8] vasopressin [arginine8]vasotocin guanyl nucleotide binding protein porcine V2 receptor cDNA polymerase chain reaction oxypressin or [phenyl3]oxytocin [1-(β-mercapto-β, β-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid), 2-(O-methyl)tyrosine, 4-threonine, 8-ornithine, 9-tyrosylamide]vasotocin; V2 receptor, V2 vasopressin receptor. The aim of our investigations was to determine domains of the OT receptor that are involved in high-affinity binding of both agonists and antagonists. Since all known OT receptors share almost identical primary structure and bind OT with high affinity, it can be assumed that alterations of this naturally optimized binding site will result in a loss of high-affinity oxytocin binding. This effect can be caused either by disturbances of specific receptor-ligand interactions but also by changes in the overall receptor conformation. Therefore, we decided to produce “gain in function” receptors, to identify OT receptor domains that contribute to high-affinity OT and oxytocin antagonist binding. As starting protein for the identification of oxytocin binding domains, we used the related V2 vasopressin receptor. This receptor mediates the antidiuretic action of [8-arginine]vasopressin in kidney. It shows 40% overall sequence identity to the oxytocin receptor with the highest sequence similarity in the transmembrane regions and the extracellular loops. Although vasopressin and oxytocin differ only at position 3 of the cyclic peptide part and position 8 of the C-terminal tripeptide amide, the V2 vasopressin receptor discriminates strongly between the ligands AVP and OT; arginine vasopressin is bound with roughly 400-fold higher affinity than OT and activates the adenylyl cyclase second messenger system by coupling to Gαs. In contrast, the OT receptor binds OT and AVP with almost similar affinities and leads to activation of the phospholipase C second messenger system via coupling to Gαq/11 (13Ku C.-Y. Qian A. Wen Y. Anwer K. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1509-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to oxytocin, AVP acts only as a partial agonist on the OT receptor. A 100-fold higher concentration of AVP was needed to induce the same membrane current at Xenopus oocytes expressing the OT receptor (14Kimura T. Makino Y. Saji F. Takemura M. Inoue T. Kikuchi T. Kubota Y. Azuma C. Nobunaga T. Tokugawa Y. Tanizawa O. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 131: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Introduction of oxytocin receptor domains into the V2 vasopressin receptor should allow the transfer of a high-affinity oxytocin binding site and the identification of domains interacting with the cyclic and the linear C-terminal tripeptidic part of oxytocin. If the intracellular receptor domains are not changed, such chimeric receptors would in principle couple to Gαs and respond to oxytocin with high efficiency activation of the adenylyl cyclase system. Furthermore, this approach could allow the localization of the binding site for antagonists with high specificity for the oxytocin receptor. By a directed exchange of the four extracellular receptor domains in the V2 vasopressin receptor for the corresponding sequences of the OT receptor, we demonstrate that the first three extracellular domains of the oxytocin receptor are essential for high-affinity binding of oxytocin and for selectivity toward agonists. The chimeric V2/OT receptors were able to activate the adenylyl cyclase in response to oxytocin in a dose-dependent manner. Whereas for the transfer of a high-affinity oxytocin agonist binding site into the V2 receptor the first three extracellular oxytocin receptor domains were essential; just seven amino acids of the upper part of transmembrane helix seven of the oxytocin receptor were sufficient to introduce a high-affinity binding site for an oxytocin peptide antagonist into the V2 receptor. Our results demonstrate the synergistic contribution of extracellular domains on agonist binding and ligand specificity in a peptide receptor and the different localization of agonist and antagonist binding sites. Also, the necessity of considering the outer membrane regions for further three-dimensional modeling of G protein-coupled receptors became clear. The aim of chimeric receptor construction was to obtain functionally active proteins with an increased affinity for oxytocin and to be able to activate the V2 receptor-coupled second messenger system, adenylyl cyclase. Therefore, we decided to exchange mainly the extracellular receptor domains. Alterations of a native optimized structure can always cause nonfunctional receptors. Therefore, another detection method of the proteins is advantageous. For that purpose, all chimeric, mutant, and the V2 wild-type receptors were fused with the c-myc epitope allowing their immunological detection. All chimeric genes were transiently expressed in COS.M6 cells. Then ligand binding and second messenger activation studies were performed at cell membrane preparations. The mutagenesis of the porcine V2 receptor cDNA (8Gorbulev V. Büchner H. Akhundova A. Fahrenholz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) has been described elsewhere (15Postina R. Fahrenholz F. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Eight sites for the restriction endonucleases EcoRV, MluI, Eco47III, MunI, BsrGI, HindIII, BglII, and BamHI were inserted into the V2 cDNA without altering the amino acid sequence of the translated receptor. The in vitro synthesis of the DNA strands was performed in 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 37.5 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 0.5 mM dNTPs (each) at 37°C for 2 h in the presence of 15 units of T4 DNA polymerase (Promega) and 5 units of T4 DNA ligase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). To distinguish between the mutated gene containing new restriction sites and the original LVP cDNA, it was denoted as “LVPs gene.” The location of the new sites is indicated in Fig. 2. The BglII and the BamHI sites are located in the 3′-nontranslated region of the LVPs gene and are therefore not included in Fig. 2. Both sites were needed for further cloning strategies. To introduce the point mutation Y102F, the LVPs gene was inserted between the EcoRI and the BamHI site of pALTER-1 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) resulting in pALTER-1-LVPs, and site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described above. Insertion of the LVPs gene between the EcoRI and the BglII site of the expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) resulted in the vector pSG-LVPs used for expression in COS cells. The c-myc epitope-tagged receptor was constructed by using the plasmid pSGmyc; its construction is described in detail elsewhere (16Cao Y.-J. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 673-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this plasmid a unique BamHI site at the 3′-end of the c-myc coding sequence was first cleaved with BamHI, and then T4 DNA polymerase was used to fill in the overhangs and after this step it was digested with BglII. This resulted in a linearized expression vector with one blunt end and one cohesive end, complementary to BglII. Ligation with EcoRV- and BglII-cleaved LVPs gene or chimeric genes resulted in an in-frame fusion to the c-myc coding sequence. During this cloning step the EcoRV and the BamHI sites were not restored. The vector with the LVPs gene (pSGmyc-LVPs) was directly used for the construction of some chimeric genes (see below) or for transient expression. Construction of Chimeric V2/OT Receptors All coding sequences of the porcine oxytocin receptor cDNA (8Gorbulev V. Büchner H. Akhundova A. Fahrenholz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) intended for an exchange were amplified by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). The oligonucleotides were designed to create the same sites for restriction endonucleases at each end of the PCR product as needed for the exchange of the corresponding domain within the LVPs gene (Fig. 2). Afterward, the corresponding segments present in the LVPs gene were exchanged for the isolated PCR-amplified coding sequences of the OT receptor gene. The vector pSGmyc-LVPs (see above) could be directly used for the separate exchange of domains E2, E4, E4+, and TM12, since all needed cloning sites were unique. Due to the lack of an EcoRV site in pSGmyc-LVPs, it could not be used directly for the construction of the chimeric E1 receptor. Therefore, it was first necessary to exchange the sequence coding for the N terminus of the V2 receptor within the pSG-LVPs vector (see above) for the PCR product coding for E1 of the OT receptor. Afterward, the resulting plasmid was cleaved with EcoRV and BglII and then the isolated chimeric E1 receptor gene was fused to the coding sequence of the c-myc epitope as described above. Because of the presence of an additional MunI site in the vector core of pSGmyc-LVPs, it could not be directly used for the exchange of E3. Therefore, pALTER-1-LVPs (see above) was used for the exchange of the E3 coding sequence. Afterward, the chimeric E3 receptor gene was fused to the c-myc coding region as described for E1. The expression vectors bearing chimeric genes with multiple exchanged coding regions were constructed by combining the corresponding DNA sequences using unique restriction sites. The correct construction of all chimeras was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using the dideoxynucleotide chain-terminating method and the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp./Amersham, Braunschweig). COS.M6 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method, and membrane preparations were performed as described elsewhere (17Ufer E. Postina R. Gorbulev V. Fahrenholz F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, cell membranes were washed and homogenized in 15 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4. The protein content of the membranes was determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215491) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The prepared membranes were used for binding and adenylyl cyclase activation assays. In saturation and displacement assays [3H]AVP (Amersham, UK) was used as labeled ligand. The binding buffer composition for both experiments was 50 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and the incubation time was 30 min at 30°C. Bound and free radioactivity were separated by filtration over Whatman GF/F filters presoaked in filtration buffer (15 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, at 4°C, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.02% bovine serum albumin) by using a Brandel harvester. In saturation experiments 5-30 μg of membrane protein and [3H]AVP in concentrations from 0.25 to 50 nM were used. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 400-fold excess of unlabeled AVP. In competition experiments 4-30 μg of membrane protein were used. The amount of membrane protein in the assay was chosen to bind maximally 10% of the [3H]AVP in the test. Competition binding of 10 nM [3H]AVP with unlabeled hormones in a concentration range from 0.1 nM to 10 μM was then performed with AVP, AVT, OT (all from Bachem, Switzerland), OP (kindly provided by Dr. M. Manning), and OTA (synthesized by Dr. U. Klein). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 4 μM unlabeled AVP. Competition with unlabeled AVP resulted in Ki values similar to the Kd values obtained from the saturation experiments (Ki = 2.9 nM and Kd = 2.7 nM for E3, respectively). All binding data were analyzed with nonlinear fitting programs (Radlig 4.0, Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Presentation of the data was performed with the Sigma plot program (Jandel Scientific). The synthesis of the radioiodinated photoreactive oxytocin antagonist was performed by introducing a photoreactive 4-azidophenylamidino group at Orn8 of OTA and by radioiodination at Tyr9 (12Kojro E. Hackenberg M. Zsigo J. Fahrenholz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21416-21421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling was performed as described elsewhere (12Kojro E. Hackenberg M. Zsigo J. Fahrenholz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21416-21421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of membrane protein from transfected COS.M6 cells containing between 1.3 and 2.0 pmol/mg chimeric receptors were incubated with 0.25 nM 125I-labeled photoreactive antagonist in 200 μl of binding buffer (50 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mM MnCl2) for 30 min at 30°C. Unbound ligand was separated from the membranes by a 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g. After irradiation the membrane proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (11%) and autoradiography. The hormone-induced adenylyl cyclase activation was performed in a final volume of 100 μl composed of 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 1 μM GTP, 250 μM 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxy-benzyl)imidazolidin-2-one as phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 20 mM creatine phosphate, 150 units/ml creatine phosphokinase containing 30 μg of cell membrane protein, and the stimulating hormones AVP or OT in concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 1 μM. The cAMP production was started by adding membranes; the reaction mixture was then incubated for 20 min at 37°C, and afterward the reaction was stopped by boiling for 4 min, and then membrane debris was pelleted. The supernatant was diluted (1:5) with 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and cAMP was determined using the Amersham kit, TRK 432. The separation of bound and free radioactivity was achieved by filtration over Whatman GF/C filters presoaked in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3% polyethyleneimine; the filtration buffer was ice-cold 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Ligand Selectivity of the OT Receptor Versus Selectivity of the V2 Vasopressin Receptor The ligand selectivity of the cloned oxytocin receptor was compared with that of the V2 receptor. Discrimination between the two hormones oxytocin and arginine vasopressin was examined; furthermore, the two related ligands [8-arginine]vasotocin and oxypressin were included. They differ only in one position (either position 3 or 8) from the native hormones (Fig. 1), with AVT being identical to OT in its cyclic hexapeptide part and to oxypressin ([Phe3]oxytocin) in its C-terminal tripeptidic extension. The OT receptor binds the hormones OT and AVT with identically high affinity (Ki = 0.6 nM), whereas OP (Ki = 4.8 nM) and AVP (Ki = 7 nM) have an affinity which is about 10 times lower (Table I). The oxytocin receptor therefore has a weak ligand selectivity profile: hormones with the same cyclic part and either Arg8 or Leu8 and are bound with the same affinity, whereby Ile3 in the cyclic hormone part contributes more to affinity than Phe3. This indicates that the hormone cyclus is more important in conferring binding selectivity for the oxytocin receptor than the linear tripeptidic part of the hormones.Table I.Ligand binding selectivity of wild-type, chimeric, and mutated receptorsThe inhibition constants (Ki) were obtained by a nonlinear least square regression using the program Radlig 4.0 (Biosoft; Cambridge, UK). The curve-fitting process was based on competition binding of [3H]AVP with unlabeled hormones in a concentration range from 0.1 nM to 10 μM. All values are the means ± S.E. of three different experiments performed in duplicate; ND, not determined.

Open table in a new tab The V2 receptor has a completely different ligand selectivity. An influence of both amino acids positions 3 and 8 is found on ligand binding affinity; AVT is bound with a 10-fold lower affinity than AVP, whereas the binding of OP is reduced by a factor of 33. This demonstrates that the ligand selectivity is regulated by both the cyclic and the linear hormone part with a stronger influence of the linear C-terminal tripeptidic extension. The two substitutions in positions 3 and 8 are found in oxytocin and result in a roughly 400-fold reduction in affinity to the V2 receptor as compared with its natural hormone vasopressin. The specific oxytocin antagonist d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2,Thr4,Orn8,Tyr9]vasotocin (19Elands J. Barberis C. Jard S. Tribollet E. Dreifuss J.-J. Bankowski K. Manning M. Sawyer W.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 147: 197-207Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar) with a sterically demanding residue in position 1 (Fig. 1) binds with high affinity to the OT receptor expressed in COS cells (Ki = 7 nM), whereas its affinity for the V2 receptor is reduced by 2 orders of magnitude. The exchange of the N terminus of the V2 receptor for the first extracellular domain of the OT receptor resulted in the chimeric E1 receptor (Fig. 2). As compared with the V2 receptor, E1 retained almost the same affinities for AVP (Ki = 1.1 nM) and AVT (Ki = 9.3 nM). Both hormones, AVP and AVT, have a different cyclic part, but they are identical in their linear tripeptidic extension (Fig. 1). This is also the case for OP and OT, but their linear part is more hydrophobic. The exchange of the receptor N terminus led to a significant increase in OP and OT binding. As compared with the V2 receptor, the affinity for OP is increased 4-fold (Ki (OP) = 6.2 nM) and 6-fold for OT (Ki (OT) = 50 nM). This indicates that the N terminus of the OT receptor takes part in hormone binding and interacts with the hydrophobic leucyl residue in position 8 of the ligands. To exclude any influence of the additional c-myc epitope tag at the N terminus on ligand binding affinity and selectivity, the tagged and the wild-type V2 receptor were expressed in COS cells. Saturation experiments with [3H]AVP resulted in nearly identical dissociation constants (Kd = 0.9 ± 0.1 nM for the wild-type V2 receptor, Kd = 0.8 ± 0.2 nM for the c-myc tagged V2 receptor). Furthermore, the ligand selectivity of the tagged and wild-type receptor for the ligands AVT, OT, and lysine vasopressin was identical. Since all expressed receptors were functionally active, there was no need to demonstrate their expression immunologically by using the c-myc epitope. Advantage of Relative Affinities (Krel) for Comparison of Different Chimeric Receptors Except for the exchange of the N terminus, all further alterations of the V2 receptor resulted in chimeric proteins with a slightly reduced affinity for AVP. Nevertheless, the receptor with the lowest binding affinity (E1234, Ki (AVP) = 8 nM) has a Ki for AVP that is still as high as that of the OT receptor Ki (AVP) = 7 nM (Table I). Our main interest was to designate OT receptor domains which determine its ligand binding specificity. Under this aspect it is helpful to compare differences in the ligand binding spectra of investigated constructs. To standardize each spectrum, the Ki values of the tested ligands were related to the Ki of AVP (Table I). For a given receptor the relative affinity to AVP (Krel) is the Ki of the considered ligand divided by the Ki of AVP at the same receptor. In principle Krel values describe the position of the displacement curves (Fig. 3) relative to each other. The exchange of the second extracellular domain (or first extracellular loop) in the V2 receptor led to the chimeric E2 receptor. The relative affinity for AVT (Krel = 11) was unchanged as compared with the V2 receptor (Krel = 9.3). On the other hand, the relative affinities for OP and OT were slightly enhanced by a factor of 2 and 1.6, respectively (Krel(OP) = 16.5, Krel(OP at the V2 receptor) = 33.6 and Krel(OT) = 244, Krel(OT at the V2 receptor) = 388). As found for the chimera E1, only the binding of the more hydrophobic hormones OP and OT was increased, indicating that also the first extracellular loop of the OT receptor interacts with the linear part of the hormones. The effect is not as significant as observed for the N-terminal exchange but is in accordance to results of point mutations in this loop within the porcine V2 receptor. By the mutation Y102D the role of this position in the V2 receptor for agonist specificity and for interaction with the C-terminal tripeptidic part of vasopressin has been demonstrated (17Ufer E. Postina R. Gorbulev V. Fahrenholz F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mutation in the equivalent position (Y115F) of the rat V1a receptor led to a 19-fold increase of OT and OP binding (5-fold increase relative to AVP binding) as compared with the native receptor (20Chini B. Mouillac B. Ala Y. Balestre M.-N. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Elands J. Hibert M. Manning M. Jard S. Barberis C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2176-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the present study the mutation Y102F resulted in a V2 receptor with unchanged affinity for AVT and a 3-fold enhanced affinity for OP and OT (Krel values, Table I) which provides further evidence that Phe102 is involved in an interaction with Leu8 in the linear tripeptidic part of OT and OP. The exchange of the third extracellular domain (or second extracellular loop) in the V2 receptor for the corresponding domain of the OT receptor resulted in the chimera E3. As compared with the V2 receptor, this chimera revealed a 2-3-fold increase of OT (Krel = 116) and AVT (Krel = 4.3) binding, whereas the binding of OP (Krel = 33.1) was not affected. AVP and OP on the one hand and AVT and OT on the other are identical in their cyclic hormone parts. Therefore, the participation of this domain in binding to the hormone cyclus, in particular to Ile3, appears likely. This hypothesis is supported by the results obtained with chimera E13 (see below). Neither the exchange of the fourth extracellular domain (chimera E4) nor the exchange of an extended domain, including the third loop and the first third of the seventh transmembrane domain (chimera E4+), had a significant effect on agonist binding. Interestingly, the third extracellular OT receptor loop is not as strictly conserved in different species as the first and second loop. As compared with all other chimeric receptors, the additional part of the seventh transmembrane domain resulted in a distinct reduction of [3H]AVP binding sites in the cell membrane. The receptor density was now similar to that of the wild-type OT receptor (Bmax≈2 pmol/mg). From the results that the first extracellular domain interacts with the linear part"

The cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in spite of its apparent rigidity, is a highly dynamic structure. Its general biological functions include mechanical protection, determination of cell shape, and modulation of selective uptake of molecules. Moreover, yeast are able to alter the composition and/or the structure of their cell wall throughout the different stages of their life cycle such as budding, mating, and sporulation. Such plasticity requires the coordinated regulation of the expression of genes involved in the formation of the cell wall. Although cell wall assembly and its regulation have been extensively studied during vegetative growth (1Cid J.V. Duran A. del Rey F. Snyder P.M. Nombela C. Sanchez M. Microbiol.

Yeast. 1994; 10: 1741-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), there is limited information on the composition and formation of the more complex ascospore cell wall. Sporulation is the developmental stage that diploid cells enter when starved for nitrogen and a fermentable carbon source. It proceeds with meiosis followed by the encapsulation of the four haploid nuclei within the spore wall. This wall offers increased protection to stress conditions as compared to the wall of vegetative cells (4Miller J.J. Rose A.H. Harrison J.S. The Yeasts. Academic Press, New York1989: 3/489-3/550Google Scholar) and consists of four layers (5Kreger-van Rij N.J.W. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 117: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Briza P.

The two inner layers are formed by closely juxtaposed glucans and mannans and appear as a single layer very similar in morphology to the vegetative cell wall (6Briza P. Ellinger A. Winkler G.

The outermost layer consists of an insoluble macromolecule, probably a protein, which contains a high number of cross-linked tyrosine residues (8Briza P. Winkler G. Kalchhauser H. Breitenbach M. J.

Chitosan, a β-(1→4)-D-glucosamine homopolymer, was initially detected in the cell wall of Zygomycete species (11Bartnicki-Garcia S. Nickerson W.J. Biochem. Biophys.

Nuero M.O. Santamaria F. Reyes F. Curr. Microbiol. 1995; 30: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The involvement of this enzyme in plant-pathogen interactions has also been proposed (19Kauss H. Jeblick W. Young H.D. Plant Sci. Lett. 1983; 28: 231-236Crossref Google Scholar, 20Tsigos I.

The isolation of the first CDA-encoding gene from the fungus Mucor rouxii revealed a remarkable sequence similarity to the rhizobial nodB proteins, suggesting functional homology of these evolutionary distant proteins (21Kafetzopoulos D.

Subsequently, it was verified biochemically that nodB proteins are chitooligosaccharide deacetylases (22John M. Rohring H. Schmidt J. Wieneke U. Shell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2564-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the identification and molecular characterization of two sporulation-specific genes, CDA1 and CDA2, whose products account for the total chitin deacetylase activity in S. cerevisiae. Mutational analysis of the two genes revealed that CDA contributes to spore wall resistance. The strain used for temporal analysis of CDA expression was the DKB96 diploid (MATa/MATα, ura3/ura3, leu2/leu2, his4/his4) kindly provided by Dr. D. Bishop. The strains used for the construction of the disruption alleles of CDA1 and CDA2 were FY104 (MATa, ura3, trp1, his3), the S288C derivative GT44 (MATα, gcn4, ura3, trp1) and their diploid derivative GT44D (MATα/MATa, gcn4/GCN4, HIS3/his3 ura3/ura3, trp1/trp1). Complete, minimal, and sporulation media were as described previously (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith A.J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). For synchronous sporulation cells were grown in sporulation medium to a density of 3 × 107cells/ml, washed, and resuspended in SPM (0.3% potassium acetate, 0.02% glucose, and appropriate supplements) at the same density. The efficiency of sporulation of DKB96 strain was >95% after 36 h and 15% for all other strains, after 3 days under the same conditions. Ascus formation was monitored by light microscopy using phase-contrast optics. The CDA1 and CDA2 genes were isolated from a YCP50 yeast genomic library (24Driscoll-Penn M. Thireos G. Greer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide as a probe. Two overlapping clones were chosen, one of which was used for the isolation of a 1.2-kb XbaI fragment of CDA1 and the other for the isolation of a 1.3-kb EcoRI fragment of CDA2. These were used for disruption experiments. For the expression experiment, two DNA fragments carrying the entire coding region of CDA1 and CDA2 were generated by a polymerase chain reaction using specific primers and were cloned into the pYES2 (Invitrogen) expression vector carrying the GAL1 promoter region. (i) For CDA1 disruption, a NcoI-HpaI 572-bp fragment (−441, +131) was replaced by a 1.1-kb HindIII URA3 DNA fragment. The resulting 1.8-kb XbaI fragment was excised and used to transform ura3 strains of both mating types. (ii) For CDA2 disruption, a 346-bp StyI-NdeI fragment (+288, +634) was replaced by the 1.1-kb HindIII URA3 DNA fragment. A 2140-bp EcoRI fragment was excised and used to transform ura3 strains of both mating types. (iii) For CDA1 and CDA2 double disruption, the SmaI-XbaI 550-bp fragment of the CDA1 disruption plasmid (the SmaI site was created after the insertion of URA3 gene at its end) was replaced by a NdeI-EcoRI 300-bp fragment of the CDA2 region. The resulting construct had the URA3 gene inserted between the 5′ of the CDA1 and the 3′ of the CDA2 regions. The resulting 1950-bp XbaI-EcoRI was excised and used to transform ura3 strains of both mating type. Yeast DNA was prepared as described previously (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith A.J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar), digested with EcoRI or XbaI, electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel, and transferred to GenScreen membranes (Dupont NEN). Membranes were hybridized with two different α-32P-labeled probes, either a 1.2-kb XbaI CDA1 fragment or a 1.3-kb EcoRI CDA2 fragment. No cross-hybridization of the two genes was observed using these probes. Cells (at a concentration of 5 × 107/ml) were collected by centrifugation at 2-h intervals following transfer to sporulation medium and total RNA was isolated by the glass bead/phenol procedure (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith A.J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). For Northern hybridization analysis RNA was electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel containing 15% formaldehyde and transferred to GenScreen membrane (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith A.J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). The same membrane filter was sequentially hybridized with α-32P-labeled 1.2-kb XbaI CDA1 DNA fragment and with α-32P-labeled 1.3-kb EcoRI CDA2 DNA fragment. Cell extracts were isolated, at the same time intervals as for the RNA analysis, disrupted with glass beads in a 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm to remove cell debris. For the determination of chitin deacetylase activity we have employed a radiometric assay using as substrate partially O-hydroxyethylated chitin (glycol chitin), radiolabeled in N-acetyl groups. The substrate was prepared according to Araki and Ito (25Araki Y. Ito E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 161: 510-512Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were performed as described previously (16Kafetzopoulos D. Martinou A. Bouriotis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2564-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer at 55°C for 30 min. One unit of enzymatic activity releases 1.0 μmol of [3H]acetic acid from glycol chitin per min. Wild type and mutant strains were streaked in YPD plates, grown at 30°C, and replica-plated onto nitrocellulose filters. Filters were grown in YPD plates for 1 day and then transferred to sporulation plates for 3 days. Filters were treated with Glusulase (Sigma) with a mixture of 200 μl of H2O, 70 μl of undiluted Glusulase, and 15 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. After 5 h at 30°C, filters were transferred to 30% NH3, and their fluorescence was visualized after exposure to UV light (315 nm) (10Briza P. Breitenbach M. Ellinger A. Segall J.

Sporulated cells from the above filters were resuspended in undiluted Glusulase at 30°C in a hemocytometer chamber, and their lysis was observed by light microscopic examination. Resistance of spores to diethyl ether was assessed as described in Law and Segall (26Law D.T.S. Segall J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 912-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the viability of cells after exposure to 55°C was determined as described by Briza et al. (9Briza P. Winkler G. Ellinger A. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) The M. rouxii CDA sequence was compared against the GenBank™/EMBL data base using FastA (27Pearson V.R. Lipman J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9328) Google Scholar) of the Genetics Computer Group package software (28Devereux J. Haberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9509-9524Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar). Multiple alignment of similar protein sequences was performed using the PILEUP algorithm. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of M. rouxii chitin deacetylase (21Kafetzopoulos D. Thireos G. Vournakis N.J. Bouriotis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8005-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with the EMBL data base revealed the existence of two similar and closely linked open reading frames (EMBL accession no. for the region, U17247) on chromosome XII of S. cerevisiae. The homology exhibited with M. rouxii CDA was 24.5% over 284 amino acids for the first and 27.4% over 274 amino acids for the second open reading frame, CDA1 and CDA2, respectively. The predicted proteins (34.6 and 35.6 kDa, respectively) have an identity of 57% and a similarity of 72% throughout their entire amino acid sequence, with a gap of 10 amino acids starting at position 39 of CDA1. The two open reading frames are separated by 1411 nucleotides, and they are transcribed in the same orientation. No other genes were predicted in the intergenic region or in the 800-bp region upstream of CDA1. Multiple sequence alignments between a central region of M. rouxii CDA protein (extending from amino acids 121 to 325), Bacillus stearothermophilus putative deacetylase and the NodB protein family, which includes chitooligosaccharide (Nod factor precursors) deacetylases (22John M. Rohring H. Schmidt J. Wieneke U. Shell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2564-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), revealed conservation at specific residues (21Kafetzopoulos D. Thireos G. Vournakis N.J. Bouriotis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8005-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We performed a new alignment with the inclusion of the newly identified ScCDA1 and ScCDA2 genes, which confirmed the conservation for most of these residues, designating more accurately the invariant ones (Fig. 1). The above sequence comparison studies prompted us to investigate the function of CDA1 and CDA2 genes. Toward this goal the two genes were isolated from a yeast genomic plasmid library using an oligonucleotide probe, designed according to the published sequence (for the restriction map, see Fig. 5A).Fig. 5A, restriction map for selected enzymes of the DNA region containing the CDA1 and CDA2 genes. Abbreviations of the different restriction enzyme names are as follows: X, XbaI; H, HpaI; Nc, NcoI; E, EcoRI; S, StyI; Nd, NdeI. The coding regions of CDA1 and CDA2 are boxed. For Southern blot analysis, CDA1 and CDA2 genes were detected using probe 1 and 2, respectively, from regions indicated by two-pointed arrows. Horizontal bars denote regions of the genome replaced by a 1.1-kb HindIII fragment containing the URA3 gene in order to construct the mutant strains Δcda1, Δcda2, and Δcda1Δcda2. B, Southern blot analysis of CDA1 and CDA2 gene disrupted strains. Samples of genomic DNA isolated from diploid strains containing a disruption and deletion of CDA1 (Δcda1), CDA2 (Δcda2), or both (Δcda1Δcda2) as well as the parental wild-type strain were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We were not able to detect any CDA transcripts in vegetatively grown cells. Since expression of many genes encoding sporulation specific functions is developmentally regulated, we examined the transcription of the putative CDA genes during the process of sporulation, when the chitosan layer of spore walls is formed (6Briza P. Ellinger A. Winkler G. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11569-11574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from MATa/MATα diploid cells was isolated from vegetatively grown cells and at various time intervals following transfer to sporulation medium. RNA blot hybridization analysis using either probe 1 or 2 (Fig. 5A) revealed that transcripts for both genes began to accumulate 9 h after transfer to sporulation medium (Fig. 2). At that time mature asci had not yet appeared (Fig. 3). Maximal accumulation of CDA transcripts occurred at 15 h, and the transcripts almost disappeared after 19 h. The two genes exhibited exactly the same transcriptional pattern and accumulated to comparable levels, a conclusion based on the use of probes of similar specific activity. The appearance of these transcripts was diploid specific since they were not detected in either vegetative or starved haploid cells (not shown).Fig. 3Sporulation specific synthesis of CDA1 and CDA2 enzymes determined by CDA activity assays before and at various hours following transfer to sporulation medium. CDA activity values are given (dark bars). In parallel, the percentage of sporulation (light bars) was also monitored by light microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The samples used for the RNA analysis were also assayed for CDA activity (Fig. 3). No activity was detected during vegetative growth. However, during the process of sporulation CDA activity accumulated in parallel with the transcriptional pattern, but with a 2-h delay. Thus, the progressive increase of CDA activity was initiated at 9 h and reached maximal levels at 17 h. Approximately half of this activity persisted at 27 h, when sporulation was completed and one third of maximal activity remained even after 36 h. In order to examine the effects of unregulated expression of each CDA gene, the coding regions of the CDA1 and CDA2 genes were placed downstream of a GAL1 promoter region. These constructs were introduced into haploid cells which were grown first in glucose and then transferred to galactose minimal medium, to induce CDA gene expression. RNA blot hybridization analysis showed that transcripts of the two genes were accumulated in cells grown on galactose (Fig. 4B). Moreover, CDA activity, at levels comparable to that found in sporulating cells, was detected in the transformed cells, indicating that indeed these two genes encode for chitin deacetylases (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, it was concluded that an unregulated expression at these levels had no effect on haploid cell viability. In order to analyze the contribution of the two genes in the total CDA activity of S. cerevisiae, we constructed the disrupted mutant strains Δcda1, Δcda2, and Δcda1Δcda2 as shown in Fig. 5A. The disruptions were confirmed by DNA blot hybridization analysis (Fig. 5B). Normal growth of the disrupted strains in minimal medium indicated that the two genes were not essential for cell viability. CDA assays were performed in wild type, Δcda1, Δcda2, and Δcda1Δcda2 diploid strains during vegetative growth and at various stages of sporulation. Fig. 6 shows CDA activity detected just prior the formation of asci (0% sporulation) and after it reached a maximum when 30% of the cells were sporulated. The double disrupted Δcda1Δcda2 strain exhibited no CDA activity at any time during spore formation. Moreover, Δcda1 and Δcda2 exhibited approximately half of the activity measured in the wild type strain at the same time point. These results demonstrated that the proteins produced by these two genes account for the total S. cerevisiae CDA activity and that the two genes contribute essentially equally to the total CDA activity of the cell. In the Δcda1Δcda2 strain both the efficiency of spore formation and spore viability, as judged by light microscopy and growth assays, were not affected. Since mutant spores lacking each of the two outermost layers are sensitive to lytic enzymes and stress conditions (9Briza P. Winkler G. Ellinger A. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ballou C.E. Maitra K.S. Walker W.J. Whelan L.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yeast. 1992; 8: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we examined the sensitivity of the double and single disrupted strains to such treatments. The sensitivity to Glusulase was measured by monitoring either the natural fluorescence of yeast spores imparted by the dityrosine containing macromolecule of the outermost layer (10Briza P. Breitenbach M. Ellinger A. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1775-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), or by observing spore lysis. CDA mutants in parallel with wild type strains were allowed to sporulate on filters which were then transferred to undiluted Glusulase. After prolonged treatment with the enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”) double mutant strains failed to emit any fluorescence, while single mutants of both types and the wild type diploid strain exhibited normal fluorescence levels (Fig. 7). Moreover, double mutant spores were lysed by the action of this enzyme whereas single mutant and wild type spores were resistant, as revealed by observation of Glusulase exposed mutant spores under a phase contrast microscope (not shown). The fact that one of the two genes was sufficient to restore normal resistance of the spore wall suggested that the two genes are functionally redundant. The sensitivity of mutant spores to elevated temperature and ether was also tested. We examined the spore thermotolerence of the wild type and the double disrupted strain after exposure to 55°C for various periods of time (Fig. 8B). Mutant spore viability was two orders of magnitude lower following a 40-min exposure to elevated temperature, as compared to the wild type spores. We also examined the sensitivity of the above spores on ether exposure. As shown in Fig. 8A double disrupted spores were significantly more sensitive than wild type spores. However, in both tests, mutant strains were more resistant than stationary phase cells. These results indicated that chitin deacetylases contributed to the formation of an ascospore wall, resistant to stress conditions. Chitin deacetylase is one of the components of the binary enzyme system leading to chitosan formation in the cell walls of the Zygomycete M. rouxii. The other component is chitin synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of nascent chitin chains upon which CDA acts, removing the N-linked acetyl groups (12Davis L.L. Bartnicki Garcia S. Biochemistry. 1983; 23: 1065-1073Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the second of the four layers forming the ascospore wall in S. cerevisiae consists of chitosan (6Briza P. Ellinger A. Winkler G. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11569-11574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is reasonable to assume that a similar mode to that of M. rouxii operates for its biosynthesis, i.e. the coordinated involvement of chitin synthase and chitin deacetylase (6Briza P. Ellinger A. Winkler G. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11569-11574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bulawa C.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 505-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Yeast chitin synthase has been extensively studied (32Shaw J.A. Mol P.C. Bowers B. Silverman S.J. Valdivieso M.H. Duran A. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Three different enzymes have been detected, each one being nonessential, but lack of all three leads to cell lethality (32Shaw J.A. Mol P.C. Bowers B. Silverman S.J. Valdivieso M.H. Duran A. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Although none of these genes is strictly sporulation specific, chitin synthase III is the possible candidate for chitin synthesis in spores since the levels of CSD2 message, the gene presumed to encode for its catalytic subunit (33Bulawa C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1764-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 34Valdivieso M.H. Mol P.C. Shaw J.A. Cabib E. Duran A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), increase during sporulation (35Choi W. Santos B. Duran A. Cabib E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7685-7694Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and no chitosan is detected in mutants lacking this gene (30Pammer M. Briza P. Ellinger A. Schuster T. Stucka R. Feldmann H. Breitenbach M. Yeast. 1992; 8: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no study concerning chitin deacetylase has ever been reported. We have cloned and characterized the CDA1 and CDA2 genes encoding two proteins with significant similarity to the M. rouxii CDA protein. These genes indeed encode for chitin deacetylase as shown by (a) the lack of CDA activity in Δcda1 and Δcda2 double disrupted strains and (b) the presence of such an activity upon expression of the cloned genes during vegetative growth. In addition, the fact that the total CDA activity from sporulating cells is abolished when both genes are deleted strongly suggests that no other gene in yeast encodes for chitin deacetylase. Deletion of each gene separately reduces the levels of CDA activity to approximately half indicating that the activities of these enzymes are additive. The assumption that yeast chitin deacetylase activity has a unique role in sporulation, came from studies on the expression of the CDA1 and CDA2 genes. Both are expressed specifically during sporulation, in accordance with the existence of chitosan only in this developmental stage of the S. cerevisiae life cycle (6Briza P. Ellinger A. Winkler G. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11569-11574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substantial accumulation of CDA1 and CDA2 mRNA is observed 9 h following transfer to sporulation medium, just prior to the formation of asci. Thus, these two genes probably belong to the mid-late class of sporulation specific genes (10Briza P. Breitenbach M. Ellinger A. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1775-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 36Mitchel P.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 56-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two other genes, DIT1 and DIT2, that are involved in the formation of the ascospore wall are also expressed with similar developmental specificity as the CDA genes (10Briza P. Breitenbach M. Ellinger A. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1775-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although we have not detected any potential common promoter elements among these four genes, we expect that the key regulators of sporulation specific genes, including DIT1 and DIT2, IME1 and IME2, should play an important role in the expression of the CDA genes (36Mitchel P.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 56-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hepworth R.S. Ebisuzaki K.L. Segall J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Within 2 h after the appearance of CDA transcripts, chitin deacetylase activity can be detected. This delay might indicate that the enzyme is produced initially as a zymogen and finally is secreted in the periplasmic space, as is the case for the M. rouxii enzyme (14Bartnicki-Garcia, S., Skjark-Braek, G., Anthonsen, T., Sandford, P., (eds) (1989) Chitin and Chitosan: Sources, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physical Properties and Applications, pp. 23–35, Elsevier, Essex.Google Scholar). In order to investigate the importance of the chitin deacetylation process to cell wall assembly, we took advantage of the natural fluorescence that wild type spores emit when excited by ultraviolet light, as well as their resistance to hydrolytic enzymes, ether, and heat shock (8Briza P. Winkler G. Kalchhauser H. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4288-4294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Briza P. Breitenbach M. Ellinger A. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1775-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The fluorescence is due to the bulk of dityrosine residues which are located in the outermost layer of the ascospore wall (8Briza P. Winkler G. Kalchhauser H. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4288-4294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type cells and single Δcda disruptants exhibit no differences in fluorescence or in Glusulase sensitivity, heat shock and ether, indicating that even one CDA gene is sufficient for the proper formation of spore wall. On the contrary, a strain in which both CDA genes are deleted, is sensitive to the above treatments and its natural fluorescence is lost after enzymatic hydrolysis. The unequivocal existence of a chitin deacetylase in S. cerevisiae and its importance to cell wall resistance against glucolytic enzymes and stress conditions, reinforces the hypothesis that a mechanism of chitosan biosynthesis similar to that of M. rouxii operates and that chitosan is produced by deacetylation of chitin (6Briza P. Ellinger A. Winkler G. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11569-11574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bulawa C.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 505-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Similar phenotypes to those of the Δcda null mutants are also exhibited by mutations that affect chitin synthesis, such as glucosamine auxotrophies (29Ballou C.E. Maitra K.S. Walker W.J. Whelan L.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4351-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the formation of the chitosan layer, such as dit101 (30Pammer M. Briza P. Ellinger A. Schuster T. Stucka R. Feldmann H. Breitenbach M. Yeast. 1992; 8: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the formation of dityrosine bridges, such as dit1 and dit2 (9Briza P. Winkler G. Ellinger A. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Briza P. Breitenbach M. Ellinger A. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1775-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The lack of chitin deacetylation in a ΔcdaΔcda2 strain presumably leaves the second ascospore wall layer untransformed, consisting of pure chitin instead of chitosan. Briza et al. (6Briza P. Ellinger A. Winkler G. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11569-11574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the chitosan layer is somehow associated with the dityrosine-containing macromolecules of the outermost layer and appears to be prerequisite for dityrosine incorporation. Possibly, these interactions are disrupted when the positively charged amino groups are acetylated, leading to a loosely packed structure susceptible to hydrolytic enzymes and stress conditions. Recent information about chitin deacetylases from different species revealed that although these enzymes have the same catalytic activity and stringent specificity for chitinous substrates, they are involved in many different biological processes depending on the individual organism. Thus in fungi M. rouxii and Absidia coerula, CDAs are constitutively expressed enzymes (16Kafetzopoulos D. Martinou A. Bouriotis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2564-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Gao X. Katsumoto T. Onodera K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), localized in the periplasmic space (14Bartnicki-Garcia, S., Skjark-Braek, G., Anthonsen, T., Sandford, P., (eds) (1989) Chitin and Chitosan: Sources, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physical Properties and Applications, pp. 23–35, Elsevier, Essex.Google Scholar) in order to perform their task in cell wall construction, whereas in the plant pathogen Colletotrichum lindemuthianum and in Aspergillus nidulans CDAs are secreted enzymes postulated to act on chitin oligomers released by fungal cell walls, in order to promote plant invasion (20Tsigos I. Bouriotis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26286-26291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or cell wall degradation (18Alfonso C. Nuero M.O. Santamaria F. Reyes F. Curr. Microbiol. 1995; 30: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In procaryotes, the NodB family of genes encodes CDA which participates in the biosynthesis of the Nod factors that promote plant nodulation (21Kafetzopoulos D. Thireos G. Vournakis N.J. Bouriotis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8005-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22John M. Rohring H. Schmidt J. Wieneke U. Shell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8005-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Given this diversity in the biological functions of CDA, the availability of the S. cerevisiae Δcda mutant phenotype as well as the easily measurable CDA activity offer important tools not only toward understanding of cell wall formation but also toward the elucidation of the structure-function relationships of chitin deacetylases.

https://openalex.org/W2056976451,"Transfection of COS7 cells with a plasmid encoding the human cyclic AMP-specific PDE4A phosphodiesterase PDE-46 (HSPDE4A4B) led to the expression of a rolipram-inhibited PDE4 activity, which contributed ∼96% of the total COS cell PDE activity. A fusion protein was generated which encompassed residues (788-886) at the extreme C terminus of PDE-46 and was used to generate an antiserum that detected PDE-46 in transfected COS7 cells. Immunoblotting studies identified PDE-46 as a ∼125-kDa species that was associated with both the soluble and particulate fractions. The relative <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of particulate PDE-46 was ∼56% that of cytosolic PDE-46. Particulate PDE-46 was not solubilized using Triton X-100 or high NaCl concentrations. Immunofluorescence analysis by laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that PDE-46 was located at discrete margins of the cell, indicative of association with membrane cortical regions. The human PDE4A species, h6.1 (HSPDE4A4C), which lacks the N-terminal extension of PDE-46, was found as an entirely soluble species when expressed in COS7 cells. h6.1 was shown to have an ∼11-fold higher <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> relative to that of PDE-46. In dose-response studies rolipram inhibited particulate PDE-46 at much lower concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.195 μM) than those needed to inhibit the cytosolic enzyme (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.6 μM). The basis of this difference lay in the fact that rolipram served as a simple competitive inhibitor of the cytosol enzyme (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 1.6 μM) but as a partial competitive inhibitor of the particulate enzyme (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 0.037 μM; <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>′ = 2.3 μM).

https://openalex.org/W2167935796,"O-Acetylation of the 9-hydroxyl group of sialic acids has been suggested to modify various recognition phenomena involving these molecules, but direct proof has been lacking in most situations. In the accompanying paper (Shi, W.-X., Chammas, R., and Varki, A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 31517-31525), we report that the extent of 9-O-acetylation of cell surface sialic acids on murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells can be modified by various manipulations, including differentiation, nocodazole treatment, and 9-O-acetyl esterase treatment. We have used this system to explore the putative roles of 9-O-acetylation in modulating alternative pathway complement activation, I-type lectin binding, and tissue homing. MEL cells are shown to be sensitive to lysis in vitro by the alternative pathway of human complement. Induced differentiation of the MEL cells causes resistance to lysis, and this correlates directly with extent of decrease in 9-O-acetylation. A similar resistance to alternative pathway lysis can be obtained by selective enzymatic removal of 9-O-acetyl groups from sialic acids. Conversely, the increase in cell surface 9-O-acetylation caused by nocodazole treatment correlates with increased sensitivity to alternative pathway lysis. Thus, a 9-O-acetyl group added to the side chain of cell surface sialic acids may abrogate its normal function in restricting alternative pathway activation. Indeed, the binding of human complement factor H, a negative regulator of the alternative pathway, is shown to be blocked by O-acetylation of the sialic acids on MEL cells. MEL cells are also shown to have cell surface ligands for the I-type lectins sialoadhesin and CD22. Sialoadhesin (but not CD22) binding is selectively enhanced by differentiation-induced loss of cell surface 9-O-acetylation and by direct enzymatic removal of the ester groups. Thus, some sialoadhesin ligands are masked by 9-O-acetylation, presumably because the side chain is required for recognition. Since sialoadhesin is expressed on some macrophages in vivo, we reasoned that tissue homing of MEL cells might be affected by O-acetylation. Indeed, enzymatic removal of cell surface 9-O-acetyl groups alters the tissue distribution of intravenously injected cells. In particular, de-O-acetylation caused significant increase in homing to the liver and spleen. These data demonstrate that cell surface 9-O-acetylation can affect a variety of biological recognition phenomena and provide a system for further exploration of the specific molecular mechanisms involved."
https://openalex.org/W2032847998,"The insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-I) receptor can become tyrosine phosphorylated and enzymatically activated either in response to ligand or because of the activity of the Src tyrosine kinase (Peterson, J. E., Jelinek, T., Kaleko, M., Siddle, K., and Weber, M. J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 27315-27321). The goal of the present study was to analyze the mechanistic basis and functional significance of the Src-induced phosphorylation and activation of the IGF-I receptor. 1) We mapped the sites of IGF-I receptor autophosphorylation to peptides representing three different receptor domains: tyrosines 943 and 950 in the juxtamembrane region; tyrosines 1131, 1135, and 1136 within the kinase domain; and tyrosine 1316 in the carboxyl-terminal domain. The juxtamembrane and kinase-domain peptides were phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro. The carboxyl-terminal site, although phosphorylated in vitro and in src-transformed cells, was not a major site of ligand-induced phosphorylation in vivo. 2) We determined that the sites of Src-induced phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor are the same as the ligand-induced autophosphorylation sites and that the Src kinase can catalyze these phosphorylations directly. 3) We showed that cells cultured from mice in which the IGF-I receptor has been knocked out by homologous recombination are defective for morphological transformation by src. Thus, the Src kinase can substitute for the receptor kinase in phosphorylating and activating the IGF-I receptor, and this receptor phosphorylation and activation are essential for transformation by src. The insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-I) receptor can become tyrosine phosphorylated and enzymatically activated either in response to ligand or because of the activity of the Src tyrosine kinase (Peterson, J. E., Jelinek, T., Kaleko, M., Siddle, K., and Weber, M. J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 27315-27321). The goal of the present study was to analyze the mechanistic basis and functional significance of the Src-induced phosphorylation and activation of the IGF-I receptor. 1) We mapped the sites of IGF-I receptor autophosphorylation to peptides representing three different receptor domains: tyrosines 943 and 950 in the juxtamembrane region; tyrosines 1131, 1135, and 1136 within the kinase domain; and tyrosine 1316 in the carboxyl-terminal domain. The juxtamembrane and kinase-domain peptides were phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro. The carboxyl-terminal site, although phosphorylated in vitro and in src-transformed cells, was not a major site of ligand-induced phosphorylation in vivo. 2) We determined that the sites of Src-induced phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor are the same as the ligand-induced autophosphorylation sites and that the Src kinase can catalyze these phosphorylations directly. 3) We showed that cells cultured from mice in which the IGF-I receptor has been knocked out by homologous recombination are defective for morphological transformation by src. Thus, the Src kinase can substitute for the receptor kinase in phosphorylating and activating the IGF-I receptor, and this receptor phosphorylation and activation are essential for transformation by src.

The normal function of insulin is primarily to regulate metabolism in liver, fat, and muscle, whereas IGF-I acts to regulate growth and differentiation. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the IGF-I receptor because of its ability to inhibit apoptosis (Harrington et al., 18Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 19Harrington E.A. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar).Normal activation of insulin family receptors occurs through ligand binding by the α-subunits, which results in activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase. Increased receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine occurs through intersubunit phosphorylation between the two β-subunits, and it is the phosphorylation of these tyrosines that regulates the activity of the receptor (Rosen et al., 45Rosen O.M.

Signaling via the insulin and IGF-I receptors requires both a functional tyrosine kinase and also the phosphorylation of conserved tyrosines within the β-subunit of the receptors.The sequence homology between the insulin and IGF-I receptor β-subunits is highest in the tyrosine kinase domain (85%), intermediate in the juxtamembrane region (61%), and lowest in their cytoplasmic tails (44%) (Ullrich et al., 64Ullrich A.

Interestingly, nearly all of the insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation sites important for signaling are conserved within the IGF-I receptor. This includes both tyrosines located in the juxtamembrane domain, the triplet of tyrosines in the kinase domain, and (although with less conservation of contextual sequence) one of the two tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain. However, in spite of the central importance of the IGF-I receptor in growth and malignant transformation, no work prior to what is reported here has directly determined whether these conserved tyrosines in fact represent the major sites of IGF-I receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine.Table IComparison of the tyrosine-containing tryptic peptides from the β-subunits of the IGF-I receptor (top) and the insulin receptor, (bottom)Peptide no.Pro-receptor residue no.Amino acid sequence of tryptic peptides from the intracellular β-subunit of the IGF-I (top) and insulin (bottom) receptorsTyrosine at residue no. from peptide amino terminusI937–966LGNGVLYASVNPEYFSAAD—–VYVPDEWEVAR7, 14, 21944–981QPDGPL.P….S….L..S.vfpcs………S.10, 17, 29II974–989ELGQGSFGMVYEGVAK11989–1004………….N.R11III1059–1062SYLR21074–1077….2IV1082–1100MIQMAGEIADGMAYLNANK141090–1114P..T.QE…..A………..K21V1129–1137DIYETDYYR3, 7, 81144–1152………3, 7, 8VI1156–1193DGVFTTYSDVWSFGVVLWEIATLAEQPYQGLSNEQVLR7, 281171–1208……S..M……….TS……………K28VII1193–1209FVMEGGLLDKPDNCPDM01209–1225…D..Y..Q…..ER7VIII1217–1224MCWQYNPK51232–1239….F..N0IX1246–1256EVSFYYSEENK5, 61261–1271….FH…..0X1314–1323QPYAHMNGGR31315–1329.YE.HI..T…..K2, 8 Open table in a new tab It is well documented that phosphorylation on tyrosine is important for insulin and IGF-I receptor activation. Therefore, it is conceivable that a heterologous kinase capable of phosphorylating these tyrosines would also be capable of activating the receptor. Although IGF-I receptor activation normally requires the presence of IGF-I, there is some precedent for IGF-I receptor activation without its cognate ligand. For example, the insulin receptor can induce signaling by the IGF-I receptor through the formation of heterotetramers made up of one insulin receptor αβ dimer and one IGF-I receptor αβ dimer. Insulin binding to the insulin receptor leads to activation of the β-subunit of the IGF-I receptor through intersubunit phosphorylation within the hybrid receptor heterotetramer (McClain et al., 34McClain D.A.

Thrombin, perhaps via activation of pp60c−src, causes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor (Rao et al., 44Rao G.N. Delafontaine P. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27871-27875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Previous reports from this laboratory have shown that the transforming non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src induces the phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor in vivo (Kozma and Weber, 28Kozma L.M. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3626-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar; Kozma et al., 27Kozma L.M. Reynolds A.B. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27315-27321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Src-induced phosphorylation of the receptor was correlated with an increase in the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, both toward itself and exogenous substrates (Peterson et al., 42Peterson J.E. Jelinek T. Kaleko M. Siddle K. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27315-27321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Src-induced increase in receptor activity was shown to be dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, as treatment with a tyrosine-specific phosphatase lowered receptor activity (Peterson et al., 42Peterson J.E. Jelinek T. Kaleko M. Siddle K. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27315-27321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We hypothesized that the Src-induced phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor might be functionally important for transformation, because phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor was one of only a few phosphorylations out of 30 analyzed that correlated with phenotypic transformation in cells infected with a panel of partially transforming src mutants (Kozma and Weber, 28Kozma L.M. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3626-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar; Kozma et al., 27Kozma L.M. Reynolds A.B. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).In the present study, we identify the sites of IGF-I receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation in vivo and in vitro and show that they are homologous to regulatory sites in the insulin receptor. We also show that in vivo and in vitro, Src is capable of phosphorylating the same sites observed upon ligand-induced autophosphorylation and that this is likely due to direct phosphorylation by the Src kinase. Finally, we show that cells cultured from mice in which the IGF-I receptor has been knocked out by homologous recombination (Liu et al., 33Liu D. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6835-6840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Sell et al., 47Sell C. Baserga R. Rubin R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 303-306PubMed Google Scholar) are defective for transformation by src. Taken together, these data indicate that intracellular, ligand-independent phosphorylation and activation of the IGF-I receptor by the Src kinase occurs by a mechanism similar to ligand-induced autophosphorylation and that this interaction between Src and the IGF-I receptor is essential for transformation by this oncogene.

Interestingly, nearly all of the insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation sites important for signaling are conserved within the IGF-I receptor. This includes both tyrosines located in the juxtamembrane domain, the triplet of tyrosines in the kinase domain, and (although with less conservation of contextual sequence) one of the two tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain. However, in spite of the central importance of the IGF-I receptor in growth and malignant transformation, no work prior to what is reported here has directly determined whether these conserved tyrosines in fact represent the major sites of IGF-I receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine.Table IComparison of the tyrosine-containing tryptic peptides from the β-subunits of the IGF-I receptor (top) and the insulin receptor, (bottom)Peptide no.Pro-receptor residue no.Amino acid sequence of tryptic peptides from the intracellular β-subunit of the IGF-I (top) and insulin (bottom) receptorsTyrosine at residue no. from peptide amino terminusI937–966LGNGVLYASVNPEYFSAAD—–VYVPDEWEVAR7, 14, 21944–981QPDGPL.P….S….L..S.vfpcs………S.10, 17, 29II974–989ELGQGSFGMVYEGVAK11989–1004………….N.R11III1059–1062SYLR21074–1077….2IV1082–1100MIQMAGEIADGMAYLNANK141090–1114P..T.QE…..A………..K21V1129–1137DIYETDYYR3, 7, 81144–1152………3, 7, 8VI1156–1193DGVFTTYSDVWSFGVVLWEIATLAEQPYQGLSNEQVLR7, 281171–1208……S..M……….TS……………K28VII1193–1209FVMEGGLLDKPDNCPDM01209–1225…D..Y..Q…..ER7VIII1217–1224MCWQYNPK51232–1239….F..N0IX1246–1256EVSFYYSEENK5, 61261–1271….FH…..0X1314–1323QPYAHMNGGR31315–1329.YE.HI..T…..K2, 8 Open table in a new tab It is well documented that phosphorylation on tyrosine is important for insulin and IGF-I receptor activation. Therefore, it is conceivable that a heterologous kinase capable of phosphorylating these tyrosines would also be capable of activating the receptor. Although IGF-I receptor activation normally requires the presence of IGF-I, there is some precedent for IGF-I receptor activation without its cognate ligand. For example, the insulin receptor can induce signaling by the IGF-I receptor through the formation of heterotetramers made up of one insulin receptor αβ dimer and one IGF-I receptor αβ dimer. Insulin binding to the insulin receptor leads to activation of the β-subunit of the IGF-I receptor through intersubunit phosphorylation within the hybrid receptor heterotetramer (McClain et al., 34McClain D.A.

Thrombin, perhaps via activation of pp60c−src, causes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor (Rao et al., 44Rao G.N. Delafontaine P. Runge M.S. J. Biol.

Previous reports from this laboratory have shown that the transforming non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src induces the phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor in vivo (Kozma and Weber, 28Kozma L.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27315-27321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Src-induced phosphorylation of the receptor was correlated with an increase in the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, both toward itself and exogenous substrates (Peterson et al., 42Peterson J.E. Jelinek T. Kaleko M. Siddle K. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27315-27321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Src-induced increase in receptor activity was shown to be dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, as treatment with a tyrosine-specific phosphatase lowered receptor activity (Peterson et al., 42Peterson J.E. Jelinek T. Kaleko M. Siddle K. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27315-27321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We hypothesized that the Src-induced phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor might be functionally important for transformation, because phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor was one of only a few phosphorylations out of 30 analyzed that correlated with phenotypic transformation in cells infected with a panel of partially transforming src mutants (Kozma and Weber, 28Kozma L.M.

We also show that in vivo and in vitro, Src is capable of phosphorylating the same sites observed upon ligand-induced autophosphorylation and that this is likely due to direct phosphorylation by the Src kinase. Finally, we show that cells cultured from mice in which the IGF-I receptor has been knocked out by homologous recombination (Liu et al., 33Liu D. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6835-6840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Sell et al., 47Sell C. Baserga R. Rubin R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 303-306PubMed Google Scholar) are defective for transformation by src. Taken together, these data indicate that intracellular, ligand-independent phosphorylation and activation of the IGF-I receptor by the Src kinase occurs by a mechanism similar to ligand-induced autophosphorylation and that this interaction between Src and the IGF-I receptor is essential for transformation by this oncogene."

Aβ is derived from the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Proteolytic processing of APP by the enzyme, β-secretase, produces the N terminus of Aβ, and releases a secreted ectodomain of APP (β-s-APP). To develop animal models for measuring β-secretase activity in specific brain cells in vivo, we have targeted the expression of the full-length human APP to either neurons or astrocytes in transgenic mice using the neuron- specific enolase (NSE) promoter or a modified glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene, respectively. The APP cDNAs expressed were mutated (KM to NL at 670/671) to encode amino acid substitutions that enhance amyloidogenic processing in vitro. Western analyses revealed abundant production of β-s-APP in the brains of NSE-APP mice and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses showed production of Aβ in fetal primary mixed brain cultures and brain homogenates from these transgenic animals. Because the NSE promoter drives expression primarily in neurons, this provides in vivo evidence that the β-secretase cleavage necessary for generation of β-s-APP and Aβ is efficiently performed in neurons. In contrast, only little β-s-APP was detected in brain homogenates of GFAP-APP mice, indicating that astrocytes show very little β-secretase activity in vivo. This provides strong in vivo evidence that the major source of Aβ in brain is from neurons and not from astrocytes.

APP is expressed in all tissues, and the relative amount of Aβ processed from APP varies in different cell types in culture (3Busciglio J. Gabuzda D.H. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Mutations in APP are responsible for some forms of familial AD, supporting the hypothesis that APP and Aβ are central to the disease process (6Selkoe D.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Missense mutations immediately N-terminal to the Aβ region of APP 2The “Swedish” variant consists of a KM to NL change at positions 670/671 of 770-amino acid form of βAPP; all βAPP amino acid numbering in this manuscript refers to the 770-amino acid form of βAPP. lead to a 5-10-fold enhancement of Aβ produced from APP in vitro, strongly supporting the role of Aβ in the development of AD in this family (7Citron M.

Other families, with mutations at the 717 position of APP, have been shown to produce increased amounts of the more amyloidogenic 42-amino acid form of Aβ from APP (9Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D.

The majority of APP is cleaved in the middle of the Aβ region, releasing a secreted ectodomain containing the first 16 amino acids of Aβ (α-s-APP). This processing, mediated by an unidentified enzymatic activity termed “α-secretase” precludes Aβ formation (10Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1122-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). In an alternative pathway, cleavage between Met671 and Asp672 by a likewise unidentified enzyme named “β-secretase” produces the N-terminal end of Aβ and releases a secreted ectodomain composed of a truncated form ending with Met671 (β-s-APP) (4Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Lieberburg I. Schenck D.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Further processing of the C-terminal end of Aβ leads to the release of Aβ (3Busciglio J. Gabuzda D.H. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This alternative processing pathway has been identified in vitro in a variety of cell types; it appears to be more prominent in primary fetal mixed brain cultures (4Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G.

While previous studies have allowed enormous progress in elucidating the processing of APP in vitro, an in vivo model for β-secretase processing of APP would allow for characterization of these pathways in a living animal. To obtain in vivo models for studying β-secretase processing of APP in the brain, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the 751-amino acid form of human APP in either neurons or astrocytes. A mutated form of APP was expressed and a specific antibody to β-s-APP of that form used to assay the products of β-secretase in brain extracts. We report that β-secretase processing of APP was highly effective when this molecule was expressed in neurons and relatively ineffective when it was expressed in astrocytes of transgenic mice. In addition to helping identify the main cellular source of Aβ in the brain, these and related models should prove valuable for the screening for drugs that inhibit β-secretase activity.

Two PCR reactions containing either oligonucleotides 260 (GCG GGA GAT CTT TGC TCG GCA CGG CCC) and 1072 (CCC AGC CAT CAT GCT GCC CGG GTT GGC) or oligonucleotides carman 2 (ACC TGC CAC TAT ACT GGA ATA) and 1073 (GCC AAC CCG GGC AGC ATG ATG GCT GGG ATC TC) generated fragments that were linked together in a third PCR reaction using oligonucleotides 260 and carman 2. The product of this reaction was cleaved with KpnI to provide the 1-kb NSE/APP fusion DNA fragment. The 3.1-kb BglII to KpnI fragment of the NSE promoter was ligated to the 5′ end of the NSE/APP fusion fragment and the 3′ end of the NSE/APP fusion fragment was ligated to the KpnI to SpeI APP cDNA fragment. The PCR reactions were carried out using standard Cetus/Perkin-Elmer reagents with 25 rounds of 96°C for 90 s, 62°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 90 s, followed by 10 min at 72°C. Thus splicing sequences 5′ to the APP cDNA sequences are provided by intron 1 of the NSE gene in all NSE constructs. Swedish (KM to NL at positions 670/671 of the 770-amino acid APP form) mutations were introduced into APP by PCR mutagenesis and subcloned into APP using BglII and EcoRI (Swedish). All PCR-generated regions were verified by sequencing. In NSE-APP constructs, the SpeI site in the APP cDNA was fused either with SV40 early polyadenylation signals provided by the BclI to EcoRI fragment of SV40 or with the XhoI to PstI fragment of pL1 containing SV40 16S/19S late splice sequences (18Okayama H. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) plus SV40 early polyadenylation signals. The BamHI and EcoRI sites in the SV40 DNA were destroyed. The PvuII to EcoRI fragment of pBR322 providing plasmid replication sequences was flanked with NotI sites and placed with the PvuII site abutted to the 5′ end of the NSE promoter. For the generation of the GFAP-APP fusion gene, a cDNA encoding full-length human 751 form APP carrying the Swedish mutations (introduced as described above) was excised with NruI and SpeI, ligated with NotI linkers, and cloned via NotI into exon 1 of the modified murine GFAP gene as described (14Toggas S.M.

The APP-expressing vectors were used to make transgenic animals from B6×DBA (NSE) or B6×SJL (GFAP) mice using standard microinjection techniques. Founder transgenic animals, in which multiple copies of unrearranged vector DNA was inserted, were identified by Southern analysis of tail-derived DNA. The Chelsea 58 NSE line was subsequently crossed for three generations onto the B6×SJL background to rule out potential effects of strain differences. The strain background had no effect on experimental results. Primary cortical cultures were made from embryonic day 17 embryos by the method of Koh and Choi (19Koh J.Y. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci.

A 5% PEI solution was diluted 1:100 in 150 mM sodium borate, pH 8.3-8.5, and incubated on the plates at room temperature overnight. The PEI was removed and plates washed two times in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Plating medium was placed on the plates for at least 1 h prior to plating the cells. The tissue was trypsinized in 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA for 20 min at 37°C, 2 × 106 cells were plated per well, and cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were not further treated except to replace plating medium twice a week. For analysis of total APP levels, brains were homogenized in Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors containing 5-10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2-4 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5-10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1-2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenates were ultracentrifuged in a Beckman TL-100 rotor at 55,000 rpm (100,000 × g) for 10 min and the supernatants subjected to Western analysis using either human specific anti-5 or C-terminal reactive anti-6 antibodies at 0.4 μg/ml (also called anti-BX5 or anti-BX6) (20Oltersdorf T.

A polyclonal rabbit antibody specific for rat and mouse Aβ was generated against the rat Aβ 1-28. Immunogen was prepared as follows. 10 mg of KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin, Pierce) was reconstituted and buffer exchanged into 0.3 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and diluted in the same buffer to a concentration of 2 mg/ml. 5 mg of rat Aβ 1-28 peptide was dissolved in 5 ml of deionized water and added to the KLH. 50 mg of disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) was dissolved in 1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma). 300 μl of the disuccinimidyl suberate stock was added to the KLH/peptide solution and rocked on a nutator for 3 h at room temperature. The conjugate was dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline. Coupling was determined by a gel band shift by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 6% Novex gel. Rabbits were immunized by standard protocol (Josman Laboratories) with the immunogen. Antibody was affinity-purified using Rat 1-28 peptide coupled to actigel resin. The purpose of this study was to examine the metabolism of human APP in transgenic mice in two major cell types of the adult central nervous system, neurons and astrocytes. Regulatory sequences from the rat NSE gene and from the murine GFAP gene were used to target expression of human APP to neurons or astrocytes, respectively (Fig. 1). Since the APP 670/671 KM to NL “Swedish” mutation has been shown in tissue culture systems to increase the products of β-secretase activity, Aβ (7Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L.

Furthermore, inclusion of this mutation allowed us to specifically detect β-secretase processing of the transgene-derived human APP. Therefore, the transgenic lines in this study were generated using fusion genes encoding this mutant form of APP. The NSE-APP and GFAP-APP transgenic mice generated allowed comparison of β-secretase activities in neurons versus astrocytes. The expression of APP in the brains of these animals was determined by Western analysis of brain homogenates (Fig. 2). Western blots were probed with the human specific APP antibody, anti-5 (also called anti-BX5 (20Oltersdorf T. Ward P.J. Henriksson T. Beattie E.C. Neve R. Lieberburg I. Fritz L.C. J. Biol.

This is in contrast to results obtained with fusion genes containing the SV40 small t splice in a similar position, as deletion of this splice in the 3′ position resulted in improved expression levels when a 5′ splice sequence is present (28Palmiter R.D.

This discrepancy could relate to differences in the SV40 splice sequences used and/or to effects exerted by other elements of the distinct transgenes expressed. Diverse neural injuries result in reactive astrocytosis, which is characterized by a variety of changes in astroglial morphology and molecular profile (31Eddleston M. Mucke L. Neuroscience. 1993; 54: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Brain injury has also been shown to up-regulate the astroglial expression of APP (32Kawarabayashi T. Shoji M. Harigaya Y. Yamaguchi H. Hirai S. Brain Res. 1991; 563: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 33Siman R. Card J.P. Nelson R.B. Davis L.G.

Neurology. 1990; 40: 33-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, because of the injury responsiveness of the GFAP gene, gliosis-provoking maneuvers such as focal penetrating brain lesions effectively up-modulate the astroglial expression of the GFAP-driven transgenes (36Mucke L. Oldstone M.B. Morris J.C. Nerenberg M.I. New Biol. 1991; 3: 465-474PubMed Google Scholar, 37Johnson W.B. Ruppe M.D. Rockenstein E.M. Price J. Sarthy V.P. Verderber L.C. Mucke L. Glia (N. Y.). 1995; 13: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore transgene expression was also tested 2 days after the placement of focal cerebral penetrating lesions. As expected, lesioning resulted in a substantial increase in the cerebral expression of human APP in mice transgenic for GFAP-APP (Table I, Fig. 5). While the copious amounts of Aβ in brain homogenates of Alzheimer's diseased patients can be readily measured (38Gravina S.A. Ho L. Eckman C.B. Long K.E. Otvos Jr., L. Younkin L.H. Suzuki N. Younkin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7013-7016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), the detection of Aβ present in normal brain tissue is technically difficult. Because it has also been difficult to measure Aβ in brain homogenates of transgenic mice with these moderate levels of human APP expression, an in vitro approach was first used to obtain evidence for the production of human Aβ peptide by neurons of NSE-APP transgenic mice. Primary cortical cultures were generated from heterozygous fetal transgenic mice from line Hillary 14 (Table I) and Aβ levels in culture media determined by ELISAs, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Media from transgenic, but not non-transgenic (data not shown), cortical cultures contained human Aβ; the levels of human Aβ in transgenic cultures were higher than the levels of endogenous mouse Aβ (Fig. 3). This provides in vitro evidence that neurons of NSE-APP transgenic mice can produce abundant amounts of human Aβ. In order to assess β-secretase activity in vivo, brain homogenates were assayed by Western analysis for the presence of β-s-APP. This approach was chosen for the following reasons. β-s-APP is a direct product of β-secretase activity, and its production parallels the production of Aβ in vitro under conditions that are expected to either directly modulate the activity of β-secretase or to modulate the accessibility of APP to β-secretase. The incorporation of the Swedish mutation into APP (7Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 8Cai X.-D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar)3 enhances both β-s-APP and Aβ production. Treatment of 293 cells with bafilomycin reduces both β-s-APP and Aβ production without any effect on α-secretase products (22Knops J. Suomensaari S. Lee M. McConlogue L. Seubert P. Sinha S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2419-2422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that levels of β-s-APP serve as a good marker for β-secretase activity. Previously, we described an antibody specific for β-s-APP that does not cross-react with α-s-APP or uncleaved APP (4Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Lieberburg I. Schenck D.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Because this antibody does not recognize the Swedish mutant form of β-s-APP, we have likewise generated a similar antibody specific for the Swedish mutant form of β-s-APP, Swedish192 (22Knops J. Suomensaari S. Lee M. McConlogue L. Seubert P. Sinha S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2419-2422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This antibody does not cross-react with the wild type version of β-s-APP, α-s-APP, nor with full-length APP produced by cells in culture (22Knops J. Suomensaari S. Lee M. McConlogue L. Seubert P. Sinha S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2419-2422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).3 For the present study, we determined that Swedish192 also does not cross-react with these molecules in brain homogenates of transgenic animals (data not shown). Brain homogenates, solubilized in either low salt or 2% Nonidet P-40, from mice of different transgenic lines were compared for β-s-APP content by Western blot analysis using the Swedish192 antibody (Fig. 4). β-s-APP was clearly detectable in 6/6 different NSE-APP expressor lines tested (Hillary lines 14 and 103, Chelsea lines 32, 58, 62, and 68). β-s-APP levels were roughly proportional to the levels of total APP produced in these lines (data not shown). There is still a debate concerning which cell type is responsible for the generation of Aβ in brain (39Wisniewski H.M. Wegiel J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 673: 84-270Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In vitro data indicate greater Aβ production in astroglial cultures than in neuronal cultures (3Busciglio J. Gabuzda D.H. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2092-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). We wished to address this question in an in vivo system. Our demonstration of the abundant presence of β-s-APP in NSE-APP transgenic animal brains demonstrates that neurons are capable of vigorous β-secretase activity and are a potential source of Aβ in the brain. Astrocytes are also an abundant cell type in brain, and we next asked if they too were capable of generating β-secretase products of APP in the GFAP-APP transgenic animals. Notably, GFAP-APP mice produce substantially less β-sAPP than NSE-APP mice (Fig. 5). While basal levels of human APP expression in the GFAP APP line 835-18 were slightly lower than those of the NSE-APP line Hillary 14, injury-induced astroglial activation resulted in an up-modulation of human APP expression in the GFAP-driven line to levels in excess of those seen in the NSE-APP transgenic mice (Fig. 5). Strikingly, compared with the NSE-APP line Hillary 14, relatively little β-s-APP was produced in GFAP-APP line 835-18 in either lesioned or unlesioned brains. Western analyses on Nonidet P-40 soluble extracts (Sup 2) with Swedish192 antibody again showed robust amounts of β-s-APP in NSE-APP animals and very little β-s-APP in GFAP-APP mice (data not shown), indicating that β-s-APP inside cells is likewise reduced in the GFAP-APP transgenic animals. The same results were obtained when NSE-APP line Chelsea 58 and GFAP-APP line 835-16 were compared and when NSE-APP line Chelsea 58 was crossed onto the same background mouse strain as the GFAP-APP lines (Fig. 6). While lesioning of either GFAP-APP or the NSE-APP transgenic mice had no effect on the ratio of β-s-APP to total APP, this ratio was substantially lower in GFAP-APP than in NSE-APP transgenic mice (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Although it is difficult to measure Aβ in brain homogenates of transgenic mice with these moderate levels of human APP expression, we were able to measure detectable levels (5-fold over background fluorescence) of Aβ in brain homogenates from NSE-APP but not GFAP-APP mice (Fig. 6). This supports our Western data and indicates that in vivo, β-S-APP measurements accurately reflect β-secretase activity and Aβ production. In conclusion, the demonstration of abundant β-s-APP generation and the production of Aβ in the central nervous system of NSE-APP transgenic mice indicates that neurons are capable of vigorous β-secretase activity and are a potentially important source of Aβ in the brain. While astrocytes are also an abundant cell type in the brain and respond to neural injuries with increased APP expression, based on the relatively low β-s-APP and undetectable Aβ production in lesioned and unlesioned GFAP-APP transgenic mice, β-secretase cleavage and Aβ production appears to be substantially less effective in astrocytes than in neurons. As illustrated here, the established APP transgenic mice can serve as convenient models to assess β-secretase activity in different central nervous system cell types in vivo. These mice should also prove valuable for the preclinical testing of β-secretase inhibitors, compounds that may be useful in the treatment of AD.

Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), implicating these four transmembrane helices in the formation of the Ca2+ binding and translocation domain. Sites of ATP binding and phosphorylation have been localized in cytoplasmic sequences of the molecule (10Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 11Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

In the Ca2+ transport cycle, a series of phosphoprotein intermediates are formed (13de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), which probably correspond to a series of transient conformations that occur in the molecule as Ca2+ transport proceeds. At least two phosphoprotein intermediates, E1P, a high energy intermediate (2Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and E2P, a low energy intermediate (5Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2767-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), can be stabilized in mutant enzymes. In the process of Ca2+ transport, conformational changes initiated in the cytoplasmic nucleotide binding and phosphorylation domains must be transmitted through long range interactions involving stalk sequences S4 and S5 (14MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), to the transmembrane Ca2+ binding domain, accounting for the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and the movement of Ca2+ ions (15MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 1355-1365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16MacLennan D.H. Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Skerjanc I.S. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 607: 141-150Google Scholar).In an effort to understand the structure-function relationships of amino acids that form the Ca2+ binding domain, we have continued the analysis of the effects of mutagenesis of all residues in transmembrane helices M4, M5, M6, and M8. In a previous study of M4, we found that a “patch” of residues surrounding the Ca2+-binding ligand, Glu309, was particularly sensitive to mutation (6Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Rice W.J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18359-18364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now extended our studies, finding that M5 and M6 each contain a “patch” of mutation-sensitive amino acids. A motif can be identified within this patch in M4 and M6, and elements of the motif can be observed in the mutation-sensitive patch in M5. By contrast, only a single residue in M8 was found to be mutation-sensitive. These observations, together with previously published results showing that mutation of Glu908 does not disrupt Ca2+ occlusion (17Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that M8 plays a far less significant structural or functional role than M4, M5, and M6 in the formation of the Ca2+ binding pore.DISCUSSIONRecent studies of the Ca2+-ATPase have focused on the precise role of the six residues proposed to make up the Ca2+ binding and transport sites in the Ca2+-ATPase (1Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 3Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Mutation of Glu309 to Gln was shown to result in the loss of only one of the two Ca2+ binding sites (28Skerjanc I.S. Toyofuku T. Richardson C. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15944-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which appear to be stacked on top of each other within the membrane (30Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of its accessibility, ligand Glu309 was proposed to be located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (28Skerjanc I.S. Toyofuku T. Richardson C. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15944-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further study of the affinity of each of the mutants for Ca2+ provided evidence that Glu309, Asn796, and Asp800 contribute to the more cytoplasmic of the two Ca2+ binding sites, while Glu771, Thr799, Asp800, and, possibly, Glu908 contribute to the more lumenal site (17Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19383-19387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ inhibition of E2P formation from Pi is less pronounced in the mutant N796A than in comparable mutations in the other five Ca2+-binding amino acids (1Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 9Chen L. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Zhong L. Stock C. Kirtley M.E. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10745-10752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These studies have cast some doubt on the role of Asn796 in Ca2+ binding (9Chen L. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Zhong L. Stock C. Kirtley M.E. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10745-10752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutations of Glu309, Glu771, Asn 796, Thr799, and Asp800 disrupted the ability of the mutant protein to occlude Ca2+, but mutation of Glu908 to Ala, which destroys Ca2+ transport, did not disrupt Ca2+ occlusion (17Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding raises serious concerns about the role of Glu908 in Ca2+ binding and translocation.Mutation-sensitive Amino Acids in M4, M5, and M6Analysis of the effects of mutation of all of the residues in M4 (6Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Rice W.J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18359-18364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), revealed that a “patch” of residues surrounding Glu309, the Ca2+-binding ligand located in transmembrane segment M4, are highly sensitive to mutation. In this study we have completed the map of mutation sensitivity of all residues in transmembrane sequences M5, M6, and M8. Fig. 2 provides a visual summary of the locations of the most deleterious of multiple mutations carried out on each of the amino acids making up transmembrane sequences M4, M5, M6, and M8. These data are expanded in Tables I, II, III, IV as a summary of the experimental data obtained through the analysis of all red or yellow mutations in Fig. 2. An examination of Fig. 2 reveals that the overall patterns resulting from mutagenesis are very similar for predicted helices M4, M5, and M6, but very different for M8.The mutation-sensitive residues are distributed rather uniformly among the first three helices, with 8 in M4, 11 in M5, and 8 in M6 (Fig. 2). These patches form similar arrays on the seven tiers of the α-helical net that is portrayed in Fig. 2. The patches of mutation-sensitive residues extend from tier 1 to tier 6, with their broadest points in tiers 3 and 4. At their broadest point, they would span about 240° of the 360° helix (PEG310 in M4; SSN768 in M5; TDG801 in M6), and in tiers 2 and 5 they span about 140° (AA305 in M4; YL764 in M5; NL797 in M6). With the exception of tiers 1-3 in M5, a contiguous column of relatively hydrophobic, mutation-insensitive residues runs down the right-hand side of the seven tiers of each of the three helical nets. This establishes a hydrophobic face in M4, M5, and M6 and indicates their orientation with respect to hydrophobic regions surrounding this cluster.The pattern of mutation-sensitive residues in the three different helices also highlights an interesting distribution of amino acid sizes. Of the 14 mutation-sensitive residues in tiers 3 and 4 of the helical nets for M4, M5, and M6, only Glu residues in M4 and M5 are bulky residues. Of the five mutation-sensitive residues in tiers 1 and 2, four are bulky residues. Of the eight mutation-sensitive residues in tiers 5 and 6, three are bulky (Table VI). This distribution, in part, reflects the distribution of large and small residues in the different tiers. Large and bulky residues account for 57% of the total residues in tiers 1 and 2 of the three helices; 9.5% of the total residues in tiers 3 and 4; and 43% of the total residues in tiers 5 and 6. The overall pattern is not uniform, since all seven residues in tiers 1 and 2 of M5 are bulky and all four residues in tier 6 of M6 are bulky. Nevertheless, the overall mass distribution would suggest that helices M4, M5, and M6 are slightly hour glass-shaped, with a higher concentration of small and polar residues in the central tiers and a higher concentration of bulky and nonpolar residues in the peripheral tiers. The lower mass density in the central tiers might create the space between ligands that is required for Ca2+ ion binding and, perhaps, for a few water molecules. They may also allow for mobility, relative to each other, of those helices that form the Ca2+ binding and translocation sites. Mutation sensitivity in the different tiers may result from fundamentally different principles. The small and polar core residues may be mutation-sensitive because of their direct involvement with Ca2+ binding and translocation. The larger, more hydrophobic, peripheral residues may be mutation-sensitive because of space constraints during conformational changes.Table VIStratification of mutation-sensitive and bulky residues in M4, M5, and M6TiersTotal residuesMutation-sensitive residuesBulky residuesNumberPercentageNumberPercentage%%1 and 22151812433 and 42114524145 and 6218309327900311 Open table in a new tab Mutation-sensitive MotifAn important point of similarity between M4 and M6 is the presence in tiers 3 and 4 of a six-residue motif that is highlighted by its mutation sensitivity. The motif begins with the Ca2+-binding amino acids Glu309 and Asp800 and continues as (E/D)GLPA(V/T). Although the sequence similarity does not extend beyond six residues, the similarity in mutation sensitivity actually begins four residues upstream. Thus, the sequences AAIP308 in M4 and NLVT799 in M6 each contain three residues in the same position that are mutation-sensitive, and the remaining residue is hydrophobic and mutation-insensitive in both sequences (see Fig. 2A). There is, however, little correspondence among the mutation classes found at each location. The structural and functional similarity between helices M4 and M6 suggests a possible sequence duplication during evolution. The positions of Glu908 and Ala912 in M8 are the only indication that M8 might also have evolved divergently from a duplication of the same sequence that gave rise to M4 and M6.Elements of the motif can be seen in M5, and these similarities are highlighted in Fig. 2B. The (reverse) sequence EGV769 corresponds to the first three amino acids in the M4/M6 motif, (E/D)G(L/V), and the pattern of mutation sensitivity is very similar (Fig. 2B). In the case of M5, convergent evolution may have created a counterpart of the M4/M6 motif but in the reverse orientation.In the region of the motif, the acidic residues at position 1 are clearly Ca2+-binding residues. Gly, with no side chain, when fitted into position 2, would create an open space on the cytoplasmic side of each of the Ca2+-binding ligands, perhaps providing room for rotation among helices or for binding of the Ca2+ ion. Leu at position 3 (and Ile or Val at position −2) may represent the faces of the helices that are in contact with lipid. Proline at position 4 might allow the helices to bend away from the Ca2+ entry point on the cytoplasmic surface, thus widening the pore. The function of Ala in position 5 or of the relatively isomorphic residues, Thr and Val, at position 6 is not clear.A search of the SWISS-PROT data bank revealed that the motif is conserved in other P-type ATPases (e.g. Na+/K+, EGLLAT; plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, EGLPLA; plasma membrane H+-ATPase (yeast), VGLPAV). An intriguing comparison can also be made with the cation-binding sequence in subunit C of the Escherichia coli H+ transporting ATPase. The sequence DAIP, in which Asp60 is the apparent site of H+ binding, was converted to a sequence that would bind Li+ by mutation of DAIP63 to AEST63, a sequence that imparts Na+ specificity to the comparable protein in Propionigenium modestum (31Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These results suggest that this sequence, which resembles the (E/D)GLPA(V/T) motif, is critically important in ion recognition, binding, and translocation in the F0 subunit C.Mutation-sensitive Residues in M5 and M6Transmembrane helix M5 contains a tier of three mutation-sensitive residues (SSN768) lying above the Ca2+-binding ligand Glu771. Mutations S766V and S767V resulted in a sharp decrease in apparent Ca2+ affinity. The mutations S766A and S767A also decreased Ca2+ affinity, but to a lesser degree. The mutation of S766C, allowing a better evaluation of the importance of the Ser hydroxyl group, decreased Ca2+ affinity by 1 order of magnitude, but the mutation S767C had little effect on function. Thus, the hydroxyl groups in these two Ser residues, unlike the hydroxyl group in Thr799 (3Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6262-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could be replaced without complete loss of Ca2+ transport function. On this basis, Ser766 and Ser767 are not defined as Ca2+-binding ligands. They may, however, form part of the lining of a polar channel for the passage of Ca2+ through the pump. In particular, the hydroxyl group of Ser766 may bind Ca2+ during the transport cycle, given its particular sensitivity to mutation. The mutation N768A decreased Ca2+ affinity by 0.8 pCa units, while replacement of Asn768 with the bulky, hydrophobic residue Ile resulted in loss of Ca2+ transport activity and a slow E2P dephosphorylation. Thus, Asn768 may also form part of the lining of a polar channel in the center of the protein.Two bulky, hydrophobic, mutation-sensitive residues lie in tiers 5 and 6 below the Ca2+-binding ligand Glu771 in M5. The mutations I775A and L777A led to loss of function. Since Ala is not a helix breaker, loss of function was most likely due to loss of bulk. This may indicate that Ile775 and Leu777 are “knobs” that must fit into “holes” on other helices during the Ca2+ transport cycle. Ile775 could be replaced with the slightly less bulky residue Val, indicating that an exact fit is not required in this position.Other residues of particular interest in M5 include the cluster of large, hydrophobic and aromatic residues in tiers 1 and 2 that are mutation-sensitive, Phe760, Tyr763, and Leu764. The mutation Y763G uncoupled Ca2+ transport from ATP hydrolysis (7Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 908-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is a drastic mutation, going from the largest to the smallest of residues, but the demonstration that this alteration allows Ca2+ to escape from its binding sites in the center of M4, M5, and M6 to the cytoplasmic surface strongly suggests that the presence of seven bulky residues out of seven at the top of M5 plays an important role in “capping” the Ca2+ pore. The mutation F760G or of L764G, however, did not affect coupling, but did affect Ca2+ affinity (7Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 908-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mutations F760A and F760L, like the mutation F760G, reduced Ca2+ affinity, suggesting that a large, aromatic side chain is also important at position 760. We found that the mutation Y763T sharply reduced Ca2+ transport, but we did not detect a block in the transport cycle, nor did we find any evidence for uncoupling of Ca2+ transport from ATP hydrolysis. The mutation Y763F had no functional consequences, indicating that the reduction in Ca2+ transport was due to the loss of the bulky aromatic ring and not to the loss of the Tyr hydroxyl group. Mutations L764A and L764S were also not significantly different from wild type Ca2+-ATPase. It is possible that the extreme reduction in Ca2+ affinity resulting from the mutation L764G, as well as the uncoupling of mutant Y763G, are due to the unique properties of Gly rather than to loss of bulk.As with M4 and M5, transmembrane helix M6 contains many residues sensitive to mutation. Unlike M4, M5, and M8, which contain only one Ca2+-binding ligand each, helix M6 contains three Ca2+-binding ligands (1Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 3Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6262-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, residues Gly801 and Pro803 are mutation-sensitive (2Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2767-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, two more residues, Leu797 and Ala804, have been shown to be critical to pump function. Replacement of Leu797 with Ala, Val, or Ile resulted in an approximately 3-fold reduction in apparent Ca2+ affinity. Given the similar total bulk of Leu and Ile, this indicates that Leu797 requires a near perfect fit in the wild type enzyme. Such stringent requirements were not observed for Ile775 and Leu777 in M5. Replacement of Ala804 with Val resulted in a block in E2P dephosphorylation, as well as a lower Ca2+ affinity, as determined by the Ca2+ dependence of phosphoenzyme formation. Mutation of Ala804 to Gly was tolerated, but mutation of Ala804 to Ser, a residue of similar size but greater polarity, was less deleterious than mutation to Val, which resulted in a significant decrease in apparent Ca2+ affinity. Ala804 in M6 resembled Ala305 and Ala306 in M4 in that mutation of any of these three to Val resulted in a block in E2P dephosphorylation. Accordingly, Ala804, as well as Ala304 and Ala305, may form hydrophobic holes in which larger residues from other helices can fit. With the results of this study, it is now clear that the E2P dephosphorylation block is not limited to M4, which is in closest contact to the phosphorylation site at Asp351, but is also a property of M5 and M6.Mutation-sensitive Amino Acids in M8While even conservative substitutions for many residues in M4, M5, and M6 resulted in conformational blocks, the only residue in M8 that was found to be mutation-sensitive was Glu908, previously proposed to be a Ca2+-binding ligand (1Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Mutations A900L and L901A did result in substantial decreases in Vmax, but these effects can be contrasted with the comparable mutations A305V and A306V in M4, I775A in M5, or A804V in M6, in which substitution of Ala with a slightly larger amino acid or substitution of a bulky hydrophobic residue with Ala led to a strong block in dephosphorylation of E2P and, consequently, to the transport-negative phenotype.The lack of sensitivity of M8 to mutation might suggest that it interacts with lipid over much of its surface. We deduced that an Ala residue that can tolerate replacement with the bulky residue Phe is probably facing lipid rather than other transmembrane helices. The mutation A900F resulted in an E1P to E2P block, while the mutation A912F resulted in a sharp decrease in apparent Ca2+ affinity. These results indicate that Ala900 and Ala912 probably face other transmembrane helices. We have not included these Ala to Phe mutations in the summary presented in Fig. 2A, since the effects of such serious alterations in size were not measured for any residues in the other three helices (with the exception of the mutation of Tyr763 to Gly, leading to an uncoupled mutant).In earlier studies (3Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6262-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we showed that replacement of Glu908 with Asp led to a transport-negative phenotype but that replacement with Gln had no effect on function. By contrast, substitution of the corresponding amidated residue for Glu309, Glu771, or Asp800 resulted in complete loss of Ca2+ transport function. We interpreted this to indicate that only one oxygen in Glu908 is directly involved in the formation of the Ca2+ binding site. Andersen and Vilsen (17Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) later showed that mutation E908A does not disrupt Ca2+ occlusion, suggesting that Glu908 may not actually provide an essential oxygen ligand. To test the possibility that bulk rather than an oxygen ligand might be critical, we substituted Glu908 with Met, another residue of similar size. The properties of the mutant E908M were typical of Ca2+-binding mutants, indicating that at least one oxygen ligand must be present in residue 908 to support Ca2+ transport. Although the results of mutagenesis have clearly distinguished M8 from M4, M5, and M6, it has not been possible to rule out the requirement of Glu908 for Ca2+ transport.The Ca2+ binding domain of SERCA1a binds two Ca2+ ions, and these bound ions appear to be “stacked” in a single channel (30Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data in this paper expand our knowledge of the size and complexity of the Ca2+ binding faces in M4, M5, and M6 and tend to exclude M8 as a participant in the formation of the Ca2+ binding sites. These data do not yet resolve the question of how the Ca2+ binding faces relate to each other. The residues forming these Ca2+ binding sites clearly reside in M4, M5, and M6, and there is reasonable evidence that Glu309, Glu771, Asn796, Thr799, Asp800, and perhaps Glu908 contribute different ligands to the two different Ca2+ binding sites (17Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19383-19387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Skerjanc I.S. Toyofuku T. Richardson C. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15944-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, these residues must face inwards. As a corollary, Fig. 2A shows a contiguous column of residues on the right-hand edge of the helical net for M4, M6, and part of M5 that locates the lipid binding “face” of these helices. The next step in analysis is to understand how these Ca2+ binding faces relate to each other. Site-directed disulfide mapping of amino acids located in the mutation-sensitive patches is being carried out in our laboratory in an effort to understand these relationships (32Rice W.J. MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A139Google Scholar). This approach, combined with high resolution analysis of three-dimensional structures (33Toyoshima C. Sasabe H. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1993; 362: 469-471Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar), should soon provide the appropriate structural information. INTRODUCTIONThe Ca2+-ATPase of fast twitch skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1a) 1The abbreviations used are: SERCA1aCa2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulumMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidE1PADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediateE2PADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate. binds 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein and transports 2 mol of Ca2+ from cytoplasmic to lumenal spaces for each mol of ATP hydrolyzed. In recent years, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to explore structure-function relationships in SERCA1a. Ca2+-ATPase mutants have been divided into several classes: Vmax mutants; Ca2+-binding mutants; apparent Ca2+ affinity mutants (possibly reflecting a shift in E1-E2 equilibrium); phosphorylation mutants; ATP-binding mutants; mutants blocked between E1P and E2P; mutants blocked in E2P dephosphorylation; and uncoupled mutants (1Clarke D.M.

In a previous study of M4, we found that a “patch” of residues surrounding the Ca2+-binding ligand, Glu309, was particularly sensitive to mutation (6Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Rice W.J. Andersen J.P.

We have now extended our studies, finding that M5 and M6 each contain a “patch” of mutation-sensitive amino acids. A motif can be identified within this patch in M4 and M6, and elements of the motif can be observed in the mutation-sensitive patch in M5. By contrast, only a single residue in M8 was found to be mutation-sensitive. These observations, together with previously published results showing that mutation of Glu908 does not disrupt Ca2+ occlusion (17Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that M8 plays a far less significant structural or functional role than M4, M5, and M6 in the formation of the Ca2+ binding pore."

Tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic tail is induced by adhesion to αvβ3-specific ligand or antibody or by incubation in manganese-containing buffer. Under the same conditions, β5 does not become tyrosine-phosphorylated in K562 transfected with αvβ5. Phosphorylation of the β3 subunit requires the simultaneous presence of the αv subunit cytoplasmic tail, because neither the αIIb subunit nor a truncated αv subunit is sufficient to permit phosphorylation of β3 when coexpressed as a heterodimer with β3. Finally, tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic tail occurs on both human and murine β3 and is inducible in the ovarian carcinoma OV10 as well, independent of expression of integrin-associated protein (CD47). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 integrin subunit facilitates association of Grb-2, an adaptor protein leading to activation of the Ras signaling pathway, and may contribute to the unique functional and signaling capabilities of αvβ3.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 integrin subunit facilitates association of Grb-2, an adaptor protein leading to activation of the Ras signaling pathway, and may contribute to the unique functional and signaling capabilities of αvβ3. One puzzling aspect of integrin biology is the apparent redundancy in ligand specificity of many integrins. For example, both αvβ3 and αvβ5 bind vitronectin (1Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). An hypothesis to resolve this overlap in ligand binding is that outside-in signaling differs when distinct integrins are ligated by a single extracellular matrix protein. β3 integrins may have a unique place in integrin biology because of the myriad functional and signaling capabilities that have been ascribed to them. β3 integrins mediate diverse functions such as clot retraction in platelets (2Chen Y.P.

One reason for the lag in mechanistic understanding of β3 integrin signaling has been the inability to define any inherent enzymatic activity within β3 itself or to find unique associated proteins with clear functional effects. Studies that have analyzed β3 domains required for signaling or function have identified the carboxyl-terminal portion of the β3 cytoplasmic tail (CT) 1The abbreviations used are: CTcytoplasmic tailEGFepidermal growth factormAbmonoclonal antibody(ies)IAPintegrin-associated proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPYtyrosinephosphorylated. as especially important for inside-out signaling, metastastis, and phagocytosis (10Zhou M.-J.

This region contains two tyrosine residues within NXXY sequences. Tyrosines within NXXY motifs in the insulin receptor, EGF receptor, and low density lipoprotein receptor have been shown to be phosphorylated and to be important in the assembly of tyrosine kinase signaling cascades (18Songyang Z.

Upon examination of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins contained in αvβ3 immunoprecipitations from αvβ3-transfected K562 cells incubated with Mn2+, we repeatedly found a single, prominent, 95-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. Direct amino acid sequencing identified this protein as the human β3 integrin subunit itself, a result confirmed by reprobing blots with mAb specific for β3. This is the first documentation of tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 subunit of the integrin αvβ3. Phosphorylation of the β3 subunit was enhanced when the cells were incubated in Mn2+ or when αvβ3 was occupied by immobilized ligand or mAb. Murine β3 was similarly tyrosine-phosphorylated when expressed as a chimeric integrin with human αv. Phosphorylation did not occur in αvβ5 in K562 cells nor in αvβ3 when the CT of β3 was truncated, indicating that phosphorylation likely occurs within the β3 CT. Surprisingly, β3 did not become tyrosine-phosphorylated when paired with either αIIb nor an αv subunit from which the CT had been deleted, indicating that the αv CT is required for β3 to become tyrosine-phosphorylated. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 CT is not unique to K562 cells nor their transforming agent because phosphorylation of β3 could also be induced in an ovarian carcinoma cell line overexpressing αvβ3. Grb-2, an SH2 containing adaptor protein that can initiate the Ras signaling pathway, co-immunoprecipitated with β3 under conditions in which β3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 integrins provides a potential mechanism to explain the unique functions of this integrin. The human erythroleukemic cell line K562 transfected with cDNA encoding various integrin subunits and mutated integrins were derived and maintained as described (1Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 21Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. LaFlamme S.E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, K562 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding full-length β3 and a truncated αv (KαvNTβ3). KαvNTβ3 were selected for high expressing uniform populations by fluorescent cell sorting flow cytometry as described (21Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. LaFlamme S.E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Expression of αvNTβ3 was equivalent to Kαvβ3 (21Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. LaFlamme S.E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) by flow cytometry using mAb to αv and β3. For construction of αvNT, the EaeI site overlapping NotI at the 3′ end of the αv cDNA in pCDM8-αv (22Loftus J.C. O'Toole T.E. Plow E.F. Glass A. Frelinger A.L. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) was removed by digestion with NotI, treatment with mung bean nuclease, and religation. A clone recovered (pIAP416) lacked the NotI site and in addition had an approximately 500-base pair deletion of the 3′-untranslated region of the αv cDNA. In this plasmid, the HaeII-EaeI fragment encoding the αv transmembrane and proximal cytoplasmic tail region was replaced by a HaeII-EaeI digest of a polymerase chain reaction product obtained with 3′ oligonucleotide GAGGTGGCCGGACCCGTTTAATTTAGCCCATCCTGT (EaeI and reverse complement of new stop codon underlined) and 5′ oligonucleotide CAGCC AGCGCCCATGCCTGTGCCTGTGTG (HaeII underlined) on a pIAP416 template. The resulting clone (pIAP417) was verified by DNA sequencing (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) and encodes αv truncated to MYRMG resulting in the loss of the cytoplasmic tail including the FFKR sequence. KαvMβ3 are K562 cells transfected with cDNA encoding full-length human αv (22Loftus J.C. O'Toole T.E. Plow E.F. Glass A. Frelinger A.L. Ginsberg M.H.

Ross, manuscript in preparation. in pREP9 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). High expressing uniform populations of KαvMβ3 equivalent in αv expression to Kαvβ3 were derived by flow cytometry exactly as described above using mAb IC12 against human αv. OV10 cells are an ovarian carcinoma cell line expressing αvβ5 but lacking IAP (CD47; Ref. 24Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). For the current studies, OV10 were transfected with β3 cDNA in the absence (β3/vector) or the presence (β3/IAP-2) of integrin-associated protein form 2 cDNA (25Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Plas D. Reynolds S. Peters M.G. Brown E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3419-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells express more αvβ3 than αvβ5 and approximately 20-fold more αvβ3 than untransfected OV10. All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Plasma protein purifications and monoclonal antibodies utilized in these studies were exactly as described previously (1Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 21Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. LaFlamme S.E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). K562 expressing transfected integrins were washed three times for 5 min in HBSS++ (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2.0 mM Na3VO4 with or without 2.0 mM MnCl2 as indicated and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mM iodoacetamide, 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 12 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.0 mM Na3VO4. In some studies, washed cells suspended in HBSS++ with 2.0 mM Na3VO4 were permitted to attach for 15 min to either protein- or mAb-coated tissue culture plastic as described (21Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. LaFlamme S.E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Following attachment, cells were lysed as described above. Lysates from 5 × 106 cells were precleared with gelatin-Sepharose for 1 h, and integrins were immunoprecipitated with the indicated mAb for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed six times in lysis buffer and subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE. In some studies, 5.O mM sodium fluoride or 10.0 mM phenyl-arsine-oxide was substituted for the 2.0 mM Na3VO4 with similar outcomes. For two-dimensional electrophoresis, immunoprecipitates were first subjected to focusing in tube gels exactly as described by the manufacturer (Hoeffer, San Francisco, CA) using a 4.5-6.5 pH gradient of titered ampholines. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were visualized by ECL as described (26Zhou M.J. Lublin D.M. Link D.C. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13553-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Equivalence of integrin immunoprecipitations was verified by reprobing of blots with integrin-specific mAb. For some studies, β3 immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of Grb-2 by Western blot using mAb 81 (Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY). A Coomassie-stained spot that aligned with a tyrosine-phosphorylated paired sample from two-dimensionally separated and electrotransferred αvβ3 immunoprecipitates was NH2-terminally sequenced directly from polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by Midwest Analytical Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Anti-phosphotyrosine blotting of αvβ3 immunoprecipitates from K562 expressing this integrin (Kαvβ3) revealed a 95-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated (PY) protein (Fig. 1A) whether αvβ3 was immunoprecipitated with mAb 7G2 (directed against β3, Fig. 1A) or mAb 3F12 (directed against αv, data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein was dramatically enhanced by incubating cells in a Mn2+-containing buffer immediately prior to lysis. The 95-kDa PY protein was not found in immunoprecipitates of HLA Class 1 nor in immunoprecipitates of α5β1 from Kαvβ3. Both of these cell surface antigens are more highly expressed than αvβ3 in Kαvβ3 (data not shown). Interestingly, the 95-kDa PY protein was absent from immunoprecipitations of αIIbβ3 from K562 expressing this integrin, no matter which integrin subunit was the antigen for the immunoprecipitating mAb. No tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in αvβ3 immunoprecipitates without the inclusion of either orthovanadate or fluoride as a phosphatase inhibitor. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis further resolved the 95-kDa PY protein into two spots by phosphotyrosine blotting, a predominant 95-kDa spot with apparent pI of 6.2 and a minor 95-kDa spot with pI 6.1 (Fig. 1B). Direct NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of the predominant, 95-kDa, 6.2 pI spot revealed a 16-amino acid exact match to the amino terminus of the human integrin β3 subunit. Probing two-dimensional blots of αvβ3 immunoprecipitates confirmed that both the major (pI 6.2) and minor (pI 6.1) tyrosine-phosphorylated spots were reactive with mAb against β3 (7G2, data not shown). Treatment of αvβ3 immunoprecipitates with alkaline phosphatase prior to two-dimensional electrophoresis and anti-β3 Western blotting collapsed the two spots into a single spot reactive with β3 mAb and migrating at an approximate pI of 6.3 (data not shown). Phosphatase treatment also eliminated all anti-phosphotyrosine reactive proteins in the αvβ3 immunoprecipitates. Thus, both the pI 6.1 and 6.2 spots contain tyrosine-phosphorylated β3. Densitometric analysis of two-dimensional anti-β3 Western blots of αvβ3 immunoprecipitates from Mn2+-incubated cells and parallel immunoprecipitates treated with alkaline phosphatase showed that >75% of β3 was found in the pI 6.2 spot and 23% was in the more acidic pI 6.1 spot. Following phosphatase treatment, >95% of β3 was in the pI 6.3 spot. This analysis suggests that the overwhelming majority of β3 in αvβ3 expressed in K562 cells treated with Mn2+ is tyrosine-phosphorylated. To elucidate the requirements for β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, we used phosphotyrosine blotting to examine immunoprecipitates from manganese-treated K562 expressing either αvβ5 or the β3 subunit in conjunction with αv, αIIb, or an αv subunit in which the cytoplasmic domain has been truncated as well as the β3-subunit lacking its CT and expressed as a heterodimer with αv (Fig. 2A). Despite equivalent expression of all transfected receptors and equivalent recovery by immunoprecipitation (data not shown and Ref. 21Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. LaFlamme S.E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation was only seen when an intact β3 subunit was present in a heterodimer with an intact αv subunit. These results demonstrate that despite high sequence homology, β3 and β5, which differ in their roles in migration, focal contact formation, and signaling, also differ in their ability to become tyrosine-phosphorylated. Failure of truncated β3 to be phosphorylated is strong evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the phosphorylation site is in the cytoplasmic tail, which contains two NXXY sequences. In the β5 CT, Tyr759 of β3 is a phenylalanine, suggesting that this tyrosine may be critical for the phosphorylation of β3. The minor pI 6.1 spot on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, which disappears with alkaline phosphatase treatment, further suggests that in some β3 molecules both tyrosines may be phosphorylated. Moreover, the requirement for an intact αv CT suggests that its role in tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 is an active one. It is possible that the αv subunit CT serves to direct a tyrosine kinase to the β3 subunit or alternatively that the αv subunit is needed to maintain β3 in a conformation necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation to occur. In either case, this function of αv is not subserved by αIIb in K562 cells. Murine β3, despite having a slightly smaller overall molecular mass, shares 100% amino acid identity with human β3 within the CT.2 Expression of murine β3 as a chimeric heterodimer with human αv in K562 (KαvMβ3) results in a fully functional receptor with properties identical to human β3 with respect to ligand binding (data not shown). Immunoprecipitates of αvMβ3 from Mn2+-treated KαvMβ3 using mAb 3F12 directed against human αv blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine revealed that murine β3 also was tyrosine-phosphorylated under these conditions (Fig. 2B). The faster migration of the phosphorylated protein on SDS-PAGE and its comigration with murine β3 confirms the identification of β3 as the 95-kDa phosphoprotein. To determine if phosphorylation of β3 was specific to the K562 cell background, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 in OV10 cells, an ovarian carcinoma cell line that is genetically deficient in IAP. Immunoprecipitation and subsequent phosphotyrosine blotting of αvβ3 from Mn2+-treated OV10 demonstrates that β3 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in these cells, indicating that this biochemical modification is not cell-specific (Fig. 2B). Additionally, the absence (β3/vector) or the presence (β3/IAP-2) of transfected IAP had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 in OV10 (Fig. 2B). Thus despite the ability of IAP to regulate many β3 integrin-mediated functions, it appears to play no role in regulating the Mn2+-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β3. We also have seen weak phosphorylation of the β3 subunit in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor differentiated human peripheral blood monocytes and in thrombin stimulated fresh human platelets (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet β3 has been demonstrated recently (27Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Brief incubation of Kαvβ3 in Mn2+ enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 (Fig. 1A). This enhancement depended on the concentration of exogenous Mn2+ with maximal phosphorylation seen at approximately 0.25 mM MnCl2 (data not shown). Exposure to Mn2+ has been reported to shift β3 integrins to their high affinity state; thus tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 may be related either to activation of the receptor or to the subsequent function of β3 integrins following activation (21Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. LaFlamme S.E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To further explore the regulation of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, we examined ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of Mn2+ in Kαvβ3 settled briefly on the αvβ3-specific substrate vitronectin or the specific mAb 7G2 (reactive against β3) or on the nonspecific substrate casein or nonspecific mAb W632 (anti-HLA). 5 × 106 Kαvβ3 were placed in protein-coated tissue culture dishes as described under “Experimental Procedures” and centrifuged for 15 min at 100 × g. Supernatants were removed and cells were harvested directly into lysis buffer for αvβ3 immunoprecipitation and subsequent phosphotyrosine blotting (Fig. 3A). Only adhesion to specific αvβ3 ligand or mAb induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β3. Phosphorylation of β3 induced by specific adhesion was approximately equivalent to phosphorylation induced by treatment with exogenous Mn2+. Inclusion of cytochalasin D at 4.0 μg/ml had no effect on the β3 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by attachment to specific substrate (data not shown). This suggests that cytoskeletal rearrangements induced by integrin ligation are not required for β3 tyrosine phosphorylation. To understand the functional significance of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, we analyzed αvβ3 immunoprecipitates for the presence of associated signaling molecules. As seen in Fig. 3B, upon exposure to Mn2+, the SH2-containing adapter protein Grb-2 became associated specifically with αvβ3 but not with αIIbβ3 nor αvNTβ3. This co-association parallels the conditions under which β3 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and suggests that Grb-2 is binding directly or indirectly to phosphorylated tyrosine residues within the NXXY motifs of the β3 cytoplasmic tail. Using synthetic peptides modelled from the EGF receptor, it has been demonstrated that the NPXY sequence, when the tyrosine residue is phosphorylated, can bind directly to Shc (18Songyang Z.

Gullick W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Shc is able to interact with the Grb2-Sos complex, which mediates nucleotide exchange on Ras, thus forming a hypothetical link to cytoskeletal regulation (18Songyang Z. Margolis B. Chaudhuri M. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14863-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Prigent S.A. Pillay T.S. Ravichandran K.S. Gullick W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22097-22100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the related adaptor protein IRS-1, which links insulin receptors with downstream signaling cascades through association with Grb2-Sos, has been shown to associate specifically with αvβ3 (17Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). IRS-1 binds to a tyrosine-phosphorylated NPXY sequence motif in the CT of the insulin receptor (28White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its mechanism of interaction with αvβ3 is unknown. Although interaction of Grb-2 with tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides modeled on β3 has been demonstrated (27Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), this is the first demonstration of Grb2 recruitment to tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 in cells. Recruitment of Grb-2 by tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 provides a potential mechanism for the initiation of Ras-dependent signaling, important for both cytoskeleton-dependent cell functions and nuclear signals. The CT of β3 contains two tyrosine residues, each within an NXXY motif. The sequence Asn-Pro-Xaa-Tyr (NPXY) is conserved among the cytoplasmic tails of all integrin β subunits, occurring at residue 744-747 in β3 (29O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In β1 integrins, tyrosine phosphorylation of this motif alters cellular adhesive phenotype and cytoskeletal dynamics (20Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The tyrosines within these two motifs represent the only potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites within the β3 CT. The NPXY motif also has been identified in the cytoplasmic sequences of several cell surface receptors, including the EGF and low density lipoprotein receptors (20Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 34Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling and NMR of peptides indicate that the NPXY motif forms a reverse turn conformation that may result in the presentation of recognition domains to cytosolic proteins (35Bansal A. Gierasch L.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 1195-1201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition to NPLY, β3 has a more distal tyrosine within an NITY sequence, residues 756-759. Two groups have made systematic investigations of the role of the NXXY sequences in β3 function. Using assays of cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and tumor metastasis (36Filardo E.J. Brooks P.C. Deming S.L. Damsky C. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) or adhesion, focal contact formation, receptor activation, and phagocytosis (29O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9550-9557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), both groups concluded that although the 744NPLY747 sequence was important, it was not clear that the tyrosine itself was required. Moreover, no essential role for the 756NITY759 was found. It is interesting that these studies were done by one group with αvβ3 and by the other with αIIbβ3, which are disparate in their ability to support tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 in K562. These previous studies fail to completely exclude a role for β3 CT tyrosine phosphorylation in the functions they examined. Deletion of the tyrosine-containing domains diminished or abolished receptor function, and single amino acid mutations of the tyrosine residues produced partially functional receptors. However, in the β3 CT, the two tyrosines are contained within highly homologous sequences, which are predicted to form the same tertiary structure and can serve as sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. Either site would also fit the criteria for Shc binding (18Songyang Z. Margolis B. Chaudhuri M. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14863-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Prigent S.A. Pillay T.S. Ravichandran K.S. Gullick W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22097-22100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As the only two tyrosines in the β3 CT, one or both must be responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 CT described here. A reasonable hypothesis based on the previous data and our own findings is that the two NXXY sequences in β3 have at least partially redundant roles in β3 function. Deletion of only one NXXY motif or substitution of only a single tyrosine would place the burden of activity on the second, perhaps less functionally efficient site, an interpretation consistent with the data from previous structure-function studies. Only deletion of both sites would abolish all receptor activity, a hypothesis consistent with but not definitively tested by the previous work. Perhaps both tyrosines can become phosphorylated in the β3 CT of αvβ3, with each one preferentially used for specific functions of the wild type receptor. Deletion of either tyrosine would affect some functions preferentially but incompletely because of the ability of both NXXY motifs to support phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions. It is likely that ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 CT is a highly regulated modification that is transient in nontransformed αvβ3-expressing cells. The large proportion and discrete regulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 in K562 combined with the specific association of Grb-2 accentuate the potential importance of this observation. It is possible that phosphorylation of one or both CT tyrosines allows for initiation of a signaling cascade, which accounts for some of the unique properties of αvβ3. Mutational analysis of αvβ3 function directed specifically at this hypothesis will elucidate the physiologic role of this biochemical modification.

TGF-β1 transcriptionally stimulated the expression of RARα, RARγ, and RXRα genes, but did not do so for RARβ, RXRβ, and RXRγ genes. We also observed that AP-1, a transcriptional factor, plays an important role in the signal pathway for expression of RARα, RARγ, and RXRα genes stimulated by TGF-β1 because stimulation of the expression of these genes in the cytokine-treated cells was markedly inhibited by a mixture of antisense c-fos and c-jun. A gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that TGF-β1 is able to increase, in a dose-dependent manner, the binding of nuclear proteins to direct repeat 5, a consensus sequence with high affinity for RAR-RXR heterodimers. The mobility shift assay, using specific antibody for each receptor, showed that direct repeat 5-binding proteins may be RAR and RXR isoforms. The stimulated binding to direct repeat 5 was inhibited strongly by H-7, an inhibitor of serine/threonine kinase, and by curcumin, an inhibitor of AP-1.

https://openalex.org/W2152446319,"We have previously reported that salicylate inhibits the inducible NO synthase (NOS 2) in cytokine-induced cardiac fibroblasts (Farivar, R. S., Chobanian, A. V., and Brecher, P. (1996) Circ. Res. 78, 759-768). To define further the mechanism of inhibition of NOS 2 by salicylate, we investigated NOS 2 mRNA induction by cytokines and determined the kinetics of inhibition by salicylate as compared to dexamethasone. Interferon-γ plus tumor necrosis factor-α induced NOS 2 mRNA synergistically in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Both dexamethasone and salicylate equally inhibited the induction of NOS 2 mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, both before and after cytokine induction. Salicylate also inhibited interferon-γ plus interleukin-1β-induced NOS 2 mRNA. After 24 h of cytokine stimulation, salicylate stopped the induction of NOS 2 mRNA, whereas dexamethasone delayed the accumulation of transcript. In half-life experiments of NOS 2 mRNA, we found that dexamethasone reduced the half-life of NOS 2 mRNA from 7 to 4 h, whereas salicylate had no effect on mRNA stability. Tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ induced NF-κB (p50/p65) and STAT-1, respectively, as assessed by gel shift assays. Salicylate did not inhibit the cytokine induction of NF-κB or STAT-1. This study suggests that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of salicylate involves inhibition of NOS 2 transcription and shows that the effect is independent of NF-κB activation."

The cytochrome was found to consist of two domains made mostly of β sheet in an elongate (approximately 75 × 35 × 25 Å) geometry. The covalently bound heme lies within the larger domain of the elongate structure near the interface between the large and small domains, its heme iron atom 45 Å from the Arg250 near the COOH terminus that is connected to the single trans-membrane α-helix. The elongate structure of cytochrome f raises questions that are defined in a structural context about the pathway of electron transfer from the membrane-bound hydrogen donor, plastoquinol, to the Rieske protein, and from the Rieske protein to cytochrome f, whose heme appears to be far from the membrane surface. In addition, the existence of a buried ordered linear H2O chain, a seeming proton wire with virtually all H-bond donors and acceptors conserved in evolution, which extends 11 Å from the NΔ1 nitrogen of His25 toward Lys66 of the prominent basic surface region of cytochrome f, suggests that cytochrome f may be the exit port for protons translocated by the b6f complex (5Martinez S.E. Huang D. Ponomarev M. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Structures of the other protein subunits of the complex are needed to resolve these questions about the pathways of electron transfer and proton translocation.

A reddish brown band in the middle of the gradient was collected. The final buffer of the cytochrome b6f fraction was changed to 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100. Limited proteolysis of the complex was performed with thermolysin (1:100 w/w complex:protease for 3 h at room temperature), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The protein was then loaded on a hydroxylapatite column (2.5 × 5 cm) and equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2.

Approximately 5 nmol of the Rieske fragment was diluted in 0.1 ml of acetonitrile/H2O. 5 μl were directly injected into a flow stream of 5 μl/ml in a Micromass II Electrospray Ionization Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer at the Nebraska Center for Mass Spectrometry. Thirteen 6-s scans were combined, and a signal equal to 8-10 times the baseline noise was obtained. The visible spectrum and chemical difference spectra of the Rieske fragment, at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, in 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM buffer, consisting of 10 mM each of MES, MOPS, EPPS, CHES, and CAPS, were measured with a Cary 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer using a bandwidth at half-height of 2.0 nm. Potentiometric titrations were carried out using a homemade platinum-Ag/AgCl combination redox electrode with 0.4 mM ferricyanide as a redox buffer as described in Ref. 5Martinez S.E. Huang D. Ponomarev M. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar in a buffer medium of constant composition and ionic strength, as a function of pH, by titrating the amplitude of the short wavelength peak minus trough difference (394 and 408 nm, respectively) in the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum. The possible spectral interference caused by the presence of ferricyanide (absorbance maximum, 420 nm, ϵmM = 1) was eliminated by using a reference cuvette that contained the same concentration of all reagents except the protein and to which equal additions of reductant (sodium ascorbate) or oxidant were made. EPR spectra of the reduced iron-sulfur cluster of the Rieske fragment and cytochrome b6f complex were obtained using a Bruker ESP300 E spectrometer operating at X-band. The sample temperature was controlled with an Oxford Instrument helium flow cryostat. Spin quantitation was conducted under nonsaturating conditions using 0.5 mM CuEDTA as a standard. The instrument parameters were: microwave frequency, 9.25 GHz; power, 1 or 5 mW; modulation amplitude, 1.25 millitesla; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; time constant, 32 ms; sample temperature, 20 K. For measurement of spectra, the b6f complex (36 μM cyt f) and Rieske fragment (68 μM, 1 mg/ml) were poised anaerobically at pH 6.9 to a redox potential of +217 and +205 mV, respectively. Potentiometric redox titrations monitored by EPR were performed anaerobically in 20 mM buffer at the appropriate pH according to Ref. 12Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were 36 μM cytochrome f in the b6f complex, equivalent to approximately 4.0 mg/ml of monomeric complex, and 68 μM (1 mg/ml) Rieske fragment. The redox mediators were (Em7 values in parentheses): 25 μM duroquinone (5 mV), 8 μM phenazine methosulfate (80 mV), 50 μM 1,4-naphthoquinone-2-sulfonate (110 mV), 50 μM 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate (+210 mV), 10 μM N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (+260 mV), and 50 μM 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (+340 mV). Samples were frozen in a mixture of cold isopentane/methylcyclohexane (−140°C). The ordinate of the graphs describing the redox titrations corresponds to the normalized amplitude of the gy = 1.90 (trough to baseline) EPR signal. Protein concentrations were routinely determined by the Bradford method (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard, which was found to yield the same concentrations as obtained by nitrogen determination (14Jaenicke L. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 61: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The iron content was determined chemically according to Brumby and Massey (15Brumby P.E. Massey V. Methods Enzymol. 1965; 10: 463-474Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Rieske protein (10 μl containing 6.85 nmol of protein) was pipetted into an Eppendorf tube, 1 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g (5 min). 0.4 ml of the supernatant or standard iron solution (1-500 μM ferrous sulfate) was pipetted into glass tubes with 0.4 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid as the sample blank. Distilled water (0.36 ml), 0.15 ml of 1,10-phenanthroline (0.1%, w/v), 0.05 ml of 0.06 M ascorbic acid (sodium salt), and 0.04 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate were added, mixed, and reacted for 15 min, and the absorbance at 510 nm was recorded relative to the blank. The plastoquinone content of the purified Rieske protein fragment was determined spectroscopically, after hexane extraction, evaporation, resuspension in ethanol, and measurement of the spectrum between 200 and 350 nm using purified plastoquinone supplied by F. L. Crane and R. Barr as a reference and an extinction coefficient at 259 nm of 15 mM−1 cm−1 (16Barr R. Henninger M.D. Crane F.L. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1967; 42: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions for crystallization were initially selected using the sparse matrix approach in a commercial (Hampton) crystallization screen. The Rieske fragment was crystallized in hanging drops by vapor diffusion against 100 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM NH4-acetate, 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, pH 5.6-5.9, 20°C. The hanging drops contained approximately 10 mg/ml protein, and crystals appeared in about 4 days. The crystals were prepared for cryocrystallography by transferring them to a solution containing 100 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM, pH 5.8, NH4-acetate, 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 20% ethylene glycol for 1 min, followed by flash-freezing in a nitrogen stream at 110 K. Data were collected on a Rigaku R-axis II area detector diffractometer using CuKα radiation. A major (139-residue) COOH-terminal polypeptide fragment of the chloroplast Rieske was isolated and purified by a procedure similar to that used previously to purify a 129-residue fragment from the bovine mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex (11Link T.A. Hagen W.R. Pierik A.J. Assmann C. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The procedure involved limited thermolysis of the b6f complex isolated from spinach chloroplasts according to Ref. 7Huang D. Everly R.M. Cheng R.H. Heymann J.B. Schägger H. Sled V. Ohnishi T. Baker T.S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar and two subsequent chromatography steps utilizing hydroxylapatite and Sephadex G-75. The hydroxylapatite step results in the major purification, removing essentially all of the hydrophobic material including the cytochrome b6 and subunit IV polypeptides. It results in a fraction in which the Rieske fragment is the dominant component, with some higher molecular weight material that could be the soluble lumen side domain of cytochrome f (4Martinez S.E. Huang D. Szczepaniak A. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The purity of the COOH-terminal Rieske fragment is shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and a unique amino-terminal sequence (NH2-Phe-Val-Pro-Pro-Gly-Gly) obtained of the fragment (Table I). The latter sequence is identical to that of residues 41-46 of the Rieske protein from spinach chloroplasts (17Steppuhn J. Rother C. Hermans J. Jansen T. Salnikow J. Hauska G. Herrmann R.G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1987; 210: 171-177Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The similarity of the purification procedures used to isolate the Rieske protein fragment from the bc1 and b6f complexes is somewhat surprising, considering: (i) the subunit composition of the bc1 and b6f complexes, and the amino acid sequences of the other subunits, cytochromes f and c1, which also have a large peripheral domain that could be solubilized by proteases, are very different (4Martinez S.E. Huang D. Szczepaniak A. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 18Furbacher P.N. Tae G.-S. Cramer W.A. Baltscheffsky H. Origin and Evolution of Biological Energy Conversion. VCH Publishers, New York1996: 221-253Google Scholar); (ii) only nine of the first 65 residues of the soluble chloroplast Rieske protein fragment are identical to the mitochondrial Rieske fragment (19Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10475) Google Scholar) (Table I). Part of the explanation for the similarity of the purification protocols is that the hydroxylapatite column is apparently able to adsorb the hydrophobic subunits or subunit fragments, which accounts for most of the material in both cytochrome complexes.Table ISequence of the proteolytic Rieske protein fragment from the chloroplast cytochrome b6f complex (A) and the bovine mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex (B)1 37||A (b6f Rieske) : FVPPGGGAGT GGTIAKDALG NDVIAAEWLK THA—PGDRB (bc1 Rieske) : ———- ———- –VLAMSKIE IKLSDIPEGK38 59||A (b6f Rieske) : TLTQGLKGDP TYL——- —–VVES- —DK–TLAB (bc1 Rieske) : NMAFKWRGKP LFVRHRTKKE IDQEAAVEVS QLRDPQHDLE60 92||A (b6f Rieske) : TFG——I NAVCTHLGCV VPFNAAEN-K FICPCHGSQYB (bc1 Rieske) : RVKKPEWVIL IGVCTHLGCV PIANAGDFGG YYCPCHGSHY93 132||A (b6f Rieske) : NNQGRVVRGP APLSLALAHC DVDDGKVVFV PWTETDFRTGB (bc1 Rieske) : DASGRIRKGP APLNLEVPSY EFTSDDMVIV G———139|A (b6f Rieske) : EAPWWSAB (bc1 Rieske) : ——- Open table in a new tab The purity of the COOH-terminal end of the fragment, the homogeneity of the fragment, and a confirmation of an unmodified polypeptide chain were obtained from the spectrum of the molecular mass. The reconstructed electrospray ionization spectrum shows the dominant mass component to have a molecular weight of 14,620 ± 2, close to the value of 14,622 predicted from the primary sequence (data not shown). Peaks at mass values of 14,642 and 14,662 are probably sodium adducts, and there are distant small peaks at 14,374 and 14,767, which are ∼2-3% of the total sample mass, whose exact nature is not known. The difference between the primary sequences of the chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences is illustrated by (i) the shorter 129-residue fragment of the latter having a molecular weight, 14,419 (21Link T.A. Saynovits M. Assmann C. Iwata S. Ohnishi T. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which is close to that of the chloroplast Rieske fragment, although the bc1 Rieske fragment is 10 residues shorter; (ii) the predicted pI values are quite different, 5.61; and 7.45, respectively, for the b6f and bc1 Rieske fragments. The visible spectrum of the oxidized (Fig. 2A, trace a) and reduced (Fig. 2A, trace b) Rieske fragment is characterized by peaks centered at 406 and 400 nm at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2A, traces a and b). The reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum (Fig. 2B) has a short wavelength peak and trough at 394 and 409 nm, and a differential peak minus trough extinction coefficient, ΔϵmM = 3.8 mM−1 cm−1. The change of amplitude of the difference spectrum as a function of oxidation state (Fig. 3A) was used to titrate the Em. The titration at pH 7 is characterized by a Nernstian plot with n = 1.2 ± 0.1 and an Em7 of 320 mV (Fig. 3B), which is similar to the Em7 = +306 mV measured for the Rieske protein fragment from the bc1 complex of bovine mitochondria (21Link T.A. Saynovits M. Assmann C. Iwata S. Ohnishi T. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The titrations at the eight pH values used for the graph of the pH dependence shown in Fig. 3C contain an average of 13 data points, and fit Nernst plots with an n value close to 1 (1.09 ± 0.1). The asymptotes of the plots were well defined in both the low and high potential region relative to the Em (Fig. 3B). The reversibility of the titration was checked in the pH 7 titration (Fig. 3B) by sequential addition of ascorbate and ferricyanide. When the Em was measured as a function of pH in order to gain information on amino acid groups that could function in redox-dependent proton translocation, it was found that the Em increased to +359 ± 7 mV at pH values below 6.5 with an effective pK of 6.5 ± 0.2 (Fig. 3C). The limiting Em at low pH was approximately 50 mV more positive, and the pK was more acidic, than the corresponding Em at low pH of +311 mV and pK values of 7.6 and 9.2, measured for the mitochondrial Rieske fragment (11Link T.A. Hagen W.R. Pierik A.J. Assmann C. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At pH values ≥7.75, the chloroplast Rieske protein became unstable, as judged by loss of amplitude of the optical spectrum (data not shown).Fig. 3A, titration of the visible difference spectrum of the Rieske protein fragment as a function of ambient potential at pH 7.0; spectra a-i correspond to ambient potentials of 397, 390, 350, 339, 328, 314, 293, 273, and 265 mV.

The low amplitude of the gx signal in the Rieske protein from the b6f complex implies a small content of bound plastoquinone (26Ding H. Robertson D.E. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3144-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of plastoquinone to Rieske protein determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” was found to be negligible (<2%).

This single copy gene is expressed in pituitary gonadotropes and thyrotropes of all mammals and in placental trophoblasts of primates and horses. Tandem cAMP response elements (CREs) in the promoter of the human gene are key mediators of this pattern of cell-specific expression. Replacing the palindromic CREs with non-primate variant CREs significantly attenuated activity in trophoblasts but not in gonadotropes. Furthermore, proteins binding the palindromic CRE cross-reacted with antibodies for CREB, CREM, ATF1, ATF2, and c-Jun, while proteins binding the variant CRE cross-reacted only with ATF2 and c-Jun antibodies. The data suggest that ATF2 and c-Jun can activate transcription through the CREs in gonadotropes but not in trophoblasts. Additional analyses indicated that while promoters with either palindromic or variant CREs have similar overall activity in gonadotropes, the variant CREs make a much smaller contribution to promoter activity than their palindromic counterparts. The weaker contribution of the variant CREs is compensated by the activity of two upstream elements present in the promoter. This compensation probably occurs through an indirect mechanism, as the binding affinity of proteins to the CRE is not influenced by the presence of these upstream elements.

INTRODUCTIONThe glycoprotein hormones luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and chorionic gonadotropin (CG) are essential regulators of a variety of biological processes such as reproduction (LH and FSH), growth and metabolism (TSH), and maintenance of pregnancy (CG). Each consists of a common α subunit and a unique β subunit that confers hormone specificity (1Pierce J. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar). In all species, FSH, LH, and TSH are synthesized in the anterior pituitary, while only primates synthesize CG in the placenta (2Fiddes J.C. Goddman H.M. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1981; 1: 3-18PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chin, W. W., Imura, H., (ed) (1984) The Pituitary Gland, pp. 103–125, Raven Press, New York.Google Scholar, 4Moore, W. T., Burleigh, B. D., Ward, D.

A fifth glycoprotein hormone, pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, is produced in the placenta of horses. Synthesis of the complete spectrum of glycoprotein hormones requires accurate expression of the single α subunit gene in gonadotropes (LH and FSH) and thyrotropes (TSH) of the pituitary as well as the trophoblasts of the placenta in primates and horses.Analysis of transcriptional elements regulating expression of the human α subunit gene in trophoblast cell lines (BeWo or JEG3) revealed the presence of a composite enhancer located within the first 180 base pairs (bp) 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)CREcAMP response elementsGSEgonadotrope-specific elementPGBEpituitary glycoprotein hormone basal elementαBE αbasal elementPCRpolymerase chain reactionNRSnonimmune rabbit serumEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay. of the promoter (5Delegeane A.M.

This enhancer confers trophoblast-specific expression and consists of an upstream regulatory element (URE) located between positions −180 and −146 and two juxtaposed cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) located between positions −145 and −111 (Fig. 1A). Additional elements required for optimal expression in trophoblasts include the junctional response element and the CCAAT box (13Andersen B. Kennedy G.C. Nilson J.H. J. Biol.

These include the CREs, a specific sub-region in the URE, as well as the gonadotrope-specific element (GSE), the pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element (PGBE), and the α basal element (αBE, Fig. 1B) (15Schoderbek W.E.

In contrast, the GSE acts independently of other promoter elements.Although no single element is sufficient for targeting expression of the α subunit gene to trophoblasts or gonadotropes, the CREs, which contain the conserved palindromic sequence TGACGTCA, provide the strongest contribution to transcription in both cell types (11Silver B.J.

Cross-species comparison of promoter sequences revealed that non-primates contain one variant CRE with a single nucleotide difference in the core of the CRE palindrome (TGACGTCA to TGATGTCA) (22Fenstermaker R.A.

This disclosed a correlation between the presence of the variant CRE (TGATGTCA) and the inability to express this gene in trophoblasts. The correlation was further substantiated by the observation that changing the variant CRE of the bovine promoter to the palindromic sequence reconstituted activity of this element in a trophoblast cell line (7Bokar J.A. Keri R.A. Farmerie T.A. Fenstermaker R.A. Andersen B. Hamernik D.L. Yun J. Wagner T. Nilson J.H. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we describe the proteins binding the CREs in both cell types and use the non-primate variant CRE as a probe for exploring their functional significance when studied in the context of the human α subunit promoter.DISCUSSIONThe CREs play a major role in cell-specific regulation of the human α subunit promoter in both trophoblasts and gonadotropes. In trophoblasts, mutation or deletion of the CREs results in a dramatic loss in promoter activity (5Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, proteins binding a second element, the URE, cannot activate transcription in the absence of CRE binding proteins (5Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1988; 263: 9879-9886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, the URE and CRE define a composite enhancer sufficient for imparting trophoblast-specific activity to the α subunit promoter. In gonadotropes, mutation of the CREs also has a significant effect on promoter activity. However, instead of the URE, two elements further upstream, PGBE and αBE, act with the CREs to define another composite element that appears responsible for most of the activity of the α subunit promoter in gonadotropes (17Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).In this report, we establish yet another significant difference in how the CREs contribute to activity of the α subunit promoter in trophoblasts and gonadotropes. By exchanging the palindromic CREs of the human α subunit promoter with a species variant of the element, we demonstrated that the sequence requirements for this element are different between the two cell types, an observation supported by a number of earlier findings (7Bokar J.A. Keri R.A. Farmerie T.A. Fenstermaker R.A. Andersen B. Hamernik D.L. Yun J. Wagner T. Nilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5113-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Schoderbek W.E.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Together, these reports support the conclusion that the variant CRE is compatible with expression of the α subunit gene in gonadotropes but not in trophoblasts.Earlier studies using DNase footprinting or EMSA disclosed that the α subunit CREs are occupied by proteins in both trophoblasts and gonadotropes, but the proteins were not identified (8Jameson J.L. Powers A.C. Gallagher G.D. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell.

Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that purified CREB binds to the human α subunit promoter and, with much lower affinity, to the mouse and equine α subunit promoters. Additional studies suggested that heterodimers of CREB might be involved in activation of the variant CRE in GH3 cells (26Drust D.S. Troccoli N.M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our studies are the first to clearly identify proteins from cell lines derived from both trophoblasts and gonadotropes that bind the CREs of the α subunit promoter.The palindromic CRE binds proteins that cross-react with antibodies generated against several members of the bZIP family, including CREB, CREM, ATF1, ATF2, and c-Jun. This indicates that the proteins binding the human α subunit CRE are either similar or identical to these transcription factors that form both homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes. CREBCREB, CREBCREM, CREMCREM, CREBATF1, and ATF2c-Jun dimers are all known to bind to palindromic CREs (28Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). The precise roles for each of these proteins in the activation and/or regulation of the α subunit gene are not yet known, but the ability to bind so many members of the CREB/ATF family implicates the CRE as a potential target for multiple signaling pathways in the regulation of this gene.The variant CRE binds the same proteins as the palindromic CRE but with lower affinity. In fact, under standard gel shift conditions, the non-palindromic CRE binds predominantly ATF2 and c-Jun. Interestingly, these two bZIP proteins were previously shown to bind to a similar response element, jun1, on the c-Jun promoter (TGACATCA) (31Van Dam H. Wilhilm D. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). ATF2 and c-Jun have approximately two to five times lower affinity for the variant CRE than they have for the palindromic CRE. While CREB, CREM, and ATF1 also bind the variant CRE, they do so with approximately a 200-fold lower affinity, making it unlikely that these proteins are important for promoter function in the presence of the variant CREs. Consequently, our data suggest that ATF2 and c-Jun are the principal bZIP proteins that contribute to activity of α subunit promoter with a variant CRE in gonadotropes. Significantly, our data also establish that even though ATF2 and c-Jun are able to bind the variant CRE, this complex is unable to interact productively with the α subunit promoter in trophoblasts.One plausible explanation for the cell-specific difference between the palindromic and variant CRE is that concentrations of ATF2 and c-Jun in trophoblasts are inadequate to generate the appropriate complexes on the α subunit promoter. In this regard, the main difference between the CRE binding proteins in αT3 and BeWo cells is the distribution of the proteins in Bands 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). In BeWo cells, Band 2, which is comprised of complexes containing ATF2 and c-Jun, was noticeably less intense than in αT3 cells, suggesting that trophoblasts contain lower concentrations of these proteins. In addition, the variant CRE binds ATF2 and c-Jun with lower affinity than the palindromic CRE. These two factors likely result in a variant CRE that is unoccupied in trophoblasts. An α subunit promoter containing the variant CRE would be inactive in these cells. Of course, it is also possible that ATF2 and c-Jun bind sufficiently to the variant CREs but fail to interact with other essential transcription factors in trophoblasts. Clearly, further studies are needed to distinguish between these possibilities.In gonadotropes, the presence of the variant CRE does not impact negatively on activity of the α subunit promoter nor markedly alter the transcriptional mechanism. For example, activities of α subunit promoters with either a palindromic or variant CRE are nearly identical (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the same upstream elements, PGBE, αBE, and GSE, are required for full promoter activity regardless of which CRE is present (Fig. 6). However, the degree to which promoter activity depends on the upstream elements differs between the variant and palindromic CREs. In an earlier study (17Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we showed through pairwise mutational analysis that the PGBE and αBE acted synergistically with each other to contribute to promoter activity. We also noted that PGBE/αBE interacted with the tandem CREs. However, in this case the elements appeared to partially compensate for one another. Consistent with this finding, we now show that in the presence of the “weaker” variant CRE, mutations in PGBE and αBE had a four to five times greater impact on promoter activity than when the mutations were linked to the palindromic CRE. Thus, in the presence of a “weaker” CRE, more transcriptional demand is placed on the PGBE/αBE. Significantly, this interaction between PGBE/αBE and the CREs is specific for this particular combination as the GSE had the same relative contribution to promoter activity in the presence of either CRE. The ability of the GSE binding proteins to activate independently from the CRE binding proteins was noted earlier as well (17Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, it is apparent from these studies that the proteins binding the upstream elements and the CREs can influence each other's activity. However, in the presence of the variant CRE, it is unclear if the influence of the upstream elements is greater because different proteins bind the variant CRE or because this CRE has a lower affinity for the proteins.A mechanism by which PGBE/αBE might influence the CREs is by stabilizing or enhancing the binding of transcription factors to this element. By adding different competitor DNA fragments that contain the CRE as well as the wild type or mutant upstream elements, we were able to determine that PGBE and αBE do not influence the ability of these DNA fragments to bind CRE binding proteins. Since binding is not influenced, the ability of the upstream elements to compensate for the weakened variant CRE suggests that a common mechanism or pathway is used in activating transcription among the proteins binding PGBE, αBE, and the CREs. Such a mechanism may involve the use of a common co-activator or member of the basal transcription apparatus.In conclusion, the CREs, by interacting with different upstream elements, help to assure expression of the α subunit gene in two distinct cells types. Functional studies with the palindromic and variant CRE revealed a difference in the sequence requirements of the element in trophoblasts and gonadotropes. This suggested that interactions between the URE binding proteins and homo- or heterodimers containing CREM, CREB, and ATF1 are important for trophoblast-specific expression, while, at least in non-primates, interactions between PGBE/αBE binding proteins and Jun and ATF2 are important for gonadotrope-specific expression. Our goal now is to establish the relationship between the CRE binding proteins and the proteins binding the upstream elements. INTRODUCTIONThe glycoprotein hormones luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and chorionic gonadotropin (CG) are essential regulators of a variety of biological processes such as reproduction (LH and FSH), growth and metabolism (TSH), and maintenance of pregnancy (CG). Each consists of a common α subunit and a unique β subunit that confers hormone specificity (1Pierce J. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar). In all species, FSH, LH, and TSH are synthesized in the anterior pituitary, while only primates synthesize CG in the placenta (2Fiddes J.C. Goddman H.M. J. Mol. Appl.

A fifth glycoprotein hormone, pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, is produced in the placenta of horses. Synthesis of the complete spectrum of glycoprotein hormones requires accurate expression of the single α subunit gene in gonadotropes (LH and FSH) and thyrotropes (TSH) of the pituitary as well as the trophoblasts of the placenta in primates and horses.Analysis of transcriptional elements regulating expression of the human α subunit gene in trophoblast cell lines (BeWo or JEG3) revealed the presence of a composite enhancer located within the first 180 base pairs (bp) 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)CREcAMP response elementsGSEgonadotrope-specific elementPGBEpituitary glycoprotein hormone basal elementαBE αbasal elementPCRpolymerase chain reactionNRSnonimmune rabbit serumEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay. of the promoter (5Delegeane A.M.

This enhancer confers trophoblast-specific expression and consists of an upstream regulatory element (URE) located between positions −180 and −146 and two juxtaposed cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) located between positions −145 and −111 (Fig. 1A). Additional elements required for optimal expression in trophoblasts include the junctional response element and the CCAAT box (13Andersen B. Kennedy G.C. Nilson J.H. J. Biol.

These include the CREs, a specific sub-region in the URE, as well as the gonadotrope-specific element (GSE), the pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element (PGBE), and the α basal element (αBE, Fig. 1B) (15Schoderbek W.E.

The identification of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase as a multisubunit enzyme (1Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggests that it may be possible to link specific properties of the enzyme to specific protein subunits.Previous studies have shown partially purified rat liver GlcNAc-phosphotransferase phosphorylates lysosomal enzymes at least 500-fold better than non-lysosomal glycoproteins with similar high mannose oligosaccharides (2Lang L. Reitman M. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated high mannose oligosaccharides were poor substrates, as were heat-denatured lysosomal enzymes (2Lang L. Reitman M. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have resulted in a model that proposes that GlcNAc-phosphotransferase recognizes a conformationally sensitive protein determinant found on lysosomal enzymes. The structure of this determinant in the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D has been characterized (3Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S.

GlcNAc-phosphotransferase partially purified from the soil amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii is also selective for a protein determinant on lysosomal enzymes (6Ketcham C.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11654-11659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this paper, we have investigated the enzymatic properties and kinetics of GlcNAc phosphate transfer to lysosomal and non-lysosomal glycoproteins by a homogeneous preparation of bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. Our results demonstrate that bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase selectively phosphorylates lysosomal enzymes. That this selectivity, a property previously observed with impure preparations, is also found with isolated GlcNAc-phosphotransferase demonstrates that it is a property of the enzyme itself and not an accessory factor. We also demonstrate, using photoaffinity labeling with 5-N3-[β-32P]UDP-Glc, that the 166-kDa subunit contains the nucleotide sugar-binding site.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsScintiverse BD was from Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA). ConA-Sepharose and HiTrap NHS-activated columns were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Ribonuclease B and α-methylmannoside were obtained from Sigma. Porcine uteroferrin was the kind gift of Dr. R. Michael Roberts (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO). All other reagents were reagent grade or better and were from standard suppliers.MethodsPreparation of GlcNAc-phosphotransferaseMost of the experiments described were performed with GlcNAc-phosphotransferase that had been purified on PT18-3M-Emphaze according to Method II (1Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In some cases, the purified enzyme was further concentrated by chromatography on Mono Q. All these preparations had a specific activity of 10-12 μmol/mg/h and were homogeneous when examined on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The photoaffinity labeling experiments were performed with GlcNAc-phosphotransferase purified according to Method I (1Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This preparation had a specific activity of 200 nmol/mg/h and was heterogeneous on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Large-scale Preparation of the Enzymatic ProductUDP-GlcNAc (75 nmol) was incubated with 15 μmol of α-methylmannoside in the presence of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM MnCl2. GlcNAc phosphotransferase (10 μg, 100,000 units) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37°C for 18 h. A second reaction containing, in addition to the other components, 1 μCi of [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc was processed in parallel to calibrate the columns used for product isolation. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and applied to a 1-ml column of QAE-Sephadex A-25 equilibrated with 2 mM Tris base. The column was washed with 2 volumes of equilibration buffer, and the product was eluted with 2 ml of buffer containing 30 mM NaCl. The product was made 1 M in NH4COOCH3 and desalted on a 1.6 × 50-cm column of Bio-Gel P-2 equilibrated with water. The pooled product was concentrated by rotary evaporation and subjected to mass spectroscopy.Product Identification by Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF-MS)The mass of the enzymatic product was determined by MALDI-TOF-MS on a Hewlett-Packard LDI 1700XP mass spectrometer, which was operated at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV, an extractor voltage of 9 kV, and a pressure of 1.7 × 10−6 torr. Polarity was positive. The dried product was dissolved in 100 mM 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 90% (v/v) methanol. Approximately 1 μl of the sample/matrix was placed on the probe tip and vacuum-crystallized. Samples were desorbed/ionized from the probe tip with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm) with a pulse width of 3 ns and delivering ∼10.5 μJ of energy/laser pulse. The mass spectrum was recorded over a mass to charge (m/z) range of 1,000-2,500. The spectrum was averaged over 27 laser shots and plotted as arbitrary intensity versus m/z.Assay for GlcNAc-phosphotransferaseExperiments using α-methylmannoside as acceptor were performed as described (7Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), except that the [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc was isolated by HPLC as described (1Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity in each assay was increased to 0.5 μCi. In experiments utilizing glycoprotein acceptors, reaction mixtures containing 0.5-1.0 μCi of [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc were applied to a 1.0-ml column of ConA-Sepharose previously equilibrated with Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.3% Lubrol. Following washing with 20 ml of buffer, the resin was extruded into a scintillation vial and counted with 12 ml of Scintiverse BD. To avoid exceeding the capacity of the ConA-Sepharose columns in experiments using high concentrations of glycoprotein acceptors, only a fraction of the reaction mixture was applied to the ConA-Sepharose column.For experiments using UDP-Glc as donor, [β-32P]UDP-Glc was synthesized similarly to [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc (1Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and purified by HPLC. The product had a specific activity of 4 mCi/μmol and was stored in 50% ethanol at −20°C.Dependence of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase Activity on Reaction pHReaction mixtures contained 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM DTT, and 150 μM [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc. Each reaction was buffered to the indicated pH with a 250 mM concentration of one of the following buffers: sodium acetate, pH 3.9-4.25; MES/NaOH, pH 4.9-6.4; BisTris-HCl, pH 6.0-6.9; and Tris-HCl, pH 6.9-9.4.Assay of N-Acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester α-N-Acetylglucosaminidase (Uncovering Enyzme)[3H]GlcNAc-1-phospho-6-mannose α-methyl was prepared at a specific activity of 2.1 μCi/μmol as described (8Mullis K.G. Ketcham C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Uncovering enzyme activity was determined using 1 μg of purified GlcNAc-phosphotransferase as described (8Mullis K.G. Ketcham C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Preparation of Glycoprotein SubstratesUteroferrin was used without further purification. Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease B was obtained commercially and chromatographed on ConA-Sepharose to remove contaminating ribonuclease A as described previously (2Lang L. Reitman M. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Porcine cathepsin D was purified from frozen spleens as described previously (9Huang J.S. Huang S.S. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11405-11417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity was 30 units/mg, and the protein was >90% cathepsin D on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Protein DeterminationProteins were quantitated by absorbance at 280 nm using the following molar extinction coefficients: ribonuclease B, 8,756 (10Sherwood L.M. Potts Jr., J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); cathepsin D, 20,991 (2Lang L. Reitman M. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and uteroferrin, 31,000 (at 545 nm) (11Buhi W.C. Gray W.J. Mansfield E.A. Chun P.W. Ducsay C.A. Bazer F.W. Roberts R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 701: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations for all other proteins including GlcNAc-phosphotransferase were estimated assuming E1 cm1% = 10.0.Photoaffinity Labeling of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase with [β-32P]UDP-Glc5-N3-[β-32P]UDP-Glc was synthesized at a specific activity of 10 mCi/μmol as described previously (12Drake Jr., R.R. Evans R.K. Wolf M.J. Haley B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11928-11933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), purified by chromatography of the reaction mixture on a column of DEAE-cellulose, and stored in the dark at −20°C in methanol. Samples were prepared as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5. Following a 15-s incubation, the indicated samples were irradiated with a hand-held UV lamp with the glass face removed (5,000 microwatts/cm2; Model UVS-11, Ultra-Violet Products) at a distance of 4 cm for 45 s. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 100% trichloroacetic acid and incubation for 30 min at 0°C. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were dissolved in 25 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer by boiling for 5 min at 100°C and analyzed on an SDS-6% polyacrylamide gel (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). The dye front containing the unreacted 5-N3-[β-32P]UDP-Glc was cut off and discarded. The remaining gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography.AntibodiesAffinity-purified polyclonal antibodies were prepared against 488,000-fold purified bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. A New Zealand White rabbit was primed by intradermal injection of 20 μg of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant. Boosting was at 2-week intervals with 20 μg of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Blood was obtained from the central artery of the ear; antiserum was prepared; and immunoglobulins were isolated by precipitation with 50% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The pellet was dissolved in a minimal volume of phosphate-buffered saline and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase-specific antibodies were isolated by chromatography of the crude immunoglobulin fraction on a HiTrap NHS-activated column (1 ml) upon which 200 μg of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase had been immobilized according to the manufacturer's instructions. The column was then washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by water and eluted with 1 mM HCl. The eluted affinity-purified antibody was immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and concentrated to 1 mg/ml in a Centriprep 30 concentrator, made 1 mM in NaN3, and stored at 4°C.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used a homogeneous preparation of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase isolated from the lactating bovine mammary gland to investigate the enzymatic properties toward various acceptors. The data presented in this paper demonstrate that the bovine enzyme phosphorylates mammalian lysosomal enzymes better than non-lysosomal enzymes with similar oligosaccharide structures, similar to previous findings with partially purified rat (2Lang L. Reitman M. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lang L. Couso R. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6320-6325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and A. castellanii (6Ketcham C.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11654-11659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enzymes. These data extend the previous findings by demonstrating that this selectivity for lysosomal enzymes is a property of the purified GlcNAc-phosphotransferase complex and not the result of other factors or proteins.The selectivity of bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase for lysosomal enzymes results from two factors. First, the Km for uteroferrin is ∼56-fold lower than for ribonuclease B. Second, the Vmax for uteroferrin is ∼3-fold greater than for ribonuclease B. Together, these two factors result in a calculated catalytic efficiency ∼162-fold greater for the lysosomal enzyme acceptor. The use of lysosomal enzymes purified from lysosomes as acceptors is associated with inherent difficulties since the oligosaccharides have frequently been truncated by glycosidases present in the lysosome. The single oligosaccharide of uteroferrin is composed predominantly of Man5GlcNAc2 structures, with lesser amounts of Man6GlcNAc2 and Man4GlcNAc2 (17Saunders P.T.K. Renegar R.H. Raub T.J. Baumbach G.A. Atkinson P.H. Bazer F.W. Roberts R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3658-3665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since α-1,2-linked mannoses are absolutely required for an oligosaccharide to function as an acceptor for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (18Couso R. Lang L. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6326-6331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only the uteroferrin molecules bearing the Man6GlcNAc2 structures can function as acceptors, while the remaining molecules are competitive inhibitors. Because of these limitations in uteroferrin as an acceptor, the true difference between uteroferrin and ribonuclease B is likely to be at least 4-fold greater than determined. Ribonuclease B contains predominantly Man8GlcNAc2 structures and should provide an optimal oligosaccharide to function as an acceptor. The improved catalytic efficiency of ribonuclease B compared with that of α-methylmannoside likely results from the presence of the preferred α-1,2-linked mannose acceptor. Cathepsin D was also an effective substrate as indicated by a Km of 18 μM; however, the extent of labeling was low, likely as a result of the highly truncated oligosaccharides present on most molecules (19Takahashi T. Schmidt P.G. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2819-2830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of cathepsin D available prevented fractionation into specific glycoforms that would be expected to function as more efficient acceptors.With the identification of bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase as a multiple subunit enzyme, the association of specific functions with specific protein subunit(s) becomes possible. UDP-Glc was found to be a competitive inhibitor/alternate substrate for bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, similar to results previously reported for the rat enzyme (7Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The finding of strictly competitive inhibition indicates that UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc compete for the same nucleotide sugar-binding site. This observation allowed the identification of the subunit containing the nucleotide sugar-binding site with the photoprobe 5-N3-UDP-Glc. The 166-kDa subunit is specifically photoaffinity-labeled with the photoprobe 5-N3-[β-32P]UDP-Glc, indicating that the nucleotide sugar-binding site is localized to this subunit. INTRODUCTIONThe trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases to the lysosome in higher eucaryotes depends on the specific modification of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides to contain a mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker. The initial and determining step in the generation of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker is catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal-enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase). 1The abbreviations used are: GlcNAc-phosphotransferaseUDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal-enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase5-N3-UDP-Glc5-azidouridine 5′-diphosphoglucoseConAconconavalin AMALDI-TOF-MSmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopyHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyDTTdithiothreitolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Reactivity with monoclonal antibody I22 demonstrated substitution of these proteins with keratan sulfate chains. KSPG constituted 15% of the proteoglycan metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate in keratocyte culture medium.

The availability of cell cultures secreting corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycans provides an opportunity to examine biosynthesis and control of this important class of molecules. Keratan sulfate proteoglycans (KSPGs) 1The abbreviations used are: KSPGkeratan sulfate proteoglycanPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayBSAbovine serum albumin. represent the major class of proteoglycans in the corneal stroma (1Axelsson I.

KSPGs are thought to play an important role in corneal structure and physiology, particularly in the maintenance of corneal transparency (2Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 871-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These molecules consist of keratan sulfate chains attached to proteins via hybrid-type N-linked linkage oligosaccharides (3Nilsson B. Nakazawa K. Hassell J.R. Newsome D.A. Hascall V.C. J. Biol.

Three different corneal KSPG core proteins have been identified. All are members of a family of leucine-rich proteins that contains several other common proteoglycans (6Funderburgh J.L.

In noncorneal tissues the KSPG proteins are modified with oligomeric N-acetyllactosamine (i.e. short nonsulfated keratan sulfate) rather than the long, highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains characteristic of corneal KSPG (11Funderburgh J.L.

Corneal KSPGs are secreted by keratocytes, the predominant cell type of the corneal stroma (13Hart G.W. Dev. Biol. 1978; 62: 78-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Synthesis of normal KSPG molecules appears to be highly regulated in these cells. During development, migrating neural crest cells do not begin to secrete sulfated KSPG until their arrival in the stroma (14Funderburgh J.L. Caterson B. Conrad G.W. Dev.

In healing corneal wounds, rejecting corneal grafts, and other pathologic conditions of the cornea, sulfated KSPG is reduced or has an altered structure (16Cintron C. Kublin C.L. Dev.

More recent studies have shown that some keratocyte cultures synthesize the KSPG core proteins but do not add sulfated keratan sulfate to this protein (28Blochberger T.C. Vergnes J.-P. Hempel J.

In the present study, we examined cultured bovine keratocytes and found that these cells do, in fact, secrete sulfated KSPG, but the keratan sulfate chains of this compound are shorter and less highly sulfated than those of normal corneal KSPG. Bovine corneal KSPG (70P fraction) (30Conrad G.W. Ager-Johnson P. Woo M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 464-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), arterial lumican (11Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24773-24777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and endo-β-galactosidase (31Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3900-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. Purification of monoclonal antibody I22 against keratan sulfate and of affinity-purified antibodies against KSPG proteins also was described elsewhere (14Funderburgh J.L. Caterson B. Conrad G.W. Dev. Biol. 1986; 116: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Funderburgh J.L. Stenzel-Johnson P.R. Chandler J.W. Curr. Eye Res. 1983; 2: 769-776Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Purified bovine corneal keratan sulfate, keratanase (keratan sulfate 1,4-β-D-galactosidase, EC 3.2.1.103 from Pseudomonas sp.), and keratanase II (keratan sulfate endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Bacillus sp.) were purchased from Seikagaku America Inc. (Rockville, MD). For clarity, keratanase is referred to as keratanase I according to the convention of Ernst et al. (33Ernst S. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Central portions of fresh corneas from slaughter-aged steers were incubated in 0.2% trypsin in (NaCl, 0.137 M; KCl, 5 mM; Na2HPO4, 1 mM; KH2PO4, 1 mM; glucose, 60 mM, pH 7.2) for 10 min at 37°C, then epithelial and endothelial cells were removed by scraping in cold saline. The stroma was rinsed, minced, and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (Sigma, catalog no. D6905) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, 100 μg/ml; gentamicin, 50 μg/ml, amphotericin B, 2.5 μg/ml) in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Culture medium was changed weekly until keratocyte outgrowth became confluent (3-5 weeks). Cultures were maintained in closed 75-cm2 plastic flasks in an air atmosphere at 37°C and were passaged 1:2 after confluency by trypsinization. Cells were stored frozen in liquid nitrogen in the fourth passage. For KSPG production, confluent cultures (passage 6-10) were transferred into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium in 0.1% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) with antibiotics, insulin, 5 μg/ml, selenous acid, 5 ng/ml, and transferrin, 5 μg/ml (ITS, Collaborative Research Inc., Lexington, MA). Keratan sulfate was metabolically labeled by addition of carrier-free H235SO4, 100 μCi/ml for 3 days. Culture medium was collected and combined with a rinse of the cell layer in buffered saline. This soluble fraction contained all the detectable KSPG and was used as the source for KSPG for purification and analysis. Immunological detection of KSPG used solid phase ELISA and dot blot assays similar to those described previously (10Funderburgh J.L. Caterson B. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Funderburgh, J. L., Conrad, G. W., Greiling, H., Scott, J. E., (eds) (1989) Keratan Sulphate.

ELISA assays were carried out in Immulon II 96-well plates (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA) using TTTBS (0.15 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.1% thimerosal) for rinses, and TTTBS with 1% BSA for antibody solutions. Samples were analyzed in triplicate, and specific binding was determined by subtracting blanks omitting primary antibodies. Dot blotting of column fractions was carried out on nitrocellulose as described previously (18Funderburgh J.L. Panjwani N. Conrad G.W. Baum J.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1989; 30: 2278-2281PubMed Google Scholar) using luminescent detection (9Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Bottomley G.S. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol.

Film images were digitized using a 12-bit CCD camera and quantified with NIH Image software (available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). Immune precipitation of KSPG from culture medium used protein G-agarose (Pierce). The washed beads were incubated with an equal volume of antiserum for 4 h at room temperature, then washed by centrifugation three times in 1% BSA in TTTBS. Antibody-loaded beads were used immediately or stored 4°C for up to 1 week. Twenty microliters of packed beads were incubated with 250 μl of labeled culture medium overnight at 4°C on a rotating mixer. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, then resuspended and agitated gently in 1 ml of 1% BSA in TTTBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min. Wash in this buffer was repeated twice with BSA, twice without BSA, and once in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Bound proteins were released by resuspending the beads in 50 μl of 6 M urea, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 8, and the proteoglycan was subjected to gel filtration analysis described below. Proteoglycans were purified from culture medium by ion exchange chromatography and alcohol fractionation. Solid, molecular biology-grade urea was added to culture fluid to make a final concentration of 6 M. The culture fluid was passed over DEAE-Sephacel columns (0.5 ml of packed gel/5 ml of medium) and washed with 10-15 column volumes of 0.1 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 8, in 6 M urea. Proteoglycans were eluted with 3 column volumes of 4 M guanidine HCl, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 8. The proteoglycan fraction was concentrated by membrane filtration and precipitated at −20°C in 60% (v/v) ethanol. After removal of the precipitate by centrifugation, the KSPG was precipitated from the supernatant by adding ethanol to 80% for 16 h at −20°C. SDS-PAGE was carried out on 6 × 8 × 0.075-cm, 12% polyacrylamide gels followed by electrotransfer and immunoblotting with affinity-purified antibody against KSPG proteins as described previously (9Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Bottomley G.S. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9759-9763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Purified KSPG diluted in culture medium and cell-conditioned medium were separated by ion exchange HPLC on Mono Q columns in 6 M urea, 0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with a 0-2 M NaCl gradient as described previously (7Funderburgh J.L. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8297-8303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KSPG in the fractions was diluted 200-fold and detected by direct ELISA. Keratan sulfate was isolated from KSPG by digestion for 2 h at 50°C with 20 μg/ml proteinase K in 0.2 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM CaCl, followed by a second addition of 20 μg/ml proteinase K and continued digestion for 14-16 h. Digestion was stopped with addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 5 mM and heating at 85°C for 5 min. To each sample, 20 μl of 1% blue dextran and 10 μl of 5% K2Fe(CN)6 were added, and the keratan sulfate chains were separated on a 1 × 30-cm column of Superdex 200 HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) eluted at 0.25 ml/min with 0.2 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 8. Keratan sulfate was detected by the dimethylmethylene blue assay (34Melrose J. Ghosh P. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or by scintillation counting. Calibration of the size of the keratan sulfate was carried out with polyvinyl sulfonate standards of known molecular size (Polysciences Inc., Warington, PA). The molecular size standards were also analyzed on Sephadex G-200 gel columns to confirm that the fractionation coefficients for polyvinyl sulfonate match the those previously determined by Hopwood and Robinson (35Hopwood J.J. Robinson H.C. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) for keratan sulfate. For disaccharide analysis, peak fractions of unlabeled bovine corneal keratan sulfate (0.2 mg) and [35S]sulfate-labeled keratocyte keratan sulfate from Superdex 200 columns were dialyzed against water in dialysis tubing with a 1500-Da pore size and lyophilized. These samples were digested in 200 μl of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.8, with 0.01 unit of endo-β-galactosidase or keratanase II overnight at 37°C. The digestion products were centrifuged through an ultrafiltration membrane with a 3-kDa cutoff. The flow-through material containing released oligosaccharides was vacuum dried, then dissolved in 100 μl of 0.5 M sodium borate, pH 9.5. Five mCi of NaB3H4 (25 Ci/mol) were added in 50 μl of 0.01 M NaOH. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, 100 μl of 1 M unlabeled NaBH4 were added for 2 h to complete reduction. Borate was removed by repeated drying from methanol in a stream of nitrogen. The reduced oligosaccharides were analyzed on a 1 × 50-cm column of TSK-HW40S gel (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA) eluted in 0.1 M NH4HCO3 at 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. Di- and tetrasaccharides released by hyaluronidase digestion of chondroitin sulfate were used as standards. The radioactive disaccharides in each preparation were collected, dried, and analyzed by high pH anion exchange chromatography using a Dionex PA-100 column eluted with 20 mM NaOH at 1 ml/min. A gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.2 M NaCl at 5 to 20 min, then to 1.0 M NaCl at 35 min, eluted the sulfated disaccharides. Fractions of 0.5 min were collected, and 3H and 35S radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Initial experiments determined that conditioned medium from cultures of bovine keratocytes contained proteins recognized by antibodies to corneal KSPG. Fig. 1 shows immunoblotting of the KSPG antigens from culture medium after electrophoretic separation by SDS-PAGE. The KSPG from culture medium (lane 3) was heterogeneous in size (70 to >100 kDa), larger than arterial lumican, a nonsulfated form of KSPG protein (lane 2), but smaller than the KSPG from cornea (lane 1). Unconditioned medium (lane 4) had no detectable KSPG. Three KSPG core proteins from corneal stroma can be separated by ion exchange chromatography and SDS-PAGE after removal of their modifying keratan sulfate chains with endo-β-galactosidase (6Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrated keratocyte-conditioned culture medium was treated with endo-β-galactosidase, then proteins in the medium were separated by Mono Q ion exchange chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2A, the KSPG antigens, detected by ELISA, were separated into two somewhat heterogeneous components, similar in distribution to the core proteins of purified corneal KSPG (Fig. 2B). Immunoblotting of the KSPG proteins in the pooled peak fractions from these columns is shown in Fig. 3. Purified corneal KSPG proteins from the A region of both columns contained 48- and 36-kDa proteins (lanes 1 and 3). These proteins were previously identified as proteins 37A (keratocan) and 25. In lanes 2 and 4, proteins in the B fractions from both keratocyte culture medium and purified corneal KSPG separated as a single 48-50-kDa protein, previously shown to be lumican (protein 37B) (6Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that all three KSPG proteins previously identified in cornea are secreted by stromal keratocytes into the culture medium.Fig. 3Immunoblotting of separated core proteins. Pooled fractions of KSPG proteins from Fig. 2 were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected with antibody against KSPG core proteins. Lanes 1 and 2 are from conditioned culture medium. Lanes 3 and 4 are from purified KSPG. Pool A (Fig. 2) is shown in lanes 1 and 3. Pool B is shown in lanes 2 and 4. The size of the upper bands was determined to be 48-50 kDa based on standard mobilities and the lower bands approximately 36 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sulfation of corneal KSPGs allows separation of these molecules from the noncorneal forms of the KSPG proteins by ion-exchange HPLC. Fig. 4A shows separation of corneal KSPG by gradient elution from a Mono Q ion exchange column. In Fig. 4B, the nonsulfated form of KSPG from artery (arterial lumican) was found to elute at lower salt concentrations than did corneal KSPG. Fig. 4C shows that Mono Q chromatography under the same conditions separated KSPG antigens from cell culture medium into two major components, one eluting at an ionic strength similar to arterial lumican and one eluting at higher salt concentrations, slightly before corneal KSPG. The data in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 indicate that some of the KSPG in keratocyte-conditioned culture medium is larger and some more highly charged than the nonsulfated form of these molecules. These physical characteristics suggest that a portion of the KSPG protein secreted in cell culture contains keratan sulfate. Keratan sulfate in these molecules was confirmed by reactivity with antibody I22, a monoclonal antibody specific for sulfated epitopes on the keratan sulfate chain (32Funderburgh J.L. Stenzel-Johnson P.R. Chandler J.W. Curr. Eye Res. 1983; 2: 769-776Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows results of a sandwich ELISA that detects molecules reacting simultaneously with antibody I22 and with anti-core protein antibodies (12Funderburgh, J. L., Conrad, G. W., Greiling, H., Scott, J. E., (eds) (1989) Keratan Sulphate. Chemistry, Biology, Chemical Pathology, pp. 39–52, The Biochemical Society, London.Google Scholar, 17Funderburgh J.L. Cintron C. Covington H.I. Conrad G.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 1116-1124PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, this assay has a high sensitivity for corneal KSPG, but did not detect nonsulfated arterial lumican, even in 10,000-fold excess. Conditioned medium from the keratocyte cultures reacted readily in the assay (Fig. 5B), indicating the presence of keratan sulfate-containing KSPG in these cultures. Reactivity was eliminated on treatment of the conditioned medium with endo-β-galactosidase, an enzyme that degrades keratan sulfate. No reactivity was observed in unconditioned medium (Fig. 5B). Secreted proteoglycans, metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate, were isolated from culture medium by ion exchange chromatography and separated by gel filtration on Superose 6. As shown in Fig. 6A, about 85% of the 35S-proteoglycans eluted as a high molecular weight component (Kav = 0.2) and about 15% as a smaller (Kav = 0.76) component. The larger 35S-labeled component was found to be 90% sensitive to chondroitinase ABC, whereas the smaller component was not sensitive to chondroitinase (data not shown). KSPG antigens (Fig. 6A, open circles) eluted in the region of the smaller, chondroitinase-resistant component. KSPG proteins immune-precipitated from labeled culture medium eluted at the same volume as the smaller proteoglycan peak (Fig. 6B). Similarly, KSPG isolated by differential alcohol fractionation produced a labeled component of a size identical to the immune-precipitated KSPG (Fig. 6C). Ion exchange in combination with alcohol precipitation was used to purify labeled KSPG for further analysis. Treatment of 35S-labeled KSPG with proteinase K released a macromolecular material (Figs. 7, A and B) that was shown to be keratan sulfate by its sensitivity to endo-β-galactosidase (Fig. 7C) and keratanase I (Fig. 7D). Endo-β-galactosidase hydrolyzes both sulfated and nonsulfated keratan sulfate moieties, but keratanase I requires sulfation of glucosamine of the hydrolyzed disaccharide (33Ernst S. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The extent of the degradation of keratan sulfate from cell culture by keratanase I demonstrates that the sulfate label in these molecules is a component of keratan sulfate disaccharides and not associated with residual core proteins. Further characterization of this sulfation was carried out by analysis of the disaccharides released after endo-β-galactosidase or keratanase II treatment. Oligosaccharides from the digests were 3H-labeled by reduction with 3H-sodium borohydride and then separated by gel filtration. As shown in Fig. 8A (solid circles), about two thirds of the sulfated products released by endo-β-galactosidase digestion eluted at a volume similar to disaccharide standards, and the remaining one third eluted as tetrasaccharides. Nonspecific tritium labeling was present in unidentified components smaller than the disaccharide standards, but specific labeling was primarily found associated with the disaccharide fractions (open circles). Tritiated digestion products from purified corneal keratan sulfate (Fig. 8C) also were primarily disaccharides. In contrast to endo-β-galactosidase, keratanase II cleaves keratan sulfate only at sites of sulfated glucosamine moieties (36Nakazawa, K., Ito, M., Tamagata, T., Suzuki, S., Greiling, H., Scott, J. E., (eds) (1989) Keratan Sulfate: Chemistry, Biology, Chemical Pathology, pp. 99–110, Biochemical Society, London.Google Scholar). The sulfated products produced by keratanase II digestion of keratan sulfate labeled in culture (Fig. 8C, closed circles) consisted of about 80% disaccharides and about 20% of a component eluting between the di- and tetrasaccharide standards. Specific labeling with tritium was associated mostly with the disaccharide fraction from keratan sulfate from culture (Fig. 8C, open circles) and from cornea (Fig. 8D). Fractions from the disaccharide regions of the four samples in Fig. 8 were pooled and further analyzed by high pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC). Fig. 9A shows that 35S-labeled disaccharides released by endo-β-galactosidase from keratocyte keratan sulfate eluted with a salt gradient as a single peak. Tritium label in the same sample (Fig. 9B) eluted both with the sulfated peak and also with a component weakly retained by the column. Disaccharides from corneal keratan sulfate (Fig. 9C) contained two 3H-labeled components similar to those of the keratan sulfate made in vitro. This pattern of separation is consistent with the predicted release of nonsulfated and monosulfated disaccharides by endo-β-galactosidase. Chromatography of the weakly bound 3H-component using conditions that resolve uncharged mono- and disaccharides (data not shown) supported the conclusion that this material is an unsulfated keratan sulfate disaccharide. The ratio of nonsulfated to monosulfated disaccharides was about 6:4 in vitro and approximately 1:9 from corneal keratan sulfate. The keratan sulfate made in vitro, therefore, has a significantly higher proportion of nonsulfated disaccharides than corneal keratan sulfate. Keratanase II cleaves keratan sulfate at sites of sulfated N-acetylglucosamine, irrespective of sulfation of the galactose moieties; therefore, digests should contain only monosulfated and disulfated disaccharides. As predicted, two sulfated disaccharide peaks were obtained from keratocyte keratan sulfate (Fig. 9D), one eluting at a salt concentration similar to the monosulfated disaccharide released by endo-β-galactosidase and one at a higher salt concentration. 3H-Labeled disaccharides from both keratocyte and corneal keratan sulfate eluted at positions similar to the two sulfated disaccharides (Fig. 9, E and F). The 3H/35S ratios of the two peaks are consistent with the second peak having two sulfates per disaccharide. The ratio of 3H-monosulfated to disulfated disaccharides in this digest was 6:1 for both keratocyte and corneal keratan sulfate. The presence of mono- and disulfated disaccharides in keratan sulfate from culture medium demonstrates the ability of keratocytes to sulfate both galactose and N-acetylglucosamine moieties of the keratan sulfate in vitro. The size of the keratan sulfate chains from KSPG made in vitro was compared using gel filtration to that of corneal keratan sulfate. As shown in Fig. 10B, bovine corneal keratan sulfate was quite heterogeneous with a size range of 10 to 50 kDa and a median estimated at 21 kDa based on the elution volumes of standard sulfated polymers. The labeled keratan sulfate from culture medium (Fig. 10A) was estimated as 4.7 kDa under the same conditions. The experiments presented here characterize the KSPG secreted by continuous cultures of bovine keratocytes. These proteoglycan molecules contained all three of the core proteins previously identified in corneal KSPG. Attached to these proteins were keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains containing nonsulfated, monosulfated, and disulfated N-acetyllactosamine disaccharides. The keratan sulfate chains were smaller and less highly sulfated than those isolated in vivo. The presence of keratan sulfate in these molecules was documented in several ways. (a) Some of the KSPG molecules from culture were larger and some more highly charged than the nonsulfated KSPG of artery, suggesting the presence of glycosaminoglycan chains. (b) KSPG from cultures reacted with a keratan sulfate-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-core protein antibodies simultaneously demonstrating association of the proteins with keratan sulfate. (c) The antigenic keratan sulfate and purified 35S-labeled keratan sulfate were both sensitive to three different keratan sulfate-specific endoglycosidases. (d) Chromatographic properties of the disaccharides released by glycosidase digestion were identical to disaccharides released from authentic corneal keratan sulfate. The finding that cultured cells can express corneal keratan sulfates in a stable manner is a novel and potentially useful discovery. More than two decades ago Conrad and Dorfman (24Conrad G.W. Dorfman A. Exp. Eye Res. 1974; 18: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) showed that secretion of highly sulfated keratan sulfate ceased in chick corneas in organ culture in 48 h and that in primary keratocytes the keratan sulfate secretion disappeared after six hours in culture. Since that report absence of keratan sulfate synthesis by cultured keratocytes has been confirmed repeatedly (23Bleckmann H. Kresse H. Exp. Eye Res. 1980; 30: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 24Conrad G.W. Dorfman A. Exp. Eye Res. 1974; 18: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Dahl I.M. Coster L. Exp.

Biophys. 1992; 292: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mammalian corneas in culture appear to secrete keratan sulfate for somewhat longer periods of time, in one case up to 2 weeks in culture; however, as with chick keratocytes, biosynthesis of keratan sulfate was lost rapidly when the cells were separated from the stromal matrix (37Coster L. Cintron C. Damle S.P. Gregory J.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1983; 36: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 38Dahl I.M. Laurent T.C. Exp.

The success of the current study at identifying stable corneal keratan sulfate synthesis in vitro after so many previous attempts is probably the result of a number of factors. Methodology clearly played some part. Earlier studies often employed extensive dialysis of protease-treated proteoglycans, a technique that probably resulted in loss of much of the keratan sulfate due to its small size. It is also clear that there are species differences. Recent studies with chick keratocytes demonstrated synthesis of a glycosylated KSPG that was sensitive to endo-β-galactosidase but not to keratanase I, a clear indication that the carbohydrate chains made by chick keratocytes were not sulfated (29Schrecengost P.K. Blochberger T.C. Hassell J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A second study found that human keratocytes secrete very little KSPG protein (26Hassell J.R. Schrecengost P.K. Rada J.A. SundarRaj N. Sossi G. Thoft R.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 547-557PubMed Google Scholar). The species from which the keratocyte cultures are derived may, therefore, be a determining factor in their ability to secrete keratan sulfate on a long term basis. The keratan sulfate made in keratocyte cultures was sulfated on both galactose and glucosamine moieties; consequently these cells probably express all of the enzymes required for normal keratan sulfate biosynthesis. The KSPG molecules made in the cultures, however, were markedly different from those made in vivo. The relative proportion of nonsulfated disaccharides was higher in keratan sulfate from cell culture than in corneal keratan sulfate and the overall chain length of the keratan sulfate made in vitro was much shorter. Oben et al. (40Oben M. Keller R. Stuhlsatz H.W. Greiling H. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have a developed a model of corneal keratan sulfate that proposes each chain contains four nonsulfated disaccharides proximal to the linkage region followed by 10-12 monosulfated disaccharides. The nonreducing terminus of each chain contains a domain of variable length composed primarily of disulfated disaccharides (40Oben M. Keller R. Stuhlsatz H.W. Greiling H. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In a keratan sulfate molecule of median size, 24 disulfated disaccharides are found, producing a molecule of Mr 20,000. Based on a molecular size of 4700 Da and the ratios of hydrolysis products from Fig. 8, Fig. 9, we estimate that the keratan sulfate chains made by bovine keratocytes contain 4 nonsulfated disaccharides, 4 or 5 monosulfated disaccharides, and 1-2 disulfated disaccharides. These molecules may therefore start with a “standard” nonsulfated region but have less than half the typical monosulfated disaccharide and a greatly truncated disulfated domain compared to the typical corneal keratan sulfate molecule. The results of this analysis suggest that bovine keratocytes in culture produce the “constant” (nonsulfated) portion of the typical keratan sulfate chain but do not extend the “variable” (sulfated) region of the chain as efficiently as they do in vivo. Keller et al. (41Keller R. Stein T. Weber W. Kehrer T. Stuhlsatz H.W. Greiling H. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 253-260PubMed Google Scholar) suggest a correspondence between elongation of the keratan sulfate chain and the rapidity of its sulfation during biosynthesis. Accordingly, the differences between keratan sulfate proteoglycans produced in vitro and those found in the normal cornea might arise by the alteration of a single step in the biosynthetic pathway, possibly a decrease in the activity of one of the glycosyltransferase enzymes. Our results present the first cell culture system exhibiting a stable expression of corneal keratan sulfate in amounts sufficient to be purified and characterized. The presence both mono- and disulfated disaccharides indicates that all of the enzymatic facilities are present in these cells for production of normal keratan sulfate. This finding is significant because extracts of keratocytes are difficult to obtain from intact cornea due to the low cell number and the extreme durability of the tissue. Previous studies involving purification and characterization of the enzymes involved in keratan sulfate synthesis have been limited. The cell culture system described here can provide a useful tool for analysis of the molecular mechanisms that control biosynthesis of these important molecules."

Using in vitro replication of SV40 origin containing DNA as a model system, we have performed a detailed analysis of the dependence on cyclin-associated kinases of mammalian DNA replication. Complete immunodepletion of cyclin A from human S phase cell extracts decreases replication, and replication activity of cyclin A-depleted S phase extracts can subsequently be restored by the addition of purified CDK2-cyclin A kinase. Addition of cyclin A alone reconstitutes both kinase activity and DNA replication, whereas addition of cyclin E or cyclin B reconstitutes neither. We therefore conclude that reconstitution of DNA replication specifically correlates with an increase in kinase activity. By comparison, depletion of cyclin E from S phase cell extracts does not have any significant inhibitory effect on DNA replication. Moreover, specific p21Waf1 mutants that bind to CDK2-cyclin and inhibit both cyclin A and cyclin E kinase activities, but do not bind to proliferating cell nuclear antigen, inhibit DNA replication to the same extent as cyclin A depletion. Together, these results show that the kinase activity associated with cyclin A, but not with cyclin E, is primarily responsible for activating SV40 plasmid replication in mammalian S phase cell extracts. Finally, we present evidence that the cyclin-dependent kinase does not influence the assembly of initiation complexes but acts at a stage prior to elongation.

Replication of DNA is a strictly regulated event that occurs at a discrete period during the cell cycle. Cell cycle progression is regulated by distinct cyclin-dependent kinases that activate at different times in the cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 1Reed S.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 529-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, cyclin E-dependent kinase is activated at the G1 to S phase transition, after the D type cyclins but prior to A type cyclins (reviewed in Ref. 2Pines J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Microinjection of either anti-cyclin A antibody (3Girard F. Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C.

Similarly, microinjection of anti-cyclin E antibody also prevents the entry of cells into S phase (6Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). However, unlike cyclin E-dependent kinase activity, the timing of activation of cyclin A-associated kinase activity in human cells coincides with the onset of DNA synthesis in S phase, which occurs several hours subsequent to the commitment to S phase (7Pines J. Hunter T. Nature. 1990; 346: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 8Pagano M. Draetta G. Jansen-Durr P.

Cyclin-dependent kinases have been implicated as inducers of DNA replication using systems for in vitro replication of DNA. p13suc1, the product of Schizosaccharomyces pombe suc1 gene, binds avidly to active forms of CDC2 and CDK2 (10Labbé J.C.

The removal of Cdk2 and Cdc2 proteins from an in vitro Xenopus egg extract replication system, using p13suc1 affinity matrices, has been shown to decrease its ability to replicate sperm DNA (13Blow J.J. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 62: 855-862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Chevalier S. Tassan J.P. Cox R. Philippe M. Ford C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1831-1841PubMed Google Scholar). Specific depletion of Cdk2 protein, but not of Cdc2 protein from Xenopus egg extracts, has been shown to correlate with a decreased ability of these extracts to replicate sperm DNA (15Fang F. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Recently, a similar inhibition of DNA replication was observed following depletion of cyclin E from Xenopus egg extracts (16Jackson P.K. Chevalier S. Philippe M. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the SV40 in vitro replication system the inability of human G1 extracts to replicate SV40 origin containing DNA (17Roberts J.M. D'Urso G. Science. 1988; 241: 1486-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) can be overcome by the addition of cyclin A (18D'Urso G. Marraccino R.L. Marshak D.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1990; 250: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or an active CDC2 kinase (19Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Both cyclin A and Cdk2 are associated with SV40 origin containing DNA during replication in vitro (20Fotedar R. Roberts J.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). RPA, a cellular single-stranded DNA binding protein, and SV40 T antigen are both phosphorylated by Cdc2-associated kinase in vitro. Phosphorylation of bacterially expressed T antigen by cdc2 kinase increases its affinity for the SV40 origin of replication (21McVey D. Brizuela L. Mohr I. Marshak D.R. Gluzman Y. Beach D. Nature. 1989; 341: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the stimulation of DNA replication by CDC2 kinase in G1 cell extracts was shown not to be due to phosphorylation of T antigen by CDC2 kinase (18D'Urso G. Marraccino R.L. Marshak D.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1990; 250: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 19Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Instead, these studies suggested that phosphorylation of the 34-kDa subunit of RPA during G1 to S phase transition may contribute to the activation of origin unwinding and subsequent DNA replication. The functional significance of phosphorylation of the 34-kDa subunit of RPA by CDC2 kinase (19Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 22Pan Z.Q. Amin A.A. Gibbs E. Niu H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) remains to be established, since mutation of the CDC2 consensus phosphorylation sites on RPA-34 has no effect on in vitro SV40 replication (23Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although previous studies, discussed above, have implicated cdk-cyclins in DNA replication, such studies have not explicitly addressed whether it is the kinase activity itself which is important for DNA replication in S phase or if the cdk-cyclin plays a structural role in replication. Reconstitution of replication activity in G1 extracts by the addition of cyclin A or of Cdc2 kinase demonstrates a role for cdk-cyclins in activating events in G1, but it does not address whether the kinase is required during replication in S phase cell extracts (18D'Urso G. Marraccino R.L. Marshak D.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1990; 250: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 19Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Here we have used the SV40 in vitro replication system to examine the regulation of DNA replication by cyclin-associated kinases in S phase cell extracts, and we have specifically addressed whether cyclin-dependent kinase activity is important for DNA replication. Furthermore, since both cyclins A and E are present in S phase cell extracts, we have addressed whether the cyclin A or the cyclin E-dependent kinase has a specific function during DNA replication. We show that cyclin A is specifically required for efficient replication of DNA in S phase, since complete immunodepletion of cyclin A-associated kinase from S phase cell extracts leads to a decrease in the ability of these extracts to support DNA replication. Addition of either purified cyclin A-associated CDK2 kinase or of purified cyclin A alone, but not of cyclin E or cyclin B, fully restores replication activity in these depleted extracts. Furthermore, an increase in kinase activity is specifically required for the reconstitution of replication activity of cyclin A-depleted cell extracts. We have also determined if DNA replication can be suppressed by specific interaction of p21Waf1/Cip1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (24Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K.

Released cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometric analysis. S-100 supernatants containing 100 mM NaCl were made from hypotonic lysates of Manca cells in S phase as described earlier (29Fotedar R. Roberts J.M.

Replication reactions were performed in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP, and DNA synthesis was quantitated by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]dCMP into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts (31Stillman B.W.

In all reactions, the protein concentration of S phase cell extracts was adjusted to 100 μg per 50-μl reaction. In Fig. 8, the effect of p21 proteins and the effect of cyclin A addition on DNA elongation was determined by performing replication in two steps. In the first step, SV40 T antigen (1 μg) was preincubated for 30 min at 37°C with S-100 S phase Manca cell extracts (100 μg) and with SV40 origin containing plasmids (150 ng) in the presence of 3 mM ATP to allow the formation of initiation complexes on DNA (29Fotedar R.

In the second step, elongation was initiated by the addition of ribonucleoside triphosphates (except ATP) and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates.

In Fig. 9B, cyclin A was added at the time of elongation.Fig. 9Cyclin-dependent kinase activity is required to activate assembled initiation complexes.

Briefly, in the first step, SV40 T antigen was preincubated for 20 min at 37°C with either cyclin A-depleted or control cell extracts and with SV40 origin containing plasmids in the presence of 3 mM ATP to allow the formation of initiation complexes on DNA. In the second step, elongation was initiated by the addition of the remaining ribonucleoside triphosphates, dTTP and dATP. At this time the reaction was given a pulse of [α-32P]dCTP for 30 s (33Eki T. Matsumoto T. Murakami Y. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7284-7294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elongation reaction was limited during the pulse by the absence of dGTP. The pulse was terminated by adding 100-fold excess cold dCTP, and dGTP was added to the reaction to allow elongation during the chase. The reaction was then allowed to continue at 37°C. Aliquots were removed at various time points during the chase, and replication was terminated at each time point by adding an equal volume of 0.4% SDS and 100 mM EDTA. The reaction products were then digested with proteinase K at 37°C for 1 h. Finally, the samples were extracted with equal volume of chloroform:phenol, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 50 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, and then analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel in 30 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA (34Ishimi Y.

After electrophoresis, the agarose gel was fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min followed by 15 min in 10% acetic acid, 12% methanol. The gel was then rinsed with distilled water, dried on DE81 paper (Whatmann), and autoradiographed. Rabbit polyclonal antisera, raised against bacterially expressed human cyclin A and affinity purified antibodies, were kindly provided to us by M. Ohtsubo and J. Roberts (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle). The specificity of anti-cyclin A antibody has been confirmed using recombinant cyclin proteins. Specificity of cyclin A antibodies was additionally confirmed by immunoprecipitating cyclin A from G1, S, and mitotic phase extracts and assaying for histone H-1 kinase activity (30Brenot-Bosc F. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fotedar R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1995; 103: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was also raised against synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of human CDK2 (CDVTKPVPHLRL) (30Brenot-Bosc F. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fotedar R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1995; 103: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Antiserum to CDK2 was affinity purified on a Sepharose 4B column containing covalently coupled peptide. Monoclonal antibody recognizing human PCNA was purchased from Coulter Immunology (Clone 19A2) and monoclonal antibody recognizing cyclin E was purchased from Oncogene. All the steps of immunodepletion were performed at 4°C. S phase Manca cell extract (25 mg of S-100 cell extract) was adjusted to 40 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 8 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin (IP buffer) and loaded on a column containing 1 ml of packed protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) coupled to anti-cyclin A antibody. Extracts passed over Protein A-Sepharose coupled with nonimmune rabbit immunoglobulins were similarly treated and used as controls. After 20 passages through the column, the flow-through comprising the depleted cell extract was collected, aliquoted, and stored at −70°C for further use in the replication assay. The columns were regenerated with 100 mM glycine HCl (pH 3.0) after use, washed with IP buffer without Nonidet P-40, and stored in the presence of 0.02% sodium azide. All the steps were performed at 4°C, and the tubes were gently rocked during the incubations. 100 μg of S phase cell extract was adjusted to 40 mM Hepes, 8 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin (IP buffer) and added to 10 μl of packed Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) that had been preincubated with anti-cyclin A antibody for 1 h and washed five times with IP buffer. After 1 h, Protein A-Sepharose containing the cyclin A immunocomplexes was washed three times with IP buffer and twice with kinase buffer (40 mM Hepes, 8 mM MgCl2). Kinase assays were performed in 18 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 40 mM Hepes, 8 mM MgCl2, 166 μM ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN, 3,000 Ci/mmol), 4 μg of histone H-1 (Boehringer Mannheim), and 10 μl of packed Protein A-Sepharose as described earlier (30Brenot-Bosc F. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fotedar R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1995; 103: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After 20 min at 37°C, the reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. Two-fifths of the reactions were loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and autoradiographed. For quantitation, the histone H-1 bands were excised from the gel and subjected to scintillation counting. Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted as described earlier (30Brenot-Bosc F. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fotedar R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1995; 103: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose filters were processed for ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence system; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) Western blot procedure as instructed by the suppliers. The full-length p21 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription of Jurkat poly(A)+ RNA, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two sets of nested p21-specific primers. Sequence analysis revealed that the PCR product was identical in sequence to the published human p21 cDNA (35El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). The deletion mutants of p21 were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the full-length p21 and PCR products of mutant p21 were cloned in-frame into a pGEX vector that expressed them as GST-fusion proteins. The recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli (DH5α) as described earlier (36Fotedar R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Cannella D. Doree M. Messier H. Fotedar A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2155-2164PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin B-Cdc2 kinase was purified to apparent homogeneity from maturing starfish oocytes as described previously (37Labbé J.C. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recombinant cyclin A-CDK2 kinase was prepared from human cyclin A and GST-CDK2, both produced in E. coli and purified as described in Lorca et al. (38Lorca T. Labbé J.C. Devault A. Fesquet D. Strausfeld U. Nilsson J. Nygren P.A. Uhlen M. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 55-62PubMed Google Scholar). Highly purified CAK (Cdk Activating Kinase), purified to the Mono S step from starfish oocytes (39Fesquet D. Labbé J.C. Derancourt J. Capony J.P. Galas S. Girard F. Lorca T. Shuttleworth J. Doree M. Cavadore J.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3111-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), was used to stoichiometrically phosphorylate GST-cdk2 in a mixture containing 0.33 mM ATP, 16.6 μM MgCl2, 30 μg/ml GST-cdk2, and 100 μg/ml cyclin A in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5). The GST-CDK2-cyclin A kinase was then purified using glutathione affinity matrix by standard procedures. GST-cyclin A (40Atherton-Fessler S. Parker L.L. Geahlen R.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), GST-cyclin B (41Solomon M.J. Glotzer M. Lee T.H. Philippe M. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1990; 63: 1013-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and GST-cyclin E (42Koff A. Cross F. Fisher A. Schumacher J. Leguellec K. Philippe M. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 1217-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) were produced in bacteria and purified by identical procedures using a glutathione affinity matrix as described (36Fotedar R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Cannella D. Doree M. Messier H. Fotedar A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2155-2164PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin A was immunodepleted from S phase cell extracts using a cyclin A-specific antibody, under conditions that were compatible with subsequent use of the depleted cell extract for replication assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following depletion, there was no detectable cyclin A in the depleted extract (Fig. 1). Control S phase extracts treated identically with nonimmune rabbit antibody completely retain cyclin A (Fig. 1). Cyclin A has been reported to be in a quaternary complex with proliferating nuclear cell antigen (PCNA), p21, and Cdk2 in nontransformed cells (43Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1572-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). We therefore determined if depletion of cyclin A resulted in a loss of PCNA that could consequently affect the replication activity of the extracts. Fig. 1 shows that the level of PCNA was not significantly different following depletion of cyclin A from S phase cell extracts, in comparison to control extracts (Fig. 1). Depletion of cyclin A from S phase extracts results in complete loss of cyclin A-associated H-1 kinase activity (Fig. 1), although the amount of CDK2 protein does not change significantly after depletion (Fig. 1). There is a substantial loss of CDK2-associated kinase activity in cyclin A-depleted extracts (Fig. 1). This result suggests that the active form of CDK2 in S phase extracts is predominantly associated with cyclin A and constitutes a small fraction of the total CDK2. In keeping with this result, the kinase activity associated with cyclin E in these cell extracts was 10-fold lower than that associated with cyclin A or CDK2 (data not shown). DNA replication in control extracts treated with nonimmune rabbit antibody is largely completed by 90 min (data not shown). The extent of DNA synthesis in cyclin A-depleted S phase cell extracts was therefore compared with control extracts after 90 min of reaction. In four independent experiments, cyclin A-depleted extracts exhibited 40-60% of the level of replication observed in control extracts (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that the inhibition of DNA replication observed in cyclin A-depleted extracts cannot be prevented by the presence of phosphatase inhibitors in depleted cell extracts, indicating that the inhibition is not due to dephosphorylation of previously phosphorylated proteins required for replication. Complete depletion of cyclin A from S phase extracts did not lead to total inhibition of DNA replication. To test if cyclin E kinase activity may be responsible for activating the residual levels of DNA replication, cyclin E was immunodepleted from S phase extracts. When these extracts were tested for replication activity, there was only a 10-15% reduction of DNA replication compared with control extracts. Similarly, immunodepletion of both cyclin A and cyclin E from S phase extracts results in only an additional 10-15% inhibition of DNA replication, compared with extracts depleted of cyclin A alone. Depletion of cyclin E therefore does not have a significant inhibitory effect on DNA replication. To demonstrate that the inhibition of DNA replication is indeed due to depletion of cyclin A and not due to depletion of another protein associated with cyclin A, we tested the ability of CDK2-associated cyclin A kinase to restore DNA replication in cyclin A-depleted cell extracts. Fig. 3 shows that purified cyclin A-CDK2 kinase fully rescues DNA replication in depleted extracts and brings replication to the level observed in control cell extracts. In contrast, no more than 1-2 pmol of dCMP are incorporated in a control experiment, where addition of cyclin A is performed in the absence of T antigen. This low level of incorporation probably represents repair. DNA replication was reconstituted by the addition of exogenous cyclin A-CDK2 kinase (final specific activity 98.2 pmol/20 min/18 μl) to cyclin A-depleted extracts. The kinase activity of cyclin A-depleted extracts is 10.3 pmol/20 min/18 μl. The addition of kinase activity that fully restores replication is less than the activity measured in control extracts (240 pmol/20 min/18 μl). These results indicate that replication can be fully reconstituted by kinase activity that is substantially below control levels. We also tested whether purified GST-cyclin A alone could rescue DNA replication activity of cyclin A-depleted cell extracts. Fig. 4A shows that the inhibition of DNA replication was fully rescued by addition of cyclin A at a concentration of 80 nM. Furthermore, the addition of cyclin A to cell extracts depleted of cyclin A restores cyclin A associated H-1 kinase activity (Fig. 4B). DNA replication in cyclin A-depleted extracts is fully restored by kina"

We have investigated the existence of another protein, PtlI, encoded by a putative gene located between ptlD and ptlE. A B. pertussis strain expressing a ptlI::phoA translational fusion possessed alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting that ptlI encodes a protein. In B. pertussis, a protein with an apparent molecular weight of ∼5,200 (similar to that predicted by the ptlI sequence) was immunoreactive with an antibody raised to a PtlI-maltose-binding protein fusion protein. PtlE expression in a mutant sustaining an in-frame deletion in ptlI indicated that ptlE starts further downstream than initially predicted. PtlF, not detected in the ptlI deletion mutant, was restored partially by expressing ptlI in trans. A 36-kDa species, consistent with a PtlI-PtlF complex, was immunoreactive with antibodies to PtlI and PtlF in nonreduced cell extracts of a Bordetella bronchiseptica strain which overexpresses the Ptl proteins. Upon dithiothreitol treatment, the 36-kDa species was diminished greatly or undetectable. In B. pertussis, PtlI and PtlF co-precipitated with antibody to PtlF.

INTRODUCTIONBordetella pertussis, the causative agent of the disease pertussis (whooping cough) produces and secretes several virulence factors, including pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin interrupts signal transduction in eukaryotic cells by ADP-ribosylating a family of GTP-binding regulatory proteins (1Katada T. Ui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3129-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). The importance of pertussis toxin in pathogenesis has been demonstrated in animal models, in which mutants of B. pertussis that lack pertussis toxin are less virulent than the wild-type organism (3Weiss A.A. Hewlett E.L. Myers G.A. Falkow S. J. Infect. Dis. 1984; 150: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Wild-type virulence also requires secretion of pertussis toxin, not just its production (4Weiss A.A. Goodwin M.S.M. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3757-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, pertussis vaccines containing inactivated pertussis toxin as the only B. pertussis-derived antigen have been shown to be effective in preventing pertussis disease in humans (5Ad Hoc Group for the Study of Pertussis Vaccines, (1988) Lancet, i, 955–960.Google Scholar, 6Trollfors B. Taranger J. Lagergard T. Lind L. Sundh V. Zackrisson G. Lowe C.U. Blackwelder W. Robbins J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).Pertussis toxin is composed of six subunits (S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 found in a 1:1:1:2:1 ratio) and has a molecular weight of 105,000 (7Locht C. Keith J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Nicosia A. Perugini M. Franzini C. Casagli M.C. Borri M.G. Antoni G. Almoni M. Neri P. Ratti G. Rappuoli R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4631-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 9Tamura M. Nogimori K. Murai S. Yajima M. Ito K. Katada T. Ui M. Ishii S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5516-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To be secreted, the toxin subunits must cross both the inner and outer membranes of B. pertussis. The ptl locus of the B. pertussis chromosome (Fig. 1), which encodes the Ptl proteins, recently has been shown to be critical for efficient secretion of pertussis toxin (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 11Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5350-5356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is currently known about the mechanistic details of pertussis toxin secretion or about the structural arrangement of the Ptl proteins.The ptl locus initially was thought to contain eight open reading frames, encoding PtlA through PtlH (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence for the existence of an additional ptl gene, ptlI (nucleotides 8192-8377), situated immediately downstream of ptlD, and for the existence of a PtlI-PtlF complex, providing the first description of a structural interaction between Ptl proteins.DISCUSSIONThe ptl region of the B. pertussis chromosome, which spans 9.5 kilobases and is located directly downstream from the pertussis toxin structural genes, previously was shown to be necessary for efficient secretion of pertussis toxin from the organism (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). When the region initially was identified, it was thought to contain eight ptl genes which are predicted to encode eight transport proteins, PtlA-PtlH (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 11Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5350-5356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results from this study provide evidence for the existence of a ninth gene in the ptl locus, which we have termed ptlI.The nucleotide sequence of ptlI is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular weight of 6,294. Possible cleavage of the N-terminal sequence, MIHAHSNARLLRWAILAIA, which moderately resembles a signal sequence (29Briggs M.S. Gierasch L.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 109-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), would result in a mature protein with a predicted molecular weight of 4,155, which contains two cysteine residues (Fig. 4). Several lines of evidence indicate that ptlI encodes a protein. First, B. pertussis expressing a ptlI::phoA gene fusion possessed alkaline phosphatase activity. Second, a protein with an apparent molecular weight of ∼5,200 was detected in B. pertussis by immunoblot using antibodies raised to a MBP-PtlI fusion protein. Third, ptlI expressed in trans from the lacZ promoter restored expression of PtlI in the ΔptlI mutant.Like each of the previously described ptl genes, ptlI is predicted to encode a protein homologous to one of the VirB proteins of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 30Covacci A. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The VirB proteins are involved in the transport of oncogenic T-DNA from A. tumefaciens to plant cells (31Kuldau G.A. de Vos G. Owen J. McCaffrey G. Zambryski P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 221: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Ward J.E. Akiyoshi D.E. Regier D. Datta A. Gordon M.P. Nester E.W. J. Biol.

PtlI exhibits homology with VirB7, the smallest of the VirB proteins, which has a predicted molecular weight of 5,930 (33Ward J.E. Akiyoshi D.E. Regier D. Datta A. Gordon M.P. Nester E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to other Ptl proteins, PtlI also exhibits homology with proteins involved in conjugal DNA transfer (35Pohlman R.F. Genetti H.D. Winans S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 36Winans S.C. Burns D.L. Christie P.J. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 64-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).The initiation site for ptlI overlaps the termination codon for the immediately upstream gene (ptlD) (Fig. 4), in a manner similar to that described for the ptlC and ptlF initiation codons (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although ptlE initially was predicted to begin after a 31-nucleotide intergenic region downstream of ptlD (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), our findings indicate that ptlE starts further downstream. If the previously assigned translational start site for ptlE was correct, one would expect no expression of PtlE in the ΔptlI mutant, since that methionine codon as well as the 26 nucleotides immediately upstream from that codon were deleted. However, in the ΔptlI mutant, PtlE was detected and had the same apparent molecular weight (30,000) as in the parent strain (Fig. 5), suggesting that initiation of translation occurred at the same site in both strains.The assignment of a translational initiation site for ptlE at nucleotide 8356 seems plausible, given the consistency of the resultant predicted molecular weight of PtlE (25Idigbe E.O. Parton R. Wardlaw A.C. J. Med. Microbiol. 1981; 14: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 993) and its apparent molecular weight (30,000) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. It seems less likely that ptlE would start at the next downstream in-frame methionine codon (i.e. at nucleotide 8533) (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which would result in a 19.5-kDa protein. Another possibility is that an initiation codon other than a methionine codon is used for ptlE. Of note also, is that upstream of nucleotide 8356, the predicted amino acid sequence of the originally assigned ptlE coding sequence exhibits little to no homology with VirB8 (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), whereas downstream of that site, 30% identity between PtlE and VirB8 is predicted.The reason for the diminished level of PtlE in the ΔptlI mutant is not known. Expressing ptlI in trans from the lacZ promoter did not increase the level of PtlE in the ΔptlI mutant (Fig. 5). In this regard, it is interesting to note that Berger and Christie (37Berger B.R. Christie P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 1994: 3646-3660Crossref Google Scholar) reported that in A. tumefaciens, cosynthesis of VirB7 and VirB8, which are the homologs of PtlI and PtlE, respectively, is required for complementation of a ΔvirB7 mutation. They postulated that a VirB7-VirB8 interaction may be facilitated by transcription of both genes from the same promoter (37Berger B.R. Christie P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 1994: 3646-3660Crossref Google Scholar). Further investigations are needed to determine whether PtlI and PtlE interact.Unlike PtlE, we were not able to detect PtlF in the ΔptlI mutant (Fig. 6). However, PtlF was partially restored by expressing ptlI in trans from the lacZ promoter (Fig. 6). These findings were consistent with the possibility of a PtlI-PtlF interaction, which also was supported biochemically, and suggested that this interaction stabilizes PtlF. Our findings on PtlF expression in the ΔptlI mutant parallel results recently reported by Berger and Christie (37Berger B.R. Christie P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 1994: 3646-3660Crossref Google Scholar) for the VirB system of A. tumefaciens. In an A. tumefaciens strain sustaining a deletion in virB7, VirB9 (PtlF homolog) could not be detected (37Berger B.R. Christie P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 1994: 3646-3660Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, expressing virB7 in trans in the ΔvirB7 mutant only partially restored VirB9 protein content (37Berger B.R. Christie P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 1994: 3646-3660Crossref Google Scholar).A striking finding was the migration of PtlF as three species under nonreducing SDS-PAGE, with the predominant species migrating at an apparent molecular weight of 36,000 (Fig. 7). Because PtlF contains only one cysteine (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) these bands could not be explained by altered migration of PtlF due to intramolecular disulfide bonds. Since a possible PtlI-PtlF interaction was suggested by our genetic analysis, we explored the possibility that the 36-kDa species represented a PtlI-PtlF complex. A 36-kDa species immunoreactive with the antibody raised to the MBP-PtlI fusion protein also was detected in nonreduced cell extracts of BB55(pSZH5), a B. bronchiseptica strain containing a plasmid into which the entire ptx-ptl region of B. pertussis had been inserted (18Hausman S.Z. Cherry J.D. Heininger U. Wirsing von König C.H. Burns D.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4020-4026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and which expresses high levels of the Ptl proteins (Fig. 8). As would be expected for Ptl proteins, the 36-kDa species was absent in the parent B. bronchiseptica strain and in modulated BB55(pSZH5) (Fig. 8). The detection of this 36-kDa species in nonreduced cell extracts of BB55(pSZH5) that were probed with antibody to PtlF (Fig. 8) further suggested that it represented a PtlI-PtlF complex. Co-purification of PtlI, in addition to PtlF, by immunoprecipitation of the Sarkosyl-soluble membrane fraction of B. pertussis with antibody specific for PtlF (Fig. 9), indicated that PtlI and PtlF are structurally associated, and further supported that the 36-kDa species visualized in B. pertussis and Bb55(pSZH5) under nonreducing conditions represented a PtlI-PtlF complex.In contrast to the nonreduced cell extracts, the apparent absence or low level of the 36-kDa species in dithiothreitol-treated cell extracts of BP536 or Bb55(pSZH5) probed with either the PtlF or PtlI antibody (Fig. 8) suggested that this complex is stabilized by disulfide bond formation. Nucleotide sequence analysis predicts that the mature forms of PtlF and PtlI contain one and two cysteines, respectively. Possibilities include an intermolecular disulfide bond between PtlI and PtlF and/or intramolecular disulfide bonding in PtlI which stabilizes the PtlI-PtlF complex.Our biochemical evidence for a PtlI-PtlF complex provides the first description of an interaction between Ptl proteins. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the 60-kDa species that is immunoreactive with antibody specific for PtlF under nonreducing conditions, as well as to identify other potential Ptl protein interactions. Defining the structural arrangement of the Ptl proteins is critical to elucidate the specific steps involved in pertussis toxin secretion. Moreover, since the Ptl proteins share homology with several DNA transport systems (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

INTRODUCTIONBordetella pertussis, the causative agent of the disease pertussis (whooping cough) produces and secretes several virulence factors, including pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin interrupts signal transduction in eukaryotic cells by ADP-ribosylating a family of GTP-binding regulatory proteins (1Katada T. Ui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3129-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). The importance of pertussis toxin in pathogenesis has been demonstrated in animal models, in which mutants of B. pertussis that lack pertussis toxin are less virulent than the wild-type organism (3Weiss A.A. Hewlett E.L. Myers G.A. Falkow S. J. Infect. Dis. 1984; 150: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Wild-type virulence also requires secretion of pertussis toxin, not just its production (4Weiss A.A. Goodwin M.S.M. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3757-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, pertussis vaccines containing inactivated pertussis toxin as the only B. pertussis-derived antigen have been shown to be effective in preventing pertussis disease in humans (5Ad Hoc Group for the Study of Pertussis Vaccines, (1988) Lancet, i, 955–960.Google Scholar, 6Trollfors B. Taranger J. Lagergard T. Lind L. Sundh V. Zackrisson G. Lowe C.U. Blackwelder W. Robbins J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).Pertussis toxin is composed of six subunits (S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 found in a 1:1:1:2:1 ratio) and has a molecular weight of 105,000 (7Locht C. Keith J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Nicosia A. Perugini M. Franzini C. Casagli M.C. Borri M.G. Antoni G. Almoni M. Neri P. Ratti G. Rappuoli R. Proc.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5516-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To be secreted, the toxin subunits must cross both the inner and outer membranes of B. pertussis. The ptl locus of the B. pertussis chromosome (Fig. 1), which encodes the Ptl proteins, recently has been shown to be critical for efficient secretion of pertussis toxin (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 11Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5350-5356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is currently known about the mechanistic details of pertussis toxin secretion or about the structural arrangement of the Ptl proteins.The ptl locus initially was thought to contain eight open reading frames, encoding PtlA through PtlH (10Weiss A.A. Johnson F.D. Burns D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence for the existence of an additional ptl gene, ptlI (nucleotides 8192-8377), situated immediately downstream of ptlD, and for the existence of a PtlI-PtlF complex, providing the first description of a structural interaction between Ptl proteins."

It has been proposed that focal apo(a) accumulation in the transgenic mouse vessel wall causes the observed severe local inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activity and the consequent activation of the smooth muscle cells, which subsequently accumulate lipid to form lesions if the mice are fed a high fat diet. We show that blocking formation of these vascular lesions by two independent mechanisms, tamoxifen treatment and increasing high density lipoprotein, also abolishes apo(a) accumulation, inhibition of TGF-beta activity, and activation of smooth muscle cells. The data are consistent with a feedback mechanism in which an initial accumulation of apo(a) inhibits local TGF-beta activity, leading to further accumulation of apo(a). Breaking the feedback loop prevents smooth muscle cell activation and therefore lipid lesion development."
https://openalex.org/W2090380700,"MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinases are activated by a family of dual specificity kinases called Meks (MAP kinase/Erk kinase). Mek1 can be activated by Raf by phosphorylation on serine 218 and serine 222. Mutation of these sites to acidic residues leads to constitutively active Mek1 in some cases. When fibroblast lines were infected with high titer retroviral stocks carrying these Mek1 genes, the resultant transformation and morphological changes correlated with the kinase activity of the respective Mek1 enzymes. Although [Asp218]- and [Asp218,Asp222]Mek immunoprecipitated from clonal cell lines could phosphorylate kinase-inactive Erk1 equally well in vitro, the endogenous MAP kinase activity was 5-7-fold greater in [Asp218]Mek1-infected clonal lines, and did not correlate with the degree of transformation. Analysis of the Erk1 pathway revealed Raf-1 activation, which correlated qualitatively with the MAP kinase activity seen in the [Asp218]- and [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1-infected clonal cell lines. Expression of dominant negative Ras did not affect the elevated Raf-1 activity observed in these cells, however. These data suggest that Mek1 phosphorylation site mutants activate Raf-1 and MAP kinase by a Ras-independent pathway and that the mechanism by which transformation occurs may utilize pathways that are MAP kinase-independent.

The signaling pathways that lead to the activation of MAP kinases have been intensively studied in recent years. Some components of these pathways, such as Gip2, Ras, and Raf cause oncogenic transformation in their constitutively active forms, suggesting that the activation of the MAP kinase pathway may be responsible for accelerated growth in NIH 3T3 and Rat 1a cells (5Gallego C.

Infection of NIH 3T3 and Swiss 3T3 cells with these retroviral constructs demonstrated that the transformation potential of the Mek1 mutants is closely related to their kinase activity, although growth in soft agar did not correlate with MAP kinase activity. Further analysis of [Asp218]- and [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1-infected clonal lines revealed that Raf1 activity is elevated. The HindIII-XbaI fragments containing Mek1 mutants from pGMEKCglu (17Huang W.

The LC7ΔSX constructs were transfected into BOSC23 cells to produce retroviruses following the method of Pear et al. (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Briefly, BOSC23 cells were grown to subconfluence in selection medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS) (JRH Biosciences), 250 μg/ml xanthine, 2 mM glutamine, 1 × HAT supplement (Sigma), 25 μg/ml mycophenolic acid, 2 μg/ml aminopterin, 6 μg/ml thymidine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and plated on 6-cm dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/dish the day prior to transfection. Transfection was carried out by mixing equal volumes of HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.05) and 250 mM calcium chloride solution containing 10 μg of DNA. This mixture was then added to the BOSC23 cells, and they were incubated for 10 h at 37°C in DMEM, 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 μM chloroquine. The medium was then replaced with 4 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Supernatants containing retroviruses were collected 48 and 72 h post-transfection in 2.5-ml volumes. Cell lines were then infected as described below. NIH 3T3 and mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells were grown in DMEM, 10% calf serum (CS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Swiss 3T3 cells were grown in DMEM, 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Prior to infection, 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in a 6-cm plate and incubated for 24 h. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 h with a mixture of 0.5 ml of retrovirus, 0.5 ml of medium, 8 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma) and then grown for 48 h before they were subcultured and characterized. MEF cells were seeded at 5 × 103 cells on 3-cm plates 24 h prior to infection. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 h with 2 ml of retrovirus in the presence of 4 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide. MEFs were subcultured and characterized in the same manner as NIH 3T3 and Swiss 3T3 cells. Growth in soft agar was measured following the method of Cowley et al. (16Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). In brief, 6-cm plates were coated with 5 ml soft agar (20% 2 × DMEM, 10% serum, 50% DMEM, 20% 2.5% agar, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, melted and combined at 45°C). Duplicates of 1 × 105 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of medium, mixed with 1 ml of soft agar and added to each plate. Cells were fed weekly with 2 ml of a mixture of 33% medium and 67% soft agar. After 14 days, the number of colonies (with more than 20 cells) from 10 randomly selected areas of each plate was counted to calculate the number of colonies per plate and the efficiency of colony formation. To measure saturation density, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in a 6-cm plate and grown in 4-ml medium for 10 days. The number of cells in triplicate plates was counted on a Coulter Counter® ZM (Coulter Electronics Ltd.) Three days after retroviral infections, 5 × 105 cells were trypsinized and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 2 min. The cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold staining medium (Hank's balanced salt solution, 3% FBS, 0.05% sodium azide) and suspended in 50 μl of an anti-CD7 monoclonal antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (Sera Lab, VTR-144-5) (1:10 diluted in staining medium). The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, washed three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold staining medium, and suspended in 100 μl of fixing medium (Hank's balanced salt solution, 1% formaldehyde, 2% glucose, 0.05% sodium azide). The percentage of cells stained positive for CD7 was measured on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Clonal lines were established by picking colonies that had grown for 2-4 weeks in soft agar. The colonies were first placed in 96-well plates containing DMEM, 10% CS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and gradually expanded to 10-cm plates. Growth in soft agar was done as described above, except that 5 × 104 cells/6-cm dish were plated. The anti-EE monoclonal antibody, which reacts with the sequence used as an epitope tag, was a gift of G. Walter (21Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl.

The C-16 anti-Erk1 antibody, the C-12, and the C-20 anti-Raf1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-pan Ras Ab-3 was from Oncogene Science. Western blots were performed as described previously (17Huang W. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8960-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) using the C-16 anti-Erk1 antibody, the C-20 anti-Raf1 antibody, and the anti-pan Ras Ab-3 antibody. 20 μg of total RNA isolated from growing cells was separated on a 1% formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham). Filters were prehybridized with BEPS (1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 7% SDS) at 65 C for 20 min, then hybridized with a denatured MKP-1 probe (spanning nucleotides −140 to 870) at 65°C overnight. Filters were washed at 65°C, three times for 20 min each with 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1% SDS, dried, and exposed to film. Filters were stripped in boiling 0.1% SDS prior to reprobing with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. NIH 3T3 cells were lysed in PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride (Pefabloc® SC, Boehringer Mannheim), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A. Lysates were clarified at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, 5000-006). Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4°C in 1 ml of PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, using 1 μg of antibody, 10 μl (bed volume) of protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc.) and 500 μg of supernatant. Immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 and then incubated with 40 μl of kinase mixture for 10 min at 30°C. The Erk1 kinase mixture contained 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 3 mM magnesium acetate, 50 μM ATP, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM EGTA, 250 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, 0.025 mg/ml GST-Erk1(K63M) (a kinase-inactive Erk1 protein fused to glutathione S-transferase (10Alessandrini A. Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8200-8204Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase mixture contained 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 100 μM ATP, 0.125 mg/ml MBP, 25 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. Kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The kinase reaction mixtures were resolved by 10% (for Erk1 kinase assay) or 12.5% (for MBP kinase assay) SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). After autoradiography, the quantity of phosphate incorporated into substrate was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The quantity of kinase in the immunocomplex was measured by Western blot analyses. To test for Raf-1 activity, cells were lysed in potassium phosphate buffer (10 mM KPO4 (pH 7.05), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Brij-35). Lysates were clarified at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, catalog no. 5000-006). Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4°C in 0.5 ml using 1 μg of antibody, 30 μl (bed volume) of protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc.), and 400 μg of supernatant. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold potassium phosphate buffer and once with 1 ml of ice-cold ST (NaCl and Tris) buffer, then incubated with 40 μl kinase mixture for 30 min at 30°C. The Raf-1 assay included 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 100 μM ATP, 0.01 mg/ml Mek1(K97A) (kinase-inactive), 125 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. Kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The mixtures were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried down. Incorporation of 32P was detected by autoradiography. Cells were transfected with either pBabe puro vector alone, or with pBabe puro containing dominant-negative RasN17. Transfectants were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin. Clonal lines were picked, expanded, and further analyzed. Epitope-tagged Mek1 phosphorylation site mutants (17Huang W. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Open table in a new tab The expression of Mek1 in NIH 3T3 cells was examined by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against Mek1. The level of epitope-tagged Mek1 was 3-5-fold higher than that of endogenous Mek1 (Fig. 1A). To determine the specific activity of the Mek1 mutants, a monoclonal antibody against the epitope tag was used for immunoprecipitation, and the kinase activity in the immunocomplex was assayed using kinase-inactive Erk1 as substrate (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our data from COS-7 cells (15Huang W. Kessler D.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), both [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1 and [Asp218]Mek1 were highly activated, whereas [Glu218,Glu222]Mek1 was only marginally more active than wild type Mek1. The high infection rate of NIH 3T3 cells allowed us to directly characterize the general populations without cloning. The NIH 3T3 cells expressing the Mek1 mutants exhibited growth rates similar to those of control cells (uninfected cells and cells expressing wild type Mek1) under both 10% serum and 0.1% serum conditions (data not shown). 48 h after infection, the Mek1 mutants were already expressed at the levels shown in Fig. 1A. At this point the cells still showed no evidence of morphological transformation. Three to 5 days after infection with one passage, however, cells expressing [Asp218,Asp222] Mek1 or [Asp218]Mek1 began to show distinct morphological changes (Fig. 2). Cells expressing [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1 were visibly smaller than control cells and contained a large proportion of round, refractile cells; cells expressing [Asp218]Mek1 showed a similar morphology, but to a lesser extent. In contrast, cells expressing wild type Mek1, [Asp222]Mek1, or [Glu218,Glu222]Mek1 were morphologically indistinguishable from control cells. Moreover, when cells were grown to confluence, the saturation density of [Asp218,Asp222]- and [Asp218]-infected cells was more than three times higher than that of control cells; and that of [Glu218,Glu222]-infected cells was 1.8 times higher (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Saturation density of NIH 3T3 cells expressing Mek1 mutants.

Cell density is normalized to that of uninfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An important characteristic of transformed cells is anchorage-independent growth. NIH 3T3, Swiss 3T3, and MEF cells expressing the Mek1 mutants were tested for efficiency of colony formation in soft agar (Table I). Whereas MEF cells failed to form colonies, NIH 3T3 and Swiss 3T3 cell lines showed similar rates of growth in soft agar. [Asp218,Asp222]-infected cells exhibited the highest percentage of colony formation: 22.2% and 16.6% for NIH 3T3 and Swiss 3T3, respectively. [Asp218]-infected cells exhibited about 5% growth, and [Glu218,Glu222]-infected cells exhibited less than 1% growth. Cells expressing kinase-inactive Mek1 or [Asp222]Mek1 exhibited negligible growth; and control cells exhibited no growth in soft agar. Thus the capacity of anchorage-independent growth seems to correlate closely with the degree of Mek1 activation (Table I, Fig. 1B). It is possible that individual infected cells in the general population express Mek1 at significantly different levels, which would result in differential growth in soft agar. To address this concern, we isolated NIH 3T3 colonies that had grown in soft agar and examined their levels of Mek1 expression by Western blotting (Fig. 4). Without exception, the relative levels of epitope-tagged Mek1 to endogenous Mek1 in these clones were, for most parts, similar. Thus the ability of these clones to grow in soft agar was not due to an inordinately high level of Mek1. The clonal cell lines showed growth rates similar to those of the general populations from which they had been isolated (data not shown). When these clonal lines were tested for efficiency of colony formation in soft agar, however, the results (Table II) differed from those of the general populations (Table I). There was a significant variation in efficiency of colony formation between clones expressing the same Mek1 mutant. On average, the clones exhibited a higher percentage of growth in soft agar than the general populations.Table II.Growth in soft agar of NIH 3T3 and Swiss 3T3 clonal cell lines expressing Mek1NIH 3T3Swiss 3T3Mek1ColonyaPercentage of colony-forming cells after 14 days in soft agar.Mek1ColonybPercentage of colony-forming cells after 10 days in soft agar.%%Uninfected0.0Uninfected0.0DS22.2DS212.0DS47.8DS411.0DD143.0DD228.0DD325.0DD436.0EE129.0EE217.0EE328.0EE435.0a Percentage of colony-forming cells after 14 days in soft agar.b Percentage of colony-forming cells after 10 days in soft agar. Open table in a new tab Since Mek1 is an activator of MAP kinases, it would be expected that the expression of constitutively active Mek1 mutants should lead to activation of MAP kinases. Because both [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1 and [Asp218]Mek1 phosphorylate GST-Erk-1(K63M) equally as well in vitro (Fig. 1B), we analyzed the endogenous MAP kinase activity in the clonal lines. We found that the [Asp218]Mek1-infected clonal lines (DS2 and DS4) exhibited 4-8-fold greater Erk-1 activity than the [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1-infected clonal lines (DD1 and DD3) (Fig. 5C) and this activity did not correlate with the efficiency of growth in soft agar (Table II). To see if the MAP kinase-specific phosphatase (MKP-1) (22Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) may be involved in this apparent difference, we analyzed the levels of MKP-1 RNA. Our data show that there was no significant increase in message levels of MKP-1 in [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1-infected clonal lines as compared to [Asp218]Mek1-infected clonal lines. Furthermore, MKP-1 levels in all of the Mek-transformed lines were lower than in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 6). Therefore, the difference in MAP kinase activity cannot be attributed to an increase in MKP-1 in these clonal lines, though other phosphatases (23Sarcevic B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25075-25083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ward Y. Gupta S. Jensen P. Wartmann M. Davis R.J. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 367: 651-654Google Scholar, 25Zheng C.-F.

Northern analysis was performed using MKP-1 as a probe. The blot was reprobed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to check relative loading of total RNA.

Fig. 5A shows that Raf-1 activity is elevated in the clonal lines, and this activity qualitatively mirrors the Erk-1 kinase activity (Fig. 5C), in that the highest Raf-1 activity was observed in DS2 and DS4. Expression of dominant-negative RasN17 in these lines did not affect Raf-1 activity, suggesting that Raf-1 activation results from a Ras-independent pathway (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, these lines can tolerate high levels of RasN17 (Fig. 7A), suggesting that growth of these Mek-1-transformed cell lines can be compensated by Ras-independent pathways. As mentioned above, RasN17 was stably expressed in the Mek1-transformed lines using a puromycin-resistant vector. Both pooled transfectants and clonal lines were characterized. The pooled puromycin-resistant NIH 3T3 cells expressed very low levels of RasN17 (2-fold greater than endogenous Ras), while pooled puromycin-resistant v-Src 3T3 did not express detectable levels of RasN17 (Fig. 8A). However, the pooled [Asp218]Mek- and [Asp218,Asp222] Mek-transformed 3T3 stably expressed high levels of dominant-negative Ras, more than 20-fold greater levels than endogenous Ras. No reversion of transformation was observed in these pooled Mek1-transformed lines (data not shown). Ras activity has been shown to be required for v-Src transformation (26DeClue J.E. Zhang K. Redford P. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Nori M. Vogel U.S. Gibbs J.B. Weber M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2812-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but repeated attempts to stably express RasN17 in these pooled cells failed. Clonal cell lines were therefore established to determine if a small percentage of the RasN17-transfected v-Src-transformed cells unable to be detected in a pooled assay did express RasN17 (Fig. 8B); such cells could then serve as a positive control for RasN17 function in the cell. [Asp218]Mek, [Asp218,Asp222]Mek, and v-Src cells were therefore transfected with dominant negative RasN17, and puromycin-resistant colonies were isolated. Consistent with the RasN17 expression levels exhibited by the pooled transfectants, the number of drug-resistant colonies obtained from the [Asp218]Mek and [Asp218,Asp222]Mek was over an order of magnitude greater than the number of drug-resistant colonies obtained by transfection of the v-Src cells (only 6 out of 4 × 105 transfected). Furthermore, while greater than 50% of the drug resistant clones analyzed from transfection of the [Asp218]Mek and [Asp218,Asp222]Mek cells expressed the transfected cDNA, only 1 of the 6 v-Src drug-resistant clones expressed RasN17. Several clonal lines derived from RasN17-transfected [Asp218]Mek and [Asp218,Asp222]Mek were analyzed (Fig. 7A). Unlike the pooled cells, these lines did exhibit some slowed growth and a modest decrease in refractility, as well as partial inhibition of colony formation in soft agar (data not shown). However, the cells were still distinctly morphologically transformed, and were much more refractile than native NIH-3T3 (Fig. 9). Significantly, the single v-Src clone identified as expressing detecatable levels of RasN17 was severely morphologically reverted, exhibiting slowed growth and complete flattening of the cells (Fig. 9). In this report we show that activated Mek1 mutants lead to cellular transformation, but this process does not correlate with Erk activity (Table II, Fig. 5C). We also observe an increase in Raf1 activation in the [Asp218]Mek1-infected clonal lines that mirrors Erk activation (Fig. 5, A and C). Expression of dominant-negative Ras does not inhibit Raf1 activation (Fig. 7B), suggesting that this increase in activity occurs through a Ras-independent pathway. Although the [Asp218]Mek1-infected clonal lines expressing RasN17 show a slight reversion morphologically (Fig. 9), this does not correlate with Raf1 activity, which remains elevated. Furthermore, when we expressed RasN17 in v-Src- and [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1-transformed cells, we observed severe reversion of v-Src-expressing cells, and only slight reversion of [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1-expressing cells (Fig. 9). These data suggest that maintenance of transformation by Mek1 phosphorylation site mutants occurs through a Ras-independent pathway, and that the degree of transformation is independent of Raf1 and Erk1 activity. We have expressed Mek1 phosphorylation site mutants in NIH 3T3, Swiss 3T3, and MEF cells using a retroviral vector. Because of the high infection rate, we were able to directly analyze and characterize the general populations of NIH 3T3 cells without selection of transformed foci. The Mek1 phosphorylation site mutants [Glu218,Glu222]Mek1, [Asp218]Mek1, and [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1 had been previously shown to be 7-, 50-, and 80-fold, respectively, more active than wild type Mek1 as measured by their capacity to phosphorylate Erk1 (16Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). In soft agar growth assays, cells infected with these mutants had colony forming efficiencies of 0.2%, 5%, and 22%, respectively. The [Asp218]- and [Asp218,Asp222]-infected cells were morphologically distinct from control cells and reached a saturation density 3-fold greater than that of control cells. The [Glu218,Glu222]-infected cells were morphologically similar to control cells and reached a saturation density 1.8 fold greater than that of control cells. Overall, the transformation potentials of the Mek1 phosphorylation site mutants appeared to correlate with their kinase activities. There is, however, evidence that secondary events that promote transformation occur in these cells. We find for example significant variation in soft agar growth between the clones that were analyzed (Table II). There is also a striking increase in colony-forming efficiency of [Glu218,Glu222]Mek1 clones after they are picked from the initial population of infected cells (Table I., Table II.). Since the level of mutant Mek1 expression is the same in all [Glu218,Glu222]Mek1-infected clones and less than that in the initial [Glu218,Glu222] population (Fig. 4), other factors appear to contribute to the observed cloning efficiency and transformation (vide infra). The data reported here are relevant to earlier studies by others (16Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 19Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), in which transformed cells were analyzed after an initial selection by focus formation and an unspecified number of divisions. Our data suggest that the history of the cells analyzed and the contribution of the initial selection should be considered in the interpretation of Mek1 mutant transformation. Although Swiss 3T3 cells expressing Mek1 mutants showed properties similar to those of NIH 3T3 cells expressing Mek1 mutants, our soft agar growth assay indicates that MEF failed to be transformed by any of the constitutively active Mek1 mutants. This, however, is not surprising since primary embryo cells are known to be resistant to oncogenic transformation (28Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar, 29Ruley H.E. Nature. 1983; 304: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Because MAP kinases are direct downstream targets of Mek1, the activation of MAP kinases would be expected in cells expressing constitutively active Mek1 mutants. Among the Mek1 mutants that caused transformation, we found moderate activation of MAP kinases only in [Asp218]Mek1-infected NIH 3T3 cells. In the analysis of the clonal lines, we found that the [Asp218]Mek1 clones exhibited the highest level of MAP kinase activation yet yielded the lowest percentage of soft agar colonies (Table II). It is not clear, however, why MAP kinases were more active in [Asp218]-infected cells than in [Asp218,Asp222]-infected cells despite the fact that both Mek1 mutants have similar specific activities when immunoprecipitated and assayed on GST-Erk1(K63M) (Fig. 1 B). MKP-1 message levels are not elevated in the [Asp218]- or [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1-infected clonal lines compared to NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 6). Similar results were recently reported by others (30Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Yan M. Ahn N.G. Templeton D.J. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 639-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) using Mek1 N3-S222D. Whether other regulators of MAP kinase activity are involved in these cell lines remains to be determined. Our data show that Raf-1 kinase activity is elevated in the [Asp218]Mek1-transformed cells. Overexpression of dominant-negative Ras in these cells does not decrease Raf-1 activity (Fig. 7B), and therefore this activation occurs through a Ras-independent pathway. Mek1-activated GST-Erk1 could not stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity in vitro (data not shown). How Raf-1 is in fact activated in [Asp218]Mek1-transformed cells has yet to be determined. One can postulate that since [Asp218]Mek1 still has an unphosphorylated Ser222, it remains in a complex with Raf-1 until the mutant Mek1 is fully phosphorylated and activated; [Asp218,Asp222]Mek1 mimics a fully phosphorylated Mek1, and therefore does not remain complexed to Raf-1 for an extended period of time. It is possible that by maintaining a tighter association with Raf-1, [Asp218]Mek1 may place a factor or factors in close proximity to Raf-1, activating the kinase. We are currently trying to elucidate this phenomenon. It is noteworthy that the Mek-transformed lines are able to stably express high levels of dominant-negative RasN17. Most published work involving RasN17 expression has been performed in transient or inducible systems because it is likely that Ras function is necessary for cell growth. This implies that the cells transformed by activated Mek1 at least partially bypass a requirement of Ras for cell growth. This is not surprising, as Mek1 has been shown to function downstream of Ras in growth factor signaling (31Roberts T.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 534-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the modest change in phenotype of the clonal RasN17-expressing Mek1-transformed cell lines and the lack of correlation of Erk activity with transformation suggests that the steady-state system for maintaining cell growth and transformation is more complex than simple phosphorylation of Erk by activated Mek1. Since MAP kinase activity does not correlate with the efficiency of growth in soft agar, component(s) other than MAP kinases may be responsible for transducing the mitogenic signal downstream from Mek1 in these transformed cells. No Mek1 substrate other than MAP kinases has been identified to date. Transformation by oncogenic Ras has been shown to involve Rac, a pathway independent of the MAP kinase cascade (32Qiu R. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 33Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of MEKK1 in mammalian cells led to the constitutive activation of Mek1 and Mek2 but not of Erk2 (34Xu S. Robbins D. Frost J. Dang A. Lange-Carter C. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6808-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This suggests that these various Mek1 phosphorylation mutants may form complexes with distinct proteins and/or may localize to different parts of the cell where they would not normally be present. The elucidation of other pathway(s) involved in transformation by Mek1, together with the identification of new Mek1 substrates, will shed further light on our understanding of cell proliferation and differentiation.

The cultured human adult T-cell leukemia cell line, ED40515-N, expressed the message of α1→3 fucosyltransferase (Fuc-T) IV and VII, with a low level of the Fuc-T III and VI message, and manifested the sialyl Lewis X as well as Lewis X (Galβ1→4 [Fucα1→3]GlcNAcβ1→R) determinant at the cell surface. Transfection of this cell line with the pRc/CMV vector containing an antisense human Fuc-T VII construct (pRc/CMV/5′FT7AS) resulted in a significant decrease of endogenous Fuc-T VII message and a marked reduction in the cell surface expression of sialyl Lewis X determinant as well as a reduction in the enzymatic activity of α1→3 fucosyltransferase against sialylated type 2 chain substrate. This was accompanied by diminution of cell adhesive activity toward E-selectin on interleukin-1β-treated endothelial cells. These results indicated that the synthesis of the sialyl Lewis X determinants that were functionally active as E-selectin ligands was mainly mediated by Fuc-T VII in these lymphoid cells. On the other hand, the message of Fuc-T IV showed no significant change in the transfectant clones, and the surface expression of the Lewis X antigen as well as the enzymatic activity of α1→3 fucosyltransferase against non-sialylated type 2 chain substrate was well preserved. The clear contrast between the diminished expression of sialyl Lewis X and the conserved manifestation of Lewis X in the transfectant clones suggested that the synthesis of sialyl Lewis X and that of Lewis X are independently regulated by different fucosyltransferases in human lymphoid cells. Fuc-T VII must be involved in the synthesis of sialyl Lewis X, while the synthesis of Lewis X is mediated by an enzyme other than Fuc-T VII, most probably Fuc-T IV."

Moreover, the binding affinity of THZif-1 protein was 2-fold higher for the single-stranded 5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine derivative of NHE (ss c-myc NHE-me5C) than for the unmethylated NHE. In the case of the binding of THZif-1 to methylated double-stranded (ds) NHE (ds c-myc NHE-me5CG), no significant binding to the DNA was observed. The decrease in binding to DNA of THZif-1 was significant in the case of mutated ds c-myc NHE, in which more than two sites of deoxycytidine residues were methylated. However, the binding affinity of THZif-1 protein for methylated and for unmethylated triple-helical DNA of the NHE was almost identical. Moreover, the domain of the THZif-1 protein that made the major contribution to binding to ss c-myc NHE-C or ss c-myc NHE-me5C corresponded to the amino-terminal second zinc finger motif. Taken together, the results indicate that the THZif-1 protein exhibits preferential DNA-binding activity with ss c-myc NHE-C, ds c-myc NHE-CG, and ts c-myc NHE but not with ss c-myc NHE-G and ds c-myc NHE-me5CG in vitro."

INTRODUCTIONHuman epidermis is composed of layers of self-renewing keratinocytes that demonstrate remarkable versatility in responses to external environmental stimuli via complex programs of gene expression. Such complex genetic programs are largely triggered by cell surface receptor signal transduction cascades in the skin and mediate adaptive tissue functions, such as cellular proliferation in wound healing, expression of cytokines in inflammation, and apoptosis in response to a range of injurious stimuli. Cell surface receptors initiating such complex programs of gene expression are activated, in many cases, by a cross-linking of their cytoplasmic domains induced by extracellular binding of cognate ligand (1Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Such ligand-induced receptor oligomerization appears to be a general mechanism of activation for a variety of receptor gene families, including TNF 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorTNFRTNF receptorFKBPFK506 binding proteinIFNinterferonCATchoramphenicol acetyltransferase. receptor (TNFR) family proteins (2Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). TNF-α is among the earliest activated receptor ligands expressed in the skin following external injury, and the role of TNFR proteins in mediating complex programs of gene expression in response to cutaneous injury is becoming increasingly well appreciated (3Nickoloff B.J. Naidu Y. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1994; 30: 535-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).Fas is a TNFR member capable of triggering apoptosis and is induced in inflamed and infected human skin (4Sayama K. Yonehara S. Watanabe Y. Miki Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 330-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of Fas by the Fas ligand (5Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar) expressed on lymphoid cells triggers a form of cell death known as apoptosis. Apoptosis, triggered by Fas and a variety of other stimuli that include growth factor deprivation, detachment from extracellular matrix, and p53 activation, involves distinct ultrastructural and molecular alterations including chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage and collapse (6Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 479-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Keratinocyte apoptosis has been postulated to be involved in normal differentiation, hair bulb cycling, response to physical injury such as sunburn, and prevention of neoplasia, but a role for Fas in mediating these processes is currently not firmly established (7Haake A.R. Polakowska R.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 107-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expressed at low levels or not at all in normal human epidermis, Fas expression is dramatically enhanced on human keratinocytes in a number of inflammatory and infectious skin diseases (such as contact dermatitis and Herpesvirus infection) and in vitro in response to IFN-γ (4Sayama K. Yonehara S. Watanabe Y. Miki Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 330-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The settings in which Fas triggers apoptosis in human keratinocytes and the effects of growth factors, other cytokines, and developmental state on its function are yet to be firmly established. Although TNFRs exert effects that differ by target cell and ligand dose, a potential disparity of Fas effects in differing skin cell populations, as well as biologic differences due to magnitude of receptor activation, are also not fully characterized. Among the barriers to studying the TNF superfamily is the existence of cross-reacting ligands, often making confident assignment of roles difficult (2Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). Another barrier is the pleiotropic effects of cytokines such as TNF-α; they may exert opposing effects in two differing cell types (2Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar).We have pursued two approaches to triggering Fas oligomerization in order to determine features of Fas signal transduction in keratinocytes, cross-linking with a monoclonal antibody to full-length Fas and the FK1012 intracellular dimerizing agent for activating engineered Fas constructs. FK1012 is capable of cross-linking intracellular proteins engineered to contain the FK506 binding protein (FKBP); an FKBP-linked Fas cytoplasmic domain served as a confirmation of antibody effects as well as allowed initiation of features of Fas signal transduction in different subcellular locations. Here we present data indicating that Fas is active in normal human keratinocytes, that its downstream mediators require no induction, and that it dominantly overrides growth stimuli. Features of such a cell death signal transduction pathway in the epidermis may reveal a mechanism to eliminate injured keratinocytes in avoiding potential subsequent infectious and neoplastic complications in the skin.DISCUSSIONWhile apoptosis has been implicated in a variety of processes in the skin, the role of Fas in triggering this process is as yet not fully characterized. The prominent up-regulation of Fas expression in skin in infectious skin disease such as herpes simplex viral infection as well as in non-infectious inflammatory disease (4Sayama K. Yonehara S. Watanabe Y. Miki Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 330-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) suggests that, in situations of potential genotoxic injury or microbial infection, keratinocytes present infiltrating T lymphocytes with a rapid mechanism to eliminate suspect cells in the epidermis. Our studies suggest that the signal transduction machinery downstream of Fas may require no induction. This may indicate that the key control point of Fas-triggered apoptosis resides in receptor expression and oligomerization, implying a dramatic lack of the redundant checkpoints that prevent other biologically dangerous processes such as uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Such a lack of checkpoints would support the contention that it is more adaptive for multicellular organisms to readily eliminate infected or genetically injured epithelial cells than to risk microbial invasion or subsequent neoplastic transformation. We did not observe differences in Fas effectiveness to indicate that keratinocyte susceptibility to Fas-triggered cell death varies, as seen in hematopoietic and lymphoid cells (7Haake A.R. Polakowska R.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 107-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Taylor D.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The latter may be due to altered levels of molecules downstream of Fas oligomerization with impact on signal transduction outcomes, such as Bcl-2 family proteins and ICE.Recently, a number of downstream effectors of the TNFR family member signal transduction have been identified (11Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 12Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B.

Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar). The fact that none, unlike the case with growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, appear to require strict plasma membrane localization is consistent with our finding that engineered Fas, triggered in the cytoplasm, appears to trigger changes of apoptosis in keratinocytes. In summary, our data indicate that Fas oligomerization in normal human keratinocytes activates a signal transduction pathway leading to apoptosis and suggests that this pathway functions dominantly in these cells. Such a powerful cell death stimulus in the epidermis may underlay a strategic preference of multicellular organisms to eliminate infected or injured epithelial cells rather than risk microbial invasion or subsequent neoplastic transformation.

https://openalex.org/W1999392039,"In several instances, a monoclonal antibody raised against a receptor ligand has been claimed to mimic the ligand receptor. Thus, a specific monoclonal antibody (Mα2-3) raised against a short-chain toxin from snake was proposed to mimic the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) (1Trémeau O. Boulain J.-C. Couderc J. Fromageot P. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Further confirming this mimicry, we show that (i) like AChR, Mα2-3 elicits anti-AChR antibodies, which in turn elicit anti-toxin antibodies; and (ii) the region 106-122 of the α-chain of AChR shares 66% primary structure identity with complementarity-determining regions of Mα2-3. Also, a mutational analysis of erabutoxin a reveals that the epitope recognized by Mα2-3 consists of 10 residues, distributed within the three toxin loops. Eight of these residues also belong to the 10-residue epitope recognized by AChR, a result that offers an explanation as to the functional similarities between the receptor and the antibody. Strikingly, however, most of the residues common to the two epitopes contribute differentially to the energetic formation of the antibody-toxin and the receptor-toxin complexes. Together, the data suggest that the mimicry between AChR and Mα2-3 is partial only.

Antibodies are well recognized for their ability to bind foreign antigens and hence to inhibit their biological properties. However, recent methodological progress associated with the preparation and selection of immunoglobulins has revealed that antibodies can exert much more complex functions. Thus, catalytic antibodies, also called abzymes, are capable of transforming substrates (2Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Chemtracts: Org. Chem. 1990; 3: 1-36Google Scholar, 3Gibbs R.A. Posner B.A. Filpula D.R. Dodd S.W. Finkelman M.A.J. Lee T.K. Wroble S.W. Whitlow M. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, the abzymes possess catalytic groups whose spatial arrangements resemble those observed in enzyme structures (5Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 3: 113-118Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar), supporting the view that they might mimic enzymes. Antibodies are also capable of mimicking non-enzymatic antigens (6Poljak R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1599-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and in particular receptors (7Davis S.J. Schockmel G.A. Somoza C. Buck D.W. Healey D.G. Rieber E.P. Reiter C. Williams A.F. Nature. 1992; 358: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Amati V. Werge T.M. Cattaneo A. Tramontano A. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, our understanding as to the molecular basis associated with the concept of mimicry between antibodies and receptors remains obscure and has even been questioned (7Davis S.J. Schockmel G.A. Somoza C. Buck D.W. Healey D.G. Rieber E.P. Reiter C. Williams A.F. Nature. 1992; 358: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Amati V. Werge T.M. Cattaneo A. Tramontano A.

Nature. 1995; 374: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The goal of this paper is to shed further light on this concept, which is anticipated to have numerous implications, including the use of receptor-mimicking antibodies as molecular decoys for diagnosis or therapeutical purposes. Understanding of the molecular analogies and differences between a receptor and a receptor-mimicking antibody requires the elucidation and comparison of the molecular contacts that are established between each of these different entities and a common ligand. As judged from x-ray studies, protein-protein interactions involve multiple contact points. The buried surface area currently ranges around 1600 ± 350 Å2 with 15 or more interacting residues in each (10Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Davies D.R. Padlan E.A. Sheriff S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 459-473Crossref Scopus (693) Google Scholar). However, free energy calculations suggested that only a subset of the observed contacts contributes actively to the binding (12Novotny J. Bruccoleri R.E. Saul F.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4735-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In agreement with this view, mutational analyses of contacting areas in antibody-antigen or receptor-hormone complexes demonstrated the critical role of few residues only (13Kelley R.F. O'Connell M.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6828-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 14Clakson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). The present paper aims at comparing the amino acids of a ligand that are recognized by its receptor and a receptor-mimicking antibody. The ligand chosen for the study is erabutoxin a (Ea), 1The abbreviations used are: Eaerabutoxin aAcHRacetylcholine receptorCDRcomplementarity-determining regionABantibodyEb and Ectwo natural mutants of Ea. a short-chain curaremimetic toxin from sea snake venom. It is a small protein that recognizes the peripheral nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) with high affinity (Kd = 0.07 nM), provoking flaccid paralysis (15Chang C.C. Lee C.-Y. Snake Venoms: Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1979: 309-376Google Scholar) and death as a result of respiratory failure. AChR is a ligand-gated ion channel with four different subunits assembled in the molar stoichiometry α2βγδ (16Changeux J.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 485-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Devillers-Thiéry A. Galzi J.L. Eiselé J.L. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The site by which the toxin binds to AChR has been previously identified, on the basis of mutational analyses (18Hervé M. Pillet L. Humbert P. Trémeau O. Ducancel F. Hirth C. Ménez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Pillet L. Trémeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P.

Boulain J.-C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9362-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This site includes at least 10 residues, among which 4 amino acids seem to play a predominant binding role. The monoclonal antibody that is considered in the present study is Mα2-3, which recognizes the toxin with high affinity (Kd = 1.4 nM). Preliminary studies based on the use of chemically modified toxin derivatives revealed that three toxin residues involved in the recognition of Mα2-3 were also implicated in the AChR binding site, indicating that the determinants recognized by AChR and Mα2-3 do overlap (1Trémeau O. Boulain J.-C. Couderc J. Fromageot P. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that Mα2-3 may mimic AChR. erabutoxin a acetylcholine receptor complementarity-determining region antibody two natural mutants of Ea. The goal of this work is 3-fold. First, we further investigated the putative mimicry between Mα2-3 and AChR by searching for additional common functional and structural properties. Thus, we studied the capability of the antibody to bind various AChR ligands. Also, we investigated whether Mα2-3 can induce AChR-specific antibodies, as AChR does (21Fambrough D.N. Drachman D.B. Satyamurti S. Science. 1973; 182: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 22Patrick J. Lindstrom J. Science. 1973; 180: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 23Sugiyama H. Benda P. Meunier J.C. Changeux J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1973; 35: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This being the case, the anti-idiotypic antibodies were studied for their ability to induce, in turn, toxin-specific anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies. Finally, we searched for amino acid sequence similarities between the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of Mα2-3 and the α-subunit of AChR, as it sometimes occur between receptors and receptor-mimicking antibodies (8Amati V. Werge T.M. Cattaneo A. Tramontano A. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Second, having in hand data indicating functional and structural similarities between Mα2-3 and AChR, we delineated the epitope recognized by Mα2-3 on the surface of Ea, on the basis of a mutational approach, using a large set of toxin mutants. We then compared this epitope with the previously identified determinant recognized by AChR on the same toxin (20Trémeau O. Lemaire C. Drevet P. Pinkasfeld S. Ducancel F. Boulain J.-C. Ménez A. J.

Probes for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems model 381A synthesizer. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Muta-Gene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit from Bio-Rad. DNA technologies applied to Ea were performed as described previously (19Pillet L. Trémeau O.

Hybridoma cells producing the monoclonal antibody Mα2-3, were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum (35Hill B.L. Erlanger B.F. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2840-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A total RNA fraction was extracted from 2 × 108 hybridoma cells by an acidic solution containing 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNAs were purified over an affinity oligo(dT)-spun column (Pharmacia). A cDNA library was constructed using the SuperScript Plasmid System (pSPORT1 plasmid; Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the specifications of the supplier. Screening of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain cDNAs was performed using 5′end-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for Cγ2a (5′-GCCAAAACGACACCCCCATCTG-3′) and Cκ (5′-GTCTAGATTAACACTCATTTC(G/T)GTTGAA-3′) chains, deduced from Kabbat et al.

Selected cDNA clones were completely sequenced on both chains using the dideoxy chain termination method (38Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Then animals received the same dose following the same procedure every 2 weeks for up to 8 months. Rabbits were bled before the first immunization and then every week. Ab2 was purified following a two-step procedure according to Pillet et al. (39Pillet L. Charpentier I. Léonetti M. Ménez A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1138: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). First, rabbit antisera were chromatographed onto a mouse IgG column equilibrated in phosphate buffer, 0.01 M, pH 7.4, NaCl 0.15 M, as described previously (40Wang M.-W. Heap R.B. Taussig M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7098-7102Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) until complete disappearance of anti-normal mouse IgG activity. Effluents were collected, and the column was washed with 0.1 M glycine/HCl buffer, pH 2.4, NaCl 0.15 M to elute bound immunoglobulins. Effluents were chromatographed several times through the same column until disappearance of anti-normal mouse IgG activity. Second, the resulting solution was loaded on a Mα2-3-Sepharose 4B column in which the purified Mα2-3 was covalently coupled to Sepharose, using a ratio of 10 mg of antibody/g of gel. Buffers were identical to those indicated above. Anti-anti-idiotypic (Ab3) fraction was collected from rabbit sera by submitting them to affinity chromatography on a column with toxin α covalently linked to Sepharose. Identification of Ab2 and Ab3 fractions as well as determination of their binding properties were made according to the procedures previously described by Pillet et al. (39Pillet L. Charpentier I.

In the absence of structural data, mimicry between a receptor and an antibody is generally associated with the capacity of both proteins to recognize the same ligands (7Davis S.J. Schockmel G.A.

AChR is recognized by a variety of agonists, which cause an opening of the channel, resulting in a macroscopic current and hence to the depolarization of postsynaptic cells (44Galzi J.-L. Changeux J.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 554-565Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It is also recognized by a number of antagonists that maintain the channel in a closed state. Among the most potent antagonists are short-chain curaremimetic toxins from snakes (45Endo, T., Tamiya, N., Harvey, A. L., (ed) (1991) Snake Toxins, pp. 165–222, Pergamon Press, New York.Google Scholar). They are small proteins of 60-62 amino acids and 4 disulfides, which bind to AChR with high affinities, their apparent equilibrium dissociation constants currently ranging between 10−10 and 10−12 M (46Ménez A. Boulain J.-C. Bouet F. Couderc J. Faure G. Rousselet A. Trémeau O. Gatineau E. Fromageot P. J. Physiol... 1984; 79: 196-206Google Scholar). Previously, a toxin-specific monoclonal antibody (IgG2a/kappa isotype) was raised by immunizing mice with toxin α from Naja nigricollis and by screening antibodies with both toxin α and Ea, two short-chain toxins with little cross-reactivities toward their reciprocal polyclonal antisera (1Trémeau O. Boulain J.-C. Couderc J. Fromageot P. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 47Ménez A. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 35-90Google Scholar). This antibody was named Mα2-3. Table I shows the relative affinities of various short-chain toxins toward both AChR and Mα2-3. Clearly, the antibody and the receptor recognize all these toxins, suggesting that they both bind to similar determinants. However, all toxins have similar high affinities for the receptor, with Kd values around 6-70 pM, whereas they display a wider range of affinities for the antibody, with Kd values ranging from 1 μM to 1.4 nM. These differences indicate that if the toxin determinants recognized by the antibody and the receptor are similar to each other they are unlikely to be identical. As a consequence, the complementary binding regions of the receptor and the antibody are also unlikely to be identical, excluding the possibility of a genuine mimicry between the two proteins. This conclusion is further supported by the observations that Mα2-3 failed to recognize any other antagonists of AChR, including long-chain curaremimetic toxins or curare alkaloids (1Trémeau O. Boulain J.-C. Couderc J. Fromageot P. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Table I.Relative affinities of various short-chain curaremimetic toxins from snakes for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptorHomologous short-chain curaremimetic toxinsApparent dissociation constants for Mα2-3 (Kd)Apparent dissociation constants for AChR (Kd)MMLaticauda semifasciata erabutoxin a1.4 × 10−97.0 × 10−11Laticauda semifasciata erabutoxin b or c2.0 × 10−94.0 × 10−11Naja nigricollis toxin α9.0 × 10−92.0 × 10−11Laticauda colubrina toxin d1.2 × 10−8NDaND, not determined.Naja naja oxiana toxin II1.4 × 10−7ND aND, not determined.Naja mossambica mossambica toxin I2.0 × 10−73.7 × 10−12Naja mossambica mossambica toxin III1.0 × 10−64.6 × 10−12Naja naja atra cobrotoxin1.5 × 10−66.0 × 10−12a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab It is well documented that AChR triggers, in various animals, the production of antibodies that are capable of (i) binding to AChR (48Vincent A. Trends Neurochem. Sci. 1983; : 249-251Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar), (ii) blocking access to ligands of AChR (49Chinchetru M.A. Marquez J. Garcia-Borron J.C. Richman D.P. Martinez-Carrion M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4222-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and (iii) inducing signs of myasthenia gravis (50Lindstrom J. Shelton D. Fuiji Y. Adv. Immunol. 1988; 42: 233-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we showed that a murine monoclonal antibody raised against the long-chain α-cobratoxin recognizes all other long-chain curaremimetic toxins (66-71 residues and 5 disulfides) and binds to an epitope that overlaps the site by which the toxin recognizes the receptor (39Pillet L. Charpentier I. Léonetti M. Ménez A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1138: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 51Charpentier I. Pillet L. Karlsson E. Couderc J. Ménez A. J. of Mol. Recogn. 1990; 3: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Strikingly, this antibody was capable of eliciting anti-AChR antibodies, which competed with long-chain toxins for binding to AChR. In turn, anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies were elicited and shown to neutralize these toxins (39Pillet L. Charpentier I. Léonetti M. Ménez A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1138: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We repeated the same experiments using purified Mα2-3, a murine short-chain toxin-specific monoclonal antibody. This antibody was injected into rabbits according to the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” After a period of 8 months and 16 injections, the sera were collected and purified by successive affinity chromatographies on columns of mouse IgGs and Mα2-3 covalently linked to Sepharose. The resulting antisera raised against Mα2-3 inhibited the binding of tritiated toxin to Mα2-3 (Fig. 1A) and to AChR (Fig. 1B), in dose-dependent manners. These inhibitions were not due to residual amounts of Mα2-3 since no murine antibody was detected in the purified antisera, as revealed using assays with anti-mouse antibodies. Moreover, the antisera could not precipitate the labeled toxin itself, indicating that the antisera raised against Mα2-3 acted in fact as a competitor of the labeled toxin for binding to Mα2-3 or to AChR. Additionally, non-immune antisera were unable to inhibit the binding of the labeled toxin to either the antibody or the receptor. In aggregate, these data suggest that Mα2-3 can elicit neutralizing anti-AChR antibodies, as AChR does (50Lindstrom J. Shelton D. Fuiji Y. Adv. Immunol. 1988; 42: 233-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). With the view to further investigate a possible mimicry between Mα2-3 and AChR, we studied the capacity of anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) to induce in the same rabbit, anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3) capable of recognizing the toxin. Immunizations were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting serum was tested for the presence of Ab3 by determining the capacity of the antisera to bind to toxin α from N. nigricollis coated on a 96-well plate. A substantial binding was revealed with goat anti-rabbit antibodies labeled with peroxidase (data not shown), whereas labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies failed to detect any binding (data not shown). Therefore, the antiserum that recognizes the coated toxin is from rabbit and not from mouse, excluding the possibility that contaminating Mα2-3 could be responsible for the observed binding. As shown in Fig. 2, this binding can be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the free toxin, with an IC50 of approximately 0.3 μM, further demonstrating the specificity of the binding. One may notice that the inhibition curve covers a range of toxin concentrations of nearly 4 orders of magnitude, suggesting a marked heterogeneity among the generated anti-anti-Id antibodies. In conclusion, therefore, Mα2-3 shares immunological properties with AChR since they are both capable of successively eliciting anti-AChR and anti-toxin polyclonal antiserum. To identify the residues that are involved in the antigen combining site of Mα2-3, we cloned the cDNAs encoding its two chains and determined their nucleotide sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two chains have been recently reported (52Tenette C. Ducancel F. Smith J.C. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 26: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As judged from the large number of known antigen-antibody complexes described by x-ray crystallography, the CDRs of the antibody provide the majority of contacts between an antibody-combining site and its complementary epitope, although some contact residues may also be located within framework regions (53Braden B.C. Poljak R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the deduced primary sequences of CDR1L, −2L, and −3L from the κ light chain and CDR1H, −2H, and −3H of the VH domain of the γ2a heavy chain of Mα2-3, flanked by proximal frameworks residues. Fig. 3B shows a comparison of these CDRs with the amino acid sequences of the region 100-128 of the α-subunit of AChR from mouse (54Boulter J. Luyten W. Evans K. Mason P. Ballivet M. Goldman D. Stengelin S. Martin G. Heinemann S. Patrick J. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and electric ray fish (55Noda M. Takashi H. Tanabe T. Toyasato M. Furutani Y. Hirose T. Asai M. Inayama S. Miyata T. Numa S. Nature. 1982; 299: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Clearly the CDRs and the region 100-128 of the receptor α-chain share amino acid sequence similarities. Particularly striking is the strong analogy found between residues 106-122 of AChR α-subunit and residues from CDR2H and −3H, with four and six identical amino acids and one conservative substitution, respectively. As indicated in the literature (56Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3165) Google Scholar), the CDR3H results predominantly from a combination between germline diversity (D) and junction (J) segments. In the case of Mα2-3, segments DF1 16-2 and JH2 have been selected. However, we noticed the presence of a doublet of leucine residues at positions 109 and 110 according to Fig. 3B numbering. Such an unexpected addition results from the imprecision of the joining between segments D and J during the assembly of the complete heavy variable domain. As a consequence, approximately 66% identity is observed along the 106-122 segment of AChR α-chain with the combined CDR3H, −2H, and −2L of Mα2-3. Clearly, therefore"

Internal amino acid sequences of purified CRHSP-28 were obtained following trypsin digestion and found to match with >95% identity the predicted amino acid sequence of a novel cDNA recently identified as being highly expressed in human breast carcinomas. Verification that this cDNA codes for human CRHSP-28 was demonstrated by the ability of antiserum raised against purified rat CRHSP-28 to recognize the recombinant human protein when expressed in bacteria. Furthermore, this antibody was found to specifically react with CRHSP-28 in rat acini following one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and underwent a marked acidic shift in mobility after cholecystokinin stimulation, a phenomenon indicative of an increase in its phosphorylation. CRHSP-28 is predicted to be extremely hydrophilic, is phosphorylated entirely on serine residues, and bears little homology to any known proteins. Finally, the distribution of the CRHSP-28 protein in various rat tissues revealed that although it was present at low levels in almost all tissues, it was most highly expressed in pancreas, followed by the gastric, intestinal, and colonic mucosa. In view of its relative abundance throughout the digestive system and its apparent regulation by calcium-mobilizing agents, this protein may provide valuable insight into the mechanism(s) of calcium signaling in these tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2004682603,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone consisting of an α and a β subunit that stimulates intracellular levels of cAMP via a G protein-coupled receptor. Herein we report the engineering and characterization of a novel molecule in which the receptor and its heterodimeric ligand were covalently linked in a single polypeptide chain. The hormone-receptor complex was expressed in cells transfected with this construct, but the cells were unable to bind significant amounts of exogenous hCG. However, cleavage of the hormone with a site-specific protease rendered the receptor accessible to exogenously added hormone. Cells transfected with the hCG-receptor construct contained elevated basal levels of cAMP; moreover, addition of hormone had no significant effect. These results are consistent with a strong and stable interaction between the single-chain hormone and its covalently linked receptor that results in a constitutively active complex."
https://openalex.org/W2098120364,"Sialic acids are typically found at the terminal position on vertebrate oligosaccharides. They are sometimes modified by an O-acetyl ester at the 9-position, potentially altering recognition of sialic acid by antibodies, lectins, and viruses. 9-O-Acetylation is known to be selectively expressed on gangliosides in melanoma cells and on N-linked chains in hepatocytes. Using a recently developed probe, we show here that in murine erythroleukemia cells, this modification is selectively expressed on another class of oligosaccharides, O-linked chains carried on cell surface sialomucins. These cells also express 9-O-acetylation on the ganglioside GD3, but this modification appears to be undetectable on the cell surface. Increasing cell density in culture is associated with a decrease in cell surface 9-O-acetylation of sialomucins. This change correlates with the spontaneous differentiation toward a mature erythroid phenotype. This down-regulation upon differentiation and entry into the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle is confirmed by differentiation-inducing agents. In contrast, cells arrested in G2/M by the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole show increased expression of cell surface 9-O-acetylated sialomucins (but not the 9-O-acetylated ganglioside). However, the microtubule stabilizer taxol does not induce this increase, showing that the nocodazole effect is independent of cell cycle stage. Indeed, direct analysis showed no correlation of 9-O-acetylation with cell cycle stage in rapidly growing cells, and shorter treatments with nocodazole also increased expression. Western blots of cell extracts confirmed that changes caused by differentiation and nocodazole are not due to redistribution of molecules from the cell surface. Indeed, following selective removal of 9-O-acetyl groups from the cell surface by a specific esterase, the recovery of expression is mediated by new synthesis rather than by redistribution from an internal pool. Thus, 9-O-acetylation on these sialomucins appears to be primarily regulated by the rate of synthesis, and the increase with nocodazole treatment is likely due to the inhibition of turnover of cell surface molecules. These data show that 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids in murine erythroleukemia cells is a highly regulated modification, being selectively expressed in a cell type-specific manner on certain classes of oligosaccharides and differentially regulated with regard to subcellular localization and to the state of cellular differentiation."

Our results demonstrate that the Golgi apparatus contains a kinase(s) that phosphorylates both apoB48 and apoB100 as well as 290- and 460-kDa proteins recognized by antibody to apoB. We refer to the latter proteins as apoB57 and apoB90, respectively. Phosphorylations in the presence of Triton X-100, which increases the permeability of the membranes, or alamethicin, an ionophore that facilitates transmembrane diffusion of ATP, indicate that the active site of the kinase is on the luminal side of the membranes. However, studies with EDTA and EGTA, which are inhibitory to the kinase, suggest binding sites for Mg2+ and perhaps Ca2+ on the cytosolic membrane face. Phosphorylation of apoB was not stimulated by cAMP nor inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor peptide (5-24), indicating that cAMP dependent protein kinase was not involved in the phosphorylation process. Sodium carbonate treatment of the phosphorylated fraction, which permits separation of membrane and luminal contents, revealed that phosphorylated apoB90 and apoB57 are associated primarily with the membrane, whereas phosphorylated apoB48 is found in luminal contents as well as with the membranes. Phosphorylated apoB100 was found primarily with the membrane fraction. No evidence was found for phosphorylation of apoB in rough endoplasmic reticulum fractions.

https://openalex.org/W2054911560,"The acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the motor synapse is a pentamer of homologous subunits with the composition α2βγδ. Owing to the circular arrangement of subunits that forms a central ion channel, each subunit interface contains contributions from opposite faces of each subunit, designated + and −. Common to all subunits of the AChR and members of its superfamily is a disulfide loop formed between cysteines 128 and 142 of the major extracellular domain. To gain insight into the structural contribution of the disulfide loop and its possible location, we mutated the invariant proline at position 136 to glycine (P136G) and examined subunit assembly. When introduced into any AChR subunit, P136G disrupted assembly by affecting the − face of the subunit, suggesting equivalent positioning of the loop in each subunit and localization to the − face. Also, the contribution of the loop in the overall assembly process differed for each subunit. In the β and γ subunits, P136G prevented assembly of higher order heteroligomers, whereas in the α and δ subunits, P136G prevented transport of assembled pentamers to the cell surface. The results demonstrate asymmetry in the contribution of the disulfide loop to formation of subunit interfaces, and that the loop in each subunit contributes at different stages of assembly. The acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the motor synapse is a pentamer of homologous subunits with the composition α2βγδ. Owing to the circular arrangement of subunits that forms a central ion channel, each subunit interface contains contributions from opposite faces of each subunit, designated + and −. Common to all subunits of the AChR and members of its superfamily is a disulfide loop formed between cysteines 128 and 142 of the major extracellular domain. To gain insight into the structural contribution of the disulfide loop and its possible location, we mutated the invariant proline at position 136 to glycine (P136G) and examined subunit assembly. When introduced into any AChR subunit, P136G disrupted assembly by affecting the − face of the subunit, suggesting equivalent positioning of the loop in each subunit and localization to the − face. Also, the contribution of the loop in the overall assembly process differed for each subunit. In the β and γ subunits, P136G prevented assembly of higher order heteroligomers, whereas in the α and δ subunits, P136G prevented transport of assembled pentamers to the cell surface. The results demonstrate asymmetry in the contribution of the disulfide loop to formation of subunit interfaces, and that the loop in each subunit contributes at different stages of assembly.

The acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 1The abbreviations used are: AChRacetylcholine receptorDMTdimethyl-d-tubocurarinemAbmonoclonal antibodyHEKhuman embryonic kidneyBTXbungarotoxin. at the motor synapse has served as a model for understanding the structure and function of the superfamily of neurotransmitter-operated channels. It is a pentamer of homologous subunits with the composition α2βγδ (1Numa S. Noda M. Takahashi H. Tanabe T. Toyosato M. Furutani Y. Kikyotani Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 48: 57-69Crossref Google Scholar). Studies from several laboratories have shown that the subunits are positioned equivalently within the pentamer such that each subunit interface contains contributions from opposite faces of the subunit (2Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), designated + and − in Fig. 1A.The most conserved structural domain in subunits of the AChR superfamily is a disulfide loop formed between cysteines 128 and 142 of the major extracellular domain of the subunit (Ref. 3Mishina M. Tobimatsu T. Imoto K. Tanaka K. Fujita Y. Fukuda K. Kurasaki M. Takahashi H. Morimoto Y. Hirose T. Nature. 1985; 313: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar and Fig. 1B). This conserved motif has attracted considerable attention, yet its structural contribution and functional significance remain unknown. The presence of an N-linked glycosylation site at position 141 indicates that Asn141, the adjacent Cys142, and the disulfide-linked Cys128 are at the surface of the subunit. Also, the loop lies between stretches of residues found to interact with cholinergic ligands, including residues 111-117 and 161-180, which contribute to the − face of the subunit (2Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 6285-6289Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Studies of exposure of the loop to antipeptide antibodies showed that the loop is not accessible to antibodies in intact cells or membrane fragments but that it becomes accessible following treatment with low concentrations of Triton X-100 (6Criado M. Sarin V. Fox J.L. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2839-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutation of cysteines α128 or α142 to serine or deletion of the loop abolishes α-bungarotoxin binding but does not prevent these mutant subunits from associating with the δ subunit (7Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Sumikawa K. Gehle V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6286-6290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); because the + face of the α subunit contributes to the α-δ interface, these findings suggest that the loop is not located on the + face of the subunit. Thus the available data indicate that the loop is flanked by residues that contribute to the − face of the subunit, that the disulfide-linked portion of the loop is located at the surface of the subunit, but that part of the loop is buried, perhaps at the subunit interface.To gain insight into the structural and functional significance of the disulfide loop and its possible location within the subunit, we mutated the invariant proline at position 136 to glycine (P136G) and examined the ability of mutant and wild type subunits to form stable associations. The results show that when incorporated into each of the four subunits, P136G disrupts subunit assembly through a specific effect on the − face of the subunit. Furthermore, the nature of the effect of P136G was subunit specific. In the β and γ subunits P136G blocked formation of higher order heteroligomers, whereas in the α and δ subunits P136G allowed formation of pentamers but prevented their expression on the cell surface. The overall results demonstrate asymmetry in the contribution of the disulfide loop to formation of subunit interfaces and suggest that the loop of each subunit contributes to forming the subunit interface at different stages of assembly.DISCUSSIONThe experiments described herein demonstrate asymmetry in the contribution of the conserved disulfide loop of each AChR subunit to assembly of mature AChR pentamers. By examining formation of each subunit interface, we found that mutation of the invariant proline at position 136 of the α, β, γ, and δ subunits affected subunit assembly through a structural disturbance of the − face of the subunit. We also found that association of subunits to form the δ-β, α-γ, and γ-α interfaces relies on an intact loop only in the subunit that contributes the − face. Thus at these three interfaces, the correct structure of the disulfide loop is required for the initial association of subunits to form a stable heteroligomer. Association of subunits to form the two remaining interfaces, β-α and α-δ, does not require an intact loop in either subunit of the pair. At these interfaces, αP136G or δP136G allows assembly of pentamers but blocks their transport to the cell surface; thus in the α and δ subunits the loop appears to be required in later steps of assembly, such as protein folding, which are necessary for transport of the assembled pentamer to the cell surface. The overall results demonstrate subunit-specific contributions of the disulfide loop to subunit oligomerization, as well as contributions to maturation of either the subunit or the oligomer.The effect of P136G on AChR assembly suggests that a portion of the disulfide loop is located at the subunit interface, where it contributes to the − face of the subunit. Although the perturbation caused by P136G could be either global or local, the following observations favor a local perturbation. First, mutation to glycine is a conservative substitution for proline, as both glycine and proline allow formation of β turns (17Rose G.D. Gierasch L.M. Smith J.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 1-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). Second, molecular-modeling simulations suggested that the disulfide loop is a rigid structure, and that replacing proline by alanine does not change the overall conformation of the disulfide-linked peptide backbone (18Cockcroft V.B. Osguthorpe D.J. Barnard E.A. Lunt G.G. Proteins. 1990; 8: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Third, we found that a series of mutations in the α subunit did not effect binding of the competitive ligand DMT, which senses the + face of the α subunit, indicating that the effect of the mutation does not propagate to the + face of the subunit. Fourth, we found that deletion of the entire disulfide loop from the α subunit (αΔ) does not prevent association with the β subunit, nor does it prevent binding of mAb 35, an antibody sensitive to the conformation of the α subunit (12Gullick W.J. Lindstrom J.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These observations with αΔ indicate that the disulfide loop is not essential for maintenance of the overall tertiary structure of the α subunit, suggesting that the loop is superficial rather than buried within the subunit. Blount and Merlie (7Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) also found that deletion of the loop from the α subunit did not prevent association with the δ subunit. Thus the effect of P136G is expected to be local, suggesting that the disulfide loop is located near the − face of the subunit.Our second major finding is that although the disulfide loop of each subunit is essential for assembly of the mature pentamer, the contribution of the loop in forming subunit interfaces depends on the interface in question. Such selectivity of interface formation is not likely to be encoded by the amino acid sequence of each loop, given the high degree of homology of the loops across subunits (see Fig. 1A), suggesting the existence of additional structures that confer selectivity. Our observation that α and β subunits associate even when the loop is deleted from the α subunit shows that structures distinct from the loop allow stable association of these two subunits. Structures underlying this additional type of association may contribute to the specificity of subunit association and thus to the sequential nature of subunit assembly (14Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the context of a sequential pathway of subunit assembly, our findings suggest that the disulfide loop is essential for two types of interactions. The first is oligomerization of subunits where in the γ and β subunits the loop is essential for establishing stable contacts with the α and δ subunits, respectively. The second is maturation, or perhaps subunit folding, where in the α and δ subunits the loop is not involved in forming stable contacts with the β and α subunits, respectively, but is required for formation of a pentamer with the correct structure for transport to the cell surface.

Differences in the nucleosomal structure, however, were found in the promoter upstream region proximal to a previously described DNase I-hypersensitive site I, at the P0 promoter, and at the P1 promoter and upstream thereof. In these regions nucleosomes were detected in differentiated but not undifferentiated HL60 cells. Similar patterns of nucleosomes as found for active and inactive c-myc genes in HL60 cells were found for active and inactive episomal c-myc genes in stably transfected B cell lines. In these cell lines three activation stages could be described for episomal c-myc constructs: (i) uninducible, (ii) inducible, and (iii) induced.

Activation of the proto-oncogene c-myc is consistently observed in a variety of tumors. Expression of c-myc has been shown to be regulated at the level of initiation, RNA elongation, RNA stability, and protein turnover. The gene is transcribed from three adjacent promoters P0, P1, and P2 and a fourth promoter, P3, in the first intron. RNA initiated at the promoter P2 usually contributes to 80-90% of total c-myc steady-state RNA in normal cells (1Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Adv.

Attempts to reconstitute c-myc regulation in transfected cell lines and transgenic mice carrying large fragments of the c-myc gene locus have been unsuccessful. The transfected or transgenic c-myc genes consistently turned out to be repressed and not inducible by stimuli that strongly induced the endogenous c-myc. This was surprising since most of the constructs displayed a bona fide chromatin structure when compared to the endogenous c-myc. The unresponsiveness of the exogeneous c-myc has been ascribed to a yet unidentified locus control/enhancer element of the c-myc gene locus which was missing on the constructs examined (35Lavenu A.

In this report we show that changes in the sensitivity to DNase I in c-myc chromatin are accompanied by a remodeling of the nucleosomal structure in the c-myc promoter region. HL60 is a promyelocytic cell line carrying an amplified c-myc gene (51Dalla Favera R. Wong-Staal F. Gallo R.C. Nature. 1982; 299: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Cell line RF266C3 was obtained by stable transfection of the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji with the construct RF261-4 (52Strobl L.J. Kohlhuber F. Mautner J. Polack A. Eick D.

Cell line MA76 was obtained by stable transfection of an Epstein-Barr virus immortalized lymphoblastoid B cell line with a c-myc construct lacking the Ig-κ 3′-enhancer. Cell line CJ40 was obtained by stable transfection of Raji cells with a c-myc construct containing the 23-kilobase EcoRI-XhoI 3′-fragment of the c-myc gene instead of the Ig-κ 3′ enhancer (57Mautner J.

HL60 cells were grown to a density of 8 × 105 cells ml−1 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and L-glutamine. For differentiation, HL60 cells were grown in the presence of 1.5% Me2SO for 5 days. Nuclei were isolated essentially according to a nuclear run-on protocol (28Eick D. Bornkamm G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8331-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Samples containing 2 × 107 nuclei in 200 μl of buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.05 mM EDTA) were incubated for increasing periods of times at room temperature with 3 units micrococcus nuclease (MNase) (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.5 M EDTA and DNA was purified. DNA samples were choosen for further analysis, where 5-10 and 20-30% of nucleosomal spacers had been cut by MNase. DNA was purified and examined by standard methods (58Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was digested with restriction enzymes under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). DNA fragments were separated in a 2% agarose gel, treated with 0.4 N HCl for 15 min, denatured by alkali treatment (0.5 N NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl), and subsequently transferred to a nylon membrane by capillar transfer in alkali buffer. After transfer, the filters were gently washed with 5 × SSC (SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5), air-dried, and baked at 80°C for 2 h. Filters were prewashed in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.1 × SSC at 65°C for 1 h and subsequently prehybridized in Churchbuffer (7% SDS, 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.1) (59Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 65°C. Hybridization was carried out for 24 h in fresh Churchbuffer after addition of the DNA probe. DNA probes were multiprime labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. After hybridization, the filter were washed several times at 50°C in a solution of 2 × SSC, 1% SDS. Filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −80°C with intensifying screens. DNA probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction. The following primer pairs were used. Primer positions are given according to the sequence published by Gazin et al. (53Gazin C. Dupont D.D.S. Hampe A. Masson J.M. Martin P. Stehelin D. Galibert F. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Probe A: 111/136-292/315, probe B: 830/853-1153/1177, probe C: 1153/1177-1343/1367, probe D: 1865/1890-2041/2065, probe E: 2881/2905-3061/3085, and probe F: 3235/3260-3410/3435. Polymerase chain reaction fragments were multiprime labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used as hybridization probes. HL60 cells carry ∼20-30 copies of an amplified c-myc gene. The cells down-regulate c-myc transcription and undergo terminal differentiation toward granulocytes in the presence of 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) in the culture medium. Changes in chromatin structure accompanying down-regulation of c-myc in HL60 cells have been studied in detail with DNase I before (27Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Nature. 1986; 321: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 28Eick D. Bornkamm G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8331-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 48Dyson P.J.

Biol. 1988; 8: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The early phase of c-myc repression within the first hours occurs without significant changes in the chromatin structure, as revealed by the continuous presence of DNase I-hypersensitive sites I, II2, III1, III2, and III3. In the time course of differentiation c-myc chromatin becomes more resistant and after 5 days, sites II2, III1, and III2 disappear almost completely, while sites I and III3 remain unaffected (50Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Kelly K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). DNase I-hypersensitive sites have also been studied for stably transfected, episomal c-myc constructs in B cell lines. The episomal c-myc in MA76 cells (Fig. 1A) establishes a chromatin with hypersensitive sites similar to differentiated HL60 cells with undetectable sites II2, III1, and III2. In RF266C3 cells (Fig. 1B), the episomal c-myc establishes a chromatin similar to proliferating HL60 cells with sites I, II2, and III1-3 (52, 57; data not shown). The pattern of hypersensitive sites in CJ40 has not been studied before. The episomal c-myc constructs in MA76, RF266C3, and CJ40 cells are consistently found to be repressed (52, 60, data not shown). Sodium butyrate strongly induces the episomal c-myc in RF266C3 cells (52Strobl L.J. Kohlhuber F. Mautner J. Polack A. Eick D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1437-1447PubMed Google Scholar) but not in MA76 and CJ40 cells (data not shown). The sensitivity of chromatin to MNase can roughly be divided into three classes: insensitive, sensitive, and hypersensitive. While DNA packed in nucleosomes usually is insensitive to MNase digestion, the spacer sequence of approximately 20 bp length between nucleosomes is sensitive and gives rise to a nucleosomal ladder after partial MNase digest (Fig. 3G). MNase-hypersensitive chromatin contains either extended regions of nucleosome-free DNA or particular DNA structures that promote MNase attack. Nucleosomal ladders are interrupted at MNase-hypersensitive sites. To study the nucleosomal structure of c-myc in the various cell lines, nuclei were isolated and incubated with MNase for increasing periods of times. In the presented experiments three time points of these kinetics are shown: (i) untreated chromatin, chromatin treated with MNase until (ii) ∼5-10% or (iii) ∼20-30% of nucleosomal spacers had been cut. DNA was purified and fragments were separated on a 2% agarose gel (Fig. 3G, lanes 4-6), transferred to membrane filters and hybridized with various radioactively labeled small DNA probes homologous to sequences upstream and downstream of the P1/P2 promoter region (Fig. 2). Probes A-F detected nucleosomal ladders in all cell lines indicating the presence of nucleosomes upstream and downstream of the P1/P2 promoters, irrespective of the chromosomal or episomal status of c-myc (Figs. 3–7).Fig. 2Nucleosomal patterns upstream and downstream of the dual c-myc promoters P1/P2. The positions of recognition sites of restriction endonucleases and nucleosomal spacers correspond to the sequence published by Gazin et al. (53Gazin C. Dupont D.D.S. Hampe A. Masson J.M. Martin P. Stehelin D. Galibert F. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Positioned nucleosomes are numbered from 1 to 19. Dashed nucleosomes have not been identified in all cell lines investigated or only in some cell lines and in minor amounts. Positions of DNase I-hypersensitive sites HS I to III1-3 (47Siebenlist U.

DNA samples were cut with various restriction endonucleases as indicated in Fig. 2. Hybridization experiments were performed with DNA probes located immediately upstream or downstream of a restriction endonuclease cut site, allowing for a precise mapping of nucleosome positions. For convenience, the positions of individual nucleosomes determined in this study have been marked by consecutive numbers starting at the HindIII site (Fig. 2). A ladder of five nucleosomes (nucleosomes 14-18) was detected when DNA of HL60 cells was digested with XbaI and hybridized with probe F (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Accordingly, a ladder of three nucleosomes was detected after XmnI digestion and hybridization with probe E (Fig. 3F, lane 2). The observed interruption of the nucleosomal ladder proximal to the P2 promoter is in line with the detection of paused transcription complexes at this position in HL60 cells (30Krumm A. Meulia T. Brunvand M. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2201-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Strobl L.J. Eick D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3307-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Without XbaI digestion probe F detected at least seven nucleosomes indicating that the first exon and a large portion of the first intron of c-myc have a regular nucleosomal structure (Fig. 3A, lane 5). The pattern of nucleosomes downstream of the P2 promoter did not change in differentiated HL60 cells 5 days after addition of Me2SO (Fig. 3B). The episomal c-myc genes in cell lines MA76, RF266C3, and CJ40 revealed the same nucleosomal pattern downstream of the P2 promoter as detected in HL60 cells (Fig. 3, C-E). Again, the ladder was interrupted proximal to the P2 promoter consistent with the pausing of pol II complexes on episomal constructs in RF266C3 cells (34Wolf D.A. Strobl L.J. Pullner A. Eick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3373-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 52Strobl L.J. Kohlhuber F. Mautner J. Polack A. Eick D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1437-1447PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter proximal pausing of pol II in MA76 and CJ40 cells is currently under investigation. Activation of paused transcription complexes by sodium butyrate in RF266C3 cells (52Strobl L.J. Kohlhuber F. Mautner J. Polack A. Eick D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1437-1447PubMed Google Scholar) did not affect the nucleosomal pattern downstream of the P2 promoter (data not shown). The upstream region of an active/induced c-myc gene is characterized by the presence of DNase I-hypersensitive sites I, II2, and III1-3 (Fig. 2) (47Siebenlist U. Hennighausen L. Battey J. Leder P. Cell. 1984; 37: 381-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 50Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Kelly K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Site I has been mapped to position 450 relative to the HindIII site in the c-myc far upstream region. Probe A detected a ladder of >7 nucleosomes in DNA of HL60 cells (Fig. 4A, lane 5). Shortening of this ladder to two nucleosomes after HindIII restriction indicated a MNase-hypersensitive site downstream of nucleosome 2 (Fig. 4A, lane 2). This site was found to be hypersensitive to MNase in chromatin of episomal c-myc in MA76 and RF266C3 cells (Fig. 4, B and C), in CJ40 cells, in Me2SO-treated HL60 cells, and in RF266C3 cells after activation of c-myc by sodium butyrate (data not shown). The MNase-hypersensitive site matches exactly to the previously described DNase I-hypersensitive site I (Fig. 2). Probe B detected a ladder of >6 nucleosomes after hybridization to DNA of Me2SO-treated HL60 (Fig. 5B, lane 5). Cutting of the DNA with KpnI shortened the ladder to five nucleosomes (Fig. 5B, lane 2), confirming the MNase-hypersensitive site between nucleosomes 2 and 3 (Fig. 2). The nucleosomal pattern detected by probe B in untreated HL60 cells differed markedly. Digestion of the DNA with KpnI generated a ladder of four nucleosomes extending from nucleosome 7 to nucleosome 4 (Fig. 5A, lane 2), indicating the absence of nucleosome 3 from chromatin of proliferating HL60 cells. In addition, the spacer between nucleosomes 4 and 5 appeared almost entirely resistant to MNase-digestion in untreated HL60 cells (Fig. 5A, lane 2, open triangle). These peculiar differences in chromatin of untreated and Me2SO-treated HL60 cells were also observed for episomal c-myc in MA76 and RF266C3 cells. The nucleosomal pattern detected by probe B in MA76 cells was almost identical to the pattern in Me2SO-treated HL60 cells (Fig. 5C), whereas the nucleosomal pattern in RF266C3 cells was identical to the pattern in untreated HL60 cells (Fig. 5D). The pattern of nucleosomes upstream of HS II2 was studied with probe C. Probe C detected a ladder of three nucleosomes in uncut DNA of HL60 cells, which consists of nucleosomes 8, 7, and 6 (Fig. 6A, lane 5). The extension of this ladder to nucleosomes 5 and 4 is not clearly visible, probably due to the reduced sensitivity of MNase to the spacer region between nucleosomes 5 and 4 (open triangle) described above. Restriction of HL60 DNA with ClaI shortened the ladder to nucleosomes 8 and 7 and a small portion of nucleosome 6 (Fig. 6A, lane 2). This reveals a MNase-hypersensitive site downstream of nucleosome 8 near to DNase I-hypersensitive site II2. The hypersensitivity of this site may be explained by the absence of nucleosome 9 from chromatin of proliferating HL60 cells. This appears likely, since nucleosome 9 would cover the potential pol II entry site at promoter P0, and because P0 RNA is readily detectable in growing HL60. The pattern of nucleosomes detected by probe C in Me2SO-treated HL60 cells differed from the pattern detected in untreated cells. After ClaI restriction, probe C detected a nucleosomal ladder extending from nucleosome 7 to nucleosome 13 (Fig. 6B, lane 2). In contrast to uninduced HL60 cells, nucleosome 9 was clearly detectable in the chromatin of differentiated HL60 cells. Evidence for the presence of nucleosome 9 was also found for the episomal c-myc in MA76 cells (Fig. 6C, lane 2) but not for the episomal c-myc in RF266C3 cells (Fig. 6D, lane 2). Hybridization with probe D confirmed the reduced sensitivity of the P0 promoter region to MNase in differentiated HL60 cells. Probe D detected a large nucleosomal ladder in uncut DNA (Fig. 7B, lane 5). This ladder was shortened to 4 nucleosomes after restriction with AccI (lane 2), indicating an interruption in the ladder downstream of nucleosome 13. Nucleosome 12 was only faintly visible in the nucleosomal ladder possibly due to a reduced sensitivity of the spacer region between nucleosome 12 and 13 to MNase (Fig. 7B, lane 2, open triangle). While nucleosome 13 was clearly visible in chromatin of differentiated HL60 cells, this nucleosome was detectable only in minor amounts in chromatin of proliferating HL60 cells (Fig. 7A, lane 2, submolar amounts of nucleosomes are indicated by dashed lines). Nucleosomes 12 and 13 were also barely detectable in chromatin of episomal c-myc in RF266C3 cells (Fig. 7D, lane 2) but clearly visible in chromatin of episomal c-myc in MA76 cells (Fig. 7C, lane 2). The absence of nucleosomes 12 and 13 from chromatin of RF266C3 cells was confirmed after restriction of DNA with PstI and hybridization with probe D. Probe D detected nucleosome 11 proximal to the PstI site but did not detect nucleosomes 12 and 13 further downstream (Fig. 7E, lane 2). Thus, the presence and absence of hypersensitive sites III1 and III2 in c-myc chromatin of HL60 cells reported previously correlates with the presence and absence of nucleosomes 12 and 13. Importantly, the cap site of the P2 promoter and adjacent sequences were never found in nucleosomal configuration, irrespective of the chromosomal or episomal status of c-myc and irrespective of whether c-myc was expressed or not. A summary of the different nucleosomal structures found in HL60, MA76, RF266C3, and CJ40 cells is shown in Fig. 8. In addition to the interruptions of the nucleosomal ladder in the c-myc promoter region described above, we were able to define a further characteristic feature of c-myc chromatin. Several nucleosomal spacer regions with reduced sensitivity to MNase were observed. One potential spacer region with reduced sensitivity was detected between nucleosomes 12 and 13 in HL60 and MA76 cells (Figs. 6, B and C, and 7, A-C, open triangles). Since this spacer never displayed a regular sensitivity to MNase, it remains questionable whether the insensitivity to MNase is in fact brought about by cellular factors binding to the potential spacer region. Alternatively, the P1 promoter upstream region may contain a chromatin free of nucleosomal structure. The second spacer region resistant to MNase digestion was detected between nucleosomes 4 and 5. Interestingly, this spacer was only protected in proliferating HL60 cells and on episomal c-myc in RF266C3 cells (Fig. 5, A and D, lane 2, open triangle), but showed normal sensitivity toward MNase in Me2SO-treated HL60 cells and in MA76 cells (Fig. 5, B and C, lane 2). The reduced accessibility of the spacer to MNase correlates with the expression and inducibility of c-myc in HL60 and RF266C3 cells, respectively. The nucleosomal structure of chromosomal and episomal c-myc promoter regions was delineated by indirect end label mapping of sites accessible to MNase. By this method nucleosomes were mapped in relation to the various transcriptional start sites and DNase I-hypersensitive sites in chromatin of active and inactive c-myc genes. Starting with nucleosome 1 adjacent to the HindIII site (+1), 18 nucleosomes were mapped down to the XbaI site (+3508) in the first intron of c-myc. Additionally, a nucleosome-free region of ∼180 bp was detected at the P2 promoter. By estimating the sequence required for a single nucleosome and a spacer region of ∼180 bp, the calculated number of nucleosomes that maximally can bind the region correspond exactly to the number of nucleosomes detected in this study. This implicates that most of the nucleosomal spacer regions should have a size of ∼20 bp. Thus, the observed changes in the nucleosomal structure rather reflect modulation or disruption than new positioning of nucleosomes. The sites of hypersensitivity to MNase in chromatin of a transcriptionally active c-myc in HL60 cells corresponded largely to those identified previously for DNase I (27Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Nature. 1986; 321: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 48Dyson P.J. Littlewood T.D. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2885-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 50Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Kelly K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The mapping of MNase-hypersensitive sites in this study now allows us to make more precise statements about the nature of DNase I-hypersensitive sites. The presence of HS I in chromatin of inactive c-myc alleles has previously been assumed as indicative for a negative regulatory role of this site in c-myc expression (47Siebenlist U. Hennighausen L. Battey J. Leder P. Cell. 1984; 37: 381-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that this site is also hypersensitive to MNase in the cell lines analyzed. In addition, this study has revealed differences downstream of site I in the chromatin of c-myc which remained uncovered by DNase I analyses. While a regular ladder of nucleosomes was detected downstream of site I in chromatin of MA76 and Me2SO-treated HL60 cells, this ladder was significantly altered in RF266C3, CJ40, and untreated HL60 cells. Two major alterations were clearly visible: (i) cutting of the spacer between nucleosomes 4 and 5 was blocked, and (ii) nucleosome 3 appeared to be absent. A far upstream stimulating element has been described in c-myc that co-localizes with the spacer region between nucleosomes 4 and 5 (24Avigan M.I. Strober B. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18538-18545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This element displays single-stranded conformation and binding of the single-strand specific transcriptional activator FBP when c-myc is in an activated stage. However, the element is double stranded if c-myc is in an inactive stage (16Duncan R. Bazar L. Michelotti G. Tomonaga T. Krutzsch H. Avigan M. Levens D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 26Michelotti G.A. Michelotti E.F. Pullner A. Duncan R.C. Eick D. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2656-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Interestingly, c-myc and FBP RNA levels are co-regulated in HL60 cells and decrease with similar kinetics after induction of differentiation (20Bazar L. Harris V. Sunitha I. Hartmann D. Avigan M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2229-2238PubMed Google Scholar). Whether binding of FBP to the sense strand can inhibit MNase attack is not yet known. Changes in chromatin structure observed at the far upstream stimulating element site may be linked to the disruption of nucleosome 3 further upstream. In RF266C3, CJ40, and untreated HL60 cells the absence of nucleosome 3 and the resistance of the spacer region between nucleosomes 4 and 5 to MNase are observed, while in MA76 and Me2SO-treated HL60 cells neither of these two changes occur. Finally, the spacer region between nucleosomes 2 and 3 were found to be hypersensitive to MNase and DNase I in all cells. Thus, it is possible that this region may serve as a starting point for organization and remodeling of c-myc chromatin further downstream. The relevance of this site for c-myc regulation in vivo may have been underestimated in the past. Mutagenesis and reconstruction of the chromatin structure on episomal DNA constructs will help to study the role of this site for c-myc regulation. The potential entry sites for RNA polymerase II at the promoters P0, P1, and P2 were not occupied by nucleosomes in RF266C3, CJ40, and untreated HL60 cells. In contrast, the P0 and P1 promoters, but not the P2 promoter were occupied by nucleosomes in MA76 and Me2SO-treated HL60 cells. This points to different modes of repression for the different c-myc promoters. In fact, repression of promoters P1 and P2 have been reported to occur at different levels in terminally differentiating mouse erythroleukemia cells. While the P1 promoter is repressed at the level of initiation, repression of the P2 promoter occurs by promoter proximal pausing of pol II (61Kohlhuber F. Strobl L.J. Eick D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1099-1102PubMed Google Scholar). Repression of the P2 promoter in differentiating HL60 cells has also been reported to be mediated by promoter proximal pausing of pol II (30Krumm A. Meulia T. Brunvand M. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2201-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Strobl L.J. Eick D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3307-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The mechanism of P1 repression in these cells is not yet clear. The binding sites for the majority of potential c-myc transcription factors lie upstream of P1 in a region corresponding to nucleosomes 12 and 13. It will be necessary to study whether these factors can bind to nucleosomal DNA and, if so, whether factor binding affects the nucleosomal structure. Notably, DNA sequences encompassing DNase I-hypersensitive site II2 are evolutionary less conserved between man and mouse than sequences encompassing sites I and III1-3 (49Fahrlander P.D. Piechaczyk M. Marcu K.B. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3195-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since site I and III3 are still accessible to nuclease attack in chromatin of a transcriptionally silent c-myc gene, factors binding to these sites might be good candidates for the establishment of the nucleosomal pattern. The notion that the chromatin structure of the c-myc upstream region might reside in its intrinsic sequence is supported by the observation that a DNA fragment extending from positions +1 to +2395 turned out to establish all DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the absence of other c-myc sequences after stable transduction into HeLa cells via a vector derived from adenovirus-associated virus (62Kumar S.

https://openalex.org/W1991170822,"Heterotrimeric Go proteins have recently been described as regulators of vesicular traffic. The Goα gene encodes, by alternative splicing, two Goα polypeptides, Go1α and Go2α. By immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, we detected Go1α on the membrane of small intracellular vesicles in C6 glioma cells. After stable transfection of these cells, overexpression of Go1α but not Go2α was followed by a rise in the secretion of a serine protease inhibitor, protease nexin-1 (PN-1). This secretion was enhanced as a function of the amount of expressed Go1α. Metabolic cell labeling indicated that this increase in PN-1 secretion was not the result of an enhancement in PN-1 biosynthesis or a decrease in its uptake, but revealed a potential role of Go1α in the regulation of vesicular PN-1 trafficking. Furthermore, activators of Go proteins, mastoparan and a peptide derived from the amino terminus of the growth cone-associated protein GAP43, increased PN-1 secretion in parental and Go1α-overexpressing cells. Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of vesicular traffic, inhibited both basal and mastoparan-stimulated PN-1 secretions. These results indicate, that in C6 glioma cells, PN-1 secretion could be regulated by both Go1α expression and activation.

https://openalex.org/W1987955416,"TAL1/SCL is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) oncoprotein that is expressed in several cell lines including many hematolymphoid cells, but not in T- and B-lineage cells. The <i>TAL1</i> gene was originally discovered as being transcriptionally activated by chromosomal rearrangements in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here we have shown that TAL1 and the ubiquitously expressed murine bHLH transcription factor ALF1 formed heterodimers that, compared with ALF1 homodimers, had a more restricted E-box specificity and bound preferentially to the glucocorticoid-responsive E-box (E<sub>gre</sub>) motif (AACAGATGGT). Overexpression of the dominant inhibitory HLH protein Id1 in NIH3T3 cells reduced the transcriptional activity mediated by ALF1 homodimers, whereas the transcriptional activity mediated by TAL1/ALF1 heterodimers was resistant to Id overexpression. Our results show that ALF1 may serve as a dimerization partner for the bHLH oncoprotein TAL1 and form a complex with a distinctive DNA binding property. These findings support the hypothesis that the leukemic characteristics of the TAL1 oncoprotein could be mediated by activation of a set of target genes as heterodimeric complexes with ubiquitously expressed bHLH transcription factors such as ALF1 and that a principal role of TAL1 might be to neutralize an Id-mediated inactivation."

First, various mutagenized products were tested to learn whether they could rescue the decreased capacity of an fdxN-null strain MSA1 to fix nitrogen: the phenotype of MSA1 was reassessed to Nifs (slow growth by nitrogen fixation) from our previous description of Nif− (Saeki, K., Suetsugu, Y., Tokuda, K., Miyatake, Y., Young, D.

Gradual deletions and deletion-substitution of the 8 residues between Cys41 and Cys50 also yielded active products. Second, three of the modified FdxN proteins were subjected to purification. Only the GA protein, whose 8 residues between positions 42 and 49 were replaced by the Gly-Ala sequence, was purified. The GA protein and the authentic FdxN showed similar optical properties.

https://openalex.org/W2050811727,"Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of the peptide hormone vasopressin in which the N-terminal α-amino group has been removed and L-arginine in position 8 has been replaced by D-arginine. Using 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we show that desmopressin binds to neurophysin-II, whereas deamino-vasopressin does not bind. Thus, the change in configuration at Arg8 causes a significant difference in the binding of these hormones to neurophysin-II. We have determined the structure of desmopressin bound to neurophysin-II using two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance-transferred nuclear Overhauser effect techniques. A common binding motif for vasopressin and desmopressin is proposed that includes a positive charge group along with the hydrophobic surface formed by the side chains of Tyr2 and a β-methylene provided by Phe-3. In vasopressin, the positive charge is provided by the N-terminal NH3+, whereas in desmopressin, the side chain of Arg-8 contributes the positive charge. The type II β-turn found in residues Cys6-Pro7-D-Arg8-Gly9 of the bound structure of desmopressin folds the Arg8 side chain back toward the disulfide-bond loop, which allows the positive charged side chain of Arg8 to participate in binding.

Such a type II β-turn is not found in deamino-vasopressin in the presence of neurophysin-II. Neurophysin is a carrier protein for the peptide hormones vasopressin and oxytocin. The neurophysin precursor is composed of both the peptide hormone and neurophysin connected by a tri-peptide Gly-Lys-Arg linker, which is processed into the hormone and mature neurophysin after packaging into neurosecretory granules. The processed hormone and neurophysin form a noncovalent complex that dissociates after dilution upon secretion into the blood (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar). The vasopressin/oxytocin-neurophysin complexes provide good model systems for the recognition and binding of flexible peptides by proteins (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar). The current view of the interaction in the hormone-neurophysin complexes suggests that the N-terminal α-amino group and residue Tyr2 play central roles (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar, 2Breslow E. Abroch L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the C-terminal three-residue tail in these hormones is not involved in binding (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar). This model is consistent with most known experimental results. For example, deamino-oxytocin fails to bind to neurophysin because its N-terminal α-amino group is replaced by a hydrogen (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar). Also, dipeptides or tripeptides related to the N-terminal sequence of these hormones bind to neurophysin with affinities only slightly weaker than the natural hormones (3Breslow E. Weis J. Menendez-Botet C.J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4644-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Whittaker B.A. Allewell N.M. Carlson J. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the complex between a dipeptide Phe-Tyr-NH2 with neurophysin-II largely confirms the current view of the interactions between hormones and neurophysin as deduced from spectroscopic and thermodynamic studies (5Chen L.Q.

More recently, the crystal structure of the oxytocin-neurophysin complex has been published, which again confirms the importance of the N-terminal NH3+ group and the aromatic side chain of Tyr2 for the binding of the peptide hormone oxytocin to neurophysin (7Rose J.P.

In the present study, transferred NOE and molecular modeling techniques have been used to study the desmopressin-neurophysin-II complex. Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin with specific antiduiretic activity and antibleeding activity (8Jost K. Brtnik F. Jost K. Lebl M. Brtnik F. CRC Handbook of Neurohypophyseal Hormone Analogs. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1987: 97-125Google Scholar). It interacts specifically with the vasopressin receptor subtype V2 (8Jost K. Brtnik F. Jost K. Lebl M. Brtnik F. CRC Handbook of Neurohypophyseal Hormone Analogs. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1987: 97-125Google Scholar). The specificity of its biological activity makes desmopressin one of the most important analogs of vasopressin for clinical applications (8Jost K. Brtnik F. Jost K. Lebl M. Brtnik F. CRC Handbook of Neurohypophyseal Hormone Analogs. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1987: 97-125Google Scholar). Desmopressin differs from vasopressin in two positions. The N-terminal α-amino group of vasopressin is replaced by a hydrogen (deamino-vasopressin), and the L-arginine at position 8 is replaced by D-arginine. Both desmopressin and deamino-vasopressin are not expected to bind to neurophysin because they lack an N-terminal α-amino group. However, using 1H-NMR transferred NOE techniques, we demonstrate herein that desmopressin does indeed bind to neurophysin-II. The structure of desmopressin bound to bovine neurophysin-II has been generated based on distance restraints derived from two-dimensional 1H-NMR transferred NOE data. Based on this structure, a binding motif is proposed for desmopressin that indicates a critical and novel role of the C-terminal three-residue tail of desmopressin. This binding motif suggests new probabilities for interactions within hormone-neurophysin complexes. Desmopressin and deamino-vasopressin were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis method and was purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (11Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1995; 45: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Pure bovine neurophysin-II was isolated from acetone powder prepared from bovine posterior pituitary lobes and purified using methods reported previously (17Lord S.T. Breslow E. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1979; 13: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). NMR samples were prepared in 90% H2O/10% D2O, pH 5.7-5.8. Ten mM desmopressin or deamino-vasopressin with 0.5 and 1.0 mM neurophysin-II were used for transferred NOESY experiments. All NMR experiments were performed on a Varian VXR-500 NMR spectroscopy. NMR experiments were acquired at 5°C. Transferred NOESY (18Campbell A.P. Sykes B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) experiments were recorded with 50-, 100-, 150-, 200-, 250-, and 300-ms mixing times. The NOESY and two-dimensional rotating frame nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy experiments of free peptide sample (1-2 mM) was acquired with the 500-ms mixing time. The spectral widths were 6000 Hz in both dimensions, with 1024 complex points in the T2 dimension and 512-600 free induction decays in the T1 dimension. Presaturation was used for all NMR experiments for suppressing the water peak. Interproton distance restraints were obtained by the integration of the cross-peaks from a transferred NOESY spectrum at the 150-ms mixing time. Using the average reference distance of 2.50 Å for the β to δ protons of Phe3, the integrals of all cross-peaks were then converted into distance restraints. Four groups of distance restraints were obtained according to the peak intensities: very weak, weak, medium, and strong, which corresponded to the upper boundary of 6.0, 5.0, 3.5, and 2.7 Å. The lower boundaries of distance restraints were set to 1.8 Å for strong and medium transferred NOEs, to 2.3 Å for weak peaks, and to 2.8Å for very weak peaks. The appropriate distance corrections were made for aromatic ring protons and the pseudoatoms of non-stereospecifically assigned methylene protons to allow centroid averaging (19Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acid. Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). A total of 248 transferred NOE distance restraints were used, which included 88 intra-residue and 160 inter-residue distance restraints and 79 medium- and long-ranged distance restraints, in the structure generation procedure based on NOE distance restraints. In the first several iterations, only NOE distance restraints were used; in the later iterations, four hydrogen bond distance restraints were included into the calculations because the structures generated in the earlier iterations indicated that two hydrogen bonds existed. A total of 50 structures were generated in each iteration. Using transferred NOE data, the bound structure of desmopressin was generated by PEPFLEX-II, which is an iterative structure building procedure (12Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Wang J.J. Sonnichsen F.D. Byoko R. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 569-575Google Scholar), and includes a restrained simulated annealing and a full relaxation matrix analysis. The molecular modeling was achieved by using DISCOVER (BIOSYM, San Diego, CA) running on a Silicon Graphics 4D/240 computer. In all calculations, a cutoff distance of 8.0 Å was chosen; chiral restraints were used to retain right chiralities of all residues. Peptide bonds were also constrained into trans geometry. Charge interaction and all cross-term interactions were switched off during the simulation. Fig. 1 compares the amide-proton region of the one-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra of desmopressin as a function of the added fraction of bovine neurophysin-II (molar ratio). These spectra show line-broadening of the amide-proton peaks of desmopressin as a function of the concentration of neurophysin-II. No significant chemical shift changes were observed. 2The chemical shift assignment of desmopressin is reported in Ref. 12Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar. In these spectra, we assume that the free⇆bound peptide exchange is in the NMR fast exchange limit for both the NOE timescale and the chemical shift timescale because of the weak affinities involved (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar). An estimation of the binding constant of desmopressin to neurophysin-II is about 200 M−1, which is based on NMR experiments (line width versus neurophysin concentration) and competitive binding studies (data not shown). The line-broadening of amide-proton peaks indicates an interaction between the peptide and bovine neurophysin-II. The binding of desmopressin to neurophysin-II also induces new 1H-NMR transferred NOE cross-peaks. Fig. 2, A and B, compare the two-dimensional 1H-NMR transferred NOESY spectra of desmopressin in the presence of 0.1 added molar ratio of neurophysin-II with the two-dimensional 1H-NMR NOESY spectra of the peptide free in aqueous solution. Transferred NOEs develop upon binding to neurophysin-II, resulting in a larger number and more intense NOE cross-peaks at a 150-ms mixing time than those observed at a 500-ms mixing time in the absence of protein. 3The buildup curve of NOESY spectra of desmopressin in the absence of neurophysin-II was linear up to 300 ms, whereas that of transferred NOESY of desmopressin in presence of 0.1 added molar ratio of neurophysin-II was linear only up to 150 ms. Many of these new transferred NOE cross-peaks arise from side chain to side chain nuclei as indicated in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Side chain to side chain proton region of two-dimensional 1H-1H NOESY NMR spectrum of desmopressin in aqueous solution (A) with the same region of the transferred NOESY spectra of desmopressin (B) and deamino-vasopressin (C) in the presence of 0.1 added molar ratio of neurophysin-II. Transferred NOESY spectra were obtained at 5°C, pH 5.7-5.8, with a 150-ms mixing time for desmopressin and 250-ms mixing time for deamino-vasopressin. NOESY spectrum were obtained at 5°C, pH 5.7-5.8, with a 500-ms mixing time. The assignments are shown with the residue number.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have also used two-dimensional 1H-NMR transferred NOE techniques to study deamino-vasopressin. The transferred NOESY spectrum of deamino-vasopressin in the presence of 0.1 added molar ratio of neurophysin-II showed no significant differences from the NOESY spectrum of the free peptide (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows that no significant differences are observed between the NOESY spectrum of the desmopressin in the absence of neurophysin-II (Fig. 2A) and the transferred NOESY spectrum of deamino-vasopressin in the presence of 0.1 added molar ratio of neurophysin-II (Fig. 2C), indicating that there is no binding. Since the L/D difference in the configuration of Arg8 of desmopressin and deamino-vasopressin results in such a striking difference in their binding to neurophysin-II, a conformational difference in these two peptides might be expected. Fig. 3 shows the αH-NH regions of two-dimensional 1H-NMR NOESY spectrum of desmopressin in the absence of neurophysin-II (Fig. 3A) and the same region of transferred NOESY spectra of desmopressin (Fig. 3B) and deamino-vasopressin (Fig. 3C) in the presence of 0.1 added molar ratio of bovine neurophysin-II. Changes are observed in the NOEs that characterize the structure of residues 6-9; for example, the dαN(7, 9) cross-peak (marked by a box) is seen in Fig. 3A (weak intensity) and Fig. 3B (medium intensity) but not in Fig. 3C. In addition (data not shown), the dNN(8, 9) cross-peak is seen in the NH-NH region of NOESY (medium intensity) and transferred NOESY (strong intensity) spectra of desmopressin in the absence/presence of 0.1 added molar ratio of neurophysin-II, but is not seen in the transferred NOESY spectrum of deamino-vasopressin in the presence of 0.1 added molar ratio of neurophysin-II. These NOE results identify a β-turn in residues Cys6-Pro7-D-Arg8-Gly9 in both free and bound desmopressin. Evidence for such a structure is not found among the same residues of deamino-vasopressin. While the NOEs dαN(7, 9) and dNN(8, 9) characterize the existence of a β-turn in these residues, the 3JαH-NH coupling constant of 5.0-5.5 Hz for residue Arg8 of desmopressin indicates that this turn is a type II β-turn (9Wagner G. Neuhaus D. Worgotter E. Vasak M. Kagi J.H.R. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Actually, the sequence of Pro-D-Arg at positions i+1 and i+2 is known to favor a type II β-turn (10Wilmot C.M. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this type II β-turn was also found in the structures of desmopressin in both aqueous and trifluoroethanol solutions (11Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1995; 45: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows transferred NOEs from aromatic atoms of Tyr2 and Phe3 to the side chain β-CH2 and γ-CH2 atoms of residues of Arg8 and Gln4, as well as from β-CH2 atoms of Cys6 to the C-terminal NH2 atoms of Gly9. The NOEs from residue Arg8 to Tyr2 and Phe3 are surprising because they are not observed in either aqueous or TFE solutions or in the NOESY spectra of deamino-vasopressin in the presence of added molar ratio of neurophysin-II. Together with the transferred NOEs involving Cys6 to Gly9, these results indicate that the three residue C-terminal tail of desmopressin may be involved in binding to neurophysin-II. The bound structure of desmopressin to neurophysin-II has been generated using PEPFLEX-II (12Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which is a computer program for the generation of structure(s) of flexible peptides, based on transferred NOE NMR data. On the right of Fig. 4, we show 21 structures of desmopressin bound to neurophysin-II derived from 1H-NMR transferred NOE data; on the left, we show the averaged bound structure derived from these structures. There are two fused β-turns in the structure that are located between residues Phe3 and Gly9. One turn is a distorted type-I β-turn with residues Gln4 and Asn5 at the i+1 and i+2 positions; the other is a type-II β-turn with residues Pro7 and Arg8 at positions i+1 and i+2, respectively. Two hydrogen bonds were found in the bound structure. One is between the amide proton of residue Phe3 to the carbonyl oxygen atom of residue 6, and the other is between the amide proton of residue 6 to the carboxyl oxygen of residue 9. The bound structure of desmopressin is similar to one of the minor conformations of the peptide observed in aqueous solution (12Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of the bound structure is the change in the conformation of the side chains of residues Tyr2, Phe3, Gln4, and Arg8 that occurs upon binding to neurophysin-II. This suggests that the major interactions between desmopressin and neurophysin-II involve these side chains. Binding causes the positive charge on the side chain of Arg8 to be in close proximity of the side chains of Tyr2 or Phe3 and the disulfide-bonded loop (see the left structure of Fig. 4), suggesting that the C-terminal three-residue tail of desmopressin participates in the binding interactions. This is different from structure-function studies of vasopressin and other analogs, which indicate that the three-residue tail of these peptides is not involved in binding (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar). In the structures of the free peptide, the Tyr2 side chain is one of the least well-refined side chain, indicating its high flexibility when the peptide is in either TFE or aqueous solutions (11Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1995; 45: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The flexibility of the Tyr2 side chain of the peptide is significantly reduced in the bound structure, indicating a strong interaction between this side chain and neurophysin-II. However, the side chain of Phe3 in the bound structure retains a certain flexibility, implying a looser interaction between Phe3 and neurophysin-II. The strong interaction of the Tyr2 side chain and the weak interaction of the Phe3 side chain are analogous to interactions of vasopressin with neurophysin-II (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar). Our previous results indicated that the disulfide bond is one of the most flexible part of desmopressin; its flexibility causes several different orientations of the three-residue tail in both TFE (11Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1995; 45: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and aqueous solution (12Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The flexibility of the disulfide bond remains in the bound structure of desmopressin. However, unlike the disulfide bond of the peptide in the free solution structures (12Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), this is not coupled to different orientations of the C-terminal three-residue tail (Fig. 4). In this study, a large excess of peptide over neurophysin-II was used for the transferred NOE experiments to minimize the NMR signals from neurophysin-II. Such an excess may lead to nonspecific binding (13Lian L.Y. Barsukov M.J. Sutcliffe K.H.S. Roberts G.C.K. James T.L. Oppenheimer N.J. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 657-700Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that the interaction between desmopressin and neurophysin-II is specific compared to the control experiment, which demonstrated that deamino-vasopressin does not bind to neurophysin-II under the same experimental conditions. The current view of the binding mode between peptide hormones and neurophysin does not predict the binding of desmopressin to neurophysin (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar), because it lacks the N-terminal α-amino group, which plays a crucial role in the binding of natural hormones vasopressin and oxytocin to neurophysin (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar). This group forms a strong salt bridge with the side chain carboxyl group of residue Glu47 in neurophysin and hydrogen bonds to neurophysin-II backbone carbonyls of Glu47, Leu50, and Ser52 (5Chen L.Q. Rose J.P. Breslow E. Yang D. Chang W.R. Furey Jr., W.F. Sax M. Wang B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4240-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Removal of this N-terminal NH3+ causes the loss of the binding activity of oxytocin (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar), and a similar result is also seen in this paper for deamino-vasopressin. However, the acetimidation of this amino group does not change binding affinity or the binding-induced dimerization of the hormone-neurophysin complex (14Fassina G. Chaiken I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13539-13543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that a longer and more bulky positive charge on the acetimidated group can also form a strong salt bridge. Both desmopressin and deamino-vasopressin lack this N-terminal α-amino group. However, our NMR data indicate that although desmopressin binds to neurophysin-II, deamino-vasopressin does not. The only positive charge in desmopressin/deamino-vasopressin is that from the side chain of Arg8. Desmopressin has a D-arginine at position 8, and its three-residue tail forms a type II β-turn. This type II β-turn in desmopressin allows the three-residue tail to fold back to the disulfide-bonded moiety so that Arg8 is close to Tyr2, potentially permitting the positive charge on the Arg8 side chain to interact with neurophysin-II analogously to the α-amino group of the natural hormones. This interaction is not available to deamino-vasopressin because it has a L-arginine, and no β-turn has been found in its C-terminal three-residue tail. However, the distance between the Arg8 side chain and neurophysin-II may not be as close as that of the α-amino group in vasopressin. Also, the side chain of Arg8 is bulkier, even than the acetimidated amino group, and may necessitate conformational adjustments by the protein. These factors may influence the strength of the interaction between desmopressin and neurophysin-II and may, therefore, be responsible for a binding affinity difference between desmopressin and vasopressin. Another important interaction between the natural hormone and neurophysin-II is that the aromatic side chain of Tyr2 binds in a tight pocket with its hydroxyl group hydrogen bonded with neurophysin (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar). The bound structure of desmopressin supports this interaction, although we cannot determine whether the hydroxyl group of the Tyr2 side chain is hydrogen bonded with neurophysin-II. Although the side chain of Tyr2 is the most flexible side chain of the peptide in its free solution structures (11Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1995; 45: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the binding to neurophysin-II significantly reduces its flexibility. The bound structure also indicates a certain mobility for the aromatic side chain of Phe3. This is also consistent with earlier studies of hormone-neurophysin complexes, which indicated that the side chain of Phe3 binds to the protein principally via the β-methylene position (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar). Furthermore, thermodynamic studies indicate hydrogen-bonding between the hormone backbone of residue 2 and 3 to neurophysin (5Chen L.Q. Rose J.P. Breslow E. Yang D. Chang W.R. Furey Jr., W.F. Sax M. Wang B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4240-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 15Carlson J. Breslow E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), which was supported by 15N NMR spectroscopy study (16Live D.H. Cowburn D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6415-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the complex of Phe-Tyr-NH2 with neurophysin-II, the terminal amide NH of the peptide is hydrogen-bonded to the protein (5Chen L.Q. Rose J.P. Breslow E. Yang D. Chang W.R. Furey Jr., W.F. Sax M. Wang B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4240-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This is analogous to the amide proton of Phe3 in our bound structure, which is directed to the inside of the 20-membered ring moiety. Similar observations were noted with the bound structure of oxytocin to neurophysin-I (6Lippens G. Hallenga K. Van Belle D. Wodak S.J. Nirmala N.R. Hill P. Russell K.C. Smith D.D. Hruby V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9423-9434Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fact that the disulfide bond retains its flexibility in the bound structure of desmopressin suggests that it may not interact with neurophysin-II. This is interesting because earlier studies demonstrated that the disulfide bond of the peptide hormones binds to an apolar region of neurophysin (1Breslow E. Burman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 1-67Google Scholar). This suggests that there are differences in the binding between desmopressin and vasopressin/oxytocin to neurophysin. The flexibility of the disulfide bond in the free solution structure causes different orientations of the three-residue tail, as we discussed previously (11Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1995; 45: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar); however, the flexibility of the disulfide bond in the bound structure of desmopressin does not cause different orientations of the three-residue tail, as shown in Fig. 4. This difference also supports the concept that the three-residue tail of desmopressin is involved in binding to neurophysin, because the conformation of the three-residue tail is fixed by the interaction between the side chain of Arg8 and neurophysin-II. Taken together, the results in the present study indicate both similarities and differences in the binding of desmopressin to neurophysin-II when compared with that of the natural hormones vasopressin and oxytocin. Fig. 5 compares the bound structure of desmopressin with the crystal structure (wet-form) of deamino-oxytocin (Protein Data Bank code 1XY1). Note that Rose et al. (7Rose J.P. Wu C-K Hsiao C-D Breslow E. Wang B-C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) reported recently that the conformation of the critical residues Cys1 and Tyr2 of this structure is similar to those of Cys1 and Tyr2 observed in the oxytocin-neurophysin complex. To mimic the bound form of oxytocin, the crystal structure of deamino-oxytocin was modified to include a NH3+ group in the N-terminal. Fig. 5 shows oxytocin and desmopressin in a manner where a positive charge and the aromatic side chain of Tyr2 have similar orientations. The positive charge is from the N-terminal NH3+ in oxytocin and from the side chain of D-Arg8 in desmopressin. The type-II β-turn in the three-residue tail brings the side chain of Arg8 to be close to the side chain of Tyr2 in desmopressin. The side chain of Tyr2 orientates toward to the N-terminal NH3+ in oxytocin, which was confirmed by the crystal structure of oxytocin bound to neurophysin (7Rose J.P. Wu C-K Hsiao C-D Breslow E. Wang B-C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In an analogous way, the positive charge of D-Arg8 also orientates toward the Tyr2 side chain in desmopressin. The orientation of the Tyr2 side chain of the desmopressin bound structure is different from that of the structure of bound oxytocin in solution by Lippens et al. (6Lippens G. Hallenga K. Van Belle D. Wodak S.J. Nirmala N.R. Hill P. Russell K.C. Smith D.D. Hruby V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9423-9434Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the structure of bound oxytocin in solution, the Tyr2 side chain points away from Cys1 and orientates toward the Ile3 backbone; however, the Tyr2 side chain of desmopressin orientates toward the positive charge of Arg8. The orientation of the side chain of residue 3 between oxytocin (crystal structure/wet-form) and desmopressin is different. Although the side chain of Ile3 points away from the side chain of Tyr2 in oxytocin, the side chain of Phe3 orientates toward the side chain of Tyr2 in desmopressin. A similar result was also observed when the free crystal structure (wet-form) of deamino-oxytocin was compared with the crystal structure of the bound form of oxytocin (7Rose J.P. Wu C-K Hsiao C-D Breslow E. Wang B-C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Ile3 side chain in the bound form of oxytocin orientates toward the Tyr2 side chain, as clearly shown in Fig. 5 of Ref. 7Rose J.P. Wu C-K Hsiao C-D Breslow E. Wang B-C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar. The similarity between bound oxytocin and desmopressin suggests a possible common binding motif for all neurophyseal hormones, consisting of a positive charge, one apolar aromatic side chain, and a β-methylene group. The positive charge is from N-terminal NH3+ in vasopressin/oxytocin and from the positive side chain of D-Arg in desmopressin. The apolar aromatic side chain is from Tyr2, and the β-methylene is from Phe3. This common binding motif suggests that desmopressin may bind to neurophysin-II at its major hormone binding site. If desmopressin adopts an upside-down binding motif compared with that of oxytocin and vasopressin, the positive charge on D-Arg8 can be directed toward the Tyr2 side chain by the type-II β-turn in the C-terminal three-residue tail, thus forming the binding motif. Unlike oxytocin and vasopressin, the disulfide bond in desmopressin is away from this binding motif and is not involved in binding, therefore retaining its flexibility as shown in Fig. 4. This proposed new binding mode of desmopressin may give new insights into the mechanism of ligand-protein recognition in this system and suggests an unexpected adaptability of the protein binding site to accommodate novel ligands.
