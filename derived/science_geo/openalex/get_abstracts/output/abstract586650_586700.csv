https://openalex.org/W2613409207,"Here we present Singularity, software developed to bring containers and reproducibility to scientific computing. Using Singularity containers, developers can work in reproducible environments of their choosing and design, and these complete environments can easily be copied and executed on other platforms. Singularity is an open source initiative that harnesses the expertise of system and software engineers and researchers alike, and integrates seamlessly into common workflows for both of these groups. As its primary use case, Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and HPC centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute software and compute environments. This ability to create and deploy reproducible environments across these centers, a previously unmet need, makes Singularity a game changing development for computational science."

Cai et al. examined microvillar dynamics in living T cells in three dimensions and real time. The T cells palpated all spots on a surface within about 1 min through rapid movements of their microvilli. The time it took to scan the surface matched the movement rate of cells through tissues. These contacts took place in the absence of T cell receptor recognition and were stabilized independently of signaling or the cytoskeleton. Instead, stabilization depended on ligand affinity. The findings explain why many of the previously described components of the immunological synapse and T cell receptor signaling reside on three-dimensional microvillar-derived projections.

https://openalex.org/W2612887604,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex, systemic metabolic disease characterized by insulin resistance and resulting hyperglycemia, which is associated with impaired wound healing. The clinical complications associated with hyperglycemia are attributed, in part, to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent studies revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important regulatory roles in many biological processes. Specifically, lncRNA Lethe has been described as exhibiting an anti-inflammatory effect by binding to the p65 subunit of NFκB and blocking its binding to DNA and the subsequent activation of downstream genes. We therefore hypothesize that dysregulation of Lethe’s expression plays a role in hyperglycemia-induced ROS production. To test our hypothesis, we treated RAW264.7 macrophages with low glucose (5 mM) or high glucose (25 mM) for 24h. High glucose conditions significantly induced ROS production and NOX2 gene expression in RAW cells, while significantly decreasing Lethe gene expression. Overexpression of Lethe in RAW cells eliminated the increased ROS production induced by high glucose conditions, while also attenuating the upregulation of NOX2 expression. Similar results was found also in non-diabetic and diabetic primary macrophage, bone marrow derived macrophage (BMM). Furthermore, overexpression of Lethe in RAW cells treated with high glucose significantly reduced the translocation of p65-NFkB to the nucleus, which resulted in decreased NOX2 expression and ROS production. Interestingly, these findings are consistent with the decreased Lethe gene expression and increased NOX2 gene expression observed in a mouse model of diabetic wound healing. These findings provide the first evidence that lncRNA Lethe is involved in the regulation of ROS production in macrophages through modulation of NOX2 gene expression via NFκB signaling. Moreover, this is the first report to describe a role of lncRNAs, in particular Lethe, in impaired diabetic wound healing. Further studies are warranted to determine if correction of Lethe expression in diabetic wounds could improve healing."
https://openalex.org/W2612183428,"There is increasing evidence of the importance of multi-use landscapes for the conservation of large carnivores. However, when carnivore ranges overlap with high density of humans, there are often serious conservation challenges. This is especially true in countries like India where loss of peoples' lives and property to large wildlife are not uncommon. The leopard (Panthera pardus) is a large felid that is widespread in India, often sharing landscapes with high human densities. In order to understand the ecology of leopards in a human use landscape and the nature of human-leopard interactions, we studied (i) the spatial and temporal distribution and the characteristics of leopard attacks on people, (ii) the spatial variability in the pattern of habitat use by the leopard, and (iii) the spatial relationship between attack locations and habitat use by leopards. The study site, located in northern West Bengal, India, is a densely populated mixed-use landscape of 630 km2, comprising of forests, tea plantations, agriculture fields, and human settlements. A total of 171 leopard attacks on humans were reported between January 2009 and March 2016, most of which occurred within the tea-gardens. None of the attacks was fatal. We found significant spatial clustering of locations of leopard attacks on humans. However, most of the attacks were restricted to certain tea estates and occurred mostly between January and May. Analysis of habitat use by leopards showed that the probability of use of areas with more ground vegetation cover was high while that of areas with high density of buildings was low. However, locations of leopard attacks on people did not coincide with areas that showed a higher probability of use by leopards. This indicates that an increased use of an area by leopards, by itself, does not necessarily imply an increase in attacks on people. The spatial and temporal clustering of attack locations allowed us to use this information to prioritize areas to focus mitigation activities in order reduce negative encounters between people and leopards in this landscape which has had a long history of conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2612365971,"Accurate antigen detection is imperative for clinicians to diagnose disease, assess treatment success, and predict patient prognosis. The most common technique used for the detection of disease-associated biomarkers is the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In an ELISA, primary antibodies are incubated with biological samples containing the biomarker of interest. Then, detectible secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) bind the primary antibodies. Upon addition of a color-changing substrate, the samples provide a colorimetric signal that directly correlates to the targeted biomarker concentration. While ELISAs are effective for analyzing samples with high biomarker content, they lack the sensitivity required to analyze samples with low antigen levels. We hypothesized that the sensitivity of ELISAs could be enhanced by replacing freely delivered primary antibodies with antibody-nanoparticle conjugates that provide excess binding sites for detectible secondary antibodies, ultimately leading to increased signal. Here, we investigated the use of nanoshells (NS) decorated with antibodies specific to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a model system (EGFR-NS). We incubated one healthy and two breast cancer cell lines, each expressing different levels of EGFR, with EGFR-NS, untargeted NS, or unconjugated EGFR antibodies, as well as detectable secondary antibodies. We found that EGFR-NS consistently increased signal intensity relative to unconjugated EGFR antibodies, with a substantial 13-fold enhancement from cells expressing high levels of EGFR. Additionally, 40x more unconjugated antibodies were required to detect EGFR compared to those conjugated to NS. Our results demonstrate that antibody-nanoparticle conjugates lower the detection limit of traditional ELISAs and support further investigation of this strategy with other antibodies and nanoparticles. Owing to their enhanced sensitivity, we anticipate that nanoparticle-modified ELISAs can be used to detect low levels of biomarkers found in various diseases, such as cancers, tuberculosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and may ultimately enable earlier diagnosis, better prognostication, and improved treatment monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2612496804,"Highly coordinated regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation contributes to the formation of functionally shaped and sized teeth; however, the mechanism underlying the switch from cell cycle exit to cell differentiation during odontogenesis is poorly understood. Recently, we identified pannexin 3 (Panx3) as a member of the pannexin gap junction protein family from tooth germs. The expression of Panx3 was predominately localized in preodontoblasts that arise from dental papilla cells and can differentiate into dentin-secreting odontoblasts. Panx3 also co-localized with p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein, in preodontoblasts. Panx3 was expressed in primary dental mesenchymal cells and in the mDP dental mesenchymal cell line. Both Panx3 and p21 were induced during the differentiation of mDP cells. Overexpression of Panx3 in mDP cells reduced cell proliferation via up-regulation of p21, but not of p27, and promoted the Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and the expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp), a marker of differentiated odontoblasts. Furthermore, Panx3 released intracellular ATP into the extracellular space through its hemichannel and induced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-ribonucleoside (AICAR), an activator of AMPK, reduced mDP cell proliferation and induced p21 expression. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous Panx3 by siRNA inhibited AMPK phosphorylation, p21 expression, and the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 even in the presence of BMP2. Taken together, our results suggest that Panx3 modulates intracellular ATP levels, resulting in the inhibition of odontoblast proliferation through the AMPK/p21 signaling pathway and promotion of cell differentiation by the BMP/Smad signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2613946146,"Background The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is growing. However the factors contributing to changes over time and to birth cohort differences in CAM use are not well understood. Setting We used data from 10186 participants, who were aged 20–69 years at the first cycle of data collection in the longitudinal component of the Canadian National Population Health Survey (1994/95-2010/11). We examined chiropractic and other practitioner-based CAM use with a focus on five birth cohorts: pre-World War II (born 1925–1934); World War II (born 1935–1944); older baby boomers (born 1945–1954); younger baby boomers (born 1955–1964); and Gen Xers (born 1965–1974). The survey collected data every two years on predisposing (e.g., sex, education), enabling (e.g., income), behavior-related factors (e.g., obesity), need (e.g., chronic conditions), and use of conventional care (primary care and specialists). Results The findings suggest that, at corresponding ages, more recent cohorts reported greater CAM (OR = 25.9, 95% CI: 20.0; 33.6 for Gen Xers vs. pre-World War) and chiropractic use than their predecessors (OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.7; 2.8 for Gen Xers vs. pre-World War). There was also a secular trend of increasing CAM use, but not chiropractic use, over time (period effect) across all ages. Factors associated with cohort differences were different for CAM and chiropractic use. Cohort differences in CAM use were partially related to a period effect of increasing CAM use over time across all ages while cohort differences in chiropractic use were related to the higher prevalence of chronic conditions among recent cohorts. The use of conventional care was positively related to greater CAM use (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.6; 2.0) and chiropractic use (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1; 1.4) but did not contribute to changes over time or to cohort differences in CAM and chiropractic use. Conclusion The higher CAM use over time and in recent cohorts could reflect how recent generations are approaching their healthcare needs by expanding conventional care to include CAM therapies and practice for treatment and health promotion. The findings also underscore the importance of doctors discussing CAM use with their patients."
https://openalex.org/W2613552203,"The argonaute protein from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus shows DNA-guided DNA interfering activity at high temperatures, complicating its application in mammalian cells. A recent work reported that the argonaute protein from Natronobacterium gregoryi (NgAgo) had DNA-guided genome editing activity in mammalian cells. We compared the genome editing activities of NgAgo and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) in human HEK293T cells side by side. EGFP reporter assays and DNA sequencing consistently revealed high genome editing activity from SaCas9. However, these assays did not demonstrate genome editing activity by NgAgo. We confirmed that the conditions allowed simultaneous transfection of the NgAgo expressing plasmid DNA and DNA guides, as well as heterologous expression of NgAgo in the HEK293T cells. Our data show that NgAgo is not a robust genome editing tool, although it may have such activity under other conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2612183921,"As a core subunit of the SCF complex that promotes protein degradation through the 26S proteasome, S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1) plays important roles in multiple cellular processes in eukaryotes, including gibberellin (GA), jasmonate, ethylene, auxin and light responses. P7-2 encoded by Rice black streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), a devastating viral pathogen that causes severe symptoms in infected plants, interacts with SKP1 from different plants. However, whether RBSDV P7-2 forms a SCF complex and targets host proteins is poorly understood. In this study, we conducted yeast two-hybrid assays to further explore the interactions between P7-2 and 25 type I Oryza sativa SKP1-like (OSK) proteins, and found that P7-2 interacted with eight OSK members with different binding affinity. Co-immunoprecipitation assay further confirmed the interaction of P7-2 with OSK1, OSK5 and OSK20. It was also shown that P7-2, together with OSK1 and O. sativa Cullin-1, was able to form the SCF complex. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that P7-2 interacted with gibberellin insensitive dwarf2 (GID2) from rice and maize plants, which is essential for regulating the GA signaling pathway. It was further demonstrated that the N-terminal region of P7-2 was necessary for the interaction with GID2. Overall, these results indicated that P7-2 functioned as a component of the SCF complex in rice, and interaction of P7-2 with GID2 implied possible roles of the GA signaling pathway during RBSDV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2612702791,"A three-dimensional (3D)-printed customized bolus (3D bolus) can be used for radiotherapy application to irregular surfaces. However, bolus fabrication based on computed tomography (CT) scans is complicated and also delivers unwanted irradiation. Consequently, we fabricated a bolus using a 3D scanner and evaluated its efficacy. The head of an Alderson Rando phantom was scanned with a 3D scanner. The 3D surface data were exported and reconstructed with Geomagic Design X software. A 3D bolus of 5-mm thickness designed to fit onto the nose was printed with the use of rubber-like printing material, and a radiotherapy plan was developed. We successfully fabricated the customized 3D bolus, and further, a CT simulation indicated an acceptable fit of the 3D bolus to the nose. There was no air gap between the bolus and the phantom surface. The percent depth dose (PDD) curve of the phantom with the 3D bolus showed an enhanced surface dose when compared with that of the phantom without the bolus. The PDD of the 3D bolus was comparable with that of a commercial superflab bolus. The radiotherapy plan considering the 3D bolus showed improved target coverage when compared with that without the bolus. Thus, we successfully fabricated a customized 3D bolus for an irregular surface using a 3D scanner instead of a CT scanner."
https://openalex.org/W2612766777,"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a severe and life-threatening complication among patients with portal hypertension (PH). Covered transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is the treatment of choice for patients with refractory or recurrent UGIB despite pharmacological and endoscopic therapy. In some patients, TIPS implantation is not possible due to co-morbidity or vascular disorders. Spleen embolization (SE) may be a promising alternative in this setting.We retrospectively analyzed 9 patients with PH-induced UGIB who underwent partial SE between 2012 and 2016. All patients met the following criteria: (i) upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage with primary or secondary failure of endoscopic interventions and (ii) TIPS implantation not possible. Each patient was followed for at least 6 months after embolization.Five patients (56%) suffered from cirrhotic PH, 4 patients (44%) from non-cirrhotic PH. UGIB occured in terms of refractory hemorrhage from gastric varices (3/9; 33%), hemorrhage from esophageal varices (3/9; 33%), and finally, hemorrhage from portal-hypertensive gastropathy (3/9; 33%). None of the patients treated with partial SE experienced re-bleeding episodes or required blood transfusions during a total follow-up time of 159 months, including both patients with cirrhotic- and non-cirrhotic PH.Partial SE, as a minimally invasive intervention with low procedure-associated complications, may be a valuable alternative for patients with recurrent PH-induced UGIB refractory to standard therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2612057859,"Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in cardioprotection, and recent work from our group and others has implicated protein S-nitrosylation (SNO) as a critical component of NO-mediated protection in different models, including ischemic pre- and post-conditioning and sex-dependent cardioprotection. However, studies have yet to examine whether protein SNO levels are similarly increased with pharmacologic preconditioning in male and female hearts, and whether an increase in protein SNO levels, which is protective in male hearts, is sufficient to increase baseline protection in female hearts. Therefore, we pharmacologically preconditioned male and female hearts with the adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyl adenosine (CHA). CHA administration prior to ischemia significantly improved functional recovery in both male and female hearts compared to baseline in a Langendorff-perfused heart model of ischemia-reperfusion injury (% of preischemic function ± SE: male baseline: 37.5±3.4% vs. male CHA: 55.3±3.2%; female baseline: 61.4±5.7% vs. female CHA: 76.0±6.2%). In a separate set of hearts, we found that CHA increased p-Akt and p-eNOS levels. We also used SNO-resin-assisted capture with LC-MS/MS to identify SNO proteins in male and female hearts, and determined that CHA perfusion induced a modest increase in protein SNO levels in both male (11.4%) and female (12.3%) hearts compared to baseline. These findings support a potential role for protein SNO in a model of pharmacologic preconditioning, and provide evidence to suggest that a modest increase in protein SNO levels is sufficient to protect both male and female hearts from ischemic injury. In addition, a number of the SNO proteins identified with CHA treatment were also observed with other forms of cardioprotective stimuli in prior studies, further supporting a role for protein SNO in cardioprotection."

We use data from the City of Aarhus in Denmark, combining test score data with a comprehensive data set obtained from administrative registers. We use two different methodological approaches to identify and estimate treatment effects and we tend to find positive effects, indicating that knowledge acquired through chess play can be transferred to the domain of mathematics. We also find larger impacts for unhappy children and children who are bored in school, perhaps because chess instruction facilitates learning by providing an alternative approach to mathematics for these children. The results are encouraging and suggest that chess may be an important and effective tool for improving mathematical capacity in young students."
https://openalex.org/W2614018296,"Previous studies show that forest net primary productivity (NPP) varies pronouncedly with stand age, and these variations play a crucial role in determining forest carbon sinks or sources at regional scales. Some forest carbon cycling models, eg. InTEC (The integrated terrestrial ecosystem C-budget model), calculates annual forest NPP in the long term according to normalized NPP-age relationships and the reference forest NPP at a given age. Therefore, the accurate NPP-age relationship is important for forest NPP estimation. In this study, NPP at various stand ages for twelve major forest stand types in Heilongjiang Province in northeast China is derived from yield tables with consideration of the total biomass increment and foliage and fine-root turnovers. Similar to previous studies, our results also show that forest NPP increases quickly at young ages, reaches the maximum value at middle age (10-40 years old), and then decreases to a relative stable level at old ages. However, we additionally found that forests under better site conditions have faster growth rates in young ages and steeper declines after reaching the maximum. Therefore, when the NPP-age curves for different site indices are normalized against the maximum value of each curve, there are significant differences among them. These differences have implications on the methodology for estimating the spatial distribution of forest carbon sources and sinks."
https://openalex.org/W2612223798,"Background Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Dietary intervention on adverse cardiac remodeling after MI has significant clinical relevance. Rosemary leaves are a natural product with antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties, but its effect on morphology and ventricular function after MI is unknown. Methods and results To determine the effect of the dietary supplementation of rosemary leaves on cardiac remodeling after MI, male Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups after sham procedure or experimental induced MI: 1) Sham group fed standard chow (SR0, n = 23); 2) Sham group fed standard chow supplemented with 0.02% rosemary (R002) (SR002, n = 23); 3) Sham group fed standard chow supplemented with 0.2% rosemary (R02) (SR02, n = 22); 4) group submitted to MI and fed standard chow (IR0, n = 13); 5) group submitted to MI and fed standard chow supplemented with R002 (IR002, n = 8); and 6) group submitted to MI and fed standard chow supplemented with R02 (IR02, n = 9). After 3 months of the treatment, systolic pressure evaluation, echocardiography and euthanasia were performed. Left ventricular samples were evaluated for: fibrosis, cytokine levels, apoptosis, energy metabolism enzymes, and oxidative stress. Rosemary dietary supplementation attenuated cardiac remodeling by improving energy metabolism and decreasing oxidative stress. Rosemary supplementation of 0.02% improved diastolic function and reduced hypertrophy after MI. Regarding rosemary dose, 0.02% and 0.2% for rats are equivalent to 11 mg and 110 mg for humans, respectively. Conclusion Our findings support further investigations of the rosemary use as adjuvant therapy in adverse cardiac remodeling."

Combined with the prevalence of online survey platforms, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which facilitate surveys with hundreds or thousands of participants, BTS must be effective in large-scale experiments for BTS to become a readily accepted tool in real-world applications. We demonstrate that BTS quantifiably improves honesty in large-scale online surveys where the ""honest"" distribution of answers is known in expectation on aggregate. Furthermore, we explore a marketing application where ""honest"" answers cannot be known, but find that BTS treatment impacts the resulting distributions of answers."
https://openalex.org/W2952897965,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, single stranded RNA molecules that regulate the stability and translation of messenger RNAs in diverse eukaryotic groups. Several miRNA genes are of ancient origin and have been maintained in the genomes of animal and plant taxa for hundreds of millions of years, playing key roles in development and physiology. In the last decade, genome and small RNA (sRNA) sequencing of several plant species have helped unveil the evolutionary history of land plants. Among these, the fern group (monilophytes) occupies a key phylogenetic position, as it represents the closest extant cousin taxon of seed plants, i.e. gymno- and angiosperms. However, in spite of their evolutionary, economic and ecological importance, no fern genome has been sequenced yet and few genomic resources are available for this group. Here, we sequenced the small RNA fraction of an epiphytic South American fern, Pleopeltis minima (Polypodiaceae), and compared it to plant miRNA databases, allowing for the identification of miRNA families that are shared by all land plants, shared by all vascular plants (tracheophytes) or shared by euphyllophytes (ferns and seed plants) only. Using the recently described transcriptome of another fern, Lygodium japonicum, we also estimated the degree of conservation of fern miRNA targets in relation to other plant groups. Our results pinpoint the origin of several miRNA families in the land plant evolutionary tree with more precision and are a resource for future genomic and functional studies of fern miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2612505929,"This study investigated the pathogenesis of two variant strains (LLG and POS) of Chlamydia abortus, in comparison to a typical wild-type strain (S26/3) which is known to be responsible for late term abortion in small ruminants. Challenge with the three strains at mid-gestation resulted in similar pregnancy outcomes, with abortion occurring in approximately 50-60% of ewes with the mean gestational lengths also being similar. However, differences were observed in the severity of placental pathology, with infection appearing milder for strain LLG, which was reflected in the lower number of organisms shed in vaginal swabs post-partum and less gross pathology and organisms present in placental smears. Results for strain POS were somewhat different than LLG with a more focal restriction of infection observed. Post-abortion antibody responses revealed prominent differences in seropositivity to the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) present in elementary body (EB) preparations under denaturing conditions, most notably with anti-LLG and anti-POS convalescent sera where there was no or reduced detection of MOMP present in EBs derived from the three strains. These results and additional analysis of whole EB and chlamydial outer membrane complex preparations suggest that there are conformational differences in MOMP for the three strains. Overall, the results suggest that gross placental pathology and clinical outcome is not indicative of bacterial colonization and the severity of infection. The results also highlight potential conformational differences in MOMP epitopes that perhaps impact on disease diagnosis and the development of new vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W2612906983,"Climatic, sociological and environmental conditions are known to affect the spatial distribution of malaria vectors and disease transmission. Intensive use of insecticides in the agricultural and public health sectors exerts a strong selective pressure on resistance genes in malaria vectors. Spatio-temporal models of favorable conditions for Anopheles species' presence were developed to estimate the probability of presence of malaria vectors and insecticide resistance in Lao PDR. These models were based on environmental and meteorological conditions, and demographic factors. GIS software was used to build and manage a spatial database with data collected from various geographic information providers. GIS was also used to build and run the models. Results showed that potential insecticide use and therefore the probability of resistance to insecticide is greater in the southwestern part of the country, specifically in Champasack province and where malaria incidence is already known to be high. These findings can help national authorities to implement targeted and effective vector control strategies for malaria prevention and elimination among populations most at risk. Results can also be used to focus the insecticide resistance surveillance in Anopheles mosquito populations in more restricted area, reducing the area of surveys, and making the implementation of surveillance system for Anopheles mosquito insecticide resistance possible."
https://openalex.org/W2613929436,"Regulation of gene expression levels is essential for all living systems and transcription factors (TFs) are the main regulators of gene expression through their ability to repress or induce transcription. A balance between synthesis and degradation rates controls gene expression levels. To determine which rate is dominant, we analyzed the correlation between expression levels of a TF and its regulated gene based on a mathematical model. We selected about 280,000 expression patterns of 355 TFs and 647 regulated genes using DNA microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository. Based on our model, correlation between the expressions of TF–regulated gene pairs corresponds to tuning of the synthesis rate, whereas no correlation indicates excessive synthesis and requires tuning of the degradation rate. The gene expression relationships between TF–regulated gene pairs were classified into four types that correspond to different gene regulatory mechanisms. It was surprising that fewer than 20% of these genes were governed by the familiar regulatory mechanism, i.e., through the synthesis rate. Moreover, we performed pathway analysis and found that each classification type corresponded to distinct gene functions: cellular regulation pathways were dominant in the type with synthesis rate regulation and terms associated with diseases such as cancer, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease were dominant in the type with degradation rate regulation. Interestingly, these diseases are caused by the accumulation of proteins. These results indicated that gene expression is regulated structurally, not arbitrarily, according to the gene function. This funding is indicative of a systematic control of transcription processes at the whole-cell level."
https://openalex.org/W2612463627,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid mediator that is thought to be involved in various diseases. Although the main source of S1P in the plasma is erythrocytes, how S1P is exported from erythrocytes has not been elucidated. When we differentiated K562 cells into erythroblast-like cells with sodium butyrate, we observed that the efflux of S1P was increased without increased expression of previously proposed S1P transporters, while the expression levels of Band3 were increased. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the involvement of Band 3, the most characteristic membranous transporter for erythrocytes, in S1P efflux, using 4,4'-diisothiocyanatodihydrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, disodium salt (H2DIDS), which is an inhibitor of Band3. First, we treated human washed erythrocytes with H2DIDS and found that H2DIDS decreased the S1P levels in the supernatant, while it increased the cellular S1P contents. Next, when we injected H2DIDS into mice, the plasma S1P level was significantly decreased. Finally, when we overexpressed or suppressed Band3 in K562 cells, S1P efflux was enhanced or decreased, respectively, while the overexpression of Band3 in HEK293 cells did not modulate S1P efflux. These results suggested the possible involvement of Band3 in the transport of S1P, a multi-functional bioactive phospholipid, from erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2613859222,"Objectives Both aging and hypertension are significant risk factors for heart failure in the elderly. The purpose of this study was to determine how aging, with and without hypertension, affects left ventricular function. Methods Cross-sectional study of magnetic resonance imaging and 31P spectroscopy-based measurements of left ventricular structure, global function, strains, pulse wave velocity, high energy phosphate metabolism in 48 normal subjects and 40 treated hypertensive patients (though no other cardiovascular disease or diabetes) stratified into 3 age deciles from 50–79 years. Results Normal aging was associated with significant increases in systolic blood pressure, vascular stiffness, torsion, and impaired diastolic function (all P<0.05). Age-matched hypertension exacerbated the effects of aging on systolic pressure, and diastolic function. Hypertension alone, and not aging, was associated with increased left ventricular mass index, reduced energetic reserve, reduced longitudinal shortening and increased endocardial circumferential shortening (all P<0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that these unique hypertensive features were significantly related to systolic blood pressure (P<0.05). Conclusions 1) Hypertension adds to the age-related changes in systolic blood pressure and diastolic function; 2) hypertension is uniquely associated with changes in several aspects of left ventricular structure, function, systolic strains, and energetics; and 3) these uniquely hypertensive-associated parameters are related to the level of systolic blood pressure and so are potentially modifiable."
https://openalex.org/W2613876175,"Human land use is continuously altering the natural environment, yet the greater ecological implications of this change for many groups that are key to healthy ecosystem functioning remains uncharacterised in the tropics. Terrestrial scavenging vertebrates are one such group, providing integral ecosystem services through the removal of carrion which is a crucial component of both nutrient cycling and disease dynamics. To explore how anthropogenic processes may affect forest scavengers, we investigated the changes in the relative occupancy of two important terrestrial scavengers along a gradient of land use intensity, ranging from protected forest to oil palm plantation in Borneo. We found the Malay civet (Viverra tangalunga) had highest, albeit variable, occupancy in areas of low land use intensity and the Southeast Asian water monitor (Varanus salvator macromaculatus) had highest occupancy in areas of high land use intensity. Land use had no effect on the combined occupancy of the two species. In high land use intensity sites, individual water monitors were larger and had better body condition, but at population level had a highly biased sex ratio with more males than females and increased signs of intraspecific conflict. We did not assess scavenging rate or efficiency as a process, but the high occupancy rates and apparent health of the scavengers in high land use intensity landscapes suggests this ecological process is robust to land use change."
https://openalex.org/W2612982852,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion within exon1 of the HTT gene. The gene generates two mRNA variants that carry either a short or long 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) while encoding the same protein. It remains unknown whether the two mRNA variants play distinct roles in HD pathogenesis. We found that the long HTT 3'UTR was capable of guiding mRNA to neuronal dendrites, suggesting that some long-form HTT mRNA is transported to dendrites for local protein synthesis. To assay roles of two HTT mRNA variants in cell bodies, we expressed mRNA harboring HTT exon1 containing 23x or 145x CAGs with the short or long 3'UTR. We found that mutant mRNA containing the short 3'UTR produced more protein aggregates and caused more apoptosis in both cultured neurons and HEK293 cells, compared with mutant mRNA containing the long 3'UTR. Although the two 3'UTRs did not affect mRNA stability, we detected higher levels of protein synthesis from mRNA containing the short 3'UTR than from mRNA containing the long 3'UTR. These results indicate that the long HTT 3'UTR suppresses translation. Thus, short-form mutant HTT mRNA will be more efficient in producing toxic protein than its long-form counterpart."

During senescence, cells remain in a state of growth arrest. Accumulation of similar nonfunctional cells has been linked to chronic inflammatory diseases and degenerative disorders. Inflammation after joint injury is a common sequela. Jeon et al. sought to understand whether senescence was involved in the development of osteoarthritis by using a model of anterior cruciate ligament surgery. Senescent cells assembled in the traumatized knee joint and triggered development of osteoarthritis and cartilage erosion in mice. By injecting a drug that caused the specific removal of these cells, the arthritis symptoms were alleviated, and cartilage regeneration and recovery were improved.

https://openalex.org/W2612031720,"In this paper we propose a new methodology for the analysis of metabolic networks. We use the notion of strongly connected components of a graph, called in this context metabolic building blocks. Every strongly connected component is contracted to a single node in such a way that the resulting graph is a directed acyclic graph, called a metabolic DAG, with a considerably reduced number of nodes. The property of being a directed acyclic graph brings out a background graph topology that reveals the connectivity of the metabolic network, as well as bridges, isolated nodes and cut nodes. Altogether, it becomes a key information for the discovery of functional metabolic relations. Our methodology has been applied to the glycolysis and the purine metabolic pathways for all organisms in the KEGG database, although it is general enough to work on any database. As expected, using the metabolic DAGs formalism, a considerable reduction on the size of the metabolic networks has been obtained, specially in the case of the purine pathway due to its relative larger size. As a proof of concept, from the information captured by a metabolic DAG and its corresponding metabolic building blocks, we obtain the core of the glycolysis pathway and the core of the purine metabolism pathway and detect some essential metabolic building blocks that reveal the key reactions in both pathways. Finally, the application of our methodology to the glycolysis pathway and the purine metabolism pathway reproduce the tree of life for the whole set of the organisms represented in the KEGG database which supports the utility of this research."
https://openalex.org/W2612525158,"To investigate sexual dimorphism and postnatal changes in skin collagen expression, mRNA levels of collagens and their regulatory factors in male and female skin were examined during the first 120 days of age by quantitative realtime PCR. Levels of mRNAs encoding extracellular matrices did not show any differences between male and female mice until day 15. Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs noticeably increased at day 30 and remained at high levels until day 120 in male mice, while those in female mice remained at low levels during the period. Consistent with the mRNA expression, pepsin-soluble type I collagen contents in skin was very high in mature male as compared to female. Col3a1 mRNA in male mice also showed significantly high level at day 120 as compared to female. On the other hand, expression of mRNAs encoding TGF-ßs and their receptors did not show apparent sexual dimorphism although small significant differences were observed at some points. Castration at 60 days of age resulted in a significant decrease in type I collagen mRNA expression within 3 days, and noticeably decreased expression of all fibril collagen mRNAs examined within 14 days, while administration of testosterone tube maintained the mRNA expression at high levels. Despite the in vivo effect of testosterone, administration of physiological concentrations of testosterone did not affect fibril collagen mRNA expression in either human or mouse skin fibroblasts in vitro, suggesting that testosterone does not directly affect collagen expression in fibroblasts. In summary, present study demonstrated dynamic postnatal changes in expression of collagens and their regulatory factors, and suggest that testosterone and its effects on collagen expression are responsible for the skin sexual dimorphism but the effects of testosterone is not due to direct action on dermal fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2613565829,"One of the key pathophysiologies of H5N1 infection is excessive proinflammatory cytokine response (cytokine storm) characterized by increases in IFN-β, TNF-α, IL-6, CXCL10, CCL4, CCL2 and CCL5 in the respiratory tract. H5N1-induced cytokine release can occur via an infection-independent mechanism, however, detail of the cellular signaling involved is poorly understood. To elucidate this mechanism, the effect of inactivated (β-propiolactone-treated) H5N1 on the cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression in 16HBE14o- human respiratory epithelial cells was investigated. We found that the inactivated-H5N1 increased mRNA for IL-6 and CXCL8 but not TNF-α, CCL5 or CXCL10. This effect of the inactivated-H5N1 was inhibited by sialic acid receptor inhibitor (α-2,3 sialidase), adenosine diphosphatase (apyrase), P2Y receptor (P2YR) inhibitor (suramin), P2Y6R antagonist (MRS2578), phospholipase C inhibitor (U73122), protein kinase C inhibitors (BIM and Gö6976) and cell-permeant Ca2+ chelator (BAPTA-AM). Inhibitors of MAPK signaling, including of ERK1/2 (PD98059), p38 MAPK (SB203580) and JNK (SP600125) significantly suppressed the inactivated-H5N1-induced mRNA expression of CXCL8. On the other hand, the inactivated-H5N1-induced mRNA expression of IL-6 was inhibited by SB203580, but not PD98059 or SP600125, whereas SN-50, an inhibitor of NF-κB, inhibited the effect of virus on mRNA expression of both of IL-6 and CXCL8. Taken together, our data suggest that, without infection, inactivated-H5N1 induces mRNA expression of IL-6 and CXCL8 by a mechanism, or mechanisms, requiring interaction between viral hemagglutinin and α-2,3 sialic acid receptors at the cell membrane of host cells, and involves activation of P2Y6 purinergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2614067939,"Calcium signal plays an important role in a variety of cancer cell metabolism, but knowledge on its role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is limited. Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is the principal Ca2+ entry mechanism that maintains calcium concentration and produces calcium signal in non-excitable cells. SOCE is triggered by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which is located in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as Ca2+ sensor. Although, many studies demonstrated that STIM1 and SOCE play important functions in the regulation of many cancer progressions, their clinical relevance in HNSCC remains unclear. In this study, STIM1 expression levels notably increased in 89% HNSCC tissues compared with those in adjacent normal tissues. Meanwhile, this overexpression was close associated with tumor size but not with neck lymph node metastasis. Thus, this study mainly focuses on STIM1 function in HNSCC tumor growth. Three HNSCC cell lines, namely, TSCCA (oral cancer cell line) and Hep2 (laryngeal cell line) with high STIM1 expression levels and Tb3.1 (oral cancer cell line) with STIM1 expression level lower than previous two cell lines, were selected for in vitro study. Downregulated STIM1 expression levels in TSCCA and Hep2 arrested cells in G0/G1 stages, promoted cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation. By contrast, upregulated STIM1 expression in Tb3.1 inhibited cell apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation. Induced by thapsigargin (TG), ER stress was amplified when STIM1 expression was downregulated but was attenuated as STIM1 expression was upregulated. Furthermore, TSCCA cell xenograft models confirmed that STIM1 could promote HNSCC tumor growth in vivo. The present study provides new insight into HNSCC molecular mechanism and potential therapeutic target through targeting SOCE-dependent process. However, whether STIM1 participates in HNSCC metastasis requires further study."

Just a few years ago, many researchers were skeptical or even outright critical of novel sequencing devices that read the bases in a DNA strand as it threads through a nanometer-sized pore. But last week, at a meeting in London organized by the devices9 maker, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, academic researchers described using the instruments to decipher large genomes, rapidly characterize microbes, diagnose antibiotic resistance, and directly assess gene activity in cells. These portable sequencers have even proved their mettle in remote locations such as the Antarctic and underground, and Oxford Nanopore teased attendees with demos of a device powered by a smartphone. Some researchers caution that nanopore sequencers remain error-prone, and that the technology is still changing too quickly to be widely used. But others have fully embraced them, saying they greatly expand the potential for sequencers to be used by everyone."
https://openalex.org/W2613330117,"Renal injuries are relatively common in cases of abdominal trauma. Adhesives and sealants can be used to repair and preserve damaged organs. Using a rat model, this study explores the activity of different matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) during the healing of renal injuries treated by two biological adhesives (TachoSil and GelitaSpon) and a new synthetic elastic cyanoacrylate (Adhflex).Renal traumatic injuries were experimentally induced in 90 male Wistar rats by a Stiefel Biopsy Punch in the anterior aspect of the left kidney. Animals were divided into five groups: 1, sham non-injured (n = 3); 2, non-treated standard punch injury (n = 6); 3, punch injury treated with TachoSil (n = 27); 4, punch injury treated with GelitaSpon (n = 27); and, 5, punch injury treated with Adhflex (n = 27). Wound healing was evaluated 2, 6, and 18 days after injury by determining the expression of MMPs, and the histopathological evolution of lesions.Histologically, the wound size at 6 days post-injury was larger in Adhflex-treated samples than in the other treatments, but the scarring tissue was similar at 18 days post-injury. Only the MMPs subtypes 1, 2, 8, 9, and 13 were sufficiently expressed to be quantifiable. Both time since injury and treatment type had a significant influence on MMPs expression. Two days after injury, the expression of MMP8 and MMP9 was predominant. MMP2 expression was greater 6 days after injury. The Adhflex-treated group had a significantly higher MMPs expression than the other treatment groups at all healing stages.All three sealant treatments induced almost similar expression of MMPs than untreated animals indicating a physiological healing process. Given that all renal trauma injuries must be considered emergencies, both biological and synthetic adhesives, such as Adhflex, should be considered as a treatment options."
https://openalex.org/W2613606755,"Objective Oxygen enhanced pulmonary MRI is a promising modality for functional lung studies and has been applied to a wide range of pulmonary conditions. The purpose of this study was to characterize the oxygen enhancement effect in the lungs of healthy, never-smokers, in light of a previously established relationship between oxygen enhancement and diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide in the lung (DL,CO) in patients with lung disease. Methods In 30 healthy never-smoking volunteers, an inversion recovery with gradient echo read-out (Snapshot-FLASH) was used to quantify the difference in longitudinal relaxation rate, while breathing air and 100% oxygen, ΔR1, at 1.5 Tesla. Measurements were performed under multiple tidal inspiration breath-holds. Results In single parameter linear models, ΔR1 exhibit a significant correlation with age (p = 0.003) and BMI (p = 0.0004), but not DL,CO (p = 0.33). Stepwise linear regression of ΔR1 yields an optimized model including an age-BMI interaction term. Conclusion In this healthy, never-smoking cohort, age and BMI are both predictors of the change in MRI longitudinal relaxation rate when breathing oxygen. However, DL,CO does not show a significant correlation with the oxygen enhancement. This is possibly because oxygen transfer in the lung is not diffusion limited at rest in healthy individuals. This work stresses the importance of using a physiological model to understand results from oxygen enhanced MRI."

The Phylogenetics and Networks for Generalised HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA HIV) consortium for the past 4 years has been sequencing HIVs plucked from blood samples that were collected from 20 different clinical trials. The relationship between these sequences allows researchers to create family trees, or phylogenies, that can reveal transmission clusters and potentially offer novel ways for public health workers to intervene and try to slow HIV9s spread. But the meeting, which will be held in London, will also discuss the way these same data can cause harm. Phylogenetic HIV information has been used to prosecute people for transmitting HIV in several countries. What9s more, the clusters can also reveal behavior that9s often criminalized or stigmatized such as men having sex with men or people injecting drugs. PANGEA HIV anonymizes the data and takes several precautions to make sure that individuals cannot be identified. But these protections have been breached in the past, and the meeting will discuss how best to make sure that people who provide their HIV samples are not punished for participating in efforts that ultimately aim to help people control their infections and slow spread in communities."

Chemists are late to the game that plants play of using visible light to make carbon-carbon bonds. Nonetheless, they have made up for lost time over the past decade, applying light activation of precious iridium and ruthenium catalysts to a wide variety of molecular transformations. Zhang et al. and Caputo et al. now report that nanoparticulate quantum dots (cadmium sulfide and cadmium selenide, respectively) can also catalyze several of these photoredox reactions. Composed of more abundant elements, these quantum dots further benefit from high light-absorption cross sections and straightforward tunability through variation of diameter and surface ligand structure.

Critics argue the ministry9s move will waste scarce resources on duplicative efforts, because Brazil9s National Institute of Space Research (INPE) already performs much of the requested work. Analysts note that the contract could eat up as much as 18% of the ministry9s current annual budget, which was cut 51% in March to $142 million. The ministry says INPE will continue to monitor the Amazon, but that it needs outside help to strengthen DETER and other antideforestation efforts. In particular, the ministry said in a statement that it is looking to tap technology, such as synthetic aperture radar, not available from INPE. Experts worry that multiple data sources could create confusion over deforestation trends.

The parasitic weed Striga infests a large proportion of cereal crops in Africa and parts of Asia, which has a devastating effect on farming, particularly in subsistence communities. An obligate parasite, Striga requires a chemical signal from the host plant to germinate, offering an avenue for genetic improvement of host crops. Gobena et al. studied the difference between sorghum strains associated with high and low Striga germination levels and mapped a mutation associated with low Striga germination ( LGS1 ) to a previously uncharacterized sulfotransferase gene. Deletion of this gene does not result in reduced levels of root chemical signaling, but rather in a change in the composition of chemicals exuded from the root. Identification of this gene could allow marker-assisted breeding to generate sorghum varieties with reduced Striga infestation.
