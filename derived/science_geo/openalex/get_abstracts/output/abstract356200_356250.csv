https://openalex.org/W1980020302,"Nephrons, the basic functional units of the kidney, are generated repetitively during kidney organogenesis from a mesenchymal progenitor population. Which cells within this pool give rise to nephrons and how multiple nephron lineages form during this protracted developmental process are unclear. We demonstrate that the Six2-expressing cap mesenchyme represents a multipotent nephron progenitor population. Six2-expressing cells give rise to all cell types of the main body of the nephron during all stages of nephrogenesis. Pulse labeling of Six2-expressing nephron progenitors at the onset of kidney development suggests that the Six2-expressing population is maintained by self-renewal. Clonal analysis indicates that at least some Six2-expressing cells are multipotent, contributing to multiple domains of the nephron. Furthermore, Six2 functions cell autonomously to maintain a progenitor cell status, as cap mesenchyme cells lacking Six2 activity contribute to ectopic nephron tubules, a mechanism dependent on a Wnt9b inductive signal. Taken together, our observations suggest that Six2 activity cell-autonomously regulates a multipotent nephron progenitor population."
https://openalex.org/W2067163479,"Self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is promoted by FGF and TGFbeta/Activin signaling, and differentiation is promoted by BMP signaling, but how these signals regulate genes critical to the maintenance of pluripotency has been unclear. Using a defined medium, we show here that both TGFbeta and FGF signals synergize to inhibit BMP signaling; sustain expression of pluripotency-associated genes such as NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2; and promote long-term undifferentiated proliferation of human ESCs. We also show that both TGFbeta- and BMP-responsive SMADs can bind with the NANOG proximal promoter. NANOG promoter activity is enhanced by TGFbeta/Activin and FGF signaling and is decreased by BMP signaling. Mutation of putative SMAD binding elements reduces NANOG promoter activity to basal levels and makes NANOG unresponsive to BMP and TGFbeta signaling. These results suggest that direct binding of TGFbeta/Activin-responsive SMADs to the NANOG promoter plays an essential role in sustaining human ESC self-renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2039081870,"Evi-1 has been recognized as one of the dominant oncogenes associated with murine and human myeloid leukemia. Here, we show that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in Evi-1-deficient embryos are severely reduced in number with defective proliferative and repopulating capacity. Selective ablation of Evi-1 in Tie2(+) cells mimics Evi-1 deficiency, suggesting that Evi-1 function is required in Tie2(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitors. Conditional deletion of Evi-1 in the adult hematopoietic system revealed that Evi-1-deficient bone marrow HSCs cannot maintain hematopoiesis and lose their repopulating ability. In contrast, Evi-1 is dispensable for blood cell lineage commitment. Evi-1(+/-) mice exhibit the intermediate phenotype for HSC activity, suggesting a gene dosage requirement for Evi-1. We further demonstrate that disruption of Evi-1 in transformed leukemic cells leads to significant loss of their proliferative activity both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, Evi-1 is a common and critical regulator essential for proliferation of embryonic/adult HSCs and transformed leukemic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014550839,"Although integrin beta(3) is known to play an important role in melanoma progression and invasion, regulation of integrin beta(3) expression in melanoma has not been analysed in detail until today. As transcriptional regulation of integrin beta(3) was ruled out by our analysis, we concentrated on the regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs). Comparing primary melanocytes and malignant melanoma cell lines, we found that one candidate miRNA, miR-let-7a, was lost in melanoma and sequence analysis suggested an interaction with the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of integrin beta(3) mRNA. Transfection of melanoma cells with let-7a pre-miR(TM) molecules resulted in the downregulation of integrin beta(3) mRNA and protein expression. In addition, we cloned the 3'-UTR of the integrin beta(3) mRNA containing the let-7a target sequence into a reporter plasmid and revealed that let-7a negatively regulates reporter gene expression. The repressed expression of integrin beta(3) accompanies with reduced invasive potential of melanoma cells transfected with synthetic let-7a molecules observed in Boyden chamber assays. On the other hand, the induction of integrin beta(3) expression was achieved in melanocytes by transfection with let-7a anti-miRs, resulting in invasive behavior of transfected melanocytes. In summary, we determined miRNA let-7a to be an important regulator of integrin beta(3) expression and showed that the loss of let-7a expression is involved in development and progression of malignant melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2001637781,"Geleophysic dysplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, thick skin and cardiac valvular anomalies often responsible for an early death. Studying six geleophysic dysplasia families, we first mapped the underlying gene to chromosome 9q34.2 and identified five distinct nonsense and missense mutations in ADAMTSL2 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin repeats-like 2), which encodes a secreted glycoprotein of unknown function. Functional studies in HEK293 cells showed that ADAMTSL2 mutations lead to reduced secretion of the mutated proteins, possibly owing to the misfolding of ADAMTSL2. A yeast two-hybrid screen showed that ADAMTSL2 interacts with latent TGF-beta-binding protein 1. In addition, we observed a significant increase in total and active TGF-beta in the culture medium as well as nuclear localization of phosphorylated SMAD2 in fibroblasts from individuals with geleophysic dysplasia. These data suggest that ADAMTSL2 mutations may lead to a dysregulation of TGF-beta signaling and may be the underlying mechanism of geleophysic dysplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2013912082,"In this study, we explore endoderm cell fate regulation through the expression of lineage-determining transcription factors. We demonstrate that stable endoderm progenitors can be established from human ES cells by constitutive expression of SOX7 or SOX17, producing extraembryonic endoderm and definitive endoderm progenitors, respectively. In teratoma assays and growth factor-mediated differentiation, SOX7 cells appear restricted to the extraembryonic endoderm, and SOX17 cells demonstrate a mesendodermal phenotype in teratomas and the ability to undergo endoderm maturation in vitro in the absence of cytokine-mediated endoderm induction. These endoderm progenitor cells maintain a stable phenotype through many passages in culture, thereby providing new tools to explore the pathways of endoderm differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2024449289,"Malignant melanomas often harbor activating mutations in BRAF (V600E) or, less frequently, in NRAS (Q61R). Intriguingly, the same mutations have been detected at higher incidences in benign nevi, which are largely composed of senescent melanocytes. Overexpression of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R in human melanocytes in vitro has been shown to induce senescence, although via different mechanisms. How oncogene-induced senescence is overcome during melanoma progression remains unclear. Here, we report that in the majority of analysed BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-expressing melanoma cells, C-MYC depletion induced different yet overlapping sets of senescence phenotypes that are characteristic of normal melanocytes undergoing senescence due to overexpression of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R, respectively. These senescence phenotypes were p16INK4A- or p53-independent, however, several of them were suppressed by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BRAFV600E or phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways, including rapamycin-mediated inhibition of mTOR-raptor in NRASQ61R-expressing melanoma cells. Reciprocally, overexpression of C-MYC in normal melanocytes suppressed BRAFV600E-induced senescence more efficiently than NRASQ61R-induced senescence, which agrees with the generally higher rates of activating mutations in BRAF than NRAS gene in human cutaneous melanomas. Our data suggest that one of the major functions of C-MYC overexpression in melanoma progression is to continuous suppress BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-dependent senescence programs."
https://openalex.org/W1989901669,"Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in American men. We have previously demonstrated that Src mediates androgen-independent proliferation in prostate cancer. We sought to investigate the Src-mediated oncogenic pathways and tumor biology using AZD0530, a novel Src family kinase/Abl dual-kinase inhibitor that is entering phase II clinical trials. We show that while both Src and Abl are expressed in all prostate cancer cell lines, Src but not Abl is activated in the prostate. Furthermore, Src activation is inhibited by AZD0530 in a rapid and dose-dependent manner. We show that Src mediates cell proliferation in DU145 and PC3 cells at the G1 phase of cell cycle. Src inhibition resulted in decreased binding of β-catenin to the promoters of G1 phase cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and c-Myc. C-Myc may also be regulated at the protein level by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and GSK3β. Cell motility factors focal adhesion kinase, p130CAS and paxillin activation in DU145 and PC3 cells were also inhibited. Administration of AZD0530 in mice reduced orthotopic DU145 xenograft growth by 45%. We have further delineated the Src-mediated oncogenic growth and migration pathways in prostate cancer and established mechanistic rationale for Src inhibition as novel therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2011386434,"The life span of model organisms can be modulated by environmental conditions that influence cellular metabolism, oxidation, or DNA integrity. The yeast nicotinamidase gene pnc1 was identified as a key transcriptional target and mediator of calorie restriction and stress-induced life span extension. PNC1 is thought to exert its effect on yeast life span by modulating cellular nicotinamide and NAD levels, resulting in increased activity of Sir2 family class III histone deacetylases. In Caenorhabditis elegans, knockdown of a pnc1 homolog was shown recently to shorten the worm life span, whereas its overexpression increased survival under conditions of oxidative stress. The function and regulation of nicotinamidases in higher organisms has not been determined. Here, we report the identification and biochemical characterization of the Drosophila nicotinamidase, D-NAAM, and demonstrate that its overexpression significantly increases median and maximal fly life span. The life span extension was reversed in Sir2 mutant flies, suggesting Sir2 dependence. Testing for physiological effectors of D-NAAM in Drosophila S2 cells, we identified oxidative stress as a primary regulator, both at the transcription level and protein activity. In contrast to the yeast model, stress factors such as high osmolarity and heat shock, calorie restriction, or inhibitors of TOR and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways do not appear to regulate D-NAAM in S2 cells. Interestingly, the expression of D-NAAM in human neuronal cells conferred protection from oxidative stress-induced cell death in a sirtuin-dependent manner. Together, our findings establish a life span extending the ability of nicotinamidase in flies and offer a role for nicotinamide-modulating genes in oxidative stress regulated pathways influencing longevity and neuronal cell survival."

https://openalex.org/W2148397172,"Involvement of sterols in membrane structural properties has been extensively studied in model systems but rarely assessed in natural membranes and never investigated for the plant plasma membrane (PM). Here, we address the question of the role of phytosterols in the organization of the plant PM. The sterol composition of tobacco BY-2 cell PM was determined by gas chromatography. The cyclic oligosaccharide methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, commonly used in animal cells to decrease cholesterol levels, caused a drastic reduction (50%) in the PM total free sterol content of the plant material, without modification in amounts of steryl-conjugates. Fluorescence spectroscopy experiments using DPH, TMA-DPH, Laurdan, and di-4-ANEPPDHQ indicated that such a depletion in sterol content increased lipid acyl chain disorder and reduced the overall liquid-phase heterogeneity in correlation with the disruption of phytosterol-rich domains. Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin also prevented isolation of a PM fraction resistant to solubilization by nonionic detergents, previously characterized in tobacco, and induced redistribution of the proteic marker of this fraction, NtrbohD, within the membrane. Altogether, our results support the role of phytosterols in the lateral structuring of the PM of higher plant cells and suggest that they are key compounds for the formation of plant PM microdomains."
https://openalex.org/W1983477526,"Our current paradigm for obesity assumes that reduced thermogenic capacity increases susceptibility to obesity, whereas enhanced thermogenic capacity protects against obesity. Here we report that elimination of two major thermogenic pathways encoded by the mitochondrial uncoupling protein (Ucp1) and mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gdm) result in mice with increased resistance to diet-induced obesity when housed at 28 °C, provided prior adaptation occurred at 20 °C. Obesity resistant Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice maintained at 28 °C have increased energy expenditure, in part through conversion of white to brown adipocytes in inguinal fat. Increased oxygen consumption in inguinal fat cell suspensions and the up-regulation of genes of mitochondrial function and fat metabolism indicated increased thermogenic activity, despite the absence of UCP1, whereas liver and skeletal muscle showed no changes in gene expression. Additionally, comparisons of energy expenditure in UCP1-deficient and wild type mice fed an obesogenic diet indicates that UCP1-based brown fat-based thermogenesis plays no role in so-called diet-induced thermogenesis. Accordingly, a new paradigm for obesity emerges in which the inactivation of major thermogenic pathways force the induction of alternative pathways that increase metabolic inefficiency.

Accordingly, a new paradigm for obesity emerges in which the inactivation of major thermogenic pathways force the induction of alternative pathways that increase metabolic inefficiency. Obesity is a disorder of energy homeostasis that results when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. This simplistic relationship belies the complexity of the behavioral and physiological mechanisms underlying phenotypic variability among humans in both energy intake and energy expenditure (1Blundell J. Stubbs J. Bray G. Bouchard C. Handbook of Obesity. 2nd Ed. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2004: 427-460Google Scholar, 2Schutz Y. Jequier E. Bray G. Bouchard C. Handbook of Obesity. 2nd Ed.

A homeostatic model has been developed based on neuroendocrine polypeptides, secreted by peripheral tissues, that act on centers in the hypothalamus to reciprocally regulate feeding behavior and energy expenditure. Although it has been proposed that these neuropeptides act simultaneously to regulate energy intake and expenditure, the thermogenic targets in peripheral tissues are largely unknown (4Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 5Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Seeley R.J. Barsh G.S. Baskin D.G. Leibel R.L.

Indeed, little attention has been given to centrally controlled thermogenic mechanisms that are independent of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), 3The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; DIO, diet-induced obesity; T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; WT, wild type; SERCA, sacroendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase; RER, respiratory exchange ratio. either UCP1, for which there is strong evidence for a role in rodent models of obesity (7Kozak L.P. Harper M.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 339-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), or the UCP homologues that continue to be proposed for mitochondrial uncoupling functions with little supporting evidence (8Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 9Brand M.D. Esteves T.C. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Given the paucity of evidence for UCP1 activity in adult tissues, there is a pressing need to identify novel mechanisms for activating thermogenesis that can be applied to the obesity problem. The uncoupling of mitochondrial substrate oxidation from ATP synthesis by UCP1 in brown adipose tissue is widely recognized for its role in maintaining a normal body temperature during exposure to cold (10Ricquier D. Kader J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 73: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 11Foster D.O. Frydman M.L. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1979; 57: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 12Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, 13Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). There is also strong evidence that inducing UCP1-based thermogenesis through pharmacological or genetic manipulation reduces excessive adiposity (14Gambert S. Ricquier D. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2007; 10: 664-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, these experimentally induced phenotypes may not be indicative of a normal physiological mechanism for the homeostatic maintenance of energy balance. Indeed, the response of UCP1-deficient mice and wild type mice to a high fat diet is strongly affected by ambient temperature. Mutant and wild type mice maintained near thermoneutrality have the same level of adiposity when fed a high fat diet (15Liu X. Rossmeisl M. McClaine J. Riachi M. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, as the ambient temperature declines, the resistance of UCP1-deficient mice to diet-induced obesity (DIO) suggests that alternative thermogenic mechanisms are activated/induced to generate sufficient heat to maintain body temperature. Unlike brown fat thermogenesis, these alternative biochemical and physiological mechanisms appear to be less efficient for the production and distribution of heat, requiring expenditure of more calories to maintain body temperature and thereby indirectly reducing adiposity. Inguinal fat depots in UCP1-deficient mice, acclimated to cold, acquire the morphology of brown adipocytes, with gene expression data indicating an enhanced capacity for β-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria, and altered patterns of protein expression for phospholambans, regulators of the SERCA activity, suggested that a thermogenic mechanisms based upon Ca2+ cycling may have been induced (16Ukropec J. Anunciado R.P. Ravussin Y. Hulver M.W. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31894-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To enhance our ability to detect and evaluate alternative thermogenic mechanisms, we have achieved a further reduction in the endogenous thermogenic capacity of Ucp1 mutant mice by the targeted inactivation of the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (Gdm) (17Brown L.J. Koza R.A. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Marshall L. Fahien L.A. Kozak L.P. MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32892-32898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle has been proposed as a source of metabolic inefficiency, because of the generation of only two instead of three ATPs/mol of NADH generated by glycolysis (18Lardy H. Shrago E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 689-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The protein levels of GDM and the cytoplasmic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are much higher in interscapular brown adipose tissue than any other tissue (19Ratner P.L. Fisher M. Burkart D. Cook J.R. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3576-3579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Koza R.A. Kozak U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that heat production from the glycerol phosphate shuttle is a parallel thermogenic pathway that could independently supplement UCP1 thermogenesis. Here we report that Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice fed a high fat diet are more resistant to dietary obesity than mice lacking either UCP1 or GDM. The resistance of Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice to DIO depends on a prior conditioning at a lower ambient temperature (20 °C). In addition, and most importantly, changes in the inducible thermogenic capacity that reduced DIO were sustained for a period of 10 weeks, even after switching to a higher ambient temperature (28 °C). We propose that in the absence of two recognized heat-generating systems, by being forced to utilize metabolically costly and less efficient alternative thermogenic mechanisms for maintaining body temperature, the Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice become highly resistant to DIO and have increased insulin sensitivity. Animals and Study Design—Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice on a C57BL/6J (B6) genetic background were generated as follows: Gdm-/-·Ucp1+/+ mice were crossed with Gdm+/+·Ucp1-/- to generate the F1 offspring (Gdm+/-·Ucp1+/-) that were intercrossed to generate the F2 mice. The double knock-out (Gdm-Ucp1-/-) mice were fully fertile and maintained by full-sib mating. Only male mice were studied. In the studies conducted, 10–12-week-old mice were single-housed, fed rodent chow (PicoLab Rodent Diet 20; LabDiet, Richmond, IN) ad libitum, and reared at 28 °C ambient temperature. All of the animal experiments were approved by the Pennington Biomedical Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals. Acute Cold Exposure Experiment—Mice previously maintained at 28 °C were exposed to an ambient temperature of 4 °C, and body temperature was measured every 60 min for 3 h with a rectal probe (TH-8; Physitemp Instruments Inc., Clifton, NJ). Cold Adaptation Experiment—Mice maintained at 28 °C for at least 1 week, following a test for acute sensitivity to cold, were then subjected to a slow reduction (2 °C daily) of ambient temperature until the temperature reached 4 °C. The mice were kept at 4 °C for 24–48 h prior to sacrifice. High Fat Diet Experiments—Three studies were conducted in which the mice were fed a high fat diet (D12230; Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). In Experiment 1, the mice fed a high fat diet were reared at 20 °C ambient temperature for 10 weeks and then at 28 °C for another 10 weeks. In Experiment 2, the mice fed a high fat diet were reared at 28 °C ambient temperature for 8 weeks. In Experiment 3, the mice fed a high fat diet were reared at 20 °C ambient temperature for 4 weeks and then at 28 °C for another 4 weeks. Phenotypes of Energy Balance—Body composition was analyzed by NMR (Bruker). Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and physical activity of individual mice were measured in 16-chamber Oxymax lab animal monitoring system, CLAMS (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH), housed in a temperature-controlled incubator. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from tissues homogenized in TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Genomic DNA was removed from total RNA by treating with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). RNA was further purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and protected from RNase degradation by treatment with SUPERase-In (Ambion, Austin, TX). The quality and quantity of the isolated RNA were assessed using a NanoDrop spectrometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed using total RNA with specific primers and probes designed using Primer-Express™, version 2.0.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). TaqMan probes were used for quantification of some target genes using the TaqMan one-step reverse transcriptase PCR mastermix (Applied Biosystems). Other target genes were quantified using SYBR® Green PCR mastermix (Applied Biosystems). All of the gene expression data were normalized to the level of cyclophilin B. Primer and probe sequences are available upon request. Metabolite and Hormone Determinations—Glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were performed after overnight fasting using an intraperitoneal injection of 20% glucose solution (2 g/kg of body weight) or insulin (0.5 IU/kg of body weight; Humulin R, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN). Blood glucose levels were determined using a OneTouch Profile blood glucose meter (LifeScan Inc., Milpitas, CA). Blood triglyceride and ketone levels were measured using a Cardiochek PA Professional meter (HealthCheck Systems, Brooklyn, NY). Serum lactic acid levels were measured using a lactate assay kit (Trinity BioTech, Berkeley Heights, NJ). Tissue triglycerides were measured in chloroform/methanol extracts using the L-type TG H kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Total serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay (Alpco Diagnostics, Salem, NH). Histology of Inguinal Fat—Inguinal fat pads were fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma-Aldrich), and paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined using a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Tissue Oxygen Consumption—Oxygen consumption in inguinal adipose tissue was measured with a Clark-type polarographic oxygen sensor (Oxygraph, Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, UK). Freshly dissected inguinal adipose tissue was finely minced in a freshly oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. All measurements were performed with minced tissue in bovine serum albumin-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4). Basal respiration was monitored for 1–2 min, after which succinate (5 mm) was added, and respiration was measured for 5–7 min. Tissue oxygen consumption was normalized to DNA content, which was quantified using the fluorescent dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258; Sigma) (21Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Unpaired t test was used to compare differences between groups (Statview, version 5.0.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc test was used when more than two groups were compared. Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- Mice Increase Energy Expenditure during Cold Adaptation—To determine whether Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice are able to survive acute cold exposure, wild type and Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice maintained at 28 °C were placed at 4 °C. Wild type mice were fully able to defend their body temperature, whereas 100% of the Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- became hypothermic, with their body temperature dropping to less than 30 °C within 1–3 h of cold exposure (supplemental Table S1). Cold-sensitive mutant mice were immediately returned to a 28 °C ambient temperature and allowed to recover. However, when the ambient temperature of these recovered Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice was gradually reduced at a rate of 2 °C per day, 80–90% of the mice were able to tolerate an ambient temperature of 4 °C (supplemental Table S1). This ability to adapt to cold ambient temperatures resembles our previous findings with the Ucp1-/- mice. Gdm-/- mice are cold tolerant (17Brown L.J. Koza R.A. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Marshall L. Fahien L.A. Kozak L.P. MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32892-32898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), unless they are made hypothyroid (22DosSantos R.A. Alfadda A. Eto K. Kadowaki T. Silva J.E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5469-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice do not appear to have increased cold intolerance compared with Ucp1-/- mice. To determine the mechanism by which Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice are able to survive cold adaptation, we measured energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry. At 28 °C, wild type mice had slightly higher oxygen consumption compared with Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice (Fig. 1A); however, during acclimation to the cold environment, Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- had higher VO2 than wild type mice (Fig. 1B). Because similar increases in VO2 consumption during cold adaptation were observed in our previous studies of cold-adapted Ucp1-/- mice and T3 or leptin-treated Lepob/ob·Ucp1-/- mice, an enhanced capacity to stimulate oxygen consumption over that normally found for wild type mice appears to be an essential requirement for adaptation to the cold. Gene expression analyses of tissues from wild type and Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice showed that, similar to the adaptive response of Ucp1-/- mice (16Ukropec J. Anunciado R.P. Ravussin Y. Hulver M.W.

This induction in gene expression was found in inguinal fat and red and white gastrocnemius skeletal muscle but not in liver (Table 1 and supplemental Tables S2–S5).TABLE 1Summary of gene expression in WT and Gdm–/–·Ucp1–/– mice during cold adaptation with chow diet and with high fat diet for 20 weeks (20 °C for 10 weeks and at 28 °C for 10 weeks) The values in bold type are significantly different at p < 0.05.

Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 23Rothwell N.J. Stock M.J. Nature. 1979; 281: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Accordingly, energy expenditure was expected to be lower in UCP1-deficient mice than in wild type mice fed a high fat-high sucrose diet. In addition, fat oxidation may also be suppressed in the UCP1-deficient mice. We tested this hypothesis and found, that there was no difference in oxygen consumption between wild type and UCP1-deficient mice when they were fed either a low fat chow diet or an obesogenic diet (Fig. 2, A and D). Upon switching to the obesogenic diet, oxygen consumption increased equally in both Ucp1-/- and wild type mice (Fig. 2, A and D). Furthermore, the RER showed the expected drop from ∼0.92 to 0.78 when the fat composition of the diet was increased, and similar to the oxygen consumption data, the values are indistinguishable between Ucp1-/- and wild type mice (Fig. 2, B and D). Accordingly, the experiment showed highly significant effects of diet on both energy expenditure and substrate utilization, but no significant genotype effects (Fig. 2, B–D). Consistent with this energy expenditure data, Ucp1 mRNA levels in the interscapular brown fat of wild type mice fed chow or obesogenic diets at both 28 and 4 °C were not significantly different from each other; if anything the HF diet suppressed Ucp1 mRNA induction when mice were exposed to an ambient temperature of 4 °C for 1 week (Fig. 2E). This evidence does not support the idea that UCP1 is part of a mechanism for diet-induced thermogenesis in mice fed an obesogenic/cafeteria diet; rather, the increase in oxygen consumption when animals switch from a diet high in carbohydrates to one rich in lipids is likely a consequence in the reduction in P/O ratio when fat is metabolized compared with carbohydrate (24Brand M.D. Chien L.F. Ainscow E.K. Rolfe D.F. Porter R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). If it is calorically more costly to maintain body temperature by UCP1-independent thermogenesis, then an additional deletion of a thermogenic pathway should further reduce the development of adiposity. Accordingly, we evaluated the progressive loss of thermogenic mechanisms on the effects of ambient temperature on the development of DIO in wild type, Ucp1-/-, Gdm-/-, and Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice, rationalizing that the deletion of a second thermogenic mechanism would further increase the demand for alternative thermogenesis and increase resistance to DIO. Ten-week-old mutant and wild type mice were fed a high fat diet at an ambient temperature of 20 °C for 10 weeks, and then the ambient temperature was raised to 28 °C for another 10 weeks (Fig. 3). The rate of body weight gain at 20 °C was slower for all genotypes than at 28 °C and more attenuated for the Ucp -/-, Gdm-/-, and Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- than wild type mice (Fig. 3A). The effects of ambient temperature were clearly evident from the variation in the deposition of fat mass (Fig. 3, B and D). The most striking effects of ambient temperature were observed on the severely attenuated body weight and fat mass gain in the Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice when the ambient temperature was raised to 28 °C. Estimates of the rate of increase in fat mass of the four genotypes fed a high fat diet at ambient temperatures of 20 and 28 °C show that at 20 °C wild type mice have the largest rate of increase, whereas Ucp1-/-, Gdm-/-, and Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice were not significantly different from each other (Fig. 3D). However, when the ambient temperature is increased to 28 °C, the rate of fat mass accumulation in wild type mice and Ucp1-/- mice increased at a similar rate, Gdm-/- was slightly slower, whereas the Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice showed only a modest increase in rate from that observed at 20 °C (Fig. 3D). Two-way analysis of variance on the fat mass gain during weeks 11–17 at 28 °C showed that both effects of genotype (p < 0.0001) and time (p < 0.0001) were significant; the interaction between genotype and time was likewise significant (p = 0.0135). When the ambient temperature is increased to 28 °C, the differences in fat mass accumulation during weeks 11–17 in wild type mice (8.4 ± 0.49) and Ucp1-/- mice (8.7 ± 0.46) are similar; Gdm-/- (6.5 ± 0.44) was slightly decreased, whereas the Gdm-/-· Ucp1-/- mice (1.9 ± 0.49) showed a significant decrease in fat mass. Inspection of the data suggests that the UCP1 and GDM phenotypes are synergistic, and they function as parallel thermogenic systems. Elimination of both Gdm and Ucp1 genes resulted in much lower fat mass accumulation than what would be predicted by the additive effect of the single mutants. These data indicate that there is a synergistic effect of the single gene deletions in causing reduced fat mass accumulation in the Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice. Fat-free mass is significantly reduced in GDM-deficient mice and must be considered in calculations of energy expenditure (Fig. 3C). The variation in food intake on the adiposity phenotypes was minor (Fig. 3E), possibly accounting for some of the difference in adiposity between wild type and Ucp1-/- mice but not for the much greater reduction in fat mass of Gdm-/- and Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice. Higher Energy Expenditure in Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- Mice— The striking resistance of Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice to DIO at 28 °C suggested that a difference in energy expenditure might be present even at an ambient temperature near thermoneutrality. Energy expenditure, monitored by indirect calorimetry at temperature transition points during the study (weeks 11 and 12, when ambient temperature was increased from 20 to 28 °C, and weeks 20 and 21, when ambient temperature was again reduced from 28 to 20 °C) showed that the Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice had higher VO2 than wild type mice during both light and dark periods at both ambient temperatures (Fig. 1, C and D, and Table 2). By comparing A and B in Fig. 1, one can deduce that at 28 °C energy expenditure in wild type and Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice is similar, but as the ambient temperature is reduced during the gradual cold adaptation, energy expenditure in Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- becomes higher (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, when mice were fed a high fat diet and maintained at 20 °C during the first 10 weeks, a higher energy expenditure in Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice was expected (Fig. 1C and Table 2). The higher level of energy expenditure of Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice persisted even after the ambient temperature was elevated to 28 °C when assayed during the 11th week (Fig. 1C and Table 2). Unexpectedly, this elevated energy expenditure in Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- continued to the 21st week when the mice were again placed in the metabolic chamber, indicating that significantly higher energy expenditure was sustained in Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice during a period of 10 weeks at 28 °C while they were fed a high fat diet (Fig. 1D and Table 2). This elevated energy expenditure coincided with the severe suppression of DIO in the Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice at 28 °C (Fig. 3A). To assess the continued response of the mice to changes in ambient temperature, the ambient temperature was again reduced to 20 °C during the 21st week, and the expected ambient temperature-dependent increase in energy expenditure was observed both in the wild type and mutant mice (Fig. 1D). This enhanced capacity for energy expenditure was dependent on prior conditioning at 20 °C, because Gdm-/-·Ucp1-/- mice fed a high fat diet at 28 °C and not exposed to 20 °C had comparable levels of obesity as wild type mice (adiposity indexes of 0.45 ± 0.04 versus 0.42 ± 0.07; Fig. 4D) and indistinguishable rates of oxygen consumption (12 h of light, 2.6 ± 0.05 versus 2.5 ± 0.17 ml O2/g fat free mass (FFM)/h, p = 0.290; 12 h of dark, 3.2 ± 0.10 versus 3.0 ± 0.25 ml O2/gm fat free mass (FFM)/h; p = 0.273).TABLE 2Energy expenditure, RER, and physical activity in WT and Gdm–/–·Ucp1–/– mice fed a high fat diet and reared at 20 °C for 10 weeks and then at 28 °C for 10 weeks All of the values represent the means ± S.E. p values are the results of statistical analysis using a Student's t test.TemperatureLight conditionsWT (n = 6)Gdm–/–·Ucp1–/– (n = 7)°CVO2 (ml O2/g of FFM/h)11th week2012 h of light2.9 ± 0.093.3 ± 0.02ap < 0.052012 h of dark3.5 ± 0.133.9 ± 0.05ap < 0.052812 h of light1.8 ± 0.052.1 ± 0.01ap < 0.052812 h of dark2.4 ± 0.012.9 ± 0.04ap < 0.0521st week2812 h of light1.5 ± 0.041.8 ± 0.05ap < 0.052812 h of dark1.8 ± 0.042.3 ± 0.08ap < 0.052012 h of light2.3 ± 0.052.8 ± 0.09ap < 0.052012 h of dark2.7 ± 0.113.3 ± 0.11ap < 0.05RER11th week2012 h of light0.87 ± 0.0080.88 ± 0.0022012 h of dark0.86 ± 0.0070.89 ± 0.007ap < 0.052812 h of light0.93 ± 0.0070.89 ± 0.007ap < 0.052812 h of dark0.91 ± 0.0090.91 ± 0.00921st week2812 h of light0.85 ± 0.0110.86 ± 0.0082812 h of dark0.84 ± 0.0150.87 ± 0.0042012 h of light0.84 ± 0.0060.84 ± 0.0052012 h of dark0.82 ± 0.0010.84 ± 0.010Ambulatory physical activity (total counts)11th week2012 h of light3138 ± 10142624 ± 1052012 h of dark13129 ± 347810512 ± 8112812 h of light2626 ± 5002831 ± 2722812 h of dark10740 ± 279211259 ± 242921st week2812 h of light1757 ± 5801859 ± 3032812 h of dark6465 ± 16607561 ± 11352012 h of light2357 ± 6582685 ± 3822012 h of dark9843 ± 238511076 ± 1149a p < 0.05 Open table in a new tab Despite feeding a high fat diet, significant differences in RER were evident during the dark h at 20 °C and light hours at 28 °C (Table 2, 11th week).

Transporters on neurons and glia clear neurotransmitters and regulate the extent of receptor activation. Among them, glutamate transporters allow cells to maintain a substantial concentration gradient of glutamate (1Amara S.G. Fontana A.C. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In fulfilling this function, each glutamate molecule is co-transported with three sodium ions and one proton followed by the counter-transport of a potassium ion (2Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Binding of substrate and Na+ also activates an uncoupled chloride conductance, and thus, the transporter also functions as a ligand-gated anion channel (3Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P.

Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Glutamate transporters have a major impact on developmental plasticity and long term potentiation, and they have been implicated in many pathological conditions including stroke, epilepsy, cerebral ischemia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and schizophrenia (5Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3760) Google Scholar). However, the molecular interactions and structural mechanisms that mediate the transport of glutamate and co-transported ions have been difficult to resolve in the absence of high resolution structural information for the carrier family. A major breakthrough came with the resolution of the x-ray structure of the archaeal glutamate transporter (GltPh) from Pyrococcus horikoshii under different conditions by Gouaux and co-workers (6Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 7Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). GltPh is a homotrimer (Fig. 1A) with the subunits forming a bowl-shaped concave basin toward the EC side. Each subunit is comprised of eight transmembrane (TM) helices, TM1-TM8, and two helical hairpins, HP1 and HP2 (Fig. 1B), which partially span the lipid bilayer. These structural elements are organized into an N-terminal, outer cylinder region made up of TM helices TM1-TM6 and a C-terminal core comprised of TM7, HP1, HP2, and TM8 (Fig. 1C). The core region is known to encompass the elements of the transport machinery (6Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The crystallographic structural data obtained for GltPh (6Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 7Boudker O. Ryan R.M.

Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) agree, in general, with models based on biochemical and mutagenesis experiments conducted for mammalian excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). For example, biochemical studies on human EAAT2 showed that the transporter exists as a trimer (8Gendreau S. Voswinkel S. Torres-Salazar D. Lang N. Heidtmann H. Detro-Dassen S. Schmalzing G.

Additionally, residues in the mammalian EAATs equivalent to the GltPh residues Asp-394 and Arg-397, the serine-rich motif (Ser-277-Ser-279), and the conserved NMDGT motif have been proposed to be involved in substrate binding (11Bendahan A.

These structural data along with the fact that GltPh shares about 36% sequence identity with eukaryotic EAATs suggest that GltPh and its mammalian orthologues share similar structural and biophysical features. The GltPh structure may, therefore, serve as a prototype for gaining new insights into the molecular interactions and mechanisms of glutamate uptake by the Na+/K+-dependent glutamate transporter family (15Torres G.E. Amara S.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Toward this goal we have performed extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the available GltPh structure in the presence of explicit solvent, lipid molecules, substrate, and ions. We present here the results from an overall run time of 0.20 μs (see Table 1), which may be viewed as a computational tour de force for this large system of ∼100,000 heavy atoms (see Fig. 2).TABLE 1Description of MD runs conducted in the present studyRun IDDurationInitial structure of the transporterTotal no. of atomsaAll simulations were performed with explicit water and lipid molecules and with ions at 310 K.

Open table in a new tab Our study demonstrates that the hairpin HP2 loops possess an intrinsic, structure-induced ability to undergo large scale motions even in the absence of substrate. These motions open up the conserved charged or polar residues in the core regions to the central aqueous basin. Exposure of these residues prompts the directed diffusion of substrate toward the putative binding site, provided that the substrate is located within an interaction range in the basin. The intrinsic, structure-induced ability of GltPh to sample the conformational motions that facilitate substrate binding conforms to the functional dynamics observed both experimentally and computationally for many allosteric enzymes and receptors (16Tobi D.

Additionally, simulations permit us to visualize the sequence of events that lead to the sequestering of the substrate at the binding site as well as the important role of bound Na+ in controlling EC gate motion and ensuring the tight confinement of the substrate in the core. A well defined pathway is identified where water molecules enter the binding site in single file via a passage between two highly conserved aspartates, Asp-390 and Asp-394, on TM8. Binding of a water molecule to Thr-314 on the NMDGT motif plays a key role in mediating the cooperative rearrangement of amino acids that coordinate the bound substrate. Finally, the residue Leu-303 on TM7 (Leu-391 in hEAAT1) appears to serve as a binding site for Na+. We tested this possibility by examining the Na+ dependence of transport for two human EAAT1 (hEAAT1) mutants (L391A and L391C). The results from these experiments support the significance of this newly defined site for Na+ binding/uptake. Overall, the present structure-based simulations and experiments shed light for the first time on the time-resolved mechanisms of EC gate opening, substrate recognition, and binding and the role of Na+ in modulating the structural dynamics of the transporter. MD Simulations—We simulated the dynamics of GltPh embedded in a bilayer-solvent environment (Fig. 2) using the GROMACS program 3.2.1 with the Gromacs force field (20Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of GltPh (6Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) was used as the initial conformation (PDB code 1xfh). Missing atoms on the side chains of some residues were constructed using Xplor (20Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). Constant number of particles (N), pressure (P), and temperature (T) conditions, with a pressure of 1 bar and a coupling constant of τp = 1.0 ps, were adopted. Water, protein, and lipid molecules were coupled separately to a temperature bath at 310 K using a coupling constant of τt = 0.1 ps. The van der Waals interactions were calculated using a cutoff distance of 10 Å, and long range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method. The single point charge model was adopted for water molecules as a plausible model for lipid simulations (21Berendsen H. VanderSpoel D. VanDrunen R. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7186) Google Scholar, 22Tieleman D.P. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Chem. Phys. 1996; 105: 4871-4880Crossref Scopus (461) Google Scholar) along with the lipid parameters used in our previous MD simulations of other membrane proteins (23Shrivastava I.H. Sansom M.S. Biophys.

The membrane consisted of 353 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine molecules, and the system was solvated with ∼23,000 water molecules. Simulations were preceded by energy minimization with steepest descent followed by equilibration periods of 200 ps during which the protein backbone atoms were restrained by harmonic potentials so as to allow for the packing of lipid molecules around the protein. The constraints were then removed for the productive runs. Table 1 provides a summary of MD runs. MD0 was performed to examine the intrinsic dynamics of the transporter. MD1 and MD2 were generated to examine the substrate binding events using two different initial positions for the substrate (4.5 and 8.8 Å away from the base of the basin, respectively, along the central cylindrical (z) axis). The substrate was seen to drift away to the EC region in the first 1-ns portion of the MD2 trajectory. This was prevented by applying on the substrate backbone nitrogen an acceleration of 10 nm/ps2 along the z direction, toward the basin, similar to the approach used in other applications (25Wriggers W. Schulten K. Proteins. 1999; 35: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Jensen M.O. Park S. Tajkhorshid E. Schulten K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The acceleration had no radial component and was turned off after 1 ns to observe the intermolecular interactions that drive substrate diffusion. The role of sodium ions was examined in the runs MD3 and MD4. MD5 and MD6 were conducted to examine and compare the diffusive properties of aspartate and glutamate at physiological levels in the EC and intracellular (IC) regions. Supplemental Fig. S1 displays the time evolution of the root-mean-square deviation in atomic coordinates relative to starting structure, observed in MD0 (A), MD5 (B), and MD6 (C) for the three subunits. The average deviation in the atomic coordinates of the subunits remains lower than 3.5 Å in MD0 and 4.2 Å in MD5 and MD6, i.e. the overall structure is highly stable in the time frame of simulations. Largest motions occur at the loops and at TM4 (supplemental Fig. S2). Mutagenesis and Sodium Dependence Assay—Mutants L391A and L391C were made using site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) based on a cysteine-less (CSLS) version of human EAAT1(CSLS) (28Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1998; 28: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PCR products were subcloned into pCMV5 vector and sequenced by dye terminator cycle sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). COS-7 cells were passaged and plated into a 24-well plate and transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Uptake assays were performed 2 days after transfection. Cells were incubated with 5 μm l-[3H]glutamate (50 nm l-[3H]glutamate and 4.95 μm unlabeled l-glutamate) in different Na+ concentrations (140, 60, 30, 10 mm) for 10 min at room temperature. The uptake buffer contained 140 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm Tris-H3PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4). Choline chloride was used as the replacement for NaCl in the buffers containing reduced Na+ concentrations. Cells were lysed in 0.1% SDS and counted in a scintillation counter. Cells transfected with pCMV5 vector served as a control for endogenous l-glutamate uptake under all conditions. Km and Vmax values were derived by the Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism 4.0 (Graphpad). Intrinsic Dynamics of the Transporter in the Absence of Substrate and Spontaneous Opening of HP2 Loop—The first set of simulations (MD0; Table 1) was performed in the absence of substrate in order to investigate the dynamics of the transporter before substrate binding. Fig. 3 illustrates the results. The most striking motions observed in these simulations are the large amplitude fluctuations of the HP2 loop away from the HP1 loop toward the aqueous basin. This type of motion is evidenced by the change in the distance between residues Ser-278 and Gly-354 at the tips of the respective hairpins HP1 and HP2 (panel A). In the closed (starting) conformation the distance between the hydrogen bond-forming backbone nitrogen and oxygen on the respective residues Gly-354 and Ser-278 is 1.90 ± 0.25 Å in all three subunits (panel B). Strikingly, an increase of more than 8 Å was observed in subunit A (black curve in Fig. 3, panel A) succeeding the reconfiguration of the HP2 loop, which literally acts as an “EC gate.” Subunit B (red in Fig. 3A) exhibits a displacement of about 7 Å at 17 ns, whereas subunit C (green) remains closed throughout the entire duration of the run MD0. Once the original tight packing of the two hairpins in the core is disrupted, the HP2 loop tends to remain open and disordered as indicated by the large fluctuations in the HP1-HP2 distance time profile for both subunits A and B. The opening of HP2 loop is illustrated in the snapshots of subunit A at three successive times in Fig. 3C and in supplemental Movie 1 and Fig. S3. Largest motions occur at the loop residues Ala-353-Gly-359 between the helical branches HP2a and HP2b of HP2. This loop contains four highly conserved glycines, Gly-351, -354, -357, and -359. Conceivably, these glycines play a dual role of (i) facilitating the sampling of entropically favored (disordered) conformations (open state of the EC gate) by providing access to a broad range of rotameric angles φ and ψ and (ii) assisting in the stabilization of the substrate through exposure of their backbone polar groups and opening up a cavity (Fig. 3D) that will bind the substrate. The propagation of the motion of the HP2 loop to the helical segment HP2a is restrained by its tertiary contacts with TM7. In particular, the interhelical contacts between Gly-354 (HP2 tip) and Ile-309 (TM7) and between Ala-345 (HP2a) and Gln-318 (TM7) limit the motion of HP2 from two ends, thus preventing the wide opening of the EC gate. See Fig. 1C for the position of these residues in the core domain. Supplemental Fig. S3 shows the high stability of the contacts between Gln-318 and the near neighboring residues on HP2a, supporting a role of Gln-318 in controlling the EC gating. The tendency of the HP2 loop to dissociate from the HP1 loop and interact instead with the aqueous environment is invariably confirmed in three independent runs, MD0, MD5, and MD6. In each case, one or more subunit(s) exhibited this structure-induced tendency to “open up” (Fig. 4), apparently yielding to the competing effect of water molecules that disrupt the interaction between the HP1 and HP2 tips. Note that both helices TM7 and TM8 are partially unwound at this region, and the manifested mobility may partly result from the need to release the internal strain or to satisfy these “frustrated” structural elements including in particular the 310NMDGT314 motif on TM7, as will be further elaborated below. The time profiles in Fig. 4, A-C, show that the transition of HP2 from closed to open form is an abrupt change, suggestive of a conformational “switch.” The onset of the first opening varies from 1.5 ns (MD0, subunit A) to 15 ns (MD5, subunit C). No net correlation was detected between the opening events of the individual subunits. The occurrence of two “states,” open and closed, is also supported by the histograms in panels A′-C′. A bimodal distribution is seen therein for the distance between the tips of HP1 and HP2 loops. The narrow peak around 2 Å refers to the closed form. The open form, on the other hand, samples a broad range of distances, consistent with its disordered state. Diffusion of Glutamate toward the Binding Site—The cavity that opens up to the aqueous basin upon EC gating (Fig. 3D) contains charged/polar residues (e.g. Arg-276 and Ser-277-Ser-279 on HP1 and the NMDGT motif on TM7, all conserved among different subtypes of EAATs) with a high affinity for attracting the substrate. HP2, thus, serves not only as an EC gate permitting the entry of the neurotransmitter but also as an attractor driving the diffusion of the substrate toward the binding site. Next, we explored the possibility of such a directed diffusion of the substrate toward the putative binding site between HP1 and HP2 tips. To address this issue, we performed the runs MD1 and MD2 using as initial conformation an open form of the transporter, e.g. the conformation visited at 5 ns in MD0 where subunit A was open (see Fig. 3). The glutamate was observed to spontaneously move toward the open subunit (subunit A) and slide into the putative binding site in between HP1 and HP2 (Figs. 5 and 6 and supplemental Movie 2) within a nanosecond when it was placed at a position sufficiently distant from the EC region in the aqueous basin. Note that the original radial distance between the glutamate substrate and the closest residues on HP2 was more than 20 Å in both of these simulations and decreases to less than 2 Å within 1 ns (Fig. 5). Moreover, the recognition of the substrate by the open subunit A and the radial diffusion of the substrate toward this particular subunit are achieved without exerting any external forces/biases in that direction but as a result of the long-range attraction exerted by the polar/charged groups exposed to the basin upon HP2 opening.FIGURE 6Succession of events leading to substrate binding. Snapshots at different times (as indicated by gray boxes) are displayed to illustrate the time-resolved recognition and binding events. At t = 0, the unbound substrate (encircled) is in the aqueous cavity, whereas HP2 loop of subunit A samples an open conformation that exposes polar and charged residues on HP1 tip. At t = 0.55 ns, the substrate has moved closer toward the HP2 tip to recognize Gly-354. At t = 1.0 ns, it simultaneously interacts with two glycines (Gly-354 and Gly-357) on HP2 tip. At t = 1.5 it occupies an intermediate position between HP1 and HP2 tips, starting to interact with the Ser-277—Ser-278—Ser-279 motif on HP1. At t = 7.5 ns, the substrate dissociates from HP2 and interacts with HP1 tip residues as well as TM7 and TM8 residues (see Fig. 5). The substrate remains sequestered at the binding site for the remaining duration of MD1 run.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The runs MD1 and MD2 demonstrate that the substrate is readily driven toward the open subunit provided that it reaches a relatively deeper position in the basin. Next, we investigated the diffusion of the substrate from the outside (EC region) to the basin. To this aim we conducted two runs, MD5 and MD6, with glutamate and aspartate molecules included at random positions in the EC and IC regions but not in the basin. We also included in the bulk environment sodium, potassium, and chloride ions at physiological levels. No substrate molecule was observed to diffuse to the basin, although the simulations were extended up to 50 ns in each case. These results suggest that the diffusion of the substrate from the EC region to the interior of the basin could be a rate-limiting process in substrate binding. Once the substrate enters the basin, on the other hand, it takes only nanoseconds to “see” the open hairpin HP2 and diffuse to this highly attractive region to reach a low energy state. We note that the runs MD0 and MD6 differ not only in their concentrations of substrate but also in the ionic strength of the environment. Because MD6 was conducted with near-physiological concentrations of ions (Na+, K+, and Cl-) (Table 1), the comparison with MD0 may provide insights into the effect of ionic strength on conformational dynamics. The corresponding histograms of conformers (closed and open) in panels A′ and C′ of Fig. 4 exhibit little difference, if any, between the two runs, consistent with the concept that the EC gating is predominantly controlled by the intrinsic dynamics of the protein. However, a closer examination (essential dynamics analysis (29Amadei A. Linssen A.B. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2613) Google Scholar)) of all trajectories in the context of the Na+ effect on substrate binding clearly shows how the subunit mobilities tend to be enhanced with higher concentrations of ions in the bulk. The left two panels in supplementary Fig. S4 display the dispersion of the modes obtained from the runs MD0 and MD6 for the hairpin HP1 (dotted) and HP2 (solid) in the three subunits A (black), B (red), and C (green). The ordinate provides a measure of the amplitudes of motions driven by the individual modes (rank-ordered along the abscissa, starting from the lowest frequency mode). Clearly, the HP2 hairpin in the subunit that opens up (A, black) exhibits the largest mobility in the slowest mode compared with the other subunits, and these differences in mobility vanish at higher modes. What is remarkable, however, is the significant enhancement in the mobility of the same subunit in the medium with the higher ionic strength (compare the root mean square amplitude of ∼6.5 Å in MD6 and 3.5 Å in MD0 in mode 1). The right panels refer to the effect of Na+ binding on the HP1 and HP2 mobilities after substrate binds to the transporter, which will be discussed below. Sequence of Events Leadin"
https://openalex.org/W2006316634,"Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is an aggressive skeletal muscle cancer of childhood. Our initial studies of rhabdomyosarcoma gene expression for patients enrolled in a national clinical trial suggested that platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFR-A) may be a mediator of disease progression and metastasis. Using our conditional mouse tumor models that authentically recapitulate the primary mutations and metastatic progression of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas in humans, we found by immunoblotting and immunokinase assays that PDGFR-A and its downstream effectors, mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt, were highly activated in both primary and metastatic tumors. Inhibition of PDGFR-A by RNA interference, small molecule inhibitor or neutralizing antibody had a dramatic effect on tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, although resistance evolved in one-third of tumors. These results establish proof-of-principal for PDGFR-A as a therapeutic target in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma."

Oct-1 binds the essential octamer site in the H2B promoter throughout the interphase; however, OCA-S occupies the H2B promoter only in the S-phase (10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). A direct Oct-1-p38/GAPDH interaction and H2B transcription are modulated by NAD(H) in vitro (10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This implicates a redox-modulated H2B expression in vivo and potentially links the redox status (metabolic states) of the cell to gene switching. Quite common in prokaryotes, such links have been rarely reported in higher eukaryotes (12.Shi Y. Shi Y. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that a proper NAD+/NADH redox status (ratio) is important for optimal H2B expression both in vitro and in vivo. The direct Oct-1-p38/GAPDH interaction plays a role nucleating the H2B promoter occupancy by OCA-S, which dictates the redox-modulated H2B transcription. p36/LDH is also essential for H2B expression in vivo and plays a critical role in the hierarchical organization of OCA-S. Finally, the OCA-S-associated p36/LDH possesses an intrinsic catalytic activity that exerts an impact upon H2B transcription. Our studies suggest that the nuclear moonlighting transcription functions of metabolic enzymes can be modulated by the cellular redox status, which directly links gene switching to the cellular metabolic states in higher eukaryotes.

Real-time PCR Assay—Sybr Green Core Reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used in the real-time PCR assays to quantify histone mRNA levels normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. B Cell Nuclear Extract (NE)-based Transcription Mixture—A B cell NE (in buffer BC-100, 100 mm KCl) was passed through a P11 phosphocellulose column equilibrated in BC-100, and the column washed with BC-100. General transcription factor IIA, purified from the flow-through fraction, was reconstituted with BC-300, BC-500, and BC-1,000 (mm KCl) fractions (10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y.

This procedure removed the pre-existing redox components, resulting in the B cell NE-based transcription mixture containing an intact set of transcription factors that support IgH and H2B transcription and allowed the modulation of the H2B transcription by (low level) exogenous NAD(H) in vitro (Ref. 10.Zheng L.

The beads were made in 50% slurries. Then, 10 μl of the B cell NE-based transcription mixture and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), and NAD(H), when appropriate, were mixed in 25 μl and incubated with the immobilized DNA slurries. The beads were then extensively washed, and the bound proteins further analyzed by immunoblot and enzyme assays. GAPDH and LDH Enzyme Assays—1 μl of the B cell NE-based transcription mixture, or 1 milliunit of GAPDH or LDH, was mixed with streptavidin-agarose beads (25 μl in 50% slurries), as was the H2B promoter-bound OCA-S in the beads (see above). For the LDH enzyme reaction, slurries were mixed with 25 μl of transcription buffer with 2 mm each of NAD+, NADH, and sodium pyruvate, and for the GAPDH enzyme reaction, 2 mm each of NAD+, NADH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and KH2AsO4. The generated or consumed NADH levels were recorded on a fluorometer (340 nm excitation, 460 nm emission). Evaluations of Free Cellular NAD+/NADH Ratios (Redox Status) and Total NAD+, NADH, or ATP Levels—Free NAD+/NADH ratios were scored on the premise that the coenzymes are in equilibrium with real-time pyruvate and lactate levels (16.Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 17.Fulco M. Schiltz R.L. Iezzi S. King M.T. Zhao P. Kashiwaya Y. Hoffman E. Veech R.L. Sartorelli V. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Thus, cells were lysed with 1 m perchloric acid to stop all metabolism and the lysate neutralized for enzymatic assays. A reaction for determining the pyruvate level contained 100 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 40 μm NADH, 4 units/ml LDH, and a lysate titration. A reaction for determining the lactate level contained a lysate titration, 450 mm glycine (pH 9.5), 200 mm hydrazine sulfate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 120 μm NAD+, and 8 units/ml LDH. All reactions were carried out at 25 °C for 30 min. All generated or consumed NADH levels were recorded on a fluorometer (340-nm excitation, 460-nm emission). The total cellular NAD+ or NADH levels were determined by established assays (18.Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis. A Practical Guide. Humana Press, NJ1993: 85-110Crossref Google Scholar). Cellular ATP levels were scored by the ATPlite™ Luminescence Assay System from PerkinElmer. BrdU-FACS Analyses—Cells grown in 6-well plates were treated with BrdU (10 μm) for 45 min before harvesting, fixed with 70% cold ethanol, treated with 3 n HCl, washed, and incubated with the mouse anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody for 30 min. After washing, cells were incubated with the Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Finally, cells were treated with propidium iodide and RNase A for 30 min and subjected to FACS analyses. Luciferase Assays in Xenopus Oocytes and HeLa Cells—Increasing NAD+, p38/GAPDH (or bovine serum albumin), and an H2B promoter-luciferase (firefly) reporter (2.Zhao J. Kennedy B.K. Lawrence B.D. Barbie D.A. Matera A.G. Fletcher J.A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2283-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) were co-injected into oocyte nuclei (10 nl per nucleus, 1.4 ng of protein). At 40 h, the oocytes were lysed to measure the luciferase activities. To assess the effects of redox perturbations on H2B promoter in vivo, HeLa cells were transfected with the H2B promoter-luciferase reporter, treated with NaN3 overnight, and then harvested to measure the luciferase activities. In both assays, the internal reference was a Renilla luciferase gene driven by the SV40 promoter. The reference activities were largely constant, which further supports H2B promoter specificity of redox effects (see “Results”). Biphasic Response of H2B Transcription to Varied NAD+/ NADH Redox Status—It was earlier shown that in an NE-based transcription system in which the pre-existing redox components were removed, the H2B transcription was stimulated by exogenous NAD+ and inhibited by NADH (tested up to 0.4 mm; Ref. 10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The current study used the B cell NE-based transcription mixture, in which the pre-existing redox components were also removed chromatographically (“Experimental Procedures”). We tested a broader NAD+ titration and observed a biphasic response: the H2B transcription was stimulated by NAD+ up to 1 mm but inhibited by NAD+ at higher dosages (Fig. 1A). NADH was always inhibitory (Fig. 1B). Mixing 1 mm NAD+ with additional NAD+ or with NADH repressed the NAD+-stimulated H2B transcription (Fig. 1C). In vivo, (free) NAD+/NADH ratios define the redox status, prompting us to study whether a range of NAD+/NADH ratios may modulate H2B transcription in vitro. Increasing NAD+ on top of 0.4 mm NADH stimulated H2B transcription (up to a 4:1 ratio; Fig. 1D, lane 8) but higher ratios had opposite effects. At a constant dosage of NAD(H) (2 mm), in vitro H2B transcription was enhanced by increasing the ratios up to 1:1 (Fig. 1E, lane 5), and higher ratios had opposite effects. OCA-S abets the role of an octamer-bound Oct-1 to regulate H2B transcription (10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar); thus, the transcriptional output should correlate with the H2B promoter occupancy by OCA-S (through a direct Oct-1-p38/GAPDH interaction; see Fig. 2). With the same set of NAD+/NADH ratios used for in vitro transcription (Fig. 1E), we tested the H2B promoter occupancy by the OCA-S complex in an immobilized H2B promoter pull-down assay. As seen (Fig. 1F), while the recruitment of Oct-1 to the H2B promoter was largely constant, that of the OCA-S components exhibited a biphasic pattern. This is in line with the biphasic H2B transcription pattern (Fig. 1E). Hence, the NAD+/ NADH ratio (redox status) may modulate the H2B transcription via regulating the OCA-S recruitment to the H2B promoter through the octamer-bound Oct-1. p38/GAPDH, microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, was shown to activate an ectopic H2B gene (19.Morgenegg G. Winkler G.C. Hubscher U. Heizmann C.W. Mous J. Kuenzle C.C. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This offers a more physiological assay to examine an NAD+ response for Oct-1-dependent H2B promoter co-activation. We microinjected an H2B promoter-luciferase reporter, p38/GAPDH, and NAD+ into the oocytes, and recapitulated a biphasic luciferase reporter expression in responding to increasing NAD+ (Fig. 1G). Results in Fig. 1 prompted us to conclude that optimal H2B transcription in vitro requires a proper NAD+/NADH ratio (redox status) and that maximal H2B transcription in Xenopus oocytes is ensured by a proper NAD+ level. A Nucleating Role of p38/GAPDH for the OCA-S Function—The role(s) of NAD(H) in H2B transcription in vitro is consistent with co-existing p38/GAPDH and p36/LDH in OCA-S (Ref. 10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). p38/GAPDH directly interacts with Oct-1 (10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and may be central in regulating H2B transcription by sensing the redox changes that modulate an Oct-1-OCA-S interaction (Fig. 1, also see below). First, we immunodepleted p38/GAPDH from the B cell NE-based transcription mixture under 500 mm KCl high salt conditions, which allowed for depletion of one OCA-S component while keeping others intact in the depleted samples (Ref. 10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar and Fig. 2A; also see below). Then we carried out a subsequent immobilized H2B promoter pull-down assay (Fig. 2B). The binding of Oct-1 to the H2B promoter was constant (all lanes) and that of OCA-S components was inhibited by NADH and stimulated by NAD+ (1 mm) in the control (lanes 1–3). In the p38/GAPDH-depleted B cell NE-based transcription mixture, however, the binding of other components was impeded (lanes 4–6). In line with the above promoter recruitment patterns, H2B transcription in vitro was similarly modulated by exogenous NAD(H) at 1 mm level (Fig. 2C, top panel). Given that an octamer mutant (H2B Mut) template was not redox-sensitive (Fig. 2C; bottom panel), the NAD(H) redox effects did not target the basal H2B transcription. In addition, NAD(H) were not converted to other metabolites nor interconverted in the in vitro reactions (Fig. 2D). This suggests primary or direct, and NAD(H)-specific, redox effects. The above results suggest that, by sensing the NAD+/NADH redox, p38/GAPDH nucleates an Oct-1-OCA-S interaction as a key regulatory step for the H2B transcription in vitro. The redox effect is on an Oct-1-p38/GAPDH interaction, but not on an Oct-1-octamer interaction or the H2B basal transcription machinery. In living cells, the Oct-1-p38/GAPDH interaction is likely subject to direct redox-modulation as well, which determines the H2B transcription output in vivo (see below). Essential and Redox-modulator Roles of p36/LDH for H2B Transcription—p38/GAPDH (10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), p36/LDH (Fig. 3A) and other tested OCA-S components (not shown) are essential for H2B transcription in living cells. Given a cytoplasmic interaction between GAPDH and LDH (20.Svedruzić Z.M. Spivey H.O. Proteins. 2006; 63: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a similar p38/GAPDH-p36/LDH interaction within OCA-S may help tether an intact OCA-S complex to the H2B promoter. This might help explain the essential role of p36/LDH for H2B expression in vivo. To support the above notion, we carried out immobilized H2B promoter pull-down assays in the B cell NE-based transcription mixture. In the p36/LDH-depleted sample, promoter occupancy by p20/nm23-H1, p18/nm23-H2, and p60/Sti1 was impeded as opposed to the normal and NAD+-enhanced recruitment of OCA-S in the mock-depleted sample (Fig. 3B). In the p60/Sti1-depleted sample, the recruitment of p36/LDH and p38/GAPDH to the H2B promoter was normal but the recruitment of p20/nm23-H1 and p18/nm23-H2 was impeded (Fig. 3C). Hence, p36/LDH is essential as an OCA-S component that helps tether an intact OCA-S complex to the H2B promoter. This is most likely through a direct interaction between p38/GAPDH and p36/LDH within OCA-S; however, the possibility that the interaction is mediated by other untested OCA-S component(s) is not yet excluded. p38/GAPDH along with p36/LDH did not exercise glycolytic activities in the reactions in the B cell NE-based transcription mixture, because NAD(H) was not converted to other metabolites or interconverted (Fig. 2D); however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the two essential OCA-S components, while associated in OCA-S, might have catalytic activities that are able to feedback to H2B transcription if provided substrates. Under optimized conditions, immobilized H2B promoter pull-down assays allowed for 10–20% recruitment of OCA-S (Fig. 3D). We found that the H2B promoter-bound OCA-S exhibited an enzyme activity for p36/LDH, which was as potent as the input (the B cell NE-based transcription mixture); however, we have failed to detect any intrinsic enzyme activity for p38/GAPDH, which was marginal even in the input (Fig. 3E). This suggests that the OCA-S intrinsic enzyme activity for p36/LDH, which uses NADH as a coenzyme (to be re-oxidized to NAD+) to convert pyruvate to lactate, can impact H2B transcription. Indeed, the H2B transcription in vitro inhibited by 1 mm NADH was relieved and stimulated by pyruvate in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3F, top panel), accompanied by the pyruvate-facilitated NADH to NAD+ re-oxidation (Fig. 3F, bottom panel). Disrupting NAD+Biosynthesis Inhibits H2B Expression in Living Cells—The belief that optimal H2B transcription in vitro requires a proper NAD+/NADH ratio (redox status) (Fig. 1) prompted studies on the roles of the NAD+/NADH redox status for H2B expression in living cells. ∼80% mammalian NAD+ is derived from a two-step biosynthesis (21.Rongvaux A. Andris F. Van Gool F. Leo O. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar): the cytoplasmic nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) converts precursor nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide, which is converted to NAD+ by the enzyme family nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl-transferases (Nmnat, of which Nmnat-1 is a nuclear isozyme). Therefore, silencing the expression of Nampt or Nmnat-1 can deplete the cellular or nuclear NAD+ pool, allowing us to study a role of NAD+ for H2B expression in vivo. We used siRNAs (nos. 1 or 2) targeting two Nampt mRNA regions to silence its expression in HeLa cells via RNAi (13.Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses of the extracts of the siRNA-treated cells showed ∼90% knock-down with either siRNA (Fig. 4A). RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR showed reduced H2B expression (Fig. 4B) in the Nampt-depleted cells, which exhibited a reduced free cellular NAD+/NADH ratio (Fig. 4C) or total NAD(H) levels (Fig. 4D). These results link H2B expression in vivo to the NAD+/NADH ratio or the overall (total) NAD(H) levels. We then silenced the Nmnat-1 expression, which has been implicated in certain functions by maintaining a nuclear NAD+ pool (22.Mack T.G. Reiner M. Beirowski B. Mi W. Emanuelli M. Wagner D. Thomson D. Gillingwater T. Court F. Conforti L. Fernando F.S. Tarlton A. Andressen C. Addicks K. Magni G. Ribchester R.R. Perry V.H. Coleman M.P. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 23.Araki T. Sasaki Y. Millbrandt J. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). HeLa cells treated with Nmnat-1-specific siRNAs (nos. 1 or 2) exhibited just partial silencing (Fig. 4E) with reduced H2B mRNA levels (Fig. 4F) and free cellular NAD+/ NADH ratios (Fig. 4G). However, the control or Nmnat-1-depleted cells exhibited no difference in the total cellular NAD(H) levels (Fig. 4H). This is in line with the fact that the normal, Nmnat-1-null, or Nmnat-1-overexpressing cells behaved similarly in this regard (22.Mack T.G. Reiner M. Beirowski B. Mi W. Emanuelli M. Wagner D. Thomson D. Gillingwater T. Court F. Conforti L. Fernando F.S. Tarlton A. Andressen C. Addicks K. Magni G. Ribchester R.R. Perry V.H. Coleman M.P. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 23.Araki T. Sasaki Y. Millbrandt J. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Because of certain technical limitations, there is no direct assessment of the free NAD+/NADH ratios, or the total NAD+ (or NADH) levels, in the nuclear compartment. The measured free cellular NAD+/NADH ratios and total NAD+ (or NADH) levels, therefore, might partially reflect the nuclear ratios and levels. Nmnat-1-depleted cells might have more reduced free NAD+/NADH ratios in the nuclei than the measured cellular ratios (Fig. 4G), which might be comparable to the nuclear ratios in Nampt-depleted cells. Indeed, although reduction of the free cellular NAD+/NADH ratios was less prominent in the Nmnat-1-depleted cells than in Nampt-depleted cells (Fig. 4GversusFig. 4C), the H2B expression defects in the former were similar with, or even slightly greater than, the defects in the latter (Fig. 4F, top panel versusFig. 4B, top panel; real-time PCR quantifications). Results in Fig. 4, taken together, link an optimal H2B expression program in living cells to a proper cellular (nuclear) NAD+ level or a proper free cellular (nuclear) NAD+/NADH ratio. Reducing the NAD+/NADH Ratio in Vivo Down-regulates H2B Expression—The free cellular NAD+/NADH ratios define the redox status, while the overall cellular NAD+ plus NADH level can be constant. We sought to establish an assay system with reduced free cellular NAD+/NADH ratios, but an overall constant NAD+ plus NADH level, and realized that cells treated with NaN3 or CoCl2 met the criterion (Ref. 24.Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, also see below). HeLa cells treated by NaN3 showed a reduced free cellular NAD+/NADH ratio (Fig. 5A) and reduced H2B expression (Fig. 5B). Similar phenotypes were observed in cells treated by CoCl2 (Fig. 5, D and E). The histone expression is tightly coupled with S-phase progression (7.Nelson D.M. Ye X. Hall C. Santos H. Ma T. Kao G.D. Yen T.J. Harper J.W. Adams P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7459-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, there could be a possibility that NaN3 and CoCl2 might adversely affect S-phase progression, which then fed back to H2B expression; however, the treatment by NaN3 or CoCl2 inhibited the H2B expression (Fig. 5, B and E) but did not grossly change cell cycle profiles (Fig. 5G). This implies that the observed H2B expression defects (Fig. 5, B and E) were most likely primary defects due to the redox changes, but not secondary defects caused by a potentially defective S-phase progression. This is in line with primary or direct redox effects in vitro (Fig. 2). In vitro, p38/GAPDH nucleates an Oct-1-OCA-S interaction subject to redox-modulation to determine the H2B transcriptional outputs, in close correlation with the H2B promoter occupancy by p38/GAPDH (Figs. 1 and 2). Such an interaction in living cells should be reflected by H2B promoter occupancy by p38/GAPDH. Indeed, ChIP assays revealed that in the NaN3- or CoCl2-treated cells, H2B promoter occupancy by p38/GAPDH (OCA-S) was reduced (Fig. 5, C and F). This parallels the H2B expression defects in the NaN3- or CoCl2-treated cells (Fig. 5, B and E), which are (primarily) at the transcription level (see below). The NAD+/NADH redox status reflects cellular metabolic states, hence raising a concern of whether the H2B expression defects, as a result of NaN3 and CoCl2 treatments or of disrupting NAD+ biosynthesis, were due to a severe shortage of ATP (an RNA building block) because of the changed NAD+/NADH ratios. We feel that this is highly unlikely for several reasons. First, the β-actin expression (internal control) was unaffected by the changed redox status (Figs. 4, B and F and 5, B and E). Second, the overall ATP levels in control or redox-perturbed cells did not differ significantly. For example, NaN3 treatment led to an only slight decrease of ATP levels at ∼16 h (Fig. 6A); however, H2B expression defects were already manifested with in 2 h of the treatment by NaN3 (Fig. 5B) or even in a shorter period of time (see below, Fig. 6D). NaN3 and CoCl2 perturb the redox status with reduced free cellular NAD+/NADH ratios but sustain a constant NAD+ plus NADH level (24.Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). To reaffirm this, we measured redox-related levels in the redox-perturbed cells; Fig. 6B offers an example with the NaN3 treatment (1 mm) in a 20-h time course. Obviously, the total (NAD+ plus NADH) levels did not significantly change over the 20-h time course, and the total NAD+/NADH ratios (calculated from the total NAD+ and NADH pools) were not significantly reduced at 2 or 4 h. However, the free cellular NAD+/NADH ratio was reduced by ∼50% in 2 h of NaN3 treatment (Fig. 5A) with reduced H2B expression (Fig. 5B) and reduced H2B promoter occupancy by OCA-S (p38/GAPDH; Fig. 5C). The reduced free cellular NAD+/NADH ratios were also a common feature upon blocking the NAD+ biosynthesis, which also led to H2B expression defects (Fig. 4). Thus, the H2B expression in vivo is linked to a proper NAD+/NADH ratio, which defines a proper redox status; perturbing this status inhibits H2B expression (Fig. 5, B and E) by disrupting Oct-1-p38/GAPDH interaction (Fig. 5, C and F). To provide the support that H2B expression defects in redox-perturbed cells are (primarily) at a transcriptional level, we transfected an H2B promoter-luciferase reporter into HeLa cells and found the expression of the ectopic gene to be much reduced in NaN3-treated cells (Fig. 6C). All above in vivo results are in line with the patterns of H2B transcription and the H2B promoter occupancy by p38/GAPDH (OCA-S) in vitro (Figs. 1 and 2). Primary (or Direct) Redox Effects on H2B Transcription—It was shown that NAD(H) directly exerted redox effects on H2B transcription in vitro (Fig. 2). H2B expression defects (Fig. 5, B and E) in vivo upon NaN3 or CoCl2 treatment manifested without a change in cell cycle profiles (Fig. 5G). This is in agreement with a primary effect and argues against an indirect cell cycle effect. To further support that the redox effects on H2B transcription in vivo were primary, we studied the onset of H2B expression defects caused by NaN3 treatment and found the defects to manifest very swiftly (in 30 min of the NaN3 treatment, Fig. 6D). In parallel with this swift onset, reversing redox perturbations by withdrawing NaN3 allowed swift H2B expression recovery (Fig. 6E). If the effects of redox perturbations on H2B transcription are not primary but secondary to the redox changes (e.g. through the cell cycle or other physiological changes), the above onset or recovery might not be as swift as so observed. The above results support primary (or direct) NAD(H) effects on H2B transcription in vitro and in vivo, and all the results (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) support the notion that redox changes are directly sensed by p38/GAPDH to impact upon an Oct-1-OCA-S (p38/GAPDH) interaction to determine the H2B transcriptional output (see “Discussion”). p38/GAPDH, essential for in vivo H2B transcription (10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), represents the enzymes with the coenzyme-modulated gene-switching functions (10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 11.McKnight S.L. Cell. 2003; 114: 150-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12.Shi Y. Shi Y.

Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) and acts as a redox sensor (Fig. 2, B and C) to regulate an Oct-1-OCA-S interaction. This interaction is a key regulatory step determining the H2B transcriptional output. p36/LDH is essential for tethering an intact OCA-S complex to the H2B promoter in vitro, explaining the essential role for H2B expression in vivo (Fig. 3, A–C). The sum of the molecular masses of the OCA-S components approximates the native size (∼300 kDa) of the OCA-S complex (10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This is consistent with monomer presence. Generally, monomeric dehydrogenases, while retaining full NAD(H) binding capacities, lack catalytic abilities (26.Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar); however, p36/LDH within OCA-S seems to be an exception (Fig. 3E) that circumvented the NADH-inhibited H2B transcription in vitro (Fig. 3F). A similar redox modulator role might operate as part of an essential role for H2B expression in living cells (Fig. 3A) to circumvent physiological redox constraints. Coexisting p38/GAPDH and p36/LDH in OCA-S might represent an advantage in which the NAD+/NADH redox status plays multiple roles. For instance, in addition to an Oct-1-p38/GAPDH interaction, a proper NAD+/NADH redox status might play a role in the assembly of the OCA-S complex by allowing p38/GAPDH or p36/LDH to assume proper conformation(s). Future structural studies may provide clues regarding this notion. The redox-modulated H2B expression is most likely a direct (or primary) response of H2B transcription to varied NAD+/ NADH redox status. First, in vitro, the H2B transcription and Oct-1-OCA-S interaction were redox-modulated (Figs. 1 A–F, 2, B–C, and 3B) in which the exogenous NAD(H) were not converted to other metabolites or interconverted (Fig. 2D), which otherwise might exert indirect effects. Second, the H2B promoter and Oct-1/OCA-S specificity (Figs. 1, A–E and 2C) argue against a nonspecific redox effect. Third, in vivo upon redox-perturbations, H2B expression defects (Fig. 5, B and E) manifested without changing the cell cycle profiles (Fig. 5G). Fourth, the onset of H2B expression defects upon redox perturbations was very swift, and H2B expression recovered swiftly upon withdrawing of the redox perturbations (Fig. 6, D and E). Taken together, these results are in accord with the primary (or direct) NAD(H) redox effects on H2B transcription in vitro and in vivo, and with the notion that the redox target is the Oct-1-OCA-S interaction that determines H2B transcriptional output. The biphasic responses (Fig. 1, A, C–E, and G), and that H2B transcription was sensitive to the NAD+ depletion (Fig. 4), suggest that the H2B transcription favors higher NAD+ levels or higher NAD+/NADH ratios within a certain range that defines a proper redox status. DNA damage/repair generally consumes the nuclear NAD+ pool (27.Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), which may render the H2B expression sensitive to NAD+ depletion in a similar fashion as scenarios in Fig. 4. This and a coordination mechanism (10.Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) may contribute to a global histone expression inhibition upon DNA damage, in addition to the activated cell cycle checkpoint (e.g. Ref. 28.Su C. Gao G. Schneider S. Helt C. Weiss C. O'Reilly M.A. Bohmann D. Zhao J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In view of the in vitro biphasic responses (see Fig. 1, A and C–E), physiological or pathological redox perturbations that can potentially elevate the NAD+/NADH ratios in vivo, if beyond certain threshold, are expected to inhibit H2B expression. This is in line with the H2B transcription requiring a proper cellular redox status (redox balance). Direct links between gene switching and the metabolic state of a cell are quite common in prokaryotes but rarely reported in eukaryotes (12.Shi Y. Shi Y. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The current study shows that the activity of p38/GAPDH as an OCA-S component in histone transcription, and potentially other aspects of the OCA-S function, can be modulated by the redox status. Given that the cellular redox status reflects the cellular metabolic state, our study suggests a direct link between cellular metabolism and gene switching in higher eukaryotes. Because S-phase events are tightly coupled to ensure an orderly S-phase progression (1.Ma T. van Tine B.A. Wei Y. Garrett M.D. Nelson D. Adams P.D. Wang J. Qin J. Chow L.T. Harper J.W.

https://openalex.org/W2022260308,"A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes mediated by β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-ARs). However, the detailed mechanism of β2-ARs-induced p38 MAPK activation has not yet been fully defined. The present study demonstrates a novel kinetic model of p38 MAPK activation induced by β2-ARs in human embryonic kidney 293A cells. The β2-AR agonist isoproterenol induced a time-dependent biphasic phosphorylation of p38 MAPK: the early phase peaked at 10 min, and was followed by a delayed phase that appeared at 90 min and was sustained for 6 h. Interestingly, inhibition of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway failed to affect the early phosphorylation but abolished the delayed activation. By contrast, silencing of β-arrestin-1 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited the early phase activation of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, the NADPH oxidase complex is a downstream target of β-arrestin-1, as evidenced by the fact that isoproterenol-induced Rac1 activation was also suppressed by β-arrestin-1 knockdown. In addition, early phase activation of p38 MAPK was prevented by inactivation of Rac1 and NADPH oxidase by pharmacological inhibitors, overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, and p47phox knockdown by RNA interference. Of note, we demonstrated that only early activation of p38 MAPK is involved in isoproterenol-induced F-actin rearrangement. Collectively, these data suggest that the classic cAMP/PKA pathway is responsible for the delayed activation, whereas a β-arrestin-1/Rac1/NADPH oxidase-dependent signaling is a heretofore unrecognized mechanism for β2-AR-mediated early activation of p38 MAPK.

For example, in β2-ARs-overexpressing transgenic mice with cardiomyopathy, cardiac-specific expression of dominant-negative p38α MAPK improved cardiac function and reduces cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis (5Peter P.S.

Generally, β2-ARs are believed to exert their effects through a classic Gs/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Upon β2-ARs stimulation, cAMP/PKA-dependent p38 MAPK activation has been shown in various cells, including macrophages, PC12, MC3T3-E1 cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, NIH 3T3 cells, adipocytes, and rat cardiac myocytes (6Yamauchi J.

In addition, β2-ARs, also via coupling to Gi, induce activation of p38 MAPK, and subsequently attenuate β-AR-stimulated apoptosis in adult rat cardiac myocytes (9Zheng M. Zhu W. Han Q. Xiao R.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 108: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, emerging evidence suggests that in some settings, the classical cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway does not fully account for β2-AR-mediated p38 MAPK activation. The cAMP/PKA-independent activation of p38 MAPK has been shown to regulate the expressions of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2 in colon cancer cells (10Nishihara H. Hwang M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 26176-26183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and pituitary hormone prolactin in human T lymphocytes (11Gerlo S. Verdood P. Hooghe-Peters E. Kooijman R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In Raw264.7 cells, inductions of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 by stimulation of β2-ARs occur mainly though the Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac), B-Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), and the p38 MAPK pathway (12Tan K.S. Nackley A.G. Satterfield K. Maixner W. Diatchenko L. Flood P.M. Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we also recently demonstrated that in mouse cardiac fibroblasts, both classic cAMP/PKA and Epac/Rap1 routes are not required for p38 MAPK-mediated secretion of interleukin-6 in response to β2-ARs stimulation (13Yin F. Wang Y.Y. Du J.H. Li C. Lu Z.Z. Han C. Zhang Y.Y. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2006; 40: 384-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that β2-AR-activate p38 MAPK in numerous cells and tissues, a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanism remains unknown. This is necessary before the potential benefits of exploiting p38 MAPK as a target of β2-AR agonists can be extrapolated into the therapeutic arena. The mammalian arrestin family consists of four members: arrestin-1 and -4, and β-arrestin-1 and -2. Of these, β-arrestin-1 and -2 are ubiquitously expressed (14Lefkowitz R.J. Rajagopal K. Whalen E.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition to their well established role in terminating GPCR signal transduction, accumulating evidence indicates that they can modulate compartmentalization of intracellular cAMP signaling and initiate various cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling cascades (15Ahn S.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For example, binding of β-arrestin-1/2 to components of the ERK1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 cascades allows them to function as scaffolding molecules, thus localizing these kinases activation (17Tohgo A. Choy E.W. Gesty-Palmer D. Pierce K.L. Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6258-6267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Importantly, β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation is implicated in the regulation of chemotaxis and cell survival by altering the profile of gene transcription, in a manner distinct from the classic G-protein-dependent pathway (14Lefkowitz R.J. Rajagopal K. Whalen E.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 18Wisler J.W. DeWire S.M. Whalen E.J. Violin J.D. Drake M.T. Ahn S.

In the present study we investigate whether β-arrestins are involved in β2-AR-mediated p38 MAPK activation. We show that β2-ARs stimulation induces a biphasic activation (early and delayed) of p38 MAPK, which is distinct from a previously described monophasic model in mast cells (1Chi D. Fitzgerald S.M. Pitts S. Cantor K. King E. Lee S. Huang S.K. Krishnaswamy G. BMC Immunol. 2004; 5: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), fat cells, embryonic chick ventricular cells (4Magne S. Couchie D. Pecker F. Pavoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39539-39548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and adult rat cardiac myocytes (8Zheng M. Zhang S.J. Zhu W.Z. Ziman B. Kobilka B.K. Xiao R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40635-40640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, early phase activation of p38 MAPK can be prevented by reducing the expression of β-arrestin-1 by siRNA and inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity. By contrast, the classic cAMP/PKA pathway is involved in the delayed activation of p38 MAPK following exposure to isoproterenol. Antibodies, Reagents, and Plasmids—Antibodies used included phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), phospho-p42/44 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), phospho-HSP27 (Ser82), p47phox and p38β MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), p38 MAPK (C-20), GAPDH (6C5), β-arrestin-1 (K-16), β-arrestin-2 (H-9), β2-AR (H-73), G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2, C-15), GRK3 (H-43), GRK5 (H-64), and GRK6 (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence reagents were from Pierce. TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were from Beijing Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology (Beijing, China). Isoproterenol, ICI 118551, propranolol, (Rp)-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyl cyclic AMP (8-pCPT-2Me-cAMP), H89, KT5720, SQ22536, isobutylmethylxanthine, and SB202190 were from Sigma. Clostridium difficile Toxin B (Toxin B), NSC23766, Y27632, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), apocynin, and rotenone were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). 5-(and 6)-Chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin were from Invitrogen. Plasmids encoding dominant-negative human β-arrestin-2 and dynamin-1 (K44A) were a gift from Dr. Ming Zhao (La Jolla Institute for Molecular Medicine, San Diego, CA) (19Zhao M. Wimmer A. Trieu K. DiScipio R.G. Schraufstatter I.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49259-49267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative plasmid of human p38α MAPK was a gift from Dr. Haian Fu (Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine). A plasmid encoding human β2-AR with a FLAG tag was a gift from Dr. Kenneth P. Minneman (Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine). Several dominant negative expression plasmids cloned into pcDNA3.1, including Rac1 T17N 3×HA, RhoA T19N 3× HA, and Cdc42 T17N 3× HA were purchased from Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293A cells were grown in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Intracellular cAMP Assay—Intercellular cAMP levels were determined as previously described (20Malki S. Nef S. Notarnicola C. Thevenet L. Gasca S. Méjean C. Berta P. Poulat F. Boizet-Bonhoure B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1798-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), using a commercial Parameter™ Cyclic AMP immunoassay kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). In brief, prior to stimulation with isoproterenol, cells were preincubated with 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 20 min, and then lysed in 100 μl of the lysis buffer kit and freeze/thawed three times. The suspension was then centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration of the supernatant measured using a BCA assay (Pierce). cAMP levels in the supernatant were immediately determined according to the manufacturer's protocol. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variance were 12.4 and 9.7%, respectively. PKA Activities Assay—PKA activity was determined using a non-radioactive PKA kinase activity assay kit (Assay Designs, MI). The assay utilizes a specific synthetic peptide as a substrate for PKA, which is readily phosphorylated by PKA. Cells seeded onto 60-mm dishes were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm MOPS, 50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin), and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was stored at –70 °C until required. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the samples are added to the appropriate duplicated wells, followed by the addition of ATP to initiate the reaction. The kinase reaction is terminated and a specific phosphor-substrate antibody added to the wells. Following the addition of a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, color development was initiated by the addition of a tetramethylbenzidine substrate. The color development was stopped with an acid stop solution and the intensity of the color measured in a microplate reader at 450 nm; color development being proportional to PKA phosphotransferase activity. The results are expressed as relative kinase activity (OD/mg·protein). The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variance were 5.4 and 4.7%, respectively. RNA Interference—Chemically synthesized, double-stranded siRNAs, with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′-deoxyterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase overhangs were from Shanghai GeneChem (Shanghai, China). The siRNA sequences targeting human β-arrestin-1 and -2 were 5′-AGCCUUCUGCGCGGAGAAUtt-3′ and 5′-GGACCGCAAAGUGUUUGUGtt-3′, respectively. The previously validated siRNA sequences targeting GRKs included: GRK2 (5′-AAGAAGUACGAGAAGCUGGAG-3′), GRK3 (5′-AAGCAAGCUGUAGAACACGUA-3′), GKR5 (5′-AAGCCGUGCAAAGAACUCUUU-3′), and GRK6 (5′-AACAGUAGGUUUGUAGUGAGC-3′) (21Violin J.D. Ren X.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20577-20588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The previously confirmed siRNA sequences targeting p38α and p38β are 5′-AAGAAGCTCTCCAGACCATTT-3′ and 5′-AACTGGATGCATTACAACCAA-3′, respectively (22Shiromizu T. Goto H. Tomono Y. Bartek J. Totsukawa G. Inoko A. Nakanishi M. Matsumura F. Inagaki M. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). siRNA for human GAPDH was used as a positive control (5′-GUGGAUAUUGUUGCCAUCAtt-3′). A non-silencing scramble RNA duplex was used as a negative control (5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt-3′). Additionally, to knock down the expression of human p47phox in a complementary experiment, p47phox siRNA duplex (sc-29422) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For siRNA experiments, early passage HEK293A cells at 40–50% confluence on 35-mm plates were transfected with siRNA by use of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 to 72 h of transfection, cells were treated with isoproterenol for the appropriate times and harvested. The inhibitory efficiency of these siRNA probes was assessed by measuring knockdown of their respective proteins by Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Protein expression was analyzed by Western blot as previously described (23Yin F. Li P. Zheng M. Chen L. Xu Q. Chen K. Wang Y. Zhang Y. Han C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21070-21075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, blots were probed with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at room temperature, then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Bands were visualized by use of a super-Western sensitivity chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Autoradiographs were quantitated by densitometry (Science Imaging System, Bio-Rad). Analysis of in Vitro p38 MAPK Kinase Activity—p38 MAPK kinase activity was determined using a non-radioactive p38 kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Briefly, cells were lysed in the kit lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates (600 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with an immobilized phosphor-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) monoclonal antibody, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 s. The immunocomplexes were washed (2 times with lysis buffer and 3 times with the kit kinase buffer), centrifuged, and suspended in 50 μl of the kinase buffer. Following addition of ATP (200 μm) and the phosphor-p38 MAPK substrate (ATF-2 fusion protein, 1 μg), samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction terminated by addition of 25 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. Samples were then boiled, centrifuged, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated ATF-2 was detected by immunoblotting with a phospho-ATF-2 (Thr76) antibody. Rap1 and Rac1 Activity Pulldown Assay—As previously reported (13Yin F. Wang Y.Y. Du J.H. Li C. Lu Z.Z. Han C. Zhang Y.Y. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2006; 40: 384-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), Rap1 activation was determined using a commercially available kit (Millipore-Upstate). Rac1 activation was measured using a Stressgen StressXpress® Rac1 activation kit (Assay Designs, MI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, following cell lysis, 600 μg of total protein was incubated with 20 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Pak-PBD in the spin cup containing an immobilized glutathione disc for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Bound proteins were washed, mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged at 7200 × g for 2 min. Pulled down active or GTP-Rac1 was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a Rac1 monoclonal antibody. Flow Cytometric Analysis of ROS—Serum-starved cells were loaded with 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed gently with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in the presence of isoproterenol. CM-H2DCFDA is a cell permeant indicator for ROS, which is non-fluorescent until oxidization by intracellular oxidation. Treated cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then detached by trypsinization and pelleted by centrifugation (800 × g for 5 min) at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.6 ml of ice-cold PBS and cellular fluorescence intensity immediately measured using a flow cytometer (BD FACS Calibur, CA) equipped with a laser lamp (emission 480 nm; band pass filter 530 nm). Data were normalized to values obtained from mock-treated controls. Approximately 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample. Fluorescence Microscopy—To assess F-actin rearrangement induced by isoproterenol, cells grown on glass coverslips were cultured without serum for 6 h. Following exposure to the appropriate inhibitors and isoproterenol, cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized with 4% formaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100. Following washing with PBS, F-actin was stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1.0 μg/ml) for 45 min at room temperature, washed, mounted on slides with 90% glycerol in PBS, and visualized by fluorescence microscopy (×200). To provide a valid comparison, identical acquisition parameters were used for all observations. Images were randomly acquired from 10 different fields per dish or coverslip. Confocal Imaging—To monitor intracellular distribution of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, cells were seeded on glass coverslips. The serum-starved treated cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized as above. Following washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight, and a TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100) for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (50 ng/ml) in PBS for 15 min. Coverslips were washed, mounted with 90% glycerol, and viewed on a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP2; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with a ×40 oil immersion objective lens. Statistics—Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance or Student's t test was used for statistical analysis as appropriate. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Biphasic Activation of p38 MAPK in Response to Isoproterenol Stimulation—To elucidate the mechanism of p38 MAPK activation by β2-ARs, HEK293A cells were incubated with 1 μm isoproterenol (β-adrenergic receptor agonist) for 2.5 min to 24 h. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK was determined by Western blot analysis with a specific antibody against p38 MAPK phosphorylated at residues Thr180/Tyr182. Isoproterenol caused a rapid increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which was detected as early as 2.5 min and peaked at 10 min (i.e. early activation) before returning to basal level by 60 min. Surprisingly, isoproterenol also caused a secondary increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK after 90 min (i.e. delayed activation), which lasted for at least 6 h (Fig. 1A). Stripping and reprobing the blots with antibody against p38 MAPK demonstrated that equal amounts of p38 MAPK were detectable before and after isoproterenol treatment. In vitro kinase analysis indicated that the kinetics of p38 MAPK activity paralleled changes in its phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). In addition, intracellular immunofluorescence staining with specific phosphor-p38 MAPK antibodies and confocal imaging also illustrated the biphasic activation of p38 MAPK. Interestingly, during the early phase of the response, activated p38 MAPK was localized to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, whereas during the delayed phase it was uniformly distributed within the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1C). The difference in distribution of activated p38 MAPK at distinct phases suggests the existence of different physiological end points. Furthermore, isoproterenol dose dependently increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK during both phases of the response, with EC50 of 1.094 and 4.405 nm for early and delayed activation, respectively (supplemental data Fig. S1, A and B). Previous studies indicate that β2- but not β1-ARs are endogenously expressed in HEK293 cells. As expected, cells pretreated for 30 min with either propranolol, a non-selective β-AR antagonist, or ICI 118551, a selective β2-AR antagonist, reduced both early and delayed p38 MAPK activation (supplemental data Fig. S2). Therefore, the stimulation of endogenous β2-ARs is sufficient to evoke biphasic activation of p38 MAPK in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. It is noted that the similar pattern of p38 MAPK phosphorylation was also obtained in cells with transient overexpression of β2-ARs (data not shown). Compared with those mock-transfected cells, isoproterenol stimulation readily evoked the biphasic phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, as evidenced by the overall p38 MAPK phosphorylation that was increased by 2.5-fold at 10 min and 3.2-fold at 90 min (supplemental data Fig. S3, A and B). Both p38α and p38β Are Implicated in the Biphasic Activation of p38 MAPK by β2-ARs—The mammalian p38 MAPK subfamily includes four known isoforms: p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ. p38α and p38β are ubiquitously expressed, whereas p38γ and p38δ appear to have more restricted tissue-specific expression (2Ashwell J.D.

To elucidate which p38 isoform(s) is involved in the biphasic activation of p38 MAPK in response to isoproterenol, we focused on p38α and p38β MAPK. In cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant of p38α MAPK, both the early and delayed activation of p38 MAPK by isoproterenol was partially attenuated (supplemental data Fig. S4). In addition, in cells transfected with siRNA directed toward p38α, p38β MAPK, or scramble control there was selective knockdown of their endogenously expressed target protein compared with scramble control (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, silencing either p38α or p38β MAPK inhibited the early and delayed activation of MAPK (Fig. 2, B and C). Collectively, these results suggest that p38α and p38β MAPK are both implicated in the biphasic activation of p38 MAPK following stimulation with isoproterenol in HEK293 cells. Effects of the cAMP/PKA Signaling Pathway in the Biphasic Activation of p38 MAPK—β2-ARs classically couple to Gs proteins to initiate signaling via a cAMP/PKA pathway. To determine the involvement of the cAMP/PKA pathway in the biphasic activation of p38 MAPK by β2-ARs, cells were pretreated with a potent adenyl cyclase inhibitor. To our surprise, even though 100 μm SQ22536 inhibited the isoproterenol-induced increase in cAMP as determined by a competitive nonradioactive enzyme-linked assay (supplemental data Fig. S5), it did not affect the early activation of p38 MAPK. However, it did inhibit phosphorylation of p38 MAPK during the delayed phase (Fig. 3A). PKA is the primary downstream target for cAMP. As in previous studies (12Tan K.S. Nackley A.G. Satterfield K.

Interestingly, in cells preincubated for 30 min with 10 μm (Rp)-cAMP, the early activation of p38 MAPK was unaffected. However, delayed activation of p38 MAPK was completely abolished (Fig. 3B). Similar results were also obtained from cells pretreated with H89 or KT5720 (Fig. 3, C and D). Together, these results indicate that the Gs/cAMP/PKA pathway is only responsible for the delayed activation of p38 MAPK by β2-ARs. cAMP/Epac Signaling Is Not Involved in Isoproterenol-induced p38 MAPK Activation—In addition to PKA, cAMP can also active the Epac/Rap1 pathway and has been implicated in β2-AR-induced activation of several effectors including protein kinase Cϵ in dorsal root ganglion neurons (25Hucho T.B. Dina O.A. Levine J.D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6119-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells (26Keiper M. Stope M.B. Szatkowski D. Bohm A. Tysack K. vom Dorp F.

Activation of Epac by specific cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2Me-cAMP (8-pCPT) can activate p38 MAPK in cultured cerebellar granule cells (27Ster J. De, Bock F. Guérineau N.C. Janossy A. Barrère-Lemaire S.

In this study, 8-pCPT, as a direct activator of Epac, and ISO activated Rap1 as determined using pulldown assays (Fig. 4A), 8-pCPT did not elicit p38 MAPK phosphorylation during the first 90 min of exposure (Fig. 4B). Therefore, these results suggest that β2-AR-mediated biphasic activation of p38 MAPK involves different signaling mechanisms. The classical cAMP/PKA pat"
https://openalex.org/W2045335734,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, alpha-isopropylmalate (alpha-IPM), which is produced in mitochondria, must be exported to the cytosol where it is required for leucine biosynthesis. Recombinant and reconstituted mitochondrial oxalacetate carrier (Oac1p) efficiently transported alpha-IPM in addition to its known substrates oxalacetate, sulfate, and malonate and in contrast to other di- and tricarboxylate transporters as well as the previously proposed alpha-IPM transporter. Transport was saturable with a half-saturation constant of 75 +/- 4 microm for alpha-IPM and 0.31 +/- 0.04 mm for beta-IPM and was inhibited by the substrates of Oac1p. Though not transported, alpha-ketoisocaproate, the immediate precursor of leucine in the biosynthetic pathway, inhibited Oac1p activity competitively. In contrast, leucine, alpha-ketoisovalerate, valine, and isoleucine neither inhibited nor were transported by Oac1p. Consistent with the function of Oac1p as an alpha-IPM transporter, cells lacking the gene for this carrier required leucine for optimal growth on fermentable carbon sources. Single deletions of other mitochondrial carrier genes or of LEU4, which is the only other enzyme that can provide the cytosol with alpha-IPM (in addition to Oac1p) exhibited no growth defect, whereas the double mutant DeltaOAC1DeltaLEU4 did not grow at all on fermentable substrates in the absence of leucine. The lack of growth of DeltaOAC1DeltaLEU4 cells was partially restored by adding the leucine biosynthetic cytosolic intermediates alpha-ketoisocaproate and alpha-IPM to these cells as well as by complementing them with one of the two unknown human mitochondrial carriers SLC25A34 and SLC25A35. Oac1p is important for leucine biosynthesis on fermentable carbon sources catalyzing the export of alpha-IPM, probably in exchange for oxalacetate."
https://openalex.org/W2071071778,"In previous studies, we determined that β1 integrins from human colon tumors have elevated levels of α2-6 sialylation, a modification added by β-galactosamide α-2,6-sialyltranferase I (ST6Gal-I). Intriguingly, the β1 integrin is thought to be a ligand for galectin-3 (gal-3), a tumor-associated lectin. The effects of gal-3 are complex; intracellular forms typically protect cells against apoptosis through carbohydrate-independent mechanisms, whereas secreted forms bind to cell surface oligosaccharides and induce apoptosis. In the current study, we tested whether α2-6 sialylation of the β1 integrin modulates binding to extracellular gal-3. Herein we report that SW48 colonocytes lacking α2-6 sialylation exhibit β1 integrin-dependent binding to gal-3-coated tissue culture plates; however, binding is attenuated upon forced expression of ST6Gal-I. Removal of α2-6 sialic acids from ST6Gal-I expressors by neuraminidase treatment restores gal-3 binding. Additionally, using a blot overlay approach, we determined that gal-3 binds directly and preferentially to unsialylated, as compared with α2-6-sialylated, β1 integrins. To understand the physiologic consequences of gal-3 binding, cells were treated with gal-3 and monitored for apoptosis. Galectin-3 was found to induce apoptosis in parental SW48 colonocytes (unsialylated), whereas ST6Gal-I expressors were protected. Importantly, gal-3-induced apoptosis was inhibited by function blocking antibodies against the β1 subunit, suggesting that β1 integrins are critical transducers of gal-3-mediated effects on cell survival. Collectively, our results suggest that the coordinate up-regulation of gal-3 and ST6Gal-I, a feature that is characteristic of colon carcinoma, may confer tumor cells with a selective advantage by providing a mechanism for blockade of the pro-apoptotic effects of secreted gal-3.

Aberrant cell surface carbohydrates are highly associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. In particular, N-linked glycans on tumor cells tend to be more highly branched, with greater levels of terminal sialylation (1Hakomori S.

Previously, our group identified the β1 integrin subunit as a target for oncogenic Ras-induced ST6Gal-I activity (11Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Singhal A. Bellis S.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7137-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and further determined that α2-6 sialylation of β1 integrins stimulated cell attachment and migration on collagen I (12Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Brunson B.A. Wakefield J.K. Frost A.R. Bellis S.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We also reported that β1 integrins in colon tumor tissues carry elevated levels of α2-6-linked sialic acid (12Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Brunson B.A. Wakefield J.K. Frost A.R. Bellis S.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that hypersialylation of the β1 integrin may contribute to the invasive tumor cell phenotype by modulating cell-matrix interactions. β-galactosamide α-2,6-sialyltranferase I alkaline phosphatase galectin parental empty vector bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate polyvinylidene difluoride. β-galactosamide α-2,6-sialyltranferase I alkaline phosphatase galectin parental empty vector bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate polyvinylidene difluoride. There is a vast literature directed at understanding integrin association with traditional extracellular matrix ligands such as collagen, fibronectin, etc. However, accumulating data suggest that integrins also bind to galectins, a family of lectins that can associate with the matrix through interactions with laminin and fibronectin (13Elola M.T. Wolfenstein-Todel C. Troncoso M.F. Vasta G.R. Rabinovich G.A. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1679-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 14Ochieng J. Furtak V. Lukyanov P. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Galectins are β-galactoside-binding proteins that bind to target molecules through conserved carbohydrate recognition domains. So far, at least 15 mammalian galectins have been identified, and these are known to regulate numerous biological processes including cell adhesion/migration, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immune responses (13Elola M.T. Wolfenstein-Todel C. Troncoso M.F. Vasta G.R. Rabinovich G.A. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1679-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 15Liu F.T. Rabinovich G.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). One unique member of the galectin family is galectin-3 (gal-3), which has only one carbohydrate recognition domain, in combination with an extended N-terminal domain that is thought to promote oligomerization (16Dumic J. Dabelic S. Flogel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 616-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 is expressed intracellularly but can also be secreted through a nonclassical pathway (17Hughes R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Intracellular gal-3 generally mediates anti-apoptotic effects through carbohydrate-independent processes, whereas extracellular gal-3 binds to cell surface oligosaccharides and thereby induces apoptosis and also modulates cell-matrix interactions (15Liu F.T. Rabinovich G.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 16Dumic J. Dabelic S. Flogel M. Biochim. Biophys.

Given the diverse locales and functions of gal-3, the ultimate effect of this lectin on tumor cell behavior, and particularly survival, likely depends upon the balance of signals arising from intracellular versus extracellular gal-3. Like ST6Gal-I, gal-3 appears to play important roles in neoplastic cell metastasis. Transfection of gal-3 into low metastatic colon cancer cells enabled the cells to become more metastatic after inoculation into spleen or cecum of nude mice. In contrast, transfection of antisense gal-3 into a highly metastatic colon cancer cell line reduced metastatic capability (19Bresalier R.S. Mazurek N. Sternberg L.R. Byrd J.C. Yunker C.K. Nangia-Makker P. Raz A. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 is reported to be highly expressed in several tumor types including colon carcinoma, and up-regulated gal-3 expression is associated with tumor aggressiveness (15Liu F.T. Rabinovich G.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 16Dumic J. Dabelic S. Flogel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 616-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that galectin binding to β-galactosides may be sensitive to terminal sialylation. For example, Hirabayashi's group (20Hirabayashi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W.E. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) used frontal affinity chromatography to show that the binding of gal-3 to synthetic oligosaccharides (as opposed to cellular glycoproteins) could occur in the presence of α2-3, but not α2-6, sialylation of β-galactose. Studies of immune cells support this general concept; cell surface α2-6 sialylation was reported to block apoptosis induced by galectin-1 (gal-1) (21Amano M. Galvan M. He J. Baum L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7469-7475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 22Suzuki O. Nozawa Y. Abe M. Int. J. Oncol. 2006; 28: 155-160PubMed Google Scholar). However, the potential roles of gal-3 and ST6Gal-I in regulating epithelial cell survival have received little attention despite the fact that both gal-3 and ST6Gal-I are implicated in tumor progression. Accordingly, we compared the effects of gal-3 on SW48 cells that either lack endogenous ST6Gal-I (parental cells) or have forced expression of ST6Gal-I. These studies showed that gal-3 preferentially binds to cells with unsialylated β1 integrins. Moreover, α2-6 sialylation of the β1 integrin was found to protect cells against gal-3-mediated cell apoptosis, implicating a role for ST6Gal-I in regulating tumor cell survival. Cell Lines—The human SW48 colon epithelial cell line was purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). These cells are derived from a stage IV colon adenocarcinoma, and subcutaneous inoculation of SW48 cells into nude mice reportedly results in tumor formation 100% of the time (23Hay R. Caputo J. Chen T.R. Macy M. McClintock P. Reid Y. ATCC Cell Lines and Hybridomas. 8th Ed. ATCC, Rockville, MD1994Google Scholar). SW48 cells have no detectable α2-6 or α2-3 sialyltransferase activity (24Dall'Olio F. Chiricolo M. Lollini P. Lau J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SW48 cells stably expressing either empty vector (EV) or ST6Gal-I (ST6) were established as described previously using a lentiviral vector (12Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Brunson B.A. Wakefield J.K. Frost A.R. Bellis S.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and pooled populations of lentiviral-infected clones were utilized for all studies. The cells were grown in Leibovitz's L-15 medium with 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyglone, Logan, UT). EV and ST6 cells were maintained with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) in complete culture medium (the puromycin was removed from the medium at least 1 day in advance of all experiments). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a CO2-free incubator. Galectin-1/3 Cell Adhesion Assay—InnoCyte ECM adhesion assay gal-1/gal-3 kits were purchased from Calbiochem. According to the vendor, the wells were coated with 100 μl/well of either 5 μg/ml gal-1 or 5 μg/ml gal-3 in PBS followed by blocking with 2% BSA in PBS. BSA- and poly-l-lysine-coated wells were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The wells were never exposed to serum-containing medium during commercial processing. Cells were harvested by cell stripper (Mediatech) and washed extensively in PBS. Then the cells (at subconfluent density) were seeded onto each well in serum-free medium and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The 2-h attachment interval was selected because epithelial cells typically bind maximally to most substrates within 2 h. As well, allowing cells to adhere for longer time points increases the possibility that cells will secrete matrix molecules such as fibronectin or collagen, which could compromise the interpretation of results. After a 2-h incubation, cells were washed with PBS twice and labeled with calcein AM for 1 h at 37°C. The number of calcein AM-labeled cells was measured by VersaFluor fluorometer (Bio-Rad) at 520 nm. For some experiments, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of either lactose (Sigma) or sucrose (Bio-Rad). For the β1 integrin blocking study, 35 μg/ml function blocking antibodies against the β1 integrin (catalog number MAB1965, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) or a mouse IgG1 isotype control (R&D Systems) were preincubated with SW48 cells for 45 min at 37 °C prior to seeding cells onto the galectin-coated plates. All data were analyzed by a Student's paired t test. Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested by cell stripper (Mediatech) and were adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/tube with 100 μl of 0.2% BSA in PBS. 10 μl of FITC-conjugated anti-β1 integrin antibody (Chemicon International), FITC-conjugated mouse IgG1 (Invitrogen), or PBS only were added to each tube and incubated on ice for 60 min. The cells were washed three times with 0.2% BSA in PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of 0.2% BSA in PBS for flow cytometric analysis on FACScan (BD Biosciences). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were incubated with a primary antibody against gal-1 (R&D Systems), gal-3 (R&D Systems), β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), or β1 integrins (BD Biosciences). The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and developed with Immobilon chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Neuraminidase Treatment of Cell Lysates—90 μg of cell lysates were treated in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of neura-minidase from Clostridium perfringens (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 1 h at 37°C. The cell lysates were subsequently boiled in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for the β1 integrin (BD Biosciences). Neuraminidase Treatment of Cells—4 × 105 cells were treated in the presence or absence of 50 units of neuraminidase from C. perfringens (New England Biolabs) in PBS (pH 7.0) for 1 h at 37 °C. Then the cells were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in serum-free culture medium for gal-3 cell adhesion assay. Immunofluorescent Staining—Round German glass coverslips (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA) were coated with 20 μg/ml collagen I (Inamed Biomaterials, Fremont, CA) overnight. The cells were plated on the collagen-coated coverslips for 3 h at 37°C and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min and blocked with 5% donkey serum. The cells were subsequently incubated with anti-gal-3 antibody (R&D Systems), no primary antibody, or mouse IgG2b isotype control (R&D Systems) for 1 h at room temperature followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount medium (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA), and cells were viewed under ×60 oil objective of a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Images were taken by a Nikon CoolSNAP camera. Galectin-3 Overlay—Cell lysates (500 μg of total protein/sample) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a glycosylation-insensitive anti-β1 integrin antibody, MAB 2000 (Chemicon International). Protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were then added, and samples were incubated for 2 additional hours at 4 °C with rotation. The agarose beads were washed with lysis buffer and then boiled in 2× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. Precipitated proteins were resolved by on 7% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were exposed to alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated gal-3 and developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (25de Melo F.H. Butera D. Medeiros R.S. Andrade L.N. Nonogaki S. Soares F.A. Alvarez R.A. Moura da Silva A.M. Chammas R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 55: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Galectin-3-induced Apoptosis—Cells were seeded in 4-well chamber slides (BD Biosciences) or 6-well plates in complete medium for 24 h. The adherent cells (40-60% confluency) were then washed with PBS twice and incubated in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of gal-3 (R&D Systems) or gal-3 plus β-lactose (Sigma) for 24 h. Direct visualization of the cells following the gal-3 incubation did not reveal any significant increases in the number of detached cells, suggesting that the addition of soluble gal-3 had no effect on cell adhesion to tissue culture plastic. After gal-3 treatment, the cells were either fixed for Hoechst 33258 staining or solubilized in protein lysis buffer for cleaved caspase-3 Western blots. The 24-h time point for analyzing apoptotic responses to gal-3 was selected because this is a common time interval for evaluating apoptosis of epithelial cells and has been used previously to study gal-1- and gal-3-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes. We recognize that soluble gal-3 was used in this assay, rather than the immobilized form of gal-3 used for binding assays. We considered examining apoptosis in response to immobilized gal-3 but concluded that such experiments might be difficult to interpret. Specifically, ST6 cells do not adhere well on immobilized gal-3 (as shown in Fig. 1), and extended incubations would likely result in anoikis. Accordingly, it might be difficult to discriminate between anoikis-related apoptosis versus gal-3-induced apoptosis. To evaluate integrin involvement in gal-3-induced apoptosis, cells were allowed to adhere to tissue culture plates for 24 h as before, and then anti-β1 integrin function-blocking antibodies were added to the cells for 45 min followed by the addition of the gal-3-containing medium. Four different antibodies were tested (at 35 μg/ml): two distinct anti-β1 function-blocking antibodies (catalog numbers MAB1965 and MAB2253, Chemicon International) and two distinct IgG1 isotype controls (Chemicon International, catalog number PP100; and R&D Systems, catalog number MAB002). Neither the anti-β1 nor the control antibodies had any apparent effect on cell attachment or morphology (data not shown). Hoechst 33258 Staining—Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. The cells were then washed with PBS and stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount medium (Polysciences Inc.), and the percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated from 10 different randomly selected fields at ×40 objective. Apoptotic nuclei were visualized by nuclear condensation and fragmentation. All data were analyzed by a Student's paired t test. Staurosporine-induced Apoptosis—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates in complete medium for 24 h before treatment. The cells were washed with PBS twice and incubated in 1 μm staurosporine (Cell Signaling Technology) for 4 h. The cells were lysed in protein lysis buffer for cleaved caspase-3 Western blots. α2-6 Sialylation Inhibits the Binding of SW48 Cells to Galectin-3—Parental (Par), EV-transduced, or ST6Gal-I-expressing (ST6) SW48 cells were evaluated for cell adhesion to either gal-1 or gal-3. Briefly, cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h to tissue culture wells precoated with either gal-1 or gal-3. BSA- and poly-l-lysine-coated wells were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1A, none of the cell lines exhibited any specific binding to gal-1; therefore this lectin was not studied further. In contrast, Par and EV cells demonstrated substantial binding to gal-3, whereas the binding of ST6Gal-I-expressing cells was limited. Cell attachment to gal-3 was significantly inhibited by β-lactose but not by an equivalent concentration of sucrose, indicating that gal-3 binds to specific carbohydrate structures (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data suggest that α2-6 sialic acids, added by the ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase, block the binding of gal-3 to cell surface glycan targets. Cell Adhesion to Galectin-3 Is Dependent upon β1 Integrins—The dual findings that β1 integrins can be differentially sialylated (5Bellis S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1663: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Singhal A. Bellis S.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7137-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Brunson B.A. Wakefield J.K. Frost A.R. Bellis S.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and are binding partners for galectins (26Fukumori T. Takenaka Y. Yoshii T. Kim H.R. Hogan V. Inohara H. Kagawa S. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8302-8311PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to test whether gal-3 binding was mediated by the β1 subunit. Of note, Par and ST6 cells express equivalent amounts of cell surface β1 integrins (Fig. 1C); therefore diminished attachment of ST6 cells is not due to a reduction in integrin expression. To assess the role of the β1 integrin in gal-3 binding, cell attachment was evaluated in the presence of anti-β1 integrin function blocking antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1D, anti-β1 blocking antibodies markedly inhibited the binding of parental cells to gal-3, and interestingly, also attenuated the binding of ST6Gal I expressors. These results suggest that β1 integrins play a major role in regulating cell adhesion to this lectin. Desialylation of ST6 Cells Increases Cell Adhesion to Galectin-3—To verify that α2-6 sialylation inhibits gal-3 binding, cells were treated with neuraminidase to remove sialic acids and then evaluated for binding to gal-3-coated plates. We first tested neuraminidase efficacy by monitoring the electrophoretic mobility of the β1 integrin following neuraminidase treatment. As shown in Fig. 2A, the mature form of the β1 integrin from ST6 cells has a reduced electrophoretic mobility as compared with integrins from Par cells; this altered mobility was previously confirmed to result from increased α2-6 sialylation (12Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Brunson B.A. Wakefield J.K. Frost A.R. Bellis S.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Neuraminidase treatment of integrins from ST6 cells caused a dose-dependent increase in the electrophoretic mobility of the mature β1 isoform, consistent with the enzymatic removal of sialic acids. In contrast, the electrophoretic mobility of mature β1 integrins from Par cells was not altered by neuraminidase treatment, consistent with the fact that parental SW48 cells do not express either α2-3 or α2-6 sialyltransferases (24Dall'Olio F. Chiricolo M. Lollini P. Lau J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Neuraminidase treatment also had no effect on the mobility of the precursor β1 isoform from either Par or ST6 cells, which was expected given that the precursor is thought to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (and is therefore not a substrate for ST6Gal-I). As shown in Fig. 2B, ST6 cells treated with neuraminidase demonstrated a 3-fold increase in gal-3 binding as compared with untreated ST6 cells. In contrast, neuraminidase treatment had no effect on the binding of parental cells to gal-3. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that α2-6 sialylation inhibits the binding of SW48 cells to gal-3. α2-6 Sialylation of β1 Integrins Abolishes Galectin-3 Binding—To determine whether gal-3 binds directly to β1 integrins, we used a gal-3 overlay technique. Briefly, β1 integrins were immunoprecipitated from either parental or ST6Gal-I-expressing cells, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was then overlaid with an AP-conjugated gal-3. As shown in Fig. 3, AP-conjugated gal-3 can directly bind to the mature form of β1 integrins immunoprecipitated from parental, but not ST6Gal-I-expressing, cells. These data suggest that α2-6 sialylation of β1 integrins blocks gal-3 binding. Interestingly, a higher molecular weight band was also detected in the gal-3 overlay of β1 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that another gal-3 ligand associates with, and is co-precipitated by, β1. The identity of this glycoprotein is currently unknown. To verify that equal amounts of β1 were precipitated, duplicate immunoprecipitated samples were immunoblotted for β1 (Fig. 3). Notably, gal-3 does not appear to bind to the precursor β1 isoform, which is consistent with the hypothesis that this endoplasmic reticulum-resident β1 isoform is modified with high mannose-type glycans that are not substrates for galectins. α2-6 Sialylation of Cell Surface Proteins Does Not Alter the Expression Level or Subcellular Localization of Endogenous Galectin-3—A number of studies have reported that gal-3 is highly expressed in tumor cells, including colon cancer cells (27Lahm H. Andre S. Hoeflich A. Kaltner H. Siebert H.C. Sordat B. von der Lieth C.W. Wolf E. Gabius H.J. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); therefore we tested whether SW48 cells produce endogenous gal-3. To evaluate the levels of endogenous gal-3, lysates from parental, EV, and ST6Gal-I-expressing SW48 cells were immunoblotted. Results from these experiments showed that Par, EV, and ST6 cells express similar levels of endogenous gal-3 but no detectable gal-1. Promonocytic U937 cells were included as a positive control for gal-1 (Fig. 4A). In addition to assessing gal-3 protein levels, gal-3 subcellular distribution was monitored by immunofluorescent microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, the staining of endogenous gal-3 was mainly cytoplasmic in all three SW48 populations, which is noteworthy in light of studies suggesting that a cytoplasmic localization of gal-3 is pro-tumorigenic (15Liu F.T. Rabinovich G.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 16Dumic J. Dabelic S. Flogel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 616-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that Par, EV, and ST6 cells all produce robust amounts of endogenous, cytoplasmic gal-3, and forced expression of ST6Gal-I does not alter either gal-3 levels or subcellular distribution.

https://openalex.org/W2149665972,"Suppression of tumorigenicity 18 (ST18) and the homologues neural zinc-finger protein-3 (NZF3) and myelin transcription factor 3 (Myt3) are transcription factors with unknown function. Previous studies have established that they repress transcription of a synthetic reporter construct consisting of the consensus sequence AAAGTTT linked to the thymidine kinase promoter. In addition, ST18 exhibits significantly reduced expression in breast cancer and breast cancer cell lines. We report here for the first time evidence that ST18 mediates tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha induced mRNA levels of proapoptotic and proinflammatory genes in fibroblasts by mRNA profiling and silencing with ST18 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Gene set enrichment analysis and mRNA profiling support this conclusion by identifying several apoptotic and inflammatory pathways that are down-regulated by ST18 siRNA. In addition, ST18 siRNA reduces TNF-induced fibroblast apoptosis and caspase-3/7 activity. Fibroblasts that overexpress ST18 by transient transfection exhibit significantly increased apoptosis and increased expression of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL) -1alpha, and IL-6. In addition, cotransfection of ST18 and a TNF-alpha or IL-1alpha reporter construct demonstrates that ST18 overexpression in fibroblasts significantly enhanced promoter activity of these genes. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the transcription factor ST18/NZF3 regulates the mRNA levels of proapoptotic and proinflammatory genes in revealing a previously unrecognized function."
https://openalex.org/W1981472687,"The putative gene fgaMT was identified in the biosynthetic gene cluster of fumigaclavines in Aspergillus fumigatus. The coding region of fgaMT was amplified by PCR from a cDNA library, cloned into pQE60, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. FgaMT comprises 339 amino acids with a molecular mass of about 38.1 kDa. The soluble dimeric His6-FgaMT was purified to near homogeneity and characterized biochemically. FgaMT was found to catalyze the N-methylation of 4-dimethylallyltryptophan in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine, resulting in the formation of 4-dimethylallyl-l-abrine, which was identified by NMR and mass spectrometry analysis. Therefore, FgaMT represents the second pathway-specific enzyme in the biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids. The enzyme did not require metal ions for its enzymatic reaction and showed a relatively high specificity toward the prenyl moiety at position C-4 of the indole ring. 4-Dimethylallyltryptophan derivatives with modification at the indole ring were also accepted by FgaMT as substrates. Km values for 4-dimethylallyltryptophan and S-adenosylmethionine were determined at 0.12 and 2.4 mm, respectively. The turnover number was 2.0 s–1.

Ergot alkaloids are a complex family of indole derivatives with diverse biological activities (1.Schardl C.L. Panaccione D.G. Tudzynski P. Cordell G.A. The Alkaloid Chemistry and Biology. 63. Elsevier Inc., Amsterdam2006: 45-86Google Scholar) and produced mainly by fungi of the genera Claviceps, Penicillium, and Aspergillus (1.Schardl C.L. Panaccione D.G. Tudzynski P. Cordell G.A. The Alkaloid Chemistry and Biology. 63. Elsevier Inc., Amsterdam2006: 45-86Google Scholar, 2.Flieger M. Wurst M. Shelby R. Folia Microbiol. 1997; 42: 3-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Ergot alkaloids can be divided into two classes of compounds according to their structural features: the clavines and d-lysergic acid amides (2.Flieger M. Wurst M. Shelby R. Folia Microbiol. 1997; 42: 3-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3.Gröger D. Floss H.G. Cordell G.A. The Alkaloids: Chemistry and Biology. 50. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 171-218Google Scholar). The clavines merely consist of the tetracyclic ergoline ring, e.g. agroclavine and fumigaclavines A and C (Fig. 1), or its tricyclic seco derivatives, e.g. chanoclavine-I (Fig. 1). d-Lysergic acid-containing alkaloids, on the other hand, have substituents attached by amide bonds to the ergoline ring system. These substituents can be amino alcohols or tripeptide chains arranged in a unique bicyclic arrangement. The latter compounds are called ergopeptines, e.g. ergotamine (Fig. 1), and are widely used as therapeutic agents (1.Schardl C.L. Panaccione D.G. Tudzynski P. Cordell G.A. The Alkaloid Chemistry and Biology. 63. Elsevier Inc., Amsterdam2006: 45-86Google Scholar). Ergot alkaloids of the clavine type are also biologically active. For example, in vitro experiments have shown that fumigaclavine C has various pharmacological activities such as improvement of experimental colitis (4.Wu X.-F. Fei M.-J. Shu R.-G. Tan R.-X. Xu Q. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2005; 5: 1543-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and concanavalin A-induced liver injury in mice (5.Zhao Y. Liu J. Wang J. Wang L. Yin H. Tan R. Xu Q. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 2004; 56: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as relaxation of isolated rat aortic rings (6.Ma H.Y. Song Y.C. Mao Y.Y. Jiang J.H. Tan R.X. Luo L. Planta Med. 2006; 72: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The clavine type alkaloids fumigaclavines are produced by Penicillium and Aspergillus, e.g. Aspergillus fumigatus (2.Flieger M. Wurst M. Shelby R. Folia Microbiol. 1997; 42: 3-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), but not by the fungal family of the Clavicipitaceae, e.g. Claviceps purpurea (2.Flieger M. Wurst M. Shelby R. Folia Microbiol. 1997; 42: 3-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Conversely, the amides and peptides of lysergic acid are produced by C. purpurea, but not by A. fumigatus (2.Flieger M. Wurst M. Shelby R. Folia Microbiol. 1997; 42: 3-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, agroclavine was identified in both fungal groups (2.Flieger M. Wurst M. Shelby R. Folia Microbiol. 1997; 42: 3-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have proposed that the early stages of the biosynthetic pathway of ergot alkaloids up to agroclavine are shared by A. fumigatus and C. purpurea, whereas later steps in the pathways differ in the two fungi (Fig. 1) (7.Li S.-M. Unsöld I.A. Planta Med. 2006; 72: 1117-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids has been studied for more than 50 years, especially in the fungus Claviceps species and mainly by feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors and by enzyme extracts from the producers (1.Schardl C.L. Panaccione D.G. Tudzynski P. Cordell G.A. The Alkaloid Chemistry and Biology. 63. Elsevier Inc., Amsterdam2006: 45-86Google Scholar, 3.Gröger D. Floss H.G. Cordell G.A.

Stocking E.M. Sanz-Cervera J.F. Topics Curr. Chem. 2000; 209: 97-173Crossref Google Scholar). The results of these studies revealed clearly that the ergoline moiety is derived from tryptophan and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) 2The abbreviations used are: DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; DMA, dimethylallyl; 4-DMAT, 4-dimethylallyltryptophan; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. (8.Floss H.G. Tetrahedron. 1976; 32: 873-912Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 9.Williams R.M. Stocking E.M. Sanz-Cervera J.F. Topics Curr. Chem. 2000; 209: 97-173Crossref Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids starts with the formation of 4-dimethylallyltryptophan (4-DMAT) catalyzed by the first pathway-specific enzyme, 4-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase (DmaW). The tetracylic ergolene, agroclavine, was formed by methylation of 4-DMAT to 4-DMA-l-abrine and two subsequent oxidative ring closures along with decarboxylation of 4-DMA-l-abrine (Fig. 1). Investigation of the ergot alkaloid biosynthesis on molecular biological level began with the identification of the dmaW gene, which was amplified with PCR by using degenerate primers obtained from the purified 4-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase of Claviceps fusiformis (reported as C. purpurea) (10.Tsai H.F. Wang H. Gebler J.C. Poulter C.D. Schardl C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). By using the dmaW sequence, Tudzynski et al. (11.Tudzynski P. Holter K. Correia T. Arntz C. Grammel N. Keller U. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) identified a biosynthetic gene cluster of ergot alkaloids in C. purpurea. The functions of three genes from this cluster, cloA, cpps1, and cpps2 coding CloA, LPS1, and LPS2, respectively, were proven experimentally. The cytochrome P-450 enzyme CloA catalyzes the conversion of elymoclavine to paspalic acid (12.Haarmann T. Ortel I. Tudzynski P. Keller U. ChemBioChem. 2006; 7: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). LPS1 and LPS2 are involved in the connection of the tripeptidyl with lysergyl moieties (13.Riederer B. Han M. Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27524-27530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14.Walzel B. Riederer B. Keller U. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 223-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, all three enzymes catalyze the reactions in the biosynthesis of ergopeptines after formation of agroclavine (Fig. 1). By bioinformatic approaches, a biosynthetic gene cluster of fumigaclavine C was identified in the genome of A. fumigatus Af293 (7.Li S.-M. Unsöld I.A. Planta Med. 2006; 72: 1117-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15.Unsöld I.A. Li S.-M. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16.Coyle C.M. Panaccione D.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3112-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Functional proof of this cluster was provided by gene inactivation experiment (16.Coyle C.M. Panaccione D.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3112-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and by heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of two prenyltransferase genes fgaPT1 and fgaPT2 (15.Unsöld I.A. Li S.-M. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17.Unsöld I.A. Li S.-M. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). FgaPT2 and FgaPT1 catalyze the first and last pathway-specific reaction steps in the biosynthesis of fumigaclavine C, respectively. The identification of this cluster provides a convenient way to identify candidate genes for the early stages of the biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids by comparison of the two clusters in C. purpurea and A. fumigatus. Seven homologous genes are found in the biosynthetic gene cluster of fumigaclavines in A. fumigatus Af293 and of ergot alkaloids in C. purpurea (15.Unsöld I.A. Li S.-M. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16.Coyle C.M. Panaccione D.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3112-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These seven genes are proposed to be responsible for the common steps in the biosynthesis of fumigaclavines from A. fumigatus and of ergot alkaloids from C. purpurea, i.e. agroclavine (17.Unsöld I.A. Li S.-M. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster of fumigaclavine C also provides additional opportunities to investigate the function of genes involved in the formation of the clavine skeleton with genes from both clusters. Functional proof of genes and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites is the prerequisite for production of biologically active substances by using biochemical and molecular biological approaches such as combinatorial biosynthesis, mutasynthesis, or chemoenzymatic synthesis. Combinatorial biosynthesis was defined as the application of genetic engineering to modify biosynthetic pathways of natural products to produce new and altered structures using natural biosynthetic machinery (18.Floss H.G. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mutasynthesis or mutational biosynthesis combines genetic and chemical approaches and was successfully used in a number of bacterial systems to produce biologically active substances (19.Weist S. Süssmuth R.D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 68: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20.Galm U. Dessoy M.A. Schmidt J. Wessjohann L.A. Heide L. Chem.

Trends Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 139-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Chemoenzymatic synthesis is an in vitro approach with help of purified proteins and was used successfully in the synthesis of peptides (22.Grunewald J. Marahiel M.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), glycopeptides (23.Buskas T. Ingale S. Boons G.J. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 113R-136RCrossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), nucleotide deoxysugars (24.Rupprath C. Schumacher T. Elling L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 1637-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), glycan libraries (25.Blixt O. Razi N. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and glycosides (26.Langenhan J.M. Griffith B.R. Thorson J.S. J. Nat. Prod. 2005; 68: 1696-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, only one enzyme in the biosynthesis of agroclavine was functionally identified until now, i.e. the first pathway-specific enzyme of the ergot alkaloid biosynthesis DmaW from C. fusiformis (10.Tsai H.F. Wang H. Gebler J.C. Poulter C.D. Schardl C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and its orthologue in Neotyphodium lolii × Epichloë typhina (27.Wang J. Machado C. Panaccione D.G. Tsai H.F. Schardl C.L. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2004; 41: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as well as FgaPT2 from A. fumigatus (15.Unsöld I.A. Li S.-M. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Here we report on the biochemical characterization of an N-methyltransferase catalyzing the second step of the ergot alkaloid biosynthesis in A. fumigatus as well as its specificity toward aromatic substrates. Computer-assisted Sequence Analysis—FGENESH (Softberry, Inc.) and the DNASIS software package (version 2.1; Hitachi Software Engineering, San Bruno, CA) were used for intron prediction and sequence analysis, respectively. Sequence similarities were obtained by alignments of amino acid sequences using the BLAST program BLAST 2 Sequences (release 2.9.9). Chemicals—Trisammonium salt of DMAPP was prepared by analogy with the synthesis of trisammonium geranyl diphosphate reported by Woodside et al. (28.Woodside A.B. Huang Z. Poulter C.D. Org. Synth. 1988; 66: 211-215Crossref Google Scholar). S-Adenosylmethionine was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—pGEM-T and pQE60 were obtained from Promega and Qiagen, respectively. A Uni-ZAP® XR Premade Library of A. fumigatus strain B5233 (ATCC13073) was purchased from Stratagene and used to obtain phagemids as cDNA template for PCR amplification. Escherichia coli XL1 Blue MRF′ (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was used for cloning and expression experiments and grown in liquid or on solid Luria-Bertani medium with 1.5% (w/v) agar at 37 °C (29.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor2001Google Scholar). 50 μg of carbenicillin ml–1 was used for selection of recombinant E. coli strains. DNA Isolation, PCR Amplification, and Cloning—Standard procedures for DNA isolation and manipulation were performed as described (29.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor2001Google Scholar). PCR amplification was carried out on an iCycler from Bio-Rad. A PCR fragment of 1034 bp containing the entire coding sequence of fgaMT was amplified using Expand High Fidelity Kit (Roche Applied Science) from the cDNA library of A. fumigatus B5233 rather than the genome reference strain Af293 by using the primers fgaMT-for (5′-CAGCCACCATGGCGATTTCAGCTCC-3′) at the 5′-end and fgaMT_rev2 (5′-CATGGATCCGTTCAGACGCAGTCTCAA-3′) at the 3′-end of the gene. The bold letters represent mutations inserted in comparison with the original genome sequence to give the underlined restriction sites NcoI located at the start codon in fgaMT_for and BamHI located at the predicted stop codon in fgaMT_rev2. The PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T, resulting in plasmid pOR13, which was subsequently sequenced (MWG Biotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany) to confirm the sequence. To create the expression vector pOR15, pOR13 was digested with NcoI and BamHI, and the resulting NcoI-BamHI fragment of 1023 bp was ligated into pQE60, which had been digested with the same enzymes, previously. Overproduction and Purification of His6-FgaMT—For gene expression, E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ cells harboring the plasmid pOR15 were cultivated in 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of liquid Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μgml–1) and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. For induction, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were cultivated for further 16 h at 37 °C before harvest. The bacterial cultures were centrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) at 2–5 ml/gram of wet weight. After the addition of 1 mg ml–1 lysozyme and incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were sonicated six times for 10 s each at 200 W. To separate the cellular debris from the soluble proteins, the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. One-step purification of the recombinant His6-tagged fusion protein by affinity chromatography with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. To change the buffer, the protein fraction was passed through a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 15% (v/v) of glycerol, pH 7.5, previously. FgaMT was eluted with the same buffer and stored frozen at –80 °C for enzyme assays. Protein Analysis—The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Determination of Molecular Mass of Active His6-FgaMT—The molecular mass of the recombinant His6-FgaMT was determined by gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare), which had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated with dextran blue 2000 (2000 kDa), conalbumin (75 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa) (GE Healthcare). The proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The molecular mass of the recombinant His6-FgaMT was determined as 75 kDa. This proved that FgaMT acts as a homodimer. Tandem Assays with FgaPT2 and FgaMT—All of the enzyme assays contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.2–3.8% (v/v) of glycerol. They differed from each other by incubation volume and time, substrate concentration, and amount of the recombinant FgaMT. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated by addition of 100 μl of methanol/100-μl reaction mixtures. After removal of the protein by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), the enzymatic products were analyzed on a HPLC system described below. The enzyme assays of FgaPT2 (100 μl) contained 1 mm l-tryptophan or its derivatives, 2 mm DMAPP, 5 mm CaCl2, and 20 μg (180 pmol) of FgaPT2. After conversion of l-tryptophan or its derivatives to 4-DMAT and its respective derivatives by incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, aliquots of the reaction mixture in 50 μl were used for FgaMT assays, which contained 1 mm SAM and different amounts of purified FgaMT and had a final volume of 100 μl. Two independent assays were carried out routinely. The assays for determination of the kinetic parameters (100 μl) of 4-DMAT contained 5.0 mm SAM, 1 μg (13 pmol) of FgaMT and 4-DMAT at final concentrations of 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1, 0.2, 0.35, 0.5, and 0.7 mm. For determination of the kinetic parameters of SAM, 1 μg (13 pmol) of FgaMT, 4-DMAT at 0.5 mm, and SAM at final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 10 mm were used. The incubation time was 30 min. The reaction mixture of FgaMT for the isolation of the enzymatic product for structural elucidation (5 ml) was incubated with 50 μg (650 pmol) of purified FgaMT for 16 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotation evaporator at 35 °C to a volume of 300 μl before injection to HPLC for isolation of 4-dimethylallyl-l-abrine. HPLC Analysis and Isolation of 4-Dimethylallyl-l-abrine (Method 1)—Reaction mixtures of FgaPT2 and FgaMT were analyzed on an Agilent HPLC Series 1100 using an Eclipse XBD-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm; Agilent) at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. Water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), each containing 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, were used as solvents. The substances were detected with a Photo Diode Array detector. The reaction mixtures of l-tryptophan and 4-methyl-dl-tryptophan with FgaMT were detected by Methods 2 and 3 described below, respectively. All other assays were analyzed by using a gradient from 30% to 70% B in 23 min. After washing with 100% solvent B for 5 min, the column was equilibrated with 70% solvent A for 7 min. 4-Dimethylallyl-l-abrine was isolated under the same condition. HPLC Analysis of l-Tryptophan and l-Abrine (Method 2)—For identification of incubation mixture of FgaMT with l-tryptophan, the same HPLC equipment as for the analysis of 4-dimethylallyl-l-abrine was used but with the following gradient: from 15% A to 70% B in 15 min. After washing with 100% solvent B for 5 min, the column was equilibrated with 85% solvent A for 5 min. HPLC Analysis of 4-Methyl-dl-tryptophan and 4-Methylabrine (Method 3)—For identification of incubation mixture of FgaMT with 4-methyl-dl-tryptophan, the same HPLC equipment as for the analysis of 4-dimethylallyl-l-abrine was used but with the following gradient: from 25% A to 60% B in 15 min. After washing with 100% solvent B for 5 min, the column was equilibrated with 75% solvent A for 5 min. 1H NMR Data of 4-Dimethylallyl-l-abrine—1H NMR spectrum of the enzymatic product was taken on an Avance DRX 500 spectrometer (Bruker) using D2O as solvent. The solvent signal at 4.81 ppm was used as reference. δ ppm (multiplicity, Hz): 7.40 (d, 8.4, H-7), 7.32 (s, H-2), 7.21 (t, 7.9, H-6), 6.99 (d, 7.6, H-5), 5.36 (t, 6.2, H-2′), 3.91 (dd, 8.4, 5.9, H-11), 3.78 (d, 6.2, 2H-1′), 3.62 (dd, 15.8, 5.4, H-10), 3.41 (dd, 15.8, 8.7, H-10), 2.67 (s, N-CH3), 1.80 (s, H-4′), 1.76 (s, H-5′). These data corresponded well to those published previously (31.Steffan N. Unsöld I.A. Li S.-M. ChemBioChem. 2007; 8: 1298-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ESI-MS of the Enzymatic Products—The positive and negative ESI-MS was carried out with a ThermoFinnigan TSQ Quantum. The mass spectrometer was coupled with an Agilent HPLC series 1100 equipped with a RP18 column (2 × 250 mm, 5 μm). For separation, the column was run with 10% solvent B (methanol) in solvent A (water, each containing 0.1% HCOOH) for 5 min, followed by a gradient from 10% to 100% B over 30 min. After washing with 100% B, the column was equilibrated with 10% B for 10 min. The flow rate was at 0.2 ml min–1. The results of mass spectroscopic analysis are given in Table 1.TABLE 1The positive and negative ESI-MS data of the enzymatic products of FgaPT2 and FgaMTSubstrateFgaPT2 reactionFgaPT2 and FgaMT reactionProductMr[M + H]+[M - H]-ProductMr[M + H]+[M - H]-l-Tryptophan4-l-DMAT272.2273.2271.24-DMA-abrine286.2287.2285.4d-Tryptophan4-d-DMAT272.2273.2271.2No product286.24-Methyl-dl-tryptophanNot determined4-Methyl-abrinea4-Methyl-dl-tryptophan was only incubated with FgaMT and SAM.232.2233.2231.15-Methyl-dl-tryptophan5-Methyl-4-DMAT286.2287.0285.75-Methyl-4-DMA-abrine300.2301.2299.26-Methyl-dl-tryptophan6-Methyl-4-DMAT286.2287.0285.76-Methyl-4-DMA-abrine300.2301.2299.27-Methyl-dl-tryptophan7-Methyl-4-DMAT286.2287.0285.87-Methyl-4-DMA-abrine300.2301.2299.2a 4-Methyl-dl-tryptophan was only incubated with FgaMT and SAM. Open table in a new tab Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number—The nucleotide sequence of the genomic DNA from A. fumigatus Af293 reported in this study is available at GenBank™ under the accession number AAHF01000001.1. The coding sequence of fgaMT from A. fumigatus B5233 was deposited at GenBank™ under the accession number EU827256. Sequence Analysis of the Putative Methyltransferase Gene AFUA_2G18060—The hypothetical gene AFUA_2G18060 was identified in the biosynthetic gene cluster of fumigaclavine C in A. fumigatus (15.Unsöld I.A. Li S.-M. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Analysis by using FGENESH (see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed that this gene consists probably of two exons of 748 and 272 bp, respectively, interrupted by an intron of 72 bp. It spans bp 4798099–4799190 of AAHF01000001.1 (GenBank™). The deduced product of AFUA_2G18060, EAL94105, comprises 339 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 38.1 kDa. Data base search revealed sequence similarity between EAL94105 and OrfB (EasF) proteins (1.Schardl C.L. Panaccione D.G. Tudzynski P. Cordell G.A. The Alkaloid Chemistry and Biology. 63. Elsevier Inc., Amsterdam2006: 45-86Google Scholar) in the biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids from different sources. For example, by using the program BLAST 2 Sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”), EAL94105 shares an identity of 60% with OrfB from N. lolii (32.Fleetwood D.J. Scott B. Lane G.A. Tanaka A. Johnson R.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 2571-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and 53% with OrfB from C. purpurea (1.Schardl C.L. Panaccione D.G. Tudzynski P. Cordell G.A. The Alkaloid Chemistry and Biology. 63. Elsevier Inc., Amsterdam2006: 45-86Google Scholar) and C. fusiformis (33.Lorenz N. Wilson E.V. Machado C. Schardl C.L. Tudzynski P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 7185-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), respectively. It was speculated that OrfB could be responsible for the methylation of 4-DMAT (1.Schardl C.L. Panaccione D.G. Tudzynski P. Cordell G.A. The Alkaloid Chemistry and Biology. 63. Elsevier Inc., Amsterdam2006: 45-86Google Scholar, 32.Fleetwood D.J. Scott B. Lane G.A. Tanaka A. Johnson R.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 2571-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, no experimental data on the function of OrfB are available in the literature. No conserved motifs for methyltransferases (34.Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 35.Kozbial P.Z. Mushegian A.R. BMC. Struct. Biol. 2005; 5: 19-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) could be found in the sequence of EAL94105. Therefore, FgaMT belongs to a new enzyme group. Cloning of fgaMT, Overproduction, and Purification of His6-FgaMT—To prove the function of AFUA_2G18060, we have amplified its orthologue in A. fumigatus strain B5233, termed fgaMT in this study, by using PCR from a cDNA library in phagemid form. The PCR product of 1034 bp was cloned into the cloning vector pGEM-T, resulting in pOR13. Sequencing of pOR13 confirmed the predicted gene sequence and exon/intron structure. For gene expression, the coding sequence of fgaMT was released from pOR13 and cloned into the expression vector pQE60 for E. coli to give the expression construct pOR15. E. coli cells harboring pOR15 were induced by 1 mm of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C. Gene expression was clearly observed after induction for 16 h (Fig. 2). His6-FgaMT was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose to near homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), and a protein yield of 13 mg of purified His6-tagged FgaMT/liter of culture was obtained. The observed molecular mass was 40 kDa and corresponded well to the calculated value of 39.2 kDa for His6-FgaMT. Enzymatic Activity, Substrate Specificity, and Identification of the Enzymatic Products—For determination of the enzymatic activity of FgaMT, tandem incubations of l-tryptophan with FgaPT2 and FgaMT were carried out. Incubation of l-tryptophan with FgaPT2 in the presence of DMAPP resulted in formation of 4-DMAT with a retention time of 11.2 min (Fig. 3A), as observed in our previous studies (15.Unsöld I.A. Li S.-M. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31.Steffan N. Unsöld I.A. Li S.-M. ChemBioChem. 2007; 8: 1298-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This reaction mixture was then incubated with the purified FgaMT and SAM. As shown in Fig. 3B, an additional peak at 12.3 min could be detected in the HPLC chromatogram. This peak had the same retention time as 4-dimethylallyl-l-abrine (Fig. 3C), which was obtained by an incubation of l-abrine with FgaPT2 in the presence of DMAPP (31.Steffan N. Unsöld I.A. Li S.-M. ChemBioChem. 2007; 8: 1298-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Formation of the peak at 12.3 min was dependent on the presence of SAM and active recombinant FgaMT (Fig. 3, D and E). Product formation showed a linear dependence on the amount of protein up to 5 μg/100-μl assay and on the incubation time up to 60 min (data not shown). For structural elucidation, the enzymatic product was subsequently isolated on a preparative"
https://openalex.org/W2035483254,"Adiponectin is an adipokine with potent anti-inflammatory properties. Treatment of macrophages with adiponectin results in a suppression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cytokine production. Here we investigated the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms by which adiponectin suppresses LPS-stimulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production. Treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with LPS increased TNF-alpha promoter-driven luciferase activity (TNF-alpha promoter/Luc activity) by 20-fold over basal. After culture with 1 mug/ml globular adiponectin (gAcrp) for 18 h, TNF-alpha promoter/Luc activity was increased even in the absence of LPS; further challenge with LPS only increased TNF-alpha promoter/Luc activity by 1.4-fold. Treatment with gAcrp decreased LPS-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and IkappaB degradation and suppressed the ability of LPS to increase the DNA binding activity of Egr-1 and p65. gAcrp also suppressed LPS-mediated stabilization of TNF-alpha mRNA. In controls cells, the half-life of TNF-alpha mRNA was increased from approximately 30 min at base line to approximately 80 min in response to LPS. After treatment with gAcrp for 18 h, LPS failed to increase TNF-alpha mRNA stability. This gAcrp-mediated loss of stimulus-induced stabilization of TNF-alpha mRNA required the presence of the TNF-alpha 3'-untranslated region and was associated with an increase in expression and RNA binding activity of tristetraprolin, an mRNA-binding protein that destabilizes TNF-alpha mRNA. In summary, these data characterize the complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects of gAcrp on LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha expression in macrophages. gAcrp treatment profoundly suppressed the ability of LPS to increase TNF-alpha transcription and reduced the stimulus-induced stabilization of TNF-alpha mRNA in response to LPS."
https://openalex.org/W2132940151,"A significant unresolved question is how vitamin A deprivation causes, and why retinoic acid fails to reverse, immunodeficiency. When depleted of vitamin A, T cells undergo programmed cell death (PCD), which is enhanced by the natural competitor of retinol, anhydroretinol. PCD does not happen by apoptosis, despite the occurrence of shared early events, including mitochondrial membrane depolarization, permeability transition pore opening, and cytochrome c release. It also lacks caspase-3 activation, chromatin condensation, and endonuclease-mediated DNA degradation, hallmarks of apoptosis. PCD following vitamin A deprivation exhibits increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), drastic reductions in ATP and NAD(+) levels, and activation of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) -1. These latter steps are causative because neutralizing ROS, imposing hypoxic conditions, or inhibiting PARP-1 by genetic or pharmacologic approaches prevents energy depletion and PCD. The data highlight a novel regulatory role of vitamin A in mitochondrial energy homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2069436365,"In eukaryotes, proteins of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) family are believed to have a general role for the fusion of intracellular transport vesicles with acceptor membranes. Arabidopsis thaliana PEN1 syntaxin resides in the plasma membrane and was previously shown to act together with its partner SNAREs, the adaptor protein SNAP33, and endomembrane-anchored VAMP721/722 in the execution of secretory immune responses against powdery mildew fungi. We conducted a structure-function analysis of PEN1 and show that N-terminal phospho-mimicking and non-phosphorylatable variants neither affected binary nor ternary SNARE complex formation with cognate partners in vitro. However, expression of these syntaxin variants at native protein levels in a pen1 mutant background suggests that phosphorylation is required for full resistance activity in planta. All tested site-directed substitutions of SNARE domain or “linker region” residues reduced PEN1 defense activity. Two of the variants failed to form ternary complexes with the partner SNAREs in vitro, possibly explaining their diminished in planta activity. However, impaired pathogen defense in plants expressing a linker region variant is likely because of PEN1 destabilization. Although Arabidopsis PEN1 and SYP122 syntaxins share overlapping functions in plant growth and development, PEN1 activity in disease resistance is apparently the result of a complete functional specialization. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that PEN1 acts in plant defense through the formation of ternary SNARE complexes and point to the existence of unknown regulatory factors.

Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) 3The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein (SNAP) receptor; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; mYFP, monomeric yellow fluorescent protein; cCFP, cerulean fluorescent protein; hpi, h post-inoculation; WT, wild type; SM, Sec1/Munc; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GUS, β-glucuronidase. proteins in animals, plants, protists, and fungi identified in each kingdom a splitting of four main branches (1.Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 2.Kloepper T.H. Kienle C.N. Fasshauer D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3463-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These four phylogenetic groups coincide with four distinctive SNARE motif profiles (designated Qa-, Qb-, Qc-, and R-SNAREs (1.Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar)), which likely reflect the principal nature of the structural arrangement of oligoheteromeric SNARE proteins into canonical four-helix bundle structures across eukaryotic kingdoms. Compared with yeast and animals, higher plant genomes encode a disproportionately large number of SNARE proteins, which might be indicative of a greater level of functional diversification and possible engagements in plant-specific vesicle transport processes (3.Lipka V. Kwon C. Panstruga R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 147-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 4.Sanderfoot A. Plant Physiol. 2007; 144: 6-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Indeed, different plant SNAREs have been assigned functions in cytokinesis, shoot gravitropism, pathogen defense, symbiosis, abiotic stress responses, and trafficking to protein storage or lytic vacuoles (3.Lipka V. Kwon C. Panstruga R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 147-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Plants have evolved an elaborate immune system that detects non-self structures through a diversified repertoire of membrane-resident cell surface and intracellular immune receptors (5.Shen Q.H. Schulze-Lefert P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4293-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed the existence of secretory machineries that become engaged in the execution of extracellular immune responses. At least two SNARE protein-mediated exocytosis pathways appear to drive focal and/or non-directional secretion of antimicrobials, comprising defense-related proteins, and/or cell wall building blocks into the apoplastic space to terminate the pathogenesis of fungal or bacterial intruders (6.Collins N.C.

Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 1575-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical experiments revealed that the two pathogen-induced secretory machineries rely on plasma membrane-resident syntaxins of the same subfamily, PEN1 (AtSYP121) in Arabidopsis and NbSYP132 in Nicotiana benthamiana (6.Collins N.C.

Genetically supported evidence for additional SNARE proteins in Arabidopsis pathogen defense is at present limited to vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) 721 and 722. PEN1 has been shown to interact and form ternary SNARE complexes in vitro and in vivo with synaptosomal-associated protein of 33 kDa (SNAP33) and VAMP721/722 (8.Kwon C. Neu C. Pajonk S. Yun H.S.

In monocotyledonous barley, the disease resistance function of their presumed orthologs (HvROR2 syntaxin, HvSNAP34, and HvVAMP721) is conserved, including SNARE complex formation of the gene products in vivo during transient co-expression of the respective partner SNAREs in single leaf epidermal cells (6.Collins N.C.

Plant Physiol. 2007; 144: 6-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), PEN1 shares the highest level of sequence relatedness with SYP122 (63% amino acid identity). Both syntaxins reside in the plasma membrane and exert overlapping functions in growth and development because pen1 syp122 double mutant plants, but not the respective single mutants, are severely dwarfed and necrotic (14.Assaad F.F.

PEN1 exerts an additional function in plant innate immunity because pen1 mutants allow enhanced entry of non-adapted powdery mildew fungi such as Blumeria graminis and Erysiphe pisi into leaf epidermal cells (6.Collins N.C.

Despite focal co-accumulation of PEN1 and SYP122 beneath incipient B. graminis f. sp. hordei (B. g. hordei) entry sites (14.Assaad F.F. Qiu J.L. Youngs H. Ehrhardt D. Zimmerli L. Kalde M. Wanner G.

However, SYP122 could share another redundant defense function with PEN1 that would be detectable only in pen1 syp122 plants. Unfortunately, the double mutants cannot be used for meaningful infection experiments because of severe pleiotropic effects (14.Assaad F.F. Qiu J.L. Youngs H. Ehrhardt D. Zimmerli L. Kalde M.

We have re-examined the potential functional specialization of PEN1 and SYP122 in defense responses to the non-adapted powdery mildew fungus B. g. hordei by gene dosage experiments and a chimeric syntaxin. Because the contribution of conserved SNARE motif residues to secretion has been extensively studied in syntaxins of vertebrates, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster, but not in plants, we have conducted a structure-function analysis of PEN1 syntaxin in planta and in vitro. This revealed a critical role of the corresponding residues in the PEN1 linker region and the SNARE motif for immune responses. We show that equivalent amino acid substitutions in syntaxins from different kingdoms can have different functional consequences in exocytosis, which might reflect different modes of regulating secretory SNARE complexes. Using phospho-mimicking and non-phosphorylatable PEN1 variants, we also provide evidence that phosphorylation of N-terminal PEN1 syntaxins is required for full defense activity. Our study underlines the importance of conducting structure-function analysis of SNAREs in a whole organism context at native expression levels. Plant Materials—Arabidopsis and barley plants were soil-grown in growth chambers at 20–23 °C with a 10-h photoperiod and a light intensity of ∼150 μEm–2 s–1. Total proteins were extracted by grinding leaves from 3- or 4-week-old plants in liquid nitrogen and resuspending in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. The extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. Protein concentration in the supernatant was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). To generate Arabidopsis plants containing different PEN1 and SYP122 gene dosages, homozygous pen1-1 (6.Collins N.C. Thordal-Christensen H. Lipka V. Bau S. Kombrink E. Qiu J.L. Huckelhoven R. Stein M.

Zimmerli L. Kalde M. Wanner G. Peck S.C. Edwards H. Ramonell K. Somerville C.R. Thordal-Christensen H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5118-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar)) single mutants were crossed, and the resulting F1 plants were self-fertilized to produce segregating F2 siblings. Homo- or heterozygosity at the PEN1 and SYP122 loci was determined by PCR on genomic DNA isolated from F2 individuals. The pen1-1 mutation was identified using primer CAPS-F (5′-CAACGAAACACTCTCTTCATGTCACGC-3′) and CAPS-R (5′-CATCAATTTCTTCCTGAGAC-3′) for amplification and subsequent amplicon digestion with MluI. The T-DNA insertion present in the syp122-1 allele was determined by PCR using genomic DNA from F2 individuals as previously described (14.Assaad F.F. Qiu J.L. Youngs H. Ehrhardt D. Zimmerli L. Kalde M. Wanner G. Peck S.C. Edwards H. Ramonell K. Somerville C.R. Thordal-Christensen H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5118-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To generate PEN1 variants, splicing by overlap extension PCR was performed using oligonucleotides encoding the desired site-directed substitutions (supplemental Table 1). The resulting PCR fragments were introduced into pDONR (Invitrogen). To generate a chimeric syntaxin protein (2211) composed of the N-terminal 175 amino acids of SYP122 followed by the C-terminal 171 amino acids of PEN1, PEN1 and SYP122 cDNAs in pDONR vector were digested with SgrAI and ApaI. The digested DNA fragment encoding SYP122 N terminus was re-ligated with the reciprocal fragment of pDONR-PEN1 encoding the PEN1 C terminus. To produce N-terminal fluorochrome-tagged versions of the PEN1 and SYP122 variants, the respective coding sequences in pDONR vector were introduced into a binary plant transformation vector based on pAM-PAT-GW 4B. Ülker, unpublished information. by gateway cloning, containing either monomeric yellow (mYFP) or cerulean fluorescent protein (cCFP) coding sequence in frame with the gateway cassette (GW). 1.2 kilobases of PEN1 5′ regulatory DNA sequence (pPEN1) or 35 S promoter was engineered to drive the expression of the transgene, resulting in pPEN1::mYFP-GW or 35S::cCFP-GW. Stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines were generated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of flowering pen1-1 plants. T1-transformants were selected by BASTA (Bayer) application, and the expression level of the engineered proteins was examined by immunoblot analysis of total plant leaf extracts using anti-PEN1 or anti-SYP122 antiserum (12.Nühse T.S.

Purification of Recombinant Proteins—To express and purify recombinant proteins, coding sequences of PEN1 variants (supplemental Table 1), SYP122, the chimeric syntaxin (2211), VAMP722, and SNAP33/SNAP33Δ25 were introduced into pDONR to generate GW entry clones. Subsequently, coding sequences were shuttled by LR recombination reactions either into the GW-compatible pGEX-6p-1 (Amersham Biosciences) GST fusion vector (SNAP33/SNAP33Δ25) or into derivatives of this vector, 5S. Pajonk, unpublished information. harboring in addition to the N-terminal GST label either an additional His6 (syntaxin) or HA (VAMP722) tag. After verification by DNA sequencing, plasmid DNA constructs were introduced into Escherichia coli Rosetta (Invitrogen), and protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). To remove the N-terminal GST moiety (in case of GST/His6-double tagged syntaxins and the GST/HA-double-tagged VAMP722), Precision protease (Amersham Biosciences) was used, and the eluted GST-free proteins were collected. The resulting purified recombinant GST-SNAP33/SNAP33Δ25 (immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose 4B), His6-syntaxin, and HA-VAMP722 polypeptides were used for GST pulldown assays as described below. Immunoblot Analysis—In vitro pairwise or ternary SNARE complex formation assays were performed by incubating equimolar amounts (2 μm each) of purified recombinant proteins in a binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The bound proteins were pulled down by sedimenting immobilized GST-SNAP33 or GST-SNAP33Δ25 and resuspended in sample buffer. After boiling, the supernatant was separated on polyacrylamide gels and probed with anti-His5 (Qiagen) or anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibody. To detect the SDS-resistant SNARE complex, boiling of the supernatant was omitted before polyacrylamide gel separation. To assess transgene expression, equal amounts (5–30 μg) of total protein extracts were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), immunoblot analysis was carried out using anti-PEN1 (16.Zhang Z.G. Feechan A. Pedersen C. Newman M.A. Qiu J.L. Olesen K.L. Thordal-Christensen H. Plant J. 2007; 49: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or anti-SYP122 (12.Nühse T.S. Boller T. Peck S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45248-45254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) antiserum. Confocal Imaging Microscopy—The intracellular localization of fluorescently tagged PEN1 variant proteins in transgenic Arabidopsis plants after B. g. hordei inoculation was inspected using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope equipped with an argon/helium-neon laser for mYFP excitation at 514 nm and a diode laser of 405 nm (Leica) for cCFP excitation. Overlay and analysis of the images was carried out using the Leica Confocal software (LCS Lite, Leica Microsystems) and Adobe Photoshop 8.0. Analysis of Entry Resistance to B. g. hordei in Arabidopsis Leaf Epidermal Cells—Three- to four-week-old plants were inoculated with B. g. hordei conidiospores with a conventional settling tower to maximize equal conidiospore distribution on leaves. Three leaves per plant were harvested at 72 h post-inoculation (hpi) and destained in ethanol for 24 h before overnight staining with 0.01% aniline blue solution (pH 9.5). Leaves were inspected by UV-light epifluorescence microscopy. On each leaf ∼100 interaction sites between a germinated conidiospore and an attacked epidermal cell were scored. At least three independent lines were tested for each construct with at least three independent repetitions. Student's t test was performed to test for statistical significance. Transient Gene Expression in Barley Leaf Epidermal Cells—Transient gene expression in single barley leaf epidermal cells was performed by ballistic transformation using coated gold particles as DNA carriers as described previously (17.Elliott C. Müller J. Miklis M. Bhatt R.A. Schulze-Lefert P. Panstruga R. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, segments of primary barley leaves (resistant mlo-3 genotype (18.Büschges R. Hollricher K. Panstruga R. Simons G. Wolter M. Frijters A. van Daelen R. van der Lee T. Diergaarde P. Groenendijk J. Töpsch S. Vos P. Salamini F. Schulze-Lefert P. Cell. 1997; 88: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar)) were placed on agar medium (1% phytoagar, 85 μm benzimidazole) and bombarded with DNA-coated gold particles (1 μm diameter; 5 μg plasmid DNA/bombardment) using a Bio-Rad PDS1000 Hepta Adapter system. Transformation of a plasmid (pUbi-GUS) encoding the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter protein allowed the subsequent identification of transformed cells. Plasmids harboring the test genes (HvMLO, HvSNAP34, or HvSNAP34Δ25) were co-transformed with the pUbi-GUS reporter plasmid. Expression of all genes was driven by the constitutive maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter. Four hours after transformation leaves were inoculated with a high density of B. g. hordei (isolate K1) conidiospores. Forty-eight hours post-inoculation leaves were stained for β-glucoronidase activity by vacuum infiltration of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucoronid (X-Gluc) solution and overnight incubation at 37 °C. Epiphytic fungal structures were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and interaction sites were evaluated by light microscopy. Fungal entry rates were calculated as the number of successfully penetrated transformed (GUS-stained) cells (indicated by presence of a fungal haustorium) in relation to all attacked transformed cells. Sequence Variation between PEN1 and SYP122 Determines Functional Specialization—To re-examine a potential contribution of SYP122 to B. g. hordei defense responses we performed a gene dosage experiment by selecting five plant genotypes each with different PEN1 and SYP122 doses (Fig. 1A). None of these plants was dwarfed or necrotic. Using a PEN1-specific antiserum, we determined in the respective genotypes PEN1 abundance in leaf protein extracts and scored in 3–4-week-old plants entry rates to B. g. hordei conidiospore attack. PEN1–/–SYP122+/+ and PEN1–/–SYP122+/– plants were severely defense-compromised (74–82% entry rates), whereas PEN1+/+SYP122+/+, PEN1+/+SYP122–/–, PEN1+/–SYP122+/–, and even PEN1+/–SYP122–/– genotypes showed similar levels of resistance (about 16–24%; Fig. 1A). Retained entry resistance in the latter two genotypes excludes a contribution of SYP122 to immune responses in the presence of only one PEN1 dose. Reduced gene dosage resulted in reduced PEN1 abundance in SYP122–/–PEN1+/– and SYP122+/–PEN1+/– plants (Fig. 1A, lower panel), indicating that PEN1 activity in defense responses and plant growth is buffered against these variations in steady-state levels. The more pronounced reduction in PEN1 levels in PEN1+/–SYP122–/– plants may account for the slight increase in B. g. hordei entry rates in this genotype, although the increase was statistically not significant (Fig. 1A). We found striking differences in PEN1 and SYP122 abundance changes in time-course experiments after pathogen challenge. Constitutively high PEN1 levels were detected before B. g. hordei inoculation (0 hpi) followed by a slight and sustained increase between 24 and 72 hpi (Fig. 1B). In contrast, low SYP122 levels in healthy plants were markedly and transiently elevated with a peak at 24 h after pathogen challenge (Fig. 1C). This extends previous observations on a marked SYP122 transcriptional up-regulation by fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens (14.Assaad F.F. Qiu J.L. Youngs H. Ehrhardt D. Zimmerli L. Kalde M. Wanner G. Peck S.C. Edwards H. Ramonell K. Somerville C.R. Thordal-Christensen H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5118-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Because termination of B. g. hordei entry attempts occurs at ∼12 hpi, this raised the possibility that the low amount of SYP122 at early time points is insufficient to confer effective disease resistance. To test this, we determined B. g. hordei entry rates in transgenic lines overexpressing functional cCFP-tagged SYP122 (35S::cCFP-SYP122 (14.Assaad F.F. Qiu J.L. Youngs H. Ehrhardt D. Zimmerli L. Kalde M. Wanner G. Peck S.C. Edwards H. Ramonell K. Somerville C.R. Thordal-Christensen H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5118-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar)) in the pen1-1 null mutant background. Although the encoded fusion protein accumulated to a high level in these plants, cCFP-SYP122 failed to complement the pen1 immune defect (Fig. 2, A and B). Because cCFP-SYP122 rescues the growth defect in a syp122 pen1 double mutant background (14.Assaad F.F. Qiu J.L. Youngs H. Ehrhardt D. Zimmerli L. Kalde M. Wanner G. Peck S.C. Edwards H. Ramonell K. Somerville C.R. Thordal-Christensen H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5118-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and, thus, retains functionality, we conclude that the functional specialization between SYP122 and PEN1 in entry resistance to B. g. hordei is complete and is likely determined by amino acid sequence variations between the two syntaxins. Although unlikely, it remains possible that the fusion protein complements the growth/development defect but not the pathogen defense function. To further examine the proposed functional specialization, we generated transgenic lines overexpressing a chimeric syntaxin in which 175 N-terminal PEN1 residues were substituted by corresponding SYP122 sequences (35S::cCFP-2211) in pen1-1 and pen1-1 syp122-1 backgrounds (Fig. 2A). Although the chimeric protein accumulated at fungal entry sites (supplemental Fig. 1), cCFP-2211-expressing plants neither rescued dwarfism in the pen1 syp122 background (tested in F2 progeny derived from crosses between pen1-1 plants expressing 35S::cCFP-2211 and the syp122-1 mutant, data not shown) nor resistance to B. g. hordei entry in the pen1-1 null mutant background in each of three independent transgenic lines tested (#5, #6, #7; Fig. 2B). This reveals potential intramolecular domain interactions between the N- and C-terminal parts that are critical for functionality of the respective wild-type proteins and limits the utility of domain swap experiments to delineate sequence motifs contributing to the functional specialization between the two syntaxin family members. PEN1 Phosphorylation Is Needed for Full Disease Resistance Activity—N-terminal serine residues that are shared among the Arabidopsis SYP12 group (comprising SYP121 (PEN1), SYP122, SYP123, SYP124, and SYP125; Fig. 3A) were previously shown to be differentially phosphorylated within minutes in response to elicitation with the bacterial flagellin-derived peptide flg22 at S6 and S8 positions of SYP122 and at S7 of PEN1 (10.Benschop J.J.

This provides direct evidence for rapid changes of post-translational modifications of the syntaxins in response to non-self recognition. To test the functional significance of serine phosphorylation sites, we generated phospho-mimic (serine to aspartate) and non-phosphorylatable (serine to alanine) variants (PEN1S7G, PEN1S6A,S7A,S8A, and PEN1S6D,S7D,S8D, Fig. 3A; supplemental Table 1). We also created a PEN1S7G variant to examine a potential functional contribution of glycine 7 located at the N terminus of SYP122 (Fig. 3A). The corresponding PEN1 derivatives were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (“Experimental Procedures”) and expressed as N-terminal fusions to mYFP driven by 1.2 kilobases of native 5′ regulatory PEN1 sequences in transgenic Arabidopsis lines carrying a pen1-1 null mutation.

However, the chromatin-mediated molecular and cellular events involved remain elusive. Here we describe specific physical and functional interactions of Parp-1 and Parp-2 with the transcriptional intermediary factor (TIF1beta) and the heterochromatin proteins (HP1) that affect endodermal differentiation. We show that Parp-2 binds to TIF1beta with high affinity both directly and through HP1alpha. Both partners colocalize at pericentric heterochromatin in primitive endoderm-like cells. Parp-2 also binds to HP1beta but not to HP1gamma. In contrast Parp-1 binds weakly to TIF1beta and HP1beta only. Both Parps selectively poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate HP1alpha. Using shRNA approaches, we provide evidence for distinct participation of both Parps in endodermal differentiation. Whereas Parp-2 and its activity are required for the relocation of TIF1beta to heterochromatic foci during primitive endodermal differentiation, Parp-1 and its activity modulate TIF1beta-HP1alpha association with consequences on parietal endodermal differentiation. Both Parps control TIF1beta transcriptional activity. In addition, this work identifies both Parps as new modulators of the HP1-mediated subcode histone.-Quénet, D., Gasser, V., Fouillen, L., Cammas, F., Sanglier-Cianferani, S., Losson, R., Dantzer, F.

https://openalex.org/W1965425611,"In yeast mitochondria, RNA degradation takes place through the coordinated activities of ySuv3 helicase and yDss1 exoribonuclease (mtEXO), whereas in bacteria, RNA is degraded via RNaseE, RhlB, PNPase, and enolase. Yeast lacking the Suv3 component of the mtEXO form petits and undergo a toxic accumulation of omega intron RNAs. Mammalian mitochondria resemble their prokaryotic origins by harboring a polyadenylation-dependent RNA degradation mechanism, but whether SUV3 participates in regulating RNA turnover in mammalian mitochondria is unclear. We found that lack of hSUV3 in mammalian cells subsequently yielded an accumulation of shortened polyadenylated mtRNA species and impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis. This suggests that SUV3 may serve in part as a component of an RNA degradosome, resembling its yeast ancestor. Reduction in the expression levels of oxidative phosphorylation components correlated with an increase in reactive oxygen species generation, whereas membrane potential and ATP production were decreased. These cumulative defects led to pleiotropic effects in mitochondria such as decreased mtDNA copy number and a shift in mitochondrial morphology from tubular to granular, which eventually manifests in cellular senescence or cell death. Thus, our results suggest that SUV3 is essential for maintaining proper mitochondrial function, likely through a conserved role in mitochondrial RNA regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2072099958,"Rhinoviruses are the major cause of the common cold and acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We previously reported rapid rhinovirus induction of intracellular superoxide anion, resulting in NF-kappaB activation and pro-inflammatory molecule production. The mechanisms of rhinovirus superoxide induction are poorly understood. Here we found that the proteolytic activation of the xanthine dehydrogenase/xanthine oxidase (XD/XO) system was required because pretreatment with serine protease inhibitors abolished rhinovirus-induced superoxide generation in primary bronchial and A549 respiratory epithelial cells. These findings were confirmed by Western blotting analysis and by silencing experiments. Rhinovirus infection induced intracellular depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) that was abolished by pretreatment with either XO inhibitor oxypurinol or serine protease inhibitors. Increasing intracellular GSH with exogenous H2S or GSH prevented both rhinovirus-mediated intracellular GSH depletion and rhinovirus-induced superoxide production. We propose that rhinovirus infection proteolytically activates XO initiating a pro-inflammatory vicious circle driven by virus-induced depletion of intracellular reducing power. Inhibition of these pathways has therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2020431987,"Pollen tube growth is influenced by interaction between pollen proteins and the pistil extracellular matrix. The transmitting tract-specific glycoprotein (NaTTS) and 120-kDa glycoprotein (120K) are two pistil arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) that share a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) and directly influence pollen tubes in Nicotiana alata. 120K and other extracellular matrix proteins are taken up and transported to vacuoles of growing pollen tubes. We hypothesize that signaling and trafficking processes inside pollen tubes are important for controlling pollen tube growth. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of pollen cDNAs using sequences from 120K and NaTTS as baits. We found that an S-RNase-binding protein (SBP1), a C2 domain-containing protein (NaPCCP), and a putative cysteine protease bound to the AGP baits. SBP1 from Petunia hybrida and Solanum chacoense is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds to S-RNase and other proteins. C2 domain-containing proteins bind lipids and can regulate myriad cellular processes. Cysteine proteases are often associated with the degradation of vacuolar proteins. Expression analysis revealed that transcripts for these proteins are expressed in mature pollen. NaPCCP and NaSBP1 were characterized further because of their potential roles in signaling and trafficking. In vitro pull-down assays verified binding between maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions, MBP::NaPCCP or MBP::NaSBP1 and glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST::AGP CTD fusions. NaSBP1 binds to the AGP CTDs through its helical and RING domains. NaPCCP binds through its C-terminal region. Binding between NaPCCP and NaSBP1 and the pistil AGPs may contribute to signaling and trafficking inside pollen tubes growing in planta."
https://openalex.org/W2000599591,"Stem cell population size is highly regulated across species and tissue types, and alterations are associated with premature tissue failure or cancer. We assessed whether the tumor suppressor and mediator of cell contact inhibition Nf2/merlin plays a role in governing the hematopoietic stem cell pool by stem cell-autonomous or niche-determined processes. Hematopoietic stem cells in Nf2-deficient mice were increased in number and demonstrated a marked shift in location to the circulation. These changes were entirely dependent on changes in the microenvironment, with a marked increase in trabecular bone and marrow vascularity associated with increased VEGF, but without cell-autonomous alterations in stem cell characteristics. Nf2/merlin is critical for maintaining normal structure and function of the hematopoietic stem cell niche. It limits both bone and vascular components, and our model suggests that it thereby constrains stem cell number and position."
https://openalex.org/W2091399375,"Glycoprotein H (gH) of herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) is involved in the complex mechanism of membrane fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell. Membrane interacting regions and potential fusion peptides have been identified in HSV-1 gH as well as glycoprotein B (gB). Because of the complex fusion mechanism of HSV-1, which requires four viral glycoproteins, and because there are only structural data for gB and glycoprotein D, many questions regarding the mechanism by which HSV-1 fuses its envelope with the host cell membrane remain unresolved. Previous studies have shown that peptides derived from certain regions of gH have the potential to interact with membranes, and based on these findings we have generated a set of peptides containing mutations in one of these domains, gH-(626-644), to investigate further the functional role of this region. Using a combination of biochemical, spectroscopic, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, we showed that the alpha-helical nature of this stretch of amino acids in gH is important for membrane interaction and that the aromatic residues, tryptophan and tyrosine, are critical for induction of fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2043359720,"Neutral sphingomyelinases (SMases) are involved in the induction of ceramide-mediated proapoptotic signaling under heat stress conditions. Although ceramide is an important mediator of apoptosis, the neutral SMase that is activated under heat stress has not been identified. In this study, we cloned an Mg2+-dependent neutral SMase from a zebrafish embryonic cell cDNA library using an Escherichia coli expression-cloning vector. Screening of the clones using an SMase activity assay with C6-7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl-sphingomyelin as the substrate resulted in the isolation of one neutral SMase cDNA clone. This cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 420 amino acids (putative molecular weight: 46,900) containing two predicted transmembrane domains in its C-terminal region. The cloned neutral SMase 1 acted as a mediator of stress-induced apoptosis. Bacterially expressed recombinant neutral SMase 1 hydrolyzed [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin optimally at pH 7.5 in the presence of an Mg2+ ion. In zebrafish embryonic cells, the endogenous SMase enzyme was localized in the microsomal fraction. In FLAG-tagged SMase-overexpressing cells, neutral SMase 1 colocalized with a Golgi marker in a cytochemical analysis. Inactivation of the enzyme by an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide repressed the induction of ceramide generation, caspase-3 activation, and apoptotic cell death by heat stress. Thus, neutral SMase 1 participates in an inducible ceramide-mediating, proapoptotic signaling pathway that operates in heat-induced apoptosis in zebrafish embryonic cells. Neutral sphingomyelinases (SMases) are involved in the induction of ceramide-mediated proapoptotic signaling under heat stress conditions. Although ceramide is an important mediator of apoptosis, the neutral SMase that is activated under heat stress has not been identified. In this study, we cloned an Mg2+-dependent neutral SMase from a zebrafish embryonic cell cDNA library using an Escherichia coli expression-cloning vector. Screening of the clones using an SMase activity assay with C6-7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl-sphingomyelin as the substrate resulted in the isolation of one neutral SMase cDNA clone. This cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 420 amino acids (putative molecular weight: 46,900) containing two predicted transmembrane domains in its C-terminal region. The cloned neutral SMase 1 acted as a mediator of stress-induced apoptosis. Bacterially expressed recombinant neutral SMase 1 hydrolyzed [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin optimally at pH 7.5 in the presence of an Mg2+ ion.

Thus, neutral SMase 1 participates in an inducible ceramide-mediating, proapoptotic signaling pathway that operates in heat-induced apoptosis in zebrafish embryonic cells. Sphingolipids have been implicated as bioactive molecules in animal cells. Specifically, ceramide is a mediator of apoptosis (1Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A.

SMases, especially acidic SMase and neutral SMase, are activated in response to growth factors, cytokines, chemotherapeutic agents, irradiation, nutrient removal, and stress (4Hannun Y.A. Luberto C.

Although a neutral or acidic SMase is thought to mediate stress-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis, the identity of the stress-induced SMase that mediates apoptosis has not been determined. To understand the molecular mechanisms of stress-induced apoptosis and sphingolipid metabolism, the SMase(s) involved must be cloned and biochemically characterized. We have focused on zebrafish embryos and cultured cells as experimental models for the characterization of ceramide-induced apoptosis (30Yabu T. Kishi S. Okazaki T. Yamashita M. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 31Yabu T. Todoriki S. Yamashita M. Fish. Sci. 2001; 67: 333-340Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Yabu T. Tomimoto H. Taguchi Y.

Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44012-44022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, we found a zebrafish Mg2+-dependent neutral SMase 1 that produces ceramide and causes thalidomide-induced vascular defects in zebrafish embryos (32Yabu T. Tomimoto H. Taguchi Y. Yamaoka S. Igarashi Y. Okazaki T. Blood. 2005; 106: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, this enzyme may be the mediator of stress-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis. In our preliminary studies, zebrafish cells showed high Mg2+-dependent neutral SMase activity. Here, we report the expression cloning and biochemical features of this zebrafish neutral SMase 1 as a key enzyme in stress-induced apoptosis and ceramide generation in zebrafish embryonic (ZE) cells. Because the amino acid sequence of the zebrafish enzyme was expected to have very low sequence homology with the known mammalian neutral SMases, we used an Escherichia coli expression cloning strategy with an SMase assay. Biochemical characterization showed that his enzyme is a mediator of stress-inducible apoptosis in ZE cells.

Heat Shock Treatment—ZE cells were grown at 5 × 105 cells/ml in preheated medium in culture dishes, heat-shocked in an incubator at 37 or 38 °C, and then allowed to recover at 28.5 °C. Cell viability was determined using the trypan blue dye exclusion method (32Yabu T. Tomimoto H. Taguchi Y. Yamaoka S. Igarashi Y. Okazaki T. Blood. 2005; 106: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). After cells were heat-shocked at 37 or 38 °C for 0–11 h, they were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phyenylidole (DAPI (7Kondo T.

Cells exhibiting nuclear condensation and fragmentation were judged as apoptotic. Caspase-3 Assay—Caspase-3 activity was measured using a synthetic substrate, Ac-DEVD-MCA, according to the method described previously (30Yabu T. Kishi S. Okazaki T. Yamashita M. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). ZE cells were washed once with PBS and homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol) by passage through a 27-gauge needle. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. A portion of the supernatant was added to 180 μl of a caspase substrate mixture containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 μm Ac-DEVD-MCA and then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The release of 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin was measured using a fluorescent spectrophotometer (Millipore) with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 450 nm. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Ceramide Measurement—Lipids in the cells were extracted by the methods of Bligh and Dyer (36Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), and ceramide mass measurements using E. coli diacylglycerol kinase were according to the method described by Okazaki et al. (3Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solvent system used to separate ceramide 1-phosphate was chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1). To calculate the ceramide content, the positive spots on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates were measured using a Storm® 860 imaging analyzer (GE Healthcare). Sphingomyelin Quantification—After heat shock treatment, 1 × 107 cells were harvested, and the lipids were extracted from the cells by the methods of Bligh and Dyer (36Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and developed using a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, by volume) on a plastic TLC plate with standard sphingomyelin. The spots corresponding to sphingomyelin were scraped, and the lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (36Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Inorganic phosphate in the extract was measured by the ammonium molybdate/ascorbic acid method (37Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol.

Metabolic Labeling of Ceramide with [14C]Serine—The cells were wash with PBS, seeded at 5 × 105/ml in Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 370 MBq/ml l-[U-14C]serine and 2% FCS, and incubated at 28.5 °C for 3 days. The labeled cells were heat-shocked at 38 °C for 1 h and then recovered to incubate at 28.5 °C for 3 h. After harvesting the cells, lipids extracted from the cells by the methods of Bligh and Dyer (36Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) were separated on TLC plates with a solvent system of methyl acetate, propanol-1, chloroform, methanol, and 0.25% KCl (25:25:25: 10:9 by volume). The spots corresponding to ceramide were visualized, and the relative radioactivity was determined by the Storm® 860 analyzer system (GE Healthcare), corrected by the amount of phospholipids in each sample. Serine Palmitoyltransferase Assay—The cells at 5 × 106/ml were homogenized in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA and 1× Complete® Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) by passage through a 27-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1300 × g, and the supernatant was then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g. The pellets resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 30% glycerol were used for the enzyme assay as the microsomal fraction. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Serine palmitoyltransferase activity was determined with the microsomal fractions prepared from both the heat-shocked and the control cells. The microsomal fraction containing 80 μg of protein was incubated in 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8.3, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, 1 mm 14C-labeled l-serine (370 MBq/mmol), and 200 μm palmitoyl CoA in a total volume of 200 μl at 37 °C for 20 min with shaking. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2 by volume). Unlabeled sphinganine (25 μl of a 1 mg/ml ethanol solution) was added as a carrier and extracted by phase separation using 1 ml of chloroform and 2 ml of 0.5 m ammonia. After removal of the aqueous phase, the organic phase was washed twice with 2 ml of water to remove unincorporated radiolabeled serine. The resultant organic phase was dried under nitrogen, and the radioactivity of the produced 3-ketodihydrosphingosine was measured by liquid scintillation counting. SMase Assay—The cells were lysed by passage through a 27-gauge needle in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was used as an enzyme source. Supernatant protein (60 μg) was mixed in a reaction mixture (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm C6-NBD-sphingomyelin, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 900 μl of H2O and 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1 by volume) and then mixed well and centrifuged. The lower organic phase was collected, and the solvent was evaporated. Aliquots were applied to TLC plates. The solvent system used to separate C6-NBD-ceramide and C6-NBD-sphingomyelin was chloroform/methanol/12 mm MgCl2 in water (65:25:4 by volume). C6-NBD-ceramide was visualized by UV irradiation and measured using a TLC scanner with fluorometer (475 nm excitation, 525 nm emission). Expression Cloning of Neutral SMase cDNA from Zebrafish—Total RNA was isolated from zebrafish embryonic cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA using the Oligotex-dt30 mRNA purification kit (Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA using a Superscript Choice system for cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen). A cDNA library was prepared using the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression vector pET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysE cells (Novagen). The library contained 1 × 107 independent clones. Aliquots containing ∼1000 E. coli clones from the library were inoculated in 4 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and grown overnight at 30 °C in a shaker at 200 rpm. The culture was transferred to 4 ml of fresh LB broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the above incubation conditions were continued until turbidity at 600 nm reached 0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the culture was grown for a further 4 h to induce the expression of the transgene product. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation, and neutral SMase activity was assayed. E. coli colonies from the positive pool that had high SMase activity were incubated on LB plates. Each E. coli clone was cultured in 4 ml, and its SMase activity was measured. Finally, a positive cDNA clone encoding neutral SMase from zebrafish was isolated and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the isolated zebrafish neutral SMase cDNA was deposited at the DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL-EBI data bank under accession number AB196165. Transfection of the Neutral SMase 1 cDNA into ZE Cells—The neutral SMase cDNA from zebrafish containing the complete open reading frame was amplified by PCR using the isolated full-length cDNA as the template, sense primer 5′-TCAGGAGCGGACTGAAGCGGCATCATGGCA-3′, and antisense primer 5′-CCGTCGAGTCCTTTCAAACGGGAGGAATAA-3′. The PCR reaction was carried out with 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 63 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The amplified product was subcloned downstream of the human cytomegalovirus promoter of the pTARGET mammalian expression vector (Promega) according to the manufacture's protocol. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. This construct was named pTARGET-ZNSMase. For the neutral SMase assay, ZE cells were cultured at a density of 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish in 5 ml of Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 2% FCS. At ∼90% confluence, each dish of cells was transiently transfected with 5 μg of DNA of pTARGET-ZNSMase vector or mock vector with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and homogenized in lysis buffer for neutral SMase assay. Preparation of Recombinant Neutral SMase—The neutral SMase 1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using sense primer 5′-CATATGGCACCACAGCAGCCCGGCAAACTG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CATATGTTATTCCTCCCGTTTGAAAGGACT-3′, each containing an NdeI site; the amplimer was subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy plasmid vector by the TA cloning method (Promega). The cloned nucleotide sequence was confirmed by sequencing and subcloned into the NdeI site in the multiple cloning site of the pET-16b vector (Novagen) to fuse a His10 tag sequence to the N terminus of the neutral SMase 1 open reading frame. This construct was named pETZNSMase 1. Neutral SMase 1 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysE cells (Novagen) transformed with pETZNSMase 1. The cells were inoculated in 100 ml of LB broth and grown overnight at 30 °C in a shaker at 200 rpm. The culture was transferred to 1000 ml of fresh LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin in a 5-liter flask, and the above incubation conditions were continued until turbidity at 600 nm reached 0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was grown for an additional 4 h to induce the expression of the transgene. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min. The N-terminal His-tagged neutral SMase was purified from the bacterial extract by affinity chromatography with HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The bacterial cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 1× Complete proteinase inhibitor mixture, 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme) by passage through a 22-gauge needle. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected by centrifuging the lysate at 10,000 × g for 30 min and then dialyzed against wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 300 mm sodium chloride, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm imidazole, 0.1% TritonX-100, and 1 mm EDTA). The dialyzed sample was loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated in wash buffer. After sample loading, the column was washed with 100 ml of wash buffer followed by a 0–100% linear gradient of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 300 mm sodium chloride, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 800 mm imidazole, 0.1% TritonX-100, and 1 mm EDTA). The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and 2-ml fractions were collected. The HisTrap HP fractions that had neutral SMase activity were pooled and dialyzed against gel filtration buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA) and then loaded onto a Sephacryl S-100 column (HR 16/60, GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated in gel filtration buffer. The enzyme was eluted at 1 ml/min with 150 ml of gel filtration buffer. Preparation of Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody against Zebrafish Neutral SMase—To generate a polyclonal antibody against zebrafish neutral SMase 1, the purified recombinant protein was used for immunization in the rabbit. Specific IgG was purified from the serum by an affinity chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). SMase Assay of the Recombinant Enzyme—The SMase activity of the recombinant enzyme was determined using radiolabeled substrate in a mixed micelle assay system as described previously (20Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, [14C]sphingomyelin and bovine brain sphingomyelin were placed in a glass tube and dried under nitrogen. The reaction mixture containing Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 nmol of [14C]sphingomyelin (100,000 dpm), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm MgCl2 was prepared by sonication for 5 min. After the addition of 1 μl of enzyme solution to the reaction mixture, the corresponding solution was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 ml water and 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1 by volume). After vortexing and a two-phase separation by centrifugation, 0.2 ml of the upper aqueous phase was removed and added to 2 ml of scintillation solution for radioactivity counting. The reaction was linear with the incubation times up to 3 h. The amount of enzyme added to the reaction mixtures was chosen such that <10% hydrolysis of the substrate occurred. An appropriate blank containing denatured enzyme was run with each reaction and subtracted from the experimental samples. To examine the effect of the magnesium ion on the activity of the purified enzyme, the reaction mixtures were used in the presence or absence of magnesium. For assaying the effects of different pH on the SMase activity, the following buffers were used at final concentration of 100 mm: sodium acetate (pH 4 and 5), PIPES (pH 6 and 7), and Tris (pH 7.5, 8, 8.5, and 9). Hydrolyzing activity against phosphatidylcholine of the purified enzyme was measured with 10 nmol of [14C]phosphatidylcholine (100,000 dpm) instead of sphingomyelin in the mixed micelle solution for the SMase assay. Hydrolyzing activity against lyso-platelet-activating factor was determined using radiolabeled subst"

We discovered that iron regulates the expression of α-hemoglobin-stabilizing protein (AHSP), a molecular chaperone that binds and stabilizes free α-globin during hemoglobin synthesis. In primates, the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of AHSP mRNA contains a nucleotide sequence resembling iron responsive elements (IREs), stem-loop structures that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding iron regulatory proteins (IRPs). The AHSP IRE-like stem-loop deviates from classical consensus sequences and binds IRPs poorly in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. However, in cytoplasmic extracts, AHSP mRNA co-immunoprecipitates with IRPs in a fashion that is dependent on the stem-loop structure and inhibited by iron. Moreover, this interaction enhances AHSP mRNA stability in erythroid and heterologous cells. Our findings demonstrate that IRPs can regulate mRNA expression through non-canonical IREs and extend the repertoire of known iron-regulated genes. In addition, we illustrate a new mechanism through which hemoglobin may be modulated according to iron status.

Free globins, heme synthetic intermediates and iron are all cytotoxic. Accordingly, numerous mechanisms have evolved to coordinate Hb synthesis and limit the damage caused by its individual components. Iron is of particular concern, because it catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that chemically alter proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Under normal circumstances, most circulating iron is bound by transferrin, which is internalized by specific receptors on the plasma membrane of most cells. Iron uptake in erythroid precursors is modulated by availability of transferrin-bound iron, the number of functional transferrin receptors (TFR1) on the cell surface, and in iron-overload states, nontransferrin-bound iron (1.Beutler, E., Hoffbrand, A. V., and Cook, J. D. (2003) Hematology Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program, 40–61Google Scholar). Like most other cells, erythroid precursors regulate iron through the coordinated synthesis of TFR1 and the intracellular iron storage protein ferritin via an iron sensor system consisting of iron responsive elements (IRE) and iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) (reviewed in Refs. 2.Rouault T.A.

Acta. 2006; 1763: 668-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Iron responsive elements are present in mRNA UTRs and form stem-loop structures that are recognized by iron-sensing IRPs. Increased iron and/or heme levels regulate IRP activities. Insertion of an [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster into IRP1 inhibits its RNA binding activity and converts the protein to the cytosolic aconitase (5.Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Kennedy M.C.

Binding of IRPs to 5′-UTR IREs inhibits mRNA translation while IRP/IRE interactions within the 3′-UTR enhance transcript stability by protecting from endonuclease degradation (11.Haile D.J. Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 5055-5061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stability of TFR1 mRNA is regulated by multiple IREs within the 3′-UTR(12.Casey J.L. Hentze M.W. Koeller D.M. Caughman S.W. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Science. 1988; 240: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 13.Mullner E.W. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In contrast, CDC14A and SLC11A2/DMT1 mRNAs contain single functional IREs within their 3′-UTRs (14.Gunshin H. Allerson C.R. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Rofts A. Rogers J.T. Kishi F. Hentze M.W.

Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22865-22874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition to utilizing the generalized IRE system, erythroid cells contain mechanisms that link globin synthesis to iron availability. For example, iron promotes globin production by regulating activity of the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase, HRI, which inactivates the general translation initiation factor elF2 (16.Chen J.J. Blood. 2007; 109: 2693-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Heme, which is produced when iron is replete, binds and inactivates HRI, enhancing globin translation. Iron deficiency depletes heme, thereby activating HRI to inhibit globin protein synthesis. Iron also regulates globin gene transcription via the nuclear heme-binding protein, Bach1. In the absence of heme, for example during iron deficiency, Bach 1 binds cis elements within α-globin, β-globin, and other genes to repress transcription (17.Igarashi K. Sun J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Binding of heme to Bach1 induces its release from DNA and proteolytic degradation, thereby promoting globin transcription (18.Tahara T. Sun J. Igarashi K. Taketani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19.Tahara T. Sun J. Nakanishi K. Yamamoto M. Mori H. Saito T. Fujita H. Igarashi K. Taketani S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5480-5487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, Bach1 and HRI sense intracellular iron (via heme) and adjust globin synthesis appropriately to minimize the accumulation of free subunits. α-Hemoglobin-stabilizing protein (AHSP) is an abundant erythroid protein that binds and stabilizes multiple forms of free α-globin (20.Gell D. Kong Y. Eaton S.A. Weiss M.J. Mackay J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40602-40609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21.Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For example, AHSP binds “apo” α-globin before heme insertion to stabilize folding of the nascent polypeptide (22.Yu X. Kong Y. Dore L.C. Abdulmalik O. Katein A.M. Zhou S. Choi J.K. Gell D. Mackay J.P. Gow A.J. Weiss M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 1856-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, AHSP binds heme-associated “holo” α-globin (αHb) and converts it into a more stable form, which inhibits the ability of heme iron to catalyze ROS production (23.Feng L. Gell D.A. Zhou S. Gu L. Kong Y. Li J. Hu M. Yan N. Lee C. Rich A.M. Armstrong R.S. Lay P.A. Gow A.J. Weiss M.J. Mackay J.P. Shi Y.

Nature. 2005; 435: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this fashion, AHSP may limit the toxicity of excess αHb that accumulates at low levels during normal erythropoiesis and to a greater extent in certain hemoglobinopathies, such as β-thalassemia. Ahsp gene knock-out mice produce short-lived erythrocytes with Hb precipitates, indicating an important role in normal erythropoiesis (25.Kong Y. Zhou S. Kihm A.J. Katein A.M. Yu X. Gell D.A. Mackay J.P. Adachi K. Foster-Brown L. Louden C.S. Gow A.J. Weiss M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, loss of AHSP exacerbates β-thalassemia in mice, and quantitative variations in AHSP expression may influence the phenotypes of some forms of human β-thalassemia (25.Kong Y. Zhou S. Kihm A.J. Katein A.M. Yu X. Gell D.A. Mackay J.P. Adachi K. Foster-Brown L. Louden C.S. Gow A.J. Weiss M.J. J. Clin.

Haematol. 2006; 133: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Given the important functions of AHSP in normal erythropoiesis and its potential role as a quantitative trait modifier of β-thalassemia, it is important to define the mechanisms that govern AHSP gene expression. Previous studies demonstrated that the erythroid nuclear proteins GATA-1 and EKLF, and the more generalized factor Oct-1, positively regulate AHSP transcription (27.Pilon A.M. Nilson D.G. Zhou D.

Blood. 2006; 107: 3359-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the current study, we identified a predicted stem-loop structure in the 3′-UTR of AHSP mRNA. This structure resembles an IRE, although it deviates significantly from canonical sequences. In RNA gel shift experiments this IRE-like sequence binds IRPs poorly compared with the classical FTH1 IRE. However, additional studies demonstrate that the AHSP mRNA stem-loop associates with IRPs in cells and modulates iron concentration-dependent mRNA stability. These findings extend the range of functional IRE-like structures that do not conform to previously defined IRE consensus sequences. In addition, they illustrate a new mechanism that links hemoglobin metabolism to cellular iron status. Plasmids and Cloning Strategy—Full-length human AHSP cDNA was PCR-amplified using the following primer set: AHSP-Forward: 5′-ACAGAGAGATTCACGCACC-3′ and AHSP-Reverse1: 5′-CAACAAAACCAGCAGTGGTCTTTATTGAGG-3′. To generate the AHSP stem-loop mutant cDNA (AHSPmut), a second reverse primer was used: AHSP-Reverse2: 5′-CAACAAAACCAGCAGTGGTACTCATTGAGG-3′. The three mutated nucleotides are underlined. PCR conditions were: 95 °C x 3 min; 94 °C × 30 s, 58 °C × 40 s, 72 °C × 1 min for 30 cycles; 72 °C × 4 min. Full-length cDNAs were cloned into pEF1-αNEO or p-TET plasmids (Invitrogen). All wild-type (wt) and mutant AHSP cDNAs generated by PCR were sequenced. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The K562 human erythroleukemia cell line was cultured in IMDM with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa/tTA cells (31.Kong J. Ji X. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1125-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa IRP knockdown (KD) cells were grown with puromycin and G418 (32.Wang W. Di X. D'Agostino Jr., R.B. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24650-24659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To induce erythroid maturation, K562 cells were treated with 80 μm hydroxyurea (Sigma) for 48 h. Cells were treated with either 1 mm ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) or 50 μm hemin (hem) as iron sources. Desferrioxamine (DFO, 100 μm) was used as an iron chelator. Cell transfection was performed with FuGENE (Roche Applied Sciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 and HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of AHSPwt pEF1-αNEO or AHSPmut pEF1-αNEO and analyzed after 48 h. HeLa/tTA cells, used for experiments in Fig. 2, were transfected with 2 μg of AHSPwt pTET or AHSPmut pTET and analyzed after 24 h. These experiments were performed in the absence of tetracycline to allow for full cDNA expression in this “tet-off” system. Bioinformatics—We used RNAProfile to search for predicted stem-loops within AHSP mRNAs (33.Pavesi G. Mauri G. Stefani M. Pesole G. Nucleic Acid Res. 2004; 32: 3258-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Multispecies comparison of AHSP cDNAs was performed using The UCSC Genome Browser (34.Miller W. Rosenbloom K.

RNA secondary structures were evaluated further using RNAfold and mfold (35.Zuker M. Stiegler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar). RNA Immunoprecipitation (IP)—Isolation of IRP-RNA complexes was performed as described with minor modifications (36.Waggoner S.A. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7055-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A detailed protocol is included in supplemental methods. Anti-IRP1 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-IRP2 antibody was provided by Tracey Rouault (37.Meyron-Holtz E.G. Ghosh M.C. Iwai K. LaVaute T. Brazzolotto X. Berger U.V. Land W. Ollivierre-Wilson H. Grinberg A. Love P. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). RNA-labeled Probe Synthesis—Radiolabeled IRE and control probes were prepared by in vitro transcription from oligonucleotide templates using T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) (38.Allerson C.R. Cazzola M. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26439-26447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Templates consisted of a “bottom strand” oligomer containing the 17-nucleotide T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence fused to IRE sequences. This was hybridized to a 17-nucleotide “top strand” that is complementary to the T7 promoter sequence represented in the bottom strand (supplemental Table S1). For competition assays, FPLC-purified RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT (supplemental Table S1). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Purified IRPs were prepared as described (39.Brown N.M. Anderson S.A. Steffen D.W. Carpenter T.B. Kennedy M.C. Walden W.E. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl.

[32P]UTP-radiolabeled IRE probes (1 nm) were mixed with either 100 ng of liver cytoplasmic extract or different molar ratios of purified IRP1 or IRP2 and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Heparin (3 mg/ml) was added, and the samples analyzed on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel as described (41.Barton H.A. Eisenstein R.S. Bomford A. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7000-7008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Messenger RNA Stability Assay—Actinomycin D, 5 μm, (Sigma) was added to the culture medium to inhibit transcription. Cells were collect at various time points, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The relative levels of AHSP and control mRNAs were determined by real time RT-PCR. RNA Isolation and Gene Expression Analysis—Total RNA was purified by homogenizing cells in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of RNA were isolated as described (42.Feng Y.Q. Warin R. Li T. Olivier E. Besse A. Lobell A. Fu H. Lin C.M. Aladjem M.I. Bouhassira E.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3864-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ten million cells were incubated in 3 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation (200 × g for 5 min). The supernatant was collected as cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclear pellets were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent. RNA samples were treated with 1 unit of RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C before cDNA synthesis. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated using 2 μg of total RNA, oligo dT18, and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Gene expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR (Thermocycle 7900, Applied Biosystems) using SYBR green reagent (Invitrogen) and mRNA-specific primers (supplemental Table S2). Primers were designed for standard real-time PCR using PrimerExpress (Applied Biosystems). Identification of a Putative Stem-Loop Structure in the 3′-UTR of AHSP mRNA—Iron regulates the expression of numerous genes via IRE stem-loop structures present in the UTRs of mRNA. We investigated whether AHSP mRNA might be subject to this mode of regulation by using the program RNAProfile to search for segments of the UTRs of human AHSP mRNA that have the potential to form stem-loops. A prominent potential stem-loop (ΔG = –9.50 kcal/mol) is found at the 3′-end of the mRNA, with the polyadenylation signal as part of the predicted stem (Fig. 1). A similar predicted stem-loop structure is found in the homologous sequences of other simian primates, including the rhesus macaque, an Old World monkey, and marmoset, a New World monkey. This stem-loop structure has several features in common with canonical IREs, including a 5-bp upper stem separated from a lower stem of variable length by an unpaired nucleotide in a bulge (43.Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Bonnard C. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17481-17489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Butt J. Kim H.Y. Basilion J.P. Cohen S. Iwai K. Philpott C.C. Altschul S.

The apical loop of most IREs has the consensus sequence CAGUGH (where H is A, C, or U), with the C forming a base pair with the second G to generate an AGU pseudotriloop structure that is recognized by IRP1 (46.Walden W.E.

The sequence of human AHSP mRNA has a matching sequence, CAGUGC. However, the predicted stem-loop structure for human AHSP mRNA differs in several aspects from canonical IREs. One predicted structure has the CA in the CAGUGC loop consensus motif involved in base pairing in the upper stem (Fig. 1C, structure 1). In an alternate conformation, the AGU is exposed and anchored by a G-C intraloop pair (structure 2 in Fig. 1C), but this secondary structure is expected to be less stable. The preferred nucleotide in the bulge is C in all known natural IREs, whereas the predicted structures for AHSP mRNA have an A. The A nucleotide in the bulge is part of the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal. Numerous studies have identified RNAs with non-canonical sequences that bind IRPs (44.Butt J. Kim H.Y. Basilion J.P.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We investigated further the functional properties of the IRE-like stem-loop element present in AHSP mRNA. We discovered that this stem-loop associates with IRE-binding proteins and modulates mRNA stability in an iron-dependent fashion. Therefore, we refer to this structure as an IRE-like stem-loop because it shares some properties with classical IREs but also exhibits significant differences in sequence, predicted secondary structure and some functional features. An AHSP IRE-like stem-loop is not apparent in mammals outside the clade of simian primates. As expected, the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal is conserved among all mammals including the marsupial opossum, but the sequences homologous to the apical loop and the 3′-part of the stem show many differences outside simian primates (Fig. 1B). Many of these sequences are predicted to form stem-loops, but they differ from those expected for IREs in the length of the stems, the presence of a bulge 5 bp away from the loop, and the sequence of the loop. Thus, the phylogenetic comparisons indicate that this IRE-like structure is primate-specific. It may be an adaptation in primates to provide an additional mechanism for iron-mediated regulation of AHSP. The AHSP IRE-like Stem-Loop Associates with IRPs in Cells—We used RNA co-immunoprecipitation to study human AHSP mRNA binding to IRP1 and IRP2, the two major known IRE-binding proteins (54.Sanchez M. Galy B. Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We introduced a full-length wt AHSP cDNA expression construct into HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated IRP1 and IRP2 complexes from cytosolic extracts. Co-immunoprecipitated RNAs were quantified by real-time RT-PCR and normalized to the same mRNA present in extracts prior to immunoprecipitation (input sample). Ectopically expressed AHSPwt mRNA was enriched significantly by immunoprecipitation with IRP1 or IRP2 antibodies, but not control IgG (Fig. 2A). Identical results were obtained using two independent sets of PCR primers derived from different regions of AHSP cDNA (data not shown). FTH1 mRNA examined as a positive control also co-immunoprecipitated specifically with IRP1 and IRP2 (Fig. 2A). Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA, which does not contain an IRE, was not enriched by IRP immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A). Endogenous AHSP mRNA was also enriched in IRP1 and IRP2 complexes immunoprecipitated from cytosolic extracts of K562 erythroleukemia cells (Fig. 2B). Together, these data suggest that AHSP mRNA associates with IRP1 and IRP2 in cells. To determine if the AHSP mRNA-IRP interaction is mediated by the IRE-like stem-loop, we generated AHSPmut cDNA, which contains three mutations that disrupt the structure (Fig. 2C). This mutant cDNA was expressed normally in HeLa cells (not shown), but failed to bind IRPs 1 and 2 (Fig. 2A). Hence, AHSP mRNA associates with IRPs 1 and 2 via the IRE-like stem-loop present in the 3′-UTR. We also investigated the effects of iron on AHSP mRNA binding affinity to IRPs. IRP1 and IRP2 complexes were immunoprecipitated from AHSPwt mRNA-expressing HeLa cells treated with either ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) as a source of iron or desferrioxamine (DFO), an iron chelator (Fig. 2D). Treatment with DFO moderately enhanced co-immunoprecipitation between IRP2 and AHSP mRNA (p < 0.05). In contrast, FAC treatment markedly inhibited co-immunoprecipitation of AHSP mRNA with both IRPs 1 and 2 (Fig. 2D), without impairing cell viability (not shown). Overall, our data indicate that in cells, the AHSP mRNA IRE-like stem-loop associates with IRPs in an iron-regulated fashion, consistent with classical IRE/IRP interactions described for other transcripts, including FTH1, TFR1, and ALAS2 (46.Walden W.E.

The AHSP IRE-like Stem-Loop Binds Poorly to IRPs in Vitro—We performed RNA EMSAs to further study AHSP IRE-like stem-loop-IRP interactions (Fig. 3). A [32P]UTP-labeled RNA oligonucleotide representing the IRE-like structure from human AHSP mRNA was incubated with several concentrations of purified IRP1 and IRP2 and RNA-protein interactions examined by non-denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis (Fig. 3A). Human FTH1 IRE probe was used as a positive control for binding to IRPs. Upon incubation with the FTH1 IRE probe (1 nm), both recombinant IRP1 (1 nm) and IRP2 (1 nm) showed prominent band-shifts, indicating the formation of RNA:protein complexes (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the AHSP IRE-like stem-loop probe exhibited very weak IRP binding activity. Formation of RNA-IRP1 complex was visualized only at RNA/protein ratios of 1:5 and 1:10 (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6). No band shift was visualized at any concentration of IRP2 (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–9). Next, we performed gel shift competition assays. Liver cell extracts (as a source for IRP1 and IRP2) were incubated with [32P]UTP-labeled FTH1 IRE probe and various unlabeled competitor RNAs, then formation of RNA-protein complexes was evaluated by EMSA (Fig. 3B).

The neural excitotoxicity induced by ionotropic glutamate receptors gain the upper hand during ischemia-reperfusion. In this paper, we investigate whether GluR5 (glutamate receptor 5)-containing kainate receptor activation could lead to a neuroprotective effect against ischemic brain injury and the related mechanism. The results showed that (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid (ATPA), a selective GluR5 agonist, could suppress Src tyrosine phosphorylation and interactions among N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), and Src and then decrease NMDA receptor activation through attenuating tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B. More importantly, ATPA had a neuroprotective effect against ischemia-reperfusion-induced neuronal cell death in vivo. However, four separate drugs were found to abolish the effects of ATPA. These were selective GluR5 antagonist NS3763; GluR5 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; CdCl2, a broad spectrum blocker of voltage-gated calcium channels; and bicuculline, an antagonist of γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor. GABAA receptor agonist muscimol could attenuate Src activation and interactions among NR2A, PSD-95 and Src, resulting the suppression of NMDA receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, patch clamp recording proved that the activated GABAA receptor could inhibit NMDA receptor-mediated whole-cell currents. Taken together, the results suggest that during ischemia-reperfusion, activated GluR5 may facilitate Ca2+-dependent GABA release from interneurons. The released GABA can activate postsynaptic GABAA receptors, which then attenuates NMDA receptor tyrosine phosphorylation through inhibiting Src activation and disassembling the signaling module NR2A-PSD-95-Src. The final result of this process is that the pyramidal neurons are rescued from hyperexcitability.

The final result of this process is that the pyramidal neurons are rescued from hyperexcitability. Brain functions are based on the dynamic balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Cerebral ischemia breaks this balance, and the neural excitotoxicity takes over, which induces delayed neuronal cell death. Glutamate, as the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, has been given widespread attention in previous studies. Ionotropic glutamate receptors, which play an important part in ischemic excitotoxicity, are divided into N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), 3The abbreviations and trivial name used are: NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate; AS-ODNs, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; ATPA, (RS)-2-Amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; KA receptor, kainate receptor; Mus, muscimol; p-Src, phospho-Src; NS3763, 4,6-bis(benzoylamino)-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid. α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA), and kainate (KA) receptors (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3662) Google Scholar, 2Seeburg P.H. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The NMDA receptor, as a type of ligand-gated ion channel, attracts the most attention in research of cerebral ischemia. It is composed of three types of subunits: NR1, NR2 (NR2A to -D), and NR3 (NR3A and -B) (3Andersson O. Stenqvist A. Attersand A. von Euler G. Genomics. 2001; 78: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Chatterton J.E. Awobuluyi M. Premkumar L.S. Takahashi H. Talantova M. Shin Y. Cui J. Tu S. Sevarino K.A. Nakanishi N. Tong G.

Among these subunits, transient global ischemia increases tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B (6Takagi N. Shinno K. Teves L. Bissoon N. Wallace M.C. Gurd J.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1060-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). During ischemia-reperfusion, excessive glutamate release induces the influx of Na+ and Ca2+ ions through NMDA receptors (7Lee J.M. Zipfel G.J. Choi D.W. Nature. 1999; 399: A7-A14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar), and activated Src kinase can mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B (8Ali D.W. Salter M.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and increase the activity of NMDA receptors (9Yu X.M. Askalan R. Keil II, G.J. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Our previous study suggested that cerebral ischemia induced autophosphorylation of Src, and then the activated Src could phosphorylate NMDA receptors in pyramidal neurons. PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein 95) was involved in the event through forming signaling module NR2A-PSD-95-Src (10Hou X.Y. Zhang G.Y. Zong Y.Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 343: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Zhang G. Gao C. Hou X. Brain Res. 2001; 909: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast to NMDA receptors, little is known about the role of KA receptors in ischemia-reperfusion. KA receptors are composed of five subunits: GluR5, GluR6, GluR7, KA1, and KA2 (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3662) Google Scholar). A number of interesting experimental results turned our attention to the GluR5 and GluR6 subunits; GluR6-deficient mice exhibited resistance to neurotoxic effects induced by kainate (12Mulle C. Sailer A. Perez-Otano I. Dickinson-Anson H. Castillo P.E. Bureau I. Maron C. Gage F.H. Mann J.R. Bettler B. Heinemann S.F. Nature. 1998; 392: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Knock-out of GluR6 prevented kainate-induced epileptiform bursts, whereas ablation of GluR5 led to a higher susceptibility of epileptogenic effects of kainate (13Fisahn A. Contractor A. Traub R.D. Buhl E.H. Heinemann S.F. McBain C.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9658-9668Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). An agonist of GluR5-containing KA receptors had antiepileptic effects (14Khalilov I. Hirsch J. Cossart R. Ben-Ari Y. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results suggest that GluR6 and GluR5 may play opposing roles in brain excitability. Recently, we found that GluR6-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation is responsible for ischemic brain injury (15Pei D.S. Wang X.T. Liu Y. Sun Y.F. Guan Q.H. Wang W. Yan J.Z. Zong Y.Y. Xu T.L. Zhang G.Y. Brain. 2006; 129: 465-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We want to know whether GluR5 also plays opposing roles to GluR6 in cerebral ischemia and, if so, to identify the related mechanism. Corresponding to their distinct functions, GluR6 and GluR5 have different distribution in the hippocampus. The excitatory pyramidal cells express primarily GluR6, whereas GluR5 is expressed primarily within the inhibitory interneurons of the hippocampus (16Bahn S. Volk B. Wisden W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5525-5547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bureau I. Bischoff S. Heinemann S.F. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 653-663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with excitatory glutamate neurotransmission, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), as the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in central nervous system, has received relatively little attention in the area of ischemic brain injury (18Schwartz-Bloom R.D. Sah R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 353-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (also called local circuit neurons) of hippocampus are the regulators of pyramidal neuron excitability (19Freund T.F. Buzsaki G. Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 347-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), keeping the dynamic balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Recent studies have shown that activation of GluR5-containing KA receptors facilitates GABA release from interneurons and increases tonic inhibition of pyramidal neurons (17Bureau I. Bischoff S. Heinemann S.F. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 653-663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Christensen J.K. Paternain A.V. Selak S. Ahring P.K. Lerma J. J.

Neuron. 2001; 30: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, GABA performs a function through acting on the GABA receptors, which can be divided into three subclasses: GABAA, GABAB, and GABAC receptors (23Bormann J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Among them, GABAA receptor, which directly controls a chloride ion channel, is situated in the postsynaptic membrane. Activation of GABAA receptors enhances the influx of chloride ions, inducing hyperpolarization and attenuating cell excitability (24Oja S.S. Korpi E.R. Saransaari P. Neurochem. Res. 1990; 15: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In cerebral ischemia research, it was reported that GABAA receptors also take part in neuroprotection against ischemia-reperfusion (25Lyden P.D. Hedges B. Stroke. 1992; 23 (Discussion 1469-1470): 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26Lyden P.D. Lonzo L. Stroke. 1994; 25: 189-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shuaib A. Mazagri R. Ijaz S. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 123: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Taken together, there is a raised possibility that activation of GluR5-containing KA receptors facilitates GABA release from interneurons. The released GABA activates postsynaptic GABAA receptors, which suppress the ischemic depolarization and then decrease the activation of NMDA receptors, performing a neuroprotective function against ischemic brain injury through enhancing inhibitory inputs and then getting excitation and inhibition back into the proper dynamic balance. In the present study, we used (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid (ATPA), a selective agonist of GluR5-containing KA receptors (28Clarke V.R. Ballyk B.A. Hoo K.H.

Nature. 1997; 389: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), to investigate whether activated GluR5-containing KA receptors exert neuroprotection on pyramidal neurons through suppressing Src activation and interactions among PSD-95, Src, and NR2A and then decreasing NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity during ischemia-reperfusion. Materials—Anti-PSD-95, anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Src, anti-NR2A, anti-NR2B, anti-phospho-Src (anti-p-Src, Tyr-416; for immunohistochemistry use) antibodies were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Anti-p-Src (Tyr-416) antibody and bicuculline were obtained from BIOMOL (Butler Pike, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-actin antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). ATPA and NS3763 were purchased from TOCRIS Bioscience (Bristol, UK). 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). All other chemicals were got from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Drug Administration—The rats were injected intraperitoneally with bicuculline (2 mg/kg) or muscimol (Mus; 1 mg/kg) in 0.9% NaCl 30 min before ischemia. Animals were given ATPA, NS3763, or CdCl2 by means of unilateral intracerebroventricular infusion (anteroposterior, 0.8 mm; lateral, 1.5 mm; depth, 3.5 mm from the bregma). ATPA (2 nmol in 5 μl of 0.9% NaCl) was administered to the rats 20 min before ischemia. Either NS3763 (3 nmol in 5 μl of DMSO) or CdCl2 (10 nmol in 5 μl of H2O) was injected 30 min before ischemia. 10 nmol of end-phosphorothioated GluR5 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) in 10 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA) were given to the rats every 24 h for 3 days. The same dose of missense (MS) or vehicle (TE buffer) was used as a control. The sequences for GluR5 AS-ODNs were 5′-GCTTCTTAATTCATGCCGAA-3′, and sequences for MS-ODNs were 5′-GCTTCTAATTTCATGCCGAA-3′. Animal Model of Ischemia—Adult male SD rats weighing 250-300 g were used (Shanghai Experimental Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Science). The experimental procedures were approved by local legislation for ethics of experiments on animals. Transient cerebral ischemia was induced by four-vessel occlusion, as described previously (29Pulsinelli W.A. Brierley J.B. Stroke. 1979; 10: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). Briefly, under anesthesia with chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), vertebral arteries were electrocauterized, and common carotid arteries were exposed. On the following day, both carotid arteries were occluded with aneurysm clips to induce cerebral ischemia. After 15 min of occlusion, the aneurysm clips were removed for reperfusion. Rectal temperature was maintained at about 37 °C throughout the procedure. Rats that lost their righting reflex and whose pupils were dilated and unresponsive to light were selected for the experiments. Rats with seizures were discarded. An electroencephalography was monitored to ensure isoelectricity after carotid artery occlusion. Sham controls were performed using the same surgical procedures, except that the carotid arteries were not occluded. Sample Preparation—Rats were decapitated immediately after 6 h of reperfusion, and then the hippocampal CA1 region was isolated and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were homogenized in an ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 320 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-phosphoglycerol, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A. The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were stored at -80 °C and were thawed only once just before use. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Tissue homogenates (400 μg of protein) were diluted 4-fold with 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P40 (Nonidet P-40), and 1 mm each of EDTA, EGTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Na3VO4. Samples were preincubated for 1 h with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C and then centrifuged to remove protein adhered nonspecifically to protein A. The supernatants were incubated with primary antibodies for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. Protein A (20 μl) was added to the tube, and incubation was continued for another 2 h. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer. Bound protein was eluted by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then isolated by centrifugation. The supernatants were separated on polyacrylamide gels and then electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After blocking for 3 h in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 3% bovine serum albumin, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in TBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were then washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies in TBST for 2 h and developed using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate color substrate. The densities of the bands on the membrane were scanned and analyzed with an image analyzer (LabWorks Software; UVP, Upland, CA). Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Rats were perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) under anesthesia after 5 days of brain ischemia-reperfusion. Brains were removed quickly and further fixed with the same fixation solution at 4 °C overnight. Postfixed brains were embedded in paraffin, followed by preparation of coronal sections, 5 μm thick, using a microtome (Leica RM2155; Nussloch, Germany). The paraffin-embedded brain sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated by ethanol at graded concentrations of 100-70% (v/v), followed by washing with water. The sections were stained with 0.1% (w/v) cresyl violet and examined using light microscopy. The number of surviving hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells per 1 mm of length was counted as the neuronal density. Immunoreactivity was determined by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated by ethanol at graded concentrations and distilled water. High temperature antigen retrieval was performed in 1 mm citrate buffer. To block endogenous peroxidase activity, sections were incubated for 30 min in a solution of 0.1% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline. After being blocked with 5% (v/v) normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C, sections were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody against phospho-Src (Tyr(P)-416) at 4 °C for 3 days. These sections were then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody made up of 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline overnight and subsequently incubated with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, sections were incubated with the peroxidase substrate diaminobenzidine until the desired stain intensity developed. They were then examined by light microscopy. Cell Culture—Hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from 18-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos as described previously (31Jiang Q. Gu Z. Zhang G. Jing G. Brain Res. 2000; 857: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi were meticulously isolated in ice-cold high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Hippocampal cells were dissociated by trypsinization (0.25% (w/v) trypsin and 0.02% (w/v) EDTA in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution), at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by gentle swing in plating medium (high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum; Invitrogen). Cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated wells or coverslips at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 24 h, cultural medium was replaced by neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mm glutamine and then half-replaced twice every week. Cultures were used after 14 days in vitro for patch clamp recording. Patch Clamp Recording—Electrophysiological recording was performed in the conventional whole-cell patch clamp recording configuration under voltage-clamp conditions. Patch pipettes were pulled from glass capillaries with an outer diameter of 1.5 mm on a two-stage puller (PP-830; Narishige). The resistance between the recording electrode filled with pipette solution (140 mm CsCl, 10 mm tetraethylammonium, 10 mm Hepes, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, pH 7.2), and the reference electrode was 3-5 megaohms. Membrane currents were measured using a patch clamp amplifier AxonPatch 700B (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 1 kHz, sampled, and analyzed using a DigiData 1322A interface and a computer with the pClamp 9.0 system (Axon Instruments). The series resistance was compensated automatically. The membrane potential was held at -60 mV throughout the experiment. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22-25 °C). Statistical Evaluation—Values were expressed as mean ± S.D. and were obtained from no fewer than five independent rats. Statistical analysis of the results was carried out by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Duncan's new multiple range method or the Newman-Keuls test. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. ATPA Attenuates Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B in the Hippocampal CA1 Region—Our previous study showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B and interactions between Src and NMDA receptors reach their peak level at 6 h of reperfusion after ischemia (11Liu Y. Zhang G. Gao C. Hou X. Brain Res. 2001; 909: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Pei L. Li Y. Zhang G.Y. Cui Z.C. Zhu Z.M. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2000; 21: 695-700PubMed Google Scholar). In order to investigate the effects of ATPA on tyrosine phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B, we injected ATPA to rats before ischemia and got samples at 6 h of reperfusion after ischemia. Antibody to NR2B phosphorylated on Tyr-1472 was used, because NR2B Tyr-1472 is the major phosphorylation site mediated by Src family kinases (33Nakazawa T. Komai S. Tezuka T. Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Semba K. Mishina M. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Since Src is activated by autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues (Tyr-416) (34Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we used antibody against Tyr(P)-416 of Src to investigate Src activation. The samples were immunoprecipitated with antibody against NR2A and then immunoblotted with antibody against phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 1, A-D, for ATPA-treatment group, there was a large decline in the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B but not for vehicle of ATPA, whereas the protein level of Src, NR2A, and NR2B did not change significantly. Among the results, two bands were detected in immunoblots with anti-p-Src or anti-Src antibody. To further confirm that ATPA performs a function through activating GluR5, we administered selective GluR5 antagonist NS3763 or GluR5 AS-ODNs, which can suppress the expression of GluR5, to rats combined with ATPA before ischemia. As shown in Fig. 1, A-D, for the ATPA + NS3763 and ATPA + GluR5 AS-ODNs treatment groups, we found that NS3763 and GluR5 AS-ODNs could reverse the effects of ATPA on the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and NMDA receptor, whereas GluR5 MS-ODNs and the vehicles of the above drugs had no significant effects on the phosphorylation states. However, when only NS3763 was administered before ischemia, although the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and NMDA receptor and the interactions among Src, PSD-95, and NR2A increased slightly, the change was not statistically significant (Fig. 1, E-H). Taken together, our results suggest that activated GluR5-containing KA receptor can down-regulate ischemia-induced Src activation and then attenuate the NMDA receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. CdCl2 Suppresses the Inhibitory Effect of ATPA on Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B in the Hippocampal CA1 Region—To further examine whether the voltage-gated calcium channels play a role in the decreased phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B in pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1 region induced by ATPA, we administered CdCl2, a broad spectrum blocker of voltage-gated calcium channels, to rats 30 min before ischemia. As shown in Fig. 2, for the ATPA + CdCl2 treatment group, CdCl2 could abolish the effect of ATPA on tyrosine phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B. We also only injected CdCl2 into the rats before ischemia and then found that it had no significant effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B (data not shown). Thus, our results suggest that the voltage-gated calcium channel is involved in the effect of activated GluR5-containing KA receptor on tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and the NMDA receptor. The GABAA Receptor Is Involved in the Effect of ATPA on Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B in the Hippocampal CA1 Region—It was reported that GluR5-containing KA receptors facilitate GABA release from interneurons and increase tonic inhibition of pyramidal neurons (17Bureau I. Bischoff S. Heinemann S.F. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 653-663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Christensen J.K. Paternain A.V. Selak S. Ahring P.K. Lerma J. J.

Neuron. 2001; 30: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that if released GABA, which was induced by activated GluR5-containing KA receptor, could affect tyrosine phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B in postsynaptic pyramidal neurons, GABAA receptors on postsynaptic cells should be involved in the process. So we injected a GABAA receptor agonist Mus to rats before ischemia to see whether activated GABAA receptors can attenuate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B. The results confirmed the hypothesis (Fig. 3, A and B). The results suggest that the effects of activated GluR5-containing KA receptors on postsynaptic neurons may be mediated by GABAA receptors. To further confirm this, bicuculline, an antagonist of the GABAA receptors, combined with ATPA was administered to the rats 30 min before ischemia. The effect of ATPA on tyrosine phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B was abolished by bicuculline (Fig. 3, C and D). Similar to the other drugs we used, single injection of bicuculline was also conducted before ischemia, and no significant change of tyrosine phosphorylation of Src, NR2A, and NR2B was found (data not shown). In summary, our results suggest that the effect of activated GluR5-containing KA receptor on tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and NMDA receptor is based on GABAA receptor activation. GABAA Receptor Activation Can Significantly Inhibit the NMDA Receptor-mediated Whole-cell Currents—To further investigate the role of GABAA receptors on the effects of ATPA in transient cerebral ischemia, patch clamp recording was used to detect the NMDA receptor-mediated whole-cell currents (INMDA) and the effects of GABAA receptor activator Mus on INMDA. GABAA receptor activation mediated by Mus induced an intracellular current, and co-application of Mus with NMDA evoked the current with an amplitude (83.6 ± 3.3%) that was significantly lower than the expected sum of currents evoked by Mus (IMus) and NMDA (INMDA) independently. The results suggested that there was a cross-inhibition between GABAA receptors and NMDA receptors (Fig. 4A, B and C). Moreover, GABAA receptor activator application was followed by NMDA application to further investigate the relationship between GABAA receptors and NMDA receptors (Fig. 4, D and E). Following a single application of the Mus, INMDA (66.8% ± 3.1%) became much less than the control INMDA. ATPA Disturbs Interactions among PSD-95, Src, and NR2A after Ischemia, and GABAA Receptors Are Involved in the Process—Our previous studies showed that the interaction between Src and NMDA receptors reaches its peak level at 6 h of reperfusion after ischemia (11Liu Y. Zhang G. Gao C. Hou X. Brain Res. 2001; 909: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and PSD-95 is involved in the events (10Hou X.Y. Zhang G.Y. Zong Y.Y. Neurosci.

To assess the mechanism of unfolding of precursor proteins by mtHsp70, we designed a system to measure step sizes of the mtHsp70 import motor, which are distances at which the motor system moves along polypeptide chains during a single turnover of ATP. We made a series of fusion proteins consisting of a mitochondrial presequence containing the first mtHsp70 binding site, a spacer sequence containing an Hsp70 avoidance segment followed by the second mtHsp70 binding site, and different folded mature domains. Analyses of the dependence of the import rates of those fusion proteins on the lengths of Hsp70 avoidance segments allowed us to estimate the step sizes, which differ for different mature domains and different lengths of the spacers. These results suggest that the mtHsp70 import motor functions at least as a molecular Brownian ratchet to unfold mitochondrial precursor proteins.

These results suggest that the mtHsp70 import motor functions at least as a molecular Brownian ratchet to unfold mitochondrial precursor proteins. Protein molecular motors constitute essential cellular devices that convert the chemical energy such as ATP hydrolysis into movement and/or force to perform mechanical works in biological systems (1.Astumian R.D.

Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). Several organellar Hsp70s function as import motors to drive vectorial transmembrane movement and/or concomitant unfolding of substrate precursor proteins through import channels (4.Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). For secretary proteins, substrate trapping by Hsp70 or even antibodies in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen was shown to be sufficient to drive translocation of unfolded substrate proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (5.Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T. Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many folded proteins with a presequence can be imported into mitochondria in a post-translational manner, which requires unfolding of the folded protein domains by mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70) inside the organelles. However, the mechanism of active client protein unfolding by mtHsp70 has been a matter of longstanding debate (6.Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 7.Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Sci. 2007; 32: 372-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial presequences penetrate through the import channels of the translocators in the outer and inner membranes to reach the matrix, where it is grasped by mtHsp70 that is bound to the inner membrane translocator, the TIM23 complex, via its subunit Tim44 (9.Gaume B. Klaus C. Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1998; 16: 6497-6507Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10.Moro F. Sirrenberg C. Schneider H.-C. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Then a second mtHsp70 molecule cooperates with the first mtHsp70 to overcome the rate-limiting step of the import, active unfolding of the folded mature domain by the mechanism, which is still elusive. In the Brownian ratchet model, spontaneous unfolding of the mature domain allows translocation of the unfolded segment plus the presequence through the import channels by Brownian motions, once the first mtHsp70 dissociates from the TIM23 complex after hydrolysis of ATP (6.Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 7.Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the power stroke or lever arm model, mtHsp70 tethered to the outlet of the import channel undergoes a conformational change upon ATP hydrolysis to exert a mechanical pulling force on the precursor protein, which drives unfolding of the mature domain (11.Glick B. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Next in both models, binding of the second mtHsp70 to the translocated segment in the matrix prevents backsliding and refolding, thereby leading to global unfolding of the mature domain for subsequent translocation toward the mitochondrial interior. In the early 2000s, several new findings were reported in favor of the Brownian ratchet mechanism. Since mtHsp70 is locked onto the substrate protein in the ADP form, but not in the ATP form, during its ATPase cycle, the peptide-ADP-mtHsp70 complex needs tethering to the TIM23 complex to generate a mechanical pulling force in the lever arm model, whereas the peptide-ADP-mtHsp70 complex has to be released from the TIM23 complex to allow forward movement of the substrate polypeptide in the Brownian ratchet model. Liu et al. (12.Liu Q. D'Silva P. Walter W. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Science. 2003; 300: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) found that in the reconstitution system using purified mtHsp70, Mge1/Yge1, and Tim44, the peptide-ADP-mtHsp70 complex loses affinity for Tim44, which favors the latter situation. In the lever arm model, the distance between the binding sites for mtHsp70 cannot be larger than the one between the peptide binding site and the other end of the two-domain Hsp70 structure (∼115 Å) (13.Jiang J. Prasa K. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 23: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 14.Chang Y.-W. Sun Y.-J. Wang C. Hsiao C.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15502-15511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), otherwise, whereas mtHsp70 pulls in the substrate precursor protein by the distance as large as 115 Å by using Tim44 as a fulcrum, the second mtHsp70 cannot bind to the incoming segment to prevent backsliding. Okamoto et al. (15.Okamoto K. Brinker A. Paschen S.A. Moarefi I. Hayer-Hartl M. Neupert N. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2002; 15: 3659-3671Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) found that mitochondrial precursor proteins containing a 50-residue segment (∼170Åinan extended β-strand (16.Creighton T.E. Proteins. 2nd Ed. Freeman, NY1993: 183Google Scholar)) that cannot bind to mtHsp70 in front of folded domains can be imported into mitochondria, which is incompatible with the lever arm model. However, subsequent identification of several new mitochondrial Hsp70-associated motor and chaperone (MMC) proteins, partners for mtHsp70 mediating mitochondrial protein import, has changed the situation (17.Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 18.Bolender N. Sickmann A. Wagner R. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Among them, Tim14/Pam18 is a J protein specific for mtHsp70 and forms a complex with another J-like protein Tim16/Pam16. Tim44, which functions as a tethering point in the TIM23 complex for mtHsp70, is necessary to link the Tim14-Tim16 J complex to the TIM23 complex as well. This raised a possibility that nucleotide-dependent tethering to and release from the TIM23 complex for the peptide-mtHsp70 complex could be regulated by those additional partner proteins, which makes the findings by Liu et al. (12.Liu Q. D'Silva P. Walter W. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Science. 2003; 300: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) not crucial for the Brownian ratchet model. It also raised a possibility of the multiprotein lever arm consisting of mtHsp70 with e.g. Tim44, Tim14, Tim16, and/or Pam17, which could undergo a complex conformational change or power stroke of >50 residues, rendering the findings by Okamoto et al. (15.Okamoto K. Brinker A. Paschen S.A. Moarefi I. Hayer-Hartl M. Neupert N. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2002; 15: 3659-3671Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) not crucial for the Brownian ratchet model as well. Besides, the entropic pulling model (19.De Los Rios P. Ben-Zvi A. Slutsky O. Azem A. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was proposed for the generation of a pulling force with the nucleotide dependence of mtHsp70 tethering to the TIM23 complex, compatible with the findings by Liu et al. (12.Liu Q. D'Silva P. Walter W. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Science. 2003; 300: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this new model, the first mtHsp70 bound to the incoming presequence diffuses away from the TIM23 channel outlet to increase tumbling entropy in a more wide open space, which results in a mechanistic pulling force to achieve unfolding of the mature domain (8.Goloubinoff P. De Los Rios P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 372-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19.De Los Rios P. Ben-Zvi A. Slutsky O. Azem A. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, it became open again which of those different models mainly contributes to active unfolding of mitochondrial precursor proteins by the mtHsp70 import motor system. To assess the roles of mtHsp70 in unfolding of precursor proteins, we established here a system to characterize mtHsp70 as a molecular stepping motor, since the mtHsp70 system can proceed on the track of an unfolded polypeptide. Since two molecules of mtHsp70 alternately interact with the incoming polypeptide at the outlet of the TIM23 channel in a hand-over-hand manner, at least one mtHsp70 always stays on the substrate polypeptide to prevent it from slipping off the import channels, thereby functioning as a “processive” import motor (9.Gaume B. Klaus C. Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1998; 16: 6497-6507Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10.Moro F. Sirrenberg C. Schneider H.-C. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20.Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The operation mechanism of a processive stepping motor can be accessed by the analyses of its “step size” (21.Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The step size of the mtHsp70 import motor is a distance at which the mtHsp70 motor system moves upon a single step, i.e. during a single turnover of ATP. Step sizes of the motor proteins can often be analyzed by single molecule tracking, which is yet difficult to apply to such complex membrane-based systems as the mitochondrial mtHsp70 motor machinery. We thus set up an alternative experimental system with an appropriate theoretical framework to estimate the step sizes of the mitochondrial mtHsp70 import motor in intact organelles. Employing this system, we measured step sizes for model mitochondrial precursor proteins with a different mature domain. The estimated step sizes differ for different mature domains and different lengths of the spacers between the presequence and mature domain, therefore indicating that the Brownian ratchet is a sufficient and minimal mechanism for mtHsp70 to drive unfolding of precursor proteins. Model Fusion Proteins—The genes for the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), barnase (with mutation H102A), and heme binding domain of cytochrome b2 (HBD) fusion proteins containing variable spacer sequences of n = 10-80 residues with different lengths (m) of the Gly repeat (Gly(m)) (see Fig. 2A) were constructed as follows. The DNA fragments (Gly(10)-N (5′-GGGAGGCGGTGGAGGCGGTGGAGGCGGAGGCCTAGAGCTCATG-3′) and Gly(10)-C (5′-CATGAGCTCTAGGCCTCCGCCTCCACCGCCTCCACCGCCTCCC-3′)) for the 10-residue Gly repeat (Gly(10)); the DNA fragments (NA-N(5′-GGGTATGGCCAACGCTCTCTTGCTCACAGGCCTAGAGCTCATG-3′) and NA-C(5′-CATGAGCTCTAGGCCTGTGAGCAAGAGAGCGTTGGCCATACCC-3′)) for the NA segment (GMANALLLTG); and the DNA fragments (NR-N(5′-GGGTATGGCCAACAGACTCTTGCTCACAGGCCTAGAGCTCATG-3′) and NR-C(5′-CATGAGCTCTAGGCCTGTGAGCAAGAGTCTGTTGGCCATACCC-3′)) for the NR segment (GMANRLLLTG) were digested with SmaI and SacI and inserted into the SmaI/SacI sites of pBluescript II SK(-) to produce pBSK/Gly(10), pBSK/NA, and pBSK/NR, respectively. The DNA fragments for Gly(10), NA, and NR were cut out from pBSK/Gly(10), pBSK/NA, and pBSK/NR, respectively, with SmaI and SacI and were subsequently inserted into the StuI/SacI sites of pBSK/Gly(10), resulting in the DNA fragments for Gly(20), Gly(10)-NA, and Gly(10)-NR. Similar procedures were taken to construct the cassette DNAs for Gly(20)-N, Gly(30)-N, Gly(40)-N, Gly(50)-N, Gly(60)-N, Gly(0)-NN, Gly(10)-NN, Gly(20)-NN, Gly(30)-NN, Gly(40)-NN, Gly(50)-NN, Gly(60)-NN, Gly(0)-NGNG, Gly(10)-NGN, Gly(20)-NG, Gly(10)-NGNG, Gly(20)-NGN, Gly(30)-NG, Gly(20)-NGNG, Gly(30)-NGN, Gly(40)-NG, Gly(30)-NGNG, Gly(40)-NGN, Gly(50)-NG, and Gly(70), where N indicates NR or NA and G indicates Gly(10). pBSK/Gly(70)+linker DNA was subsequently amplified from pBSK/Gly(70) by PCR using the primers Gly-N (5′-GATATCGAATTCCTGCAGCCC-3′) and Gly(70)-C (5′-CGTACTCGAGAGCTGGAGCTCTAGGCC-3′) and inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pBluescript II SK(-). The plasmid bearing a DNA fragment for pb2(220)-DHFR (22.Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI and BamHI to obtain a DNA fragment for the first 167 residues of the cytochrome b2 precursor and inserted into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pUC119. Then the DNA fragment for residues 43-77 of the cytochrome b2 precursor was replaced with the one with the SmaI/XhoI site by PCR using the primer B2-40Sm2 (5′-TCCAAGTCGTTCCCGGGCTCGAGAATAGACAACGAGCCGA-3′) to yield pUC119/pb2(42). pBSK/Gly(70)+linker was digested with SmaI and XhoI and inserted into the SmaI/XhoI sites of pUC119/pb2(42) to yield pUC119/pb2(42)-Gly(70)+linker. pUC119/pb2(42)-Gly(70)+linker was then digested with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGEM2/pSu9(69)-HBD 5M.

Endo, unpublished results. to yield the DNA fragment for the fusion protein consisting of the first 42 residues of the cytochrome b2 precursor, Gly(70), the 10-residue linker segment (LELQLSRIDN), and the HBD. The DNA fragment for Gly(70) was replaced by PCR with the other cassette DNAs described above to obtain DNA fragments for the HBD fusion proteins with different spacer segments. The DNA fragment for the HBD was replaced with those for DHFR and barnase to obtain those for the DHFR and barnase fusion proteins. In Vitro Import—In vitro protein import into isolated mitochondria was performed as described previously (23.Yamamoto H. Esaki M. Kanamori T. Tamura Y. Nishikawa S. Endo T.

A. 2005; 102: 17999-18004Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fusion proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate by coupled transcription/translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled fusion proteins were incubated with isolated yeast mitochondria (0.5 mg protein/ml) in import buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 80 mm KCl, 2.5 mm KPi, 2 mm methionine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm NADH, 1% bovine serum albumin) at 16 or 30 °C. The import reactions were stopped by adding valinomycin to 10 μg/ml. The samples were halved, and one aliquot was treated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K (PK) for 20 min on ice. After the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation and were washed once with SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and radioimaging with a Storm 860 image analyzer (Amersham Biosciences). Utilization of the mtHsp70 Avoidance Segment between mtHsp70 Binding Sites to Measure Step Sizes of the Import Motor—Since a step size of the processive import motor can be operationally measured as a maximal distance between the binding sites for the first and second mtHsp70 molecules, we designed a series of model mitochondrial precursor proteins containing an Hsp70 avoidance segment that cannot bind to Hsp70 tightly. Assume that various lengths of the Hsp70 avoidance segment (m-residues) are inserted between the first and second mtHsp70 binding sites (10 residues each) in the presequence and following the spacer sequence (l residues), respectively, in front of the folded mature domain in model mitochondrial precursor proteins (Fig. 1A). After binding of mtHsp70 to the first (N-terminal) binding site, the second mtHsp70 binding site is mechanically pulled in (the lever arm and entropic pulling models) or is allowed to move forward by Brownian motions after spontaneous and transient unfolding of the folded domain outside mitochondria (the Brownian ratchet model) in the import channels by a distance of the step size (Fig. 1B, left panels). However, if the Hsp70 avoidance segment is longer than the step size, the second binding site for mtHsp70 located downstream of the Hsp70 avoidance segment is not accessible from the matrix so that backsliding and refolding of the precursor protein will prevail. Therefore, when we systematically change the length of the Hsp70 avoidance segment m, we can determine the step size of the mtHsp70 motor as a length of the Hsp70 avoidance segment (mc) at which the import rate significantly decreases (Fig. 1B, right panels). Evidently, step sizes depend on the folded mature domains differently in the different models. In the lever arm model, a conformational change of the lever involving mtHsp70 mechanically pulls in the presequence by the distance of the step size. In the entropic pulling model, tumbling entropy drives a mechanical pulling force, which depends only on the distance of mtHsp70 from the outlet of the import channel, which is as large as 30 Å (19.De Los Rios P. Ben-Zvi A. Slutsky O. Azem A. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, the step size as a maximal distance between the two mtHsp70 binding sites is constant for different mature domains in those two models (Fig. 1B, central and lower left panels). On the other hand, in the Brownian ratchet model, the maximal distance between the first Hsp70 that had bound to the presequence and the second Hsp70 that binds to the incoming unfolded segment depends on the size of spontaneous unfolding of the folded mature domain. The step size thus differs for different mature domains (Fig. 1B, upper left panel). Further consideration of the schematic models (Fig. 1B) reveals that step sizes depend on the total spacer lengths (l) differently in different models as well. Since ∼50 residues are long enough to span the two mitochondrial membranes (9.Gaume B. Klaus C. Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1998; 16: 6497-6507Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25.Rassow J. Hartl F.U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Neupert W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), (l-50) residues at the C terminus of the spacer sequence in front of the folded mature domain remain outside the import channels in an unfolded state in the beginning (the initial states in the three models in Fig. 1B, left panels). Then in the Brownian ratchet model, if the N-terminal y residue segment in the mature domain becomes spontaneously unfolded, x or (y + l - 50) residues of the fusion protein outside the mitochondria can enter the import channels by Brownian motions once the first mtHsp70 locked onto the fusion protein dissociates from the TIM23 complex in the matrix (Fig. 1B, upper left panel). In the lever arm and entropic pulling models, mtHsp70 directly pulls in the fusion protein by the distance of the conformational change of the mtHsp70 fulcrum or the entropy-driven diffusion (x residues), which leads to N-terminal unfolding of y or (x - l + 50) residues in the mature domain (Fig. 1B, central and lower left panels). In all those three models, the distance between the binding sites for the first and second mtHsp70 molecules, x, and the size of the local unfolding in the mature domain, y, are related to each other by the equation y=x-l+50 The size of local unfolding, y, directly linked to the step size, can be thus estimated as (mc - l + 50). Evidently, although the induced unfolding size (y), but not the step size (mc), depends on the lengths of the spacer sequences (l) in the lever arm and entropic pulling models (Fig. 1B, central and lower right panels), the Brownian ratchet model predicts that the step size (mc) for the same size of local unfolding (y) of the mature domain may well depend on the lengths of the spacer sequences (l) (Fig. 1B, upper right panel). Therefore, dependence of the step size (mc) on the length of mtHsp70 avoidance segment can be used to estimate the contribution of the Brownian ratchet mechanism in unfolding of the folded mature domains. Since the Hsp70 avoidance segment length dependence curves of the import rates differ for different spacer lengths l in any of the three models (Fig. 1B, right panels), a step size mc can be estimated only within a series of fusion proteins with the same spacer sequence length l, irrespective of the operating model. Model Fusion Proteins with an Hsp70 Avoidance Segment—We made a series of model fusion proteins containing a 43-residue mitochondrial matrix-targeting presequence (the N-terminal 42 residues of the cytochrome b2 presequence plus one residue), the C-terminal part (residues 33-43 past the matrix-processing peptidase (MPP) cleavage site) of which provides a first high affinity binding site for the first mtHsp70 (see below). This presequence is followed by various lengths of Gly repeat segments as an Hsp70 avoidance segment (15.Okamoto K. Brinker A. Paschen S.A. Moarefi I. Hayer-Hartl M. Neupert N. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2002; 15: 3659-3671Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (see below), a second high affinity binding site for mtHsp70, a 10-residue linker segment, and a folded mature domain (Fig. 2A). The second high affinity mtHsp70 binding sites consist of 10-residue NR (GMANRLLLTG) or NA (GMANALLLTG) segment, the former exhibiting higher affinity than the latter (27.Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) or 20-residue (NR)2 or (NA)2 segment. We chose mouse DHFR, the HBD, and barnase as model mature domains as they have different organizations of secondary structures (Fig. 2B). The VS (varying (spacer length) series of fusion proteins possesses spacer segments consisting of an m-residue Gly repeat (m = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60), which functions as an mtHsp70 avoidance segment followed by a 10- or 20-residue second mtHsp70 binding site and a 10-residue linker segment (Fig. 2A). Since the distance (l) between the first mtHsp70 binding site and the folded mature domain may affect import rates and the step size (mc) can be estimated from the Gly repeat length dependence curve of the import rates of the fusion proteins with the same spacer sequence length (Fig. 1B), we also prepared a CS (constant (spacer length) series of fusion proteins with a constant length (l = (n + 10) residues) of the spacer segment that consists of the m-residue Gly repeat (m = n-40, n-30, n-20, or n-10) followed by an (n-m)-residue alternate sequence of the 10-residue NR or NA segment and a 10-residue Gly repeat and the 10-residue linker segment (Fig. 2A). We first confirmed that the presequence and spacer segments of the fusion proteins contain a high affinity binding site for mtHsp70 and an mtHsp70 avoidance segment, respectively, as expected. We incubated the CS DHFR fusion proteins with a 50-, 60-, 70-, or 80-residue spacer sequence (n = 40, 50, 60, or 70) containing a 30-residue Gly repeat and the NR segment as a binding site for mtHsp70 (Fig. 2A) with isolated mitochondria in the presence of methotrexate (MTX). Since a DHFR domain stabilized by its ligand MTX cannot go across the outer membrane, a presequence-containing DHFR fusion protein complexed with MTX forms a two-membrane spanning intermediate. The MTX-stabilized intermediate becomes resistant against PK only if mtHsp70 is tightly associated with the segment of the intermediate that is exposed to the matrix since tight binding of mtHsp70 blocks back sliding of the intermediate through the import channel so that the DHFR domain is tightly apposed to the outer membrane to prevent access of the added protease to the spacer segment (6.Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 28.Schwarz E. Seytter T. Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Now we found that the presequence-cleaved mature forms of the fusion proteins with a 50- or 60-residue spacer sequence were PK-resistant, whereas those with a 70- or 80-residue spacer sequence were PK-sensitive (Fig. 3). This indicates that the DHFR domains of the fusion proteins with a 50- or 60-residue spacer, but not of those with a 70- or 80-residue spacer, are closely apposed to the outer membrane. A previous study showed that ∼52 amino acid residues in front of a folded protein domain are sufficient to span both mitochondrial membranes and to allow the interaction with mtHsp70 in the matrix (9.Gaume B. Klaus C. Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1998; 16: 6497-6507Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, mtHsp70 binds to the C-terminal part (residues 33-43) of the presequence after cleavage of the N-terminal part by MPP so that the fusion protein is prevented from backsliding in the import channels. On the other hand, since the DHFR domain of the fusion proteins with a 70- or 80-residue spacer is not closely apposed to the outer membrane, the Gly repeat of those with a 70- or 80-residue spacer that is exposed to the matrix by Brownian motions is not capable of binding to mtHsp70 so that the fusion proteins can backslide in the import channels for access to the added protease. Therefore, the C-terminal part (residues 33-43) past the MPP cleavage site of the presequence provides a high affinity binding site for mtHsp70, whereas a Gly repeat sequence functions as an mtHsp70 avoidance segment. In Vitro Import of the Fusion Proteins Depends on Gly Repeat Lengths and Folded Mature Domains—The radiolabeled DHFR, HBD, and barnase fusion proteins with a spacer sequence containing different lengths of the Gly repeat were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate. Protease treatment of the fusion proteins revealed that folding of the mature domains is not significantly affected by the attachment of the presequence and spacer sequences (data not shown). The fusion proteins were incubated with isolated yeast mitochondria at 16 or 30 °C in the presence of ATP. Amounts of protease-protected, imported mature forms were plotted against incubation time, and import rates were determined from the initial slopes for VS fusion proteins and CS fusion proteins (Fig. 4). Under the present import conditions, unfolding of the folded mature domain is rate-limiting in the entire import process (29.Huang S. Ratiff K.S. Schwartz M.P. Spenner J.M. Matouschek A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1132-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We found first that both VS and CS series of DHFR, HBD, and barnase fusion proteins with the NR segments behind the Gly repeats exhibited higher import rates than those with NA segments (Fig. 4). This points to the important role of binding of the second mtHsp70 to the incoming unfolded segment, likely in preventing the backsliding and refolding of the remaining part of the substrate protein. Second, we found that the Gly repeat length dependence curves or step sizes of CS series of the fusion proteins differ for different lengths of the spacer sequences (Fig. 4B). Theoretical consideration predicts that although the induced unfolding size (y), but not the step size (mc), depends on the lengths of the spacer sequences (l) in the lever arm and entropy-pulling models, the step size for the same size of local unfolding of the mature domain depends on the lengths of the spacer sequences in the Brownian ratchet model (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the spacer length-dependent step sizes of the CS series of the fusion proteins (Fig. 4B) support the involvement of the Brownian ratchet mechanism. The step size mc is determined as a critical length of the Gly repeat at which the import rate significantly decreases (Fig. 1B). We thus determined the step sizes for CS HBD fusion proteins with NR as 20 and 30 residues for n = 40 and 50, respectively, and for CS barnase fusion proteins with NR or NA as 20, 30, and 40 residues for n = 40, 50, and 60, respectively (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, although apparent step sizes for CS DHFR fusion proteins with NR or NA are 40 and 50 residues for n = 60 and 70, respectively, at 30 °C, a different step size of ≥60 and ≥70 residues for n = 60 and n = 70, respectively, may be overlapped since the DHFR fusion proteins were still imported efficiently even with 60 residues of Gly repeats at 30 °C. Step sizes for the HBD and barnase fusion proteins are thus different from those for the DHFR fusion proteins when compared for the same total spacer lengths, indicating that the Brownian ratchet, which predicts that step sizes differ for different mature domains, is a likely mechanism that contributes primarily to unfolding of the folded domain by mtHsp70. Estimation of the Unfolding Sizes That Are Linked to the Measured Step Sizes—In the Brownian ratchet model, an unfolding size (y) of the mature domain that is directly linked to the step size can be estimated as mc - n + 40 (Fig. 1B). Unfolding sizes for the HBD fusion proteins and barnase fusion proteins are thus estimated as ∼20 residues by using the determined mc values (e.g. mc = 20 and 30 for n = 40 and 50, respectively). On the other hand, although the smaller mc values (e.g. mc = 50 for n = 70) indicate the unfolding size (y) of the DHFR domain as ∼20 residues at 30 °C, the larger mc values (mc ≥ 70 for n = 70) suggest the presence of a larger amplitude (≥40 residues) of unfolding at 30 °C. The suggested unfolding sizes or sizes of the unfolding structural units for the HBD, barnase, and DHFR are consistent with their structures (Fig. 2B). In the HBD and barnase, residues 12-17 and residues 7-17, respectively, form helical structural units, the opening of which (∼20 residues) appears to involve disruption of the local hydrophobic cores, and its trapping by the second mtHsp70 may efficiently trigger global unfolding. On the other hand, both the N-terminal segment and the C-terminal segment of DHFR are involved in the same β-sheet structure, and the N-terminal β-strand is further sandwiched by the two α-helices. Therefore, although the N-terminal 10-residue β-segment plus 10-residue loop may spontaneously unfold (∼20 residues) and trigger global unfolding, its unfolding is likely inefficient and comparable with that of more global unfolding (≥40 residues). Here we consider the case in which unfolding of the revealed N-terminal structural units take place in a highly cooperative manner. In such a case, unfolding could be triggered by not only spontaneous and transient structural breathing (the Brownian ratchet model) but also partial disruption of the structural elements by a mechanical pulling force. Then the unfolded segments can further enter the matrix by Brownian motions if the bound first mtHsp70 is released from the TIM23 complex (in the Brownian ratchet and entropy-pulling models but not in the lever arm model) and can be trapped by the second mtHsp70. Therefore, if positions, sizes, and stabilities of the N-terminal structural units are sufficiently appropriate, the entropy-pulling mechanism is logically not mutually exclusive with the Brownian ratchet mechanism. We also note in Fig. 4 that the import rates of the CS barnase fusion proteins, but not their VS versions or the HBD fusion proteins, exhibited peculiar reverse V-shaped dependence on the Gly repeat length; import rates are smaller for the CS fusion proteins with m = n - 40 than those with m = n - 30 (e.g. compare fusion proteins with (m, n) = (0, 40), (10, 50), and (20, 60) with those with (m, n) = (10, 40), (20, 50), and (30, 60), respectively). This reverse V-shaped dependence of the import rates on the Gly repeat length can be also explained by the framework of the Brownian ratchet model. Fig. 5 shows schematic representation of the second mtHsp70 binding to the CS barnase fusion proteins with transient unfolding of the N-terminal 10-, 20-, or 30-residue region. Since CS fusion proteins have only a 10-residue NR or NA segment as the second mtHsp70 binding, CS fusion proteins with m = n - 40 and m = n - 30 allow the transiently opened species with N-terminal unfolding of ∼10 or ∼30 residues and ∼20 residues, respectively, in the mature domains to be trapped by the second mtHsp70 if we ignore larger (≥40 residues) unfolding for simplification (crosses indicate that the second mtHsp70 cannot bind to the incoming NR or NA segment). According to the structure of barnase (Fig. 2B), residues 7-17 of barnase form an amphiphilic helix on the periphery of the molecule, which may well form a cooperative structural unit to become detached transiently from the rest of the molecule through ∼20-residue N-terminal unfolding. On the other hand, 10-residue N-terminal unfolding of barnase does not seem to take place frequently because it is achieved only by partial, but not entire, disruption of the amphiphilic helix (residues 7-17). Thirty-residue unfolding also seems to take place infrequently because hydrophobic interactions between Leu-20 and Tyr-24 likely prevent further large (∼30-residue) unfolding after detachment of the amphiphilic helix. Thus for the barnase fusion proteins, 20-residue unfolding may well take place most frequently, and trapping of 20-residue unfolding is the most efficient in inducing global unfolding so that the fusion proteins with m = n - 30 were imported most efficiently (Fig. 4B). Conclusions—In the present study, we have established a novel method to determine the step sizes of the protein import motor for mitochondrial precursor proteins. Estimated step sizes of the mtHsp70 processive import motor differ for different folded mature domains and depend on the lengths of the spacers between the presequence and mature domain. These results suggest that the Brownian ratchet is a sufficient and minimal mechanism to explain active unfolding of precursor proteins by two mtHsp70 molecules for protein import, although additional (likely minor) contribution of the lever arm and/or entropic pulling mechanism, depending on the mature domains, presequences, etc., is not ruled out. In other words, the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous N-terminal unfolding of the mature domain are sufficient, if harvested efficiently by the Brownian ratchet trapping, to promote rate-limiting global unfolding of the mature domain. This also means that the analyses of the step sizes of the mitochondrial mtHsp70 motor could reveal detailed dynamic aspects of spontaneous local unfolding around the N-terminal region of the folded proteins, which could complement the information obtained by e.g. NMR hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange experiments. The proposed method to estimate step sizes of the unfolding motor is readily applied to other protein unfolding machineries that are too complex to use single-molecule tracking techniques, including translocators in other membranes and ATP-dependent proteases, by introducing appropriate segments for motor binding as well as motor avoidance into substrate polypeptides as a track for the motor system.

However, in humans, important cytotoxic side effects are observed including dose-limiting renal damage and profound gastrointestinal symptomatology. The toxic responses to cisplatin in mice are similar to those in human patients. Here, we evaluated whether the acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) mediates at least some of the toxic in vivo effects of cisplatin. To this end, we determined the toxic effects of a single intraperitoneal dose of cisplatin (27 mg/kg) in wild type (Asm(+/+)) and Asm-deficient mice (Asm(-/-)). Tissue injury and apoptosis were determined histologically on hematoxylin-eosin and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated nick end labeling) stainings 3, 12, 36 and 72 h after treatment. Our results revealed severe toxicity of cisplatin in Asm(+/+) mice with increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the thymus and small intestine. In marked contrast, Asm(-/-) mice were resistant to cisplatin and no apoptosis was observed in these organs after treatment. Moreover, cisplatin treatment primarily triggered apoptosis of endothelial cells in microvessels of intestine and thymus, an effect that was absent in mice lacking Asm. The data thus suggest that at least some toxic effects of cisplatin are mediated by the Asm in vivo resulting in early death of endothelial cells and consecutive organ damage."

We find that DNA-dependent Protein Kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and Ataxia Telangectasia Mutated (ATM) are necessary for the generation of such a bystander signal in normal human cells following gamma (gamma)-ray exposure, but are not required for its reception. Importantly, we also show that directly irradiated human cells do not respond to receipt of a bystander signal, helping to explain why the BSE is a low-dose phenomenon. These studies provide the first evidence for a role of the DNA damage response proteins DNA-PKcs and ATM specifically in the generation of a bystander signal and intercellular signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1993957411,"The survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires detoxification of host *NO. Oxygenated Mycobacterium tuberculosis truncated hemoglobin N catalyzes the rapid oxidation of nitric oxide to innocuous nitrate with a second-order rate constant (k'(NOD) approximately 745 x 10(6) m(-1) x s(-1)), which is approximately 15-fold faster than the reaction of horse heart myoglobin. We ask what aspects of structure and/or dynamics give rise to this enhanced reactivity. A first step is to expose what controls ligand/substrate binding to the heme. We present evidence that the main barrier to ligand binding to deoxy-truncated hemoglobin N (deoxy-trHbN) is the displacement of a distal cavity water molecule, which is mainly stabilized by residue Tyr(B10) but not coordinated to the heme iron. As observed in the Tyr(B10)/Gln(E11) apolar mutants, once this kinetic barrier is lowered, CO and O(2) binding is very rapid with rates approaching 1-2 x 10(9) m(-1) x s(-1). These large values almost certainly represent the upper limit for ligand binding to a heme protein and also indicate that the iron atom in trHbN is highly reactive. Kinetic measurements on the photoproduct of the *NO derivative of met-trHbN, where both the *NO and water can be directly followed, revealed that water rebinding is quite fast (approximately 1.49 x 10(8) s(-1)) and is responsible for the low geminate yield in trHbN. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed with trHbN and its distal mutants, indicated that in the absence of a distal water molecule, ligand access to the heme iron is not hindered. They also showed that a water molecule is stabilized next to the heme iron through hydrogen-bonding with Tyr(B10) and Gln(E11)."

By dissecting the SlyA regulon using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture analysis, we found that SlyA enhances overall transcription of PhoP-activated loci. This amplification of cellular responses to Mg2+ occurs when SlyA binds to the phoPQ promoter thereby activating phoP autoregulation via a positive feedback mechanism. SlyA footprints a DNA region located one helical turn upstream of the PhoP box, which overlaps the H-NS-binding motif required for signal-dependent phoP repression in high Mg2+ conditions. Therefore, binding of SlyA likely antagonizes H-NS and facilitates the interaction of PhoP to its own promoter, subsequently activating the phoPQ operon. Establishment of this regulatory circuit allows SlyA to exert its effect on the PhoP/PhoQ system specifically in Salmonella, which may confer an additional transcriptional regulation. Thus, our results provide a molecular mechanism that determines SlyA-dependent activation of PhoP-regulated genes in modulating Salmonella virulence. Evidence from this study also suggests a function of SlyA as a mediator in signal transduction from the PhoP/PhoQ system to other bacterial two-component systems in Salmonella."
https://openalex.org/W1996842617,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) mediates efficient endocytosis of VLDL, VLDL remnants, and LDL. As part of the endocytic process, the LDLR releases lipoproteins in endosomes. The release process correlates with an acid-dependent conformational change in the receptor from an extended, “open” state to a compact, “closed” state. The closed state has an intramolecular contact involving H190, H562, and H586. The current model for lipoprotein release holds that protonation of these histidines drives the conformational change that is associated with release. We tested the roles of H190, H562, and H586 on LDLR conformation and on lipoprotein binding, uptake, and release using variants in which the three histidines were replaced with alanine (AAA variant) or in which the histidines were replaced with charged residues that can form ionic contacts at neutral pH (DRK variant). Contrary to expectation, both the AAA and the DRK variants exhibited normal acid-dependent transitions from open to closed conformations. Despite this similarity, both the AAA and DRK mutations modulated lipoprotein release, indicating that H190, H562, and H586 act subsequent to the conformational transition. These observations also suggest that the intramolecular contact does not drive release through a competitive mechanism. In support of this possibility, mutagenesis experiments showed that β-VLDL binding was inhibited by mutations at D203 and E208, which are exposed in the closed conformation of the LDLR. We propose that H190, H562, and H586 are part of an allosteric mechanism that drives lipoprotein release. The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) mediates efficient endocytosis of VLDL, VLDL remnants, and LDL. As part of the endocytic process, the LDLR releases lipoproteins in endosomes. The release process correlates with an acid-dependent conformational change in the receptor from an extended, “open” state to a compact, “closed” state. The closed state has an intramolecular contact involving H190, H562, and H586. The current model for lipoprotein release holds that protonation of these histidines drives the conformational change that is associated with release. We tested the roles of H190, H562, and H586 on LDLR conformation and on lipoprotein binding, uptake, and release using variants in which the three histidines were replaced with alanine (AAA variant) or in which the histidines were replaced with charged residues that can form ionic contacts at neutral pH (DRK variant). Contrary to expectation, both the AAA and the DRK variants exhibited normal acid-dependent transitions from open to closed conformations. Despite this similarity, both the AAA and DRK mutations modulated lipoprotein release, indicating that H190, H562, and H586 act subsequent to the conformational transition. These observations also suggest that the intramolecular contact does not drive release through a competitive mechanism. In support of this possibility, mutagenesis experiments showed that β-VLDL binding was inhibited by mutations at D203 and E208, which are exposed in the closed conformation of the LDLR. We propose that H190, H562, and H586 are part of an allosteric mechanism that drives lipoprotein release.

Lipoproteins bind to the extracellular domain (ectodomain) of the LDLR, which contains a ligand binding domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF) homology domain, and an O-glycosylated domain (1Yamamoto T.

Following lipoprotein binding, LDLR-lipoprotein complexes internalize through clathrin-coated pits and traffic to sorting endosomes where lipoprotein release occurs (22Anderson R.G. Brown M.S.

Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Nature. 1987; 326: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Release occurs at ∼pH 6, which corresponds to the luminal pH of sorting endosomes (5Davis C.G.

Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Coincident with lipoprotein release, the LDLR undergoes a conformational transition from an extended, “open” conformation, which predominates at neutral pH, to a compact, “closed” conformation at acidic pH (24Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the LDLR ectodomain at acidic pH shows that in the closed conformation, the β-propeller region of the EGF homology domain forms an intramolecular contact with LA repeats 4 and 5 (24Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). At the center of this contact are three histidines (H190, H562, and H586) that form van der Waals contacts and ionic interactions between the β-propeller and the LA repeats. The ionic interactions presumably only form when histidine is positively charged. The imidazole ring of histidine has a pKa of ∼6, suggesting that the three histidines are protonated at endosomal pH. These observations have led to the current model for acid-dependent lipoprotein release (25Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 309-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This model proposes that the β-propeller of the EGF homology domain binds to the lipoprotein binding surfaces of LA4 and LA5. Release occurs through dissociation of lipoprotein from the LA repeats followed by binding of the β-propeller to LA4/5. The model also stipulates that the binding of the β-propeller with LA4/5 requires protonation of H190, H562, and H586. Consistent with this model, mutation of all three histidines to alanine inhibits LDL release (26Beglova N. Jeon H. Fisher C. Blacklow S.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The current model makes two key predictions. First, the conformational state of the receptor should depend upon the ability of residues at 190, 562, and 586 to form ionic contacts. Second, lipoproteins should bind to the same surface as the β-propeller. Here, we tested the current model. We examined the role of the three histidines on receptor conformation and on lipoprotein binding, uptake, and release using LDLR variants in which the three histidines were replaced with alanine or in which the histidines were replaced with charged residues that can maintain ionic interactions at neutral pH. We also used mutagenesis to test whether lipoproteins bind to the same surface on the LDLR as the β-propeller of the EGF homology domain. Materials—All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). LDLR-/- primary human fibroblasts, human LDL, and rabbit β-migrating VLDL (β-VLDL) were a gift from Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein (Department of Molecular Genetics, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Rabbit polyclonal anti-LDLR (4548) was a gift from Joachim Herz (Department of Molecular Genetics, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Mouse monoclonal anti-LDLR (C7) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Alexa546 succinimidyl ester was from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Baculovirus-mediated Protein Expression—Residues 1–699 of the LDLR, LDLR-AAA, and LDLR-DRK were cloned into the pFastBac plasmid (Invitrogen). Recombinant plasmids were used to produce infectious baculoviruses that directed the synthesis of secreted LDLR ectodomains using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Cell Culture—LDLR-/- primary fibroblasts (isolate 549) were immortalized using the pBabe-puro-hTERT retrovirus (27Counter C.M. Hahn W.C. Wei W. Caddle S.D. Beijersbergen R.L. Lansdorp P.M.

Puromycin-resistant fibroblasts (549T) showed no differences in morphology or growth rate as compared with parental primary fibroblasts, but were no longer limited in the number of cell divisions. In longevity tests, the 549T cells continued to divide normally over the course of 18 months. The behavior of the 549T LDLR-/- fibroblasts was consistent with prior reports showing that ectopic expression of telomerase prevents senescence, but does not induce transformed phenotypes in fibroblasts (28Morales C.P. Holt S.E. Ouellette M. Kaur K.J. Yan Y. Wilson K.S. White M.A. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). All fibroblasts were cultured in Medium A (DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Prior to experimentation, fibroblasts were starved of lipoproteins for 24 h by replacing the culture medium with Medium B (DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) lipoprotein poor serum, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml)). Gel Filtration—Gel filtration was conducted on a Superdex200 10/30 column attached to an Äkta FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated in buffers at pH 6–7 containing 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm maleate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Triton X-100 was required to maintain the LDLR ectodomains in solution at acidic pH. Samples were equilibrated in the same buffers prior to loading. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, electrophoresed on 5–17% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and immunoblotted for the LDLR using the 4548 polyclonal antibody. Thyroglobulin (85 Å), apoferritin (61 Å), amylase (48 Å), aldolase (45 Å), bovine serum albumin (36 Å), and carbonic anhydrase (20 Å) were used as standards. Introduction of LDLR Variants into LDLR-/- Fibroblasts—LDLR variants were cloned into the pMX-IRES-GFP bicistronic retroviral vector (29Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Retroviral vectors were cotransfected with the pAmpho packaging vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) into 293T cells to produce infectious, replication-defective retroviruses. Retroviruses were added to LDLR-/- fibroblasts (549T) in the presence of hexadimethrine bromide to facilitate viral entry. Infection rates as assessed by GFP-positive fluorescence were ∼5%. GFP-positive, LDLR-expressing fibroblasts were purified using two rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with a MoFlo High Performance Cell Sorter (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Purity was ∼90% after the first sort and > 95% after the second sort. Surface LDLR expression was monitored by flow cytometry using anti-LDLR mouse monoclonal antibody, C7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Lipoprotein Binding Assays—Human 125I-LDL and rabbit 125I-β-VLDL binding assays were performed in triplicate using established methods (30Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Assays were preformed at 4 °C for 90 min using concentrations of 125I-LDL or 125I-β-VLDL indicated in the figure legends. Results are presented as means ± S.D. Initial Endocytic Rates—Initial internalization rates were determined as previously described (31Lombardi P. Mulder M. van der Boom H. Frants R.R. Havekes L.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml 125I-LDL or 5 μg/ml 125I-β-VLDL for 1 h at 4 °C in Medium C (bicarbonate-free MEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5 and 10% lipoprotein-poor serum). Medium was changed for the times indicated with warm Medium B that also containing either 10 μg/ml 125I-LDL or 5 μg/ml 125I-β-VLDL. Cells were extensively washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 1 mg/ml Protease K in Buffer A (PBS + 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 4 °C. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min over a cushion of 10% sucrose in PBS. The tubes were frozen in liquid nitrogen, cut to separate the cell pellet (internal) from the solution (surface-bound material released by protease K) and counted on a gamma counter. Results are presented as means ± S.D. Fluorescent Lipoprotein Labeling—DiI (3H-Indolium, 2-(3-(1,3-dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-1-octadecyl-2H-indol-2-ylidene)-1-propenyl)-3,3-dimethyl-1-octadecyl-, perchlorate) was used to label β-VLDL by adding 300 μl of 3 mg/ml DiI suspended in DMSO to 10 mg of β-VLDL in 10 ml of lipoprotein-poor serum with gentle mixing. The suspension was mixed end-over-end for 16 h at 37 °C in the dark. The density of the suspension was increased to 1.019 by the addition of 0.0199 g of KBr per ml of suspension and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. DiI-β-VLDL was removed from the top of the tube, dialyzed against PBS, and stored at 4 °C in the dark until use. LDL was labeled using Alexa-546 succinimidyl ester using the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Invitrogen). Lipoprotein Accumulation—Cells were incubated with either 10 μg/ml Alexa546-LDL or 5 μg/ml DiI-β-VLDL in Medium C for 1 h at 4 °C. The medium was then replaced with warm Medium B containing 10 μg/ml Alexa546-LDL or 5 μg/ml DiI-β-VLDL for the times indicated. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, suspended by gentle scraping in PBS and fixed in the presence of 3% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Mean fluorescence intensities were recorded for 10,000 events for each experiment. Acid-dependent Release of Cell Surface-bound Lipoprotein—Assays were performed at both 4 and 37 °C. For assays at 4 °C, cells were incubated with either 10 μg/ml 125I-LDL or 5 μg/ml 125I-β-VLDL in Medium C for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold Buffer B (TBS + 1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated with Medium D (bicarbonate-free MEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm maleate, and 10% lipoprotein-poor serum) at pH 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, or 7.5 for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed two times with ice-cold TBS, one time for 10 min with ice-cold Buffer B and two times with ice-cold TBS. Remaining cell-associated, 125I-labeled lipoproteins were liberated by incubation with 0.1 n NaOH and counted on a gamma counter. For assays at 37 °C, cells were preincubated with Medium E, which consisted of Medium B supplemented with 0.45 m sucrose to prevent clathrin-coated pit endocytosis (33Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with either 10 μg/ml 125I-LDL or 5 μg/ml 125I-β-VLDL in Medium E for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with warm Medium E, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with Medium F (bicarbonate-free MEM supplemented with 0.45 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm maleate, and 10% lipoprotein-poor serum) at pH 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, or 7.5. The cells were washed two times with ice-cold TBS, one time for 10 min with ice-cold Buffer B and two times with ice-cold TBS. Remaining cell-associated, 125I-labeled lipoproteins were liberated by incubation with 0.1 n NaOH and counted. All experiments were performed in triplicate and are presented as a fraction of counts in parallel assays in which the acid release step was omitted. Rate constants for release were determined by non-linear curve fitting using a single-phase exponential decay model. Data for the curve fitting was from Fig. 5 with the exception of β-VLDL release at 4 °C, which used release data collected over 30 min (data not shown). H190, H562, and H586 have been proposed to constitute a pH sensor that controls receptor conformation, thereby regulating lipoprotein binding and release (24Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 25Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 2004; 16: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To test whether these histidines control the conformational state of the LDLR, we used a baculovirus expression system to produce proteins encompassing the LDLR ectodomain of normal LDLR, of an LDLR variant in which H190, H562, and H586 were replaced with alanine, and of an LDLR variant in which the histidines were replaced with charged residues. If the histidine contacts are required for the closed conformation, then the alanine (AAA) variant should be fixed in the open conformation. By contrast, if the ionic interactions made by the histidines are sufficient to drive adoption of the closed variant, then replacement of the histidines with charged residues that can form ionic contacts at neutral pH should fix the LDLR ectodomain in the closed conformation. The charged variant (DRK) had the following mutations: H190D, H562R, and H586K. The H190D and H562R mutations were designed to form one ionic interaction, while the H586K mutation was designed to form a second interaction with D149 (Fig. 1A). Normal, AAA, and DRK ectodomains were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells, equilibrated in buffers of different pH and chromatographed on a superdex 200 gel filtration column using the same buffers. Gel filtration separates proteins based upon their hydrodynamic (Stokes) radius and allows separation of the open and closed states of the LDLR (24Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Initial experiments showed that all three ectodomain proteins underwent a conformational transition from a Stokes radius of 43 Å to a radius of 38 Å between pH 7 and pH 6. Further gel filtration experiments within this pH range showed that the pH of half-maximal transition for each ectodomain was ∼pH 6.6 (Fig. 1B). The ability of the LDLR-AAA ectodomain to adopt the closed conformation indicates that the ionic contacts formed by the three histidines at acidic pH are not necessary for adoption of the closed conformation. The ability of the LDLR-DRK to adopt the open conformation indicates that ionic contacts at amino acid positions 190, 562, and 586 are not sufficient for adoption of the closed conformation. Thus, H190, H562, and H586 are neither necessary nor sufficient for the conformational transition associated with lipoprotein release. While not required for the conformational transition, prior mutational data suggest that H190, H562, and H586 play a significant role in LDLR function. Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is associated with tyrosine substitutions at H190 and H562 (34Hopkins P.N. Wu L.L. Stephenson S.H. Xin Y. Katsumata H. Nobe Y. Nakajima T. Hirayama T. Emi M. Williams R.R. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Sun X.M. Patel D.D. Webb J.C. Knight B.L. Fan L.M. Cai H.J. Soutar A.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 85-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, triple alanine or tyrosine mutations at H190, H562, and H586 inhibit acid-dependent LDL release from the surface of CHO cells expressing these variants (26Beglova N. Jeon H. Fisher C. Blacklow S.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). How might the three histidines participate in LDLR function? To answer this question, we used fibroblasts that stably express full-length normal LDLR, LDLR-AAA or LDLR-DRK receptors in experiments measuring lipoprotein binding, uptake, and release. Full-length cDNAs for normal LDLR, LDLR-AAA, and LDLR-DRK were introduced into LDLR-/- fibroblasts by retroviral infection. LDLR expression was driven by the 5′-LTR of the retrovirus, which also produced GFP through an internal ribosomal entry site downstream of the coding sequence for the LDLR. GFP-positive cells thus express LDLR, allowing LDLR-expressing cells to be purified by FACS. Infection rates were kept to ∼5% so as to ensure that infected cells had only a single integration event. Consistent with a homogeneous expression level, the variance observed in surface LDLR of infected cells was similar to that seen in normal human fibroblasts expressing the endogenous LDLR (data not shown). Immunoblots of cell lysates showed that LDLR expression was similar in each cell line and that the total LDLR expression level in the infected fibroblasts was only 2–3-fold higher than endogenous LDLR expression in normal human fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). No immature LDLR was observed, indicating that all three variants were glycosylated normally in the Golgi. Flow cytometry using the C7 anti-LDLR antibody showed that cells expressing normal LDLR, LDLR-AAA, and LDLR-DRK had similar numbers of LDLR on their cell surfaces (Fig. 2B). No LDLR was detected in LDLR-/- fibroblasts infected with retroviruses lacking an LDLR gene (Vector). Together, these observations indicate that the AAA and DRK mutations did not impair the expression or surface delivery of the LDLR. The role of the three histidines in lipoprotein binding was determined by comparing the affinity of 125I-LDL and 125I-β-VLDL for cells expressing normal LDLR, LDLR-AAA, and LDLR-DRK. β-VLDL is a VLDL remnant particle that is commonly used to assess the binding and uptake of VLDL/VLDL remnants by the LDLR (36Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1839-1848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding was assessed in saturation experiments in which increasing concentrations of 125I-LDL or 125I-β-VLDL were incubated with cells at 4 °C. In these assays, LDLR-AAA cells bound LDL normally; however, LDLR-DRK cells showed reduced ability to bind LDL (Fig. 3A). Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed that cells expressing the DRK variant had lost high affinity binding activity for LDL (data not shown). By contrast, both the LDLR-AAA cells and LDLR-DRK cells bound β-VLDL normally (Fig. 3B). The ability of LDLR-AAA cells to bind both LDL and β-VLDL normally indicated that the three histidines were not required for lipoprotein binding. After internalization, LDLR-lipoprotein complexes are transported to endosomes where lipoprotein release occurs. We followed lipoprotein release using two assays: 1) surface assays in which cell-surface bound lipoproteins were released in response to acidic buffers, and 2) cellular assays in which lipoprotein release was followed as a function of lipoprotein internalization and accumulation over time. In the surface assays, normal LDLR, LDLR-AAA, and LDLR-DRK cells were incubated with 125I-labeled lipoproteins at 4 °C or 37 °C and then shifted to medium at pH 5.5–7.5 in the absence of lipoprotein for 30 min. Release was followed by measuring the amount of 125I-labeled lipoproteins that remained cell associated after the 30-min incubation. In surface assays at 4 °C, LDLR-AAA cells showed reduced ability to release lipoproteins in response to acidic buffers. Normal LDLR-expressing cells had half-maximal LDL"

https://openalex.org/W2049742490,"Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive human disease characterized by genetic instability, radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition, because of mutation in both alleles of the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) gene. The role of Atm heterozygosity in cancer susceptibility is controversial, in both human and mouse. Earlier studies identified deletions near the Atm gene on mouse chromosome 9 in radiation-induced lymphomas from p53 heterozygous mice. To determine whether Atm was the target of these deletions, Atm heterozygous as well as Atm/P53 double heterozygous mice were treated with ionizing radiation. There were no significant differences in tumor latency, progression and lifespan after gamma-radiation in Atm heterozygous mice compared with their wild-type control counterparts. Deletions were found on chromosome 9 near the Atm locus in radiation-induced tumors, but in 50% of the cases the deletion included the knockout allele, and the expression of Atm was maintained in the tumors indicating that loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9 is not driven by Atm, but by an alternative tumor suppressor gene located near Atm on this chromosome. We conclude that Atm heterozygosity does not confer an increase in tumor susceptibility in this context."
https://openalex.org/W2029670344,"LicT belongs to a family of bacterial transcriptional antiterminators, which control the expression of sugar-metabolizing operons in response to phosphorylations by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). Previous studies of LicT have revealed the structural basis of RNA recognition by the dimeric N-terminal co-antiterminator (CAT) domain on the one hand and the conformational changes undergone by the duplicated regulation domain (PRD1 and PRD2) upon activation on the other hand. To investigate the mechanism of signal transduction between the effector and regulation modules, we have undertaken the characterization of a fragment, including the CAT and PRD1 domains and the linker in-between. Comparative experiments, including RNA binding assays, NMR spectroscopy, limited proteolysis, analytical ultracentrifugation, and circular dichroism, were conducted on native CAT-PRD1 and on a constitutively active CAT-PRD1 mutant carrying a D99N substitution in PRD1. We show that in the native state, CAT-PRD1 behaves as a rather unstable RNA-binding deficient dimer, in which the CAT dimer interface is significantly altered and the linker region is folded as a trypsin-resistant helix. In the activated mutant form, the CAT-PRD1 linker becomes protease-sensitive, and the helix content decreases, and the CAT module adopts the same dimeric conformation as in isolated CAT, thereby restoring the affinity for RNA. From these results, we propose that a helix-to-coil transition in the linker acts as the structural relay triggered by the regulatory domain for remodeling the effector dimer interface. In essence, the structural mechanism modulating the LicT RNA antitermination activity is thus similar to that controlling the DNA binding activity of dimeric transcriptional regulators."
https://openalex.org/W1998725631,"In 3T3-L1 cells, HuR is constitutively expressed and prior to induction of differentiation localized predominantly to the nucleus. Within minutes of induction of differentiation, nuclear HuR binds to its target ligand mRNAs, and the complexes appear to move to the cytosol. One ligand mRNA is the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) message. To examine the function and importance of the HuR-C/EBPbeta interaction, retroviral expression constructs were created in which the HuR binding site was altered by deletion (betadel) or deletion and substitution (betad/s). Expression of these constructs in murine embryonic fibroblasts resulted in significant adipose conversion relative to those cells expressing wild type C/EBPbeta. C/EBPbeta protein content was increased markedly in both betadel and betad/s, which correlated with the acquisition of the adipocyte phenotype. Analysis of the betad/s cell line demonstrated a robust expression of C/EBPalpha coincident with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma expression. Total C/EBPbeta mRNA accumulation indicated no difference between cells harboring either the wild type C/EBPbeta cDNA or betad/s construct. However, cytosolic C/EBPbeta mRNA in the cells expressing the betad/s construct was maintained at levels between 2- and 7-fold greater than in the cells expressing the wild type construct. Alteration in mRNA half-life was not responsible for the increased accumulation. Mechanistically, these data suggest that HuR binding results in nuclear retention of the C/EBPbeta mRNA and is consistent with HuR control, at least in part, of mRNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W2054152075,"Proteinase-activated receptors 2 (PAR2) are expressed in kidney, but their function is mostly unknown. Since PAR2 control ion transport in several epithelia, we searched for an effect on sodium transport in the cortical thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, a nephron segment that avidly reabsorbs NaCl, and for its signaling. Activation of PAR2, by either trypsin or a specific agonist peptide, increased the maximal activity of Na,K-ATPase, its apparent affinity for sodium, the sodium permeability of the paracellular pathway, and the lumen-positive transepithelial voltage, featuring increased NaCl reabsorption. PAR2 activation induced calcium signaling and phosphorylation of ERK1,2. PAR2-induced stimulation of Na,K-ATPase Vmax was fully prevented by inhibition of phospholipase C, of changes in intracellular concentration of calcium, of classical protein kinases C, and of ERK1,2 phosphorylation. PAR2-induced increase in paracellular sodium permeability was mediated by the same signaling cascade. In contrast, increase in the apparent affinity of Na,K-ATPase for sodium, although dependent on phospholipase C, was independent of calcium signaling, was insensitive to inhibitors of classical protein kinases C and of ERK1,2 phosphorylation, but was fully prevented by the nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, as was the increase in transepithelial voltage. In conclusion, PAR2 increases sodium reabsorption in rat thick ascending limb of Henle's loop along both the transcellular and the paracellular pathway. PAR2 effects are mediated in part by a phospholipase C/protein kinase C/ERK1,2 cascade, which increases Na,K-ATPase maximal activity and the paracellular sodium permeability, and by a different phospholipase C-dependent, staurosporine-sensitive cascade that controls the sodium affinity of Na,K-ATPase.

Their ligand, tethered in their extracellular domain, is unmasked upon cleavage of their N-terminal domain by specific proteases (1Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). To date, four isoforms of PARs (PAR1–4) displaying different profiles of activation by serine proteases have been cloned. PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 are activated by thrombin, whereas PAR2 is activated by trypsin. PARs can also be activated experimentally, without proteolysis, by synthetic peptides that mimic their ligand domain. PAR1 and PAR2 are expressed in most tissues, where their stimulation is coupled to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) β and, secondarily, to that of various protein kinases C (PKCs), which often trigger ERK1,2 phosphorylation (2Fyfe M.

PAR1 has been involved in inflammatory cell-mediated renal injury in crescentic glomerulonephritis (9Cunningham M.A. Rondeau E. Chen X. Coughlin S.R. Holdsworth S.R. Tipping P.G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Rondeau E. Vigneau C. Berrou J. Nephrol. Dial.

PAR1 and PAR2 have also been shown to induce vasoconstriction and vasodilatation of renal vessels, respectively, thereby decreasing and increasing glomerular filtration rate (11Gui Y. Loutzenhiser R. Hollenberg M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F95-F104Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, whether they exert a physiological effect on epithelial cells function has not been established. PAR2 may be involved in the control of kidney ion transport because 1) it is expressed in renal tubule epithelial cells (5Bertog M. Letz B. Kong W. Steinhoff M. Higgins M.A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Fromter E. Bunnett N.W. Korbmacher C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 521: 3-17Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), 2) in many epithelia, including distal colon, pancreatic duct, and airways, activation of PAR2 induces chloride secretion through activation of calcium-dependent channels (12Cuffe J.E.

Investig. 1999; 103: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and 3) similar observations have been made in M1 cells, a mouse cell line derived from renal collecting duct principal cells (5Bertog M. Letz B. Kong W. Steinhoff M. Higgins M.A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Fromter E. Bunnett N.W. Korbmacher C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 521: 3-17Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It must be stressed, however, that the renal epithelium is a reabsorptive and not a secretory epithelium and that native renal tubule epithelia display neither chloride secretion nor apical calcium-sensitive chloride channels. Thus, we investigated the role of PAR2 in the regulation of solute transport in a native kidney epithelium and its signaling pathway. In preliminary experiments in rat kidney, we found a high level of PAR2 mRNA expression along the whole renal tubule. This study was focused on the rat cortical thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (cTAL), a nephron segment that avidly reabsorbs sodium via both the transcellular and the paracellular route. Transcellular NaCl reabsorption is primarily energized by basolateral Na,K-ATPase and generates a lumen-positive transepithelial potential difference (PDte) that serves as driving force for paracellular sodium reabsorption (17Greger R. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 760-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Thus, sodium reabsorption in cTAL was evaluated through monitoring of the PDte, the conductance of the paracellular shunt pathway and the activity of Na,K-ATPase. Signaling events were evaluated pharmacologically. Animals—Experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, L'Arbresle, France) weighing either 60–80 g for in vitro microperfusion experiments and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) measurements or 160–180 g for Na,K-ATPase assay and immunoblotting. In preliminary experiments, we found no difference in Na,K-ATPase response to PAR2 activation between the two groups of rats (data not shown). Animals were fed the standard laboratory diet ad libitum with free access to tap water. All experiments were performed in accordance with the French legislation for animal care and experimentation. Microdissection of cTAL—cTALs were dissected either from fresh kidney slices (microperfusion and [Ca2+]i measurements) as described previously (18de Jesus Ferreira M.C. Bailly C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 749-758Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or from liberase-treated kidneys (Na,K-ATPase measurement and immunoblotting). Kidney treatment with liberase (Blendzyme 2, Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) was designed so as to make microdissection of the large number of cTALs required for the different assays compatible with the preservation of PAR activity. Briefly, the left kidney was perfused in situ with 6 ml of Hank's solution supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes, and 0.015% liberase (w/v), pH 7.4. Thin pyramids were cut from the kidney and incubated in 0.006% liberase solution for 20–25 min at 30 °C and thoroughly rinsed in microdissection solution supplemented with inhibitors of protease (2 μg/ml aprotinin and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Preliminary studies showed that this treatment reduced PAR2 peptidic agonist-induced increase in ([Ca2+]i) by 65%, but nevertheless, allowed us to detect 2-fold stimulations of Na,K-ATPase activity and of ERK phosphorylation in response to PAR2 activation. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Intracellular calcium concentration was determined on single cTALs by the fura 2-AM fluorescence, as described previously (19Champigneulle A. Siga E. Vassent G. Imbert-Teboul M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F35-F45PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after isolation, each cTAL loaded with acetoxymethyl ester of fura 2-AM (10 μm, 1 h at room temperature) was transferred to a perfusion chamber and immobilized by sucking each end within the tip of a holding micropipette. The peritubular fluid maintained at 37 °C was continuously exchanged at a rate of ∼10 ml/min. After a 5–10-min equilibration, fura 2-AM fluorescence of ∼15 cells was measured with a standard photometric setup (MSP 21, Zeiss). Tubule autofluorescence was subtracted from the fluorescence intensities of fura 2-AM at 340 and 380 nm. Values were calculated as described previously (19Champigneulle A. Siga E. Vassent G. Imbert-Teboul M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F35-F45PubMed Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase Assay—Na,K-ATPase activity was determined using pools of 4–6 permeabilized cTALs by the previously described microassay (20Deschenes G. Doucet A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 604-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For determining the Vmax of the enzyme, total ATPase activity was determined in a solution containing 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm Na2ATP, and 5 nCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (2–10 Ci/mmol) at pH 7.4. For basal ATPase activity measurements, NaCl and KCl were omitted, Tris-HCl was 150 mm, and 2 mm ouabain was added. For determination of the sodium apparent affinity of Na,K-ATPase, cTALs were thoroughly rinsed in a sodium-free medium (100 mm choline chloride, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) after treatment with inhibitors and PAR2 agonists, and total ATPase activity was determined in a solution containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm Tris-ATP, 5 nCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP, and various concentrations of NaCl and KCl, the sum of their concentrations being maintained constant at 140 mm, at pH 7.4. Na,K-ATPase was taken as the difference between mean total and basal ATPase activities, each determined in triplicate. Values are means ± S.E. from several animals. Cell Surface Expression of Na,K-ATPase—The abundance of cell surface Na,K-ATPase α subunit was quantified after cell surface biotinylation, streptavidin precipitation, and Western blotting, as described previously (21Vinciguerra M. Deschenes G. Hasler U. Mordasini D. Rousselot M. Doucet A. Vandewalle A. Martin P.Y. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2677-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment with or without agonist peptide SLIGRL-NH2 (AP) (10 min at 37 °C), pools of 40 cTALs were incubated in bovine serum albumin-free microdissection solution containing 1.5 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) for 60 min on ice, and thereafter, the biotin was quenched with 0.1% bovine serum albumin solution. Tubules were lysed in HB solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)), and proteins were precipitated by 20% streptavidin agarose resin (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C in TLB solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). The agarose resin was washed thrice in TLB solution and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were denaturated for 15 min at 60 °C and separated on 7.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Blots were successively incubated with anti-Na,K-ATPase α subunit antibody (1/10,000, gift from K. Geering) and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (1/10,000, Promega). In each experiment, duplicate samples were run in parallel. The densitometry of the ∼100-kDa bands was quantitated by scanning and using the ImageJ software and normalized to cTAL length, and the mean value in AP-treated tubules was expressed as the percentage of that under basal conditions. Data are means from 4 experiments. Immunoblotting—After treatment, pools of 50–80 cTALs were solubilized at 90 °C for 5 min after the addition of 1 volume of 2× Laemmli buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare). After blocking in TBS-Nonidet P-40 (50 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing 10% low fat milk, blots were successively incubated with anti-ERK antibody (p44/42 MAP kinase antibody, Cell Signaling Technology, 1/500 in TBS-Nonidet P-40 + milk) and anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Promega France, Charbonnières, France) and revealed with the Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After stripping (four successive incubations in 25 mm glycine pH 2, 0,2% SDS buffer), the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with anti-phosphoERK antibody (phospho44/42 MAP kinase antibody, Cell Signaling Technology) and post-treated as above. Densitometry of the different bands was quantitated by scanning and using ImageJ software. For each sample, the densitometry ratio of phosphoERK/ERK was calculated, and in each experiment, these ratios in different experimental conditions were expressed as the percentage of the control group. Data are means ± S.E. from several experiments. In Vitro Microperfusion—cTALs dissected without liberase treatment were microperfused in vitro as described previously (18de Jesus Ferreira M.C. Bailly C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 749-758Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dissected tubules were transferred to a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope and perfused by a gravity-driven system at a rate of ∼15 nl/min. The bath flow rate was 12 ml/min to ensure a rapid and complete change of bath solutions, and its temperature was maintained at 37 °C. The PDte was measured at the perfusion end of the tubule via microelectrodes connected through an Ag/AgCl half-cell to an electrometer. In a first series of experiments, cTALs were perfused under symmetrical conditions. The bath and perfusate solutions contained (in mm): 118 NaCl, 23 NaHCO3, 1.2 MgSO4, 2 K2HPO4, 2 calcium lactate, 1 sodium citrate, 5.5 glucose, 5 alanine, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4 (bath continuously gassed with 95% O2, 5%CO2). In a second experimental series, cTAL were perfused in the presence of a NaCl diffusion gradient from the bath to the perfusate. For this purpose, the bath solution was unchanged, whereas NaCl concentration in the perfusate solution was reduced to 50 mm, and mannitol was added to achieve the same osmolarity. Statistics—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. from several animals. Comparison between groups was performed either by non-paired t test or by variance analysis followed by protective least squares difference Fisher's test, as appropriate. Expression of PAR2 in the cTAL—Because PAR2 are classically coupled to activation of PLC and calcium signaling, we attempted to demonstrate functional expression of PAR2 in the cTAL by searching for changes in [Ca2+]i induced by activation of PAR2. Basolateral addition of trypsin to cTAL dose-dependently and transiently increased intracellular calcium concentration (Fig. 1, A and B), with threshold and maximal effects observed with 0.15 and 10 nm, respectively. This effect of trypsin was related to its proteolytic activity since it was abolished in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Fig. 1B). It was mimicked by the PAR2-specific AP and its furoylated derivative (F-AP) but not by the reverse inactive peptide LRGILS-NH2 (RP) (Fig. 1B). Thrombin (1 μm), an agonist of PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4, was devoid of effect (data not shown). In the absence of extracellular calcium, the peak calcium response to trypsin was not altered (data not shown), demonstrating that it was accounted for by recruitment of an intracellular calcium pool. Following a first stimulation by trypsin, PAR2 was rapidly desensitized (data not shown). The addition of AP to cTAL increased almost 2-fold the phosphorylation level of ERK1,2 (Fig. 1C). Pretreatment with the specific PLC inhibitor Et-18-OCH3 (150 μm) decreased the basal phosphorylation of ERK and prevented its stimulation by AP (Fig. 1D). All together, these results demonstrate that rat cTAL expresses functional basolateral PAR2 coupled to PLC stimulation and subsequent activation of ERK1,2. Effect of PAR2 on Transepithelial Voltage—As described previously, in vitro microperfused rat cTAL displayed a lumen-positive PDte that spontaneously decreased with time (Fig. 2, A and B), likely due to progressive turn off of in vivo stimulatory pathways. When a steady rate of PDte decrease was achieved, at ∼0.07 mV/min (residual PDte = 8.3 ± 0.6 mV ± S.E., n = 30), the addition of trypsin (3–10 nm) to the perfusion bath increased PDte by ∼1.5 mV within 5 min (Fig. 2, A and B). Thereafter, PDte decreased at the same rate as spontaneously observed in time control cTALs. Consequently, trypsin-induced hyperpolarization remained almost constant for at least 15 min. In contrast, at a higher trypsin concentration (30 nm), the decrease was more rapid, and the PDte returned to time control level within 15 min (Fig. 2B). Like low trypsin concentrations, F-AP induced a stable hyperpolarization. The hyperpolarizing effect of trypsin was abolished by soybean trypsin inhibitor (Fig. 2, A and B). The hyperpolarizing effect of trypsin was not altered by BAPTA, which buffers changes in intracellular calcium concentration. It was also insensitive to specific inhibitors of all classical (cPKCs), novel, and atypical PKCs known to be expressed in TAL (22Aristimuno P.C. Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F624-F631PubMed Google Scholar, 23Silva G.B. Ortiz P.A. Hong N.J. Garvin J.L. Hypertension. 2006; 48: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Tsimaratos M. Roger F.

Inhibitors of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA and PKG), calmodulin kinase (CaMK), myosin light chain kinase (MLC-K), protein tyrosine kinases, and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (i.e. other signaling pathways triggered by PAR2 in different cell types (4Nishibori M. Mori S. Takahashi H.K. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 97: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) were also devoid of effect (Table 1). However, total prevention of trypsin-induced hyperpolarization of cTAL could be achieved with a low concentration of staurosporine (15 nm), a broad spectrum inhibitor of serine threonine kinases (Fig. 2D). Thus, trypsin-induced hyperpolarization of cTAL is not mediated by the classical PLC/Ca2+/cPKC/ERK-dependent signaling pathway but by a calcium-independent pathway involving an unidentified staurosporine-sensitive kinase.TABLE 1Effect of protein kinase inhibitors on trypsin-induced increase in PDte in microperfused cTALInhibitorConcentration usedTarget kinaseSensitivityEffect on try-induced increase in PDtenmnmStaurosporine15PKCIC50 = 0.7Full inhibitionPKAIC50 = 7PKGIC50 = 8.5CaMKIC50 = 20MLC-KIC50 = 1.3GÖ6850100PKCα, β, γ, δ, ϵKi = 10NoneGÖ69831,000PKCα, β, γ, δIC50 = 6-10NonePKCζIC50 = 60GÖ6976200PKCα, βIC50 = 2 & 6NonePKCμIC50 = 20H89500-1,000PKAKi = 48NoneH82500PKGKi = 480NoneML7 hydrochloride3,000MLCKKi = 300NoneAutocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide40CaMKIIIC50 = 4NoneU012610,000MEK1,2IC50 = 72 & 58Partial inhibitionGenistein25,000-50,000PTKIC50 = 2-6000NoneWortmanin100PI3KIC50 = 5None Open table in a new tab The addition of vasopressin (AVP), at a concentration that induces a maximal increase in PDte via activation of its V2 receptors and activation of PKA in rat TAL, increased the PDte by ∼2.5 mV. Subsequent addition of trypsin, during AVP-induced stimulation, further increased PDte, but only by 0.5 mV, i.e. to a lesser extent than trypsin alone (Fig. 3, A and B). Conversely, the addition of vasopressin during the plateau response to trypsin increased PDte by only 1.5 mV, which is less than the initial response to AVP (Fig. 3, A and B). This demonstrates a partial additivity of PDte responses to stimulation of AVP V2 receptor and PAR2. Because these two receptors are coupled to a different signaling pathway, the partial additivity of their effects on PDte suggests that these effects result in part from the stimulation of at least one common target. Effect of PAR2 Stimulation on Na,K-ATPase—Treatment of cTALs with AP increased the Vmax of Na,K-ATPase by >80% within 5 min, and this stimulation was sustained for at least 20 min (Fig. 4A). Stimulation of Na,K-ATPase Vmax was also observed in response to trypsin and F-AP, whereas RP had no effect (Fig. 4B), indicating that it was secondary to activation of PAR2. Furosemide, a specific and potent inhibitor of apical sodium entry in cTAL, did not alter the stimulatory effect of AP on Na,K-ATPase Vmax (Fig. 4C), demonstrating that stimulation of Na,K-ATPase is a primary effect of PAR2 activation and is not secondary to increased sodium entry, an event known to trigger targeting of cytosolic Na,K-ATPase subunits at the plasma membrane (25Barlet-Bas C. Khadouri C. Marsy S. Doucet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7799-7803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP-induced increase in Na,K-ATPase Vmax was not associated with any increase in the expression of Na,K-ATPase α subunit at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4D). In addition to its stimulatory action on Na,K-ATPase Vmax, AP also enhanced about 2-fold the apparent affinity of Na,K-ATPase for sodium, from ∼40 to ∼20 mm (Fig. 5A and Table 2).FIGURE 5Activation of PAR2 increases Na,K-ATPase apparent affinity for sodium in the rat cTAL.

This inhibitory action of Et-18-OCH3 was not related to a toxic, nonspecific effect since it did not alter cAMP-induced stimulation of Na,K-ATPase (data not shown). AP-induced stimulation of Na,K-ATPase Vmax was also abolished by blunting changes in intracellular calcium with BAPTA (10 μm), by inhibiting classical PKCs (PKCα, PKCβ) by GÖ6976 (200 nm) and ERK1,2 kinase by U0126 (10 μm) (Fig. 5, C–E, and Table 2). In contrast, AP-induced increase in sodium affinity was not prevented either by BAPTA or by GÖ6976 or U0126 (Fig. 5, C–E, and Table 2). It was abolished by the wide spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine (Fig. 5F and Table 2). All together, these findings demonstrate that PAR2-induced activation of PLC has dual effects on Na,K-ATPase in rat cTAL. Firstly, it increases its Vmax activity via a signaling cascade that includes increased intracellular calcium concentration, stimulation of PKCα/β, and phosphorylation of ERK1,2. Positive regulation of Na,K-ATPase by ERK1,2 has already been reported in the renal collecting duct (26Michlig S. Mercier A. Doucet A. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. J. Biol.

The majority of these tumors displays aberrant activation of the SONIC HEDGEHOG (SHH)/PATCHED pathway, triggered by mutations in the PATCHED tumor suppressor gene, which encodes a transmembrane receptor of SHH. In this study, we took advantage of the natural genotype (PATCHED+/−) of healthy keratinocytes expanded from patients with the nevoid basal cell carcinoma or Gorlin syndrome to mimic heterozygous somatic mutations thought to occur in the PATCHED gene early upon basal cell carcinoma development in the general population. PATCHED+/− epidermis developed on a dermal equivalent containing wild-type (WT) PATCHED+/+ fibroblasts exhibited striking invasiveness and hyperproliferation, as well as marked differentiation impairment. Deciphering the phenotype of PATCHED+/− keratinocytes revealed slight increases of the transcriptional activators GLI1 and GLI2—the latter known to provoke basal cell carcinoma-like tumors when overexpressed in transgenic mice. PATCHED+/− keratinocytes also showed a substantial increase of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1. These data show for the first time the physiological impact of constitutive heterozygous PATCHED mutations in primary human keratinocytes and strongly argue for a yet elusive mechanism of haploinsufficiency leading to cancer proneness."

Putrescine oxidase (PuO, 4The abbreviations used are: PuO, putrescine oxidase; MAO, human monoamine oxidase. 4The abbreviations used are: PuO, putrescine oxidase; MAO, human monoamine oxidase. EC 1.4.3.10) is a flavin-containing amine oxidase involved in polyamine degradation. It catalyzes the oxidative deamination of putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane) into 4-aminobutanal with concomitant reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (Scheme 1). In addition, the oxidase also accepts other polyamines, like spermine and spermidine, which are involved in cell growth and differentiation and interact with nucleic acids (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 2Medina M.A. Urdiales J.L. Rodríguez-Caso C. Ramírez F.J. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Chem. 1965; 29: 1148-1149Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 4Yamada H. Tanaka A. Ogata K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1965; 29: 260-261Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This enzyme (PuOMr) is a soluble homodimeric protein and is unique among flavoprotein oxidases in that the isolated enzyme appears to contain only one noncovalently bound FAD molecule per dimeric protein (5Desa R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5527-5534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PuOMr was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli (6Ishizuka H. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and is applied as a diagnostic enzyme for the detection of di- and polyamines (7Isobe K. Yamada H. Soejima Y. Otsuji S. Clin.

Increased levels of polyamines in tissue and body fluids are related to cancer and thus can be used as tumor markers (9Casero Jr., R.A. Marton L.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 373-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). PuOMr can also be used to monitor food freshness by detecting polyamines (10Inaba Y. Tokishita S. Hamada-Sato N. Kobayashi T. Imada C. Yamagata H. Watanabe E. Biosens Bioelectron. 2004; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Recently we identified a novel putrescine oxidase from the actinomycete Rhodococcus erythropolis (PuORh) (11Van Hellemond E.W. van Dijk M. Heuts D.P.H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PuORh shares 67% sequence identity with PuOMr and displays similar catalytic properties: it is highly specific for putrescine and is effectively inhibited by aliphatic monoamines and short diamines. Like PuOMr, PuORh is a homodimer of about 100 kDa and, interestingly, also contains only one mol of noncovalently bound FAD per mol of dimeric protein. Such a low flavin cofactor occupancy is remarkable as inspection of the PuO sequences suggests that each monomer contains a Rossman-fold domain capable of FAD binding.To explain the reason of the unusually low FAD/protein ratio in PuO, more detailed structural information would be highly informative. Unfortunately, no crystal structure is available for a PuO. However, for the sequence-related human monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), the crystal structure has been solved (12Binda C. Newton-Vinson P. Hubalek F. Edmondson D.E. Mattevi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). MAO-B is a flavoprotein oxidase located at the outer mitochondrial membrane (13Binda C. Hubálek F. Li M. Edmondson D.E. Mattevi A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and is involved in the oxidation of neurotransmitters (14Shih J.C. Chen K. Ridd M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The human oxidase shares 32% sequence identity with PuORh and catalyzes the oxidative deamination of aromatic monoamines like phenylethylamine and benzylamine. Based on the MAO-B structure we have constructed a structural model for PuORh (11Van Hellemond E.W. van Dijk M. Heuts D.P.H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By inspection of the model and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies, we have verified that one specific active site residue (Glu-324) in PuORh is crucial for its preference for aliphatic diamine substrates. Like PuOMr and PuORh, MAO-B is a homodimeric protein, but in contrast to both bacterial oxidases, each MAO-B subunit contains one covalently bound FAD cofactor. The FAD in MAO-B is covalently attached to a cysteine residue (Cys-397) viaaC8α-linkage.In this report, we describe our findings concerning a more detailed analysis of cofactor binding in PuORh. The data reveal that ADP is competing with FAD binding. Furthermore, we found that by merely mutating an alanine residue into a cysteine at an analogous position with respect to Cys-397 in MAO-B, PuORh is able to form a covalent cysteine-FAD linkage. This is the first time that a noncovalent flavoprotein is converted to a mutant enzyme that forms a covalent flavin-protein bond similar to naturally occurring flavin-protein bonds. These findings suggest that covalent flavinylation may have evolved to prevent binding of ADP or related cellular compounds.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Oligonucleotides were from Sigma-Aldrich. Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. E. coli TOP10 electro-competent cells were purchased from Invitrogen. E. coli ORIGAMI was obtained from NOVAGEN. Horseradish peroxidase was from Fluka. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Constructs were sequenced at GATC Biotech (Kostanz, Germany).Construction of PuORhA394C—To introduce covalently linked FAD, the mutant PuORhA394C was constructed by QuikChange PCR (Invitrogen). This mutation was inserted by replacing the GCG codon by a TGT codon using the following primers: puA394C_fw: 5′-GGACCCGCGGTTGTTACGCGGCGAGC and puA394C_rv: 5′-GCTCGCCGCGTAACAACCGCGGGTCC (mutated codon underlined). This resulted in pBAD-PuORhA394C.Expression and Purification of Wild-type PuORh and PuORh A394C—Expression of PuORh and PuORh A394C in E. coli TOP10 was performed as described before (11Van Hellemond E.W. van Dijk M. Heuts D.P.H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For expression of PuORh A394C in E. coli ORIGAMI, these cells were transformed with pBAD-PuORhA394C and cultivated in TB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 15 μg/ml kanamycin, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, and 0.4% (w/v) l-(+)-arabinose at 30 °C for 24 h. Purification of wild-type PuORh and PuORh A394C was performed as described before (11Van Hellemond E.W. van Dijk M. Heuts D.P.H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).ESI-MS Experiments—For nanoflow ESI-MS analysis of wild-type PuORh and PuORhA394C, enzyme samples in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, were used (final enzyme concentration 1 μm). For analysis under denaturing conditions, enzyme samples were diluted in 50% acetonitrile and 0.2% formic acid (final enzyme concentration ∼2 μm). Analysis was performed on a LC-T nanoflow ESI orthogonal TOF mass spectrometer (Micro-mass, Manchester, UK). All measurements were performed by operating in the positive ion mode and by using gold-coated needles, made from borosilicate glass capillaries (Kwik-Fil; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota) on a P-97 puller (from Sutter Instruments, Novato). The needles were coated with a gold layer, which was performed by an Edwards Scancoat six Pirani 501 sputter coater (Edwards Laboratories, Milpitas). Mass spectra were calibrated using cesium iodide in water (25 mg/ml).Preparation of apoPuORh and FAD Reconstitution—ApoPuORh was prepared at room temperature based on the hydrophobic interaction chromatography method (15Van Berkel W.J.H. van den Berg W.A. Müller F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Analytical Methods—All absorbance spectra were recorded in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C on a PerkinElmer Lambda Bio40 spectrophotometer. Measurement of PuORh A394C activity was done by using a coupled horseradish peroxidase assay as described before (11Van Hellemond E.W. van Dijk M. Heuts D.P.H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).RESULTSStructural Properties of Wild-type PuORh—To determine the exact molecular mass of wild-type PuORh, we analyzed the purified protein (2.0 μm) by nanoflow ESI-MS. Under denaturing conditions (50% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid), the enzyme is highly charged, which enables accurate mass determination. The mass spectrum of the denatured wild-type enzyme (□, Fig. 1A) shows one major peak corresponding to a mass of 49,254 ± 14 Da. This value agrees well with the theoretically calculated protein mass based on the primary PuORh sequence minus the N-terminal methionine residue (49,244 Da). The determined mass spectrum of unfolded PuORh confirms that PuORh contains noncovalently bound FAD: besides for a species that matches the primary sequence of PuORh, a species is also observed with a mass of 785 Da, which corresponds to one FAD molecule.FIGURE 1Mass spectra of wild-type PuORh and PuORh A394C.

Observed enzyme species are indicated with symbols and corresponding masses (open and closed symbols for PuORh andPuORh A394C, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By gel filtration experiments, it was already established that PuORh is mainly present as a homodimer of about 100 kDa (11Van Hellemond E.W. van Dijk M. Heuts D.P.H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it was found that only 1 mol of FAD was bound per mol of dimer. To further investigate the oligomeric state and cofactor content of PuORh, we analyzed the enzyme in its native form by native ESI-MS (16Heck A.J. van den Heuvel R.H.H. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2004; 23: 368-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The resulting spectrum reveals only species corresponding to dimeric forms of PuORh, while no monomers or other oligomeric states were observed (Fig. 1B). Three major dimeric species can be recognized: (⋄, 99,358 Da; ○, 99,714 Da, and ▵, 100,074 Da). Minor amounts of some other PuO species (3 kDa larger) are also present because of translation of PuO by E. coli using an alternative stop codon (11Van Hellemond E.W. van Dijk M. Heuts D.P.H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The three major and distinct dimeric forms are likely the result of variations in incorporation of the FAD cofactor in the monomers.A closer inspection of the dimeric species indicates that 36% is present as a holo dimer, containing two noncovalently bound FAD molecules (▵, in Fig. 1B), as its mass corresponds well to the combined mass of 2 apomonomers and 2 FAD molecules (785 Da): 100,074 Da versus expected 100,078 Da. The other two dimeric species, ⋄ (21%) and ○ (43%), do not correspond to any apodimeric form (one or no FAD bound) as the differences in mass between the three dimers are not consistent with FAD (360 Da instead of 785 Da). These observations suggest binding of only the adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) (427 Da) part of the FAD cofactor in these PuORh dimers. In fact, the species ⋄ (99,358 Da) corresponds nicely with the calculated mass of dimeric PuORh with two ADP molecules bound (99,362), while species ○ (99,714 Da) matches dimeric PuORh containing one FAD and one ADP (99,721 Da).FAD Reconstitution of PuORh—Because we observed that the ratio between the three different dimeric species was not constant for several batches of PuORh, we tried to saturate PuORh with FAD by incubating it with an excess of FAD. For this, 1.0 μm of PuORh was incubated with a 20-fold excess of FAD at room temperature for 6 h and subsequently incubated at 4 °C for another 12 h. ESI-MS analysis of this sample showed no change in the ratio of FAD/ADP binding. Incubation of PuORh with an excess of ADP also did not change the ratio in favor of the ADP-containing species. The addition of 1.0 mm ADP or FAD did also not influence the activity of PuO.Another explored strategy for increasing FAD incorporation in PuORh was to unfold the enzyme and then refold it in the presence of FAD. We explored several known approaches to prepare reconstitutable apoPuO (17Hefti M.H. Vervoort J. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4227-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Incubation of the enzyme in the presence of 1 m KBr did not result in any FAD release. Surprisingly, it was also impossible to unfold the enzyme and release the cofactor by using up to 6.0 m urea. This is in line with the observation that upon SDS-PAGE PuORh still contains FAD as evidenced by in-gel flavin fluorescence (11Van Hellemond E.W. van Dijk M. Heuts D.P.H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Only by using 6.0 m guanidium chloride was it possible to unfold the enzyme. The unfolded enzyme was subsequently separated from its released cofactors by using a desalting column. Unfortunately, incubation of the unfolded protein for 12 h in a 100 μm FAD containing buffer did not yield any flavin-containing enzyme. Another method for the preparation of apoflavoproteins is the use of hydrophobic interaction chromatography (15Van Berkel W.J.H. van den Berg W.A. Müller F. Eur. J.

By lowering the pH, it was possible to elute the flavin cofactor. The unfolded protein, bound to the phenyl-Sepharose, was then incubated at neutral pH with FAD to initiate refolding and FAD binding. When PuORh was eluted from the column, the protein fraction did not contain any FAD, which indicates that, again, proper refolding failed.Introduction of Covalent FAD in PuORh A394C—In a previous study we constructed a model of PuORh that is based on the structure of the sequence-related MAO-B (11Van Hellemond E.W. van Dijk M. Heuts D.P.H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In MAO-B, the FAD cofactor is covalently attached at the C8α position to the protein via a thio-ether linkage, involving Cys-397. Inspection of the PuORh model revealed that an alanine residue (Ala-394) is located at the analogous position, which precludes covalent binding of FAD at the C8α-position of the isoalloxazine ring (Fig. 2). To probe if we could create a covalent cysteinyl-FAD linkage in PuORh, we mutated Ala-394 into a cysteine residue. This mutant (PuORh A394C) was well expressed in E. coli TOP10. Whereas purified wild-type PuORh displays a yellow color, it was found that purified PuORh A394C has an orange color. This visual inspection already confirms that the mutation induced a significant change in the microenvironment near the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin cofactor. The UV/VIS spectra of both PuORh variants show a clear change in the absorbance features (Fig. 3). Activity measurement with PuORh A394C revealed that the enzyme is still active, albeit with a slightly increased Km value for putrescine and a significant decrease in kcat, resulting in a 20-fold lower kcat/Km value (Table 1). The loss in catalytic efficiency is likely due to a change of the position of the isoalloxazine ring compared with the wild-type, resulting in a less favorable positioning of the substrate amine group to be oxidized.FIGURE 2Active site of MAO-B and modeled PuORh. In MAO-B, the flavin is covalently attached to Cys-397 via a C8 α-thioether linkage. The model of PuORh contains an alanine residue at this position (Ala-394) which precludes covalent FAD binding. The figure was prepared using PyMol software.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Absorbance spectrum of wild-type PuORh (solid line) and PuORh A394C (dashed line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters of wild-type (WT) PuORh and PuORh A394C for putrescine at pH 8.0Kmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1s-1 mm-1PuORh WT8.2 ± 0.526.4 ± 0.53200PuORh A394C24.1 ± 2.93.9 ± 0.1160 Open table in a new tab Remarkably, precipitation of PuORh A394C in the presence of 5% trichloroacetic acid resulted in a yellow pellet and a yellow supernatant. When treating wild-type PuORh in the same way, the protein pellet was white. This suggests that part of the FAD is covalently tethered in the mutant enzyme while part of the FAD is still dissociable and released upon protein precipitation.To confirm the presence of covalently bound FAD in PuORh A394C, we analyzed this mutant by ESI-MS under denaturing and native conditions. The mass spectrum under denaturing conditions (Fig. 1C) reveals the presence of two species. The major species ▪ (85%) corresponds to a mass of 49,286 ± 13 Da, which agrees well with the theoretical mass of the PuORh A394C mutant enzyme minus the N-terminal methionine (49,276 Da). The minor species ★ (15%) has a mass of 50,071 ± 16 Da, which corresponds to a 785-Da increase in mass when compared with species ▪. This increase matches the mass of one FAD molecule and confirms that a significant portion of the FAD in the PuORh A394C mutant is covalently bound.Mass spectra under native conditions for the PuORh A394C mutant (Fig. 1D) show a similar picture as for the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1B): PuORh A394C is mainly present as a dimer, although a small amount of monomer can also be seen. Again, three different dimeric species (♦, •, and ▴) are observed that correspond to, respectively, the homodimer containing 2 ADP, the heterodimer containing both 1 ADP and 1 FAD, and the homodimer containing 2 FAD. No apoenzyme is observed. The distribution of these three different species (32% ♦, 40% •, and 28% ▴) is similar to that of wild-type enzyme.It was found that the extent to which PuORh A394C contains covalent FAD varies depending on the conditions used. Depending on the medium used (LB or TB medium), the level of covalent flavinylation varied between 10 and 40%. However, while the percentage of covalently bound FAD varied, no significant change in the ADP:FAD ratio was observed. The molecular basis for the different levels of covalent flavinylation may be related to e.g. a change in redox state of the cytosol, level of intercellular metabolites that affect protein folding, or the concentrations of cofactors, and remains to be established.DISCUSSIONIn this article we describe our findings concerning cofactor binding in putrescine oxidase from R. erythropolis. By ESI-MS experiments we observed that PuORh is present in three different dimeric species which contain: 1) two FAD molecules, 2) one FAD and one ADP molecule, or 3) two ADP molecules per dimer. These observations reveal that the unusual FAD/protein ratio of 1:2 for this flavoprotein oxidase is the result of competitive binding of ADP. It also shows that the enzyme is able to bind two FAD molecules per dimer while it was previously suggested that the dimeric enzyme could only bind one FAD. Binding of an FAD or ADP cofactor in each subunit is in line with structural model that has been build for PuO (11Van Hellemond E.W. van Dijk M. Heuts D.P.H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The model reveals that each subunit contains a single Rossman-fold domain, which is able to accommodate an ADP or FAD molecule. PuORh has been overexpressed in E. coli TOP10, which represents a different situation than expression in R. erythropolis. However, also for the orthologous enzyme PuOMr, a 1:2 FAD/protein ratio was observed when the enzyme was purified from its original host, M. rubens (18Yamada H. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 17B: 726-730Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Expression of PuOMr in E. coli also yielded a similar cofactor/protein ratio (6Ishizuka H. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This indicates that the partial incorporation of ADP, instead of FAD, in PuORh is not an artifact of heterologous expression in E. coli.The binding of ADP instead of FAD as cofactor results in a catalytically non-active species of the protein and thus prevents maximal catalytic efficiency. Our study shows that the ADP is tightly bound in PuORh as all attempts to increase the FAD content failed. This suggests that PuORh has a high affinity for both FAD and ADP. This represents a different situation when compared with another FAD-containing oxidase from a Rhodococcus species: i.e. eugenol oxidase. For this enzyme, it was observed that incomplete FAD incorporation leads to the presence of apoenzyme rather than ADP-containing protein (19Jin J. Mazon H.F.M. van den Heuvel R.H.H. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 2311-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that incorporation of ADP in PuORh is likely to be the result of a competition between FAD and ADP binding, both being present in the cytoplasm. Both cofactors are tightly bound by PuORh. The binding of ADP in an FAD binding domain is not unique for PuORh. In NikD, a flavoprotein involved in nikkomycin biosynthesis, significant amounts of ADP derivatives were found to be present in the isolated protein, instead of FAD (20Bruckner R.C. Zhao G. Ferreira P. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Binding of ADP leads to an inactive enzyme, as it replaces the FAD redox cofactor. Therefore, ADP acts as a regulator for PuO activity. This could be of physiological relevance. However, as ADP is always present in the cytosol, PuO would always be partially inhibited. The level of inhibition may depend on the metabolic activity as this will be related to the concentration of ADP.PuORh exhibits 32% sequence identity with human MAO-B and 30% sequence identity with human monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). In contrast to MAO-B and MAO-A, PuORh does not contain 8α-S-cysteinyl-FAD, because it contains an alanine (Ala-394) instead of a cysteine residue at the respective position (Fig. 2). Also in PuOMr and in other putative putrescine oxidases, an alanine is present instead of a cysteine (11Van Hellemond E.W. van Dijk M. Heuts D.P.H.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The soluble monoamine oxidase from Aspergillus niger (MAO-N) also contains an alanine residue instead of a cysteine residue and is known to contain noncovalently bound FAD (21Schilling B. Lerch K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In general, several roles can exist for the covalent linkage(s) between a protein and its flavin cofactor (22Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 23Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol.

Soc. 2007; 129: 16091-16097Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the effect of replacing the linking cysteine residue (Cys-406 in MAO-A and Cys-397 in MAO-B) has been investigated (30Wu H.F. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 888-893PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nandigama R.K. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20527-20532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These mutagenesis studies revealed that, while replacement of the cysteine prevents covalent FAD incorporation, the covalent flavin linkage is not essential for catalytic activity, neither for targeting and insertion of the protein in the mitochondrial membrane. However, it does play a role in the protein stability. Our observation that ADP competes with FAD binding in putrescine oxidase hints to another role for the presence of a covalent flavin linkage in MAO and sequence-related enzymes. By covalent tethering of FAD, the enzyme is assured of full incorporation of the flavin cofactor, outcompeting the (reversible) binding of ADP. Thereby, the enzyme can attain its fully active form. Such a pressure for discriminating between FAD and ADP binding can certainly be envisaged when considering the location of the human MAO isozymes: both enzymes are located in mitochondria and, as a result, are surrounded by relatively high amounts of ADP and ATP.To investigate if a covalent flavin link, as present in human MAOs, could be introduced in PuORh the mutant PuORh A394C was constructed. This mutant indeed contains for a significant part covalently bound FAD. However, most of the protein contains noncovalently bound FAD. This may be explained by the observation that in MAO-B the FAD-linking cysteine is involved in a peptide backbone flip (Fig. 2). Such an energetically unfavorably isomerization of the polypeptide backbone requires an appropriate protein microenvironment. The inability to facilitate formation of such a peptide backbone flip in PuORh may lower the efficiency of covalent FAD incorporation. Some more extensive enzyme redesign could alleviate this problem and may result in a fully covalently flavinylated PuO. Nevertheless, the observed formation of some covalently bound FAD in PuORh A394C shows that a covalent protein-flav"

AI/CIII/AIV/AV gene cluster includes some of the most important genes involved in lipid metabolism.

The human apoAI/CIII/AIV/AV gene cluster is located on chromosome 11q.23. The apoAI, apoCIII, and apoAIV genes are arranged in a 17-kb region in tandem, whereas apoAV is 28 kb downstream from the apoAIV gene (4Haddad I.A. Ordovas J.M. Fitzpatrick T. Karathanasis S.K. J.

The expression of the apoAI cluster genes displays distinct hepatic and intestinal specificity. ApoAI and apoCIII are expressed mainly in the liver and to a lesser extent in the intestine, whereas apoAIV is synthesized predominantly in the intestine and to a much lesser extent in the liver. ApoAV is only expressed in the liver (4Haddad I.A. Ordovas J.M. Fitzpatrick T. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13268-13277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports have demonstrated that the expression of apoAI, apoCIII, and apoAIV in the liver and intestine is controlled by the apoCIII enhancer, which is located at the -890/-490 region of the apoCIII gene (7Zannis V.I. Kan H.Y. Kritis A. Zanni E.E. Kardassis D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

Recent results showed that similar nuclear receptors (HNF4, RORα, FXR, and PPARα) could also bind to the apoAV promoter as well as to other apo genes (9Prieur X. Coste H. Rodriguez J.C. J. Biol.

As a key component of epigenetic regulation, histone modifications such as acetylation of histone H3 and H4 and methylation of histone H3 on Lys4 have been proven to correlate with the active chromatin structure. Histone acetylation and trimethylation of histone H3K4 (H3K4me3) usually denote active transcription, whereas dimethylated histone H3K4 (H3K4me2) has been characterized by modifications associated with a transcriptionally permissive chromatin (13Bulger M.

The local active chromatin modifications in the promoter region are necessary for recruiting the transcription initiation complex to activate transcription. Moreover, it has been shown that the intergenic regions between the locus control region (LCR) and the promoters of some gene loci are also hyperacetylated, forming an active chromatin subdomain (17Forsberg E.C.

Because the LCR is a complex and long range enhancer, it is interesting to know how the 400-bp apoCIII enhancer regulates the liver- and intestine-specific expression of the apoAI, apoCIII, and apoAIV genes but not apoAV at the chromatin level. In this study, we investigated chromatin modifications in the apoAI/CIII/AIV/AV gene cluster and the effect of the apoCIII enhancer in this process. We report that the apoAI/CIII/AIV genes form an extensively opened subdomain that does not include the apoAV gene, and the apoCIII enhancer regulates both the chromatin modification and the intergenic transcription of the apoAI/CIII/AIV region. Liver- and intestine-specific intergenic transcripts were transcribed bidirectionally with predominance from one strand, suggesting that there may be multiple transcription initiation sites in the chromatin template. Cells—HepG2, HeLa, and K562 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Caco-2 cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium with nonessential amino acids (Hyclone) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 1% sodium pyruvate at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.

The livers of 4–5-week-old transgenic mice were isolated and disrupted separately in phosphate-buffered saline to prepare a single cell suspension. After passage through a 21-gauge needle, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked immediately. The nuclei were sonicated to 100–500-bp fragments. The chromatin was immunoprecipitated using anti-acetylated histone H3 (06-599; Upstate), anti-dimethylated histone H3K4 (07-030; Upstate), anti-histone H3 (ab1791; Abcam), or rabbit IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz).

PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and quantified by Gene Tool software (Syngene). All of the PCRs were performed at least three times and averaged. RNA Isolation, RT-PCR, and Real Time PCR—HepG2, Caco-2, K562, and HeLa cells or the livers, the intestines, and the lungs of 4–5-week-old transgenic mice were used for extracting RNA. RNA isolation was performed by TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Takara) to remove DNA contamination. The RNA was then reverse transcribed, and control reactions without avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase were performed as described according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out on RNA samples from Caco-2, HepG2, HeLa, and K562 cells in parallel with identical control PCRs in increasing concentrations. Species-specific primers were designed in the exons of human apoAI, apoCIII, apoAIV, and apoAV genes.

The accession number is AC007707 Open table in a new tab Real time PCR was carried out on RNA samples from the livers and intestines of the intact and mutant apoAI gene cluster transgenic mice. Mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase acted as an internal control. DNA amplification was carried out in the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-time PCR System. Thermocycle was initiated by incubating the mixtures at 95 °C for 10 min to denature genomic DNA and to activate AmpliTaq Gold® DNA polymerase. This was followed by 40 cycles of two steps of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The fluorescence intensity was measured during the step at 60 °C. The primers used in real time PCR were I31–188, I43–158, I54–140, AV-76, CIII-62, and mGapdh-105 listed in Tables 1 and 2. Determination of Transcript Orientation—The orientation of the noncoding transcripts was identified as reported previously (25Ho Y. Elefant F. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 365-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of HepG2 RNA was reverse transcribed with strand-specific primers prior to PCR amplification with site-specific primers (Tables 1 and 2). PCR-generated cDNAs from the strand-specific analysis were separated on 1.8% agarose gels and then hybridized with 32P-labeled probes generated by the same sets of PCR primers from the BAC templates. Each band was quantified by Gene Tools software (Syngene). The apo BAC plasmid DNA was used as the control template to normalize the PCR efficiency of each primer set. Serial dilutions of the apo BAC plasmid DNA (80 ng to 0.08 pg) were assayed to determine the linear range for the PCR amplification. Because 0.008 ng of BAC template fell within the linear range of the RT-PCR signals from each primer, the RT-PCR signal levels were normalized to the PCR signal levels from 0.008 ng of apo BAC plasmid DNA generated with the same set of primers (C; BAC control) and were calculated in arbitrary units. Statistical Analysis—To compare the results between the apoCIII enhancer deleted transgenic mice and the intact apoAI gene cluster transgenic mice, the histone modification levels were analyzed by Student's t test. apoAI, apoCIII, apoAIV, but Not apoAV, Formed a Chromatin Subdomain with High Levels of Histone H3 Acetylation and H3K4 Dimethylation—The presence of histone H3 acetylation and histone H3K4 dimethylation in both the promoters and the intergenic regions in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells was detected by ChIP. The locations of the evaluated sites and primers are shown in the schematic map in Fig. 2A. The input DNA of three cell lines was normalized and verified by PCR gradient (Fig. 2B). All of the PCR primers used in this study were optimized to obtain appropriate PCR condition, in which the signals of PCR products were proportional to the amount of input DNA in the PCRs (Fig. 2C). HeLa cells without apo gene expression served as a negative control (Fig. 2D). Input DNA was used to calibrate the primer efficiency. Human histone H3 was used as an internal control (Fig. 2D). The ChIP results showed that the total histone H3 was distributed on the apoAI gene cluster with similar levels in all three cell lines. However, significant histone H3 acetylations were found in the promoters and the intergenic regions of the apoAI, apoCIII, and apoAIV genes, forming a hyperacetylated chromatin subdomain in both HepG2 and Caco-2 cells but not in HeLa cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2E). As to the apoAV gene, a high level of histone H3 acetylation was detected downstream from the transcription initiation site in HepG2, whereas a low level was detected in the apoAV nonexpressing Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, relatively low levels of the histone H3 acetylation were found in both cell lines at two intergenic regions: one site just downstream from apoAIV (I54–250 and I54–319) and a second in the middle of the apoAV-AIV region (I54–310). These results indicated that the apoAV gene was separated from the acetylated chromatin subdomain of the apoAI/CIII/AIV genes in the cluster (Fig. 2E). H3K4me2 was found through the apoAI gene cluster in both HepG2 and Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2F). In addition to the identified hyperacetylation sites, the intergenic regions of apoAV-AIV in both HepG2 and Caco-2 cells and the apoAV promoter region in Caco-2 cells were also characterized by high H3K4me2 modifications. These results are consistent with the reports that histone H3K4me2 is present on active or inactive (poised) genes (15Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 26Sims R.J. Reinberg D.

Gingeras T.R. Schreiber S.L. Lander E.S. Cell. 2005; 120: 169-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a much lower histone H3K4me2 modification site was identified downstream from the apoAIV gene (I54–250 and I54–319), and this was similar to the pattern of the histone H3 acetylation. This extremely low H3K4me2 modification site appears to be a boundary between apoAV and the apoAI/CIII/AIV genes (Fig. 2F). The apoCIII Enhancer Deletion Decreased Histone H3 Acetylation and H3K4 Dimethylation of the apoAI/CIII/AIV Genes but Not apoAV in Transgenic Mice—The results from cells showed that histone modification profiles of the apoAI gene cluster correlated well with its liver- and intestine-specific expression pattern. To test whether the apoCIII enhancer participates in regulating the chromatin modification, we performed ChIP assays on the liver of the apoAI gene cluster transgenic mice with low copy numbers (1 or 2 copies), including the two intact human apoAI gene cluster transgenic lines of T2 and T4 and the two apoCIII enhancer deleted transgenic lines of M3 and M4. The human apo genes exhibited an integrated position-independent and a closer approximation of copy number-dependent expression pattern in the intact apoAI cluster transgenic mice (12Gao J. Wei Y. Huang Y. Liu D. Liu G. Wu M. Wu L. Zhang Q. Zhang Z. Zhang R. Liang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12559-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the expression of apoAI, apoCIII, and apoAIV, but not of apoAV, was clearly decreased in the apoCIII enhancer deleted transgenic mouse lines (12Gao J. Wei Y. Huang Y. Liu D. Liu G. Wu M. Wu L. Zhang Q. Zhang Z. Zhang R. Liang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12559-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We compared the histone modification level in the liver between the intact (T2 and T4) and the mutant transgenic mouse lines (M3 and M4). As shown in Fig. 3C, high levels of histone H3 acetylation were restricted to the apoAI/CIII/AIV region, similar to that in HepG2 cells. One additional site (5Pn) located within 500 bp upstream from the apoAV transcription initiation site was analyzed (Fig. 3A). The result showed that the apoCIII enhancer deletion decreased the histone acetylation level in both the promoters and the intergenic regions of the apoAI/CIII/AIV genes (p < 0.05) but did not affect the modifications in the apoAV promoter (Fig. 3C). At the same time, the histone H3K4 dimethylation pattern of the apoAI gene cluster in transgenic mice was similar to that in HepG2 cells. The histone H3K4 dimethylation level in the apoAI-apoCIII region, but not in the apoAV promoter region, was also decreased (p < 0.05) in the apoCIII enhancer deleted transgenic mice (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the apoCIII enhancer mediates the extensive histone modification of the apoAI/CIII/AIV genes in vivo but not that of the apoAV gene. The apoCIII Enhancer Deletion Decreased the Expression of Intergenic Transcripts of the apoAI/CIII/AIV Genes in Transgenic Mice—The studies from gene loci with LCR have shown that there are correlations between the intergenic transcription and the extensively hyperacetylated chromatin domain (19Gribnau J. Diderich K. Pruzina S. Calzolari R. Fraser P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 28Gerber M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26303-26306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Using RT-PCR and real time PCR, hepatic and intestinal specific intergenic transcripts were identified on the apoAI/CIII/AIV/AV gene cluster in HepG2 and Caco2 cells, as well as in the livers and the intestines of transgenic mice (Fig. 4). The intergenic transcripts at 2 and 2.5 kb downstream from the apoAV gene (U5–342 and U5–224) were identified even in apo gene nonexpressing HeLa and K562 cells, suggesting that the intergenic transcription beyond the apoAI gene cluster has no hepatic and intestinal specificity. In addition to intergenic transcripts in the apoCIII-AI, apoAIV-CIII, and apo AV-AIV regions, we also identified one in the apoCIII promoter. Furthermore, the expression pattern of intergenic transcripts seemed to be in accordance with the distribution of dimethylated histone H3K4 in the apoAI gene cluster. To determine the role of the apoCIII enhancer in intergenic transcription, we compared the levels of intergenic transcripts in livers and intestines of the intact and mutant apoAI cluster transgenic mice (Fig. 5). It has been shown, by RNase protection assays, that the transcription level of apoCIII, but not apoAV, was lowered in the apoCIII enhancer deleted transgenic lines, M3 and M4 (12Gao J. Wei Y. Huang Y. Liu D. Liu G. Wu M. Wu L. Zhang Q. Zhang Z. Zhang R. Liang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12559-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we further confirmed these results by real time PCR. More importantly, we found that the expression levels of intergenic transcripts I31–188, I43–158, and I54–140 (located just downstream from the apoAIV gene) were much lower in the liver and intestine from the mutant lines than those from the intact lines (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the apoCIII enhancer also regulates the intergenic transcription in the apoAI/CIII/AIV region. Intergenic Transcripts Were of Biorientation with Dominating in One Strand—We used strand-specific RT-PCR combined with Southern blot to determine the orientation of these intergenic transcripts (Fig. 6). The BAC 286I4 containing the human apoAI gene cluster was used to normalize the cDNA quantity. Compared with the apoAI and apoCIII expression, the levels of intergenic transcripts were much lower (Fig. 6). Intriguingly, these transcripts could be detected from both strands. Each region analyzed showed a strand preference for transcription from one strand or the other, suggesting that these transcripts may have originated from multiple sites. We found that the exons of apoCIII and apoAI genes were also transcribed from both strands but predominated from the coding strand (Fig. 6). In this study, we investigated the role of the apoCIII enhancer in regulating the liver- and intestine-specific expression of apoAI, apoCIII, and apoAIV but not apoAV, at the chromatin level. Our results indicate that the apoCIII enhancer participates in modulating the histone modification and the intergenic transcription of the apoAI/CIII/AIV chromatin subdomain instead of regulating these apo genes separately. Meanwhile, the apoAV gene is not included in the apoAI/CIII/AIV subdomain. It is well established that the transcriptional regulation of the enhancer is mediated by the specific interaction between regulatory elements and transcription factors, as well as by the interactions among transcription factors. In the apoAI cluster, there are some important nuclear factors, such as HNF4 and Sp1, binding to the enhancer and each promoter of the apo genes. The apoAV promoter could bind similar nuclear receptors as other apo genes do in the cluster (9Prieur X. Coste H. Rodriguez J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25468-25480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Prieur X. Schaap F.G. Coste H. Rodriguez J.C. Mol.

Fruchart J.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1186-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results showed that the apoAV promoter activity increased about five times when the promoter was close to the apoCIII enhancer in vitro (data not shown). All of these observations suggest that the apoCIII enhancer may regulate the expression of apoAV. However, our previous data demonstrated that the apoCIII enhancer deletion had no obvious effect on the apoAV gene expression in transgenic mice (12Gao J. Wei Y. Huang Y. Liu D. Liu G. Wu M. Wu L. Zhang Q. Zhang Z. Zhang R. Liang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12559-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study ChIP analysis showed that, in the apo gene expressing HepG2 and Caco-2 cells, broad histone H3 hyperacetylations were found in both the promoters and the intergenic regions of apoAI/CIII/AIV, and this modification did not extend to the apoAV gene, indicating that the apoAV gene was separated from the apoAI/CIII/AIV chromatin subdomain (Fig. 2). The extensively acetylated subdomain in the apoAI/CIII/AIV region may make the chromatin flexible, thus providing the opportunity for interactions between the apoCIII enhancer and the apoAI and apoAIV promoters (29Li Q. Barkess G. Qian H. Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 197-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CBP/p300, the cofactor of HNF4 and Sp1, exhibits histone acetyltransferase activity, suggesting that the apoCIII enhancer could specifically recruit factors to achieve histone acetylation (30Suzuki T. Kimura A. Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Krumm A. Madisen L. Yang X.J. Goodman R. Nakatani Y. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). By comparing the histone acetylations of the apoAI gene cluster in the liver of transgenic mice, we found that these modifications were decreased significantly in the promoters and the intergenic regions of the apoAI/CIII/AIV genes, but not of the apoAV gene region, after apoCIII enhancer deletion (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that the apoCIII enhancer regulates the transcription of apoAI, apoCIII, and apoAIV, partially by maintaining an extensive histone modification pattern. The communications between the apoCIII enhancer and the promoters are conducted by physical interactions between protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA interactions, possibly via a looping mechanism (8Kardassis D. Falvey E. Tsantili P. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Tolhuis B. Palstra R.J. Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W.

Genet. 2002; 32: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Using a modified chromosome conformation capture method, we determined the spatial organization of the apoAI gene cluster and did not detect an interaction between the apoAV promoter and the apoCIII enhancer. 4Y.-J. Li, Y.-S. Wei, L.-J. Di, X.-H. Fu, D.-L. Hao, Z. Xue, H. Gong, Z.-Q. Zhang, D.-P. Liu, and C.-C. Liang, unpublished data. This confirmed the ChIP results that the apoAV gene was not included in the apoCIII enhancer-maintained chromatin subdomain. Note that although the apoCIII enhancer deletion dramatically reduced the expression of the apoAI, apoCIII, and apoAIV gene (12Gao J. Wei Y. Huang Y. Liu D. Liu G. Wu M. Wu L. Zhang Q. Zhang Z. Zhang R. Liang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12559-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it lowered the histone H3 acetylation and H3K4 dimethylation level significantly but less markedly (one-half to one-third). This indicates that other factors may participate in the chromatin opening process. Developmental associated intergenic transcription and extensively opened chromatin structure have been observed in the globin gene cluster (19Gribnau J. Diderich K. Pruzina S. Calzolari R. Fraser P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It has been verified in the human growth hormone locus that the intergenic transcription in LCR plays a direct role in the hGH-N gene expression (25Ho Y. Elefant F. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 365-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this study, intergenic transcripts of the apoAI gene cluster were detected specifically in the hepatic and intestinal cells, suggesting that they may participate in regulating the expression of the apo genes. Our data indicated that the distribution of intergenic transcripts was in accordance with the regions marked with H3K4me2. This result supports the idea that histone methylations may be involved in a process of transcriptional elongation (35Schubeler D. MacAlpine D.M. Scalzo D. Wirbelauer C. Kooperberg C. van Leeuwen F. Gottschling D.E. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Delrow J. Bell S.P. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Set1, a H3K4 methylase, is also a component of the RNA pol II elongation complex (36Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Thus, the transcriptional elongation process may provide more opportunities for transcription factors to bind to the intergenic region then to mediate histone modifications and open the chromatin broadly. Consistent with the ChIP data, real time PCR results showed that the deletion of the apoCIII enhancer clearly down-regulated the intergenic transcripts level in the apoAI/CIII/AIV region, confirming that the apoCIII enhancer regulates the whole apoAI/CIII/AIV chromatin subdomain. We found that the intergenic transcription in the apoAI/CIII/AIV gene region was bidirectional, dominating from one strand. These results were consistent with the observation from human growth hormone that the transcription in the LCR region was also bidirectional (25Ho Y. Elefant F. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 365-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This indicates that the promoters of apo genes are not the only sites for starting transcription. Previous data showed that the apoCIII enhancer had the potential to initiate transcription (37Kan H.Y. Georgopoulos S. Zannis V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30423-30431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study we identified a transcript at the apoCIII promoter. In the β-globin gene cluster, it has been reported that the intergenic transcription and histone acetylation is dependent on the HS2 enhancer (22Kim A. Zhao H. Ifrim I. Dean A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 2980-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The HS2 enhancer complex tracks along the intervening DNA, synthesizing short, polyadenylated, intergenic RNAs to ultimately loop with the ϵ-globin promoter (38Zhu X. Ling J. Zhang L. Pi W. Wu M. Tuan D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5532-5544Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because enhancers and promoters are active sites undergoing various chromatin modifications (39Mito Y. Henikoff J.G. Henikoff S. Science. 2007; 315: 1408-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the transcription initiation complex, including the transcription factors and RNApolII, may get access to multiple sites along an “open” apoAI gene cluster. Thus, the apoCIII enhancer deletion may reduce the recruitment of transcription factors to the chromatin domain. This would then reduce the initiation of intergenic transcription. It also reduces the histone modifications relative to chromatin opening. From the ChIP data, it is shown that H3K4me2 was enriched in the region with low H3 acetylation level, supporting the previous observation that H3K4me2 was the epigenetic marker for euchromatin (40Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). It was enriched broadly across active or poised chromatin (15Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 27Bernstein B.E. Kamal M. Lindblad-Toh K. Bekiranov S. Bailey D.K. Huebert D.J. McMahon S. Karlsson E.K. Kulbokas E.J. Gingeras T.R. Schreiber S.L. Lander E.S. Cell. 2005; 120: 169-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also identified an extremely low local H3K4me2 modification site downstream from the apoAIV gene. Note that the histone H3 acetylation level in the intergenic region of apoAV-AIV is low. This forms a relatively sharp edge of the apoAI/CIII/AIV chromatin subdomain, which suggests that a specific chromatin structure keeps the apoCIII enhancer from regulating the apoAV gene expression. Congruent with the histone modification pattern, a site characterized by palindromic AT-rich repeats has been identified downstream from the apoAIV gene. This cruciform structure, formed by self-folding, could mediate translocation (41Kurahashi H. Emanuel B.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2605-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 42Kurahashi H. Inagaki H. Yamada K. Ohye T. Taniguchi M. Emanuel B.S. Toda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35377-35383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We speculate that the special structure near the 3′ end of the apoAIV gene may insulate the apoCIII enhancer from the apoAV gene or hamper the tracking process from the apoCIII enhancer. Collectively, the apoCIII enhancer is involved in maintaining an active chromatin subdomain in the apoAI/CIII/AIV region. However, the apoAV gene is separated from this broadly opened chromatin subdomain and thus cannot be regulated by the apoCIII enhancer (Fig. 7). This study provides the chromatin level evidence that the apoCIII enhancer regulates the expression of the apoAI, apoCIII, and apoAIV genes but not apoAV. These findings shed new light on the mechanisms whereby the tissue-specific expression of the apoAI gene cluster is regulated and may provide new options for therapeutic intervention in dyslipidemia.
