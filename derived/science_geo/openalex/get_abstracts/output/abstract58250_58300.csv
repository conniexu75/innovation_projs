https://openalex.org/W2063124395,Cell-free culture filtrates of heat-labile enterotoxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli are capable of inducing morphological changes and steroidogenesis in monolayer cultures of adrenal cells. These tissue culture changes are simiar to those induced by cholera enterotoxin and cannot be effected by culture filtrates of other enterotoxigenic or enteropathogenic types of bacteria. The results of the tissue culture studies correlated well with those done in the standard intestinal-loop systems and suggest that this tissue culture system could be used to significantly aid epidemiological and molecular studies with heat-labile Escherichia coli enterotoxin.

However, nu/nu mice were incapable of rejecting allogeneic skin grafts for the duration of the experiment. These results argue against an active role of thymus-dependent immunity as a surveillance mechanism preventing tumor development."

Incidence in various ethnic groups varied in the narrow range of 0.4 to 1.9 per million population except among Jewish immigrants from Libya, among whom the incidence was 31.3 per million. An extraordinary excess of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease exists in this ethnic group."

https://openalex.org/W1583914850,"The antibiotic rifampicin has been used in an investigation of the temporal regulation of gene expression during bacteriophage T4 infection of Escherichia coli. We have asked at what times after infection the transcription of specific cistrons becomes rifampicin insensitive. Gene expression has been studied using analyses of proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels; thus translation has been used to assay for the appearance of specific transcripts. Two types of promoters account for most prereplicative transcription; early promoters are recognized immediately after infection, whereas quasi-late promoters are recognized only after a delay of 1frac12; min. Those transcripts previously defined as immediate early and delayed early RNAs initially appear to be under the control of early promoters; however, the quasi-late promoters may provide a second mode of regulation for several of those transcripts."

The finding suggests that cyclic neutropenia occurs because the hematopoietic stem cells are defective. Because of the similarity of human and canine cyclic neutropenia, it also suggests that the human disease may be curable by marrow transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1517551696,"Abstract The pyruvate kinase of Escherichia coli activated by fructose 1,6-diphosphate has been purified to homogeneity. It is a tetramer of molecular weight about 240,000. By electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, Sephadex gel filtration in denaturing solvents, and ultracentrifugational experiments, the monomer molecular weight is found to be 60,000. Tryptophan is absent from the enzyme and no free NH2 terminus can be found. Of several nucleoside diphosphates which act as phosphate acceptors in the reaction, GDP, judging by its Km value of only 0.05 mm, is the best substrate for the enzyme. Magnesium or manganese is required as a divalent cation, but the kinetics of activation by fructose 1,6-diphosphate is different, depending upon which cation is used in assay mixtures. The enzyme is inhibited by GTP at concentrations much lower than any other nucleoside triphosphate, especially when GDP is used as the substrate. Succinyl-CoA by itself inhibits the enzyme to a small extent, but in the presence of ATP it exerts a cooperative inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1607502387,"Abstract A which inhibits the in vitro effects of colicin E3 (E3) was purified from cells colicinogenic for E3 by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and Sephadex G-75. This protein could be isolated both from uninduced and mitomycin C-induced colicinogenic cells, but not from cells lacking the Col E3 factor. It is a highly acidic of molecular weight about 10,000. At concentrations approximately equimolar to that of the colicin, it completely prevents colicin E3 from inhibiting in vitro synthesis. Even in vast molar excess, however, it has no effect on the in vivo killing of sensitive cells by the colicin. Experiments to investigate the effect of immunity on inhibition of in vitro synthesis by colicin E3 are consistent with a model in which immunity interacts with the colicin to prevent its destruction of ribosomes. Preliminary direct binding experiments have failed to reveal interaction of immunity either with colicin or with ribosomes. However, highly purified colicin contains a component which co-migrates with immunity on sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide-urea gels."
https://openalex.org/W1627000734,"The Escherichia coli α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex contains a core, consisting of dihydrolipoyl transsuccinylase, to which α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (a flavoprotein) are joined by noncovalent bonds. The molecular weights of the three enzymes isolated from the complex are: α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, about 190,000; dihydrolipoyl transsuccinylase, about 1,000,-000; and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, about 112,000. Both the isolated α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and the flavoprotein exist in solution at pH 7.0 as stable dimers that contain two apparently identical polypeptide chains. Although the transsuccinylase core consists of 24 very similar polypeptide chains, only 12 of these chains contain a covalently bound lipoyl moiety. The subunit composition of the native α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is about 12 α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase chains, 24 transsuccinylase chains, and about 12 flavoprotein chains. Reconstitution experiments indicate that the transsuccinylase can bind about six α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase dimers (i.e. 12 chains) and about 18 flavoprotein dimers (i.e. 36 chains). However, nearly maximum activity is obtained when only about six flavoprotein dimers (i.e. about 12 chains) are bound. A possible explanation of these findings is that a systematic perturbation of the structure of the transsuccinylase has reduced its symmetry from 432 to 23 so that instead of one set of 24 equivalent sites for each ligand the transsuccinylase has two sets of 12 equivalent sites. The perturbation need not be a large one, and the binding energies of the nonequivalent sites could be different."

https://openalex.org/W1485449408,"Abstract Previous studies of the interaction of sugars with the membrane protein (M protein) component of the lactose permease system have employed an indirect procedure based on the protection of a reactive cysteine in the M protein against attack by labeled N-ethylmaleimide when certain sugars are bound. A method has now been devised for measuring the binding of labeled sugars to M protein directly, avoiding the use of N-ethylmaleimide. The particulate, membrane-containing fraction is equilibrated with 50 µm β-[3H]galactosyl-1-thio-d-β-galactoside (thiodigalactoside), in phosphate buffer containing 32P equal to the total count of 3H. The membrane fragments are then sedimented by high speed centrifugation, and, after careful removal of the supernatant (but without washing), the pellet is resuspended in a detergent solution and counted. The absorption of thiodigalactoside to the membrane fragments is revealed by an increment in the ratio of 3H to 32P. Control experiments show that 32P equilibrates with at least 95% of the total aqueous compartment of the pellet. The increment in the ratio of 3H: 32P is, therefore, not the result of the preferential filling of cell-free vesicles by the radioactive sugar. This binding reaction is not affected by energy poisons such as azide. Membranes from cells that have not been induced for the lac system and thus contain no M protein have no specific binding sites for thiodigalactoside as defined by this assay. The specific binding of thiodigalactoside involves a limited number of saturable binding sites. The value for half-saturation with thiodigalactoside is about 67 µm, in excellent agreement with previous studies of the affinity of the M protein for thiodigalactoside obtained with the indirect N-ethylmaleimide procedure. The site for binding thiodigalactoside (Site II) has also been found to have a surprising affinity for certain α-galactosides, such as p-nitrophenyl-α-galactoside, for which the Kd is about 7 µm. Other properties of the system are described. A procedure is described for the preparation and purification of tritiated thiodigalactoside."
https://openalex.org/W1591585495,"Abstract The amount and proportion of the multiple species of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase isolated from starved and cycloheximide-treated nonstarved yeast spheroplasts are similar to that isolated from nonstarved and untreated spheroplasts. In addition, there is no alteration of the biochemical properties and the pattern profile of the enzyme fractionated by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. On the contrary, nuclear RNA polymerase activities, i.e. RNA synthesis in isolated nuclei, are inhibited by the stringent phenomenon and by cycloheximide treatment. Both processes inhibit nuclear α-amanitin-resistant activities (polymerase I and III) as well as the α-amanitin-sensitive activity (polymerase II); the former are more inhibited than the latter. These observations indicate that RNA polymerases per se are not under regulatory control, but the binding of the enzymes to the nuclear DNA template is controlled by the stringent phenomenon. However, before affecting this binding, stringency produces inhibition of the rate of [5-3H]uridine uptake into RNA. Furthermore, the addition of cycloheximide abolishes inhibition (phenotypic relaxation), but not the restriction of the nuclear RNA polymerases. The lack of synchronization in the inhibition of RNA synthesis and nuclear enzymatic activities, and phenotypic relaxation suggest that starvation also controls the ribonucleotide polymerization process. Stringency produces an unequal inhibition of the synthesis of the different RNA species, and this is correlated with a similar restriction in the different enzyme species. Thus, there is more inhibition of rRNA synthesis and α-amanitin-resistant nuclear enzymes than mRNA synthesis and α-amanitin-sensitive enzyme. This correlation supports the assumption that α-amanitin-resistant enzymes (as a group) are involved with the synthesis of rRNA and that the αamanitin-sensitive enzyme is involved with the synthesis of mRNA. Stringency and cycloheximide have a similar effect with the nuclear enzymes. It appears that they limit the number of enzyme molecules bound to the nuclear template, thereby limiting the number of RNA chain initiations. However, they have an opposite influence on the rate at which [5-3H]uridine is incorporated into the RNA molecules. Stringency produces inhibition of [5-3H]uridine uptake and cycloheximide abolishes this inhibition. It is postulated, then, that RNA synthesis in eukaryotes is controlled by the interplay of at least two distinct factors. One controls the rate of the ribonucleotide polymerization process and the other, the number of enzyme molecules bound to the DNA template."

https://openalex.org/W1506579504,"Abstract At pH 7.5 and 25°, P-glycolohydroxamic acid is an effective inhibitor, competitive with dihydroxyacetone-P, of rabbit muscle triose-P isomerase (Ki = 4 µm) and yeast aldolase (Ki = 0.01 µm), enzymes which transiently form an enolate from dihydroxyacetone-P as part of their catalytic action. P-glycolohydroxamic acid is a poor inhibitor, again competitive with dihydroxyacetone-P, of rabbit muscle aldolase (Ki = 1,000 µm), which transiently forms a covalently bound enamine derivative of dihydroxyacetone-P as part of its catalytic action. It is argued that the first two enzymes are effectively inhibited by P-glycolohydroxamic acid because it can act as a stable analogue of the transiently occurring enolate derived from dihydroxyacetone-P."

https://openalex.org/W1537126120,"Abstract Colicin (E3) inactivates ribosomes both in vivo and in vitro by causing a specific cleavage of 16 S ribosomal RNA. A protein which prevents the E3-induced in vitro ribosome inactivation has been isolated from E3-colicinogenic cells and purified to a homogeneous state as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.7 and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 7.1. The purified protein (called E3 immunity substance) has no detectable phosphorus or carbohydrate. It is a very acidic protein and its molecular weight is about 9500. The amino acid compositions of the protein and its tryptic peptides were determined. There was good correspondence between the amino acid composition calculated from the sum of amino acid residues in the tryptic peptides and the amino acid composition of the whole protein, confirming the homogeneity of the purified protein preparations. The immunity substance was found only in extracts from cells carrying E3-colicinogenic factor (Col factor), but not in extracts from cells carrying other colicinogenic factors, suggesting that either the structural gene for the immunity substance is located on the Col factor or the production of immunity substance is controlled by a gene on the factor. This finding also suggests that the isolated immunity substance is responsible for immunity of E3-colicinogenic cells in vivo. Direct interaction of immunity substance with colicin in the absence of ribosomes has been demonstrated by experiments in which the immunity substance inhibited the reaction of anti-E3 antibodies with colicin E3. However, immunity substance does not irreversibly inactivate colicin E3. Other experiments suggest that the interaction of with immunity substance shows a 1:1 molar stoichiometry; 1 molecule of immunity substance neutralizes 1 molecule of E3. This could account for the immunity breakdown of colicinogenic cells by large excess of homologous colicins observed in in vivo experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1561670984,"Abstract Bacteriophage T4 DNA was used to direct transcription and translation in vitro in extracts prepared from uninfected Escherichia coli. The radioactive protein products of the cell-free reactions were examined on sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gels. We conclude that the cell-free system prepared from uninfected E. coli has the capacity to synthesize most T4 prereplicative RNAs and proteins. Furthermore, synthesis of those RNAs and proteins occurs in the same temporal order as occurs in vivo during the first minutes after T4 infection. The relative molar yields of early proteins in vitro are similar to the relative yields obtained in vivo. We found no evidence in support of the subdivision of early RNAs into immediate early and delayed early species; promoter recognition in vitro is followed by the elaboration of polycistronic mRNAs with no constraints against promoter distal transcription. A small class of prereplicative proteins was not synthesized efficiently in vitro. Those proteins are derived from the special class of prereplicative cistrons called quasi-lates; these genes in vivo are under the control of promoters first recognized after a delay of about 1½ min. The components required for quasi-late promoter recognition in vivo appear to be missing or nonfunctional in cell-free extracts of uninfected E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1585901589,"Abstract Six C→U transitions have been produced in yeast tRNA1val with 3.2 m NaHSO3 at pH 5.8 and 25°. The reactive residues are located at C17 (dihydrouridine loop); C37 (anticodon); C39 (anticodon loop); C72, C74, and C75 (near the 3' terminus). Of these 6 residues 2 are inactivation targets and 1 is located in the anticodon (C37). The position of the 2nd is still uncertain, but it is located near the 3' terminus at either C72 or C75. C→U transitions in either of these targets destroy the valine acceptor activity, measured under standard, in vitro assay conditions. The data demonstrate unambiguously that a C→U missense change (Val→Ile) occurring in the third position of the anticodon of yeast tRNA1val destroys its normal acceptor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1541820523,"Abstract Triornithine-resistant (TOR) mutants were isolated from several strains of Escherichia coli K-12. All of the mutants were found to be oligopeptide transport-deficient (Opp-). The dipeptide transport system (or systems) was not altered. The rate of growth of these mutants, the morphology of the cells and their colonies and the sensitivity to the phages T1, T4, P1, and φ80 were similar to the parental strains, indicating no dramatic changes at the cell envelope. All Opp- mutants tested showed 98% linkage to trp in sexual recombination, and 80 to 95% P1-mediated co-transduction frequencies. The opp gene is therefore the closest marker to the trp operon. A mutant with a deletion in the region att φ80, tonB, trp still contained the opp gene (or genes), indicating its appearance on the cysB side of the trp operon."
https://openalex.org/W2247096112,"Abstract The activity of initiation factor IF-2 from Escherichia coli strain MRE600 has been studied as a function of the presence or absence of the 50 S ribosomal proteins L7 and L12. Three specific aspects of initiation factor IF-2 function were examined: (a) the binding of radioactive initiation factor IF-2 to 70 S ribosomes; (b) the ribosomal binding of N-formyl-methionyl transfer RNA which is dependent upon initiation factor IF-2; (c) 5'-guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis catalyzed by initiation factor IF-2 in the presence of 70 S ribosomes. The results show that the binding of initiation factor IF-2 and of N-formylmethionyl transfer RNA are both reduced 50 to 75% when 50 S particles deficient in L7 and L12 are employed. The 5'-guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis activity is far more drastically reduced with particles deficient in L7 and L12. The latter effect is similar to results found with the 5'-guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis activities associated with elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu. The results suggest that proteins L7 and L12 are part of the binding site for initiation factor IF-2, but that they are more intimately involved in the 5'-guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis catalyzed by the factor. Furthermore, the results are consistent with a model in which the binding sites for all three factors, IF-2, EF-G, and EF-Tu, share certain common determinants, including the L7 and L12 proteins."

Carcinomas developed on 39 percent (1.6/41) of grafts from old donors and on 12 percent (5/41) of grafts from young donors.

https://openalex.org/W1588151656,"Abstract The electron carrier protein (P2) from Peptococcus glycinophilus, coupling the pyridoxal phosphate-related decarboxylation of glycine to the flavin adenine dinucleotide-mediated electron transfer to diphosphopyridine nucleotide, has been purified to homogeneity. Estimation of the molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis and by use of Sephadex G-100 gave values of approximately 12,600. The value based on amino acid residues is between 12,010 and 12,600. The protein contains 1 cysteine residue and 1 lipoic acid residue per molecule. Slight tendency for the monomeric form to aggregate into a tetramer having a molecular weight of over 48,000 was observed, but could be prevented by the addition of mercaptoethanol to the preparation. The electron transfer system exhibits high specificity for lipoate derivatives, i.e. α-lipoate, lipoyllysine, or lipoamide with the analogues 1,3-dimercaptopropanol, 1,2-dimercaptopropanol, and dithiothreitol being ineffective electron donors. Thioredoxin from Escherichia coli was unable to substitute for P2 in either the glycine decarboxylation-CO2 exchange reaction or in the electron transfer reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1567176461,"Abstract This study of galactose-induced transport in Escherichia coli K12 showed that in most strains two transport systems having the properties of galactose permease and galactoside permease are responsible for the observed transport. Several strains contain only the transport system but still grow normally on galactose. The regulation of this system was shown to be very similar to that of the operon. That is, it is induced by galactose, shows only a slight repression by glucose, and is under the control of the regulator gene. The only differences between the regulations of the transport system and that of the enzymes are the level of induction (4-fold for the transport system versus 15-fold for the enzymes) and the fact that the transport system is not under the control of the operator locus. The β-methyl galactoside transport system is not regulated by either regulatory gene in agreement with the work of Lengeler et al. (Lengeler, J., Hermann, K.O., Unsold, H.J. & Boos, W. (1971) Eur. J. Biochem. 19, 457–470). Galactose-binding protein is not essential for the activity of the transport system as there is no correspondence between the level of the two. In fact, the transport system is present at near normal levels under conditions where there is no measurable binding protein activity. Although the and β-methyl galactoside transport systems have different genetic loci and are controlled by different regulatory systems, they do not function independently when they are both present in the same cell. Rather, they interact in a complex way that results in the rate of transport by the β-methyl galactoside system being reduced at high concentrations and the Km of transport by the system being reduced 3-fold."

https://openalex.org/W1491234004,"Abstract Glutaminase A isolated from Escherichia coli reacts with the glutamine analogue, 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine, in two ways: (a) it catalyzes hydrolysis of the C5—C6 bond to yield glutamic acid and diazomethane; and (b) a group at the active site of the enzyme becomes irreversibly alkylated by the intact carbon chain of the analogue. The reactions are thought to occur through association of the compound with the substrate binding site followed by acid catalyzed attack of an enzyme group either at C5 to yield glutamic acid and diazomethane, or at C6, to inhibit the enzyme. The ratio of rate of hydrolysis to that of alkylation is about 70. Diazomethane was identified by observing that both the reaction product from diazo-oxo[6-14C]norleucine and [14C]diazomethane itself react with water and with benzoic acid to give labeled methanol and methyl benzoate in the same ratio."

The enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient (s020,w) of 16.4 S and a diffusion coefficient (D020,w) of 1.65 x 10-7 cm2 s-1. An average molecular weight was estimated to be about 1,000,000 from the sedimentation equilibrium data. The content of right-handed α helix in the enzyme molecule was estimated to be about 23% by optical rotatory dispersion and about 22% from circular dichroism spectra. The enzyme was found to contain 8 molecules of protein-bound lipoic acid per mole of enzyme; some other properties are also reported. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, lipoate succinyltransferase was dissociated into a single subunit with estimated molecular weight of about 48,000. This subunit was also seen on similar gels of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex or its subcomplex (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase-lipoate succinyltransferase). The enzyme was also dissociated into subunits with molecular weight 48,000 by gel filtration on Sepharose 6B in 6 m guanidine HCI. An average molecular weight of the dissociated subunit of the enzyme was estimated to be about 41,000 by the sedimentation equilibrium method in 6 m guanidine HCI.

In the presence of IF-1 and IF-2, we find that IF-3 (a) is essential for MS2 RNA-directed ribosomal binding of N-formyl[14C]methionyl transfer RNA in all cases and (b) stimulates the AUG-directed binding of N-formyl[14C]methionyl transfer RNA or the polyuridylate-directed binding of N-acetyl[14C]phenylalanyl transfer RNA with 70 S ribosomes but has no effect on the binding with 30 S or nonspontaneously associating 30 S + 50 S subunits. The results support the view that IF-3 is involved in formation of the 30 S initiation complex with natural but not with synthetic messengers. Stimulation by IF-3 of initiation complex formation with 70 S ribosomes, as directed by synthetic messengers, appears to be a consequence of its ribosome dissociation activity. Consistent with this interpretation is the fact that interference factor α (iα), which inhibits MS2 RNA-directed, IF-3-dependent initiation complex formation, but is without effect on the dissociation factor activity of IF-3, does not inhibit stimulation by this factor of the AUG- or polyuridylate-directed formation of an initiation complex with 70 S ribosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1436848078,"Abstract Glutaminase A of Escherichia coli is a tetrameric protein consisting of subunits of molecular weight 28,000. The subunits are apparently identical as judged by the observation of a single component on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and by the stoichiometry of binding of 6-diazo-5-oxo[14C]norleucine (DON) to the intact enzyme (3.7 eq per molecule). A highly cooperative conformational transition accompanies dissociation of protons from the enzyme with a midpoint at about pH 5.5. This transition can be observed by its effects both upon the kinetic behavior of the enzyme (i.e. in substrate saturation curves) and upon chemical reactivity, as seen in susceptibility to photooxidation. The conformational change has a half-time on the order of minutes under appropriate conditions. Substrates and protons bind only to one state of the enzyme so that hyperbolic substrate saturation kinetics are observed below the transition pH while sigmoid curves are seen above this point. Thus, protons act as positive heterotropic effectors. At nonsaturating levels the substrate analogue, DON, acts as a pseudohomotropic activator. The presence of covalently bound DON in some of the protomeric subunits of the tetramer stabilize the remaining protomers in the active (protonated) state at pH values above the normal transition point. As a consequence, substrate saturation curves are shifted to hyperbolic form and reaction of [14C]DON with the enzyme is promoted at pH 6, at which pH such reaction does not occur in the native enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1581164259,"Abstract DNA synthesis in an in vitro system proceeds by a covalent chain extension of the newly generated primers in the presence of Mg2+, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I or its large fragment, ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, RNA polymerase, and either single-stranded fd DNA or d(T)1000 as template. The synthesis is strongly influenced by the number of RNA chains and the kinetics of polymerization is nonlinear, showing a brief lag followed by a period of rapid synthesis before reaching a saturation level. However, a linear kinetics is observed when the number of new chain initiation is controlled (i.e. rifampicin added 1 to 5 min after RNA synthesis). A degradation of ribo-strands is observed during DNA synthesis. When d(T)1000 fully transcribed with RNA polymerase (1:1 hybrid) is employed as template-primer, both the whole enzyme and the large fragment of DNA polymerase I catalyze incorporation of dAMP residues. During the initial synthetic period there is a mole for mole degradation of ribo-strands by the whole enzyme. With large fragment DNA chain growth proceeds by a process of of strand displacement. In the initial synthetic period the 5'→3' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I attacks the 5' ends of the ribostrands endonucleolytically liberating 5'-triphosphate-terminated di- or oligonucleotides. Subsequent action of the nuclease activity proceeds exonucleolytically liberating 5'-mononucleotides as the DNA chain growth proceeds. The results suggest that the 5'→3' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase is capable of removing RNA primers from the final product of replication in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2336378104,"Abstract Galactose-diphosphoglycosyl carrier lipid (galactose-PP-GCL) synthetase, a membrane-associated enzyme, catalyzes the first reaction in the biosynthesis of the O antigen of Salmonella typhimurium LT2. The enzyme transfers galactose-1-P from UDP-galactose to phosphoglycosyl carrier lipid (P-GCL) to form GCL-PP-Gal, a lipid-extractable product. Nucleotide exchange, specific for UDP-galactose and UMP, is a sensitive assay for this activity. With isolated active membrane preparations, the extent of the exchange reaction depends on the concentrations of UDP-galactose and UMP rather than the concentration of available endogenous P-GCL. The exchange reaction follows pseudo-first order kinetics, with an apparent Km for UDP-galactose of 2.5 x 10-5 m. The presence of MgCl2 is required for optimal activity. The association of GCL-PP-Gal synthetase and the cell membrane is disrupted by some methods of mechanical cell breakage, and fully active enzyme is released into supernatant fractions of the cell. No activity was detected in the supernatant when lysozyme-EDTA spheroplasts were fractionated. One of the enzymes of cell wall synthesis, phosphoN-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase, remains membrane-associated regardless of the method of cell breakage. The translocase was shown to be localized on the cytoplasmic membrane using resolved membrane preparations of mechanically broken cells. This method of membrane resolution gave equivocal results for the localization of GCL-PP-Gal synthetase because of the release of a large part of the enzyme activity during cell breakage."
