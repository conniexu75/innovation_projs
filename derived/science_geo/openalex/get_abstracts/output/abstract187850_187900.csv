https://openalex.org/W2019843044,"Target-derived NGF promotes the phenotypic maintenance of mature dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptive neurons. Here, we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence for the presence within DRG neurons of endosomes containing NGF, activated TrkA, and signaling proteins of the Rap1/Erk1/2, p38MAPK, and PI3K/Akt pathways. Signaling endosomes were shown to be retrogradely transported in the isolated sciatic nerve in vitro. NGF injection in the peripheral target of DRG neurons increased the retrograde transport of p-Erk1/2, p-p38, and pAkt in these membranes. Conversely, NGF antibody injections decreased the retrograde transport of p-Erk1/2 and p-p38. Our results are evidence that signaling endosomes, with the characteristics of early endosomes, convey NGF signals from the target of nociceptive neurons to their cell bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2045210487,"Animals display stereotyped behavioral modifications during development, but little is known about how genes and neural circuits are regulated to turn on/off behaviors. Here we report that Drosophila neuropeptide F (dNPF), a human NPY homolog, coordinates larval behavioral changes during development. The brain expression of npf is high in larvae attracted to food, whereas its downregulation coincides with the onset of behaviors of older larvae, including food aversion, hypermobility, and cooperative burrowing. Loss of dNPF signaling in young transgenic larvae led to the premature display of behavioral phenotypes associated with older larvae. Conversely, dNPF overexpression in older larvae prolonged feeding, and suppressed hypermobility and cooperative burrowing behaviors. The dNPF system provides a new paradigm for studying the central control of cooperative behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2027846728,"ON and OFF pathways separately relay increment and decrement luminance signals from retinal bipolar cells to cortex. ON-OFF retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are activated via synaptic inputs onto bistratified dendrites localized in the ON and OFF regions of the inner plexiform layer. Postnatal maturational processes convert bistratifying ON-OFF RGCs to monostratifying ON and OFF RGCs. Although visual deprivation influences refinement of higher visual centers, no previous studies suggest that light regulates either the development of the visual-evoked signaling in retinal ON and OFF pathways, nor pruning of bistratified RGC dendrites. We find that dark rearing blocks both the maturational loss of ON-OFF responsive RGCs and the pruning of dendrites. Thus, in retina, there is a previously unrecognized, pathway-specific maturation that is profoundly affected by visual deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2011964190,"Neurons of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are spontaneously active. By voltage clamping dissociated rat STN neurons with their own firing patterns, we found that pacemaking is driven by two kinds of subthreshold sodium current: a steady-state ""persistent"" sodium current and a dynamic ""resurgent"" sodium current, which promotes rapid firing by flowing immediately after a spike. These currents are strongly regulated by a process of slow inactivation that is active at physiological firing frequencies. Slow inactivation of the pacemaking sodium currents promotes a constant frequency of tonic firing in the face of small, steady changes in input and constitutes a form of adaptation at the single-cell level. Driving cells at a high rate (75 Hz) produced pronounced slow inactivation (60%-70%) of resurgent, persistent, and transient components of sodium current. This inactivation is likely to contribute to effects of clinical deep-brain stimulation on STN excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2056366478,"The AMPA glutamate receptor (AMPAR) subunits GluR2 and GluR3 are thought to be important for synaptic targeting/stabilization of AMPARs and the expression of hippocampal long-term depression (LTD). In order to address this hypothesis genetically, we generated and analyzed knockout mice deficient in the expression of both GluR2 and GluR3. We show here that the double knockout mice are severely impaired in basal synaptic transmission, demonstrating that GluR2/3 are essential to maintain adequate synaptic transmission in vivo. However, these mutant mice are competent in establishing several forms of long-lasting synaptic changes in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, including LTD, long-term potentiation (LTP), depotentiation, and dedepression, indicating the presence of GluR2/3-independent mechanisms of LTD expression and suggesting that AMPA receptor GluR1 alone is capable of various forms of synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1997413420,"L-type Ca(2+) channels possess a Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI) mechanism, affording feedback in diverse neurobiological settings and serving as prototype for unconventional calmodulin (CaM) regulation emerging in many Ca(2+) channels. Crucial to such regulation is the preassociation of Ca(2+)-free CaM (apoCaM) to channels, facilitating rapid triggering of CDI as Ca(2+)/CaM shifts to a channel IQ site (IQ). Progress has been hindered by controversy over the preassociation site, as identified by in vitro assays. Most critical has been the failure to resolve a functional signature of preassociation. Here, we deploy novel FRET assays in live cells to identify a 73 aa channel segment, containing IQ, as the critical preassociation pocket. IQ mutations disrupting preassociation revealed accelerated voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) as the functional hallmark of channels lacking preassociated CaM. Hence, the alpha(1C) IQ segment is multifunctional-serving as ligand for preassociation and as Ca(2+)/CaM effector site for CDI."
https://openalex.org/W2092800106,"It is frequently argued that both amyloid beta (Abeta) and oxidative stress are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We show here that clonal nerve cell lines and primary cortical neurons that are resistant to Abeta toxicity have an enhanced flux of glucose through both the glycolytic pathway and the hexose monophosphate shunt. AD brain also has increased enzymatic activities in both pathways relative to age-matched controls. The Abeta-induced changes in glucose metabolism are due to the activation of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). As a result of Abeta-induced changes in glucose metabolism, Abeta-resistant cells are more readily killed by glucose starvation and by classes of antipsychotic drugs that inhibit glucose uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2106765135,"The mechanism by which target-derived Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) signaling is propagated retrogradely, over extremely long distances, to cell bodies to support survival of neurons is unclear. Here we show that survival of sympathetic neurons supported by NGF on distal axons requires the kinase activity of the NGF receptor, TrkA, in both distal axons and cell bodies. In contrast, disruption of TrkA activity exclusively in proximal axonal segments affects neither retrograde NGF-TrkA signaling in cell bodies nor neuronal survival. Ligand-receptor internalization is necessary for survival of neurons supported by NGF on distal axons. Furthermore, antibody neutralization experiments indicate that retrogradely transported NGF, within cell bodies, is critical for neuronal survival but not for growth of distal axons. Taken together, our results indicate that retrogradely transported NGF-TrkA complexes promote sympathetic neuron survival."

https://openalex.org/W2026461867,"As a means to automate the three-dimensional histological analysis of brain tissue, we demonstrate the use of femtosecond laser pulses to iteratively cut and image fixed as well as fresh tissue. Cuts are accomplished with 1 to 10 μJ pulses to ablate tissue with micron precision. We show that the permeability, immunoreactivity, and optical clarity of the tissue is retained after pulsed laser cutting. Further, samples from transgenic mice that express fluorescent proteins retained their fluorescence to within microns of the cut surface. Imaging of exogenous or endogenous fluorescent labels down to 100 μm or more below the cut surface is accomplished with 0.1 to 1 nJ pulses and conventional two-photon laser scanning microscopy. In one example, labeled projection neurons within the full extent of a neocortical column were visualized with micron resolution. In a second example, the microvasculature within a block of neocortex was measured and reconstructed with micron resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2112018994,"The human cartilage glycoprotein-39 (HCgp-39 or YKL40) is expressed by synovial cells and macrophages during inflammation. Its precise physiological role is unknown. However, it has been proposed that HCgp-39 acts as an autoantigen in rheumatoid arthritis, and high expression levels have been associated with cancer development. HCgp-39 shares high sequence homology with family 18 chitinases, and although it binds to chitin it lacks enzymatic activity. The crystal structure of HCgp-39 shows that the protein displays a (β/α)8-barrel fold with an insertion of an α + β domain. A 43-Å long carbohydrate-binding cleft is present at the C-terminal side of the β-strands in the (β/α)8 barrel. Binding of chitin fragments of different lengths identified nine sugar-binding subsites in the groove. Protein-carbohydrate interactions are mainly mediated by stacking of side chains of aromatic amino acid residues. Surprisingly, the specificity of chitin binding to HCgp-39 depends on the length of the oligosaccharide. Although chitin disaccharides tend to occupy the distal subsites, longer chains bind preferably to the central subsites in the groove. Despite the absence of enzymatic activity, long chitin fragments are distorted upon binding, with the GlcNAc at subsite –1 in a boat conformation, similar to what has been observed in chitinases. The presence of chitin in the human body has never been documented so far.

It is characterized by inflammation of synovial tissues causing joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. At the moment, there is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, and therefore current treatments focus on relieving the pain and inflammation and on stopping joint destruction. A better understanding of how rheumatoid arthritis affects the body may help to design and develop efficient treatments. Some of the most promising areas of research for the abatement of RA include oral tolerance therapy and the use of monoclonal antibodies and drugs to block the activity of interleukins, neutrophils, and T-cells (1Firestein G.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar).The human cartilage glycoprotein-39 (HCgp-39 or YKL40) is a candidate autoantigen in RA having the capability to induce T-cell-mediated autoimmune response (2Verheijden G.F.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that HCgp-39-derived peptides can induce immunologic tolerance in patients with persistent RA (5Kavanaugh A. Genovese M. Baughman J. Kivitz A. Bulpitt K. Olsen N.

Increased levels of HCgp-39 have been detected in the blood of RA patients (8Johansen J.S. Kirwan J.R. Price P.A. Sharif M. Scand. J.

Based on these findings it has been suggested that HCgp-39 could be used as a clinical marker for early detection of disease activity and for testing the effectiveness of therapy (17Peltomaa R. Paimela L. Harvey S. Helve T. Leirisalo Repo M. Rheumatol. Int. 2001; 20: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The precise physiological function of HCgp-39 is unknown. However, it has been demonstrated recently that HCgp-39 stimulates cell proliferation of connective tissue acting synergistically with the insulin-like growth factor 1 (18Recklies A.D. White C.

Based on amino acid sequence and structure relationships all of these proteins have been grouped in glycoside hydrolase family 18, which also includes bacterial and plant chitinases (25Henrissat B.

These mammalian chitinase-like proteins (CLPs), which lack catalytic activity, could function as lectins able to recognize specific glycan structures present in mammalian tissues. Crystal structures of CLPs have confirmed a high degree of structure similarity to the family 18 chitinases (27Mohanty A.K. Singh G. Paramasivam K. Jabeen T. Sharma S. Yadav S. Kaur P. Kumar P.

Surprisingly, the HCgp-39 interacts distinctly differently with short and long chitin fragments.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystallization and Heavy Atom Derivative Search—Recombinant HCgp-39, produced by a Chinese hamster ovary transfectant and purified to homogeneity via cation exchange chromatography, immunochromatography, and size exclusion chromatography, was kindly provided by NV Organon, Oss, The Netherlands.HCgp-39 was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method. The protein solution contained 4 mg/ml HCgp-39 in 1 m NaCl, 10 mm BES buffer, pH 7.5. The precipitant consisted of 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.5 m NaCl in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.1. The crystals grew to a maximum size of 0.8 × 0.15 × 0.2 mm3. They belong to space group P43 with 4 molecules in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of ∼50%. HCgp-39 crystals, which were briefly soaked in a solution of 10% glycerol in mother liquor and then flash-frozen, diffracted to a resolution of 2.6 Å using synchrotron radiation. Subsequently, improved diffraction could be obtained by avoiding glycerol in the cryoprotectant solution. Instead, the HCgp-39 crystals were stabilized in 35% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, or 20 mm BES buffer, pH 7.5, for a few hours and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.Heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking the crystals for 3 days in solutions of mother liquor containing 3 mm heavy atom compound. Among the over 20 different heavy atom compounds tested, 10 gave acceptable diffraction but only 4 could be used as isomorphous derivatives. The complex structures were obtained by soaking HCgp-39 crystals in the presence of 5–10 mm chitin oligosaccharides (GlcNAc2, GlcNAc4, GlcNAc5) in 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm BES-NaOH, pH 8.0, for about 15 h at room temperature.Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data for the native data set were collected at the ELETTRA Synchrotron, Trieste, Italy. To attempt structure determination by the MAD method, data on the (C2H5)3HgPO4 derivative was collected at beamline BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, with the wavelengths tuned to λ1 = 1.005 Å and λ2 = 0.775 Å (Table I). The other derivative data sets were collected at beamline X31 at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory outstation at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany, with the wavelength tuned to λ = 0.99 Å, which, although not optimal, allowed the detection of the anomalous signal of the cis-Pt(NH3)2Cl2 derivative (Table I). X-ray diffraction data on HCgp-39 crystals soaked with (GlcNAc)5 were collected in-house on an ENRAF-Nonius CuKα rotating anode generator equipped with a MacScience DIP2030 image plate detector. Data on (GlcNAc)4- and (GlcNAc)2-complexed HCgp-39 were collected at the ESRF, Grenoble, at beamlines ID14–1 and ID14–2, respectively. All data were integrated and merged using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). Programs from the CCP4 suite (31Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—Heavy atom position search, parameter refinement, and phases were calculated with programs from the PHASES package (32Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 277: 590-620Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The anomalous data were included in the calculations. The initial phases had a figure of merit of 0.40. Next, the non-crystallographic symmetry operators were determined by manual superposition of the heavy atom sites and refined with the program IMP of the O package (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). The program DM (34Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) was used to improve the initial phases by applying solvent flattening, histogram matching, and 4-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. The final figure of merit was 0.70 for data to 3.0 Å. The obtained electron density map could be interpreted unambiguously, and all residues from positions 22 to 383 could be placed in electron density. The model was built with the program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). Refinement was performed with the program CNS (Crystallography & NMR System) (35Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). 10% of the reflections, selected in very thin resolution shells, was set aside for R free factor calculations. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed throughout the whole refinement procedure. Bulk solvent correction and overall anisotropic B-factor corrections were included from the beginning resulting in an R factor of 23.5% and R free of 25.8%. Incorporation of experimental phase information during refinement resulted in improved R factor and R free values of 21.6 and 24.0%, respectively, for data to 2.6 Å. The final model consists of 4 × 362 residues, 4 × 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues (N-linked glycosylation), and a total of 117 water molecules. The stereochemical quality was assessed with the program PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are given in Table II.The structures of HCgp-39 in complex with chitin fragments were solved by standard methods starting from the coordinates of the native HCgp-39 structure determined at 2.6 Å resolution. To optimize the position of the 4 molecules in the asymmetric unit a three-dimensional rigid body refinement of the native HCgp-39 model was performed using data up to 3.5 Å. Subsequently the model was adjusted using a round of simulated annealing. At this stage the electron density corresponding to the soaked ligands was visible in the chitin-binding groove from both 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc Fourier maps. The refinement, carried out with the program CNS (Crystallography & NMR System) (35Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar), was followed by monitoring the behavior of the free R factor calculated from 10% of the data. The β(1, 4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues were fitted in the electron density using the program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). After a few rounds of x-ray-restrained energy minimization followed by B-factor refinement, water molecules were added. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were kept for the protein core throughout the whole refinement procedure. Refinement statistics are reported in Table II. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the protein data bank with entry codes 1NWR, 1NWS, 1NWT, and 1NWU.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA recombinant glycosylated form of the human cartilage glycoprotein-39 was crystallized. The structure was determined using the multiple isomorphous replacement method supplemented with anomalous scattering from three heavy atom derivatives (Table II). The native structure of HCgp-39 was determined at 2.6 Å. The final model comprises 4 HCgp-39 monomers (residues 22–383) and 117 water molecules. The 4 crystallographically independent molecules are essentially identical, having a root mean square difference of 0.02 Å for 361 equivalent Cα atoms. In a Ramachandran plot 91.4% of the 1252 non-glycine and non-proline residues are in the most favored regions, 8.0% lie in the additional allowed sections, and the remaining 0.6% in the generously allowed parts.In the crystal structure of HCgp-39 the first 21 N-terminal residues that form the leader sequence are not present. Disulfide bonds are formed between Cys26 and Cys51 and between Cys300 and Cys364. Three cis peptide bonds are present (residues Ser57-Phe58, Leu140-Tyr141, and Trp352-Ala353). It is noteworthy that two of them are located in the sugar-binding groove and that all three cis peptide bonds have been found in corresponding positions in the structures of other family 18 glycosylhydrolases (37van Aalten D.M. Synstad B. Brurberg M.B. Hough E. Riise B.W. Eijsink V.G. Wierenga R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5842-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 38Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z.

Beintema J.J. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1181-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). HCgp-39 is N-glycosylated at Asn60 and 2 β(1, 4)-linked GlcNAc residues were clearly visible in the electron density. Inspection of the electron density map revealed a sequence mismatch at position 311 where an isoleucine residue is present instead of the threonine expected from the deposited amino acid sequence (Swiss-Prot P36222). The sequence mismatch has been identified in all four HCgp-39 molecules in the asymmetric unit, and it has been verified by mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown).Protein Structure—HCgp-39 has approximate dimensions of 54 × 40 × 44 Å, and it displays the typical fold of family 18 glycosylhydrolases (25Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Its three-dimensional structure (Fig. 1) consists of an eight-stranded β/α-barrel domain with a second domain, composed of six antiparallel β-strands and one α-helix (α + β domain), inserted after strand β7. Superpositions of HCgp-39 with the bacterial chitinases ChiA and ChiB (37van Aalten D.M. Synstad B. Brurberg M.B. Hough E. Riise B.W. Eijsink V.G. Wierenga R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5842-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 38Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z. Oppenheim A.B. Chet I. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Structure. 1994; 2: 1169-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) result in root mean square differences of 1.54 and 1.46 Å for 330 and 321 equivalent Cα pairs, respectively. The N-terminal fibronectin III-module domain and the C-terminal chitin-binding domain found in ChiA and ChiB, respectively, are absent in HCgp-39.Carbohydrate Binding—A distinguishing feature of HCgp-39 is its ability to bind to insoluble chitin (40Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Au F.L. Donker-Koopman W.E. Strijland A. Muijsers A.O. Hrebicek M. Aerts J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). By soaking HCgp-39 crystals in the presence of chitin fragments we could determine the structures of HCgp-39 in complex with (Glc-NAc)2, (GlcNAc)4, and (GlcNAc)5 (Table II, Fig. 2). These structures allowed the identification of 9 sugar-binding subsites in the 43 Å groove, across the C-terminal ends of the β-strands of the (β/α)8 barrel. They were numbered from –6 to +3 from the non-reducing end, as is the current convention (41Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), with the –1 and +1 subsites corresponding to the ones immediately upstream and downstream from the scissile bond in chitinases (Figs. 2 and 3). The carbohydrate-binding groove of HCgp-39 is lined with aromatic residues, which have hydrophobic stacking interactions with the hydrophobic sides of the bound sugar rings (Fig. 3). Among them, Trp99 and Trp352 additionally participate in ligand recognition by making hydrogen bonds with the C3-OH of the –1 GlcNAc and the C7-O of the –2 GlcNAc, respectively. The α + β domain also takes part in sugar binding, with Arg263 making hydrogen bonding interactions with the C6-OH of the –1 GlcNAc. Specific recognition of GlcNAc is achieved at subsites –5, –2, and +2. Binding specificity at subsite –5 is determined by a hydrogen-bonding interaction between the Glu70-Oϵ and the nitrogen atom of the N-acetyl group of the bound GlcNAc. At subsite –2 the binding of GlcNAc is stabilized by a complex hydrogen-bonding network involving Trp352, Asn100, and water mediated interactions with Arg263, Glu290, and Gly97. Finally, the N-acetyl group of +2 GlcNAc is hydrogen-bonded, via a water molecule, to the side chain hydroxyl groups of Thr184 and Ser179. A more detailed description of protein-carbohydrate interactions is given in Fig. 3.Fig. 2Structure of HCgp-39 in complex with chitin fragments.

https://openalex.org/W1989996184,"Low energy visible light (LEVL) irradiation has been shown to exert some beneficial effects on various cell cultures. For example, it increases the fertilizing capability of sperm cells, promotes cell proliferation, induces sprouting of neurons, and more. To learn about the mechanism of photobiostimulation, we studied the relationship between increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+] i) and reactive oxygen species production following LEVL illumination of cardiomyocytes. We found that visible light causes the production of O2·¯ and H2O2 and that exogenously added H2O2 (12 μm) can mimic the effect of LEVL (3.6 J/cm2) to induce a slow and transient increase in [Ca2+] i. This [Ca2+] i elevation can be reduced by verapamil, a voltage-dependent calcium channel inhibitor. The kinetics of [Ca2+] i elevation and morphologic damage following light or addition of H2O2 were found to be dosedependent. For example, LEVL, 3.6 J/cm2, which induced a transient increase in [Ca2+] i , did not cause any cell damage, whereas visible light at 12 J/cm2 induced a linear increase in [Ca2+] i and damaged the cells. The linear increase in [Ca2+] i resulting from high energy doses of light could be attenuated into a non-linear small rise in [Ca2+] i by the presence of extracellular catalase during illumination. We suggest that the different kinetics of [Ca2+] i elevation following various light irradiation or H2O2 treatment represents correspondingly different adaptation levels to oxidative stress. The adaptive response of the cells to LEVL represented by the transient increase in [Ca2+] i can explain LEVL beneficial effects.

Life on earth is entirely dependent upon the interaction of sunlight with cells especially in plant photosynthesis (1Blankenship R.E. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 33: 111Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Sunlight also has medical benefits, which have been exploited for over thousands of years in ancient Egypt, India, and China in treating skin diseases, psoriasis, vitiligo, and even cancer (2Epstein J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 32: 1149-1151Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recent observations show that even low energy visible light (LEVL) 1The abbreviations used are: LEVL, low energy visible light; ROS, reactive oxygen species; DEPMPO, 5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide; LDH, lactate dehydrogenese; IP3, inositol triphosphate. can serve as a medical tool. For example, LEVL increases the rate of wound healing (3Conlan M.J. Rapley J.W. Cobb C.M. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1996; 23: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), enhances the fertilizing capability of sperm cells (4Cohen N. Lubart R. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and increases the rate of healing bone defects (5Guzzardella G.A. Fini M. Torricelli P. Giavaresi G. Giardino R. Lasers Med. Sci. 2002; 17: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have found that LEVL increases proliferation of cells as fibroblasts (6Kreisler M. Christoffers A.B. Al-Haj H. Willershausen B. d'Hoedt B. Lasers Surg. Med. 2002; 30: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), keratinocytes (7Grossman N. Schneid N. Reuveni H. Halevy S. Lubart R. Lasers Surg.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: A239Google Scholar) and induces the respiratory burst in neutrophils (9Duan R. Liu T.C.Y. Li Y. Guo H. Yao L.-B. Lasers Surg. Med. 2001; 29: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mechanism of photobiostimulation by LEVL is still unclear. It has been suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be produced by photosensitization of endogenous cell chromophores such as cytochromes (10Spikes J.D. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1984; 170: 19-39PubMed Google Scholar), flavins/riboflavins (11Laloraya M.M. Pradeep K.G. Laloraya M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 543-551PubMed Google Scholar), and NADPH (12Cunningham M.L. Krinsky N.I. Giovanazzi S.M. Peak M.J. J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), may have an important role in this light/tissue interaction (13Friedmann H. Lubart R. Laulicht I. Rochkind S. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1991; 11: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 14Karu T. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1999; 49: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 15Stadler I.

The suggestion is based on the recent recognition that small amounts of ROS are considered to be important for mediating cell activities (16Vanden Hoek T.L. Becker L.B. Shao Z.H. Li C.G.

Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 345-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The production of ROS in response to low energy visible light has been demonstrated in fibroblasts (20Oren D.A. Charney D. Lavie R. Sinyakov M. Lubart R. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 49: 464-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), sperms (21Lubart R., Friedmann, H., and Lavie, R. (2003) Laser Ther., in pressGoogle Scholar), and lymphocytes (15Stadler I. Evans R. Kolb B. Naim J.O. Narayan V. Buehner N. Lanzafame R.J. Lasers Surg. Med. 2000; 27: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been found that LEVL causes [Ca2+] i elevation in cells like sperm (4Cohen N. Lubart R. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and skin (22Lubart R. Friedmann H. Sinykov M. Cohen N. Breitbart H. Lasers Surg. Med. 1997; 21: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transient increases in [Ca2+] i initiate cellular signaling pathways such as activation of photoreceptors and induction of growth factors and contractility (23Krizaj D. Copenhagen D.R. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d2023-d2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kokoska E.R. Wolff A.B. Smith G.S. Miller T.A. J. Surg. Res. 2000; 88: 97-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus a change in [Ca2+] i following LEVL may be another important mediator of photobiostimulation effects. The linkage between [Ca2+] i and the redox state of the cell is well known in controlling many cellular systems. For example, it has been found that H2O2, when added to skeletal muscle fibers, causes an increase in [Ca2+] i , which is prevented by a reducing agent (25Andrade F.H. Reid M.B. Allen D.G. Westerblad H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 565-575Crossref Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Incubation of endothelial cells with H2O2 caused an increase in [Ca2+] i followed by myosin phosphorylation and cell contractions (26Lopez-Ongil S. Torrecillas G. Perez-Sala D. Gonzalez-santiago L. Rodriguez-Puyol M. Rodriguez-Puyol D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Growth factors and hormones were shown to stimulate ROS production, which were dependent on [Ca2+] i rise (27Goldman R. Moshonov S. Zor U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The relationship between ROS and [Ca2+] i has been suggested to involve the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nκβ, which was found to change [Ca2+] i homeostasis in response to changes in the redox state of thiol groups (28Sen C.K. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The kinetics that characterize the [Ca2+] i elevation have been shown to be an important parameter determining the kind of signal that will be evoked. Livingston et al. (29Livingston F.R. Lui E.M.

Biophys. 1992; 299: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that high concentrations of oxidants (>50 μm) caused a sustained increase in [Ca2+] i , whereas a transient increase in [Ca2+] i was observed following administration of a low concentration of oxidants. More than a 4-fold increase in the [Ca2+] i level was obtained in photodynamic treatment of mouse myeloma cells that had been enriched with exogenous photosensitizers before illumination, whereas only a slight increase in [Ca2+] i was observed in irradiated cells without exogenous photosensitizers (30Specht K.G. Rodgers M.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1070: 60-68Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Only a few works have dealt with calcium/ROS changes following LEVL irradiation. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between low energy light, ROS, and [Ca2+] i levels in cardiac cells. We chose cardiomyocytes as low energy photoirradiation has been found to improve heart preservation for transplantation (31Zhu Q. Yu Wei X. Hicks G.L. Ianzafame R.J. Wang T. Lasers Surg. Med. 1997; 20: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, cardiomyocytes possess low levels of antioxidant enzymes, thus being more sensitive to light and ROS. Indo-1/AM was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. 5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DEPMPO) was purchased from Calbiochem, and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone was obtained from Aldrich. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Rat cardiac cells (1–2 day-old) were grown for 3–6 days on a cover-glass coated with gelatin/collagen, as described previously (32Shneyvays V. Jacobson K.A. Li A.-H. Nawrath H. Zinmman T. Isaac A. Shainberg A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cultured cells were then incubated in the dark for 30–50 min with 2 μm of the fluorescence probe indo-1/AM and 1.5 μm pluronic acid in glucose-enriched phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. The cardiac cells were then washed with glucose-enriched phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to a chamber over a Zeiss inverted microscope (Axiovert 135 TV). The microscope was focused on a single cardiomyocyte or a group of two to three cells in the indo-1 loaded culture. Every 2–5 min, the average fluorescence was measured for 10 s (33Fixler D. Tirosh R. Zinman T. Shainberg A. Deutsch M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). While on the chamber of the microscope, the cells were irradiated from 1 to 5 min with a filtered homemade light source (400–800 nm) at 40 mW/cm2. Alternatively, cells were treated with 12–48 μm H2O2 by replacing the medium with glucose-enriched phosphate-buffered saline containing H2O2. To determine whether changes in intracellular calcium are mediated by a specific calcium channel, 10 μm verapamil (L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker) were added to cardiac cells before LEVL irradiation or H2O2 treatment, and then the indo-1 fluorescence was measured. Measurements of Hydrogen Peroxide by Luminol—Cell suspensions of 200 μl (containing 106 cells) were added to 96-well multiwell cluster dishes. Each well was then illuminated, and immediately, horseradish peroxidase (2.4 unit/ml) and luminol (20 μm) were added. The luminescence of each well was measured by a TECAN spectrofluorimeter at room temperature every 30–60 s during a period of 5 min. The peak value of the luminescence as a function of time was taken after subtracting the value of the blank signal (luminescence of the illuminated medium). Measurements of Superoxide Anion Radicals by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spin Trapping Technique—To measure O2·¯ , we used the EPR spin trapping technique with the spin trap DEPMPO (34Murrant C.L. Reid M.B. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 55: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The DEPMPO reacts with hydroxyl radicals to produce DEPMPO-OH or with superoxide anion radicals to produce the spin adduct DEPMPO-OOH (35Frejaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. Le Moigne F. Culcasi M. Pietri S. Lauricella R. Tordo P. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The latter is a relatively stable paramagnetic species (half-life time, 17.7 min; (36Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)) having two conformers with a characteristic EPR spectrum of 18 lines. To simplify the spectrum and to increase its resolution, only the parts of the spectrum where DEPMPO-OOH lines are distinguishable from DEPMPO-OH lines were scanned. Samples of 1.2 × 106 cells/ml with DEPMPO (0.02 m) were drawn by a syringe into a gas-permeable Teflon capillary (Zeus, Raritan, NJ) and inserted into a narrow quartz tube that was open at both ends (37Krishna M.C. Samuni A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 18: 239-247Google Scholar). Then the tube was placed into the EPR cavity, and the spectra were recorded on a Bruker EPR 100d X-band spectrometer while illuminating the samples in the EPR cavity. The EPR measurement conditions were as follows: frequency, 9.75 GHz; power, 20 mW; scan width, 25 G; resolution, 512; receiver gain, 2 × 105; conversion time, 164 ms; time constant, 2622 ms; number of scans, 4; illumination time, 83 s. Using EPR Spin Trapping Technique to Measure Hydroxyl Radicals and Singlet Oxygen Production by Sensitization of Indo-1/AM—The fluorescence probe indo-1 that was used to measured [Ca2+] i does not overlap with the wavelength range of our light source treatment as its excitation length is 355 nm. Nevertheless, to exclude any possibility that indo-1 can be photosensitized by the light source, we measured the EPR spin trap spectrum of indo-1/AM during illumination. Neither production of 1O2 nor production of O2·¯ or production of OH• was obtained using the spin traps 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, respectively (data not shown). Myocytes in phosphate-buffered saline were treated with increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or were illuminated with different doses of light. After 50 min, the cells were returned to growth medium and placed in a 5% CO2 incubator environment at 37 °C. The cells were fixed after 24 h, and then immunohistochemical staining was performed using mouse monoclonal anti-α-sarcomeric actin(C-5) and goat anti-mouse biotinylated immunoglobulin conjugated with extrAvidin peroxidase (immunohistochemical kit, stock number IMMH-1). Following staining with chromogen 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole, the cells were counterstained with hematoxylin (32Shneyvays V. Jacobson K.A. Li A.-H. Nawrath H. Zinmman T. Isaac A. Shainberg A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity was assessed by activity of released LDH into the culture medium. The LDH activity was measured using an LDH kit as described before (38Safran N. Shnevays V. Balas N. Jacobson K.A. Nawrath H. Shainberg A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2001; 217: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as percent of LDH released in samples relative to samples in which cells were lysed with 1% Triton x-100. ROS Production by Cardiomyocytes—To verify the generation of ROS in response to visible light, we measured H2O2 via luminol and measured O2·¯ by the EPR spin trapping technique using DEPMPO. Broad band visible light illumination (3.6 J/cm2) of cardiomyocyte suspension in the presence of luminol resulted in a significant increase of 75 ± 20% (p ≤ 0.047) in the luminescence of luminol (Fig. 1). This indicates that LEVL illumination increases the H2O2 concentration in the cells. The EPR technique confirms the presence of O2·¯ . In Fig. 2a, a simulated spectrum of DEPMPO after trapping O2·¯ to form DEPMPO-OOH is shown in the detectable range. Illuminating cardiomyocytes while scanning the EPR spectrum for 83 s resulted in the appearance of a spectrum that is compatible with that of DEPMPO-OOH (Fig. 2b), whereas the non-illuminated cell suspension spectrum exhibited only background noise (Fig. 2c). Addition of superoxide dismutase, a superoxide oxide anion scavenger, to the cell suspension decreased the intensity of the DEPMPO-OOH spin adduct signal (Fig. 2d). These results show that LEVL illumination increases the level of O2·¯ in illuminated cardiomyocytes.Fig. 2EPR spin trapping measurements of super oxide anion with the spin trap, DEPMPO. a, simulated spectrum of the superoxide adduct of DEPMPO (DEPMPO-OOH) (assuming two conformers, A and B, of DEPMPO-OOH with the EPR hyperfine splitting constant (36Roubaud V.

We found that illumination at an energy density of 3.6 J/cm2 caused a semitransient elevation of [Ca2+] i with a broad peak of 12%, which lasted for more than 30 min followed by a decrease to a stable plateau of 8% above the control (Fig. 3, curve b, and see also Fig. 7, curve a). Increasing the light energy density to 12 J/cm2 resulted in a linear elevation of [Ca2+] i , which reached 25% at 60 min after illumination (Fig. 3, curve c). Nevertheless, this elevation was reduced to 7% above control, as a result of including 200 units/ml catalase (H2O2 scavenger) into the medium before illumination (Fig. 3, curve d). In the control, the observed [Ca2+] i values fluctuated up to 3% above and 2% below the basal level during 80 min (Fig. 3, curve a).Fig. 7Effect of visible light on [Ca2+] i in cardiomyocytes treated in the presence of verapamil.

(Light was applied at time 0.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of H2O2 on [Ca2+]i—To support our hypothesis that ROS take part in the pathway leading to the increase in [Ca2+] i following visible light illumination, we next compared the effect of light with that of H2O2 on [Ca2+] i changes. The kinetics of [Ca2+] i change after H2O2 treatment were found to be concentration-dependent and ranged from a transient increase in [Ca2+] i to an exponential increase over time (Fig. 4). Although H2O2 at all concentrations was present in the medium during the measurement, 12–18 μm H2O2 caused a transient increase in [Ca2+] i with a peak of 12% above the control, about 35 min after addition of H2O2 (Fig. 4, curve a and inset, and see also Fig. 8, curve a). Addition of 48 μm H2O2 caused a moderate increase in [Ca2+] i during the first 20 min, which was followed by a linear increase in [Ca2+] i , reaching a plateau of 150% at 50 min after its addition (Fig. 4, curve c). A concentration of 24 μm H2O2 showed an intermediate behavior: the calcium oscillations were increased, reaching a maximum of 60% at 38 min after the addition of H2O2, and the [Ca2+] i did not return to the basal level but decreased to a semiplateau 50% above the control (Fig. 4, curve b). Comparing these results with those obtained with LEVL (Fig. 3, curve b, and see also Fig. 7, curve a) indicates that 12 μm H2O2 can mimic the effect of 3.6 J/cm2 of visible light and that both cause a slow and a long lasting increase of [Ca2+] i. In both treatments, the kinetics of the [Ca2+] i changes are dependent on the concentration of H2O2 or on the light energy doses.Fig. 8Effect of hydrogen peroxide on [Ca2+] i in cardiomyocytes in the presence of verapamil. Curve a, ▴, 18 μm H2O2 without verapamil; curve b, ▵, in the presence of 18 μm H2O2 and 10 μm verapamil; curve c, □, in the presence of 10 μm verapamil without H2O2.

(H2O2 was applied at time 0.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of Light or H2O2 on the Viability of the Cells—To rule out the possibility that visible light, at the doses employed, causes damage to the cell membrane, we measured LDH secretion to the medium immediately, 2.5, 6, and 24 h after 3.6 or 12 J/cm2 of visible light illumination (LDH is a biochemical marker for the integrity of the membrane (39Gomez-Lechon M.J. O'Connor E. Castell J.V. Jover R. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 65: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)). We found that the amount of LDH released to the medium at various times after 3.6 or 12 J/cm2 of illumination was similar to that of the LDH released in non-illuminated cultures (Fig. 5), and the increase in LDH level during 24 h is only due to natural exocytotic release. Another approach for determining the effect of light or H2O2 was to observe the cell morphology 24 h after illumination or treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 6). The cultured cells were immunocytochemically stained for α-sarcomeric actin to observe the contractile filaments and were counterstained with hematoxylin to observe the nucleus. In the control (Fig. 6A), most of the cardiomyocytes were flattened with strands of well organized myofibrils α-sarcomeric actin with evident cross-striation. The nucleus showed a well stained chromatin structure. Treatment with 12 μm H2O2 maintained cross-striations but caused a slight disorganization of the myofibril structure and a slight loss of α-sarcomeric actin staining. No changes were shown in the nucleus (Fig. 6B). Increasing the H2O2 concentration to 24 μm caused focal disorganization of myofibril structures, vacuolization of the cytoplasm (green arrow), and picnotic damage to many nuclei (white arrow). Nevertheless, approx. 65% of cells did not exhibit changes (Fig. 6C). By further increaszhying the H2O2 concentration to 48 μm, a severe alteration of the α-sarcomeric actin-positive structure, disorganization of the myofibrils, vacuolization of the cytoplasm, and perinuclear edema (green arrow) were induced. The nucleus showed picnotic damage (Fig. 6D, white arrow). Illumination at 3.6 J/cm2 caused no visible alteration in cardiomyocyte structure, as seen in stained α-sarcomeric actin myofibrils and maintenance of cross-striation (Fig. 6E). Increasing the illuminating energy to 7.2 J/cm2 caused a decrease in the α-sarcomeric actin staining, but the nucleus was without visible changes (Fig. 6F). Increasing the illumination energy to 12 J/cm2 caused a disorganization of the myofibril structures, decrease in α-sarcomeric actin staining, vacuolization of the cytoplasm, and oncotic damage (swelling) of the cytoplasm, although no visible damage to the nuclei was seen (Fig. 6G). Adding exogenous catalase (200 units/ml) to the medium of cardiomyocyte culture before irradiation with 12 J/cm2 protected the cells, as seen in Fig. 6H. We conclude that the toxic effect of visible light or H2O2 to cardiomyocytes is dose-dependent. Illumination below 3.6 J/cm2 or concentrations below 24 μm H2O2 do not cause any damage to the majority of the cells 24 h after treatment. Therefore, visible light illumination with energy less than 3.6 J/cm2 appears safe for cardiomyocytes. Moreover, the kinetics of [Ca2+] i measured with increasing doses of light or H2O2 treatment show a good correlation with the viability of the cells. Mild treatment with light (3.6 J/cm2) or a low H2O2 concentration (12 μm), which do not damage the cell (Fig. 6, E and B), cause a transient increase in [Ca2+] i (LEVL: Figs. 3, curve b, and 7, curve a, H2O2: Figs. 4, curve a, and 8, curve a). Increasing the H2O2 concentration to 24 μm caused a damage to some of the cells (Fig. 6C) and changed the kinetics of [Ca2+] i to oscillation, reaching a plateau (Fig. 4, curve b). High doses of light 12 J/cm2 or H2O2 48 μm, which show a clear toxic effect on the cells 24 h after treatment (Fig. 6, G and D), were correlated with a linear increase in [Ca2+] i (Fig. 3, curve c) or a semiexponential increase (Fig. 4, curve c), respectively. Furthermore, the presence of catalase, which reduces the H2O2 concentration, formed by visible light illumination, causes a change in the [Ca2+] i kinetics. The linear kinetics observed after 12 J/cm2 of illumination change into smaller oscillations in the presence of catalase (Fig. 3, curve d), which also prevented cell damage (Fig. 6H). These results suggest that the kinetics of [Ca2+] i can reflect the ability of the cells to adapt to changes due to H2O2 and light. However, light treatment of 3.6 J/cm2 and low H2O2 concentrations (12 μm) are doses that the cell tolerates. Effects of Verapamil on [Ca2 + ]i Increase Following LEVL or H2O2—We have previously observed that the source for [Ca2+] i elevation following LEVL illumination in sperm cells is Ca2+ influx from the external medium (4Cohen N. Lubart R. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To learn about the mechanism of [Ca2+] i elevation following LEVL illumination in cardiomyocytes, we measured the [Ca2+] i changes in cultured treated cells to which verapamil was added 15 min before treatment. Our results show that verapamil, which has no effect on [Ca2+] i (Fig. 7, curve c), can attenuate the increase in [Ca2+]i after 3.6 J/cm2 of illumination (Fig. 7, curve b) or 18 μm H2O2 addition (Fig. 8, curve b). These results suggest that one of the ways by which low doses of visible light as well as low concentrations of H2O2 increase [Ca2+] i in cardiomyocytes is by calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels. Nevertheless, as verapamil did not prevent completely the increase in [Ca2+] i , other possibilities are not excluded. In the present study, the change in [Ca2+] i in LEVL-illuminated cardiomyocytes and its linkage to ROS production and to the cell viability are demonstrated. The kinetics of the increase of [Ca2+] i have been found to reflect an adaptive response of the cells to oxidative stress. Generation of ROS in LEVL-illuminated Cardiomyocytes— In Figs. 1 and 2, O2·¯ and H2O2 formation in LEVL-illuminated cardiomyocytes is shown. It is believed that ROS are produced through activation of endogenous photosensitizers. Therefore, the resulting ROS are spread all over the cell, in contrast to photodynamic therapy treatment, where the cells are loaded with exogenous photosensitizers and most of the ROS are produced in subcellular locations based on the photosensitizer localization (such as plasma membrane, mitochondria or lysosomes) (40Moor A.C. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 2000; 57: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although ROS can lead to cell death, at minute concentrations, they can regulate signal transduction pathways including activation of protein kinases and redox-sensing transcription factors in cardiomyocytes (18Das"

Recently, it was shown that hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors can function as pharmacological activators of Akt and mobilize bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells through stimulation of the Akt signaling pathway (24Kureishi Y.

Furthermore, thymocytes from Akt1-null mice are reported to be more susceptible to spontaneous and stress-induced apoptosis (17Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). However, the properties of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have never been studied in mouse models that are deficient for Akt signaling. Side population (SP) cells represent a rare fraction of bone marrow that is detected by dual-wavelength flow cytometry on the basis of their ability to efflux fluorescent Hoechst 33342 dye (27Goodell M.A. Brose K. Paradis G. Conner A.S. Mulligan R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). These cells are of interest because they are highly enriched for HSC activity. SP cells have been identified in hematopoietic compartments of mice, humans, monkeys, and swine (28Uchida N. Leung F.Y. Eaves C.J. Exp.

Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I. Grosveld G.C. Osawa M. Nakauchi H. Sorrentino B.P. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Stem cells express at least two different ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that can mediate dye efflux. One is a breast cancer-resistant protein 1 (Bcrp1), also called ABCG2, and the other is a multidrug-resistant protein1 (Mdr1), which is also known as P-glycoprotein (38Chaudhary P.M. Roninson I.B.

Woods D. Orlic D. Blood. 1995; 86: 491-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, targeted gene ablation studies in mice have revealed that the hematopoietic SP cell phenotype is determined by Bcrp1 but not by Mdr1 (28Uchida N. Leung F.Y. Eaves C.J. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 862-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 42Zhou S. Morris J.J. Barnes Y. Lan L. Schuetz J.D. Sorrentino B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12339-12344Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Bcrp1 expression is sharply down-regulated upon hematopoietic cell maturation, and it is not detected in mature blood cells (43Scheffer G.L. Maliepaard M. Pijnenborg A.C. van Gastelen M.A. de Jong M.C. Schroeijers A.B. van der Kolk D.M. Allen J.D. Ross D.D. van der Valk P. Dalton W.S. Schellens J.H. Scheper R.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2589-2593PubMed Google Scholar). Bcrp1-null mice exhibit normal steady-state hematopoiesis and HSC number. These data indicate that Bcrp1 is a marker of HSC, but it is not necessary for stem cell self-renewal or differentiation. To elucidate the intracellular signaling mechanisms that control stem cell biology, we analyzed the bone marrow SP cells in Akt1-null mice. We report that Akt1-deficient mice display a reduction in SP fraction. The SP fraction was also diminished when bone marrow was incubated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and this was associated with Bcrp1 translocation from the membrane to intracellular sites. Transduction with a constitutively active Akt1 led to a marked increase in SP cells in bone marrow from wild-type but not Brcp1-null mice. These data suggest that the PI3K/Akt1 signaling axis can control the SP phenotype through the regulation of Bcrp1 expression. Mice—Akt1-deficient mice on a C57BL/6J background were kindly provided by Dr. Morris J. Birnbaum (University of Pennsylvania). Akt2-deficient mice on a C57BL/6J background were kindly provided by Dr. Joseph Testa (Fox Chase Cancer Center). Bcrp1-deficient mice on a mixed background (129/Ola and C57BL/6J) were kindly provided by Dr. Brian Sorrentino (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). C57BL/6J mice and FVB mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA), and B6.SJL mice were from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Boston University. Hoechst and Antibody Staining for Flow Cytometry Analysis—Murine SP cell analysis was performed as described previously (30Goodell M.A. Rosenzweig M. Kim H. Marks D.F. DeMaria M. Paradis G. Grupp S.A. Sieff C.A. Mulligan R.C. Johnson R.P. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Typically, bone marrow cells were isolated from six crushed bones (tibias, femurs, and iliacs) and stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES at 37 °C for 90 min. After the incubation, cells were kept on ice immediately and washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES. After these steps, cells were resuspended with Hanks' balanced salt solution medium and analyzed in a triple laser instrument (MoFlo®, DakoCytomation Inc., Fort Collins, CO) following propidium iodide staining (2 μg/ml) for excluding dead cells. SP gates were defined using non-treated wild-type bone marrow cells stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst in each analysis. For analyzing the effect of inhibitors, LY294002 (10 μm), PD98059 (10 μm) (Calbiochem), and verapamil (150 μm) (Sigma) were added to total bone marrow cells before 30 min of Hoechst staining. For KSL-antibody staining, bone marrow cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated ScaI antibody (E13-161.7), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated c-Kit antibody (2B8) (BD Biosciences), and biotinylated Mouse Lineage Mixture antibodies consisting of CD5, CD11b, CD45R, GR1, 7-4, and TER119 (2 μl each) (StemCell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). After washing twice, cells were resuspended into 100 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with streptavidin-RED670-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen) for 30 min on ice. Samples were analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using Cellquest software. For CD34-antibody staining, FITC-conjugated CD34 antibody (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) was used. Isotype control antibodies were also used for establishing positive-cell gating in KSL and CD34 staining. Progenitor Colony Formation Assays—Fresh Akt1-deficient and wild-type whole marrow cells were assessed for in vitro colony-forming unit culture (CFU-c) and high proliferative potential colony-forming cell (HPP-CFC) assay using a double layer soft agar nutrient medium technique in 35-mm plastic culture dishes (Falcon) (44Bertoncello I. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 177: 83-94PubMed Google Scholar, 45Bertoncello I. Kriegler A.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 75: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar, 46Kriegler M.

The bottom layer consisted of the following: 1.0-ml underlay of 0.5% agar (Difco) with α-minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 20% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen) and 1, 3, or 7 separate growth factors. The concentration of growth factors are as follows: recombinant murine colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), 7,500 units per plate (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), 3.75 ng per plate (R&D Systems); murine interleukin (IL)-1α, 375 units per plate (R&D Systems); recombinant murine IL-3, 150 units per plate (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA); recombinant murine steel factor, 150 ng per plate (R&D Systems); murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), 7.5 ng per plate (R&D Systems); and recombinant murine basic fibroblast growth factor, 7.5 ng per plate (Collaborative Research). The seven-factor combination consisted of basic fibroblast growth factor, CSF-1, GCSF, GM-CSF, IL-1α, IL-3, and SCF; the three-factor consisted of CSF-1, GCSF, and GM-CSF; and CSF-1 was used for the one-factor. Cells were plated at a concentration of 20,000 cells per plate in a 0.5-ml overlayer of 0.3% agar in α-minimum Eagle's medium with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Five culture dishes were set up per group per time point. The plates were incubated in a humidified 5% O2, 10% CO2, 85% N2 37 °C water-jacketed incubator (Forma Scientific Inc., Marietta, OH). After 2 weeks, the colonies were scored by using a dissecting microscope at ×20 magnification. Dishes were scored for HPP-CFC and CFU-c. HPP-CFCs were considered highly dense colonies over 0.5 mm in diameter or moderately dense colonies of over 1.0 mm. CFU-cs were considered to be all other colonies of over 50 cells and not meeting the criteria for HPP-CFC. Total progenitors represented the combined values for HPP-CFC and CFU-c. Competitive Bone Marrow Transplantation—B6.SJL congenic mouse expressing CD45.1 and Akt1-deficient mice expressing CD45.2 antigen were used. Fresh male B6.SJL marrow cells (2 × 106) (CD45.1) were injected with an equal number of fresh male Akt1-deficient or wild-type whole marrow cells (2 × 106) (CD45.2) into lethally irradiated B6.SJL mice. These mice were exposed to 9 Gy in a single dose given at a dose rate of 0.85 Gy/min 3 h prior to cell infusion. Mice were sacrificed 16 weeks after cell infusion. Engraftment efficiency was analyzed by flow cytometry. Marrow was flushed from femurs, iliacs, and tibias and then incubated with biotin-conjugated mouse anti-mouse CD45.1 mAb (BD Biosciences) and FITC-conjugated mouse anti-mouse CD45.2 mAb (Pharmingen) for 30 min in the dark on ice. Secondary biotin labeling with streptavidin allophycocyanin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was then performed (26Dimmeler S. Aicher A. Vasa M. Mildner-Rihm C. Adler K. Tiemann M. Rütten H.

Med. 1996; 183: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). At least 2 × 106 cells were stained, and a minimum of 20,000 events were analyzed per sample. The samples were kept on ice and in the dark prior to sorting. Propidium iodide (Sigma) was used immediately preceding flow cytometry to gate out dead cells (37Zhou S. Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D. Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I. Grosveld G.C. Osawa M. Nakauchi H. Sorrentino B.P. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed within 2 h of completion of antibody staining. Donor chimerism was calculated as CD45.2/(CD45.1 + CD45.2). For lineage analysis, bone marrow was labeled with rat anti-mouse Ly6G/GR-1 (8C5 hybridoma), CD45R/B-220 (RA3 hybridoma), CD3 (T cells) (Pharmingen), CD4 (T-helper cells, MHC-II) (Pharmingen), or CD8 (T-suppressor cells, MHC-I) (Pharmingen) mAbs. Donor specificity was detected using a mouse anti-mouse biotin-CD45.2 mAb (Pharmingen). A FITC-polyclonal goat anti-rat mAb (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and streptavidin allophycocyanin (Molecular Probes) were used for detection. Propidium iodide (Sigma) was used immediately preceding flow cytometry to gate out dead cells. Samples were analyzed within 2 h of completion of antibody staining. Lentiviral-Vector Plasmid Construction—pLenti6/V5-GW/myrAkt was constructed using pLenti6/V5 Directional TOPO® cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The myrAkt component was amplified by PCR from plasmid pcDNA3-CMV-myrAkt (49Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) using the following primers: forward, 5′-CACCATGGGGAGCAGCAAGAGCAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGCTGTGCCACTGGCTGAGTAGG-3′. The forward primer added four bases (CACC) to the myrAkt sequence, which facilitated the cloning of the target sequence into the pLenti6/V5-d-TOPO vector. After cloning, the vector was transformed into chemical-competent Escherichia coli with the heat shock (42 °C) method. The correct orientation of the myrAkt gene in the vector was confirmed by sequencing. Virus Production—Virus was produced using ViraPower™ Lentiviral Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, myrAkt or control vector (pLenti6/V5-GW/LacZ) were cotransfected with the mixture of the packaging plasmids: pLP1, pLP2, and pLP/VSVG using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) into the 293FT producer cell line which stably expresses the SV40 large T antigen from pCMVSPORT6Tag.neo plasmid. The medium was replaced 16-20 h after transfection with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium containing the viral particles was collected 48 or 72 h after transfection and filtered through 0.45-μm filters (Nalgene, Rochester, NY) following low speed centrifugation (3000 rpm for 15 min). Viral titers (transducing units/ml) were determined by transduction of 293FT cells with serial dilutions of the viral supernatant and colony counting after blasticidin selection. Transduction of Bone Marrow Cells—Virus supernatant was added to bulk bone marrow cells with 6 μg/ml Polybrene. Cells were centrifuged at 250 × g for 2 h for high transfection efficiency (spinoculation) and kept on ice for 24 h prior to staining with Hoechst. Transfection efficiency was estimated by immunofluorescence staining with FITC-conjugated V5-epitope antibody (Invitrogen) in bulk bone marrow cells. Immunofluorescence—Isolated SP cells (1.0 × 104) were incubated at 37 °C with or without LY294002 (10 μm). After 90 min of incubation, cells were fixed by ethanol and methanol solution (1:1 mixed) and permeabilized by 0.1% saponin prior to incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse Bcrp1 antibody (34Summer R. Kotton D.N. Sun X. Ma B. Fitzsimmons K. Fine A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L97-L104PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Cells were counterstained with DAPI. Images were viewed at ×60 magnification, and data were acquired with high resolution digital color camera and analyzed with deconvolution imaging effects using automated image analysis software (OpenLab, Improvision Inc., Lexington, MA). Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as means ± S.E. For competitive engraftment and in vitro colony-forming assays, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to evaluate the equality of matched pairs of observations. For this, the STATA® 6.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX) program was used. All other data were evaluated with a two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test or compared by one-way analysis of variance. SP Cell Fraction in Akt-Null Mice—Nine-week old Akt1 -/- and age-matched wild-type mice were used to assess SP cells in bone marrow. As shown in Fig. 1, a and b, the SP cell fraction is significantly reduced in Akt1 -/- mice relative to wild-type mice. The SP fraction in Akt1 -/- mouse ranged from 0.02-0.06% compared with 0.07-0.12% in wild-type C57BL/6J mice (n = 5 each). To reduce experiment-to-experiment variability, SP fractions in age-matched Akt1 -/- and wild-type mice were assessed on the same day and expressed as a ratio with the wild-type SP fraction designated as 1.0. Combined analyses from multiple experiments revealed that the SP cell fraction in Akt1 -/- mice was less than half that seen in wild-type animals (Fig. 1c). In contrast, an analysis of Akt2 -/- mice relative to wild-type mice (n = 5 each) revealed no detectable difference between the two strains (Fig. 1d). Bone Marrow Cultures and Engraftment—The body weight of Akt1 -/- mice was ∼8% smaller than that of wild-type mice (Table I), whereas Akt2 -/- mice had normal body size compared with wild-type mice (data not shown). These data are consistent with the findings of others (16Cho H. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Feng F. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

Despite this modest reduction in body size, Akt1-deficient mice had the same total number of bone marrow cells, and these cells were similar in size and cell cycle characteristics when compared with bone marrow from wild-type mice. Furthermore, no differences were apparent in the frequencies of CD34+ or c-Kit+/ScaI+/Lin- (KSL) cell fractions between wild-type and Akt1-null mice (Table I). Finally, Akt1-null mice did not have any detectable differences in peripheral blood leukocyte count or hematocrit (data not shown).Table IParameter comparisons between Akt1 +/+ (wild-type) and Akt1 −/− miceBody weightBMC (million)Cell size (FACS mean)Cell cycle (G0G1/S/G2M %)CD34+ cells (%)c-Kit+/Scal+/Lin− cellsg%Akt1+/+17.8 ± 0.8124 ± 37564.271.7/11.0/15.210.8 ± 2.71.03 ± 0.45Akt1−/−16.4 ± 0.5ap < 0.05.120 ± 32564.169.4/9.8/18.510.4 ± 6.11.01 ± 0.45a p < 0.05.

In vitro analysis comparing Akt1 -/- with wild-type mice was performed by plating 20,000 fresh marrow cells in HPP-CFC and CFU-c assays for 14 days using a double layer soft agar nutrient medium technique. There were little or no differences in colony formation between Akt1 -/- and wild-type marrow in response to 7, 3, or 1 growth factor mixtures (Fig. 2). To evaluate engraftable stem cells in Akt1 -/- mice, an in vivo competitive assay was employed. This assay compared engraftable stem cells between B6.SJL mice (CD45.1) and Akt1 -/- or wild-type mice (CD45.2) in lethally irradiated B6.SJL hosts (Fig. 3a). The results showed a slight advantage to the Akt1-deficient marrow compared with the wild-type controls (p = 0.041). Lineage analysis of the engrafted cells showed no significant differences (Fig. 3, b and c). Apoptosis in Bone Marrow and SP Cells—To test whether the diminished SP fraction in Akt1-null mice could be due to an increase in the frequency of apoptosis, bone marrow cells from wild-type and Akt1 -/- mice were assessed for their relative sensitivities to Hoechst 33342 toxicity. For these experiments, total bone marrow cells were exposed to 5 μg of Hoechst 33342 per ml for 90 min prior to the addition of propidium iodide and flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 4a).

Their synthesis is increased during cellular stress by p53-mediated activation of transcription. Overexpression of these isoforms induces apoptosis, suggesting an involvement of TP53INP1s in p53-mediated cell death. It was recently shown that p53-dependent apoptosis is promoted by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2), which is known to bind p53 and induce its phosphorylation in promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). In this work we show that TP53INP1s localize with p53, PML-IV, and HIPK2 into the PML-NBs. In addition, we show that TP53INP1s interact physically with HIPK2 and p53. In agreement with these results we demonstrate that TP53INP1s, in association with HIPK2, regulate p53 transcriptional activity on p21, mdm2, pig3, and bax promoters. Furthermore, TP53INP1s overexpression induces G1 arrest and increases p53-mediated apoptosis. Although a TP53INP1s and HIPK2 additive effect was observed on apoptosis, G1 arrest was weaker when HIPK2 was transfected together with TP53INP1.

Vaccaro M.I. Pebusque M.J. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Dusetti N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44185-44192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), is strongly activated in the diseased pancreas. The mouse SIP gene expands over ∼20 kb and is organized in 5 exons. Exon 4 is alternatively spliced to generate two transcripts that encode proteins of 18 and 27 kDa (SIP18 and SIP27). SIP27 is identical to the TEAP protein, formerly described as a thymus-expressed protein (2Carrier A. Nguyen C. Victorero G. Granjeaud S. Rocha D. Bernard K. Miazek A. Ferrier P. Malissen M. Naquet P. Malissen B. Jordan B.R. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). SIP18 and SIP27 are localized mainly in the nucleus, as shown in previous experiments using SIP-GFP fusion proteins (1Tomasini R. Samir A.A. Vaccaro M.I. Pebusque M.J. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Dusetti N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44185-44192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In vitro, expression of SIP mRNAs is strongly induced in fibroblasts submitted to various stress agents such as UV, base damage, ethanol, heat shock, and oxidative stress. It is noteworthy that mRNAs encoding SIP18 and SIP27 are concomitantly activated in response to these stresses. We also showed that SIP gene expression is p53-dependent (3Tomasini R. Samir A.A. Pebusque M.J. Calvo E.L. Totaro S. Dagorn J.C. Dusetti N.J. Iovanna J.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Finally, we found that overexpression of SIP18 or SIP27 induces apoptosis, indicating that SIP gene expression is a key element in p53-mediated cell death that occurs as a consequence of cellular stress. Independently, Okamura et al. (4Okamura S. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Nakanishi H. Ng C.C. Taya Y. Monden M. Nakamura Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) cloned a new human gene named p53DINP1. This gene encodes a p53-inducible nuclear protein that promotes apoptosis when overexpressed in MCF7 cells. Sequence analysis revealed that SIP, p53DINP1, and TEAP are in fact alternative names for the same gene that was approved as TP53INP1 (tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1) by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee, with TP53INP1α and TP53INP1β proteins corresponding to SIP18 and SIP27, respectively. Okamura et al. (4Okamura S. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Nakanishi H. Ng C.C. Taya Y. Monden M. Nakamura Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) demonstrated, using a very elegant approach, that TP53INP1s bind to a kinase that phosphorylates p53 at Ser-46, such a phosphorylation being apparently crucial for UV-induced apoptosis (5Bulavin D.V.

Unfortunately, that critical kinase was not identified in Okamura's work. More recently, two papers showed that in subnuclear structures called promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), 1The abbreviations used are: PML, promyelocytic leukemia protein; NBs, nuclear bodies; GFP, green fluorescence protein; PIG3, p53-inducible gene-3; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; wt, wild type; HIPK2, homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CMV, cytomegalovirus. the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) binds to p53 and phosphorylates its Ser-46 to promote p53-dependent apoptosis (7D'Orazi G.

The aim of the present work was to investigate a possible relationship between TP53INP1s, HIPK2, and p53. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK 293, MEF p53–/–, RasV12/E1A-transformed MEFs (9Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia S. Bagnis C. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), RKO and U2OS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin, in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with FuGENE-6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. RasV12/E1A-transformed MEFs were irradiated with γ-rays (30 gray) using a Gammacell 1000 radiator. Antibodies and Plasmids—Antibodies recognizing FLAG (F7425) and β-tubulin (TUB 2.1) were from Sigma; p53 (FL-393), PML (PM-G3), anti-p21WAF1 (sc-397), and goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG rhodamine (SC-2091) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.

In Vitro Pull-down and Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins translated in vitro were synthesized with a TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of l-[35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Labeled proteins were incubated with 10 μg of GST fusion protein at 4 °C for 2 h with in vitro interaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and a mix of protease inhibitors), washed four times with 500 μl of in vitro interaction buffer, and two times with 500 μl of PBS. Bound proteins were eluted with 1× SDS sample buffer, separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. For in vivo co-immunoprecipitation, U2OS cells were plated on 60-mm Petri dishes and transiently transfected. Thirty-six hours after transfection, total cellular extracts were prepared with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P40, and a mix of protease inhibitors). Equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μl/sample of anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) on protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science). Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed five times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were blocked in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 0.1% plus 3% dried skimmed milk and incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody or anti-p53 rabbit polyclonal antiserum. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with 2 μg of expression vector. Twenty-four hours later they were washed once with 1× PBS, fixed for 15 min at room temperature in PBS-3% paraformaldehyde, and then washed twice with PBS and blocked in PBS, 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated for 60 min with the primary antibodies at room temperature and washed four times (5 min each) in PBS before incubation for 60 min with the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were mounted on glass slides and examined with a confocal laser microscope (TCS NT Leica apparatus, Heidelberg, Germany). Trans-activation Assays—Cells were transiently transfected with reporter vectors in which the luciferase gene was driven by the p53-dependent intronic promoter of the murine mdm2 gene (11Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), the human bax promoter (12Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), the pig3 promoter (13Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweir J.L. Winzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar), or the p21WAF1 promoter (kindly provided by M. Oren and B. Vogelstein). Transcriptional activity was evaluated after co-transfection with the indicated expression constructs. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cellular extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity and results were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. All co-transfections were balanced with pcDNA4 empty vector. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis of p21 expression, 100 μg of total cellular extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and subsequently incubated with anti-p21WAF1 monoclonal antibody and anti-β-tubulin for loading control. Filters were washed in Tris-buffered saline-Tween and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG. Antibodies were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction kit (Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression constructs. The following day, they were fixed in methanol-acetone (4:1 v/v) for 30 min. Cells were stained with 18 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 20 μg/ml RNase A (United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). GFP-positive cells were sorted in the FL1 channel of a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) equipped with CELLQuest software. Their cellular content was measured with a logarithmic amplification in the FL3 channel. Colony Formation Assay—RKO cells (105) were plated into 10-cm Petri dishes and transfected 24 h later with the indicated expression vectors using FuGENE-6 reagent as described above. The transfected cells were selected in puromycin and G418 (0.5 mg/ml) for 10 days and stained with crystal violet to assess the number of colonies. That experiment was repeated three times. Cell Death Assays—Cell death was evaluated in HEK 293 cells transfected with pCMV/GFP, pTP53INP1α-GFP, or pTP53INP1β-GFP alone or in combination with pHIPK2-FLAG. Cells were plated on glass coverslips for 16 h prior to transfection. 36 h after transfection, cells expressing GFP or TP53INPs-GFP fusion proteins were scored for morphological features of apoptosis by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy; the number of green cells presenting this morphology on six different optic fields were recorded. This experiment was done in triplicate. TP53INP1s Bind HIPK2 and p53—The first experiment was designed to examine whether TP53INP1s bind to HIPK2. To this end, in vitro pull-down experiments were carried out to demonstrate a direct interaction between GST-TP53INP1α and GST-TP53INP1β with HIPK2. As shown in Fig. 1b, both GST-TP53INP1α and GST-TP53INP1β bind to the 35S-labeled HIPK2, whereas HIPK2 does not bind to the control GST protein. Surprisingly, we also found that GST-TP53INP1α and GST-TP53INP1β bind to 35S-labeled p53 (Fig. 1c). These direct in vitro interactions were confirmed by reciprocal binding experiments using GST-HIPK2 and GST-p53 together with 35S-labeled TP53INP1α and TP53INP1β (Fig. 1d). To further establish that TP53INP1α and TP53INP1β also interact with HIPK2 and p53 in vivo, we co-transfected HEK 293 cells with TP53INP1s-V5 constructs with either HIPK2-FLAG or p53 constructs. As shown in Fig. 2, TP53INP1α/β bind to p53 and HIPK2. To confirm endogenous interactions, γ-irradiation was used to induce a stress in RasV12/E1A-transformed MEFs, which are known to trigger TP53INP1 expression (4Okamura S. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Nakanishi H. Ng C.C. Taya Y. Monden M. Nakamura Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 9Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia S. Bagnis C. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after irradiation, cells were collected and homogenized, and total cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with TP53INP1α/β antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2b, p53 and HIPK2 are both associated with endogenous TP53INP1α/β. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that overexpressed and endogenous TP53INP1α/β proteins interact with HIPK2 and p53 in vitro and in vivo. We next performed GST-pull down experiments to identify the regions through which TP53INP1α and β bind to HIPK2 and p53. As shown in Fig. 1d, TP53INP1α and TP53INP1β bind to GST-HIPK2 and to the GST-p53 in the C-terminal region of both proteins. It is known that the region comprising amino acids 853 to 955 of HIPK2 binds to the C-terminal region of p53 (amino acids 295–390) (7D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Coen S. Marchetti A. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Fanciulli M. Appella E. Soddu S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 8Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Therefore, a competition between TP53INP1s and HIPK2 for p53 binding is conceivable. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of p53 has already been characterized as a regulatory region (14Vousden K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) to which several regulatory proteins can bind (15Wiederschain D. Gu J. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27999-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The complex interaction between TP53INP1s, HIPK2 and p53 we demonstrated in the present study suggest that it could be involved in a regulatory mechanism. TP53INP1s Co-localize with HIPK2 and p53 into the PML-NBs—The subcellular distributions of TP53INP1α, TP53INP1β, HIPK2, and p53 were next studied. It was recently demonstrated that PML-IV, a PML splice variant, can relocalize p53 into PML-specific sub-nuclear structures named PML nuclear bodies (10Fogal V. Gostissa M. Sandy P. Zacchi P. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Pandolfi P.P. Will H. Schneider C. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6185-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This relocalization promotes several p53 post-translational modifications, which enhance its trans-activation activity (16Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2002; 108: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). PML-NBs are cell cycle-regulated nuclear structures that appear as punctate foci in interphase nuclei (17Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Promyelocytic leukemia protein, the most prominent component of these structures, plays a fundamental role in directing complex protein-protein interactions (18Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The possible role of PML-NBs in cell growth control is suggested by studies in PML knock-out mice that indicate their tumor suppressor and pro-apoptotic functions (19Quignon F. De Bels F. Koken M. Feunteun J. Ameisen J.C. de The H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 20Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Other evidence implicates PML-NBs in the control of gene expression (21Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and as a potent growth suppressor by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest (22Le X.F. Vallian S. Mu Z.M. Hung M.C. Chang K.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HIPK2 is also localized into the PML-NBs with PML-IV (7D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Coen S. Marchetti A. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Fanciulli M. Appella E. Soddu S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 8Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). We show here that both TP53INP1α and TP53INP1β are also recruited by PML-IV into the PML-NBs and therefore co-localize with HIPK2 and p53 (Fig. 3, a and b). Contrary to PML-IV, PML-L, another splice variant of PML, is unable to recruit HIPK2 and p53 into the PML-NBs (7D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Coen S. Marchetti A. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Fanciulli M. Appella E. Soddu S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 10Fogal V. Gostissa M. Sandy P. Zacchi P. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Pandolfi P.P. Will H. Schneider C. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6185-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that PML-L was also unable to recruit TP53INP1α and TP53INP1β (data not shown). Recruitment by PML-IV of TP53INP1s or HIPK2 within the PML-NBs seems to be independent of p53 because it occurs in p53–/– MEFs (data not shown). Finally, control experiments using MEF (showing endogenous nuclear bodies) revealed a faint colocalization signal for nuclear bodies and TP53INP1s. As expected, overexpression of PML-IV in MEF also induces a strong TP53INP1s recruitment into the PML-NBs (Fig. 3c). Taken together, these results demonstrate that PML-IV isoform recruit p53, HIPK2, and both TP53INP1α and TP53INP1β into PML-NBs. The interactions between these proteins may be facilitated or promoted by such a co-localization, which may also help positioning the resulting complex near its site of action. TP53INP1s and HIPK2 Modify p53 Trans-activation Activity—Under normal conditions, p53 is a short-lived protein, tightly regulated and maintained at a low and sometimes undetectable level (23Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). After stress, p53 is activated mostly at the post-translational level by a complex series of modifications including phosphorylation and acetylation of specific residues, protein-protein interactions, and subcellular relocalization (24Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 25Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). p53 activation leads to the transcription of several genes of which the products can trigger a variety of important biological processes such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, replicative senescence, or differentiation (26Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). To control accurately such a variety of mechanisms, the p53 effects on transcription must be highly dependent on the promoter context, type of stimulus, and cellular environment (27Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We suggest that TP53INP1s are involved in such a regulation. To further characterize their functional relevance to HIPK2 and p53 with respect to p53-dependent transcription, we used p53–/– MEFs as a model to exclude endogenous p53 synthesis. Their transfection together with a p53-expressing vector and a plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene controlled by multimers of the intact p53-binding site (p53-TA-Luc) allowed the monitoring of p53 transcriptional activity. Then p53–/– MEFs were transfected with vectors expressing TP53INP1α-V5 or TP53INP1β-V5 either alone or in combination with HIPK2-FLAG. Fig. 4 shows that HIPK2 increased p53 transcriptional activity as demonstrated previously (8Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). TP53INP1α or TP53INP1β expressions also increased p53 trans-activation activity more than 2-fold. A dose-dependent effect was observed (data not shown). Surprisingly, TP53INP1 co-expression with HIPK2 resulted in a reduction of p53 activity indicating a functional interaction. Similar results were obtained using HeLa and SW480 cells (data not shown). We concluded that TP53INP1s regulate p53 transcriptional activity and that HIPK2 might participate in this regulation. To further support this hypothesis, we conducted similar experiments using the luciferase reporter gene under the control of several p53-responding promoters (p21, mdm2, bax, and pig3) instead of the p53-binding site (Fig. 5). p53 activation of p21, mdm2, and bax promoters was increased to various extents by TP53INP1α and TP53INP1β, contrary to the pig3 promoter, which was not activated. The most noticeable was the p21 promoter, in which p53-dependent expression was increased more than 5-fold by TP53INP1α and more than 4-fold by TP53INP1β. HIPK2 alone did not influence p53 transcriptional activity on p21 and mdm2 promoters, abolished the TP53INP1 stimulation of p21 promoter, and enhanced that of mdm2 promoter. p53-mediated activation of the bax promoter was increased by TP53INP1s and HIPK2 without further influence on their co-expression. Finally, TP53INP1 expression, which did not alter the p53 activity on the pig3 promoter, prevented its activation by HIPK2. Similar results were obtained using other cell lines such as HeLa, SW480, and HEK 293 (data not shown). As a control, we monitored by Western blotting the expression of p21 protein in MEF p53–/–. Expression was increased by TP53INP1α and by TP53INP1β, but HIPK2 expression prevented such activation (Fig. 6). These results are in agreement with our results from the transient transfection experiments described above. Nevertheless it is important to note that transfection with pHIPK2 resulted in a decreased induction of p21 by p53 (Fig. 6, row 3, top).Fig. 5Modulation of p53 transcriptional activity by TP53INP1s is promoter-specific. p53–/– MEFs were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter gene construct controlled by one of the following promoters, p21 (p21-Luc), mdm2 (pmdm2-Luc), pig3 (pPIG3-Luc), and bax (pBax-Luc), and one of the following expression vectors, pcDNA-Hu-p53wt, pTP53INP1α-V5 or pTP53INP1β-V5, and pHIPK2-Flag. Results were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Reporter gene activation induced by pcDNA-Hu-p53wt was arbitrarily set at 100%. Results are expressed as mean values ± S.D. for at least three independent transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Induction of p21WAF1 expression by TP53INP1s is blocked by HIPK2. p53–/– MEFs were transfected with combinations of pTP53INP1α-V5, pTP53INP1β-V5, pcDNA-Hu-p53wt, and pHIPK2-FLAG as indicated. p21WAF1 and tubulin expressions were then monitored by immunoblotting. pcDNA4 empty vector was used as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Altogether, these data indicate that p53 transcriptional activity on p53-responsive promoters is regulated by HIPK2 and TP53INP1s. The direction and intensity of the changes can be different depending on the promoter used but not on the cell line studied. Intracellular levels of TP53INP1s and HIPK2 strongly influence p53 activity. Differences in p53 activities on different promoters might be attributed in part to different levels of TP53INP1s and HIPK2. TP53INP1s and HIPK2 Are Involved in p53-mediated Regulation of Cell Cycle and Apoptosis—Our results show that TP53INP1s and HIPK2 can regulate the p53 activity on genes involved in cell cycle regulation (mdm2 and p21) and apoptosis (pig3 and bax). We therefore analyzed by flow cytometry the consequences of their overexpression in HEK 293 cells on the cell cycle and apoptosis (Fig. 7a). As a control, cells were transfected with pCMV/GFP empty expression plasmid. After 24 h, transfection with either pTP53INP1α-GFP or pTP53INP1β-GFP resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of cells in G1 phase (71.1 and 69.5%, respectively, versus 55.5% in control cells) indicating a G1 cell cycle arrest. In agreement with previous results (1Tomasini R. Samir A.A. Vaccaro M.I. Pebusque M.J. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Dusetti N.J. J. Biol.

Overexpression of HIPK2 also enhances sub-G1 phase arrest (from 5.9 to 8.8%) as reported previously (7D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Coen S.

Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In contrast with TP53INP1s, HIPK2 produced a moderate and reproducible increase in the percentage of cells in G2/M phase (from 28.4 to 31.6%) as well as a decreased percentage of cells in G1 phase (from 55.5 to 46.8%). An increased percentage in G2/M was reported previously, but that result was not discussed by the authors (7D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Coen S.

Finally, when one of the TP53INP1s was overexpressed alone, the percentage of cells in G1 phase was higher than when HIPK2 was co-expressed. With TP53INP1α, the proportion of cells in G2/M phase was increased concomitantly, suggesting a competition between the two proteins in the regulation of p53 activity. By contrast, the effects of TP53INP1s and HIPK2 on apoptosis were additive. Similar results in the cell cycle and apoptosis were found in mouse embryo fibroblasts (data not shown), suggesting that the partnership of TP53INP1s with HIPK2 is not cell type-specific. We next used RKO cells, which allow expression of either TP53INP1α-GFP or TP53INP1β-GFP alone or in combination with HIPK2-FLAG. Their activity was monitored by colony formation assay. As a control, RKO cells were transfected with pLxSP and pCMV/GFP empty vectors. As shown in Fig. 7b, cells transfected with the empty vector formed abundant colonies. On the contrary, the number of colonies formed by cells overexpressing either pTP53INP1α or pTP53INP1β was drastically reduced. A smaller number of colonies was further seen upon transfection of either pTP53INP1α or pTP53INP1β plasmid in combination with pHIPK2. HEK 293 cells were also transfected with either pTP53INP1α-GFP or pTP53INP1β-GFP (alone or in combination with pHIPK2-FLAG) or with the pCMV/GFP expression plasmid as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were analyzed by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy for typical morphological features of apoptosis including significant membrane blebbing, vacuolization, and nuclear condensation. As shown in Fig. 7c, the number of GFP-positive cells showing morphological features of apoptosis was greater in cells transfected with either pTP53INP1α-GFP or pTP53INP1β-GFP plasmids than in control cells. The apoptotic cell status was confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL; data not shown). Altogether, these data suggest that TP53INP1s and HIPK2 influence p53 activity and play a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. We thank Drs. M. L. Schmitz for pHIPK2-FLAG plasmid, M.

Its pleiotropic actions arise presumably by interaction with their cell surface G protein-coupled receptors. Herein, the presence of the specific nuclear lysophosphatidic acid receptor-1 (LPA1R) was revealed in unstimulated porcine cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (pCMVECs), LPA1R stably transfected HTC4 rat hepatoma cells, and rat liver tissue using complementary approaches, including radioligand binding experiments, electron- and cryomicroscopy, cell fractionation, and immunoblotting with three distinct antibodies. Coimmunoprecipitation studies in enriched plasmalemmal fractions of unstimulated pCMVEC showed that LPA1Rs are dually sequestrated in caveolin-1 and clathrin subcompartments, whereas in nuclear fractions LPA1R appeared primarily in caveolae. Immunofluorescent assays using a cell-free isolated nuclear system confirmed LPA1R and caveolin-1 co-localization. In pCMVEC, LPA-stimulated increases in cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric-oxide synthase RNA and protein expression were insensitive to caveolea-disrupting agents but sensitive to LPA-generating phospholipase A2 enzyme and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Moreover, LPA-induced increases in Ca2+ transients and/or iNOS expression in highly purified rat liver nuclei were prevented by pertussis toxin, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt inhibitor wortmannin and Ca2+ chelator and channel blockers EGTA and SK&F96365, respectively.

An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 2Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 3Tigyi G. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These plethora of activities are characteristic features of inflammation that occur in various physiological as well as pathological states (e.g. ontogenic change, wound healing, cancer, etc.) (1Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 2Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 3Tigyi G. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In humans, physiological responses induced by LPA arise from specific interactions with at least three genetically identified receptors designated LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 (formerly referred to as EDG2, EDG4, and EDG7 receptors, respectively), which belong to the heptahelical transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily (4Chun J. Goetzl E.J. Hla T. Igarashi Y. Lynch K.R. Moolenaar W. Pyne S. Tigyi G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). These receptors show a broad, virtually distinct distribution and may couple in a cell-dependent manner to numerous heterotrimeric G proteins. In this context, LPA1 and LPA2 receptors have been shown to interact with Gi/o, Gq/11/14, and G12/13 proteins, whereas the LPA3 receptor combines with Gi/o and Gq/11/14 proteins (5Fukushima N. Ishii I. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 507-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although many responses induced by extracellular LPA can result from its interaction with plasma membrane GPCRs, there is circumstantial evidence for an intracrine mode of action of LPA. For instance, putative biogenesis (e.g. secretory and cytosolic calcium-dependent and -independent phospholipase A2, phospholipase D, and monoacylglycerol kinase) and degradation (e.g. phosphohydrolase and lysophospholipase) pathways for LPA have been detected at the nuclear membrane and/or within the nucleus of targeted cells (6Baker R.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9358-9365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further support for the functionality of constitutive intracellular LPA receptors, specifically at the cell nucleus, is revealed by adjacent localization of required signaling effectors, which couple to the receptors. These accessory proteins include, among others, G proteins, ion channels, phospholipases A2, C, and D, adenylate cyclase, MAPKs, and NF-κB (see Ref. 12Gobeil Jr., F. Vazquez-Tello A. Marrache A.M. Bhattacharya M. Checchin D. Bkaily G. Lachapelle P. Ribeiro-Da-Silva A. Chemtob S. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2003; 81: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar for review). Alternatively, LPA may exert intracellular actions by generating its own formation, inferring possible active intracellular binding sites. Along this line of thought, LPA signaling at discrete subcellular domains may be provided in part by intracellular conveyors such as gelsolin and the fatty acid-binding protein (8Pagès C. Simon M.F. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 1-10Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar), by uptake of extracellular LPA bound to albumin (via albondin receptor; gp60) (13Tiruppathi C. Finnegan A. Malik A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and/or to lipocalins (14Bratt T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Lastly, several established pathways of GPCR regulation and desensitization driven by extracellular agonists have also been implicated in their intracellular relocalization, which results in delayed complementary signaling cascades (15Sarret P. Nouel D. Dal Farra C. Vincent J.P. Beaudet A. Mazella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19294-19300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, accumulating evidence suggests that nuclear translocation of peptide growth factors (e.g. angiogenin, PDGF, basic FGF, EGF, and PTH) and/or their integral membrane receptors, is mandatory for gene transcription associated with proliferating/growth events (17Re R. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because most of these latter receptors (e.g. EGF, PDGF, and PTH receptors) co-localize within caveolae (18Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), we speculated that translocation to this specific organelle proceeds via receptor endocytosis through the caveolar compartment. Whether this phenomenon holds true for the transmission of LPA gene responses (1Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 2Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) is not yet known.The biochemical mechanisms by which GPCRs, including LPA-Rs, modulate gene transcription are complex and not fully understood (19Pierce K.L. Lutrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Some mechanisms recently uncovered to explain GPCR-mediated gene induction implicate an endocytosis-associated β-arrestin-c-Src interaction leading to downstream activation of Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) through possibly metalloprotease-dependent transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) involving de novo release of their ligand (19Pierce K.L. Lutrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Herein, we postulated that endogenous LPA stimulates gene expression, specifically the pro-inflammatory genes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), through a formerly undescribed mechanism, which involves the activation of nuclear LPA receptors that pre-exist at the nuclear envelope or originate from the internalization/endocytosis of plasmalemmal LPA receptors. In the present study, we focused on endothelial cells, which are known to express predominantly LPA1R (20Lee H. Goetzl E.J. An S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C612-C618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and consolidated our findings on LPA1R stably transfected HTC4 rat hepatoma cells (21An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and rat liver tissue specimens. Our in vitro and in vivo findings support the existence of constitutive LPA1R at the cell nucleus, which upon stimulation mediates calcium transients and transcriptional signals of immediate-early response genes. Our results also suggest that (i) LPA-induced PLA2-dependent COX-2 expression is not reliant on prostaglandin, leukotriene, or epoxide production and (ii) contrary to common peptide growth hormone receptors, the sequestration and transcellular transport of LPA-R via caveolae to the nucleus is not a prerequisite for LPA-R activity on gene expression. This study unravels an as yet undescribed mechanism by which LPA modulates gene expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemical Reagents and Antibodies—Materials and chemicals were obtained from the following sources: oleyl-, stereoyl-, palmitoyl-lysophophatidic acids (LPA); dioleoyl-phosphatidic acid, oleoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine, oleoyl-lysophosphatidylglycerol, oleoyl-lysophosphatidylserine, and oleoyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Birmingham, AL); (C16)-PAF (Cayman); 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, Nonidet P-40, filipin, thapsigargin, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, ibuprofen (Sigma); EGTA, pertussis toxin (PTX), fura-2-AM, wortmannin, ionomycin, MK886, cytidine-5-diphosphocholine, mepacrine, tyrphostin AG 1478, PD 98059, and tunicamycin (Calbiochem); SK&F96365, CV 3988, and methylcarbamyl platelet-activating factor (C-PAF) (BIOMOL); ketoconazole (ICN Biochemicals Inc.); fluo-4-AM (Molecular Probes); PNGase F assay kit (New England BioLabs); brain microvessel endothelial growth media (BioWhittaker); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen); [3H]oLPA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); RNA guard RNase inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences); and recombinant human interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (BIOSOURCE International).

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) were cultured and passaged, as previously reported. Cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin G, 1% streptomycin and used between passages 6-13 at ∼80% confluency unless otherwise stated. Prior to stimulation, cells were serum-starved overnight. Isolation of nuclei was achieved by cell fractionation using the hypotonic/Nonidet P-40 lysis method (27Gobeil Jr., F. Dumont I. Marrache A.M. Vazquez-Tello A. Bernier S.G. Abran D. Hou X. Beauchamp M.H. Quiniou C. Bouayad A. Choufani S. Bhattacharya M. Molotchnikoff S. Ribeiro-Da-Silva A. Varma D.R. Bkaily G. Chemtob S. Circ.

Nuclear envelopes were prepared by incubating nuclear suspensions (8 × 106 nuclei/ml) with DNase I (800 units, pancreas type II, Roche Applied Science) and RNase A (32 mg/ml, Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C (28Kaufmann S.H.

Supernatants of homogenized cells (in lysis buffer) were sequentially centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min then 120,000 × g for 60 min to obtain mitochondrial and plasma membrane fractions, respectively. Plasma and nuclear membranes and intact nuclei were stored at -80 °C unless otherwise stated. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford protein assay using BSA as standard. The morphological integrity and purity (>98%) was routinely assessed by light microscopy after trypan blue staining and confirmed by electron microscopy (27Gobeil Jr., F. Dumont I. Marrache A.M.

The plasma membrane marker 5′-nucleotidase activity (Sigma assay kit) in nuclear versus plasma membrane fraction was less than 7%.Isolation of Subcellular Fractions of Rat Liver—Hepatocytes were harvested following digestion of liver with collagenase (type II, 0.05%, Sigma), as described (29Nanji A.A. Rahemtulla A. Maio L. Khwaja S. Zhao S. Tahan S.R. Thomas P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1037-1043PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of liver nuclei was carried out by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose gradient according to Nicotera et al. (30Nicotera P. McConkey D.J. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane microsomes and nuclear envelopes were prepared, and morphological integrity and purity were ascertained as indicated above; 5′-nucleotidase activity endowed in the isolated nuclear fraction was less than 2% of that of plasma membrane fraction. Purity of subcellular fractions was further substantiated by means of immunological methods using the specific organelle marker antigens alkaline phosphatase and CD51 (plasma membrane), lamin A/C (nuclei), and cytochrome c (mitochondria, cytosol), as depicted below in Fig. 1A. Fig. 1B exhibits electron micrographs of highly purified nuclei (>98%) and prepared nuclear envelopes (right panel), appearing as intact spheres, following this isolation procedure.Radioligand Binding Assays—Cells were seeded into 24-well plates (500 μl of media/well) and allowed to reach 90% confluency (∼70,000 cells/well) before beginning experiments. Quiescent cells were washed thrice with PBS containing BSAfaf (0.1%), soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) then incubated in the same buffer at 4 °C for 90 min with 10 nm radioactive tracer [3H]oLPA (50 Ci/mmol). Thereafter, cells were rinsed twice with cold incubation buffer (1 ml), lysed with sodium hydroxide (0.1 n), and transferred into scintillation vials. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of unlabeled LPA (10 μm). Radioactivity of samples was measured with a β-counter. In parallel, cells from untreated wells within the same plate were harvested with trypsin and counted thrice with a hemacytometer for cell count normalization.Subcellular Fractions—Binding assays were conducted on either whole nuclei or nuclear envelopes originating from porcine EC and rat liver using 10 nm radioactive tracer [3H]oLPA. Thawed rat liver nuclei (5 × 106 nuclei corresponding to ∼250 μg of protein) and prepared envelopes (5 × 106 nuclear envelope corresponding to ∼100 μg of protein) were resuspended in buffer consisting of Trizma-HCl (50 mm), pH 7.4, KCl (25 mm), MgCl2 (5 mm), sucrose (0.25 mm), CuSO4 (0.5 mm), BSAfaf (0.1%); pCMVEC-isolated nuclei (0.15 × 106 nuclei/100 μg of protein) in Trizma-HCl (20 mm), pH 7.4, KCl (10 mm), MgCl2 (3 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), BSAfaf (0.1%). The reaction was terminated by diluting samples (twice with a 40× volume excess) followed by rapid filtration on GF/C filters presoaked in incubation buffer supplemented with BSAfaf (1%). In each experiment, nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of unlabeled LPA or surrogates (10 μm). Under these experimental conditions, the level of binding was directly proportional to time exposure (equilibrium time ∼ 60 min) or the amount of proteins added (50-400 μg) (not shown).Western Blot Analysis of LPA 1 R—Equal amounts (25 μg) of plasma membrane (PM), whole nuclei (WN), and derived nuclear envelope (NE) protein from pCMVEC, HTC4, and hepatocyte cells were solubilized in Laemmli buffer, separated by 12% reducing SDS-PAGE, and electro-blotted onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) (TBS-T) and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C either with a monoclonal anti-LPA1R-N (1:100), a polyclonal anti-LPA1R-N (1:2000), or a polyclonal anti-LPA1R-C (1: 2000). Thereafter, membranes were washed with TBS-T and incubated for 1 h at RT with secondary antibodies (monoclonal, 1:2500; polyclonal, 1:5000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Finally, membranes were thoroughly washed and developed using an enhanced plus ECL system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In some experiments, the effects of the N-glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, and the endoglycosidase PNG-ase F were evaluated on cultured pCMVECs and an enriched plasmalemmal fraction of rat liver, respectively. These experiments were based on the presence of putative glycosylation consensus sequences (NX(S/T)) residing in rat (27NES29; 35NES37) and human (27NES29; 35NRS37) LPA1R orthologues (31Allard J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). For this purpose, pCMVEC were treated or not with tunicamycin (0.05, 0.5, or 1.0 μg/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, complete protease mixture inhibitor, and solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C using a rotary shaker. Cellular extracts were centrifuged (21,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was collected and proteins were measured. For deglycosylation experiments, 50 μg of rat liver PM was denatured and incubated or not with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (500,000 units/ml; 5 μl) at 37 °C for 5 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples (10-50 μg of proteins) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (9-12%), transferred onto PVDF membranes, and blotted with a polyclonal anti-LPA1R-N antibody (1:4000).Electron and Cryomicroscopic Immunohistochemistry of LPA 1 R— Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were used. Rat liver tissue sectioning and pre-embedding immunogold staining was done as described in detail previously (33Ribeiro-Da-Silva A. Priestley J.V. Cuello C. Cuello A.C. Immunohistochemistry II. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 182-210Google Scholar). Vibratome sections (50 μm) of liver were incubated with the primary antibody (a rabbit anti-LPA1R-C antibody) (1:50) overnight at 4 °C followed by another overnight incubation with goat anti-rabbit gold (10 nm)-conjugated IgG (1:50) (British Biocell International). In control sections, the primary antibody was either removed or pre-absorbed with its cognate peptide (10-fold excess by weight, Upstate Biotechnology). Thereafter, specimens were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, subsequently dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in Epon according to standard technique. Ultrathin sections were cut using a Reichert Ultracut ultramicrotome, mounted on Formvar-coated copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead nitrate, and examined with a transmission electron microscope (Philips 410LS, Netherlands).Electron Cryomicroscopy—All procedures were based on previously reported methods (34Dahan S. Ahluwalia J.P. Wong L. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Rat liver sections were cut at -100 °C in an FC4D cryochamber using a Reichert-Jung ultramicrotome and transferred to Formvar-coated copper grids. For immunolabeling assays, sections were incubated for 30 min at RT with rabbit polyclonal anti-human LPA1R-N or -C antibody (1:10) followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit gold (10 nm)-conjugated IgG (1:20) (Sigma Chemical Co.). Negative controls were analyzed by omitting primary antibodies. Frozen sections were contrasted and embedded as described (35Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J.

Double staining was achieved by incubating the nuclear suspension (1 h at RT) with a polyclonal rabbit anti-LPA1R-N (1:50) and a monoclonal mouse anti-caveolin-1 antibody (1:25). The nuclear suspension was diluted in a 5-fold excess of blocking buffer then centrifuged (800 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in similar buffer. The nuclei were subsequently incubated 60 min with a goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488-conjugated IgG (2 μg/ml) and a chicken anti-mouse AlexaFluor 647-conjugated IgG (10 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes) and washed as indicated above. The nuclear suspension was then placed on poly-l-ornithine-treated glass coverslips (25 mm) and examined with a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Samples were imaged using a 60× differential interference contrast oil immersion objective lens on a Nikon TE300 microscope with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal accessory. The two images were collected by using the same Z values and were merged using a Silicone graphic (SGI) software. Nuclear staining was realized at the end of the experiment using the DNA dye Syto-11 (100 nm) (Molecular Probes). For negative controls the primary antibodies were omitted.Immunoprecipitation of LPA 1 R and Western Blotting—Cellular and nuclear extracts (500 μg) of pCMVEC were lysed, immunoprecipitated by an anti-LPA1R-N polyclonal antibody (4 μg/ml), separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed with either an anti-LPA1R-N polyclonal antibody (serving as positive control) (1:2000), anti-clathrin (1:1000), or caveolin-1 (1:1000) monoclonal antibody. Cellular and nuclear extracts of EC were subjected to extraction in Triton X-100 followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation to isolate caveolae (35Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Caveolae-enriched fractions (low density and Triton X-100-insoluble materials) were verified by SDS-PAGE and probed for caveolin-1. Equal amounts of proteins from caveolar and non-caveolar membranes were then immunoblotted for LPA1R as indicated above.Western Blot of COX-2 and iNOS Proteins—pCMVEC were seeded into 10-cm dishes, rendered quiescent with starving medium, and treated for 6 h with either the vehicle (bidistilled and d"

Observations that endostatin inhibits endothelial cell migration and induces disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton provide putative cellular mechanisms for this effect. To understand the mechanisms of endostatin-induced intracellular signaling, we analyzed the association of recombinant endostatin with endothelial cell lipid rafts and the roles of its heparin- and integrin-binding properties in this interaction. We observed that a fraction of cell surface-bound endostatin partitioned in low density membrane raft fractions together with caveolin-1. Heparinase treatment of cells prevented the recruitment of endostatin to the lipid rafts but did not affect the association of endostatin with the non-raft fraction, whereas preincubation of endostatin with soluble α5β1 integrin prevented the association of endostatin with the endothelial cell membrane. Endostatin treatment induced recruitment of α5β1 integrin into the raft fraction via a heparan sulfate proteoglycan-dependent mechanism. Subsequently, through α5β1 integrin, heparan sulfate, and lipid raft-mediated interactions, endostatin induced Src-dependent activation of p190RhoGAP with concomitant decrease in RhoA activity and disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. These observations provide a cell biological mechanism, which plausibly explains the anti-angiogenic mechanisms of endostatin in vivo.

The growth of solid tumors and their metastases is dependent on angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries from pre-existing vessels.

However, the mechanisms of signal transduction via these receptors to the cytoplasm are incompletely defined. Glycosphingolipid/cholesterol-containing lipid rafts are specialized membrane microdomains, which serve as foci for the recruitment of transmembrane proteins and intracellular signaling molecules at the plasma membrane (17Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8091) Google Scholar). Several membrane proteins such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HDMEC, human dermal microvascular endothelial cell; hep III, heparinase III; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; sol-α5β1, soluble α5β1 integrin; sol-α3β1, soluble α3β1 integrin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer.1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HDMEC, human dermal microvascular endothelial cell; hep III, heparinase III; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; sol-α5β1, soluble α5β1 integrin; sol-α3β1, soluble α3β1 integrin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer.-anchored proteins or caveolin, as well as cytoplasmic proteins such as Src family kinases, are enriched in rafts (18Anderson R.G.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Recruitment of transmembrane receptors such as integrins into rafts promotes their interaction with local kinases and phosphatases in the new microenvironment, resulting in downstream signaling (20Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5150) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which the recruitment occurs have remained largely unknown, although various models have been proposed (21Anderson R.G. Jacobson K. Science. 2002; 296: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 22Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts can evidently associate with the actin-rich regions of the cell and harbor proteins involved in the regulation of these structures (23Michaely P.A. Mineo C. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21430-21436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). One of the molecules involved is RhoA, a member of the Rho family of GTPases. Members of the Rho family of proteins regulate the coordinated alterations in cell-matrix interactions with repeated cycles of cell adhesion and detachment resulting in cell migration (24Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3728) Google Scholar, 25Ridley A.J. Hall A.

RhoA cycles between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state and regulates the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers. These, in turn, are anchored to the cytoplasmic tails of ligand-bound integrins (28Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). Inactivation of RhoA is stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which increase the intrinsic GTPase activity of small G-proteins (29Foster R. Hu K.Q. Shaywitz D.A. Settleman J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Chang J.H. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Zhang K. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 959-967PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chang J.H.

The current work was carried out to investigate the association of endostatin with specific membrane microdomains on the surface of endothelial cells. We found that exogenous recombinant endostatin localized to lipid rafts through heparan sulfate proteoglycan and integrin-mediated interactions, and that the raft localization was indispensable for the downstream signaling by endostatin. In addition, endostatin treatment induced loss of actin stress fibers through Src-dependent activation of p190RhoGAP and subsequent down-regulation of RhoA activity. These events play potentially important roles in the action of endostatin. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant human endostatin was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human endostatin were from Chemicon Inc. (Temecula, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibodies were from Sigma Chemical Co. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against caveolin-1 and mouse monoclonal antibodies against p190 and transferrin receptor were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against glypican-1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Cell Culture and Treatment with Chemicals—Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) were purchased from Promocell (Heidelberg, Germany) and were cultured in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (Promocell), at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells used for the experiments were from passages 3–6. All experiments were carried out under serum-free conditions, in which the cells were washed twice and incubated in serum-free medium-199 for at least 8 h prior to treatment with the various proteins or chemicals. Where indicated, the cells were pretreated with heparinase III from Flavobacterium heparinum (Sigma) for 30 min prior to the addition of recombinant endostatin. The amount of heparinase used is expressed as conventional units. To saturate the putative integrin binding sites of recombinant endostatin, 50 nm endostatin was preincubated with purified soluble α5β1 integrin (5 μg/ml, 33 nm; Chemicon) in phosphate-buffered saline·Ca/Mg (PBS·Ca/Mg; 170 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) at +4 °C for 12 h. Subsequently the buffer containing the two proteins was applied to the cells and incubated for time points indicated. The interaction of the two proteins in vitro has been described previously (15Rehn M. Veikkola T. Kukk-Valdre E. Nakamura H. Ilmonen M. Lombardo C. Pihlajaniemi T. Alitalo K. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and was confirmed by us using a solid phase ligand-binding assay (see below). Preparation of Low Density Membrane Fractions—Cells were treated with 50 nm endostatin for 20 min and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5). Cell extracts were homogenized using a 22-gauge needle and adjusted to a final density of 40% by the addition of OptiPrep Density Gradient Medium (Sigma). Samples were placed in a centrifuge tube and overlaid with a discontinuous 30%/5% OptiPrep density gradient. Samples were then centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 18 h, after which 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (32Taipale J. Koli K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25378-25384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solid Phase Ligand Binding Assay—96-well plates were coated with 33 nm purified α5β1 integrin at 4 °C for 12 h. Nonspecific binding sites were then saturated with 5% bovine serum albumin at +22 °C for 1 h. Endostatin was then added in PBS·Ca/Mg at concentrations indicated in the figure and incubated at +37 °C for 3 h. Unbound protein was removed by washing the wells with 0.01% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Bound protein was detected with antibodies against human endostatin, peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, and its substrate, diluted in 0.05% Tween-20 in TBS, containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Bound antibody was quantitated by measuring absorbance at a 450-nm wavelength. Immunofluorescence—Cells cultured on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 10 min. Nonspecific protein binding sites were saturated with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then washed with PBS, and incubated with monoclonal antibodies against vinculin for 1 h. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) was used to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. Unbound proteins were removed by washing, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h. The coverslips were finally washed and mounted on glass slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The fluorescent images were obtained using an epifluorescent microscope. Affinity Precipitation of GTP-Rho—GTP-Rho affinity precipitation assays were performed essentially according to Ren et al. (33Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Briefly, HDMECs treated with the indicated chemicals were washed with icecold TBS and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml aminoethylbenzenesulphonyl fluoride. The lysates were then incubated with Rhotekin Rho binding domain-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at 4 °C for 45 min and washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml aminoethylbenzenesulphonyl fluoride. The bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer (4% SDS in 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and detected by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz). Intensity of RhoA signal was quantified from scanned immunoblots using Adobe Photoshop software. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed with RIPA-DOC lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aminoethylbenzene sulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride) and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were preabsorbed by incubation with preimmune serum and gamma-bind Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C in an end-over-end mixer for 2 h. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against p190 on ice for 1 h. Gamma-bind Sepharose was then added and the samples were incubated in an end-over-end mixer at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were subsequently collected by centrifugation and washed three times with RIPA-DOC buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C and separated by 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions, transferred onto nitrocellulose and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Intensities of the detected bands were quantified from scanned immunoblots using Adobe Photoshop software. Endostatin Associates with Triton X-100-insoluble Membrane Fractions—Membrane rafts are characterized by their resistance to detergent solubilization at low temperatures and light buoyant density. This allows isolation of a light glycolipid-enriched membrane fraction using Triton-X flotation gradients (34Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 35Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Recombinant endostatin administered to endothelial cells associates with caveolin-1, a marker protein for a subclass of lipid rafts (11Wickström S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5580-5589PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether this interaction involves the association of endostatin with the lipid rafts, we isolated Triton-X-100 insoluble membrane fractions of cells treated with 50 nm endostatin (1 μg/ml) using a discontinuous OptiPrep density gradient. Proteins associated with low density lipid rafts migrate to the interface of 5 and 30% OptiPrep layers (35Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). We found that a fraction of endostatin localized in the caveolin- and glypican-1 -enriched top fractions of the flotation gradient, indicating raft localization (Fig. 1A, fraction 3). Transferrin receptor was used as a marker for the non-raft fractions (36Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). To assess the role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the cell surface association of recombinant endostatin, cells were pretreated with heparinase III for 30 min prior to the addition of endostatin. Treatment of cells with heparinase III (5 milliunits/ml) for 30 min prior to the addition of endostatin significantly reduced the amount of endostatin associated with the low density fractions without appreciably affecting the levels of endostatin associated in the non-raft fraction. No changes in the distribution of caveolin-1 or transferrin receptor in the raft and non-raft fractions were observed in the heparinase-treated cells. The antibody used did not detect glypican-1 from the raft fractions after heparinase III treatment, which was most likely due to efficient cleavage of the heparan sulfate side chains of the protein (Fig. 1B). To investigate the role of α5β1 integrin in the cell surface association of endostatin, recombinant endostatin (1 μg/ml, 50 nm) was preincubated with purified soluble α5β1 integrin (5 μg/ml, 33 nm) for 12 h to saturate the putative integrin binding sites of endostatin. Endostatin preincubated with soluble integrin α5β1 displayed decreased association with both high and low density fractions of the cell membrane (Fig. 1C). To confirm that soluble integrin α5β1 interacts directly with endostatin, solid-phase ligand binding assay was performed. The analysis revealed that immobilized, purified α5β1 integrin bound endostatin in a saturable and dose-dependent manner, and that saturation was reached beyond the 50 nm concentration of endostatin (Fig. 1D). No effects on the association of endostatin with the membrane fractions were seen with non-interacting soluble α3β1 integrin (5 μg/ml) or chondroitin sulfate (10 μg/ml)(Fig. 1E). Endostatin Treatment Induces Association of Integrin α 5 β 1 with Lipid Rafts—Several integrins can interact with the lipid raft scaffold protein caveolin-1 (37Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 38Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). It has, however, been unclear whether this interaction occurs in lipid rafts. We have previously observed that endostatin treatment induces marked relocation of α5β1 integrin into membrane clusters distinct from the focal adhesions, with concomitant association of these two proteins with caveolin-1 (11Wickström S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5580-5589PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether endostatin induces the translocation of the α5β1 integrin to the lipid rafts, we prepared Triton-X-100 flotation gradients from the membranes of HDMECs and collected 8 fractions. Based on the distribution of the raft marker protein caveolin-1 and the non-raft marker protein transferrin receptor in these fractions we pooled fractions 3–5 and 7–8 and marked these fractions as raft and non-raft, respectively. These pools were then analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies against α5β1 integrin and caveolin-1 and with monoclonal antibodies against the transferrin receptor. Very low levels of α5β1 integrin were visible in the raft fraction of the untreated control cells, while the non-raft fraction displayed intensive staining. In endostatin treated cells, the levels of α5β1 integrin in the raft fraction were increased compared with control cells (Fig. 2A, upper panel). When cells were pretreated with heparinase III (5 milliunits/ml) for 30 min prior to the addition of endostatin, the amount of α5β1 integrin in the raft fraction was decreased to the level of control cells (Fig. 2, upper panel). The treatments had no effect on the distribution of caveolin-1, which was observed almost exclusively in the raft fraction (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Transferrin receptor staining was restricted to the non-raft fraction (Fig. 2A, middle panel). Quantification of the scanned immunoblots revealed a >2-fold increase in the ratio of raft versus non-raft associated α5β1 integrin in endostatin-treated cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2B). Endostatin Induces Phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP and Down-regulation of RhoA Activity—Cell adhesion to extracellular matrices and the concomitant formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers are associated with the up-regulation of RhoA activity (28Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar, 25Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3824) Google Scholar). To investigate whether changes in RhoA activity were associated with the endostatin-induced disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, Rho activity assays were carried out. Endothelial cells treated with increasing concentrations of endostatin for 45 min were washed and lysed, after which the active GTP-binding fraction was isolated using Rhotekin Rho-binding domain affinity precipitation. Immunoblotting analysis of the isolated polypeptides with antibodies against RhoA revealed a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of active RhoA in the endostatin-treated HDMECs (Fig. 3A). We have previously observed that endostatin activates the fraction of Src associated with caveolin-1, and that treatment of endothelial cells with the Src inhibitor PP1 can prevent the disassembly of cytoskeletal structures induced by endostatin (11Wickström S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5580-5589PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the role of Src in the endostatin-induced decrease of RhoA activity, cells were treated with endostatin in combination with PP1. These cells displayed higher levels of active RhoA than the cells treated with endostatin alone (Fig. 3B). Src regulates Rho activity by tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP, a GTPase activating protein with high specificity for Rho (31Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 39Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 40Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To determine whether p190RhoGAP is involved in the endostatin-induced down-regulation of Rho, we analyzed the effect of endostatin on tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP. Endostatin treatment led to an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP as observed by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of cell extracts immunoprecipitated with antibodies against p190. This effect was partly inhibited when PP1 was added to cells in combination with endostatin (Fig. 3C). Lipid Raft Localization Is Required for the Cytoskeletal Effects of Endostatin—To determine whether the association of endostatin with lipid rafts is required for the cytoskeletal effects of endostatin, endostatin was depleted from lipid rafts by treating the cells with the cholesterol-sequestering agent filipin III (2.5 μg/ml) or the cholesterol-chelating agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (5 mm) (41Foster L.J. De Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). After 30 min of treatment endostatin (1 μg/ml) was added and incubated for 15 min. The cells were then lysed in 1% Triton X-100, after which flotation gradients were prepared. Eight fractions were collected and based on the distribution of the raft marker protein caveolin-1 and the non-raft marker protein transferrin receptor we pooled the fractions 3–5 and 7–8 and marked these fractions as raft and non-raft, respectively. These pools were then analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies against endostatin. Analysis of the immunoblots revealed that both filipin III and cyclodextrin treatments inhibited the trans-localization of endostatin into the raft fraction. Caveolin-1 became only slightly redistributed, probably due to the low concentration of the cholesterol binding chemicals used (Fig. 4A). Immunofluorescence analysis of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers was then performed. As observed previously, endostatin treatment led to the disruption of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. However, when the raft localization of endostatin was inhibited using filipin III treatment, the fibers and focal adhesions were comparable to those of control cells. Filipin III had no independent effects on the cytoskeletal structures (Fig. 4B). Both Integrins and Heparan Sulfates Are Involved in Mediating the Cytoskeletal Effects of Endostatin—To further explore the roles of integrin α5β1 and heparan sulfates in the endostatin-induced cytoskeletal disassembly, cells were incubated with endostatin (50 nm) in the presence of soluble integrin α5β1 (33 nm) or pretreated with heparinase III (5 mU/ml) for 30 min prior to the addition of endostatin. Subsequently, RhoA activity assays as well as immunofluorescence analysis of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers were carried out. In cells pretreated with heparinase III for 30 min before the addition of recombinant endostatin, no down-regulation of RhoA activity was seen (Fig. 5A). In addition, in contrast to the endostatin-treated cells, which lacked actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, cells pretreated with heparinase III before the addition of endostatin displayed intact stress fibers and distinct focal adhesions comparable to untreated control cells (Fig. 5B). Saturation of integrin binding sites with preincubation of endostatin with soluble α5β1 reverted the activity levels of RhoA to the level of control cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, intact focal adhesions and actin stress fibers were seen in cells that were treated with endostatin preincubated with soluble α5β1 (Fig. 5D). These data indicate that both heparan sulfate proteoglycans and integrin α5β1 modulate the cytoskeletal effects of endostatin. In the current study we have investigated the role of lipid rafts on certain central cell biological effects such as cytoskeletal disassembly induced by human endostatin. To understand the mechanism behind this, we explored changes in RhoA activation as a result of endostatin treatment. The results indicated that endostatin associated with lipid rafts, and that the association involved integrin α5β1-dependent binding of endostatin to the cell surface and heparan sulfate-mediated translocation of integrin α5β1 together with endostatin into the raft fraction. Furthermore, the raft localization as well as interactions of endostatin with both α5β1 integrin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans were found to be essential for the endostatin-induced disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, we observed that endostatin induced Src-dependent phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP with concomitant down-regulation of RhoA activity. The biological role of the endostatin fragment of collagen type XVIII is currently unclear, as mice lacking type XVIII collagen display only a mild vascular phenotype. Furthermore, no effects on tumor growth or tumor angiogenesis have so far been observed in the gene-targeted mice (42Fukai N. Eklund L. Marneros A.G. Oh S.P. Keene D.R. Tamarkin L. Niemela M. Ilves M. Li E. Pihlajaniemi T. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, the concentrations of endostatin used to achieve anti-tumor effects are 10-fold higher than the levels of endostatin in mouse circulation, arguing that the pharmacological effects of high concentrations of endostatin are distinct from its physiological effects. Furthermore, endostatin is sequestered in the basement membranes, where it is not accessible for interaction with cell surface receptors (42Fukai N. Eklund L. Marneros A.G. Oh S.P. Keene D.R. Tamarkin L. Niemela M. Ilves M. Li E. Pihlajaniemi T. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Recent findings have elucidated the dual role of integrins as negative as well as positive regulators of angiogenesis (43Stupack D.G. Puente X.S. Boutsaboualoy S. Storgard C.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 44Reynolds L.E. Wyder L. Lively J.C. Taverna D. Robinson S.D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the inhibitors of angiogenesis that bind integrins would not serve as inhibitors of physiological matrix-integrin signals, but would, instead, act as signaling molecules themselves (45Hynes R.O. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). They would thus induce signals regulating cell growth, survival, and migration specific for these inhibitors. Our observations on the intracellular signals induced by recombinant endostatin resulting in disassembly of cytoskeletal structures support these hypotheses. The current findings implicate lipid rafts as specific sites for endostatin binding and downstream signaling. Both heparan sulfates and α5β1 integrins were required for this association and subsequent intracellular signaling. More specifically, the integrin binding properties of endostatin seemed to regulate the binding of endostatin to the endothelial cell surface, and the heparin-binding capacity would, in turn, translocate α5β1 integrin and endostatin into the lipid rafts. This could occur via a raft-localized heparan sulfate proteoglycan acting as a coreceptor for endostatin. Several heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been found to localize in these rafts (46Carey D.J. Bendt K.M. Stahl R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15253-15260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 47Tkachenko E. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19946-19951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican, a putative cell surface receptor for endostatin, belongs to the GPI-anchored proteins (14Karumanchi S.A. Jha V. Ramchandran R. Karihaloo A. Tsiokas L. Chan B. Dhanabal M. Hanai J.I. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Keiser N. Kalluri R. Zeng H. Mukhopadhyay D. Chen R.L. Lander A.D. Hagihara K. Yamaguchi Y. Sasisekharan R. Cantley L. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which are a major class of proteins in the lipid rafts (48Mayor S. Rothberg K.G. Maxfield F.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1948-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 49Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that glypican and endostatin were localized in the same detergent-insoluble membrane fraction. A role for lipid rafts in endostatin-mediated signaling was additionally underlined by the observation that the raft localization is necessary for the effects of endostatin on the actin cytoskeleton, as removal of endostatin from the raft fraction with Filipin treatment inhibited the endostatin-induced disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. This suggests that the lipid rafts serve as scaffolds for endostatin, integrin α5β1, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans to interact with their specific downstream signaling partners, caveolin-1-bound Src and p190RhoGAP. Membrane lipids have been observed to regulate integrin and integrin-associated protein activity (50Green J.M. Zhelesnyak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 51Pande G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adhesion of cells to fibronectin localizes α5β1 integrin and Src family tyrosine kinase activity in the rafts (52Lacalle R.A. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Jimenez-Baranda S. Martinez A.C. Manes S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These studies have, however, not indicated a role for caveolin-1 or heparan sulfate proteglycans in these rafts. Endostatin associates with both of these proteins, suggesting that the downstream signaling induced by endostatin is not completely analogous to that of fibronectin bound to α5β1 integrin. This is further supported by the observation that, in contrast to soluble endostatin, soluble fibronectin did not induce prolonged down-regulation of RhoA activity. 2S. Wickstrom, unpublished observations. Another possible scenario is that internalization of endostatin is required for its cell biological effects and that this internalization occurs via caveolae or a related raft pathway. There is some evidence for recombinant endostatin being internalized by endothelial cells, but the functional consequences of this process have not been assessed (8Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K. Lu L. Engstrom A. Timpl R. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers by endostatin has previously been observed to involve tyrosyl phosphatase-dependent activation of Src tyrosine kinase (11Wickström S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5580-5589PubMed Google Scholar). The current results identify other proteins potentially involved in this effect, as down-regulation of RhoA activity was observed in endostatin-treated endothelial cells. Interestingly, Src is involved in the transient down-regulation of RhoA activity occurring as the initial event of integrin ligand binding and this is accompanied by disassembly of actin stress fibers (39Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This process promotes plausibly efficient cell spreading and is followed by an increase in Rho activity resulting in reformation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. We found evidence for the involvement of Src in the down-regulation of Rho activity by endostatin. Treatment of cells with the Src inhibitor PP1 in combination with endostatin was found to reduce the ability of endostatin to downregulate RhoA activity. Interestingly, the kinetics of this down-regulation was significantly slower than that resulting from the interaction of deposited fibronectin with integrin α5β1 (39Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), further underlining the exceptional nature of the signals by soluble endostatin. Rho is thought to possess a dual role in the regulation of cell migration. High levels of active Rho inhibit cell migration through promotion of excessive cell adhesion. On the other hand, decreased levels of Rho activity inhibit cell migration probably through disruption of cell-matrix interactions, reducing membrane ruffling and tail-retraction of the migrating cell, and delaying the turnover of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (53Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 54Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol.

Invest. 1997; 100: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Since endostatin induces loss of stress fibers persisting for several hours (10Wickström S.A. Veikkola T. Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6511-6516PubMed Google Scholar), the endostatin-induced down-regulation of RhoA could significantly reduce the speed of endothelial cell migration by delaying the dynamics of actin stress fiber and focal adhesion turnover. Based on these results and previous data we suggest the following mode of action for endostatin (Fig. 6). Endostatin binds α5β1 integrin on the cell surface. Its simultaneous or subsequent interaction with a heparan sulfate proteoglycan leads to the association of endostatin, α5β1 integrin, and caveolin-1 in the lipid rafts. These interactions induce activation of Src tyrosine kinase associated with caveolin-1. Src then phosphorylates and activates p190RhoGAP, which in turn induces inactivation of RhoA. Finally, down-regulation of RhoA activity leads to the disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions resulting in reduced migratory capacity of the endothelial cell. This cascade represents a novel mechanism by which a fragment of the extracellular matrix and an inhibitor of angiogenesis transmits signals to the cytoplasm and regulates cell adhesion.

https://openalex.org/W2151835834,"The Ca(2+)-sensitive dehydrogenases of the mitochondrial matrix are, so far, the only known effectors to allow Ca2+ signals to couple the activation of plasma membrane receptors to the stimulation of aerobic metabolism. In this study, we demonstrate a novel mechanism, based on Ca(2+)-sensitive metabolite carriers of the inner membrane. We expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells aralar1 and citrin, aspartate/glutamate exchangers that have Ca(2+)-binding sites in their sequence, and measured mitochondrial Ca2+ and ATP levels as well as cytosolic Ca2+ concentration with targeted recombinant probes. The increase in mitochondrial ATP levels caused by cell stimulation with Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists was markedly larger in cells expressing aralar and citrin (but not truncated mutants lacking the Ca(2+)-binding site) than in control cells. Conversely, the cytosolic and the mitochondrial Ca2+ signals were the same in control cells and cells expressing the different aralar1 and citrin variants, thus ruling out an indirect effect through the Ca(2+)-sensitive dehydrogenases. Together, these data show that the decoding of Ca2+ signals in mitochondria depends on the coordinate activity of mitochondrial enzymes and carriers, which may thus represent useful pharmacological targets in this process of major pathophysiological interest."

In the present study, it was used to define a set of alterations caused by diabetes in heart mitochondria from streptozotocin-treated rats. We demonstrated that the expression of proteins from the myocardial tricarboxylic acid cycle was not altered in diabetes. However, up-regulation of the fatty acid β-oxidation favored fatty acids over glucose as a source of acetyl CoA for the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Protein levels for several proteins involved in electron transport were modestly decreased. Whether this may depress overall ATP production remains to be established, since the protein level of ATP synthase seems to be unchanged. Other changes include down-regulation of protein levels for creatine kinase, voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC-1), HSP60, and Grp75. The mitochondria-associated level of albumin was decreased, while the level of catalase was substantially increased. All of the changes were evident as early as 1 week after streptozotocin administration.

The studies on diabetic mitochondria generally suggest that diabetes causes dysfunctional mitochondria (11Pierce G.N. Dhalla N.S. Can. J. Cardiol. 1985; 1: 48-54PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tanaka Y.

However, little is known about the nature or extent of mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetes and the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and diabetic pathology has yet to be defined. The cardiac function is dependent on a constant rate of resynthesis of ATP by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). 1The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight; STZ, streptozotocin; IDDM, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; VDAC-1, voltage-dependent anion channel 1.1The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight; STZ, streptozotocin; IDDM, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; VDAC-1, voltage-dependent anion channel 1. Fatty acids and glucose are normally major energy substrates in heart. Both pathways, glucose oxidation and fatty acid oxidation, merge in the mitochondria on the level of acetyl CoA production. Acetyl-CoA then enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The last step in ATP production is the entry of NADH and FADH2, derived from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, into the electron transport chain coupled with the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) causes alterations in myocardial metabolism characterized by a decrease in glucose uptake and utilization and an increase in fatty acid oxidation (15Stanley W.C. Lopaschuk G.D. McCormack J.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 34: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 16Depre C. Young M.E. Ying J. Ahuja H.S. Han Q. Garza N. Davies P.J.A. Taegtmeyer H. J. Mol.

Circulation. 2002; 105: 1861-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). As a first step toward profiling the changes in diabetic mitochondria, we have analyzed the pattern of protein expression in heart mitochondria from streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats. Our primary focus was on proteins involved in three major mitochondrial cycles associated with ATP production, namely on β-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and OXPHOS. The diabetes-associated changes in expression levels of several other mitochondrial proteins were also estimated. Animals and Treatment—Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (median body weight 250 g) were from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN. Animals were maintained on standard rat chow and tap water ad libitum. STZ (Sigma) was dissolved in sterile 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 4.5) and injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight. Control rats received the corresponding volume of citrate buffer. The blood glucose levels were monitored using Accu-Chek Advantage blood glucose monitor and test strips (Roche Applied Science). The STZ-treated rats that showed fasting blood glucose levels above 350 mg/dl, in addition to loss of weight and polyuria, were considered as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Diabetic rats and age-matched control rats were sacrificed at 1 or 4 weeks after STZ injection. Isolation of Heart Mitochondria—Mitochondria from individual rat hearts were isolated using differential centrifugation (18Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) in 5 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 0.25 m mannitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin supplemented with protease and proteasome inhibitors: 1mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 50 μm bestatin, 15 μm E-64, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 20 μm proteasome inhibitor I, 20 μm lactacystin, and 20 μm MG-132. Purified mitochondria were further isolated using 30% Percoll, essentially as described in Ref. 18Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar. Percoll-purified mitochondria were then sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The high speed supernatant fraction includes mitochondrial soluble proteins. The high speed pellet includes mainly mitochondrial membrane proteins. Total protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Labeling of Mitochondrial Proteins—The high speed supernatant and pellet fractions from Percoll-purified heart mitochondria from diabetic (1 week and 4 week of diabetes), and age-matched control rats were alkylated with acrylamide. 1 mg of total protein was dissolved in 1 ml of 2 m thiourea, 7 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The mitochondrial fractions from normal rats were then alkylated with 400 mm light (non-deuterated) acrylamide, while the mitochondrial fractions from diabetic rats were alkylated with 400 mm heavy (deuterated) acrylamide (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Woburn, MA) for 5 h at room temperature. The corresponding normal and diabetic fractions were then mixed in the 1:1 ratio. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (Two-dimensional PAGE)— The first dimension was performed using the PROTEAN IEF cell (Bio-Rad). The 7-cm pH 3–10 immobilized pH gradient strips were rehydrated with 125 μl of a solution (2 m thiourea, 7 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Biolytes 3–10, 1% dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue) that contained 200 μg of the total protein. Isoelectric focusing was conducted at 250 V for 15 min, linearly increased over 2 h to a maximum of 4,000 V, and then run to accumulate a total of 20,000 V/h. For the second dimension, the immobilized pH gradient strips were equilibrated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and bromphenol blue. The strips were then embedded in 0.7% (w/v) agarose on the top of 10% acrylamide slab gels containing a 4% stacking gel. Identification and Quantification of Mitochondrial Proteins—The proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight MS analysis (MALDI-TOF) of in-gel tryptic digest of selected Coomassie-stained spots. MALDI-TOF was performed using a Voyager-DE STR BioSpectrometry work station (PerSeptive Biosystems) operated in the delayed extraction and reflector mode with a matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid. Bradykinin fragment 1–7 (MH+ 757.3997), angiotensin II (MH+ 1046.5423), synthetic peptide P14R (MH+ 1533.8582), and ACTH fragment 18–39 (MH+ 2465.1989) were used for external calibration. All spectra were also calibrated internally on the trypsin peaks at 842.51 and 2211.0968. Peptide mass fingerprinting data were evaluated using the MASCOT software (www.matrixscience.com). For quantifying the relative abundance of a protein, the peak height of the monoisotopic peak of the heavy (deuterated) acrylamide-labeled peptide was divided by the peak height of the monoisotopic peak of the light (non-deuterated) acrylamide-labeled form of the peptide. Six MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired for each individual sample, and the results were averaged. All measurements were performed for n = 6 animals, which were handled individually. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Principle of the Method— Fig. 1 shows a schematic presentation of the method of quantitative proteomics used in this report. It is based on the use of light (non-deuterated or d 0) and heavy (deuterated or d 3) acrylamide to alkylate cysteine residues in proteins before their separation by two-dimensional PAGE and subsequent analysis by MALDI-TOF MS. To estimate the relative amount of a specific protein in two separate samples, one sample is labeled with the light acrylamide and another sample is labeled with heavy acrylamide. Heavy acrylamide has 3 deuteriums instead of 3 protons and is 3 mass units heavier than light acrylamide. From the chemical point of view, there is no difference between light and heavy forms of acrylamide. This warrants equal efficiency of alkylation in separate samples and, after mixing, the co-migration of the same proteins from separate samples on two-dimensional PAGE (1Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar, 7Smolka M. Zhou H. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 19-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The areas of interest were then in-gel digested with trypsin and identified using MALDI-TOF MS. The following quantitative profiling was accomplished by comparing a ratio between the intensities of the light and heavy mass components of the cysteine-containing peptide(s). An example in the Fig. 1 shows that the cysteine-containing peptide, YCTQDAFFQV, from dienoyl-CoA isomerase is represented by two isotopic envelopes that are separated by 3 mass units. The first envelope represents dienoyl-CoA isomerase from normal mitochondria. The second envelope represents dienoyl-CoA isomerase from 4-week diabetic mitochondria. Since mitochondrial samples were mixed 1:1, we concluded that the level of dienoyl-CoA isomerase was increased 2.5 times in the diabetic sample. Quantification of Changes in Protein Levels in Heart Mitochondria Caused by Diabetes—To improve a resolution of two-dimensional PAGE, the mitochondria were first separated in two fractions: (i) the high speed supernatant fraction which includes mitochondrial soluble proteins and (ii) the high-speed pellet, which includes mainly mitochondrial membrane proteins. These two fractions were then analyzed separately. The representative Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gel patterns are shown in the Fig. 2. Our primary focus was on proteins that belong to β-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, or to OXPHOS. We have identified many proteins involved in these three major mitochondrial pathways. However, it should be noted that the quantitative method used in this study has some apparent limitations. It is not applicable to proteins without cysteine residues. The other problem is if the peptide overlaps with another ion, then quantification would be impossible. For these reasons we failed to quantify some of the identified proteins. Only those proteins for which a reliable quantification was achieved are numbered in the Fig. 2. The identification of these proteins is summarized in the Table I. For all of these identifications, the MOWSE score from Mascot software (ca.expasy.org/sitemap.html) search was higher than the score at which statistical significance (p < 0.05) occurred for that particular search. Identified proteins also corresponded well to the expected molecular mass and pI values.Table IIdentification of proteins in Coomassie-stained gel spots numbered in Fig. 2.Spot and proteinMassPeptide matchesCoverageScorekDa%β-Oxidation1.

It is not applicable to proteins that do not have cysteine residues. The other limitation to be mentioned is if a peptide overlaps with another ion, then quantification would be impossible. For these reasons we were not able to quantify some proteins of interest, such as the β-subunit of ATP synthase (no cysteine residues) or several proteins involved in electron transport chain (3 mass unit shift was not enough to resolve big cysteine-containing peptides). Nevertheless, we found this method to be useful and reliable for quantification of many other selected proteins and applied it to profiling of heart mitochondrial proteins during the development of IDDM in rats. Our primary focus was on mitochondrial pathways involved in ATP production, namely on β-oxidation of fatty acids, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and OXPHOS. Changes in protein levels for these three pathways are discussed in detail below. β-Oxidation—The main source of energy for heart muscle is fatty acid oxidation, with the balance coming from the oxidation of pyruvate derived from glycolysis and lactate uptake. Diabetes increases level of circulating fatty acids and decreases glucose uptake and utilization. Our direct measurements show that various mitochondrial proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation are up-regulated in IDDM. The levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (regenerates long chain acyl-CoA in the mitochondrial matrix), three different acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (the rate-limiting enzymes that catalyze the first dehydrogenation of fatty acids), dienoyl-CoA isomerase (catalyzes hydration followed the first dehydrogenation), and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (catalyzes the second dehydrogenation) were gradually increased (Table II). The expression of electron transfer flavoprotein, a necessary electron acceptor for many mitochondrial dehydrogenases, was also increased. Our proteomic findings for heart muscle from rat model of IDDM concur well with a published study that is based on quantitative measurement of mRNA levels in skeletal muscle from a mouse model of IDDM (19Yechoor V.K. Patti M.-E. Saccone R. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10587-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Yechoor et al. (19Yechoor V.K. Patti M.-E. Saccone R. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10587-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the mRNA levels for many proteins involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids were 1.2–1.9 times increased in the skeletal muscle from STZ-treated mice. Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle—β-Oxidation produces acetyl-CoA for the tricarboxylic acid cycle. It appears that in contrast to β-oxidation, the levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle proteins were not altered in heart from diabetic rats (Table II). At least for seven proteins quantified, we did not observe a difference between diabetic and normal groups at both time points, 1 and 4 weeks, of IDDM development. Our direct proteomic measurements support earlier biochemical measurements of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme activities in myocardium of diabetic rats (20Chen V. Ianuzzo C.D. Fong B.C. Spitzer J.J. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). OXPHOS—OXPHOS consists of five large enzyme complexes (Complexes I–V) that couple oxidation to phosphorylation in the inner mitochondrial membrane and provide most of the ATP produced. Biochemical studies suggest that this process may be impaired in the diabetic heart (11Pierce G.N. Dhalla N.S. Can. J. Cardiol. 1985; 1: 48-54PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tanaka Y. Konno N. Kako K.J.

J. 1996; 60: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our study shows that the protein level for four subunits of Complex I was decreased ∼20–25%. A 46% decrease was found for cytochrome c-1 from Complex III. These changes are relatively modest, but statistically reproducible for a group of proteins involved in OXPHOS, consistent with published biochemical studies (11Pierce G.N. Dhalla N.S. Can. J. Cardiol. 1985; 1: 48-54PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tanaka Y. Konno N. Kako K.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1992; 26: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Mokhtar N. Lavoie J.P.

J. 1996; 60: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and seem to be a part of the overall program of adaptation in diabetic heart. A study based on mRNA measurements (19Yechoor V.K. Patti M.-E. Saccone R. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10587-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) provides an additional support to our proteomic observations. Yechoor et al. (19Yechoor V.K. Patti M.-E. Saccone R. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10587-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) demonstrated that several subunits from Complexes I–IV were 20–30% down-regulated in the skeletal muscle from STZ-treated mice. We also quantified the protein level for two subunits from ATP synthase (Complex V) and found them unchanged. Taken together our direct measurements of protein levels in diabetic heart mitochondria show that adaptation of heart metabolism to IDDM includes up-regulation of fatty acid β-oxidation. This changed only the source of acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle. At the same time, it seems that the efficiency of the TCA cycle to pump NADH and FADH2 into the electron transport chain remains unchanged. It is expected that some down-regulations on the level of Complex I and Complex III would be accompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species. Whether this affects the overall production of ATP is not clear, since Complex V was presumably unchanged. In brief, the primary difference in mitochondrial metabolism of diabetic heart appears to be an increased consumption of fatty acids. Whether production of ATP was compromised remains to be established. We also want to underline that our discussion is based on the direct measurements of protein levels in diabetic mitochondria rather than protein activities, and we cannot rule out the additional potentially negative effects of oxidative stress, which may cause modification of protein activities involved in ATP synthesis. Others—Several proteins involved in other mitochondrial pathways were also quantified. Creatine kinase level was obviously decreased that would decrease the level of available creatine phosphate, an important energy source for heart muscle at high workloads. Similar 50% decrease of muscle creatine kinase from STZ-treated rats was reported based on mRNA measurements (16Depre C. Young M.E. Ying J. Ahuja H.S. Han Q. Garza N. Davies P.J.A. Taegtmeyer H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 985-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The protein levels of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (mitochondrial amino acid synthesis) and annexin II (maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis) were unchanged. Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 was the only one example in the present study when the protein level dropped 1 week after STZ administration and then recovered later. Whether it is relevant to heart adaptation in diabetes warrant further studies. Two mitochondrial chaperones, HSP60 and Grp75, were moderately decreased. Cardioprotective function of molecular chaperons is well established (21Snoeckx L.H. Cornelussen R.N. Van Nieuwenhoven F.A. Reneman R.S. Van der Vusse G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1461-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). If diabetes causes a decline in mitochondrial chaperone levels, it may adversely affect mitochondrial refolding and contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction seen with diabetes. The protein level of albumin was 42% decreased in diabetic mitochondria. For catalase it was an apparent time course of changes, 2.6-fold increase after 1 week and 6.2-fold increase after 4 weeks of diabetes. Albumin and catalase fall into a category of nonmitochondrial proteins, which are always found in mitochondria. The association of nonmitochondrial proteins with mitochondria may or may not be biologically relevant (22Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Zhang B. Glenn G.M. Warnock D.E. Wiley S. Murphy A.N. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). However, control and diabetic mitochondria were purified in our experiments side-by-side, and since the protein levels for albumin and catalase were changed during the diabetes development, it is not possible to interpret their presence in mitochondria as just contaminants. In terms of function, both proteins may be involved in antioxidant defense and their association with diabetic mitochondria could be relevant to the increased oxidative stress in diabetes. In summary, for the first time a quantitative proteomic approach was used in assessing the diabetes-associated changes in heart mitochondria. In addition to the previous biochemical and mRNA studies, we found several lines of proteomic evidence that mitochondrial function in diabetes may be modified as a result of simultaneously altered expression of multiple genes."
https://openalex.org/W1968853769,"Autophosphorylation of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) involved in exopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis and transport has been observed in a number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. However, besides their own phosphorylation, little is known about other substrates targeted by these protein-modifying enzymes. Here, we present evidence that the protein-tyrosine kinase Wzc of Escherichia coli is able to phosphorylate an endogenous enzyme, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Ugd), which participates in the synthesis of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid. The process of phosphorylation of Ugd by Wzc was shown to be stimulated by previous autophosphorylation of Wzc on tyrosine 569. The phosphorylation of Ugd was demonstrated to actually occur on tyrosine and result in a significant increase of its dehydrogenase activity. In addition, the phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase Wzb, which is known to effectively dephosphorylate Wzc, exhibited only a low effect, if any, on the dephosphorylation of Ugd. These data were related to the recent observation that two other UDP-glucose dehydrogenases have been also shown to be phosphorylated by a PTK in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Comparative analysis of the activities of PTKs from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria showed that they are regulated by different mechanisms that involve, respectively, either the autophosphorylation of kinases or their interaction with a membrane protein activator. Autophosphorylation of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) involved in exopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis and transport has been observed in a number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in all living organisms and plays a central role in eukaryotes by regulating a wide variety of cellular processes (1Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J.

The first autophosphorylating bacterial protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PTP, phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase; Cps, capsular polysaccharide; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Ugd, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PTP, phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase; Cps, capsular polysaccharide; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Ugd, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase. were detected in Acinetobacter (4Dadssi M.

Gene. 1997; 204: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since then, autophosphorylating enzymes exhibiting significant similarity to these PTKs have been detected in a large number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and the recent progress in genome sequencing has revealed that this type of protein-modifying enzyme is, in fact, present in most bacteria (6Vincent C.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In addition, bacteria most often contain simultaneously phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases (PTPs), which antagonize the activity of PTKs (13Potts M. Sun H. Mockaitis K. Kennelly P.J. Reed D. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7632-7635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bliska J.B. Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genestier A.L. Etienne J. Cozzone A.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5194-5199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The genes encoding PTPs are usually located immediately upstream of the genes encoding PTKs (17Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Vincent C. Vaganay E. Riberty M. Duclos B. Cozzone A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Morona J.K. Morona R. Miller D.C. Paton J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, the genes encoding both PTKs and PTPs are generally organized together with genes coding for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis or transport of capsular polysaccharides (cps) or exopolysaccharides (5Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Vaganay E. Vincent C. Deleage G. Duclos B. Cozzone A.J. Gene. 1997; 204: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Vincent C. Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Such colocalization of the cps genes and the genes encoding the protein-tyrosine phosphorylating and dephosphorylating enzymes has suggested that reversible protein-tyrosine phosphorylation might regulate the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides. Actually, PTKs and PTPs have been shown to play an important role in the production and/or processing of capsular polysaccharides and exopolysaccharides (19Stevenson G. Andrianopoulos K. Hobbs M. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 20Nakar D. Gutnick D.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For example, in Escherichia coli the kinase Wzc and the phosphatase Wzb have been reported to participate in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid (21Vincent C. Duclos B. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Riberty M. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, when Wzc is phosphorylated, no colanic acid is synthesized by bacteria, whereas when Wzc is dephosphorylated by Wzb, colanic acid is produced. The same observation has been made in Streptococcus pneumoniae where autophosphorylation of the kinase CpsD decreases its activity and, consequently, lowers the production of capsular polysaccharides (12Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Although PTKs from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria exhibit significant sequence similarity, they possess different domain organizations (Fig. 1). PTKs of Gram-negative bacteria are usually large proteins (∼80 kDa) composed of an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal cytosolic PTK domain (22Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Obadia B. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37339-37348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) containing the active site Walker motifs A and B (23Doublet P. Vincent C. Grangeasse C. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When expressed separately, the soluble C-terminal domain of E. coli Wzc still exhibits autophosphorylating activity (24Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7127-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By contrast, PTKs of Gram-positive bacteria are naturally separated into two distinct proteins, i.e. a transmembrane protein with limited similarity to the N-terminal domain and a soluble protein with significant similarity to the C-terminal domain of PTKs from Gram-negative bacteria. The soluble protein autophosphorylates at a tyrosine cluster located in its C terminus and also contains the Walker motifs A and B (11Bender M.H. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47966-47974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Morona J.K. Morona R. Miller D.C. Paton J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Mijakovic, I., Poncet, S., Boël, G., Mazé, S., Gillet, A., Decottignies, P., Grangeasse, C., Doublet, P., Le Maréchal, P., and Deutscher, J. (2003) EMBO J., in pressGoogle Scholar). The different domain organizations in PTKs from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria have suggested that these enzymes might be regulated differently. Indeed, although intermolecular autophosphorylation of Wzc at the C-terminal tyrosine cluster (five tyrosines from position 708 to position 715) is stimulated by intramolecular autophosphorylation at Tyr569 (24Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7127-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), autophosphorylation of the S. pneumoniae kinase CpsD only occurs on the tyrosine cluster when the membrane protein modulator CpsC is also present (Fig. 1) (11Bender M.H. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47966-47974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Several studies have been performed to assess the biological role of phosphorylation of the tyrosine cluster located at the C-terminal end of PTKs. Thus, in E. coli K30 it has been shown that the overall level of phosphorylation in this region, rather than the phosphorylation of any specific residue(s), is important for the activity of Wzc in the capsule assembly (27Paiment A. Hocking J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the Gram-positive bacterium S. pneumoniae, the phosphorylation of only one of the different tyrosine residues in the tyrosine cluster has appeared to be sufficient to inactivate the CpsD kinase (25Morona J.K. Morona R. Miller D.C. Paton J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In any case, whatever the mechanism used, it seems that phosphorylation is required to modulate PTKs activity in the metabolism of capsular polysaccharides.UDP-glucose dehydrogenase is one of the enzymes catalyzing the formation of precursors for the synthesis of polysaccharides (19Stevenson G. Andrianopoulos K. Hobbs M. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In E. coli K12, the synthesis of colanic acid decreases when wzc or wzb is inactivated. From this observation, it seemed of interest to investigate whether the E. coli UDP-glucose dehydrogenase Ugd could be subject to protein-tyrosine phosphorylation.In this work, we examined whether Ugd was modified by the PTK Wzc and if such a modification was able to modulate its UDP-glucose dehydrogenase activity. In addition, we analyzed the Wzb-catalyzed dephosphorylation of both Wzc and Ugd. Finally, in search of the mode of functioning of PTKs, we analyzed comparatively the phosphorylation mechanism of these enzymes in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Genomic DNA prepared from E. coli strain XL1-B K12 (28Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 371-377Google Scholar) was used as template for the PCR amplification of the ugd gene. This strain also served for the propagation of plasmids in cloning experiments and the overproduction of proteins. All strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) or 2TY medium (16 g of Bacto-tryptone, 5 g of NaCl, and 10 g of Bacto-yeast extract per liter of water). When appropriate, media were supplemented with the antibiotics ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and tetracycline (15 μg/ml) at the concentrations given in parentheses.

Transformation of E. coli cells was performed by following the method of Dagert and Ehrlich (29Dagert M. Ehrlich S.D. Gene. 1979; 6: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was carried out by Genome-Express Corp. to ensure error-free amplification. BLAST searches (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

The amplified DNA fragment (1164 bp) was restricted with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into pQE30 vector, which was opened with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was termed pQE30-U (Table I).Overproduction and Purification of His6-tagged Proteins—Cells of E. coli strain XL1-B were transformed with pQE30-derived vectors expressing Ugd or the cytoplasmic PTK domain of Wzc (with or without the C-terminal tyrosine cluster) (Table I). 100 ml of 2TY medium containing ampicillin and tetracycline was inoculated with an overnight cell culture and incubated at 37 °C under shaking until it reached an A 600 of 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was subsequently added at a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and growth was continued for 3 h at 37 °C under shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and centrifuged again. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A containing 5 μg/ml DNase I and RNase A. Cells were disrupted in a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i. The resulting cell extract was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was added to Ni2+-NTA-agarose suspension, and batch binding was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 4 °C under gentle shaking. The cell lysate/Ni2+-NTA-agarose mixture was filled in a column that was washed with buffer A and subsequently with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole until the absorption at A 280 remained stable. Elution of His6-tagged proteins was carried out with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Aliquots of the collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing purified His6-tagged Ugd were pooled, applied to a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) and stored at –20 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The purification procedures for His6-tagged mutant PTK domains of Wzc, His6-Wzb, His6-YwqD, GST-YwqC and GST-YwqC-NCter have been described elsewhere (6Vincent C. Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol.

(2003) EMBO J., in pressGoogle Scholar).Phosphorylation Assay—An in vitro phosphorylation assay was carried out by incubating the reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing ∼2 μg of the various purified wild-type or mutant proteins and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4 μCi) for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by either adding an equal volume of 2× sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 100 °C or by precipitating the P-proteins with 5 volumes of acetone. One-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar), whereas two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by O'Farrell (33O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were soaked in 16% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min at 90 °C. They were stained with Coomassie Blue, and radioactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography using x-ray films (Kodak BIOMAX-MR).Protein Dephosphorylation Assay—Purified wild-type or mutant His6-tagged proteins were phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described above and subsequently dialyzed overnight against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The dephosphorylation reaction was carried out by adding 1 μg of purified Wzb to the P-proteins and diluting the assay mixtures 2-fold with a buffer containing 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C and, at various time intervals (from 1 to 30 min) aliquots were withdrawn and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.Phosphotransferase Assay—The purified PTK domain of Wzc (His6-Wzc-(Ser447–Ala704)) was autophosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP before it was repurified on a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column as described above. The capacity of the 32P-labeled cytoplasmic His6-Wzc domain to transfer its phosphoryl group bound to Tyr569 to Ugd was tested by incubating the two proteins in phosphorylation buffer in the absence or presence of 50 μm non-radioactive ATP.UDP-Glucose Dehydrogenase Assay—Ugd purified from E. coli was tested for UDP-glucose dehydrogenase activity by using a spectrophotometric assay described by Pagni et al. (34Pagni M. Lazarevic V. Soldo B. Karamata D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 340 nm was measured for 10 min at 37 °C by using a thermostated spectrophotometer. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase activity was also determined after phosphorylating or dephosphorylating purified Ugd. For this purpose, 2 μg of Ugd was either phosphorylated with Wzc as described above or dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase by incubating Ugd solutions (20 μl) for 10 min at 37 °C before 230 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and 2 mm DTT and 300 μl of the same buffer also containing 10 mm NAD+ and 10 mm UDP-glucose (UDPG) were added.Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—The method used to detect acid-stable phosphoamino acids was described in detail in (35Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ugd was phosphorylated by Wzc in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Proteins were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. The radioactive band corresponding to 32P-labeled Ugd was excised, and the protein was hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The acid-stable phosphoamino acids thus liberated were lyophilized and dissolved in water containing Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P) standards. This mixture was separated by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 (800 V × h) in a buffer containing 7.8% acetic acid and 2.5% formic acid (first dimension) followed by ascending chromatography in 2-methyl-1-propanol/formic acid/water (8:3:4) (v/v/v) (second dimension). After migration, the plates were dried and stained with ninhydrin, and radioactive molecules were detected by autoradiography.RESULTSTyrosine Phosphorylation of Ugd Is Catalyzed by the Cytoplasmic PTK Domain of Wzc—Two recent reports suggested that E. coli Ugd might be subject to phosphorylation at tyrosine. (i) The two UDP-glucose dehydrogenases of another bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, were found to be phosphorylated by the endogenous kinase YwqD (26Mijakovic, I., Poncet, S., Boël, G., Mazé, S., Gillet, A., Decottignies, P., Grangeasse, C., Doublet, P., Le Maréchal, P., and Deutscher, J. (2003) EMBO J., in pressGoogle Scholar); and (ii) colanic acid synthesis in E. coli was decreased when disrupting the PTK- and PTP-encoding genes wzc and wzb, respectively (21Vincent C. Duclos B. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Riberty M. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because the E. coli UDP-glucose dehydrogenase Ugd not only exhibits ∼30% sequence identity with the B. subtilis enzymes but also catalyzes the formation of UDP-glucuronic acid, a precursor of colanic acid synthesis (19Stevenson G. Andrianopoulos K. Hobbs M. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), one could expect that Ugd might be phosphorylated by Wzc.To check this hypothesis, phosphorylation experiments were carried out with His6-Ugd and His6-Wzc-(Ser447–Ala704), the catalytic PTK domain of Wzc missing the C-terminal tyrosine cluster. When these two purified proteins were incubated together with [γ-32P]ATP, phosphorylation of Ugd was indeed detected after SDS/PAGE. Although no radioactive protein was observed when His6-Ugd was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown), two labeled bands appeared when His6-Wzc-(Ser447–Ala704) was also present in the incubation mixture (Fig. 2A). The faster migrating radioactive band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼31 kDa corresponded to His6-Wzc-(Ser447–Ala704) autophosphorylated at Tyr569, whereas the slower radioactive band (∼44 kDa) migrated to the same position as His6-Ugd. Phosphorylation of Ugd appeared to be dependent on a functional Walker motif A of Wzc. Indeed, when Lys540 in the Wzc Walker A motif (Fig. 1) was replaced with methionine, not only autophosphorylation of Wzc but also phosphorylation of Ugd was abolished (data not shown).Fig. 2Phosphorylation of Ugd protein. His6-Ugd was overproduced, purified on Ni2+-immobilized matrix, and assayed for in vitro phosphorylation in the presence of the Wzc cytoplasmic fragment His6-Wzc-(Ser447–Ala704) and [γ-32P]ATP. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (A) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (B), and radioactive bands were revealed by autoradiography. Phosphorylated proteins are indicated by arrows. Coomassie Blue staining of unphosphorylated Ugd is shown as a dashed circle on the two-dimensional electrophoresis autoradiogram. The phosphoamino acid content of Ugd (C) was analyzed, after acid hydrolysis by electrophoresis in the first dimension (1D) and ascending chromatography in the second dimension (2D). After migration, radioactive molecules were revealed by autoradiography. Authentic phosphoserine (P-Ser), phosphothreonine (P-Thr), and phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr) were run in parallel and visualized by staining with ninhydrin. Radioactive spots on both the left and right sides of the diagram correspond to unhydrolyzed phosphopeptides and inorganic phosphate, respectively (53Cortay J.C. Negre D. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 214-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ugd seemed to be monophosphorylated, because a single radioactive spot was detected after His6-Wzc-(Ser447–Ala704)-catalyzed phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP and subsequent two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2B). As expected, radiolabeled [32P]Ugd exhibited a slightly lower pI than unmodified Ugd (dotted circle in Fig. 2B). No radioactive spot corresponding to autophosphorylated His6-Wzc-(Ser447–Ala704) was detected on the two-dimensional gel. His6-Wzc-(Ser447–Ala704), which has a theoretical pI of 9.25, probably ran out of the gel. To determine whether phosphorylation of Ugd by Wzc, similarly to autophosphorylation of Wzc, would also occur at a tyrosine residue, total acid hydrolysis of 32P-labeled Ugd previously separated on SDS/polyacrylamide gel was carried out. Two-dimensional electrophoresis/chromatography of the corresponding radioactive hydrolysis products revealed that only radioactive phosphotyrosine was present, whereas no phosphoserine or phosphothreonine could be detected (Fig. 2C).Autophosphorylation of Wzc at Tyr569 Stimulates Ugd Phosphorylation—As already mentioned, intramolecular autophosphorylation at Tyr569 is known to stimulate t"

The dominating cat allergen, Fel d 1, is composed of two heterodimers. Recently, it has been shown that recombinant Fel d 1, consisting of chain 2 and chain 1 fused together without additional linker, has immunological properties indistinguishable from the natural heterodimeric protein. Herein, we report the crystal structure of recombinant monomeric Fel d 1 at 1.85-Å resolution, determined by multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction using selenomethionine substituted protein. Fel d 1 is an all-helical protein and consists of eight helices. The two halves of the recombinant Fel d 1 molecule, corresponding to the wild-type Fel d 1 chains, are very similar in three-dimensional structure, despite the lack of significant sequence identity. The structure of the Fel d 1 presents a striking similarity to that of uteroglobin, a steroid-inducible cytokine-like molecule with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. An internal, asymmetric cavity is formed in the Fel d 1 that could bind an endogenous ligand. The distribution of residues lining this cavity suggests that such a ligand must be amphipathic. The structure of Fel d 1 displays the localization of three previously defined Fel d 1 IgE epitopes on the surface of the protein.

The three-dimensional structure provides a framework for rational design of hypoallergenic mutants aimed for treatment of cat allergy. Proteins from domestic cats (Felis domesticus) are some of the most potent elicitors of allergic disease, affecting people worldwide (1Platts-Mills T.A. Vervloet D. Thomas W.R. Aalberse R.C. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1997; 100: S2-S24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The severity of symptoms ranges from mild rhinitis and conjunctivitis to life-threatening asthmatic responses. The most prominent and potent allergen in cat dander, termed Fel d 1, was identified 3 decades ago (2Ohman J.L. Lowell F.C. Bloch K.J. J. Immunol. 1974; 113: 1668-1677PubMed Google Scholar). Fel d 1 elicits IgE responses in 90–95% of patients with cat allergy (3van Ree R. van Leeuwen W.A. Bulder I. Bond J. Aalberse R.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 104: 1223-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and accounts for 60–90% of the total allergenic activity in cat dander (4Kleine-Tebbe J. Kleine-Tebbe A. Jeep S. Schou C. Lowenstein H. Kunkel G. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1993; 100: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The allergen is produced by sebaceous glands and squamous epithelial cells and is transferred to the pelt by licking and grooming (5Bartholome K. Kissler W. Baer H. Kopietz-Schulte E. Wahn U. J.

Immunol. 1990; 92: 375-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The allergen, which is carried by small airborne particles, is abundant in society, including environments in which cats are not present, such as schools and public transportation (10Partti-Pellinen K. Marttila O. Makinen-Kiljunen S. Haahtela T. Allergy. 2000; 55: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Almqvist C. Wickman M. Perfetti L. Berglind N. Renstrom A. Hedren M. Larsson K. Hedlin G. Malmberg P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have evaluated the clinical importance and biochemical properties of this ubiquitous protein, and clinical vaccination trials have been conducted, using T cell peptides derived from Fel d 1 (12Norman P.S. Ohman Jr., J.L. Long A.A. Creticos P.S. Gefter M.A. Shaked Z. Wood R.A. Eggleston P.A. Hafner K.B. Rao P. Lichtenstein L.M. Jones N.H. Nicodemus C.F. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Lancet. 2002; 360: 47-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, the structural basis for the powerful allergenicity of Fel d 1 has remained enigmatic. The allergen Fel d 1 belongs to the secretoglobin family of proteins (14Klug J. Beier H.M. Bernard A. Chilton B.S. Fleming T.P. Lehrer R.I. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Singh G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 923: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is a 35-kDa tetrameric glycoprotein (15Duffort O.A. Carreira J. Nitti G. Polo F. Lombardero M. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Kristensen A.K. Schou C. Roepstorff P. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 899-908PubMed Google Scholar) formed by two heterodimers (15Duffort O.A. Carreira J. Nitti G. Polo F. Lombardero M. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Each dimer is composed of two chains derived from two independent genes (17Griffith I.J. Craig S. Pollock J. Yu X.B. Morgenstern J.P. Rogers B.L. Gene. 1992; 113: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), chain 1, comprising 70 residues, and chain 2, comprising 90 or 92 residues. The two isoforms of the second chain are expressed in the skin and the saliva (17Griffith I.J. Craig S. Pollock J. Yu X.B. Morgenstern J.P. Rogers B.L. Gene. 1992; 113: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), respectively. Three interchain disulfide bonds linking the two peptide chains have been proposed (16Kristensen A.K. Schou C. Roepstorff P. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 899-908PubMed Google Scholar); the distribution of the disulfide bridges (i.e. Cys-3 (chain 1)-Cys-73 (chain 2), Cys-44 (chain 1)-Cys-48 (chain 2), and Cys-70 (chain 1)-Cys-7 (chain 2)) suggests an antiparallel orientation of the two chains in each subunit. In routine allergy praxis, only crude cat allergen extracts have so far been used for diagnosis and treatment of cat allergy. One of the drawbacks with these extracts is that the amount of Fel d 1 may vary markedly. Because the purification and production of native Fel d 1 is a time-consuming and costly process, Fel d 1 obtained by DNA technology may offer means of overcoming these problems. Several attempts have been made to refold the separate peptide chains into a native-like allergen, with only partial success (18Slunt J.B. Rogers B.L. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 1221-1228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Keating K.M. Segal D.B. Craig S.J. Nault A.K. Semensi V. Wasserman A.S. Counsell C.M. Bond J.F. Mol.

Immunol. 1993; 30: 1529-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although a mix of the separate chains has proven to be valuable for in vitro allergy diagnostics (3van Ree R. van Leeuwen W.A. Bulder I. Bond J. Aalberse R.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 104: 1223-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Slunt J.B. Rogers B.L. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 1221-1228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a soluble and correctly folded recombinant molecule would be useful not only for diagnosis and treatment but also for molecular studies of the Fel d 1 protein. Using a direct fusion of the two chains of Fel d 1 (Fig. 1a), we have been able to establish in vitro conditions for the appropriate refolding of the fused protein. Therefore and hereafter, recombinant Fel d 1 will be denoted as monomer rather than heterodimer, as would be appropriate for native Fel d 1. Refolded recombinant Fel d 1 displays an identical disulfide-bonding pattern and a comparable secondary structure to the native protein as revealed by circular dichroism (21Grönlund H. Bergman T. Sandström K. Alvelius G. Reininger R. Verdino P. Hauswirth A. Liderot K. Valent P. Spitzauer S. Keller W. Valenta R. van Hage-Hamsten M. J. Biol. Chem. May 5, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M301416200)Google Scholar). It forms a dimer of the two fused chains corresponding to the native tetramer. Most importantly, the in vitro immunoreactivity of the stable recombinant Fel d 1 is indistinguishable from the native allergen (21Grönlund H. Bergman T. Sandström K. Alvelius G. Reininger R. Verdino P. Hauswirth A. Liderot K. Valent P. Spitzauer S. Keller W. Valenta R. van Hage-Hamsten M. J. Biol. Chem. May 5, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M301416200)Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of only a limited number of important animal-, plant-, and dust mite-derived allergens have been revealed (22Valenta R. Kraft D. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 179: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The biological functions of these allergens are diverse or unknown, without any particular biological or structural feature that seems to predispose a protein to act as an allergen (23Aalberse R.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 106: 228-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). To increase the understanding of the mechanisms for cat allergy and to obtain knowledge regarding new strategies for treatment, we have solved the crystal structure of the most potent cat allergen, Fel d 1. The fold of the latter presents a striking resemblance to that of uteroglobin, a steroid-inducible, cytokine-like molecule with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This similarity in three-dimensional structure suggests a potential mechanism underlying the potent allergenicity of Fel d 1. The structure also reveals the presence of an internal pocket. The shape of the cavity, as well as the properties of the residues that line it indicates a different kind of ligand to Fel d 1 than those proposed for uteroglobin. Furthermore, the structure of Fel d 1 allows for rational design of hypoallergenic IgE binding epitopes aimed for treatment of cat allergic patients. Production and Crystallization of Fel d 1—Recombinant Fel d 1 was produced with chain 2 directly linked to chain 1 followed by a His6 tag as in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS and isolated from inclusion bodies. The protein was further purified to homogeneity using a Ni2+ chelate column, size exclusion, and ion exchange chromatography (24Kaiser L. Grönlund H. Sandalova T. Ljunggren H.G. Schneider G. Van Hage-Hamsten M. Achour A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1103-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After concentration to ∼7.5 mg/ml, the protein was stored at –80 °C. The SeMet-substituted Fel d 1 was produced in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (25Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) and purified in the same way as the wild-type protein. Fel d 1 crystals were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Typically, 2 μl of protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the crystallization reservoir solution, and allowed to equilibrate at 4 °C. The best Fel d 1 crystals appeared after seeding in 13% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) 1The abbreviations used are: MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8, using a protein concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. The SeMet-Fel d 1 crystals were produced by seeding from wild-type crystals in 16% MPD and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8, using a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. Data Collection and Processing—The crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant solution (20% MPD) before flash-freezing in a cold nitrogen stream. A data set for native Fel d 1 was collected at beamline I711 at MaxLab (Lund, Sweden). The crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 43.3 Å, b = 51.5 Å, c = 67.7 Å, and β = 95.3°. The asymmetric unit contains two molecules of Fel d 1 with a molecular mass of 19,177 Da, giving a solvent content of 37.4%. The data for the SeMet-Fel d 1 protein were collected at the ID29 beam line (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The cell parameters of the crystal from SeMet protein were very similar to the native one (Table I). A fluorescence spectrum was measured, and the wavelength was set at the absorption peak. The crystals of SeMet substituted Fel d 1 decayed rather rapidly in the beam of ID29 despite attenuation of the beam. The structure was solved by single wavelength anomalons difraction experiment from the peak data set. The data were processed with the program MOSFLM (26Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55 (Pt 10): 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and scaled and reduced using SCALA from the CCP4 suite of programs (27P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55 (Pt 4): 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Six of 10 possible selenium sites in the asymmetric unit were found. The four other methionine residues were later found in flexible regions, not visible in the electron density map. The phasing power was 1.3 for acentric reflections for the resolution range 29.8–2.7 Å. The phases were extended to 2.2 Å with the use of non-crystallographic symmetry averaging and solvent flattening with the program RESOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which resulted in an interpretable electron density map. Automated chain tracing by the program RESOLVE gave an initial model comprising 67% of main chain atoms, and the remaining parts were built with the program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47 (Pt 2): 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The structural similarity with uteroglobin was recognized at an early stage of model building, and the superposition of the crystal structure of uteroglobin (Protein Data Bank code 2UTG) with the electron density map of Fel d 1 accelerated the chain-tracing process. The three disulfide bonds and the selenium positions facilitated fitting of the biological sequence to the electron density map. Crystallographic Refinement—The native data set to 1.85 Å resolution was used for the refinement, which was carried out using the program REFMAC5 (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13811) Google Scholar). Five percent of the reflections were set aside for validation. Several rounds of rebuilding with O combined with five to seven cycles of maximum likelihood refinement were performed, resulting in the final model, consisting of 283 residues. Isotropic, individual B-factor refinement was used throughout the procedure. Finally, 233 water molecules were added by ARP-WARP (32Perrikas T.K. Sixma K.S. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and their positions were checked in O. The final validation included calculation of a composite omit map (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Structural comparisons were carried out with O using default parameters. Figures were prepared with the programs WebLab ViewerLight, SwissPDB Viewer (35Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9503) Google Scholar), BobScript (36Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15 (112–133): 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar), and GRASP (37Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5314) Google Scholar). Overall Structure—The three-dimensional structure of the allergen Fel d 1 was determined to a resolution of 1.85 Å using anomalous diffraction from a selenomethionine-substituted protein crystal (Table I). The model displays good stereochemistry, and the R cryst and R free values for the refined structure are 20.3 and 23.9%, respectively (Table I). The asymmetric unit includes two Fel d 1 monomers, with 233 water molecules as well as four MPD molecules. The two monomers present in asymmetric unit are very similar in structure, with a root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.3 Å for all Cα-atoms. The final electron density map is of high quality with well-defined polypeptide chains. An example of the refined σa weighted 2Fo – Fc map is displayed in Fig. 1b. The final model of one molecule consists of residues 5 to 74 (chain 2) and 93 to 164 (chain 1). The four N-terminal and the six C-terminal histidine residues are not defined by electron density. In addition, electron density is missing for residues 75 to 92, which correspond to the C-terminal part of chain 2 (Fig. 1c), indicating disorder of this region of the molecule. Except for these residues the model is well ordered. The average B-factor of the final model is very close to the B-factor, calculated from the Wilson plot (see Table I). The fold of recombinant Fel d 1 is different from those of previously structurally characterized allergens (22Valenta R. Kraft D. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 179: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It consists of eight helices, H1–H4 and H5–H8, that correspond to chains 2 and 1, respectively, in native Fel d 1 (Fig. 1c). The N-terminal part comprising H1–H4 packs against the C-terminal part of the chain, H5–H8, forming a globular molecule of dimensions 40 × 30 × 40 Å. Three disulfide bonds, linking the N-terminal with the C-terminal half of the monomer, are found at positions Cys7–Cys162, Cys48–Cys136, and Cys73–Cys95. Using mass spectrometry, we have recently demonstrated that the disulfide bonds are identical to those described for native Fel d 1 (21Grönlund H. Bergman T. Sandström K. Alvelius G. Reininger R. Verdino P. Hauswirth A. Liderot K. Valent P. Spitzauer S. Keller W. Valenta R. van Hage-Hamsten M. J. Biol. Chem. May 5, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M301416200)Google Scholar). The parts corresponding to chain 1 and 2 in natural Fel d 1 are similar in structure, with an overall r.m.s.d. of 1.7 Å for 67 equivalent Cα atoms, despite a sequence identity of only 9%. Among the few conserved amino acids between the two chains are the six cysteines that participate in the formation of the disulfide bridges. The conservation of the three-dimensional structure in chains 1 and 2 and of the critical cysteine residues suggests a common evolutionary origin. An internal cavity is formed at the packing interface between the two halves of the molecule, and residues lining the cavity originate from practically all of the helices in the monomer. Strong residual electron density, which cannot be attributed to side chains or ordered water molecules, indicates a bound ligand within this cavity. The nature of this ligand in the recombinant protein is unknown; it has been modeled as an MPD molecule, which is present at a high concentration in the crystallization solution. In addition, six well ordered water molecules were found buried at identical positions in the cavity of each molecule. It has previously been determined that a glycosylation site is located at residue N33 in chain 2 (16Kristensen A.K. Schou C. Roepstorff P. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 899-908PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis by mass spectrometry identified the glycan as a heterogeneous tri-antennary complex structure (16Kristensen A.K. Schou C. Roepstorff P. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 899-908PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of recombinant Fel d 1 reveals that residue N33 is located in the loop connecting the H2 and H3 helices and that the side chain is exposed to the solvent (Fig. 1c). Fel d 1 occurs naturally as a tetramer composed of two identical heterodimers (15Duffort O.A. Carreira J. Nitti G. Polo F. Lombardero M. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but it is difficult to define the dimer of recombinant Fel d 1 corresponding to the native tetramer from the crystal structure. The sizes of the contact areas between either adjacent monomers in the asymmetric unit or symmetry-related molecules are very similar, ranging from 420 to 470 Å2, typical of crystal contacts rather than oligomer interfaces. Therefore, assignment of the natural tetramer is not possible. Fel d 1 Is a Member of the Secretoglobin Family—Despite an overall sequence identity with human uteroglobin of only 20%, the structure of Fel d 1 presented here reveals a striking similarity to the three-dimensional structure of the uteroglobin (38Bally R.

Biol. 1994; 1: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Sequence comparisons of the first chain of Fel d 1 with members of the uteroglobin family indicate that chain 1 is related to this protein family (14Klug J. Beier H.M. Bernard A. Chilton B.S. Fleming T.P. Lehrer R.I. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Singh G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 923: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the sequence homology between chain 2 and human uteroglobin (13% identity based on three-dimensional structural alignment) is barely detectable and has not been noted until recently (40Callebaut I. Poupon A. Bally R. Demaret J.P. Housset D. Delettre J. Hossenlopp P. Mornon J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 923: 90-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It was therefore unclear how similar the structure of Fel d 1 would be to that of uteroglobin. The overall r.m.s.d. for 124 equivalent Cα atoms after superposition of Fel d 1 and the uteroglobin dimer was 1.7 Å, whereas the r.m.s.d. of chain 1 (involving helices H1–H4) and of chain 2 (helices H5–H8) of Fel d 1 to uteroglobin are 1.2 and 1.1 Å, respectively. It should be noted that the structural similarity of chain 1 and chain 2 of Fel d 1 to uteroglobin is more pronounced than that between the two chains of Fel d 1, reflecting the higher degree of sequence identity in the primary structures. Two of the disulfide bridges are conserved between uteroglobin and Fel d 1, Cys7–Cys162, and Cys73–Cys95 (Fig. 1c). Although the third disulfide bridge at position Cys48 – Cys136 is not present in rabbit uteroglobin (38Bally R. Delettre J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 153-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the structures are very similar in the vicinity of these amino acids. In many cases residue V44 in uteroglobin (corresponding to Cys48 in Fel d 1) is exchanged to a cysteine (40Callebaut I. Poupon A. Bally R. Demaret J.P. Housset D. Delettre J. Hossenlopp P. Mornon J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 923: 90-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), indicating the possibility of a third disulfide bridge in these uteroglobin species. Native Fel d 1 exclusively forms heterodimers consisting of chains 1 and 2; a mixture of both chains results only in the formation of the heterodimer, and no homodimers of either chain 1 or chain 2 are found (19Keating K.M. Segal D.B. Craig S.J. Nault A.K. Semensi V. Wasserman A.S. Counsell C.M. Bond J.F. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). There is no detectable sequence conservation between the two chains of Fel d 1, and there is therefore no a priori indication that the interface between the two chains could be preserved in such homodimers. Indeed, models of the corresponding chain1-chain 1 and chain 2-chain 2 homodimers show that in both cases, severe sterical clashes and charge repulsion would occur, which prevent homodimer formation. The allergen Fel d 1 and the cytokine-like uteroglobin share more than a similarity in three-dimensional structure (Fig. 2b). The expression of both proteins in epithelial cells (6Charpin C. Mata P. Charpin D. Lavaut M.N. Allasia C. Vervloet D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 88: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 48Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Mantile G. Peri A. Mukherjee A.B. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1994; 17: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) is controlled and induced by steroids (49Mukherjee A.B. Kundu G.C. Mantile-Selvaggi G. Yuan C.J. Mandal A.K. Chattopadhyay S. Zheng F. Pattabiraman N. Zhang Z. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 771-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 50Charpin C. Zielonka T.M. Charpin D. Ansaldi J.L.

Allergy. 1994; 24: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The structural similarities of the two proteins suggest that anti-Fel d 1 antibodies might cross-react with uteroglobin, hypothetically decreasing the anti-inflammatory properties of the latter (49Mukherjee A.B. Kundu G.C. Mantile-Selvaggi G. Yuan C.J. Mandal A.K. Chattopadhyay S. Zheng F. Pattabiraman N. Zhang Z. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 771-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and thereby aggravating the allergic disease. Despite the low sequence identity between Fel d 1 and uteroglobin, three clusters composed of identical residues are present on the surface of the two molecules: cluster 1 (Thr-109, Pro-110, Asp-138) cluster 2 (Glu-5, Pro-8, Lys-155, Leu-161), and cluster 3 (Cys-73, Cys-95, Pro-96, and Glu-93). These clusters may form the basis for cross-reactive epitopes in Fel d 1 and uteroglobin. The structural similarity between Fel d 1 and uteroglobin may also suggest that the allergen harbors cytokine-like properties, rendering it capable of modulating the immune response. The Ligand-binding Cavity of Fel d 1 Is Different from That of Uteroglobin—The shape of the cavity within Fel d 1 differs from the corresponding cavity within uteroglobin (Fig. 3, a and b). The size of the pocket is smaller (480 Å3) than in uteroglobin (750 Å3). Furthermore, the Fel d 1 cavity is asymmetric. One part of the cavity is lined by only hydrophobic residues, whereas polar and charged residues dominate on the opposite site. The hydrophilic end is created by two buried aspartic acids, Asp-60 and Asp-101 and two polar tyrosines Tyr-49 and Tyr-113 (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the cavity in homodimeric uteroglobin is symmetrical, mainly composed of hydrophobic residues, with one tyrosine from each chain (Tyr-21 and Tyr-21′) at opposite ends of the cavity (Fig. 3, c and d). It has been demonstrated that uteroglobin is a carrier of small ligands such as polychlorinated biphenyl derivatives, phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl choline, retinol, and progesterone (41Härd T. Barnes H.J. Larsson C. Gustafsson J.Å. Lund J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 47Umland T.C. Swaminathan S. Singh G. Warty V. Furey W. Pletcher J.

Zhang Z. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 771-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The tyrosine residue Tyr-21 is involved in the binding of ligands to uteroglobin (41Härd T. Barnes H.J. Larsson C. Gustafsson J.Å. Lund J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the mutation of this position to alanine or phenylalanine results in a dramatic decrease of progesterone binding to uteroglobin (52Peter W. Bruller H.J. Vriend G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 38: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The particular distribution of residues in the cavity of Fel d 1 provides an amphipathic character to the cavity, which may be related to the physicochemical properties of the endogenous ligand. Structural Localization of IgE Epitopes—The only curative treatment for allergy today is immunotherapy, based on repeated subcutaneous injections of allergen (53Bousquet J. Lockey R. Malling H.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 102: 558-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). One major disadvantage of current immunotherapy is that it can cause severe side effects, such as asthma attacks and anaphylactic shock. To overcome these problems, new strategies have been developed to reduce the allergenic potential of allergens (54Valenta R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The identification of IgE epitopes on allergens allows the modification of important allergens such that they display strongly reduced allergenic activity by disrupting the conformational IgE epitopes. Such hypoallergenic allergen derivatives can be used as candidates for vaccines in allergen-specific immunotherapy, with a reduced risk of immediate side effects (54Valenta R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Three important IgE epitopes have been defined on the Fel d 1 allergen using 14-residue overlapping peptides spanning both chains, two in chain 1 (residues 25–38 and 46–59) and one in chain 2 (residues 15–28) (55van Milligen F.J. van't Hof W. van den Berg M. Aalberse R.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 93: 34-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Epitopes 25–38 (corresponding to 117–130 in the construct), 46–59 (138–151 in the construct), and 15–28 (15–28 in the construct) are located on the neighboring helices H6–H7, H7–H8, and H1–H2, respectively, and connecting loops (Fig. 4). Interestingly, epitope 117–130 was recognized by 46% of the analyzed patient sera (55van Milligen F.J. van't Hof W. van den Berg M. Aalberse R.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 93: 34-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Fel d 1 reveals that the side chains of residues Gln-119, Leu-123, Pro-124, Glu-128, Ala-139, Glu-143, Glu-144, and Glu-147 in chain 1 and residues Phe-15, Asn-19, Glu-22, Leu-23, and Leu-27 in chain 2 are exposed to the solvent and are thereby available for IgE binding (Fig. 4). The purpose of this study was to determine the structure of the major cat allergen Fel d 1. Herein, we report that the crystal structure of Fel d 1, resolved at 1.85 Å resolution, displays a striking structural similarity to that of uteroglobin, a steroid-inducible, cytokine-like molecule with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The three-dimensional structure of Fel d 1 provides a framework for further studies aimed at understanding the pathogenesis of and creating new tools for diagnosis and therapy of cat allergy."

In a search for the acyltransferases that acylate the GPI anchors of PIM, LM, and LAM, we examined the function of the mycobacterial Rv2611c gene that encodes a putative acyltransferase involved in the early steps of phosphatidylinositol mannoside synthesis. A Rv2611c mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis was constructed which exhibited severe growth defects and contained an increased amount of phosphatidylinositol mono- and di-mannosides and a decreased amount of acylated phosphatidylinositol di-mannosides compared with the wild-type parental strain. In cell-free assays, extracts from M. smegmatis overexpressing the M. tuberculosis Rv2611c gene incorporated [14C]palmitate into acylated phosphatidylinositol mono- and di-mannosides, and transferred cold endogenous fatty acids onto 14C-labeled phosphatidylinositol mono- and di-mannosides more efficiently than extracts from the wild-type strain. Cell-free extracts from the Rv2611c mutant of M. smegmatis were greatly impaired in these respects. This work provides evidence that Rv2611c is the acyltransferase that catalyzes the acylation of the 6-position of the mannose residue linked to position 2 of myo-inositol in phosphatidylinositol mono- and di-mannosides, with the mono-mannosylated lipid acceptor being the primary substrate of the enzyme.

The first step in PIM synthesis involves the transfer of a mannose residue from GDP-Man to the 2-position of the myo-inositol ring of PI to form the phosphatidylinositol monomannoside, PIM1 (3Korduláková J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 895-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This lipid or its acylated counterpart (Ac1PIM1) then accepts another mannose residue (Man) at the 6-position of myo-Ins to form phosphatidylinositol dimannoside (PIM2) or acylated phosphatidylinositol dimannoside (Ac1PIM2), respectively (20Brennan P.J.

It is thought that PIM2 or Ac1PIM2 then undergo several glycosylation steps with Man and then with Ara to form higher PIM (PIM3-PIM6) and the highly branched lipoglycans, LM and LAM (18Besra G.S.

It may be inferred from the studies of Takayama and Goldman (31Takayama K. Goldman D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 176: 196-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that acylated PIM1 (Ac1PIM1) is a more potent substrate for the second mannosylation step than is PIM1. Therefore, the acylation reaction responsible for the formation of Ac1PIM1 may constitute a key regulatory event in determining the synthesis of the final PIM, LM, and LAM products.Acylating activities have been reported by Brennan and Ballou (20Brennan P.J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3046-3056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Brennan P.J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2975-2984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the membrane fraction of Mycobacterium phlei. Acylated PIM2 (Ac1PIM2) were the main products formed in the reaction when endogenous or crude mycobacterial phospholipids were used as the lipid acceptors and acyl-CoA derivatives of fatty acids (myristic, palmitic, and oleic acids) were used as 14C-labeled substrates. These results, together with the previous observation of the formation of PIM1 from PI in M. phlei (30Hill D.L. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 895-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), led the authors to propose two models for the early steps of PIM synthesis in Mycobacterium spp. (20Brennan P.J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3046-3056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Brennan P.J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2975-2984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (Fig. 1). In the first proposed pathway, PI is mannosylated to form PIM1. PIM1 is then mannosylated to PIM2, which is acylated to form Ac1PIM2. In the second pathway, which appears to be more consistent with the observations subsequently published by Takayama and Goldman (31Takayama K. Goldman D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 176: 196-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), PIM1 is first acylated to Ac1PIM1 and then mannosylated to Ac1PIM2. Since these early studies, no further work on the acylation steps of PIM, LM, and LAM has been undertaken, and the genes underlying the acyltransferase activities described by Brennan and Ballou (20Brennan P.J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3046-3056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Brennan P.J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2975-2984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have not been identified.Recently, we identified a cluster of five ORF apparently dedicated to the early steps of PIM synthesis in Mycobacterium spp. (2Jackson M. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The first ORF of this cluster (Rv2613c) encodes a protein of unknown function. The second ORF encodes PgsA, the previously characterized phosphatidylinositol synthase (2Jackson M. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The third ORF (Rv2611c) encodes a protein with similarities to bacterial acyltransferases. The fourth ORF encodes PimA, the α-mannosyltransferase responsible for the formation of PIM1 from PI and GDP-Man (3Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikus̆ová K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31335-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the fifth ORF, Rv2609c, encodes a putative GDP-Man hydrolase carrying a mutT domain signature (PS00893). This genetic organization suggests that Rv2611c encodes an acyltransferase involved in the acylation of phosphatidylinositol mono- and di-mannosides. Rv2611c is present in all of the mycobacterial genomes sequenced so far and has a homolog in Streptomyces coelicolor (43% identity for a 296 amino acid overlap), an actinomycete that shares the ability to synthesize PIM with mycobacteria (34Brennan P.J. Ratledge C. Wilkinson S.G. Microbial Lipids. Vol. 1. Academic Press Ltd., London1988: 203-298Google Scholar).In this report, we provide evidence that Rv2611c is the acyltransferase responsible for the acylation of the 6-position of the Manp residue linked to position 2 of myo-Ins. PIM1 appeared to be the main lipid acceptor in the reaction although the enzyme could also acylate PIM2. We show that the Rv2611c gene is not essential for growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis although its disruption induces dramatic changes in the PIM content of this strain accompanied by severe growth defects in both solid and liquid media. The dispensability of Rv2611c appears to be related, at least partly, to the ability of the mutant to synthesize Ac1PIM2 from PIM2. Altogether, these observations provide evidence that the two pathways leading to the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol di-mannosides originally proposed by Brennan and Ballou (20Brennan P.J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3046-3056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Brennan P.J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2975-2984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) co-exist in mycobacteria.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli XL1-blue, the strain used for cloning experiments was propagated in Luria Bertani (LB) broth (pH 7.5) (Bactotryptone, 10 g/liter, Bacto™ yeast extract, 5 g/liter, NaCl, 5 g/liter) (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) at 37 °C. M. smegmatis strain mc2155 (35Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) was routinely grown at 37 °Cin LB broth supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80. LB medium was used as the solid medium for all bacteria. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; kanamycin, 20 μg/ml; hygromycin, 50 μg/ml. When required, 10 g/liter NaCl was added to the liquid LB medium, and 10% sucrose was added to the solid medium.Cloning Procedures, Mycobacterial Genomic DNA Extraction, and Southern Blotting Analysis—Molecular cloning, restriction endonuclease digestions, and DNA purification were performed by standard techniques according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Electrocompetent E. coli XL1-blue and M. smegmatis cells were prepared and transformed as previously described (3Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikus̆ová K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31335-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Isolation of mycobacterial genomic DNA, labeling of DNA probes with [α-32P]dCTP and Southern blot analyses were performed as previously described (3Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikus̆ová K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31335-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Construction of the M. smegmatis Rv2611c Mutant—The Rv2611c gene of M. smegmatis was disrupted by use of a two-step homologous recombination procedure. This method relies upon the use of a suicide vector harboring the counterselectable marker sacB and a kanamycin cassette-disrupted copy of the gene of interest. In the first step of the experiment, a single crossover strain is isolated and cultured at 37 °Cin the presence of kanamycin. In the second step of the experiment, the single crossover strain culture is plated out on sucrose-Km plates to select clones that underwent a second intrachromosomal crossover event leading to the excision of the body of the vector and allelic replacement.The M. smegmatis Rv2611c gene and flanking regions were excised from the plasmid pUCpgsA.Sm (2Jackson M. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) on a 3.7-Kb BamHI restriction fragment and inserted into the BamHI site of pUC18, yielding pUC-acylT. A disrupted allele of the Rv2611c gene, Rv2611c::Km, was then constructed by cloning the kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences), carried on a 1.2-Kb HincII restriction fragment, into the AgeI-cut and blunt-ended pUCacylT. This digestion by AgeI resulted in the deletion of 121 bp of the Rv2611c coding sequence. Rv2611c::Km was then excised from the resulting plasmid on a 4.8-kb BamHI restriction fragment, blunt-ended, and inserted into the SmaI site of pXYL4 (a pBlueScript derivative carrying the xylE colored marker) (36Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) yielding pX4acylTK. Finally, pJQacylT, the construct used for allelic replacement, was obtained by transferring a 5.8-Kb BamHI fragment from pX4acylTK containing Rv2611c::Km and XylE, into the BamHI site of pJQ200, an E. coli cloning vector carrying the counters-electable marker sacB.Overexpression of the M. tuberculosis Rv2611c Gene in M. smegmatis and Purification of the Recombinant His-tagged Rv2611c Protein— Standard PCR strategies with TaqDNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Roche Applied Science) were used to amplify the M. tuberculosis Rv2611c gene. PCR amplification consisted of one denaturation step (95 °C, 6 min) followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 1 min), annealing (68 °C, 1 min), and primer extension (72 °C, 2 min), and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The primers were AcylT1 (5′-ctttaaccatatgacactttccggccgcatcccg-3′) and AcylT2 (5′-cccaagcttggttcccaaccgtgcgcggcgc-3′). The primers were designed to generate a PCR product corresponding to the entire Rv2611c gene devoid of its stop codon and harboring NdeI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined in the primers sequences) to enable direct cloning into the pVV16 expression vector (2Jackson M. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). pVV16 harbors a kanamycin and a hygromycin resistance marker. In this vector, genes are constitutively expressed under the control of the hsp60 transcription and translation signals. Recombinant proteins produced with this system carry a His6 tag at their carboxyl terminus. Wild-type M. smegmatis mc2155 and its Rv2611c mutant, MYC1573, were transformed with the resulting expression vector, pVVacylT, and transformants were selected on LB-Km-Hyg plates. The production of recombinant Rv2611c protein in M. smegmatis was analyzed by Western blotting, as previously described (3Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikus̆ová K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31335-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For the purification of recombinant His-tagged Rv2611c protein, M. smegmatis mc2155/pVVacylT cells (11 g wet weight) were washed and resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.45) before probe sonication for 7 min at 4 °C in the form of 7 × 60-s pulses with 90-s cooling intervals between pulses. The unbroken cells and bacterial debris were removed by centrifugation of the sonicate at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Recombinant His-tagged Rv2611c protein was purified from the supernatant of this centrifugation using the BD TALON™ Resin (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the supplier's recommendations. Unbound proteins were removed by washing the resin with buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl. Proteins bound to the resin were then gradually eluted with buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl and increasing concentrations of imidazole (10, 50, 100, 200, and 500 mm). Recombinant Rv2611c protein was detected in the fractions eluted with 100, 200, and 500 mm imidazole. These fractions were pooled and desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting protein preparation was significantly enriched in recombinant Rv2611c.Whole Cell Radiolabeling Experiment—Radiolabeling of whole M. smegmatis mc2155/pVV16, mc2155/pVVacylT, MYC1573, and MYC1573/pVVacylT cells with [1,2-14C]acetic acid (specific activity 113 mCi/mmol, ICN) or myo-[2-3H]inositol (specific activity 17.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was performed in LB medium supplemented with 10 g/liter NaCl, kanamycin, and hygromycin; radiolabeled precursors (0.5 μCi/ml) were added to mid-log cultures, and cultures were incubated at 37 °C for a further 8 or 24 h, respectively, with shaking.Cell-free Assays using [1-14C]Palmitic Acid, [14C]GDP-Man, and 14C-labeled Putative Lipid Substrates—Membrane, cytosol, and cell wall-membrane (P60) fractions of M. smegmatis mc2155, MYC1573 and mc2155/pVVacylT cells were prepared as described previously (3Korduláková J.

For an initial comparison of PIM production in each strain, the whole cell lysate obtained by sonication was used in a reaction containing 4 mg of protein, 0.25 μCi of [14C]GDP-Man, (specific activity, 305 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), 62.5 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.45) in a final volume of 250 μl. In the assays using [1-14C]palmitic acid as the substrate, [14C]GDP-Man was replaced by 0.0625 μCi of [1-14C]palmitic acid (specific activity, 40–60 mCi/mmol, ICN) and the reaction mixtures were supplemented with 100 μm CoA (Sigma) and 10 μm GDP-Man (Sigma). Membrane and cell wall-membrane (P60) fractions (0.25 mg of protein in both cases) were used as enzyme sources. After 1 h at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). The samples were rocked for 30 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The upper aqueous phase was discarded and the bottom organic phase was washed with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (1:47:48, v/v). The final organic phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen and dissolved in 100 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v) before scintillation counting and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis.Radiolabeled putative lipid substrates for the acyltransferase reaction, namely [14C]PIM1 and [14C]PIM2, were purified by preparative TLC. [14C]PIM1 was generated in vitro in a reaction containing [14C]GDP-Man and M. smegmatis mc2155 membranes supplemented with crude extracts from E. coli overproducing PimA (E. coli BL21/pETpimA) (3Korduláková J.

[14C]PIM2 was obtained from total lipid extracts of MYC1573 (20-ml culture) labeled in vivo with [1,2-14C]acetate (the mutant strain produced more of this lipid than the wild-type strain). For cell-free assays, [14C]PIM1 or [14C]PIM2 were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and dried under nitrogen. 50 μm palmitic acid (Sigma), 100 μm CoA (Sigma), 62.5 μm ATP, membrane fraction (0.1 mg of protein), cell wall membrane (P60) fraction (0.1 mg of protein), and buffer A were added to a final volume of 50 μl, and the reaction mixtures were bath-sonicated for 1 min. After 3 h at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 300 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). The lipids were extracted as described above and analyzed by TLC.In situ formation of the putative radioactive substrate of Rv2611c, [14C]PIM1, was achieved by including crude extracts of E. c"
https://openalex.org/W2003405170,"Clostridium perfringens beta toxin is known to be the primary pathogenic factor of necrotic enteritis in the type C strains that produce beta toxin. The toxin was purified from the supernatant fluid of a culture controlled at pH 7.5 using an anti-alpha toxin affinity column (1Sakurai J. Duncan C.L. Infect. Immun. 1977; 8: 741-745Crossref Google Scholar) or Toyopearl HW 60 column (2Sakurai J. Fujii Y. Toxicon. 1987; 25: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Beta toxin possesses lethal, dermonecrotic, and pressor activities (3Sakurai J. Nagahama M. Ochi S. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1997; 16: 195-214Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, we also reported that the plasma extravasation induced by beta toxin in mouse skin is mediated via a mechanism involving tachykinin NK1 receptors (4Nagahama M. Morimitsu S. Kihara A. Akita M. Setsu K. Sakurai J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By using an oligonucleotide probe designed on the basis of the N-terminal sequence of the purified toxin, the beta toxin gene was isolated from C. perfringens type B (5Hunter S.E. Brown J.E. Oyston P.C. Sakurai J. Titball R.W. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3958-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of beta toxin was found to have significant homology with that of Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin (28% similarity), the A and B components of gamma toxin (22 and 28% similarity, respectively), and the S and F components of leukocidin (17 and 28%, respectively) (5Hunter S.E. Brown J.E. Oyston P.C. Sakurai J. Titball R.W. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3958-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The alpha toxin is known to form an oligomer in biological membranes and artificial membranes (6Tomita T. Watanabe M. Yasuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13391-13397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Valeva A. Weisser A. Walker B. Kehoe M. Bayley H. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8Montoya M. Gouaux E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The alpha toxin is the prototype of a family of these toxins with membrane-damaging activity. On the basis of crystallographic findings of the alpha toxin, the structure of the oligomer of the alpha toxin is divided into four domains. First, the cap of the oligomer is composed of seven β-sandwiches and the N-terminal region. Second, the stem domain forms a transmembrane channel. Third, the rim domain protrudes from the underside of the oligomer, participates in some protomer-protomer interactions, and interacts with the lipid bilayer. Fourth, the triangle region participates in a crucial protomer-protomer interaction (9Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Beta toxin has regions corresponding to the cap, the triangle region, the rim domain, and the stem domain of alpha toxin, according to the conserved amino acid sequences of the family (5Hunter S.E. Brown J.E. Oyston P.C. Sakurai J. Titball R.W. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3958-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Beta toxin has only one cysteine residue at position 265 (5Hunter S.E. Brown J.E. Oyston P.C. Sakurai J. Titball R.W. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3958-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the toxin is inactivated by thiol group modifying reagents (10Sakurai J. Fujii Y. Matsuura M. Microbiol. Immunol. 1980; 24: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Sakurai J. Fujii Y. Nagahama M. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It therefore was speculated that the Cys residue is important in the lethal activity of the toxin. However, Steinthorsdottir et al. (12Steinthorsdottir V. Fridriksdottir V. Gunnarsson E. Andresson O.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 158: 17-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that replacement of the Cys residue did not affect the toxin activity. Furthermore, we also reported that the replacement of Cys-265 with alanine did not affect the activity of beta toxin and resulted in thiol group reagents having no effect on the activity (13Nagahama M. Kihara A. Miyawaki T. Mukai M. Sakaguchi Y. Ochi S. Sakurai J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence surrounding Cys-265 in the C terminus of beta toxin (positions 255 to 276) is homologous to that at positions 245-267 in the C terminus of the alpha toxin (a conserved 11-amino acid sequence). Thus it appears that Cys-265 in beta toxin corresponds to Asp-255 in the alpha toxin. Walker and Bayley (14Walker B. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23065-23071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) reported that treatment of D254C and D255C (variant toxins of the alpha toxin) with sulfhydryl-modifying reagent, 4′-acetamido-4-((iodoacetyl)amino)stilbene-2,2′-disulfonate, resulted in a significant reduction or complete loss of binding, oligomer formation, and hemolytic activity, suggesting that the C terminus containing Asp-254 and -255 of the alpha toxin is implicated in binding to cells. Y266A and L268G surrounding Cys-265 in beta toxin showed no lethal activity and did not inhibit lethal activity of the toxin, suggesting that Tyr-266 and Leu-268 play a role in binding to the receptor (13Nagahama M. Kihara A. Miyawaki T. Mukai M. Sakaguchi Y. Ochi S. Sakurai J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the characteristics of beta toxin resemble those of the alpha toxin. Steinthorsdottir et al. (15Steinthorsdottir V. Halldorsson H. Andresson O.S. Microb. Pathog. 2000; 28: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that beta toxin formed oligomeric complexes on the membranes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and induced the release of arachidonic acid and inositol from these cells. Shatursky et al. (16Shatursky O. Bayles R. Rogers M. Jost B.H. Songer J.G. Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5546-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the lethal action of beta toxin is based on the formation of cation-selective pores in the lipid bilayers. However, little is known about the precise mechanism of formation of oligomers of beta toxin and the relationship between the biological activities and oligomer formation of the toxin. Direct evidence concerning the formation of the membrane pore and biological activities is lacking due to the absence of a susceptible cell line for in vitro studies of beta toxin activity. In this study, we attempted to find cell lines that are susceptible to beta toxin. We demonstrate the binding of the toxin in cell and oligomer formation of the toxin in biological membranes. Furthermore, we report here a relationship between the biological activities and oligomer formation of the toxin.

Polyethylene glycol 200, 300, 400, 600, and 1000 were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). ω-Conotoxin, charybdotoxin, and margatoxin were purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Mouse anti-caveolin-1 and Lyn antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 medium were purchased from Invitrogen. The fluorescent probes, sodium green and N-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-6-methoxyquinolinium bromide (MQAE), were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were of the highest grade available from commercial sources. Beta Toxin and Derivative—The expression and purification of recombinant beta toxin were performed as described previously (13Nagahama M. Kihara A. Miyawaki T. Mukai M. Sakaguchi Y. Ochi S. Sakurai J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To prepare beta toxin derivative (BTD) for labeling of the toxin, plasmid pTB-1 containing the entire beta toxin gene (13Nagahama M. Kihara A. Miyawaki T. Mukai M. Sakaguchi Y. Ochi S. Sakurai J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR to add BamHI site and EcoRI site for subcloning into the vector using a forward primer 5′-GGGGATCCAATGATATAGGTAAAAC-3′(BamHI site is underlined) and a reverse primer 5′-GGGTTAACGATATAGGTAAAACTAC-3′ (EcoRI site is underlined). The PCR products digested with BamHI and EcoRI were inserted into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences). The resultant plasmid, named pGE2BXT, enabled the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-beta toxin derivative (GST-BTD) which contained a pentapeptide recognized by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The accuracy of the final DNA construction was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells—Cell lines (Vero cells, CHO cells, CHO-K1 cells, COS-7 cells, intestine 407 cells, HeLa cells, MDCK cells, PC12 cells, mouse mastocytoma P-815 cells, and HL 60 cells) were obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Vero cells, CHO cells, CHO-K1 cells, COS-7 cells, intestine 407 cells, HeLa cells, and MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 2 mm glutamine. P-815 cells and HL 60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. All incubation steps were carried out at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Mouse Lethality Test and Cytotoxicity Assay—The lethality of beta toxin and its derivative toward mice was determined as described previously (13Nagahama M. Kihara A. Miyawaki T. Mukai M. Sakaguchi Y. Ochi S. Sakurai J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A group of 6 male ddY mice weighing about 25 g each was injected intravenously with 0.1 ml of the toxin solution, and deaths occurring within 24 h were recorded. For cytotoxicity assays, cells were seeded in 48-well culture plates (1 × 105 cells in 0.2 ml/well) and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. Beta toxin was added to each well and additionally incubated for a further 12 h. After the incubation, the cells in each well were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing Mg2+ and Ca2+. Cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt conversion assay (Promega, Madison, WI). The absorbance was read at 490 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Percentage of cell viability was calculated as follows: the mean absorbance value of a toxin group/that of a control. Release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from HL 60 cells was determined with a microplate assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Ion Assays—HL 60 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were inoculated in 6-well plates in Hanks' balanced solution (HBSS). For the K+ efflux assay, the cells were incubated with the toxin at 37 °C for various times. K+ concentrations in the supernatants were determined at the given times with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Hitachi Z-8200, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (17Nagahama M. Nagayasu K. Kobayashi K Sakurai J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1909-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the Ca2+ influx assay, beta toxin and 5 × 105 cpm of 45Ca2+ (11.92 mCi/mg, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for various times. After washing the cells with HBSS three times, the radioactivity in the cells was counted with a scintillation counter (Aloka Co., Tokyo, Japan). For the Na+ and Cl- influx assay, fluorescence probes were used according to the methods described by Petit et al. (18Petit L. Maier E. Gibert M. Popoff M.R. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15736-15740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After incubation of HL 60 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) with the toxin in HBSS at 37 °C for various times, the cells were washed with 25 mm MOPS (pH 7) containing 150 mm glucose (MOPS/glucose) and lysed with 1% Triton X-100. Each fluorescent probe was added to the lysed cells to a final concentration of 10 μm for sodium green (Na+ assay) and MQAE (Cl- assay). The fluorescence intensity of sodium green and MQAE was measured in a microplate fluorometer MTP-32 (Corona Electric Co., Katsuda, Japan) with the following filters: excitation 485 nm and emission 538 nm for sodium green and excitation 355 nm and emission 475 nm for MQAE. The data are expressed as percents of fluorescence intensity from the toxin-untreated cells (control) (18Petit L. Maier E. Gibert M. Popoff M.R. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15736-15740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Estimation of the Functional Diameter of the Membrane Pore—Toxin-induced lysis of HL 60 cells was assayed at 37 °C in HBSS containing polyethylene glycols of different sizes at a concentration equivalent to 40 mOsm. The total osmotic pressure of the extracellular space was adjusted to 295 mOsm by changing the concentrations of NaCl. The values for the hydrodynamic diameters of polyethylene glycols were taken from the reports of Scherrer and Gerhardt (19Scherrer R. Gerhardt P. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 718-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Sabirov et al. (20Sabirov R.Z. Krasilnikov O.V. Ternovsky V.I. Merzliak P.G. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1993; 12: 95-111PubMed Google Scholar), where the hydrodynamic diameters were calculated on the basis of the viscosity of the polyethylene glycol solutions. Preparation of Radiolabeled Toxin Derivatives—Beta toxin was radiolabeled with 125I by the following two methods. The purified toxin (15 μg) was incubated with 36.2 GBq of Na125I (643.8 GBq/mg; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and IOAD-BEADS iodination reagent (Pierce) in 60 μl of phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. Beta toxin (15 μg) was incubated with 250 μCi of 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent (74 TBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (17Nagahama M. Nagayasu K. Kobayashi K Sakurai J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1909-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Radioiodinated proteins were separated from free iodine by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (0.75 × 10 cm; Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl). The specific activity of Na125I-labeled and 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent-labeled beta toxin was 440 and 560 kcpm/μg protein, respectively. Phosphorylation of BTD with 32P was performed as follows. Approximately 200 μg of GST-BTD was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (bed volume, 200 μl; Amersham Biosciences), and then phosphorylated using the catalytic subunit of bovine heart protein kinase (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP (167 TBq/mmol; ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The specific activity of 32P-labeled GST-BTD was about 32 kcpm/μg protein. 32P-BTD was prepared from 32P-labeled GST-BTD by cleavage at the thrombin-specific site within the C-terminal portion in a GST linker sequence (see “Results”). Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—Separation of lipid rafts was carried out by flotation-centrifugation on a sucrose gradient (21Waheed A.A. Shimada Y. Heijnen H.F. Nakamura M. Inomata M. Hayashi M.

Salamero J. Johannes L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2453-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). HL 60 cells were incubated in fresh medium containing 500 ng/ml 32P-BTD at 37 °C for various times. The cells were rinsed with HBSS and treated or untreated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C in HBSS containing the protease inhibitor mixture and sonicated for 20-s pulses (two and six times, respectively) using a tip-type sonicator. The lysates were adjusted to 40% sucrose (w/v), overlaid with 2.4 ml of 36% sucrose and 1.2 ml of 5% sucrose in HBSS, centrifuged at 45,000 rpm (250,000 × g) for 18 h at 4 °C in a SW55 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA), and fractionated from the top (0.4 ml each, a total of 10 fractions). The aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. Immunoblot Analysis of Lipid Raft Marker Proteins—Aliquots of the flotation sucrose gradient fractions were heated in 2% SDS-sample buffer at 99 °C for 3 min. The samples were electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE gel, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with TBS containing 2% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk and incubated first with the primary antibody in TBS containing 1% skim milk, then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and finally with an enhanced chemiluminescence analysis kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cholesterol Depletion and Repletion—To remove cholesterol, HL 60 cells (2-4 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 10 mm MβCD in HBSS and then washed with HBSS. For the cholesterol repletion experiment (22Falguieres T. Mallard F. Baron C. Hanau D. Lingwood C. Goud B. Salamero J. Johannes L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2453-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), 40 mg of cholesterol was coated on the walls of a glass tube, and 5 ml of 50 mm MβCD in HBSS was added and incubated after sonication for 15 h at 37 °C. The resulting solution (50 mm MβCD/cholesterol) was filtered and added back to cholesterol-depleted cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of MβCD/cholesterol. Cholesterol contents were assayed spectrophotometrically using a diagnostic kit (Cholesterol C-Test, Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) Liposomes—DOPC-cholesterol (1:1) liposomes containing carboxyfluorescein (CF) were prepared, and CF release was monitored by a procedure described previously (23Nagahama M. Michiue K. Sakurai J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The binding of 32P-BTD to liposomes was performed as described previously (23Nagahama M. Michiue K. Sakurai J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Morphological Alterations of Cells Induced by Beta Toxin—HL 60 cells were small and round, and displayed distinct dark outlines, as shown in Fig. 1A, when the cells were observed by phase-contrast microscopy. However, when HL 60 cells were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml of beta toxin at 37 °C, the cells began to swell within 1 h, and a large number of cells became swollen and translucent within 2 h, but the blebs did not, as shown in Fig. 1B. At this time, swollen cells with a granular-like nucleus not seen in control cells were observed. However, DNA from cells treated with the toxin did not exhibit laddering classically associated with apoptosis (data not shown), suggesting that changes in the nuclei of cells treated with the toxin do not occur under these conditions. The cells were completely lysed after 6 h of incubation (data not shown). When the cells were incubated with the toxin at concentrations from 0.5 to 10.0 μg/ml at 37 °C for 1 h, swollen cell counts increased in a dose-dependent manner under the conditions (data not shown). The effects of beta toxin on various cell lines (Vero cells, CHO cells, MDCK cells, CHO-K1 cells, COS-7 cells, P-815 cells, PC12 cells, HeLa cells, and intestine 407 cells) were investigated. The toxin had no effect on these cell lines, even when incubated with 50 μg/ml of the toxin at 37 °C for 12 h (data not shown). Our data show that, of the 10 cell lines tested, only the HL 60 cell line was susceptible to beta toxin. Efflux of K + and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) and Influx of Ca 2+ , Na + , and Cl - in the Cells Treated with Beta Toxin—To test whether beta toxin affects the membrane permeability of the cells, we measured the efflux of K+ and LDH from the cells and the influx of Ca2+, Na+, and Cl- into the cells. HL 60 cells were incubated with various concentrations of beta toxin in HBSS at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 2A, beta toxin at concentrations from 0.5 to 5.0 μg/ml induced efflux of K+ from the cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Incubation of the cells in the absence of beta toxin at 37 °C or in the presence of beta toxin at 4 °C induced no efflux of K+ (data not shown). Furthermore, when the cells were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml of beta toxin at 4 °C for 2 h, washed, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, efflux of K+ was observed (data not shown). Fig. 2B shows that the toxin (5.0 μg/ml) induced influx of Ca2+, Na+, and Cl- and that these events reached a maximum after1hof incubation at 37 °C. Beta toxin at concentrations below 5.0 μg/ml induced LDH leakage from HL 60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as shown in Fig. 2A. LDH release induced by 5.0 μg/ml of beta toxin began after 1 h and reached a maximum after 6 h, showing that lysis of the cells began after 1 h of incubation of the cells with the toxin and was complete after 6 h. It therefore is likely that release of K+ and uptake of Ca2+, Na+, and Cl- induced by the toxin increased until lysis of the cells began. The Effect of Polyethylene Glycols on the Events Induced by the Toxin—To test whether the toxin forms functional pores in HL 60 cells, the cells were incubated with beta toxin in the presence of various sizes of polyethylene glycols at 37 °C for 60 min, and the effects of the polyethylene glycols on the toxin-induced K+ efflux, Ca2+ influx, and swelling of cells were investigated (Table I). The toxin induced no swelling of the cells in the presence of polyethylene glycols 600 and 1000 (molecular size of 1.6 and 1.8 nm, respectively), and the toxin induced Ca2+ influx by about 25% of the control under these conditions. Polyethylene glycols with a molecular size of 1.12, 1.16, and 1.36 nm blocked the toxin-induced swelling and Ca2+ influx in a size-dependent manner. However, these polyethylene glycols had no effect on toxin-induced K+ efflux. To investigate whether K+ efflux and Ca2+ influx induced by the toxin are dependent on the activation of K+ and Ca2+ channels, the effect of these channel blockers on these events was tested. Ca2+ channel blockers, verapamil (10 μM), and ω-conotoxin SVIB (2 μm), and K+ channel blockers, 4-aminopyridine (10 mm), tetraethylammonium (60 mm), charybdotoxin (5.0 μm), quinidine (50 μm), and margatoxin (10 nm) had no effect on the toxin-induced swelling and events of the cells (data not shown).Table IEffect of polyethylene glycols with different hydrodynamic diameters on beta toxin-induced actions in HL 60 cellsPolyethylene glycolsK+ effluxaK+ efflux and Ca2+ influx are expressed as a percentage of the data in the absence of polyethylene glycol.Ca2+ influxaK+ efflux and Ca2+ influx are expressed as a percentage of the data in the absence of polyethylene glycol.Cell swellingHydrodynamic diameter of PEG%nmNone101.0 ± 6.4100.5 ± 9.2+ + +−PEG20095.4 ± 5.372.8 ± 13.2+ + +1.12PEG30096.8 ± 4.150.5 ± 8.8bp <0.05.+ + +1.16PEG40095.1 ± 3.831.4 ± 4.9cp <0.01.+ +1.36PEG60094.2 ± 4.925.8 ± 5.2cp <0.01.−1.60PEG100095.0 ± 5.525.4 ± 4.7cp <0.01.−1.80a K+ efflux and Ca2+ influx are expressed as a percentage of the data in the absence of polyethylene glycol.b p <0.05.c p <0.01.

Shin J.S. Abraham S.N. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To test the toxin binding to the cells, the toxin was radiolabeled with Na125I using IODO-BEADS iodination reagent, to modify tyrosine residues, and 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent, to modify amino group. However, these labeled toxins drastically lost lethal activity in mouse. To resolve this problem, we constructed a GST-beta toxin fusion protein containing a protein kinase recognition site (RRXSV) at the N terminus of the toxin (Fig. 3). The fusion protein was purified, phosphorylated with protein kinase in the presence of [32P]ATP, and cleaved with thrombin. The phosphorylated beta toxin derivative (32P-BTD) showed no loss of lethal activity, compared with that of the wild-type toxin. To investigate the possible interaction of beta toxin with lipid rafts of HL 60 cells, 32P-BTD was incubated with HL 60 cells in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 15 and 30 min, and the cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The Triton X-100-insoluble components were fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography. Low density fractions (fractions 3-5) showed three of the labeled bands of about 35 kDa, which is the expected size of monomeric toxin, and of about 191 and 228 kDa, which are the expected sizes of hexameric and heptameric toxins, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4A. These results suggest that these oligomers of beta toxin are associated with the detergent-insoluble fraction. When the cells were incubated with the toxin at 37 °C for 60 min, the detergent-insoluble fractions showed two faint labeled bands at 35 and 191 kDa (Fig. 4A), indicating that the oligomer at 228 kDa disappeared within 1 h. When raft markers in the fractions obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation were analyzed using anti-caveolin-1 and anti-Lyn, caveolin-1 and Lyn were only detected in the low density fractions (fractions 3-5) (Fig. 4, C and D). Next, when cholesterol was measured in these fractions, more than 85% of cholesterol was detected in the fractions (fractions 3-5) (Fig. 4B). Therefore, it appears that the fractions (fractions 3-5) are lipid rafts, suggesting that monomers and oligomers of beta toxin are specifically located within lipid rafts in HL 60 cells. No oligomer of the toxin was detected when the toxin was incubated with HL 60 cells at 4 °C, or when the toxin was incubated with MDCK cells, an insensitive cell, under these conditions (data not shown).Fig. 4Sucrose density gradient analysis of 32P-BTD-bound HL 60 cells. A, HL 60 cells were incubated with 32P-BTD (500 ng/ml) in the medium at 37 °C for 15 (a), 30 (b), and 60 (c) min and then extracted with HBSS containing 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 30 min and sonicated. The extracts were brought to 40% sucrose and then loaded at the bottom of a centrifuge tube. After sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, 0.4-ml gradient fractions were collected from the top of the tubes. The aliquots of gradient fractions were dissolved in 2× SDS sample buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. B, distribution of cholesterol in the sucrose gradient fractions was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The aliquots of gradient fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After transfer, the blots were treated with anti-Lyn (C) or anti-caveolin-1 (D). Peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies bound to the membrane were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Effect of Methyl-β-cyclodextrin, Cholesterol Oxidase, and Nystatin on the Cytotoxicity of Beta Toxin—It has been reported (29Kilsdonk E.P.C.

https://openalex.org/W2072216679,"Photoreceptor cells adapt to bright or continuous light, although the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Here, we report a mechanism of light adaptation in Drosophila, which is regulated by phosphoinositides (PIs). We found that light-dependent translocation of arrestin was defective in mutants that disrupt PI metabolism or trafficking. Arrestin bound to PIP(3) in vitro, and mutation of this site delayed arrestin shuttling and resulted in defects in the termination of the light response, which is normally accelerated by prior exposure to light. Disruption of the arrestin/PI interaction also suppressed retinal degeneration caused by excessive endocytosis of rhodopsin/arrestin complexes. These findings indicate that light-dependent trafficking of arrestin is regulated by direct interaction with PIs and is required for light adaptation. Since phospholipase C activity is required for activation of Drosophila phototransduction, these data point to a dual role of PIs in phototransduction."
https://openalex.org/W2057667466,"A novel mechanism of regulation of cardiac α and β myosin heavy chain gene by naturally occurring antisense transcription was elucidated via pre-mRNA analysis. Herein, we report the expression of an antisense β myosin heavy chain RNA in the normal rodent myocardium. The pattern of expression of the antisense βMHC RNA (β RNA) under altered thyroid state and in diabetes directly correlates with that of the α pre-mRNA/mRNA, whereas it negatively correlates with the β mRNA expression. Rapid amplification of the 5′ end shows that this antisense transcript originates 2 kb downstream of the β gene, and it is transcribed across the entire β gene from the opposite strand. Our results demonstrate that the β-α myosin heavy chain intergenic DNA possesses a bidirectional transcriptional activity, one direction transcribing the α gene, and the opposite direction transcribing the antisense β RNA. This process turns on the α expression, and it simultaneously turns off that of the β and thus coordinates α and β expression in an opposite fashion. Comparative analyses of the intergenic DNA sequence across five mammalian species revealed a conserved region that is proposed to be a common regulatory region for the α and antisense β promoter. This finding unravels the mechanism of cardiac α-β gene switching and implicates the role of cardiac myosin gene organization with their function.

For example during the first 3 weeks of postnatal life of rodents there is a complete switch from a predominant βMHC expression at birth (>90%) to a predominant αMHC expression at 3 weeks of age (>95%). Throughout adult life, the αMHC expression predominates in a normal rodent heart, with βMHC expression gradually increasing as the animal gets older. At any time during life, the pattern of MHC expression can be altered. Hypothyroidism and diabetes are associated with a switch in the cardiac MHC gene expression from a predominant αMHC to a predominant βMHC. In contrast, thyroid hormones treatment increases the αMHC expression while down-regulating the βMHC expression. The exact molecular mechanisms causing this tightly coordinated regulation of these two genes remains unclear. Thyroid hormone has been shown to be a major regulator of MHC gene expression, and its regulation is thought to occur mainly via transcriptional processes regulating each gene independently in a well coordinated fashion (8Izumo S. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Science. 1986; 231: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Several thyroid responsive elements have been located on the promoter of the αMHC gene, whereas the localized action of thyroid hormone on the βMHC promoter remains poorly defined (10Wright C.E. Haddad F. Qin A.X. Bodell P.W. Baldwin K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C883-C891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to further characterize the mode of regulation of cardiac MHC expression in response to hypothyroidism and to diabetes, we first examined the MHC primary transcript expression in the myocardium under control, as well as in the diabetic and hypothyroid states, in which both states are associated with a rapid shift from predominant αMHC to predominant βMHC mRNA and protein expression. Changes in the primary transcript level can be used as an indicative measure of changes in transcriptional activity of a gene (11Elferink C.J. Reiners Jr., J.J. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12O'Sullivan D.C. Szestak T.A.M. Pell J.M. Am. J.

Primary transcript expression was determined by RT-PCR techniques using random primers for the reverse transcription reaction and intronic primers for the PCR. Using intronic primers ensure targeting only nascent primary transcripts as opposed to processed mature mRNA. Thus we used this approach to monitor primary transcripts expression and correlate these with the corresponding MHC mRNA expression. Our results 2Unpublished observations. showed that the pattern of αMHC mRNA expression directly correlates with its nascent pre-mRNA and agrees with the concept that this gene is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to altered thyroid state and in diabetes. In contrast, the βMHC pre-mRNA expression pattern and its relationship to the mRNA were paradoxical. For example, in the hypothyroid heart, the βMHC mRNA increased significantly severalfold whereas the βMHC pre-mRNA did not change. Also, diabetic heart RNA analyses showed that although the βMHC mRNA increased severalfold, the β pre-mRNA levels actually were decreased. These results triggered us to design primers specific to the strands in question. Using random primers for cDNA synthesis can target all RNA populations and may not be specific to the sense strand in question. When RT primers are designed to specifically target either the sense or the antisense primary transcript, then the coupled PCR will amplify only the products of a specific strand. When this approach was followed, it was found that the normal rodent heart expresses both sense and antisense βMHC transcript, and the effect of thyroid hormones and diabetes is more pronounced on the antisense regulation. This antisense regulation is directly linked to the regulation of the mature βMHC mRNA transcript accumulation. Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to characterize the antisense βMHC RNA (AS β RNA) and determine its potential significance in the mammalian hearts. Animal Model—Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (≈150–180-g body weight) were used for all experiments. Hypothyroidism was induced using daily propylthiouracil (PTU) treatment via intraperitoneal injections at a dose of 12 mg/kg body weight (10Wright C.E. Haddad F. Qin A.X. Bodell P.W. Baldwin K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C883-C891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas diabetes was induced with a single streptozotocin IV injection at 75–100 mg/kg (14Haddad F. Bodell P.W. McCue S.A. Baldwin K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E856-E863PubMed Google Scholar). This study followed the NIH Animal Care Guidelines and was approved by the University of California, Irvine Animal Care and Use Committee. RNA Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from frozen myocardial tissue using the Trireagent protocol (Molecular Research Center). Extracted RNA was DNase-treated using 1 unit of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) per μg of total RNA and was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by a second extraction using Trireagent LS. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using specific primers (Table I). After reverse transcription, PCR was carried out with specific PCR primers targeting either the pre-mRNA or mRNA (Table II). The cDNA dilutions were in the order of 1 to 5 for all pre-mRNA amplifications, and these were run for 29 cycles. For mRNA amplification, cDNA was diluted 50-fold, and PCR was carried out for 24 cycles. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The ultraviolet light-induced fluorescence of stained DNA was captured on a photographic film, and band intensities were quantified using scanning densitometry and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).Table ISequence of primers used for RT and PCRPrimer nameSequence form 5′ to 3′MHC RNA target in RThr all saPrimer used for specific RT reactions; h, human specific; r, rat specific; hr, human and rat common; s, sense; as, antisense.

Open table in a new tab Amplification of the β-αMHC Intergenic DNA by PCR—To elucidate the origin of the antisense RNA, we needed some sequence information on the 3′ flanking region of the βMHC gene. The intergenic DNA between α and βMHC gene was amplified from rat genomic DNA by high fidelity PCR (Pfu Ultra; Stratagene) using β I39 for the forward primer and +420 α for the reverse primer. The β I39 sequence is from the last intron of the βMHC gene (Table I). The +420 α is complementary to 20 bp from the αMHC gene extending from +400 to +420 relative to the αMHC TSS. The PCR resulted in a ∼5-kb PCR fragment that was purified by gel electrophoresis and extraction (using the Qiagen gel extraction kit). This intergenic fragment was ligated into the multicloning site of a pGEM-T cloning vector (Promega) using the supplier's recommendation. After ligation, DH5α bacteria (Invitrogen) were transformed, and several clones containing the insert were obtained. The ∼5-kb intergenic insert was fully sequenced in six different clones using the BigDye Terminator mix (ABI) and an automatic ABI 3700 sequencer (University of California, Irvine DNA Core facility). Rapid Amplification of the cDNA 5′ Ends (5′ RACE)—Specific RT-PCR results indicate that the AS β RNA originates in the middle of the intergenic region between the α and βMHC genes. To characterize the 5′ end of the AS β RNA, we used the 5′ RACE system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). The RT primer sequence was 5′-CAGAATGGGTGAGGAGA-3′ (located at position 2239–2255 bp on the intergenic fragment GenBank™ accession number AY191158). The RT reaction was followed by two rounds of PCR using the nested gene-specific (GSP) reverse primers GSP-1, 5′-GATATGAGCGCCGGAACAGCAGAG-3′; and GSP-2, 5′-AGACGGGGGATCCAGGTAACAAAG-3′. The obtained PCR products were extracted from the gel (Qiagen) and directly sequenced using GSP-2 as the sequencing primer. DNA Injection in the Myocardium and Reporter Gene Assay—The reporter gene assay approach was used to test the antisense promoter activity in vivo. The entire β-α intergenic sequence was ligated in the antisense orientation upstream of the Renilla luciferase (R-Luc) coding domain of the pRL null vector (Promega). We tested the promoter activity in vivo using direct plasmid transfer via an intramuscular injection (15Acsadi G. Jiao S.S. Jani A. Duke D. Williams P. Chong W. Wolff J.A. New Biol. 1991; 3: 71-81PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA injection into the myocardium was performed via a subdiaphragmatic approach as described previously (16Wright C.E. Bodell P.W. Haddad F. Qin A.X. Baldwin K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1262-C1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Seven days post-plasmid injections, rats were euthanized, and tissue was processed as described previously (10Wright C.E. Haddad F. Qin A.X. Bodell P.W. Baldwin K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C883-C891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for reporter gene assays. The firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the dual luciferase kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's instruction. Reaction chemiluminescence was determined using an analytical luminometer (monolight 2010C). A myosin light chain 2 promoter fragment (a gift from Dr. Karyn Esser, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL) that is constitutively active in cardiac myocytes was used to correct for transfection efficiency. myosin light chain 2 drives the expression of firefly luciferase in pGL3 vector (17Esser K. Nelson T. Lupa-Kimball V. Blough E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and was co-injected with the test promoter in equimolar amounts. Cardiac MHC RNA Expression in Hypothyroid State and in Diabetes—Analyses of the rat cardiac MHC RNA species under normal control, hypothyroidism, and diabetes demonstrate the following observations. 1) In the normal control ventricle, simultaneous expression of the AS β RNA, the sense β pre-mRNA (S β pre-mRNA), and the sense α pre-mRNA (S α pre-mRNA) is observed (Fig. 1A). In these same control ventricles, α mRNA is almost exclusively expressed (Fig. 1A), with only small amounts (<5%) of β mRNA that can be detected. 2) Hypothyroidism (PTU treatment) and diabetes (D) are associated with an increased expression of the S β pre-mRNA and a dramatically decreased expression of both the AS β RNA and S α pre-mRNAs. These are associated with a shift from α to β predominance at the mature mRNA level (Fig. 1A). 3) Under the above conditions only trace levels of antisense α RNA can be detected (Fig. 1A). The observed shifts in β mRNA under hypothyroid and diabetic states far exceed those in the S β pre-mRNA (Fig. 1B) and thus cannot be explained by changes in the β gene sense transcription alone. Rather, these findings suggest that cardiac βMHC gene expression is subjected to complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes impacting its expression at the mRNA level. In contrast, α mRNA shifts corresponded well to changes in the S α pre-mRNA levels thus supporting a classical transcriptional regulation of this gene. Analyses of the relationships between pre-mRNA species and mRNA products demonstrate a strong direct correlation between AS β RNA and S α pre-mRNA (Fig. 1C), whereas a significant inverse correlation was observed between the AS β RNA levels and the expressed β mRNA (Fig. 1D). These relationships suggest a direct co-regulation of transcription of sense α and antisense β via a common promoter region located between the sense α and the antisense β basal promoters on the β-α intergenic segment and that the AS β RNA inhibits the processing of the S β pre-mRNA into mature mRNA. This novel regulatory mechanism thus provides a working model (shown in Fig. 2), which can be used to explain the remarkable malleability in cardiac MHC gene expression thereby providing efficient antithetical regulation of the two cardiac genes during development and under altered hormonal status.Fig. 2Schematic of cardiac MHC gene locus. Cardiac MHC genes are located on the same chromosome. Each gene is ∼25 kb, and they are separated by 4 kb. βP is the basal promoter of the βMHC gene transcribing the sense βMHC pre-mRNA. αP is the basal promoter of the αMHC gene transcribing the sense αMHC pre-mRNA. AS βP is an intergenic promoter transcribing the antisense β RNA, which is proposed to inhibit the processing of the sense β pre-mRNA into mature β mRNA. We propose that both sense α and antisense β transcriptions are regulated by a common promoter region (CPR).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Isolation of the Rat Cardiac β-αMHC Intergenic Region and Sequence Analyses—Based on the above findings highlighting the role of the intergenic sequence in regulating the β and αMHC gene locus, our goal was to isolate and characterize the intergenic DNA in terms of full sequence and bidirectional transcriptional activity. A 5-kb DNA fragment, corresponding to the full-length β-αMHC intergenic fragment, was amplified from rat genomic DNA by high fidelity PCR and was fully sequenced. To gain insight on regulatory regions, the entire intergenic sequence was subjected to phylogenetic footprinting analysis, which is a powerful computational method to identify high probability DNA regulatory sites corresponding to well conserved regions in orthologous gene promoters (18Blanchette M. Tompa M. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 19Wasserman W.W. Fickett J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Analyses of the rat sequence against the cardiac MHC intergenic sequences from four other mammalian species (extracted from the GenBank™ via Blast searches) show that regulatory elements are clustered mainly in two domains, a proximal module consisting of the already characterized α promoter (20Molkentin J.D. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1211-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and a distal module located between 1.2 and 1.6 kb relative to α TSS (Fig. 3). This distal module could represent the proximal regulatory region of the antisense promoter. These regulatory domains correspond to high percent sequence identity across the five species (Fig. 3A). The close physical proximity between the AS β promoter and the αMHC promoter places them in an ideal strategic location to be tightly co-regulated via a common promoter region (CPR in Fig. 2A). Antisense Promoter Activity in Hypothyroid Hearts—To test the function of the antisense transcriptional activity of the intergenic fragment, the entire 5-kb intergenic fragment was ligated into the multicloning site of the pRL null vector (Promega) in the antisense direction in front of the Renilla luciferase gene (Fig. 4A). This construct was tested for activity in driving reporter expression in the intact rat myocardium using a direct gene transfer approach. It was found that under normal condition, the antisense intergenic fragment drives expression to a level of 300% that of a promoterless vector. This expression was significantly reduced by 85% under the hypothyroid state (Fig. 4B). The responsiveness to PTU of this antisense transcriptional activity mimics the response that is found in vivo based on pre-mRNA analysis (Fig. 1A). Where Does This Antisense RNA Originate from, and How Far Does It Extend Relative to the βMHC Gene?—To map the 5′ end of AS β RNA, 5′ RACE (Invitrogen) was performed. Sequencing of the 5′ RACE products found two transcription start sites at positions 2,195 and 2,158 bp upstream from the TSS of the αMHC gene. Reverse transcription using a primer from the first intron of the βMHC gene in the sense orientation, followed by PCR using intergenic primers targeting the cDNA corresponding to an intergenic region located at position –2753 to –2218 bp from the αMHC gene TSS was successful in amplifying a cDNA product that was responsive to thyroid state (Fig. 4C). In contrast, using PCR primers targeting a position from –2183 to –1897 relative to the αMHC TSS did not amplify a cDNA product from either control or PTU hearts. Both primer sets amplified a product when the 5-kb AS IG pRL plasmid DNA was used as a template (Fig 4C). These findings provide evidence that the AS β RNA originates in the intergenic region between the α and βMHC genes and extends across the full-length βMHC gene. Evidence That the Intergenic Bidirectional Promoter Is Active in the Human Heart—If the bidirectional α-β intergenic promoter is conserved across species (as predicted based on Fig. 3), one should be able to demonstrate its activity in the human heart. The intergenic promoter activity can be probed via analysis of the AS β RNA. Three separate batches of human heart total RNA (Stratagene) were analyzed for the expression of α and β mRNA, S pre-mRNA, and AS RNA. RT-PCR analyses of the various MHC RNA species are consistent with previous findings that normal human heart expresses predominantly the βMHC isoform (21Nakao K. Minobe W. Roden R. Bristow M.R. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2362-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 22Reiser P.J. Portman M.A. Ning X.-H. Moravec C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1814-H1820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that although the β mRNA/pre-mRNA is predominant in human ventricles, the α mRNA/pre-mRNA can also be detected (Fig. 5). Furthermore, using specific RT-PCR, we were able to detect the AS β RNA (Fig. 5B, lane 5). Thus, this regulatory mechanism is functional in human hearts and may contribute to pathologically associated shifts in cardiac MHC composition that can lead to altered cardiac function (21Nakao K.

It is relevant to note that the existence of an antisense cardiac βMHC RNA has been reported previously, but it was neither well characterized nor linked to a particular function such as coordinating the cardiac MHC antithetical shifts. In nuclear run-on assays aimed to study transcriptional activity of cardiac MHC genes in the rat heart, Boheler et al. (32Boheler K.R. Chassagne C. Martin X. Wisnewsky C. Schwartz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12979-12985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported a strong transcription signal in normal hearts when using a sense βMHC gene probe consisting of the third exon and some parts of flanking intron 2 and intron 3 sequences. To our knowledge, they have not studied the expression of this transcript under altered MHC expression. Furthermore, this report of the antisense expression has not linked its expression with a functional significance. More recently, Luther et al. (33Luther H.P. Morwinski R. Wallukat G. Haase H.

Furthermore, once the endothelial cells are denuded, GPIb (CD42b) on platelet surface binds to immobilized von Willebrand factor (vWF) 1The abbreviations used are: vWF, von Willebrand factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; NK, natural killer; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FP, fusion protein; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay. at exposed subendothelium (4Ikeda Y.

Blood. 1999; 93: 3831-3838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have also been reported to be involved in this process, depending on both shear rate and activation status of platelets and endothelial cells. Recently, Harlan and colleagues (7Bombeli T. Schwarz B.R. Harlan J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) proposed a model for the interaction between activated platelets and intact endothelial cells, in which platelet-bound adhesive proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vWF mediate bridging between human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and GPIIbIIIa (CD41/CD61) expressed on platelets. However, in their experimental model, adhesion of activated platelets to intact HUVEC was only partially inhibited in the presence of Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptide, which blocks ligand binding to GPIIbIIIa (7Bombeli T. Schwarz B.R. Harlan J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), suggesting that there might be as yet undetermined adhesion molecules contributing to this interaction. The hemostatic system is also maintained by the constant production of platelets from megakaryocytes. Platelets are assumed to be cell fragments torn from cytoplasm of mature megakaryocytes that reside in close proximity to bone marrow endothelial cells (11Kaufman R.M. Airo R. Pollack S. Crosby W.H.

Several lines of evidence suggest that cellular interaction between megakaryocytes and vascular endothelial cells plays a crucial role for megakaryopoiesis (14Eldor A. Fuks Z. Levine R.F.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying this cellular interaction has not been well elucidated before now. We previously identified a novel adhesion molecule DNAM-1 (CD226), which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily containing two Ig-like domains of the V-set and is encoded by a gene on human chromosome 18q22.3 (19Shibuya A. Campbell D. Hannum C. Yssel H. Franz-Bacon K. McClanahan T. Kitamura T. Nicholl J. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1996; 4: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). CD226 is a ∼65-kDa glycoprotein expressed on the majority of NK cells and monocytes and a subset of T-lymphocytes, and involved in cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion mediated by NK cells and T-lymphocytes. It is intriguing that CD226 is also expressed on platelets (20Lanier, L. L., Shibuya, A., and Burns, G. (2000) Protein Reviews on the Web, 1:68–71 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PROW/guide/2119937103_g.htm)Google Scholar). Cross-linking CD226 with an anti-CD226 monoclonal antibody induces platelet activation and aggregation (21Scott J.L. Dunn S.M. Jin B. Hillam A.J. Walton S. Berndt M.C. Murray A.W. Krissansen G.W.

We demonstrate here that CD226 is involved in adhesion of platelets and megakaryocytic cells to vascular endothelial cells. Antibodies—Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-CD226 mAb DX11 was provided by DNAX Research Institute (Palo Alto, CA), and its F(ab′)2 fragments were prepared as described (19Shibuya A. Campbell D. Hannum C. Yssel H. Franz-Bacon K.

Cell Lines and Cell Preparation—HEL, BW5147, COS-7, and 293T cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). UT7/TPO and CMK are megakaryocytic cell lines provided by Dr. Norio Komatsu (Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan) (22Komatsu N. Kunitama M. Yamada M. Hagiwara T. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Eguchi M.

NH is an erythroleukemic cell line established in our laboratory. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and gel-filtrated platelets were prepared as described elsewhere (24Hamazaki Y. Kojima H. Mano H.

Haemost. 1995; 74: 1541-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). HUVEC were prepared by the standard procedure. Briefly, inner lumen of the umbilical vein was gently washed with sterile PBS and filled with trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, detached cells were harvested and washed once with RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 15% horse serum, 6 units/ml heparin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm Hepes, and 1× endothelial cell growth factor (Sigma), transferred to gelatin (Sigma)-coated flasks, and then cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Establishment of BW5147 Transfectants Expressing Mutant CD226 —BW5147 transfectants expressing wild type and a site-specific CD226 mutant at serine residue 329 were described previously (26Shibuya A. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1671-1676PubMed Google Scholar). To generate site-specific CD226 mutants at tyrosine residues 322, 325, or both, antisense PCR primers, which contained a codon for Phe322 (TTT), Phe325 (TTT), or both, were designed. The PCR products were subcloned into a retroviral vector pMX-neo (provided by Dr. Toshio Kitamura, DNAX Research Institute) with cloning sites of BamHI (5′) and NotI (3′). BOSC23 packaging cells were transfected with the CD226 cDNA in the retroviral vector using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described previously (27Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A.

Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). BW5147 cells were infected with the CD226 retrovirus stock. Two days after infection, the cells expressing CD226 were cloned by flow cytometry. All mutant cDNAs were verified by sequencing. Expression of the CD226-Ig Fusion Protein (FP) and Flow Cytometry—293T cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid of the CD226-Ig FP, which was constructed in pCDM8 expression vector containing a human CD8 leader segment followed by the Fc segment of human IgG at the COOH terminus (provided by Dr. Gerald Zurawski, DNAX Research Institute), and the CD226-Ig FP was purified by affinity chromatography using immobilized protein A (Bio-Rad). Cells (2 × 105) were stained for 1 h on ice with 1 μg/ml CD226-Ig FP or control FP. FITC-labeled anti-human IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was used as a second step reagent. Flow cytometry was performed to detect the binding of CD226-Ig FP to HUVEC. Adhesion Assay of Calcein-loaded Platelets—Platelet adhesion to HUVEC was determined by the method, as described (7Bombeli T. Schwarz B.R. Harlan J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), with modification. Briefly, PRP was treated with 1 mm aspirin for 20 min, and after adding 0.1 volume of ACD solution (2.2% (w/v) sodium citrate, 0.8% (w/v) citric acid, and 2.2% (w/v) dextrose), the PRP was centrifuged at 500 × g for 20 min at room temperature. Platelets were resuspended in 200 μl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 10% ACD, and 0.5 μl of 5 mm calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to the platelet suspension. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature in the dark with gentle shaking, platelets were washed twice with Hepes-Tyrode buffer containing 10% ACD and were resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode buffer (1 × 109/ml). Platelets were stimulated or not with thrombin (1 unit/ml, for 10 min at room temperature) under non-stirring condition, and then hirudin (2 units/ml, Sigma) was added to inactivate thrombin. After additional treatment with F(ab′)2 fragments of control Ig (Jackson Co., West Grove, PA) or anti-CD226 mAb alone or in combination with Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptide (500 μm, Sigma) at room temperature for 10 min, 100 μl of calcein-loaded platelets were transferred on HUVEC prepared in each well of 12-well microtiter plates (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan) containing 900 μl of RPMI 1640 with 1 mm CaCl2. Platelets were co-cultured with HUVEC for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing out the non-adherent platelets, HUVEC were detached by cell scraper, vigorously pipetted, and washed once. The platelet binding to HUVEC was detected by flow cytometry in triplicate experiments. Adhesion Assays of Various Cell Lines—Various cell lines were labeled with Na251CrO4 (37 MBq/ml) (New England Nucleus, Boston, MA) and resuspended in RPMI 1640 (2 × 105/ml). 51Cr-Labeled cells were treated with various concentrations of F(ab′)2 fragments of control Ig or anti-CD226 mAb at room temperature for 10 min, if required. One hundred microliters of 51Cr-labeled cells were then transferred into each well of 48-well microtiter plates, in which HUVEC or COS-7 cells had been plated at least 48 h prior to assay. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, non-adherent cells were removed by washing with RPMI 1640. Residual adherent cells were treated with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and the radioactivities in the lysates were determined by a γ-counter. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Gel-filtrated platelets (5–10 × 108 cells/sample) in Hepes-Tyrode buffer after various stimulations were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 158 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 2 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). For platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, 100-mm non-treated polystyrene dishes (Iwaki) were coated with 200 μg/ml fibrinogen (fraction I; Sigma) for 16 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and blocked with 1 mg/ml BSA for 1 h. Gel-filtrated platelets (3 ml, 4 × 108/ml) pretreated with apyrase (10 units/ml, Sigma) were placed on fibrinogen-coated dishes for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washings with PBS, adherent platelets were lysed by 1 ml of RIPA buffer. Non-adherent platelets harvested from BSA-coated dishes were used as a negative control. Lysates were precleared with Protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) in RIPA buffer at 4 °C for 1 h and reacted with anti-CD226 mAb at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with Protein G-Sepharose CL-4B, washed three times with RIPA buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybound™ ECL™; Amersham Biosciences). After overnight incubation in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% BSA, membranes were reacted with a specific antibody. Proteins were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Biosciences) and developed by ECL-immunoblotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence was detected by autoradiography. Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Bone marrow smears prepared from healthy volunteers were incubated with 5% horse serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then stained with anti-CD226 mAb for 2 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, followed by staining with 1:2000 diluted Alexa 488-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. After washings with PBS, slides were fixed with Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and observed under fluorescent microscopy. HUVEC Express the Putative Ligand for CD226 (CD226L)— To determine the role of CD226 in platelet adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, we first examined whether vascular endothelial cells express CD226L. We generated a soluble protein consisting of the extracellular domain of CD226 fused to the Fc portion of human IgG. The fusion protein of CD226 specifically bound to HUVEC, indicating that HUVEC express the putative CD226L (Fig. 1A). To examine whether the CD226L expressed on HUVEC mediate intercellular binding, we co-cultured 51Cr-labeled BW5147 transfectants expressing CD226 with HUVEC monolayers and determined specific intercellular binding. As shown in Fig. 1B, the BW5147 transfectants expressing CD226 bound HUVEC at significantly higher levels than the parental BW5147 cells. Moreover, the binding of the transfectants to HUVEC was specifically inhibited in the presence of F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-CD226 mAb. These results indicate that HUVEC express the functional CD226L that mediates intercellular binding. CD226 Mediates Thrombin-activated Platelet Binding to HUVEC—To explore the involvement of CD226 in platelet binding to vascular endothelial cells, HUVEC monolayers were incubated with calcein-loaded platelets. HUVEC were then harvested, and platelet binding was determined by flow cytometry. Whereas the binding of resting platelets to HUVEC was hardly detected (data not shown), thrombin-activated platelets effectively bound to HUVEC (Fig. 2). Pretreatment of thrombin-activated platelets with RGDS peptide, which blocks ligand binding to GPIIbIIIa, inhibited the platelet binding to HUVEC, consistent with a previous report (7Bombeli T. Schwarz B.R. Harlan J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, we observed that blockade of CD226 by F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-CD226 mAb alone also significantly inhibited the thrombin-activated platelet binding to HUVEC induced by thrombin. Combination of F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-CD226 mAb and RGDS peptide further inhibited platelet binding to HUVEC. These results indicate that CD226 is involved in thrombin-activated platelet adhesion to HUVEC. Thrombin Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of CD226 in Platelets—Because platelet activation with thrombin induces CD226-mediated adhesion of platelets to HUVEC, we considered that thrombin may either up-regulate CD226 expression or modulate CD226 function on platelets. As the amount of platelet-surface CD226 did not change, as determined by flow cytometry, after stimulation with thrombin (data not shown), we supposed that platelet activation with thrombin modulates the avidity or affinity of CD226 molecule. We therefore investigated whether platelet activation by natural agonist such as thrombin or collagen induces signaling events in CD226. Because CD226 cytoplasmic portion contains the tyrosine at residue 322, which can be phosphorylated by the Fyn tyrosine kinase (29Shibuya K. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Ochs H.D. Shimizu K. Nakayama E. Nakauchi H. Shibuya A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we examined whether thrombin or collagen induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 (A and B), stimulation of platelets with collagen or thrombin under stirring condition induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226. In a sharp contrast to the rapid phosphorylation by collagen that peaked at 1 min, tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226 by thrombin was achieved at the maximum level after 10 min. Judging from the slower time course of the phosphorylation in thrombin-stimulated platelets, we assumed that the phosphorylation is mediated mainly by fibrinogen binding to GPIIbIIIa and/or the resultant platelet aggregation. To explore this possibility, we examined whether thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226 is observed under non-stirring condition, in which fibrinogen binding to GPIIbIIIa is reduced. As demonstrated in Fig. 3C, although platelet stimulation with thrombin under non-stirring condition induced significant level of tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226, the phosphorylation level was considerably lower than that induced under stirring condition. Moreover, addition of RGDS peptide, which blocks fibrinogen binding to GPIIbIIIa, significantly inhibited thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226. These results suggest that fibrinogen binding to GPIIbIIIa is critical for achieving the maximal level of tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226 in thrombin-activated platelets. In fact, platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen via GPIIbIIIa resulted in significant levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226 (Fig. 3D). The Tyrosine (Tyr322) Is Involved in CD226-mediated Adhesion—We previously reported that phosphorylation of the serine at residue 329 by PKC plays an important role for CD226-mediated adhesion (26Shibuya A. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1671-1676PubMed Google Scholar). However, we also observed that the site-specific mutant CD226 at residue 329 (Ser329 → Phe) is still capable of binding to the putative CD226L (data not shown and Ref. 26Shibuya A. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1671-1676PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CD226-mediated adhesion depends in part on undetermined molecular events other than the phosphorylation of Ser329. Here we have demonstrated that thrombin induces both CD226-mediated platelet adhesion to HUVEC and tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226 may also be involved in CD226-mediated adhesion. To examine this possibility, we established BW5147 transfectants expressing either wild type or site-directed mutant CD226 at residues 322, 325, or both (Tyr322 → Phe, Tyr325 → Phe, or Tyr322 → Phe/Tyr325 → Phe, respectively). As shown in Fig. 4B, the introduction of the site-directed mutations at residues 322 (Tyr322 → Phe) and both 322 and 325 (Tyr322 → Phe/Tyr325 → Phe), but not at 325 alone (Tyr325 → Phe), completely abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226 after stimulation with pervanadate, suggesting that Tyr322 as well as Ser329 may play an important role for CD226-mediated adhesion. For binding assay, we used COS-7 cells, instead of HUVEC, which also express the putative CD226L, as confirmed by flow cytometry using the CD226-Ig fusion protein (data not shown), because COS-7 cells are hardly detached from plates by vigorous washing to extremely reduce nonspecific binding of 51Cr-labeled BW5147 transfectants. Whereas these transfectants express comparable amount of CD226 (Fig. 4A), the transfectants expressing mutated CD226 at residue(s) 322 (Tyr322 → Phe) or both 322 and 325 (Tyr322 → Phe/Tyr325 → Phe), but not 325 alone (Tyr325 → Phe), bound to COS-7 cells at a significantly lower level, as compared with that expressing wild type CD226 (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226 at residue 322 plays an important role for CD226-mediated adhesion of the transfectant to COS-7. CD226 Mediates Binding of Megakaryocytic Cells to HUVEC—We examined the expression of CD226 on megakaryocytes or megakaryocytic cell lines. Fig. 5A shows that human primary megakaryocytes express significant amount of CD226, as determined by immunohistochemistry. Analyses by flow cytometry and immunoblotting showed that CD226 is also expressed on various megakaryocytic cell lines, including UT7/TPO, CMK, and HEL, but not on an erythroleukemic cell line, NH (Fig. 5, B and C). Therefore, experiments were undertaken to examine whether CD226 is involved in interaction between megakaryocytes and vascular endothelial cells. HUVEC monolayers were incubated with 51Cr-labeled HEL cells in the presence or absence of anti-CD226 mAb, and specific binding of HEL cells to HUVEC was determined. As shown in Fig. 6, HEL cell binding to HUVEC was significantly inhibited in the presence of F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-CD226 mAb, indicating that CD226 participates in HEL cell binding to HUVEC. Similar results were observed when UT7/TPO or CMK cells were cultured with HUVEC (data not shown). These results indicate that CD226 is involved in interaction between megakaryocytic cells and vascular endothelial cells.Fig. 6CD226 mediates adhesion of megakaryocytic cells to HUVEC. 51Cr-Labeled HEL cells were treated or not with F(ab′)2 fragments of control Ig (Cont.) or anti-CD226 mAb at room temperature for 10 min, and then incubated on HUVEC prepared in 48-well microtiter plates at 37 °C for 1 h. The adherent HEL cells were lysed, and the radioactivities in the lysates were assayed by a γ-counter. Results are presented as the mean radioactivities in triplicate experiments. Error bars denote standard deviations (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01). The data are representative of several independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the present study we have found that the putative ligand for CD226 is expressed on HUVEC (Fig. 1). This observation led us to examine whether CD226 mediates intercellular binding between platelets and HUVEC. We have demonstrated that thrombin-activated, but not resting, platelets bind to HUVEC, and CD226 is in part responsible for this binding (Fig. 2). We have also shown that platelet activation with thrombin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226 (Fig. 3B) as well as CD226-mediated adhesion. Significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226 for its adhesive function was demonstrated at least in CD226-expressing BW5147 transfectants (Fig. 4). Taken together with these and our previous observations (26Shibuya A. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1671-1676PubMed Google Scholar, 29Shibuya K. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Ochs H.D. Shimizu K. Nakayama E. Nakauchi H. Shibuya A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), it may be feasible to consider that thrombin modulates CD226 adhesive function possibly via CD226 tyrosine phosphorylation, which enables CD226-mediated platelet adhesion to HUVEC. Although we have demonstrated that the tyrosine phosphorylation at residue 322 of CD226 is in part responsible for CD266-mediated adhesion in BW5147 transfectant system (Fig. 4), it remains undetermined whether the tyrosine phosphorylation is involved also in thrombin-induced platelet adhesion to HUVEC. Indeed, thrombin gave rise to CD226-mediated platelet adhesion to HUVEC under non-stirring condition (Fig. 2), in which CD226 was only weakly tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3C). One possible explanation is that, besides tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226, other signaling events induced by thrombin co-operatively modulate CD226 adhesive function. In fact, in our previous experiment, we demonstrated that serine phosphorylation of CD226 is critical for its adhesive function in T-lymphocytes (26Shibuya A. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1671-1676PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, a small amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226 may be sufficient to exert its adhesive function. Fibrinogen binding to GPIIbIIIa, which should be induced by platelet activation by thrombin, seems to play an important role for thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD226 (Fig. 3, C and D). We previously demonstrated that cross-linking CD226 on NK cells derived from a patient with leukocyte adhesion molecule deficiency, whose leukocytes lack LFA-1 expression, fails to induce NK cell activation (29Shibuya K.

Furthermore, CD226 is associated with LFA-1 in NK cells and activated T-lymphocytes (29Shibuya K. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Ochs H.D. Shimizu K. Nakayama E. Nakauchi H. Shibuya A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), indicating physical and functional relationship between CD226 and LFA-1. Presently, the signaling pathway leading to CD226 tyrosine phosphorylation in thrombin-activated platelets is uncertain. However, the requirement of ligand binding to GPIIbIIIa for the tyrosine phosphorylation in thrombin-activated platelets may indicate functional association between GPIIbIIIa and CD226, corresponding with the association of LFA-1 and CD226 in lymphocytes. On the other hand, the rapid time course of the tyrosine phosphorylation in collagen-stimulated platelets suggests a possibility that an Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn, which is rapidly activated by collagen in platelets (30Ezumi Y. Shindoh K. Tsuji M. Takayama H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), may phosphorylate the tyrosine at residue 322 of CD226, as was demonstrated in lymphocytes (29Shibuya K. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H.

We have described here that human primary megakaryocytes and several megakaryocytic cell lines express significant amount of CD226, which is involved in intercellular binding between megakaryocytic cell lines and HUVEC. Because cross-linking CD226 induces platelet activation and aggregation (20Lanier, L. L., Shibuya, A., and Burns, G. (2000) Protein Reviews on the Web, 1:68–71 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PROW/guide/2119937103_g.htm)Google Scholar),2 CD226 may mediate signals for cytoplasmic processing in megakaryocytes, possibly contributing to megakaryocyte maturation and/or platelet production. In summary, we have revealed a novel mechanism for adhesion of platelets and megakaryocytic cells to vascular endothelial cells. The present studies suggest that CD226 may play an important role for thrombosis and hemostasis. Further studies are under way to identify the CD226L and determine the structural requirements involved in CD226 binding. Activation mechanisms of CD226 during platelet activation by natural agonists should also be clarified in future experiments. We thank Dr. Lewis Lanier for critical reading of this manuscript.

Although amelogenins are also implicated in cementogenesis, their precise spatial expression pattern and molecular role are not clearly understood. Here, we report for the first time the expression of two alternate splice forms of amelogenins, M180 and the leucine-rich amelogenin peptide (LRAP), in the periodontal region of mouse tooth roots. Lack of M180 and LRAP mRNA expression correlated with cementum defects observed in the amelogenin-null mice. The cementum defects were characterized by an increased presence of multinucleated cells, osteoclasts, and cementicles. These defects were associated with an increased expression of the receptor activator of the nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), a critical regulator of osteoclastogenesis.

Ameloblasts synthesize and secrete amelogenins into the dental enamel matrix that undergo systematic proteolysis during enamel mineralization.

The targeted disruption of the amelogenin gene locus in mice also showed a hypoplastic enamel phenotype similar to amelogenesis imperfecta, confirming an important role of amelogenins in enamel formation (6Gibson C.W.

During cementogenesis, Hertwig's epithelial root sheath dissociates to form cell aggregates (epithelial rests of Malassez) that are located between the alveolar bone and the tooth root. The mesenchyme-derived cementoblasts secrete cementum matrix onto the root surface to form cementum. The presence of amelogenins was detected on the tooth root surface close to the site of acellular cementum (9Hamamoto Y. Nakajima T. Ozawa H. Uchida T. Oral Surg. Oral. Med. Oral Pathol. Oral Radiol.

However, it is not clear from these studies whether the amelogenin or non-amelogenin components of an enamel matrix derivative regulate regeneration of cementum and periodontal tissues.The present study was undertaken to investigate the expression of various alternate splice forms of amelogenins in tooth roots and correlate their expression with the cementum defects observed in amelogenin-null mice teeth. Herein, we report the expression of two mRNA splice forms of amelogenin, M180 and LRAP, in cementoblast (CM)/PDL cells of wild-type mice. Interestingly, a progressive deterioration of cementum was observed in the amelogenin-null mice, suggesting a possible function for the specific amelogenin splice forms. These defects were also associated with an increased receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) expression near the cementum, suggesting that the amelogenins may play a key role in the maintenance of cementum through the RANKL/RANK-mediated osteoclastogenic pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAmelogenin-null Mice—Amelogenin-null mice were generated by gene targeting (6Gibson C.W.

Standard National Institutes of Health guidelines were followed to monitor the health status of the mice and for housing and breeding practices.Preparation of Tissue Sections—Amelogenin-null mice and wild-type controls 1-day-, 6-month-, and 1-year-old were used for the present study. Eight mice in each group were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. After dissection, the skulls were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, decalcified in 10% EDTA and 0.01 m PBS (pH 7.4) for 4–6 weeks at 4 °C, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned into coronal sections at 8-μm thickness. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard protocols. Frozen sections from EDTA-decalcified skulls of three mice in each group were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity with the leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (Sigma).Immunohistochemistry—Frozen sections from the wild-type and amelogenin-null skulls were immunostained for RANKL using goat polyclonal antibodies against mouse RANKL (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) overnight at 4 °C at a dilution of 1:100. After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated mouse antibodies against goat IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). To visualize the immunoreactant, the sections were treated with diaminobenzidine substrate and counterstained with hematoxylin for light microscopy.Quantitative Micrograph Analysis—Light micrographs of the sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin were used for the histomorphometric measurements. Twenty slides, each with three sections of the first two mandibular molars from each mouse, were used for counting defects in cementum and dentin (e.g. multinuclear cells and cementicle numbers). Each number on the histogram represents the mean ± S.D. of observations from either the first or second mandibular molar from a total of four mice.Scanning Electron Microscopy Analysis of Molar Teeth—Molars from the wild-type and amelogenin-null mice were photographed using scanning electron microscopy at 20 kV (Jeol JSM T330A, Jeol, Inc., Peabody, MA).RNA Isolation and Gene Expression Analysis by RT-PCR—CM/PDL cell populations were established from cells lining the tooth root surface of 6-month-old wild-type and amelogenin-null mice. Mandibular first molars were extracted by dissecting the molars with adherent PDL from surrounding alveolar bone. The CM/PDL cells were isolated from the surface of the mandibular molars as described (18D'Errico J.A. MacNeil R.L. Takata T. Berry J. Strayhorn C. Somerman M.J.

Briefly, molars were placed in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube containing PBS with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) and 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Mandibular first molar tooth germs from 1 day-old wild-type and amelogenin-null mice were dissected from surrounding tissues. Total RNA was isolated using the RNA isolation kit (Stratagene) and treated with DNase. The RNA samples (1 μg each) were subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript™ first strand synthesis system for the RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primers as described in Table I. All PCR reactions were carried out in a PerkinElmer gene PCR system 600. PCR products were cloned into a T-vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and the nucleotide sequences were determined by cycle sequencing.Table IPrimers used for RT-PCR analysisSpecificityOligonucleotide sequence (5′-3′)ResiduesGenBank™ accession no.Product size (bp)Annealing temperatureCycle no.AmelogeninForwardAATGGGGACCTGGATTTTGTTTG59-81D31768—aProduct sizes of major bands are 601, 576, 496, 256, and 221 bp.64°C30ReverseTCCCGCTTGGTCTTGTCTGTCGCT614-637EnamelinForwardCATCCTTATTCCACTACATCCCCTG3115-3139NM0174685445826ReverseGGCGTGTTTTTTGGCTGAGAAG3638-3659RANKLForwardGGTCGGGCAATTCTGAATT957-976AF0537138125830ReverseGGGAATTACAAAGTGCACCAG1749-1769OPGForwardACCTCACCACAGAGCAGCTT1159-1178AB138982696026ReverseGTGCAGGAACCTCATGGTCT1409-1428TRAF 6ForwardGAGGAGATCCAGGGCTACGA410-429NM0094242925830ReverseATGTACTTGATGATCCTCGA702-721GAPDHbGAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.ForwardCCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG258-276XM1935323236026ReverseGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG562-581a Product sizes of major bands are 601, 576, 496, 256, and 221 bp.b GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Open table in a new tab RESULTSAmelogenins Are Expressed in CM/PDL Cells of Wild-type Mice—RT-PCR was performed using amelogenin exon 2- and exon 6-specific primers to identify the expression of mRNAs resulting from alternate splicing in the CM/PDL cells. Amelogenin transcripts were detected in the periodontal tissue (CM/PDL cells) from 6-month-old wild-type mice and tooth bud from 1-day-old wild-type mice (Fig. 1A). Six different amplified products of amelogenin mRNA were detected in tooth bud, whereas only two products were present in CM/PDL cells. All PCR products were cloned, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. The two amplified products (576 and 221 bp) that were detected in the CM/PDL cells contained exons 2, 3, 5, and 6 and exons 2, 3, 5, and partial 6, respectively (Fig 1B). These sequences were in agreement with the reported amelogenin splice forms (20Lau E.C. Simmer J.P. Bringas Jr., P. Hsu D.D. Hu C.C. Zeichner-David M. Thiemann F. Snead M.L. Slavkin H.C. Fincham A.G.

Enamelin, one of the enamel matrix proteins expressed in ameloblasts, was expressed in wild-type and the null tooth buds but not in the CM/PDL cell populations.Increased Cementum and Dentin Defects in Amelogenin-null Mice—The wild-type mice did not show any significant difference in the cementum thickness or abnormalities in the pulp and surrounding bone regions (Fig. 2A). However, the cementum of the null mice displayed resorptive lacunae at sites where periodontal ligaments attach to the cementum surface (Fig. 2, B and D). Multiple intrusive attachments of PDL extended through the cementum into the root dentin of the amelogenin-null mice. Furthermore, we examined the surface of the root cementum of the amelogenin-null mice by scanning electron microscopy. The molar root surface of the wild-type mice appeared smooth and without any gross indentations (Fig. 2E). However, the amelogenin-null mice displayed distinct indentations on the surface of the cementum (Fig. 2F). Unlike the wild-type tooth roots (Fig. 2G), the fractured sections of the amelogenin-null mouse tooth roots showed resorptive lacunae extending deep into the cementum (Fig. 2H).Fig. 2Cementum defects in the amelogenin-null mice.

As described under “Experimental Procedures,” 20 sagittal (serial) sections from three wild-type and three amelogenin-null mice, each at 6 months and 1 year of age, were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and counted for all resorptive lacunae. The first and second molars both showed a pattern of progressive increase in cementum defects (Fig. 3C). The amelogenin-null mice displayed four times more cementum defects at both 6 months and 1 year of age as compared with wild-type mice. Similarly, in the first and second molars, 13 times more root dentin defects were observed at both 6 months and 1 year of age as compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3D).Fig. 3Increased cementum and dentin defects in amelogenin-null mice.

The amelogenin-null mice displayed a 2-fold increase in number of the multinucleated cells as compared with wild-type mice at both 6 months and 1 year of age (Fig. 4E). Although the null mice had significantly more multinucleated cells than the wild-type mice, they did not show any progressive increase in number with age. Interestingly, these cells were stained positive for TRAP activity, indicative of their osteoclastic/odontoclastic nature (Fig. 4B), whereas wild-type mice did not display similar TRAP activity (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Increased number of osteoclasts/odontoclasts in amelogenin-null mice.

RT-PCR analysis revealed that RANKL and TRAF 6 mRNA levels were significantly elevated in CM/PDL cells of the null mice (Fig. 5A). However, the expression of OPG, an orphan receptor for RANKL, was not altered. The distribution of RANKL in the periodontal tissue of amelogenin-null mice was also examined by immunohistochemical analysis. RANKL immunoreactivity was not detected in the PDL cells of wild-type teeth (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the amelogenin-null PDL cells showed more intense staining for RANKL near the bone and cementum surface (Fig. 5C). These observations suggest that the abnormal localization of osteoclasts close to the tooth root correlates with the accelerated resorption of cementum in the amelogenin-null mice.Fig. 5Increased expression of osteoclastogenic pathway in the amelogenin-null mice. A, RT-PCR analysis showing increased levels of RANKL and its downstream molecule, TRAF 6, in CM/PDL cells of 6-month-old amelogenin-null (KO) mice as compared with wild-type (WT) mice.

The amelogenin-null mice displayed 2–4 times more cementicles near the molar tooth root at 6 and 12 months of age (Fig. 6C). The presence of cementicles is well documented in the periodontal spaces in pathological conditions as well as in aging humans. The increased presence of these cementicles confirms abnormal cementum in amelogenin-null mice.Fig. 6Increased number of cementicles in amelogenin-null mice.

The implied but undefined role of amelogenins in cementogenesis formed the basis of the present study. During tooth development, at least nine different mRNA splice forms are generated from the amelogenin gene as a result of alternate splicing (26Veis A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 38-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the presence of amelogenins in the tooth root region has been detected only by immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies (9Hamamoto Y. Nakajima T. Ozawa H. Uchida T.

Metab. 2001; 19: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, these studies could not identify the presence of individual alternate splice forms of mRNA or their translational products. Unlike unerupted molar teeth, the CM/PDL cells from the adult wild-type mice displayed expression of two specific mRNA splice forms (M180 and LRAP) of amelogenin. Expression of M180 and LRAP in CM/PDL indicate their potential role in cementum formation and perhaps in cementum maintenance.A detailed analysis of the amelogenin-null mice revealed normal cementogenesis but poor maintenance of the cementum, as observed by the increased presence of tooth root resorption. Dentin, cementum, and enamel of permanent teeth normally do not undergo resorption (28Gunraj M.N. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol. Oral Radiol. Endod. 1999; 88: 647-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Under certain clinical conditions such as chronic inflammation of the pulp and pulp necrosis (29Borum M.K. Andreasen J.O. Endod. Dent. Traumatol. 1998; 14: 31-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and physical trauma during orthodontic tooth movement (30Brezniak N. Wasserstein A. Angle Orthod. 2002; 72: 175-179PubMed Google Scholar, 31Leach H.A. Ireland A.J. Whaites E.J. Br. Dent. J. 2001; 190: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the permanent teeth undergo resorption. The tooth resorption seen in the amelogenin-null mice could be explained as a result of physical trauma due to enamel hypoplasia and attrition of molar cusps, similar to orthodontics movements. Interestingly, unlike these clinical conditions, amelogenin-null mice exhibit more resorption of the cementum than surrounding alveolar bone. The presence of multinucleated cells and TRAP-positive cells near the cementum and close to the lacunae, indicate their potential involvement in the cementum and dentin resorption process through the osteoclastogenic pathway.RANKL-mediated signaling is one of the mechanisms by which osteoclastogenesis is regulated. Bone resorption by active osteoclastogenesis requires the expression of RANKL, RANK, OPG, and TRAF 6 (32Hasegawa T. Yoshimura Y. Kikuiri T. Yawaka Y. Takeyama S. Matsumoto A. Oguchi H. Shirakawa T.

This activation requires the formation of a bitiscetin-VWF A1 complex, suggesting an allosteric mechanism of action. Here, we report the crystal structure of bitiscetin-VWF A1 domain complex solved at 2.85 Å. In the complex structure, helix α5 of VWF A1 domain lies on a concave depression on bitiscetin, and binding sites are located at both ends of the depression. The binding sites correspond well with those proposed previously based on alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Matsui, T., Hamako, J., Matsushita, T., Nakayama, T., Fujimura, Y., and Titani, K. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 7939–7946). Against our expectations, the structure of the VWF A1 domain bound to bitiscetin does not differ significantly from the structure of the free A1 domain. These results are similar to the case of botrocetin, another snake-derived inducer of platelet aggregation, although the binding modes of botrocetin and bitiscetin are different. The modeled structure of the ternary bitiscetin-VWF A1-GPIb complex suggests that an electropositive surface of bitiscetin may interact with a favorably positioned anionic region of GPIb. These results suggest that snake venom proteins induce VWF A1-GPIbα binding by interacting with both proteins, and not by causing conformational changes in VWF A1.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). VWF exists as a disulfide-linked multimer composed of identical ∼250-kDa subunits, each of which contains three adjacent A domains (A1, A2, and A3). The A1 and A3 domains have major binding sites for GPIb and collagens (types I and III), respectively, and the A2 domain contains the cleavage site for the plasma VWF-cleaving protease (ADAMTS13), which regulates the functional multimer size of VWF (2Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Binding between VWF A1 domain and GPIbα is evident only when blood is exposed to high shear stress in vivo (3Peterson D.M. Stathopoulos N.A. Giorgio T.D. Hellums J.D. Moake J.L.

Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A structural change in the Asp560–Gly561 region was observed in the structure of the VWD type 2B “gain-of-function” A1 domain mutant, which binds spontaneously to GPIb under physiological conditions (6Celikel R. Ruggeri Z.M. Varughese K.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Binding of VWF to platelets in vitro occurs in the presence of various modulators, such as the antibiotic ristocetin (7Hoylaerts M.F. Nuyts K. Peerlinck K. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or snake venom proteins bitiscetin (8Hamako J. Matsui T. Suzuki M. Ito M. Makita K. Fujimura Y. Ozeki Y. Titani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or botrocetin (9Fujimura Y. Kawasaki T. Titani K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Snakes employ bitiscetin and botrocetin to disrupt hemostasis and thereby to kill or weaken their prey; these modulators have been used extensively as tools to study the complicated mechanisms involved in hemostasis. Bitiscetin and botrocetin are members of C-type lectin-like proteins (CLPs). The first determination of the complete amino acid sequence of CLPs was carried out using coagulation factors IX- and X-binding protein (IX/X-bp) from Trimeresurus flavoviridis (habu snake) venom (10Atoda H. Hyuga M. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14903-14911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Up to the present time, various CLPs have been sequenced and characterized with a variety of activities that affect plasma proteins, platelets, endothelial cells, and subendothelial structures. Thus, CLPs with diverse activities appear to be derived from a common ancestor. In this connection, IX/X-bp and IX-bp from habu snake venom have diversified their amino acid sequences in an accelerating manner (11Atoda H. Yoshihara E. Yamada M. Morita T. Thromb. Res. 1997; 87: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) as also observed for crotalinae snake venom gland phospholipases (12Nakashima K. Ogawa T. Oda N. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Kihara H. Ohno M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5964-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and serine proteases (13Deshimaru M. Ogawa T. Nakashima K. Nobuhisa I. Chijiwa T. Shimohigashi Y. Fukumaki Y. Niwa M. Yamashina Y. Hattori S. Ohno M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As shown for the digestive enzymes in venom, which vary predictably in response to differences in diet (14Jennifer C.D. Wolfgang W. Roger S.T. Nature. 1996; 379: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), CLPs have evolved possibly to gain functional diversity in response to important components in the hemostatic system of their prey. CLPs are heterodimeric proteins consisting of homologous subunits A (α) and B (β) linked by a disulfide bond. Both subunits show a similarity to carbohydrate recognition domains of the classic C-type lectins. The crystal structure of IX/X-bp (15Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Koizumi M. Kano H. Atoda H. Morita T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) shows that the two subunits are tightly associated by domain swapping, and this dimerization results in the creation of the concave surface predicted to function as a coagulation factor binding site. Examination of the crystal structure of the complex between X-bp and the γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain of factor X has revealed that the binding site is, in fact, the concave surface (16Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Atoda H. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7230-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The structures of CLPs with various functions have been solved by x-ray crystallography (15Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Koizumi M. Kano H. Atoda H. Morita T. Nat. Struct.

Matsui T. Hamako J. Morita T. Titani K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13592-13597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CLPs have many structural similarities despite having distinct functions, suggesting that electrostatic interactions, as well as size and shape matching, are important for ligand binding. The concave surfaces of many CLPs have been proposed to form the binding site for a variety of highly diverse ligands. In this connection, we previously showed that the electrostatic potentials on the concave surface are significantly different among IX/X-bp, bitiscetin, and botrocetin (20Hirotsu S. Mizuno H. Fukuda K. Qi M.C. Matsui T. Hamako J. Morita T. Titani K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13592-13597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, Fukuda et al. (21Fukuda K. Doggett T.A. Bankston L.A. Cruz M.A. Diacovo T.G. Liddington R. Structure. 2002; 10: 943-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported the crystal structure of a botrocetin-VWF A1 complex; they found no large structural change compared with the uncomplexed A1 domain and suggested that the activation of binding by botrocetin is distinct from that of high fluid shear stress. Although bitiscetin and botrocetin have similar effects on VWF function, they are expected to bind VWF A1 quite differently based on the results of alanine scanning studies (22Matsushita T. Meyer D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11044-11049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Matsui T. Hamako J. Matsushita T. Nakayama T. Fujimura Y. Titani K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7939-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and also based on the differences in pI and in electrostatic potentials on the concave surface as mentioned above. To better understand the mechanism by which venom modulators affect hemostasis, we solved the crystal structure of bitiscetin-VWF A1 domain complex. The structure refined at 2.85 Å resolution showed that bitiscetin binds to the A1 domain via its concave surface in a manner different from botrocetin. The bitiscetin contact sites on the A1 domain partially overlapped with those of botrocetin, but the direction of the long-axis of bitiscetin was almost perpendicular to that of botrocetin when the bound A1 domains were superimposed. As in the case of the botrocetin-VWF A1, our structure showed no significant change in the VWF A1 domain. Bitiscetin- and botrocetin-VWF A1 complexes and their electrostatic potential maps revealed a positively charged patch on each venom protein, which is located very close to the anionic region of GPIbα. We propose that this positively charged patch of snake venom modulators plays a key role in the induction of GPIb-binding without inducing a significant conformational change in the GPIb-binding site on VWF. Materials—Bitiscetin was purified from crude venom of Bitis arietans (purchased from ICN Biomedicals Inc.) as described previously (8Hamako J. Matsui T. Suzuki M. Ito M. Makita K. Fujimura Y. Ozeki Y. Titani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recombinant VWF A1 domain (residues 497–708), expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (24Miura S. Li C.Q. Cao Z. Wang H. Wardell M.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7539-7546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), was further purified with MonoQ (Amersham Biosciences) and TSK-GEL G2000SW gel filtration column (Tosoh). The affinity of VWF A1 binding to immobilized bitiscetin was measured by a surface plasmon resonance assay using Biacore 3000 (Biacore AB), and a high affinity with a Kd 2nm was obtained. Bitiscetin and VWF A1 domain were mixed in a 1:1.3 molar ratio, placed on ice for 2–3 h, and then loaded on Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with sample buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl). Complex-containing fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Microcon, Millipore) to 6 mg/ml. The concentration of protein complex was estimated by absorbance at 280 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 96,930 liters/mol·cm and a molecular weight of 53,455 for the complex. Crystallization and Data Collection—Needle-shaped crystals were obtained with a sitting-drop vapor diffusion technique by mixing 3.0 μl of protein solution (6 mg/ml) and 2.5 μl of reservoir solution. The reservoir solution consisted of 88% Crystal Screen II (Hampton Research) no. 30 solution (0.1 m Hepes-Na, pH 7.5, 10% polyethylene glycol 6000, 5% 2-methyl pentanediol) and 12% Crystal Screen II no. 46 solution (0.1 m Bicine-Na, pH 9.0, 20% polyethylene glycol-monomethyl ester 550). The crystals were typically grown to maximum size in 2 weeks at 285 K. A crystal (0.8 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm3) was transferred with a nylon loop to cryoprotectant solution consisting of 83% reservoir solution and 17% glycerol and was then rapidly frozen by a cold nitrogen stream at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected at Photon Factory BL-6B (Tsukuba, Japan) with an R-AXIS IV++ imaging plate detector (Rigaku). The data were integrated by using MOSFLM (25Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) followed by scaling with SCALA (26Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Diffraction rings from unknown salts were observed in all images at 3.23 Å (data not shown), therefore, the diffraction spots within the 3.30–3.16 Å resolution range were excluded during the data processing. The crystals belong to tetragonal space group P41 or P43 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 89.28 Å, c = 53.39 Å. The V M value (27Matthews B.W. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Model Building and Refinement—The initial model was built by the molecular replacement method using bitiscetin (Protein Data Bank entry 1JWI) and wild type VWF A1 domain (Protein Data Bank entry 1AUQ) as search models. Molecular replacement calculations with AMoRe (28Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) were applied independently using each model in the resolution range of 10 to 4 Å. The highest solution from each model indicated that the space group of the crystal was P43, with correlation coefficients of 0.353 (VWF A1) and 0.184 (bitiscetin) and R-values of 0.482 (VWF A1) and 0.530 (bitiscetin). Applying the corresponding transformation matrices, a proper bitiscetin-VWF A1 complex model could be easily built. Molecular replacement calculations using the complex gave a correlation coefficient and R -value of 0.693 and 0.331, respectively. Subsequent rigid-body refinement, simulated annealing, and individual B-factor refinement were done with the program CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse R.W.-K.

After several cycles of refinement, the R-factor and R-free (12% of the reflections) decreased to 19.4 and 27.6%, respectively. The final model includes residues 3–127 (α-subunit) and 3–125 (β-subunit) of bitiscetin, 501–702 of VWF A1 domain, and 40 water molecules. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.

Overall Structure of Bitiscetin-VWF A1 Complex—Bitiscetin, as well as other CLPs, has a heterodimeric structure, and VWF A1 domain binds to the concave surface of bitiscetin (Fig. 1a). The concave surface often functions as a ligand-binding site as shown previously for the structure of X-bp complexed with the factor X γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain (16Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Atoda H. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7230-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Helix α5 of the A1 domain is positioned near the center of the concavity, near the junction between the bitiscetin α and β subunit, but interacts mainly with the β-subunit, leaving a solvent-filled space between discontinuous binding sites at both ends of the concave surface of bitiscetin. Helix α4 of the A1 domain contacts the α-subunit of bitiscetin, burying a solvent accessible surface of ∼177 Å2, and sheet β6 and helices α5 and α6 contact the β-subunit, burying a solvent accessible surface of ∼431 Å2 (Fig. 1a). A comparison with the structure of the botrocetin-VWF A1 complex shows that the botrocetin- and bitiscetin-binding sites overlap at A1 helices α4 and α5. The direction of the long-axis of bitiscetin is almost perpendicular to that of botrocetin when the bound A1 domains are superimposed. Although bitiscetin (516 Å2) and botrocetin (520 Å2) make contact with A1 domains, bitiscetin binds more tightly than botrocetin, with Kd values of 2 and 12 nm (24Miura S. Li C.Q. Cao Z. Wang H. Wardell M.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7539-7546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), respectively. This may be due to a number of solvent-mediated interactions and comfortable fitting of the A1 domain to the concave surface of bitiscetin compared with the case of botrocetin. Interaction of Bitiscetin and VWF A1 Domain—At the contact region on the α-subunit (contact 1), direct hydrogen bond interactions are observed between Tyr64 of bitiscetin and Arg632 of the VWF A1 domain (hereafter, the amino acid residues of bitiscetin and VWF A1 will be listed in the same order) and between the main chain carboxyl of His106 and Gln639, and indirect water-mediated interactions are observed between Asp65 and Gln628 and between the O atom of Val63 and Asp119 (Fig. 1b). In the contact region on the β-subunit (contact 2), hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions are found. A hydrophobic patch on the β-subunit composed of Leu58, Val64, Leu65, Phe104, and Ile109 contacts a hydrophobic surface of the A1 domain that is composed of Pro655, Leu659, Ile662, and Val676. Adjacent to the hydrophobic region, hydrogen bonded interactions are found between Trp111 and Lys117 in the β-subunit and Glu666 in A1, between Gln110 and Arg663, between Glu22 and Lys673, between Lys20 and both Gln686 and Glu689, and between Arg115 and the backbone oxygens of Glu666, Lys667, and Ala669 (Fig. 1c). In addition, a hydrogen bond between Glu96 in the bitiscetin α-subunit and Lys660 in the A1 domain is observed. Comparison of the Bitiscetin-VWF A1 Structure with Mutagenesis Results—Recently, Matsui et al. (23Matsui T. Hamako J. Matsushita T. Nakayama T. Fujimura Y. Titani K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7939-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported the localization of bitiscetin-binding sites on the VWF A1 domain by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. According to this report, three A1 domain mutations on helix α5 (K660A, E666A, and K673A) and one mutation on helix α4 (R632A) significantly reduced binding to bitiscetin. These results are in good agreement with our structural data, because all of these residues are involved in hydrogen bond interactions with bitiscetin (Fig. 1, b and c). Interestingly, the A1 mutant R663A showed 1.5-fold higher binding activity relative to the wild type A1 domain (23Matsui T. Hamako J. Matsushita T. Nakayama T. Fujimura Y. Titani K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7939-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The side chain of Arg663 interacts with Gln110 in the β-subunit of bitiscetin, one of the major interactions between the A1 domain and bitiscetin (Fig. 1c), and mutation of Arg663 might be expected to reduce the affinity of binding. This contrary result may be explained as follows. The orientation of Arg663 in bitiscetin-free A1 structure is different from that in the bitiscetin-complexed structure; when A1 domains are superimposed, the Arg663 in unbound A1 collides with Trp111 of the bitiscetin β-subunit (Fig. 1c, inset). Moreover, Arg663 makes intramolecular hydrogen bonds with Glu666 in the free A1 structure that must be broken when bitiscetin binds. Therefore, the mutation R663A may promote binding to bitiscetin by avoiding the need to rearrange the hydrogen bonds and orientation of Arg663, which may be costly in terms of energy. Comparison with Other von Willebrand Factor A1 Domain Structures—Several studies suggest that structural changes in the A1 domain can increase the affinity of binding to GPIb (4Miyata S. Goto S. Federici A.B. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9046-9053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Ruggeri Z.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For example, VWD type 2B mutations in the VWF A1 domain, such as I546V, promote binding to GPIb independent of fluid shear stress (4Miyata S. Goto S. Federici A.B. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9046-9053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the I546V mutant A1 domain revealed a small structural change in residues Asp560–Gly561 at the edge of strand β3 (6Celikel R. Ruggeri Z.M. Varughese K.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Fukuda K. Doggett T.A. Bankston L.A. Cruz M.A. Diacovo T.G. Liddington R. Structure. 2002; 10: 943-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and this change was proposed to cause the increase in affinity for GPIb (6Celikel R. Ruggeri Z.M. Varughese K.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of GPIbα-A1 complex, hydrogen bonding interaction are observed between the main chain carboxyl of Asp560 and side chain Oγ of Thr240 in GPIbα (31Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), suggesting that the conformation of Asp560–Gly561 could change upon GPIbα binding. In the bitiscetin-complexed A1 structure, however, the Asp560–Gly561 region has the same conformation as in wild type uncomplexed A1 (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, when the wild type or I546V A1 structures were superimposed onto the bitiscetin-complexed A1 structure, no significant structural changes were found at either the bitiscetin- or GPIbα-binding sites (Fig. 2a). Large structural changes were observed only in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of A1 domain that flank the Cys509–Cys695 disulfide bond. These regions are expected to be changeable because of their location outside of the disulfide loop, and indeed their flexibility is evident from the crystallographic B-factors in these regions. Predicted Model of the Bitsicetin-VWF A1-GPIbα Ternary Complex—The crystal structure of the VWF A1 (R543Q)-GPIbα (M239V) complex reveals two binding sites on the A1 domain for GPIb: a major site at the “top” of A1 involves the β3 strand, α3 helix, and part of the α3-β4 loop; a minor site at the “bottom” of the domain involves loops α3-β4, β3-α2, and α1-β2. In the structures of A1 complexed with bitiscetin or botrocetin, however, no significant changes are observed in these regions. Moreover, in the structure of the botrocetin-A1 (I546V) complex, the main chain carboxyl of Asp560 has the same conformation as the uncomplexed wild type A1 domain, despite the use of a gain-of-function A1 mutant (21Fukuda K. Doggett T.A. Bankston L.A. Cruz M.A. Diacovo T.G. Liddington R. Structure. 2002; 10: 943-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that bitiscetin and botrocetin stimulate the binding of A1 to GPIb by a mechanism that does not require allosteric conformational changes in VWF A1. The modeled structure of the bitiscetin-VWF A1-GPIbα ternary complex (Fig. 3) indicates that the binding sites of bitiscetin and GPIbα on the A1 domain do not overlap, so that GPIbα could bind easily to the bitiscetin-VWF A1 complex. In this model, the β-subunit of bitiscetin is well separated from GPIbα, whereas the α-subunit of bitiscetin and the C terminus of the GPIbα fragment are approximated. This model is consistent with the observation that monoclonal antibodies to the α-subunit inhibit GPIb binding to the bitiscetin-A1 complex, but antibodies to the β-subunit do not (23Matsui T. Hamako J. Matsushita T. Nakayama T. Fujimura Y. Titani K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7939-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Implications for the Mechanism of GPIb-A1 Domain Binding Induced by Venom Proteins—The electrostatic potential of bitiscetin-A1 complex shows that there is a positively charged patch close to the C terminus of GPIb fragment in the modeled ternary complex (Fig. 4, left). The positively charged patch of bitiscetin is constructed from α-subunit residues Lys17, Lys20, Lys21, Lys61, and Lys120. A similar positively charged patch is also found in the botrocetin-A1 complex (Fig. 4, right), which consists of α-subunit residues Arg98 and Lys101 and β-subunit residues Lys102, Lys107, Trp109, Arg115, and Lys117 (botrocetin residues are numbered according to Ref. 19Sen U. Vasudevan S. Subbarao G. McClintoc R.A. Celikel R. Ruggeri Z.M. Varughese K.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We propose that these positively charged patches observed in both venom proteins are the key to the activation of GPIbα binding to the A1 domain. At the C terminus of the GPIbα fragment, there is an anionic region (residues 269–279) characterized by three sulfated tyrosine residues, Tyr276, Tyr278, and Tyr279 (32Dong J. Li C.Q. Lopez J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13946-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The removal of these sulfate moieties, whether by mutation or by inhibition of sulfation, severely impairs the ability of botrocetin to induce VWF-dependent platelet aggregation (33Marchese P. Murata M. Mazzucato M. Pradella P. Marco L. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9571-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34Dong J. Ye P. Schade A.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16690-16694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) indicating that the anionic region of GPIb plays an important role in the high affinity binding of botrocetin-A1 complexes. The anionic region of GPIbα was disordered in the structure of the binary VWF A1-GPIbα complex (31Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of uncomplexed GPIbα, there were two molecules in the asymmetric unit; in one molecule the anionic region was observed but in the other it was disordered (35Uff S. Clemetson J.M. Harrison T. Clemetson K.J. Emsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35657-35663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the anionic region of GPIbα is flexible but could adopt a specific conformation upon binding to a nearby positively charged site on bitiscetin or on botrocetin complexed with VWF A1. Based on their GPIbα-VWF A1 structure, Huizinga et al. (31Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) proposed that the N and C termini of the A1 domain, which are located at the bottom face, shield the binding site from the β-finger of GPIbα. Consequently, structural changes in domain A1 would be necessary for GPIbα binding, and such a requirement for conformational change is consistent with many biochemical and structural studies. However, the crystal structures of the botrocetin-A1 complex (21Fukuda K. Doggett T.A. Bankston L.A. Cruz M.A. Diacovo T.G. Liddington R. Structure. 2002; 10: 943-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the bitiscetin-A1 complex (Fig. 1) show no significant structural changes in the GPIbα-binding sites of the A1 domain compared with uncomplexed A1. Therefore, the possibility that botrocetin or bitiscetin allosterically activates the A1 domain seems unlikely. We propose that bitiscetin- or botrocetin-induced binding is not dependent on major structural changes of the A1 domain but instead depends mainly on electrostatic interactions between the anionic region of GPIb and a complementary electropositive site contributed by the venom protein in the VWF A1-botrocetin or VWF A1-bitiscetin complex (Fig. 5). Some experimental data indirectly support this model for botrocetin-induced binding of VWF to GPIb, but the effects of removing sulfated tyrosines or deleting the anionic region of GPIbα have not been studied yet with bitiscetin. For either of these venom proteins, a definitive test of this activation model will require additional biochemical and crystallographic studies of the corresponding ternary complex.

https://openalex.org/W1967061843,"Hsp90 is a specialized chaperone that controls the activity of many key regulator proteins such as steroid hormone receptors (SHRs). Hormone binding, and therefore SHR activation, requires Hsp90, which is loaded onto the receptors by a series of events involving Hsp70, Hsp40, Hop, and p23. The reverse transcriptase (RT) of hepatitis B viruses, small DNA-containing viruses that replicate via an RNA intermediate, has been reported to depend similarly on Hsp90 for enzymatic activity. Using an in vitro reconstitution system consisting of recombinant duck hepatitis B virus RT, purified chaperones, and the authentic RNA template Dϵ, we demonstrate here that this RT can be activated efficiently by just Hsp40 and Hsc70 plus energy, without the need for Hsp90 or other cofactors. The reaction appears to proceed selectively with the Hdj1 variant of Hsp40 but not Hdj2 or its yeast homolog Ydj1. The primary reaction product is a metastable, RNA binding-competent intermediate that decays quickly in the absence of its cognate RNA but, in its presence, accumulates in an initiation-competent form over several hours. Because deletion of the RNase H domain rendered the protein partly chaperone-independent, the chaperones may be needed indirectly to relieve occlusion of the RNA binding site by this domain. Our results do not exclude that other factors contribute to RT activation in vivo, but they challenge a fundamental SHR-like dependence on Hsp90. Thus Hsc70, mostly known for its role in general protein folding, is able to effect activation of a highly specialized target protein.

Thus Hsc70, mostly known for its role in general protein folding, is able to effect activation of a highly specialized target protein. Molecular chaperones are essential for protein folding in vivo; in the mammalian cytosol, probably some 20% of the newly translated proteins gain their final three-dimensional structure through interactions with members of the heat shock protein (Hsp) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; Dϵ, DHBV ϵ; DHBV, duck hepatitis B virus; HBV, hepatitis B virus; Hip, Hsp70-interacting protein; Hop, Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein; Hsc, cognate heat shock protein; NusDP*, activated NusDP; ORF, open reading frame; P*, RNA binding-competent form of P protein; RH, RNase H; RL, reticulocyte lysate; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; RT, reverse transcriptase; SHR, steroid hormone receptor; TP, terminal protein. 70 family (the constitutively expressed Hsc70, and the stress-inducible Hsp70 proteins; DnaK in bacteria), assisted by cochaperones of the Hsp40 family (DnaJ in bacteria) (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar). A fraction of these Hsc70/Hsp40 substrates requires further interactions with the specialized chaperone Hsp90, which are mediated, and modulated, by cochaperones such as Hop (Hsp-organizing protein), Hip (Hsp70-interacting protein), p23, and others (2Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The best known Hsp90 client proteins are signaling kinases and, in particular, steroid hormone receptors (SHRs). Induction of their transcriptional trans-activation function depends on binding of the cognate hormone ligand. Binding competence is generated through interactions of the unstable ligand binding domain with Hsp90 (3Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 4Cheung J. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Buchner J. Trends Biochem.

Once properly folded the ligand binding domain may bind hormone, or return to a binding-incompetent conformation for new cycles of activation. Hsp90 binding does not occur directly but via an energy-dependent multistep process that most likely involves transient interactions with Hsp40 and Hsp70 followed by formation of an intermediate complex containing Hsp70, Hop, and Hsp90, and finally conversion into a mature, ligand binding-competent receptor complex containing Hsp90, p23, and usually a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat immunophilin family. Ligand binding activity has been reconstituted from purified receptors, deprived of their cellular partners, by incubation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RL) which is an abundant source for the aforementioned chaperones and cochaperones and, more recently, entirely from purified components. Optimal activation required a minimal set of five factors, namely Hsp70, Hsp40, Hop, Hsp90, and p23 + ATP (7Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C. McMahon N. Toft D. J. Biol.

Among a few other non-kinase and non-transcription factor proteins, two reverse transcriptases (RTs), telomerase (12Forsythe H.L. Jarvis J.L. Turner J.W. Elmore L.W. Holt S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15571-15574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and the P protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are also thought to require Hsp90 for activation (13Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). HBV, the causative agent of acute and chronic hepatitis B in humans (14Blumberg B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7121-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), is the type member of the hepadnaviruses, small DNA-containing viruses that replicate through an RNA intermediate (15Summers J. Mason W.S. Cell. 1982; 29: 403-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Related animal viruses, e.g. woodchuck hepatitis B virus and duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), are important model systems. In all hepadnaviruses, a terminally redundant transcript, the pregenomic RNA, acts as mRNA for the capsid protein and P protein, and the same RNA is packaged into viral capsids and reverse transcribed into partially double-stranded circular DNA (16Nassal M. Intervirology. 1999; 42: 100-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Nassal M. Cann A.J. DNA Virus Replication. Vol. 26. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2000: 1-40Google Scholar). Both nucleocapsid assembly and replication initiation (Fig. 1) are triggered by the binding of P protein to an RNA stem-loop structure, ϵ, close to the 5′-end of the pregenomic RNA (18Knaus T. Nassal M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction induces conformational changes in the RNA (20Beck J. Nassal M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6265-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and in the protein (21Tavis J.E. Massey B. Gong Y. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5789-5796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to an initiation-competent ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. A specific RNA segment, forming a bulge in the free RNA, becomes a template for reverse transcription into a short (3 or 4 nucleotides) DNA oligonucleotide (22Wang G.H. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6507-6512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5579-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nassal M. Rieger A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a process referred to as priming. Unlike with other RTs, the 5′-terminal nucleotide is not added to a preexisting nucleic acid primer but instead is attached covalently to a Tyr residue (25Weber M. Bronsema V. Bartos H. Bosserhoff A. Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zoulim F. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the terminal protein (TP) domain, an additional N-terminal domain uniquely found in P proteins; the two other domains, carrying the DNA polymerase (RT) and RNase H (RH) activities, are conserved between P proteins and other RTs (27Eickbush T.H. Morse S.S. The Evolutionary Biology of Viruses. Raven Press, New York1994: 121-160Google Scholar). Subsequently, the covalent P protein-DNA primer complex is translocated close to the RNA 3′-end and extended from there into complete (-)-strand DNA (Fig. 1B). In the process, the RH domain of P protein degrades the original pregenomic RNA template except for a 5′-terminal oligonucleotide that then serves as a primer for plus-strand DNA. The end product is a partially double-stranded, relaxed circular DNA in which the (-)-strand DNA is still covalently fixed to P protein. Until recently, attempts to generate hepadnaviral P proteins in simple heterologous systems such as Escherichia coli were unsuccessful. Most of the replication details described above were therefore derived genetically. The first cell-free system allowing us to address more mechanistic questions was the in vitro translation of P protein in RL (28Wang G.H. Seeger C. Cell. 1992; 71: 663-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar); there, the RT of DHBV (but not that of HBV) is capable of performing the authentic initiation reaction, i.e. synthesis of the short DNA primer when provided with DHBV ϵ (Dϵ) RNA and dNTPs. Initially based on antibody depletion of several of the chaperones present in RL it was concluded that P protein requires Hsp70, Hsp90, and p23 for activity (13Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A second line of evidence was the proposed packaging into nucleocapsids of a complex of P protein with Hsp90 and p23, although only p23 was directly detected, possibly for a lack of high affinity anti-Hsp90 antibodies (29Hu J.

The frequent association of p23 with Hsp90 suggested, nonetheless, the simultaneous presence of Hsp90, although a Hsp90-independent, geldanamycin-resistant association of p23 with P protein was described in the same study. Geldanamycin, a drug that interferes with Hsp90-p23 interaction, also reduced DHBV replication in virus-transfected cells. However, hepadnavirus replication involves several phosphorylation steps, and kinases are a major Hsp90 target family; hence, various reasons for replication inhibition beyond a specific action of Hsp90 on the RT can be imagined. Several of these data sets may thus be open to alternative interpretations, but altogether they strongly suggested P protein as an Hsp90 client protein that might be activated in a manner similar to that of SHRs (Fig. 1A). More thorough testing this model was hampered by the low yields of full-length P protein obtainable by in vitro translation (in the range of 1 ng/μl) and the high abundance (in the range of 100 ng/μl) of most of the chaperones in question. Reconstituting a priming-competent P protein complex from purified components offers a potentially more feasible approach, given that a reliable source for recombinant P protein, preferentially free of mammalian chaperones, can be established. Previously we had shown that the TP domain and, after removing the C-terminal 25 amino acids, also the RT/RH domain of P protein could be expressed in E. coli as separate polypeptides in significant amounts. Although only a fraction of RT/RH was soluble, this was sufficient to reconstitute a priming-active complex from purified TP, RT/RH, Dϵ, and RL (30Beck J. Nassal M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7410-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), confirming the ability of the domains to complement each other in trans (31Lanford R.E. Kim Y.H. Lee H. Notvall L. Beames B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, initial experiments to activate these separate domains with purified chaperones failed, prompting us to rein-vestigate recombinant expression of a single chain P protein. Using two different E. coli proteins, NusA and GrpE, as fusion partners we were indeed able to produce and purify soluble, nearly full-length DHBV P proteins in substantial amounts. During this study, the successful reconstitution with purified chaperones of a more severely truncated P protein fused to glutathione S-transferase and expressed in E. coli, though in low amounts, was reported (32Hu J. Toft D. Anselmo D. Wang X. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In that study Hsp70, the yeast homolog of Hsp40 Ydj1, Hop and Hsp90 were found to be the minimal set of factors necessary and sufficient to activate the fusion protein; p23, previously considered to be crucial (29Hu J. Toft D.O. Seeger C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), increased the kinetics of, but was not essential for, complex formation. These results further supported the model of an SHR-like activation mechanism for the hepadnaviral RTs. Below we show that our new fusion proteins can be reconstituted into a priming-active complex with purified chaperones. Unexpectedly, Hsc70 and the human Hsp40 Hdj1 were necessary and sufficient to activate efficiently both P protein derivatives for Dϵ-dependent priming; only under special conditions could a very modest activity increase by the additional presence of Hop, Hsp90, and p23 be detected. Hence there is no fundamental requirement for Hsp90 in hepadnaviral P protein activation. The NusDP expression construct was obtained by cloning a modified P protein open reading frame (ORF) from DHBV strain 16 into the SacI and XhoI sites of pET43a(+) (Novagen). The P protein part of the encoded NusDP fusion protein (see Fig. 2), preceded by the bacterial NusA ORF, consists of amino acids 1–220 of the TP domain, a Ser-Pro-Gly linker replacing the spacer amino acids 221–348, and the complete RT/RH domain from amino acid 349, except that the nonessential 25 amino acids 762–786 from the C terminus were replaced by the peptide Val-Glu-(His)6. The NusDPΔRH construct, encoding a shortened P protein part lacking the sequence downstream of amino acid 575, was obtained by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. The GrpDP expression vector was constructed by replacing the NusA ORF between the NdeI and SpeI sites in the NusDP construct with a PCR product containing the 197-amino acid ORF of GrpE from E. coli. The fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 Codon Plus RIL cells (Stratagene). Cultures of 200-ml volume were grown to an A 600 of 0.6, and expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 4 h at 23 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. For cell lysis the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mg/ml DNase I) supplemented with 100 μl of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After incubation on ice for 1 h the lysate was sonicated and cleared by centrifugation and filtration through a 0.45-μm filter. The His-tagged fusion proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography using HiTrap columns and FPLC equipment (Amersham Biosciences). After equilibrating the column with 5 volumes of column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) the lysate was applied, and the column was washed with 10 volumes of washing buffer (column buffer containing 20 mm imidazole). The fusion proteins were eluted with a linear imidazole gradient. Peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), and stored in small aliquots at -80 °C. Protein concentrations as estimated by Coomassie Blue staining were in the range of 50–200 μg/ml. Hsp40 —The complete human Hsp40 (Hdj1) ORF (33Ohtsuka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) from plasmid pET-Hsp40 (kindly provided by J. Höhfeld) was amplified by PCR using a primer that replaced the stop codon by an XhoI site. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of the vector pET30a(+) (Novagen). The resulting plasmid pET30-Hsp40His encodes full-length Hsp40 with a C-terminal His6 tag. Protein expression and purification by nickel affinity chromatography were carried out essentially as described for NusDP, except that MgCl2 was omitted from all buffers. Peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. The yield of Hsp40 was in the range of 40 mg/liter E. coli culture. This preparation of Hsp40 was routinely used. We also tested commercially available purified recombinant human Hsp40 expressed in E. coli (Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada). No significant differences in activity were observed. Hsc70/Hsp70 —Purified recombinant bovine Hsc70 and human and rat Hsp70 were purchased from Stressgen. A plasmid construct encoding duck Hsc70 was kindly provided by M. Hild. The complete ORF was cloned into the pET30a(+) vector. Expression and purification of the C-terminally His-tagged duck Hsc70 protein by nickel affinity chromatography was performed as described above for Hsp40. Hsp90 —Recombinant human Hsp90β expressed in E. coli and human Hsp90 purified from HeLa cells were purchased from Stressgen. Alternatively, human and yeast Hsp90 were provided by J. Buchner (University of Munich, Germany). Yeast Hsp90 was shown, in-house, to have an ATPase activity comparable with that reported in the literature (34Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar); the human Hsp90, expressed in insect cells (35Buchner J. Bose S. Mayr C. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), had been characterized in Dr. Buchner's laboratory to be dimeric in gel filtration and to have ATPase activity with a k cat of 0.04 ± 0.02 min-1, similar to the k cat of 0.09 min-1 reported in the literature (36McLaughlin S.H. Smith H.W. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Other Chaperones—His-tagged human p23 was expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR column (37Schaaf, S. G. (1998) Characterization of the Interaction of Hepadnaviral P Proteins with the RNA Packaging Signal ϵ and with Cellular Proteins, Ph.D. thesis, University of HeidelbergGoogle Scholar). A cDNA for human Hdj2 was obtained from the Resource Center/Primary Data Base (RZPD; Berlin, Germany). The Hdj2 ORF was cloned into pET30a(+), and the full-length, C-terminally His-tagged Hdj2 protein was expressed and purified essentially as described above for Hsp40. Human Hop and yeast Ydj1 were also provided by J. Buchner. Dϵ RNA was obtained by in vitro transcription (T7 MEGAshortscript kit, Ambion, Austin, TX) from plasmid pDϵ1 linearized with ClaI as described previously (38Beck J. Bartos H. Nassal M. Virology. 1997; 227: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The transcript is nominally 76 nucleotides in length and contains the DHBV sequence from position 2557 to 2624. The DNA template was digested with DNase I. The RNA was phenol extracted, precipitated, and the RNA pellet was resuspended in H2O to a final concentration of 40 μm. Reconstitution reactions were assembled from 10 to 50 ng of purified recombinant P protein, 4 μl of RL (micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit RL, Promega), in vitro transcribed Dϵ RNA at a final concentration of 1 μm, 10 units of RNasin (Promega), and H2O to a final volume of 10 μl. All components were mixed and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Subsequently initiation-competent complexes were detected using priming assays (see below). Standard reconstitution reactions were assembled, in a final volume of 10 μl, by mixing the following components: 50 ng of purified recombinant P protein, 1.8 μg of recombinant bovine Hsc70, 2 μg of recombinant human Hsp40, Dϵ RNA to a final concentration of 1 μm, 2 μl of TKD buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm dithiothreitol), 1 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 25 mm MgCl2, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 100 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase), and 10 units of RNasin. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h and subsequently subjected to priming assays. The separately expressed TP plus RT/RH domains (30Beck J. Nassal M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7410-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the truncated NusDPΔRH protein were analyzed accordingly. For the analysis of NusDP* synthesis a 10-μl standard reconstitution reaction lacking Dϵ RNA was assembled and incubated at 30 °C. At the indicated time points 1-μl aliquots were taken and mixed immediately with 4 μl of dilution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing Dϵ RNA to give a final concentration of 1 μm. After 1 h at 30 °C, the samples were analyzed by priming assays. To investigate the stability of NusDP* a standard reconstitution reaction of 30-μl volume lacking Dϵ RNA was assembled and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Nucleotides were removed by RNA Quick Spin columns (Roche Applied Science) equilibrated in cold dilution buffer. The flow-through was incubated at 30 °C, and at the indicated time points, aliquots of 10 μl were taken and mixed immediately with Dϵ RNA to a final concentration of 1 μm. After 1 h at 30 °C the samples were analyzed by priming assays. In a parallel experiment whole RL instead of the two-chaperone system was used for reconstitution. The presence of priming-competent P protein complexes generated in the reconstitution assays was determined by in vitro priming assays with [α-32P]dATP, essentially as described previously (20Beck J. Nassal M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6265-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Samples from reconstitution assays were mixed with an equal volume of priming buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm NH4Cl, 12 mm MgCl2, 4 mm MnCl2, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm dGTP, 0.1 mm dTTP, 0.3 μCi/μl [α-32P]dATP (3,000 Ci/mmol)) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. 32P-Labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography or phosphorimaging (BAS-1500, Fuji), and quantified using MacBas software (Fuji). Efficient Expression in E. coli of Near Full-length DHBV P Protein—Our previous study had shown that the TP domain and a RT/RH domain lacking the last 25 amino acids (but not a protein containing the complete C terminus) could be expressed at high levels in E. coli (30Beck J. Nassal M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7410-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and confirmed earlier data that the spacer region connecting the domains in the authentic protein is dispensable for function (39Radziwill G. Tucker W. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a first attempt toward a recombinant single-chain P protein we covalently connected the domains by replacing the central 128 amino acids of the 180-amino acid spacer with a 3-amino acid linker; the 25 C-terminal residues of RT/RH were replaced by a His6 tag. This protein was expressed efficiently in E. coli but was totally insoluble. To overcome this problem, the same construct was then fused, at its N terminus, to the 491-amino acid E. coli NusA protein, which has been reported to increase substantially the solubility of several bacterially expressed proteins (40Davis G.D. Elisee C. Newham D.M. Harrison R.G. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 65: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion protein, termed NusDP (Fig. 2A), was indeed expressed efficiently in mostly soluble form in E. coli (Fig. 2B). Approximately 0.5–1 mg of NusDP could be purified from 1 liter of E. coli culture by nickel affinity chromatography using native buffer conditions. The purified protein fractions contained, in addition to several minor proteins of lower molecular mass, the full-length 133-kDa NusDP protein (Fig. 2B) at a concentration of 50–100 μg/ml. Reconstitution of a Priming-active Complex with NusDP and Whole RL—As a first test of whether NusDP, despite the relatively large 60-kDa NusA domain, could be reconstituted into a DNA synthesis-competent RNP complex we used whole RL as an established source for all necessary cellular factors. The assay used exploits the fact that successful initiation of DNA synthesis, i.e. priming, results in the covalent attachment of the oligonucleotide primer to P protein; if one of the dNTPs added is [α-32P]-labeled, the label is transferred to the protein. In addition, if a DNA primer is generated by the authentic Dϵ-dependent reaction its sequence must be the complement of the specific template region within Dϵ (see Fig. 1B) and hence correspond to 5′-GTAA (41Loeb D.D. Tian R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6886-6891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, and with appropriate modifications in the later experiments, the assay was performed in two subsequent steps: first NusDP and Dϵ RNA were incubated with RL, or later with individual chaperones, to allow for formation of the NusDP·Dϵ RNA RNP complex; second, DNA synthesis was induced by adding dNTPs, including [α-32P]dATP, dissolved in a buffer that is optimized for priming (25Weber M. Bronsema V. Bartos H. Bosserhoff A. Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but does not support further RNP complex formation (no priming signal is obtained upon immediate incubation of all necessary components in priming buffer; see below). Hence the amount of priming-active complexes generated during the initial incubation period can be assessed by measuring the radioactivity incorporated into P protein during the subsequent priming reaction. This second step was always performed for 1 h at 37 °C because the priming reaction is essentially complete after about 30 min in RL (28Wang G.H. Seeger C. Cell. 1992; 71: 663-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and also with purified chaperones (this study; data not shown). Under the standard assay conditions, NusDP indeed became 32P-labeled when preincubaded with whole RL (Fig. 2C). Here, and in the following experiments, the labeled NusDP protein always appeared as a doublet of two closely spaced bands; because the two bands were also seen under conditions allowing for incorporation of only a single nt (priming with [α-32P]dGTP; data not shown) they do not represent proteins with different lengths of DNA primer attached; rather the slightly faster migrating band corresponds to a proteolytic processing product of the full-length fusion protein. Labeling occurred only in the presence of Dϵ RNA and increased with increasing NusDP concentration. Hence NusDP is capable of authentic initiation of reverse transcription.

For example, although PMCA1 and PMCA4 have been detected in all tissues examined, PMCA2 and PMCA3 have only been found in significant amounts in the brain and a few other tissues.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2032-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), removing portions of the calmodulin binding sequence and leading to their “irreversible” activation. The protease contains regions with strong homology to calmodulin (domains IV and VI; Refs. 28Minami Y. Emori Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Minami Y. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which may be important in directing it to its target sequences. Support for this concept was provided by the binding of calpain to the calmodulin binding domain of the erythrocyte pump (27Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2032-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The proteolysis of the pump by calpain removes most of the C-terminal portion protruding into the cytosol, leaving behind a constitutively active fragment of about 124 kDa. The process has been studied on erythrocyte membranes or on the pump purified from them, i.e. on a mixture of the pumps isoforms present in erythrocytes, PMCA1, and PMCA4 (13Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because PMCA4 represents at least 80% of the total erythrocyte pump, it was not surprising that most of the peptides isolated after calpain digestion should have derived from this isoform (30James P. Vorherr T. Krebs J. Morelli A. Castello G. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T. De Flora A. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8289-8296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the failure to detect high molecular mass peptides deriving from PMCA1 indicated that the latter isoform had different calpain sensitivity. The work described here was performed to characterize biochemically the human PMCA1 isoform, including its calpain sensitivity. The pump was expressed in Sf9 insect cells with the help of the baculovirus system, but a complex DNA manipulation was required to generate a full-length PMCA1 clone devoid of mutations, which could be transferred to the baculovirus. The protein became expressed at lower levels than the PMCA2 and PMCA4 isoforms but could still be purified on a calmodulin-Sepharose column. The purified PMCA1 was activated by calmodulin, interacting with it with an affinity similar to that of PMCA4. However, it had a distinctly higher affinity for ATP in experiments measuring the formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate. In agreement with previous observations (31James P. Pruschy M. Vorherr T. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4253-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the purified PMCA1 was a better substrate for the cAMP-dependent kinase than PMCA4 and PMCA2. The PMCA4, PMCA2, and PMCA1 proteins were tested for calpain sensitivity in vitro. Although the PMCA1 isoform was rapidly and completely degraded, the PMCA4 and PMCA2 proteins were proteolyzed much more slowly and only to large active fragments. The digestion patterns of the PMCA2 and PMCA4 isoforms also differed. Whereas only the calmodulin binding domain and the sequence downstream of it were quantitatively removed in the case of PMCA4, a more complex pattern of degradation prevailed in the PMCA2 protein. Materials—m-CANP was isolated from freshly collected human erythrocytes as described in Ref. 27Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2032-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. The TNM-FH medium was from Sigma. Antibiotics and fetal calf serum were purchased from Invitrogen. The monoclonal antibody 5F10 was obtained from Milan Analytic AG (Hoffmann-La Roche). Nitrocellulose was from Schleicher & Schuell (Dassel, Germany). Nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate were from Promega (Madison, WI). All other reagents were of the highest purity grade commercially available. Construction of the Expression Vectors—To construct a full-length cDNA of human PMCA1, two clones (t6, t8.1) were used (32Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Standford D.R. Wiebenm E.D. Penniston J.T. Strehler E.E. Fisher R. Heim R. Vogel G. Mathews S. Strehler-Page M.-A. James P. Vorherr T. Krebs J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14152-14159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human PMCA1 isoform was used (also known as PMCA1b). The vectors used for the constructions were the pTZ18/19 (United States Biological, Swampscott, MA), the pSG5 (Stratagene, GmbH, Zürich, Switzerland), and the pVL1393 (provided by Dr. M. D. Summers, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX). DNA was purified by CsCl centrifugation (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Vols. 1–3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or by Qiagen columns (Quiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Different attempts to ligate fragments together to obtain a full-length construct resulted in a number of deletion-containing products. The use of PCR-directed mutagenesis to create suitable restriction sites or cDNA fragments was similarly unsuccessful. In a first step an XbaI, located in vector sequences proximal to the 3′-end of the PMCA1 and BamHI (nt 950, HUMPMPCA, GenBank™ accession number J04027) fragment, was subcloned together with a 900-bp SalI-BamHI (nt 950, J04027) fragment; the SalI was located in the vector proximal to the 5′-end, in the pSG5 SalI-XbaI cut vector. This vector was used because it yielded the highest amount of DNA of all those that were tried. No mutations were observed using this vector. After modifying the XbaItoa KpnI site, the PMCA1 cDNA was cut by SalI, blunt ended, cut by KpnI, and subcloned in pVL1393. The bacteria bearing the pVL1393 PMCA1 construct produced very low amounts of plasmid DNA. Generally, 2–4 μg of DNA could be purified from 250–500 ml of liquid cultures in 2XYT, corresponding to about one plasmid copy per bacterial cell. Culturing of Sf9 Cells and Construction of a Recombinant Baculovirus—Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were grown in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (both from Invitrogen) at 30 °C. PMCA1-containing DNA purified by two CsCl gradient centrifugations was cotransfected with Bak-Pak DNA (Invitrogen) to Sf9 cells using the Ca3(PO4)2 precipitation method as described (34Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1988) A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 1555, Texas A&M University, College Station, TXGoogle Scholar). The recombinant baculoviruses were identified by visual inspection of the viral plaques after plating on Sf9 cells and analyzed by dot blotting with PMCA1-specific probes. Putative recombinant viral plaques were checked for the correct insertion in the presence of 150 μg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-chloro-3-indolyl-b-d-galactoside; Bachem Feichemikalien AG, Dübendorf, Switzerland). The recombinant plaques were amplified and titrated as described (34Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1988) A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 1555, Texas A&M University, College Station, TXGoogle Scholar). More than 20 different recombinant viruses were isolated and tested for their ability to express the PMCA1 pump. Seven of them (see also Fig. 3A) expressed a protein of about 140 kDa. The band was absent in non-infected Sf9 cells. From some clones, viral DNA was prepared and analyzed by Southern blotting (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Vols. 1–3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Viral DNA was obtained from sucrose gradient purified viruses (34Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1988) A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 1555, Texas A&M University, College Station, TXGoogle Scholar). As expected, digestion with BamHI (a BamHI site is present in the pVL1393 vector just upstream of the PMCA1 sequence) and PstI-BamHI produced one fragment of 1000 bp and two fragments of 500 and 400 bp, respectively, which were recognized by probes spanning the coding sequence of PMCA1. Digestion with HindIII resulted in a PMCA1-specific fragment of 9500 bp, confirming that the PMCA1 was inserted at the right place in the genome of the baculovirus. After transferring the PMCA1 DNA to the latter, problems with the stability of the DNA were no longer encountered. Preparation of RNA, Northern Blotting, and Preparation of Digoxigenin Probes—2–4 × 107 Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus for 48 h. The cells were collected, washed twice in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and resuspended in 600 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2 on ice before the addition of 12.5 mm vanadyl-ribosyl complex (Invitrogen). Cytosolic RNA was then purified as described in Ref. 35Berger S. Birkenmeier C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5143-5149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar. Northern blotting was performed essentially as described in Ref. 36Guerini D. Garcia-Martin E. Gerber A. Volbracht C. Leist M. Merino C.G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1667-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar. DNA fragments were labeled with digoxigenin-dCTP (Roche Applied Science), using the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Preparation of Membranes—Sf9 cells were seeded at a density of 104/cm2 and left to attach for 1 h. They were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10 for 1 h, and then the inoculum was replaced by fresh medium. After 48 h the infected cells were collected, washed twice with TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and resuspended in 2 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (1 × 107 cells/ml). After 10 min on ice, the cells were homogenized in the presence of 75 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml anti-papain, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. The homogenate was diluted by adding an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% sucrose, and 300 mm KCl and centrifuged at low speed (750 × g) for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 500 μm MgCl2, 50 μm CaCl2. In some cases the membranes were prepared by a freeze and thaw procedure: the cells were washed twice with TBS, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 75 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA and disrupted by three cycles of freezing at –70 °C and thawing at 37 °C. Determination of the Protein Stability by Pulse and Chase Experiments—48 h after infection the cells were washed twice, incubated with methionine-deficient minimal Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), and buffered to pH 6.2 with 25 mm MES-KOH. After 20 min at 27 °C, the same medium containing 200 μCi/ml [35S]Met (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated for3hat27 °C. A portion of the cells was collected (time = 0). To the remainder a 10,000 excess of cold Met in TNM-FH, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin was added, and the cells were transferred to 27 °C. Membranes were prepared from them by the freeze and thaw method described above, solubilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. Membrane proteins corresponding to 3 × 106 cpm were diluted in 500 μl of NEM (50 mm Tris-HCl, 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% gelatin, 0.1% NaN3, 0.2% SDS, 0.3% Nonidet P-40) and mixed with 1–2 μl of monoclonal antibody 5F10. After gentle shaking for 1–2 h at 4 °C, 20–30 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were added, and the incubation was continued for2hor overnight at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with NEM, twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% NaN3, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Activity Measurements—The ATPase activity was measured as described in Ref. 37Lanzetta P. Alvarez L. Reinach P. Candia O. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar. The assays were performed on 10–30 μg of membrane proteins or, in the case of the purified protein, with 50–200 ng of protein in 500–1000 μl of 120 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μm thapsigargin, and 5 μg/ml oligomycin. The amount of CaCl2 needed to produce the free calcium concentration desired was calculated as described in Ref. 38Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar. The formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate from ATP was followed as described before (18Hilfiker H. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): additional details are given in the legends for the figures. In brief, total membrane proteins or purified enzymes were diluted in 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl in the presence of different concentrations of Ca2+, La3+, or EGTA. The reaction was started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (100–3000 Ci/mmol) on ice and stopped after 20 s by the addition of 6% trichloroacetic acid, 1 mm KH2PO4. The pelleted proteins were separated on acidic gels (39Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After drying, the gels were exposed at –70 °C for 2–5 days. SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and Protein Determination—Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as indicated in Refs. 40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar or 39Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were determined as described in Ref. 37Lanzetta P. Alvarez L. Reinach P. Candia O. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar. In some cases the gels were stained with a silver impregnation method (41Merryl C. Dunan M. Goldman D. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose or to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) according to Ref. 42Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar. The blots were processed essentially as described by Stauffer et al. (13Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) in the presence of PMCA-specific antibodies. After incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), the nitrocellulose was treated with monoclonal antibody 5F10 (1:2000 in TBST) or polyclonal antibodies 2A, 1N, 2N, and 4N (1:500 in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. After a further 30-min incubation with alkaline phosphatase coupled to goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), the immunocomplexes were detected with 66 μl of nitroblue tetrazolium and 33 μl of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate solutions (Promega) in 10 ml of alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2). Calmodulin Overlay—The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane sheets (42Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was blocked by 1% bovine serum albumin in TBSM (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20). For control experiments (unspecific binding), 1 mm EGTA was included in TBSM. The blots were incubated separately with different concentrations of biotinylated calmodulin (10–7 to 10–10m) in TBSM for 1 h, washed twice in TBSM, and incubated for another hour with avidin-coupled alkaline phosphatase in TBSM. The filters were developed with nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate in 10 ml of alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2). In all experiments the amount of the pump present was carefully calibrated by Western blotting performed in parallel. Only blots in which an identical amount of pump was present were evaluated. Phosphorylation of PMCA by the cAMP-dependent Kinase—Prior to the purification the membranes were treated with alkaline phosphatase (3 units/μg protein) (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min at 37 °C. After addition of DNase (20 μg/ml) and of RNase (10 μg/ml) on ice, the different PMCA isoforms were purified on calmodulin-Sepharose. The proteins were phosphorylated in a final volume of 400 μl of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 1–5 μg of reconstituted protein kinase A (Sigma) for 30–60 min at 37 °C. The phosphorylated proteins were treated with 0.2 m hydroxylamine for 30 min at room temperature and separated by SDS-PAGE. Calpain Digestion of the Ca2 + -ATPases—100 μg of membrane proteins obtained from infected Sf9 cells were incubated with 10 μl of calpain (1.5–2.0 μg) at 25 °C. The medium (0.2 ml final volume) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 μm CaCl2. A zero time point was taken before adding calpain. Aliquots were withdrawn at the times indicated in the legends for the figures, and the reaction was stopped by adding SDS gel loading buffer (17 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% urea, 1.7% SDS, 2% dithiothreitol, 1.7 mm EDTA, and bromphenol blue). Formation of the Phosphorylated Intermediate by the Pumps after Proteolysis with Calpain—25 μg of membrane proteins of Sf9 cells were incubated without or with calpain (0.37–0.5 μg) for 30 min in 50 μl of 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 100 μm Ca2+, and 100 μm LaCl3. The phosphorylation was started by adding 0.2 μm [γ-32P]ATP (500 Ci/mmol). After 30 s on ice, the reaction was stopped with 600 μl of cold 7% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm Na2HPO4. The precipitated proteins were divided into two aliquots (20 and 5 μg) and separated by acidic SDS-PAGE (39Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The portion of the gel containing the 20-μg aliquots was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and exposed overnight at –70 °C with an intensifying screen. The other portion of the gel was subjected to Western blot analysis using the 5F10 antibody. Trypsin Digestion of Membrane Protein-expressing PMCA Isoforms— 100 μg of Sf9 cell membrane proteins were resuspended in 200 μl of 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl. After taking the zero time aliquot, 2 μg of trypsin (Promega) were added to start the reaction. 40 μl of the digestion mixture were withdrawn at different times, transferred to a tube containing 2 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml), and separated by SDS-PAGE. Characterization of the PMCA1 Pump Overexpressed in Sf9 Cells—Blots of membrane proteins obtained from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses for PMCA1, and with recombinant viruses for PMCA4 (15Heim R.

https://openalex.org/W1986338199,"Speech and birdsong require auditory feedback for their development and maintenance, necessitating precise auditory encoding of vocal sounds. In songbirds, the telencephalic song premotor nucleus HVC contains neurons that respond highly selectively to the bird's own song (BOS), a property distinguishing HVC from its auditory afferents. We examined the contribution of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs to BOS-evoked firing in those HVC neurons innervating a pathway essential for audition-dependent vocal plasticity. Using in vivo intracellular techniques, we found that G protein-coupled, potassium-mediated inhibition, tuned to the BOS, interacts with BOS-tuned excitation through several mechanisms to shape neuronal firing patterns. Furthermore, in the absence of this inhibition, the response bias to the BOS increases, reminiscent of cancellation mechanisms in other sensorimotor systems."
https://openalex.org/W1974734522,"We have previously shown that nucleosomes act as a strong barrier to yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in vitro and that transcription through the nucleosome results in the loss of an H2A/H2B dimer. Here, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP), which never encounters chromatin in vivo, behaves similarly to Pol II in all aspects of transcription through the nucleosome in vitro. The nucleosome-specific pausing pattern of RNAP is comparable with that of Pol II. At physiological ionic strength or lower, the nucleosome blocks RNAP progression along the template, but this barrier can be relieved at higher ionic strength. Transcription through the nucleosome by RNAP results in the loss of an H2A/H2B dimer, and the histones that remain in the hexasome retain their original positions on the DNA. The results were similar for elongation complexes that were assembled from components (oligonucleotides and RNAP) and elongation complexes obtained by initiation from the promoter. The data suggest that eukaryotic Pol II and E. coli RNAP utilize very similar mechanisms for transcription through the nucleosome. Thus, bacterial RNAP can be used as a suitable model system to study general aspects of chromatin transcription by Pol II. Furthermore, the data argue that the general elongation properties of polymerases may determine the mechanism used for transcription through the nucleosome."

MORs recycle back to the cell surface upon agonist treatment, whereas most internalized DORs are targeted to lysosomes for degradation. By exchanging the carboxyl tail domains of MOR and DOR and expressing the receptor chimeras in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells, it could be demonstrated that the carboxyl tail domain is not the sole determinant in directing the intracellular trafficking in these Neuro2A cells. Deletion of the dileucine motif (Leu245-Leu246) within the third intracellular loop of DOR or the mutation of Leu245 to Met slowed the lysosomal targeting of these δ-opioid receptors. Meanwhile the mutation of Met264 to Leu increased the rate of agonist-induced receptor internalization and the lysosomal targeting of the wild type and the δ-opioid receptor carboxyl tail chimera of the μ-opioid receptor.

Willins D.L. Kroeze W.K. Drug Alcohol Depend. 1998; 51: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 3Smythies J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 267: 1363-1367Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The receptors are further trafficked to the late endosomes where the decision for recycling or degradation takes place (4Moore R.H. Tuffaha A. Millman E.E. Dai W. Hall H.S. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 329-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because receptor endocytosis basically is a process to remove active receptors from the cell surface, in the past, such receptor trafficking has been considered to be a step in which the receptor signals are terminated. However, recent data have suggested that receptor endocytosis has other functions. The dephosphorylation and resensitization of the β2-adrenergic and A2-adenosine receptor required the receptor internalization and trafficking to the endosomes (5Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 6Mundell S.J. Kelly E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases by β2-adrenergic receptor could be blocked by inhibitors of receptor endocytosis, such as dominant negative arrestin (7Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Activation of the MAP kinases by α2-adrenergic receptor was reported also to be dependent on the endocytosis of the receptor but appears to be cell line-specific (8DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The fate of the activated MAP kinases was shown to be dependent on the internalized GPCR. This was demonstrated by the nonendocytosed mutant of PAR2 receptor-activated MAP kinases to translocate to nucleus, whereas the endocytosed PAR2 receptor-activated MAP kinases remained in the cytosol (11DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Thus, the GPCR signaling and the consequence of the signals are influenced by the receptor trafficking. Opioid receptor belongs to the rhodopsin subfamily of the superfamily of GPCRs. From the early studies reported by Chang et al. (12Chang K.J. Eckel R.W. Blanchard S.G. Nature. 1982; 296: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and Law et al. (13Law P.Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), it is clear that opioid agonist would induce δ-opioid receptor (DOR) internalization and subsequent down-regulation in neuroblastoma cells. Similar down-regulation of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) was observed in the neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells (14Zadina J.E. Chang S.L. Ge L.J. Kastin A.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 265: 254-262PubMed Google Scholar). Further, the internalized receptors were trafficked to the endosomes and subsequently to lysosomes as demonstrated with the intracellular accumulation of the ligand-receptor complexes in the presence of chloroquine (15Law P.Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4096-4104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such itinerary of the opioid receptor was substantiated after the cloning of the opioid receptors. Using epitope-tagged opioid receptor, the agonist-induced endocytosis of the receptors was demonstrated to involve the arrestin- and dynamin-dependent clathrin-coated pits pathway (16Li J.G. Luo L.Y.

Similar to other GPCRs, the importance of the carboxyl tails in the trafficking of the opioid receptors has been established. This was best exemplified by the ability of agonist to down-regulate the μ/δ-opioid receptor chimeras more rapidly (26Afify E.A. Law P.Y. Riedl M. Elde R. Loh H.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and morphine could internalize the μ/δ receptor chimeras but not the wild type receptor (27Whistler J.L. Chuang H.H. Chu P. Jan L.Y. von Zastrow M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 737-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Truncation of the carboxyl tail sequences also resulted in the blockade of agonist-induced MOR internalization (28Burd A.L. El-Kouhen R. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34488-34495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or the release of a brake mechanism in the DOR internalization (29Whistler J.L. Tsao P. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34331-34338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The importance of the carboxyl tail is demonstrated recently as the recognition motif for cellular proteins such as GASP that participate in lysosomal trafficking of DOR (30Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. Von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The exact motif within the carboxyl tail sequence in directing the opioid receptor lysosomal targeting remains unknown. Previous studies indicated that the mutation of Ser356 and Ser363 to Ala resulted in the blockade of MOR down-regulation (28Burd A.L. El-Kouhen R. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34488-34495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, other receptor sequences could participate also in the intracellular trafficking of the receptor. Mutation of Tyr336 of MOR within the highly conserved NPX 2-3Y motif of GPCR resulted in the attenuation of receptor down-regulation (31Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. Wang J.B. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27610-27616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This NPXY motif, where X is any amino acid, has been identified as consensus binding sequence for adenosine diphosphateribosylation factor (32Mitchell R. McCulloch D. Lutz E. Johnson M. MacKenzie C. Fennell M. Fink G. Zhou W. Sealfon S.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), which has a regulatory role in the endocytosis and recycling of the transferrin receptor (33D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and targets the recycling vesicles to the plasma membrane (34D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Further investigation of the NPX 2-3Y motif revealed that it was required for receptor interaction with agonist, G proteins, and GPCR kinases (35Ignatova E.G. Belcheva M.M. Bohn L.M. Neuman M.C. Coscia C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 56-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bohn L.M. Belcheva M.M. Coscia C.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the three components that are involved in receptor internalization. Thus, other motifs in addition to carboxyl tail could participate in the intracellular trafficking of the opioid receptors. Hence, in the present studies, the cellular motifs in directing the lysosomal targeting of opioid receptors are examined in the neuroblastoma N2A cell model. This cell model was used to mimic the presynaptic and dendritic location of the endogenous opioid receptors. By expressing the wild type receptor, μ/δ receptor chimeras, and the mutated receptors in the N2A cells, we determined that the carboxyl tail of the receptor alone could not direct the lysosomal targeting of the receptors. A di-leucine motif within the third intracellular loop is identified in conjunction with the carboxyl tail sequence to regulate the intracellular trafficking of the opioid receptors. Materials—Expression vector pcDNA3 was from Invitrogen. Taq and Pfu polymerase and restriction enzymes were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Cell culture reagents, DMEM, fetal bovine serum, were purchased from Invitrogen. [3H]Diprenorphine (50 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Etorphine and naloxone were obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Monoclonal antibodies 16B12 for the hemagglutinin (HA) protein was from Convance (Richmond, CA). An AlexaTM 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and LysoTraker®Red DND-99 were purchased from Molecular Probe (Eugene, OR). Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and streptavidin immobilized on agarose were from Pierce. Plasmid Construction—The human influenza virus HA, YPYDVPDYA, epitope-tagged opioid receptors HA-MOR and HA-DOR, and the receptor chimera constructs with the carboxyl tail exchanged (HAMOR/DT=HA-MOR with the DOR tail (DT) and HA-DOR/MT=HADOR with the MOR tail (MT)) were constructed as reported (26Afify E.A. Law P.Y. Riedl M. Elde R. Loh H.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and utilized in the construction of further mutant receptors. Point mutations were accomplished using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis method as outlined by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The methioline amino acid at position 264 of HA-MOR and HA-MOR/DT opioid receptors and leucine amino acid at position 245 of HA-DOR and HADOR/MT opioid receptors were mutated to leucine as the mutant M264L (5′-CTCAAGAGCGTTCGATTCCTATCGGGCTCCAAAG-3′) and methioline as mutant L245M (5′-GCCTGCGCAGCGTACGAATGCTGTCCGGTTCC-3′). Forward and reverse primers with the desired mutation and a designed endonuclease site were synthesized (bold letters represent mutated bases). After PCR, 10 units of DpnI endonuclease of each reaction were used to remove the original templates. Finally, 5 μl of the resulting incubation mixtures were transformed into competent XL-Blue cells. The mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture and Stable Transfection of N2A Cell with Wild Type and Mutant Opioid Receptors Plasmids—Mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells were cultured at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 15 mm glucose, 0.43 m NaHCO3, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum in a 10% CO2 incubator. Approximately 1 × 105 N2A cells were seeded in a 6-well clustered plate <24 h prior to transfection. 0.4 μg of plasmid DNA were transfected into these N2A cells with the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. 24-48 h after the transfection, the cells were passed at a 1:5 to 1:10 dilution into selective DMEM containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen). When visible clones were observed, single clones were then isolated, and these clones were screened for the level of receptor expressed determined by radioactive ligand binding assay as described previously (26Afify E.A. Law P.Y. Riedl M. Elde R. Loh H.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Flow Cytometry—The HA-tagged receptors on the plasma membrane was quantified by determining the immunofluoresence on the cell surface using FACS analysis. Briefly, Neuro2A cells stably expressing the indicated HA-tagged receptors were preincubated with 25 μl of 95% ethanol or with 25 μl of monensin (50 μm) in 95% ethanol for 1 h at 37 °C. Then cells were treated with 1 μm etorphine for different time period to induce receptor internalization. After rinsing twice rapidly with serum-free DMEM at 4 °C, the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min in serum-free DMEM with the anti-HA antibody (1:500 dilution). Afterward, the cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM at 4 °C and then incubated with Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:400 dilution) at 4 °C for additional 1 h. After washing the cells to remove the excess secondary antibodies, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde prior to FACS analysis. Receptor immunofluorescence was quantitated by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, CA). Fluorescence intensity of 10,000 cells was collected for each sample. Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson) was used to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells population. All experiments were conducted at least three times with triplicate samples in each time point of etorphine treatment. Confocal Microscopy—N2A cells expressing the wild type, receptor chimeras, or mutant receptors were grown on glass coverslips that were acid-cleaned and pretreated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-lysine (Sigma) until 50% confluent. The cells were incubated with primary 16B12 anti-HA antibody at 4 °C for 1 h so as to label the receptors. After washing to remove excess antibodies, 1 μm etorphine and 0.25 μm LysoTracker were added. After incubating at 37 °C for the designated time, the medium was removed, and the cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. The cell were then incubated with blocking buffer PBS diluent (0.3% Triton X-100, 1% normal donkey serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.2) for 1 h and then incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were dipped in distilled water and mounted by NO-FADE (PBS:glycerol 9:1, 0.1% p-phenylenediamine, pH 8.0). Confocal fluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 and a 60× objective. As for biotin staining, cells were biotin-labeled, etorphine-treated, and stripped as described below. Afterward the cells were fixed and permeabilized with PBS diluent and then incubated with Alexa 594-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h. After washing, the cells were incubated with primary mouse anti-HA and secondary goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 antibodies sequentially. Surface Biotinylation—To distinguish the recycling opioid receptors from the newly synthesized receptors, a cell surface biotinylation labeling system was applied. Stably transfected N2A cells expressing HA-tagged receptors were grown in 10-cm dishes to 90% confluence. After washing twice with PBS at 4 °C, the cells were biotinylated by incubating with 300 μg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Excess biotin was quenched and removed by washing twice with TSB (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 154 mm NaCl). Then DMEM at 37 °C was added to the biotinylated cells, and the cells were treated with 1 μm etorphine for designated time. After washing away the excess drug, the remaining cell surface biotin molecules were stripped in a solution containing 50 mm glutathione, 0.3 m NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, and 1% fetal bovine serum at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were then extracted with cell lysis buffer (0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, protease inhibitors mixture tablet Complete (Roche Applied Science; 1 tablet/50 ml)). Cellular debris was removed by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The clarified cell extracts were precipitated with streptavidin immobilized on agarose at 4 °C overnight. After washing five times with the cell lysis buffer, the beads were extracted with SDS sample buffer, and the eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 20% methanol) and blocked for 60 min in a blocking solution (10% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS). The receptors were detected by sequential 60-min incubation with mouse anti-HA (1:2000) and goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to AP (1:5000). Receptor band on the membrane were detected by the ECF substrate supplied by Amersham Biosciences and scanning the membrane with Storm 840 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Band intensities were quantitated and analyzed using the ImageQuant software supplied by Molecular Dynamics. For measuring the degradation kinetics, N2A cells were biotin-labeled as before. The cells were preincubated with 50 μm monensin with or without 100 μm leupeptin for 1 h and then treated with 1 μm etorphine for another 1 h to trap the receptor at the endosome. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were stripped to removed surface biotin and incubated in serum-free medium for the desired time at 37 °C in the presence or absence of leupeptin. Then cells were lysed, and the biotinylated receptors were immunoprecipitated by streptavidin immobilized on agarose. μ- and δ-Opioid Receptors Internalized at Different Rates in N2A Cells—To examine the molecular basis for the neuronal regulation of opioid receptor trafficking, the wild type MOR and DOR were expressed in a neuronal cell model, neuroblastoma N2A cells. These N2A cells do not express a detectable level of opioid receptor, and when these cells were transfected with the HA epitope-tagged receptors, the expressed receptors exhibited similar ligand selectivity and function as reported with other cell models (37Ko J.L. Arvidsson U. Williams F.G. Law P.Y. Elde R. Loh H.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After examining various transfecting techniques and reagents, because of the relative low efficiency in transfecting the plasmid DNAs into these N2A cells, stable cell lines were established, and clones expressing similar levels of wild type and mutant receptors were selected to carry out the current studies. The rate and the magnitude of receptor internalization were examined in two or three clonal cell lines for each plasmid construct, with no significant difference observed among cell lines expressing the same construct. When the N2A cells were treated with the opioid receptor nonselective agonist etorphine, similar to previous reports (26Afify E.A. Law P.Y. Riedl M. Elde R. Loh H.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), MOR and DOR internalized with different profiles. When the cell surface receptor level was determined using FACS analyses, 1 μm etorphine induced MOR to internalize in a biphasic manner (Fig. 1A). The amount of receptor internalization (45 ± 6.0%) peaked after 20 min of etorphine treatment. Subsequently, this was followed by a decline to a steady state level (∼41%) (Table I). The level of MOR being internalized increased to ∼49% after 4 h of etorphine exposure (data not shown). In contrast, DOR endocytosed in a monophasic time course that asymptotically increased toward a maximum level of ∼76% receptor internalized after 1 h of etorphine treatment (Fig. 1A and Table I). Although the maximal levels of receptors being internalized were different between the MOR and DOR, the initial rates of etorphine-induced receptor endocytosis were rapid for both receptors, with t ½ < 5 min (Table I).Table IThe kinetic parameters of the etorphine-induced endocytosis of μ- and δ-opioid and various mutant opioid receptors expressed in N2A cellsOpioid ReceptorHalf-lifeMaximal receptor level internalizedControl+MonensinControl+Monensinmin%HA-DOR5.0 ± 0.311 ± 1.276 ± 0.871 ± 6.9HA-MOR2.5 ± 0.47.8 ± 1.941 ± 2.556 ± 0.2HA-DOR/MT aThe t ½ and maximal internalization were calculated from monophasic exponential decay curve obtained during 4 h of etorphine treatment.34 ± 5.060 ± 5.679 ± 1.488 ± 2.5HA-MOR/DT7.5 ± 0.26.3 ± 1.568 ± 1.475 ± 4.1HA-DORL245M15 ± 1.229 ± 5.084 ± 1.090 ± 5.0HA-DOR/MTL245M13 ± 1.514 ± 1.941 ± 5.132 ± 0.5HA-MORM264L2.1 ± 0.23.4 ± 1.054 ± 2.356 ± 5.2HA-MOR/DTM264L4.2 ± 0.16.3 ± 1.581 ± 2.775 ± 4.1a The t ½ and maximal internalization were calculated from monophasic exponential decay curve obtained during 4 h of etorphine treatment. Open table in a new tab The differences in the maximal level of MOR and DOR being internalized could be caused by the rapid recycling of the MOR as reported previously (22Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). If this is the case, then monensin, a Na+ ionophore that blocks glycoproteins secretion and traps the receptors at endosomes, should increase the etorphine-induced MOR internalization in N2A cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, preincubating the N2A cells with 50 μm monensin altered the etorphine-induced MOR internalization rate to monophasic and increased the magnitude of receptor being internalized to ∼56% (Table I). However, even with comparable rates, the magnitude of MOR being internalized in the presence of monensin was significantly lower than that observed with DOR when measured in the absence of monensin. Such observation suggested that the endocytosis of the opioid receptor in N2A cells could be affected by the trafficking of the receptors to other cellular compartments, such as targeting to lysosomes. This hypothesis is partially supported by the decrease in the rate of DOR endocytosis to t ½ = 11 ± 1.2 min in the presence of 50 μm monension (Fig. 1A and Table I). Etorphine binding to the DOR was not altered by monensin. The FACS analyses determined the steady state levels of the cell surface receptors during etorphine treatment. Such analysis was unable to distinguish the newly synthesized receptor population from that internalized and subsequently recycled. Thus, prior to the addition of etorphine, the cell surface receptor pools were labeled with the sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After etorphine treatment, all of the cell surface biotin labels were stripped. Hence, only the internalized receptors would contain the biotin labels and could be immunoprecipitated by streptavidin. As shown in Fig. 1B, both MOR and DOR were biotinylated similarly in the absence of etorphine. The stripping conditions removed >90% of the biotin labels from MOR (Table II), suggesting that without agonist treatment, a minimal amount of the cell surface MOR was internalized. However, during the 30 min of incubation at 37 °C after biotinylation, >50% of the biotin on DOR could not be stripped (Table II). The presence of biotin on DOR was not due to incomplete stripping of the biotin-labeled cell surface receptor but rather caused by the rapid constitutive endocytosis of DOR. The amount of intracellularly located biotinylated DOR increased with prolonged incubation at 37 °C (data not shown). When the cellular location of the biotin-labeled proteins was examined with confocal microscopy, as expected, immediately after biotin labeling, the labels colocalized with the DOR and MOR at the cell surface (Fig. 2). Treating the N2A cells with the stripping solution resulted in the redistribution of some biotin-labeled proteins intracellularly, with no apparent colocalization of the biotin labels and the opioid receptors. Treating the cells with etorphine resulted in the endocytosis of the biotin labels that could not be removed by the stripping solution, and these labels colocalized with the opioid receptors (Fig. 2). Hence, the residual biotin-labeled DOR after stripping reflected the pools of DOR located intracellularly. As shown in Fig. 1B and Table II, ∼85% of the biotinylated DOR and ∼42% of MOR could not be stripped after 30 min of etorphine treatment, thus suggesting the agonist induced endocytosis of these receptors in N2A cells. Interestingly, the addition of monensin increased the amount of internalized biotin-labeled MOR, whereas monensin decreased the amount of intracellular located biotinylated DOR (Table II). These results were in agreement with the FACS analyses and supported the notion that MOR recycled after agonist-induced internalization in the N2A cells.Table IIPercentage of the cell surface receptor being internalized during incubation in presence or absence of etorphineOpioid receptorAmount of biotinylated receptorAmount of biotinylated receptor in presence of monensinControl+EtorphineControl+Etorphine%%HA-DOR57 ± 4.285 ± 3.851 ± 3.754 ± 4.2HA-MOR9.9 ± 1.342 ± 2.819 ± 2.257 ± 3.4HA-DOR/MT20 ± 1.750 ± 2.141 ± 2.455 ± 3.5HA-MOR/DT28 ± 2.085 ± 3.330 ± 2.3100 ± 3.4HA-DORL245M32 ± 3.484 ± 3.378 ± 3.3110 ± 3.1HA-DOR/MTL245M49 ± 3.641 ± 4.188 ± 1.987 ± 1.6HA-MORM264L32 ± 2.949 ± 3.441 ± 3.354 ± 2.5HA-MOR/DTM264L51 ± 3.0110 ± 1.261 ± 2.599"

AChE is inactivated by organophosphates as they pass through the P-site and phosphorylate the catalytic serine in the A-site. One strategy to protect against organophosphate inactivation is to design cyclic ligands that will bind specifically to the P-site and block the passage of organophosphates but not acetylcholine. To accelerate the process of identifying cyclic compounds with high affinity for the AChE P-site, we introduced a cysteine residue near the rim of the P-site by site-specific mutagenesis to generate recombinant human H287C AChE. Compounds were synthesized with a highly reactive methanethiosulfonyl substituent and linked to this cysteine through a disulfide bond. The advantages of this tethering were demonstrated with H287C AChE modified with six compounds, consisting of cationic trialkylammonium, acridinium, and tacrine ligands with tethers of varying length. Modification by ligands with short tethers had little effect on catalytic properties, but longer tethering resulted in shifts in substrate hydrolysis profiles and reduced affinity for acridinium affinity resin. Molecular modeling calculations indicated that cationic ligands with tethers of intermediate length bound to the P-site, whereas those with long tethers reached the A-site. These binding locations were confirmed experimentally by measuring competitive inhibition constants K I2 for propidium and tacrine, inhibitors specific for the P- and A-sites, respectively. Values of K I2 for propidium increased 30- to 100-fold when ligands had either intermediate or long tethers. In contrast, the value of K I2 for tacrine increased substantially only when ligands had long tethers. These relative changes in propidium and tacrine affinities thus provided a sensitive molecular ruler for assigning the binding locations of the tethered cations.

The primary physiological role of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 1The abbreviations used are: AChE, acetylcholinesterase; Boc, tert- butyloxycarbonyl; BOP, (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate; OP, organophosphate; MTS, methanethiosulfonyl; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography. is to hydrolyze the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The AChE structure has evolved to carry out this hydrolysis at rates that are among the highest known for enzyme-catalyzed reactions (1Rosenberry T.L. Meister A. Acetylcholinesterase. Advances in Enzymology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 43Google Scholar). One feature of the AChE catalytic pathway is the formation of an intermediate acyl enzyme that is hydrolyzed by water. It has long been known that AChE forms an acyl enzyme not only with carboxyl esters like acetylcholine but also with carbamic acid esters and phosphoric acid esters (also called organophosphates or OPs) and that these intermediates differ dramatically in their deacylation rate constants (2Burgen A.S.V.

D., ed) Vol. V, pp. 87-114, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). In particular, organophosphorylated AChEs are hydrolyzed some 1010 times slower than acetylated AChE and are effectively inactivated. OP inactivation of AChE results in failure of cholinergic synaptic transmission, deterioration of neuromuscular junctions, flaccid muscle paralysis, and seizures in the central nervous system. OPs have been developed not only as pesticides targeted to insect AChEs but also, deplorably, as chemical warfare agents directed at human AChE. Therapeutic strategies against OP toxicity have been limited. Nearly 50 years ago, Wilson and Ginsburg (6Wilson I.B. Ginsburg S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1955; 18: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) used the notion of complementarity in the AChE active site to introduce cationic oximes as strong nucleophiles that could reverse AChE organophosphorylation. These drugs remain a first line of defense against OP toxicity, but they act only on certain forms of inactivated AChE rather than protecting against OP inactivation itself. Important goals of our studies are to obtain new insights into the AChE catalytic mechanism and identify new strategies that may prevent OP inactivation. A number of studies have focused on the structural basis of the high catalytic efficiency of AChE. X-ray crystallography (7Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar) revealed a narrow active site gorge some 20 Å deep with two separate ligand binding sites. The acylation site (A-site) at the bottom of the gorge contains residues involved in a catalytic triad (His-447, Glu-334, and Ser-203) 2Throughout this report, residue numbers refer to the human AChE sequence. as well as Trp-86, which orients the trimethylammonium group of acetylcholine prior to hydrolysis. The peripheral site (P-site) consists of a binding pocket near the surface of the enzyme at the mouth of the gorge and specifically binds certain ligands like the neurotoxin fasciculin (8Karlsson E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23282-23287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that catalysis is accelerated because cationic substrates transiently bind to the P-site en route to the A-site (14Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7753-7763Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, ligand binding to the P-site also can inhibit AChE through a process we have called steric blockade (15Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7753-7763Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process involves a decrease in the rate constants with which substrates and their hydrolysis products enter and exit the A-site. The concept of steric blockade has led us to explore a new strategy for the design of drugs to protect AChE from OP inactivation. This strategy is to design cyclic compounds that will bind to the P-site with high affinity and selectively block the access of OPs while allowing entry of acetylcholine. Several approaches can accelerate the process of identifying cyclic compounds that have high affinity for the AChE P-site. Combinatorial chemistry in conjunction with structure-based design has been successfully employed to design high affinity ligands for therapeutic use. Molecular modeling effectively predicts good lead compounds that can then be refined using combinatorial chemistry approaches. To simplify molecular modeling calculations and to assure that cyclic compounds bind specifically to the rim of the AChE P-site in vitro, we have adopted a strategy in which we tether ligands via a disulfide linkage near the P-site. We previously showed that residue His-287 at the rim of the AChE P-site can be covalently linked to platinum(terpyridine) chloride to partially block access to the AChE active site (17Haas R. Adams E.W. Rosenberry M.A. Rosenberry T.L. Shafferman A. Velan B. Multidisciplinary Approaches to Cholinesterase Functions. Plenum Press, New York1992: 131-139Crossref Google Scholar). Because wild type human AChE has no free cysteine residues, we have mutated this histidine to a cysteine (H287C) to allow introduction of a wider range of tethered ligands at this location. Prospective compounds are synthesized with an MTS group, a highly reactive functional group that reacts with free cysteines to form a disulfide bond (18Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), thereby allowing their covalent linkage to H287C AChE. In this report, we test the feasibility of this approach using cationic trialkylammonium, acridinium, and tacrine ligands with demonstrated affinity for the AChE active site that are attached to MTS tethers of various lengths. We show that the length of the tether provides a molecular ruler which determines the catalytic properties of the modified AChEs. Materials—Recombinant human wild type and H287C mutant AChEs were expressed as secreted dimeric forms in Drosophila S2 cells in culture (15Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L.

The Boc-group was cleaved with 50% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane, and purification provided 9-(glycyl-7′-amidoheptyl)amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine (XII) as a light oil (M r calc = 368; found [M + H]+ = 369). Condensation of XII with VIII (1 eq) provided the desired compound VI, which was isolated after reverse phase HPLC purification and freeze-drying. Purity of the product by analytical reverse-phase HPLC was >76% (M r calc = 610; found [M + H]+ = 611). Reaction of MTS Reagents I-VI with Radiomethylated H287C AChE—Preparations of H287C were reductively radiomethylated with [3H]HCHO and sodium cyanoborohydride to allow better quantification of AChE protein following MTS labeling (26Haas R. Rosenberry T.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This procedure converts the primary amino groups at the N terminus and seven lysine residues in each AChE subunit to di-[3H]methylamines but has no effect on enzyme activity. Dialyzed H287C AChE was pretreated with 1 mm dithiothreitol in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) for 1 h at room temperature to ensure that the cysteine-free sulfhydryl group had not partially oxidized (27Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and excess dithiothreitol was removed by dialysis against 10 mm buffer (sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) in a Slide-a-Lyzer (Pierce) with 10,000 M r cutoff. MTS reagents corresponding to I-V were dissolved at 80-120 mm in 50 mm acetic acid. VI was dissolved at 1.8 mm because of lower solubility. The concentrations of IV-VI were established by absorbance (acridinium, ϵ410 = 8.08 mm-1 cm-1; tacrine, ϵ323 = 11.6 mm-1 cm-1). The compounds were then diluted to 6 mm (190 μm for VI) with AChE (3-20 μm) in 10 mm buffer and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The AChE sulfhydryl group displaced methanesulfinic acid from the reagents to form a disulfide bond, and the modified enzymes were dialyzed against 10 mm buffer and applied to an acridinium resin (20Rosenberry T.L. Scoggin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5643-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) affinity column (1-5 ml). The column was washed sequentially with 10 mm buffer, 10 mm buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mm buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 5 mm decamethonium bromide. Collected fractions were monitored for enzyme activity with the Ellman assay and for protein content by liquid scintillation counting. Steady-state Measurements of AChE-catalyzed Substrate Hydrolysis—Hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine was monitored with a spectrophotometric Ellman assay (28Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres J.V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21516) Google Scholar). Assay solutions included 0.33 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and hydrolysis was monitored by formation of the thiolate dianion 3-carboxy-4-nitrothiophenol at 412 nm (Δϵ412nm = 14.15 mm-1 cm-1 (29Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar)). Hydrolysis rates v were measured at various substrate concentrations [S] in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.02% Triton X-100 (pH 7.0) at 25 °C, and constant ionic strength was maintained with 0-60 mm NaCl (14Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The dependence of v on [S] for unmodified AChE was fitted to Equation 1, the Haldane equation for substrate inhibition (30Haldane J.B.S. Enzymes. Longmans, Green, New York1930: 84Google Scholar), by weighted nonlinear regression analysis (assuming constant percent error in v) with Fig.P (BioSoft, version 6.0). v=Vmax[S][S]1+[S]KSS+Kapp(Eq. 1) In Equation 1, V max = k cat[E]tot, where k cat is the maximal substrate turnover rate, [E]tot is the total concentration of AChE active sites, K SS is the substrate inhibition constant, and K app is the apparent Michaelis constant. [E]tot values for both wild type and unmodified H287C AChE were calculated by assuming 450 units/nmol (13De Ferrari G.V. Mallender W.D. Inestrosa N.C. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23282-23287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7753-7763Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), 3One unit of AChE activity corresponds to 1 μmol of acetylthiocholine hydrolyzed/min under standard pH-stat assay conditions at pH 8 (13De Ferrari G.V.

Chem. 1984; 259: 5643-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our conventional spectrophotometric assay at 412 nm is conducted in pH 7 buffer. With wild type AChE and 0.5 mm acetylthiocholine, this assay results in 4.8 ΔA 412nm/min with 1 nm AChE or about 76% of the pH-stat assay standard. and for radiomethylated AChE these [E]tot values were converted to dpm/nmol ratios that were also applied to the modified AChEs. Some residual unmodified H287C AChE remained after treatment with the MTS reagents, and fractionation of the reaction mixtures by affinity chromatography did not completely resolve the two enzyme populations. Because substrate hydrolysis by these two AChEs was characterized by different kinetic parameters, Equation 1 was extended to Equation 2. v=Vmax1[S][S]1+[S]KSS+Kapp+Vmax2[S][S]1+[S]KSS2+Kapp2(Eq. 2) Hydrolysis rates in Equation 2 are the sum of two terms from the Haldane equation. V max1 = k cat[E]1 and V max2 = k cat2[E]2. V max1, [E]1, k cat, K SS, and K app refer to the unmodified AChE population and V max2, [E]2, k cat2, K SS2, and K app2, to the modified. When fitting data for these AChE mixtures, k cat, K SS, and K app were fixed at the values obtained for unmodified H287C AChE; [E]tot was fixed at values calculated from dpm/nmol ratios; [E]1 was set to [E]tot - [E]2; and k cat2, [E]2, K SS2, and K app2 were allowed to vary. Inhibition Constants for Reversible Inhibitors—At low concentrations of substrate S with a homogeneous AChE, hydrolysis rates are determined by the second order hydrolysis rate constants z. In the absence of inhibitor, z is denoted z I=0 and corresponds to V max/K app. Measured z at various fixed [I] were fitted according to Equation 3 by weighted nonlinear regression analyses to obtain the inhibition constant K I and the experimental parameter α (13De Ferrari G.V. Mallender W.D. Inestrosa N.C. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23282-23287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). vI=0v≈zI=0z=1+[I]KI1+α[I]KI(Eq. 3) In Equation 3, values of z and z I = 0 either were determined as pseudo first-order rate constants ([S] = [S]initial e -zt (14Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)) or approximated by single rate measurements v and v I=0, in all cases at low substrate concentration ([S] < 0.2K app). K I is the equilibrium dissociation constant for I with E, and the constant α is the ratio of the second order rate constant with saturating I to that in the absence of I. With acetylthiocholine, 0 < α < 0.1 for P-site inhibitors (16Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and α ≅ 0 for A-site inhibitors. With two distinct populations of AChE composed of H287C AChE partially modified by MTS reagents, Equation 3 may be extended to Equation 4. vI=0v≈zI=0z=B(1-R2)1+α[I]KI1+[I]KI+R21+α2[I]KI21+[I]KI2-1(Eq. 4) In Equation 4, K I and α refer to the unmodified AChE population, K I2 and α2 refer to the modified enzyme, and R 2 is the fraction of total activity contributed by the second population in the absence of inhibitor. Data were fitted to Equation 4 by weighted nonlinear regression analysis with K I and α fixed at the values obtained for unmodified H287C AChE and α2 assigned equal to α. The B term reduced the emphasis on the v I = 0 point and was 0.99 ± 0.06 for all analyses. Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling was performed with InsightII software (Accelrys, Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics Indigo II workstation. The crystal structure of Torpedo californica AChE complexed with tacrine (1ACJ) was taken as the initial structure, and incompletely resolved residues were fully defined using InsightII. Hydrogens were added at pH 7.0, and the resulting structure was energy-minimized for several days to eliminate steric overlap. The histidine at position 287 was mutated in silico to a cysteine, and reagents in Table I were attached to H287C through a disulfide linkage. Energy minimizations were initiated from three different placements of the tethered ligand: extending away from the enzyme, into the P-site, and into the A-site. For tethers too short to reach the A-site, the carbon-carbon bonds were stretched until the quaternary amine group was within contact distance of Trp-86. Five computation cycles were performed, each involving energy minimization with the Discover 3 force fields in InsightII followed by a 250-fs interval of molecular dynamics at elevated temperatures (1000-2000 K). This prevented entrapment of the structure in a local energy minimum. The total potential energy function contained a van der Waals contact term (which included hydrophobic and aromatic interaction energies) and an electrostatic term. The peptide backbone and AChE side chains were fixed during energy minimizations with two exceptions: For minimizations in which tacrine or acridinium had to traverse a constriction between the P-site and the A-site (V and VI starting outside the A-site and IV starting in the A-site), Phe-337 and Tyr-72 were allowed to move. Without this flexibility the ligands were trapped and could not traverse the energy barrier at the constriction. Nevertheless, by the final cycle of energy minimization, Phe-337 and Tyr-72 had returned to their starting positions. When III-V were initially placed outside the active site, local energy minima were reached with the quaternary amine equidistant from Asp-74 and Asp-292. This location was an artifact, apparently resulting from the absence of explicit waters in the minimizations and the inappropriate extension of electrostatic interactions through the vacuum. To obtain the structures in Fig. 4 and the corresponding potential energy values in Table IV, Asp-292 was mutated to alanine to remove these local minima and allow significantly lower minima to be attained with the quaternary amine close to Asp-74.Table IVMinimized potential energies and tethered ligand locations in H287C AChE modified by MTS reagentsH287C modificationTotal potential energyaThe total potential energy minima were obtained as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.”Distance from Asp-74bThe distance indicated is measured between the Oδ of Asp-74 and the quaternary ammonium nitrogen.

Open table in a new tab Radiomethylation of H287C AChE and Modification with MTS Reagents—H287C AChE was covalently modified with the MTS reagents indicated by I-VI in Table I. The reagents lost methanesulfinic acid as they became tethered through a disulfide bond to the sulfhydryl group at residue Cys-287. Preliminary experiments indicated that tethered I-III with relatively short cationic groups had minimal effects on enzyme catalytic activity, whereas the larger cationic groups in IV-VI gave a pronounced reduction of activity. In fact, these larger groups decreased the catalytic activity to such an extent that residual unmodified AChE obscured the catalytic properties of the modified AChEs. Two procedures were implemented to circumvent this problem. First, stock H287C AChE was reductively radiomethylated to provide a sensitive radioassay of the AChE concentration in subsequent modification and purification steps. In addition, small acridinium affinity columns were introduced to separate H287C AChE treated with MTS reagents into three fractions (Fig. 1). The small amount of AChE inactivated by the labeling procedures was not retained by the column at all and was eluted in the initial buffer wash. H287C AChEs modified with larger cationic groups were bound to the resin with relatively low affinity. Merely increasing the ionic strength of the buffer solution to 0.5 m NaCl released these modified enzymes from the acridinium resin. AChEs modified with IV, V, and VI were in this category (Fig. 1, C and D). Finally, unmodified AChE and AChEs modified with the smaller cationic groups in I, II, and III bound with high affinity to the resin and were only eluted with high concentrations"

Therefore, it is not surprising that a close association exists between control of the retrograde regulon and expression of nitrogen catabolic genes. Expression of these latter genes is nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)-sensitive, i.e. expression is low with good nitrogen sources (e.g. glutamine) and high when only poor (e.g. proline) or limiting nitrogen sources are available. It has been reported recently that both NCR-sensitive and retrograde gene expression is negatively regulated by glutamine and induced by treating cells with the Tor1/2 inhibitor, rapamycin. These conclusions predict that NCR-sensitive and retrograde gene expression should respond in parallel to nitrogen sources, ranging from those that highly repress NCR-sensitive transcription to those that elicit minimal NCR. Because this prediction did not accommodate earlier observations that CIT2 (a retrograde gene) expression is higher in glutamine than proline containing medium, we investigated retrograde regulation further. We show that (i) retrograde gene expression correlates with intracellular ammonia and α-ketoglutarate generated by a nitrogen source rather than the severity of NCR it elicits, and (ii) in addition to its known regulation by NCR, NAD-glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH2) gene expression is down-regulated by ammonia under conditions where NCR is minimal. Therefore, intracellular ammonia plays a pivotal dual role, regulating the interface of nitrogen and carbon metabolism at the level of ammonia assimilation and production. Our results also indicate the effects of rapamycin treatment on CIT2 transcription, and hence Tor1/2 regulation of retrograde gene expression occur indirectly as a consequence of alterations in ammonia and glutamate metabolism.

A primary interface of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs at the early reactions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and retrograde genes (CIT2, ACO1, IDH1/2, and DLD3), encoding the enzymes that catalyze them (1Liao X.S.

Expression of these genes, mediated by transcription factors Rtg1/3, is high in ammonia-grown yeast with damaged mitochondria and low when cells are grown in glucose-glutamate medium. These characteristics led to the conclusion that retrograde enzymes produce α-ketoglutarate, needed for ammonia assimilation, in cells with damaged or inactive mitochondria. Earliest studies of the nutrient regulating retrograde gene expression identified glutamate as a negative regulator of the pathway (5Zhegchang L. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Subsequently, preferred nitrogen sources, glutamate and glutamine, were concluded to be negative regulators (7Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and their presence was detected by the Ssy1 amino acid sensor (11Liu Z. Sekito T.

A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) concluded, from experiments using the metabolic inhibitor l-methionine sulfoximine, that glutamine negatively regulates expression of both retrograde and nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)-sensitive genes (12Crespo J.L.

Expression of these genes is mediated by GATA transcriptional activators, Gln3 and Gat1/Nil1 (13Hoffman-Bang J. Mol.

Gln3/Gat1 localize to the nuclei of cells grown under conditions where NCR-sensitive transcription is high (poor nitrogen source) and to the cytoplasm when it is low (good nitrogen source) (15Cox K.H.

Gln3 and Gat1 also form a complex with Ure2 that correlates with conditions that restrict GATA factors to the cytoplasm (17Beck T. Hall M.N.

Treating cells with rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the phosphatidyl inositol-related kinases Tor1/2, results in dephosphorylation of Gln3, its nuclear localization, and thus increased NCR-sensitive transcription (17Beck T.

The response of Gln3 phosphorylation and nuclear-cytoplasmic localization in rapamycin-treated wild type cells and mutants with defects in Tor1/2 signal transduction pathway components have led to the conclusion that NCR-sensitive transcription is regulated by this pathway.Rapamycin also induces Rtg1/3-mediated retrograde transcription, and like Gln3, Rtg1/3 localizes to the nuclei of rapamycin-treated cells or cells where retrograde transcription is high and is cytoplasmic when such transcription is low (7Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 12Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Given the close physiological connection between ammonia assimilation and α-ketoglutarate synthesis, along with similarities observed in regulation of NCR-sensitive and retrograde transcription, it is easy to imagine the two regulons might be controlled together in parallel as reported.Our interest in retrograde expression was stimulated by reports that Mks1 was a positive regulator of NCR-sensitive and retrograde gene expression (20Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 21Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B. Genetics. 1999; 153: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar). The proposed regulatory pathways were as follows: NH3 or excess nitrogen ┤ Mks1p ┤ Ure2p ┤ Gln3p → DAL5, and rapamycin or limiting nitrogen ┤ Torp → Tap42 ┤ Mks1p → Rtg1/3p → CIT2, respectively. However, further investigation of these pathways led to the following conclusions. (i) Mks1p is a strong negative rather than positive regulator of CIT2 expression (8Sekito T. Liu Z. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9Dilova I. Chen C.Y. Powers T. Curr.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). (ii) Mks1 does not affect NCR-sensitive expression of DAL5 or GAP1 except indirectly by altering the amount of α-ketoglutarate available for ammonia assimilation (23Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). (iii) In contrast with NCR-sensitive expression, retrograde expression does not correlate with the quality of the nitrogen source provided in the medium but does correlate the product of its catabolism, i.e. glutamate or ammonia (23Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). (iv) Mks1-mediated regulation of CIT2 expression can be dissociated from the Tor signal transduction pathway, i.e. rapamycin does not suppress Mks1p-mediated negative regulation of CIT2 expression with proline as nitrogen source (23Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).When data from Komeili et al. (7Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and Crespo et al. (12Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), supporting the suggestion that NCR-sensitive and retrograde gene expression are regulated in common by glutamine, are compared with those of Tate et al. (23Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), several questions arise. (i) If glutamine is the nutrient regulating NCR-sensitive and retrograde transcription, why is CIT2 expression greater with either glutamine or ammonia than with proline as nitrogen source even though the first two nitrogen sources support greater NCR than proline (23Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)? (ii) Why does rapamycin fail to induce retrograde gene expression with proline as sole nitrogen source? (iii) Is it possible that proline, not a commonly used nitrogen source in retrograde gene expression studies, possesses an unique and previously unrecognized property?Investigating these questions, we discovered that retrograde (CIT2) gene expression closely correlates with the intracellular levels of ammonia and α-ketoglutarate generated by various nitrogen sources. Adding urea, a source of ammonia, to cells growing with proline as nitrogen source, deleting URE2, or adding rapamycin to ammonia grown cultures of yeast increases intracellular ammonia and CIT2 expression in parallel. In addition to up-regulation of CIT2 expression, ammonia also strongly down-regulates GDH2 expression under conditions where NCR is minimal. Therefore, ammonia possesses a dual role, positively regulating expression of genes whose products synthesize α-ketoglutarate needed for its assimilation, and negatively regulating GDH2, whose product generates ammonia from glutamate. Finally, induction of retrograde gene expression by rapamycin, and hence its regulation by the Tor1/2 signal transduction pathway, can be accounted for as indirect consequences of alterations in nitrogen metabolism.MATERIALS AND METHODSGrowth Conditions—S. cerevisiae strains (shown in Table I) were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 nm = 0.5-0.55) in Wickerham's minimal medium containing 2% glucose and the indicated nitrogen sources (proline, 0.2%; ammonia, glutamine, glutamate, asparagine, serine, or urea, 0.1%). Auxotrophic requirements were provided where necessary as follows: uracil (20 mg/liter), leucine (120 mg/liter), methionine (20 mg/liter), histidine, (20 mg/liter), lysine (40 mg/liter), arginine (20 mg/liter), tryptophan (20 mg/liter), and adenine (20 mg/liter). When a strain contained rtg2 or rtg3 mutations, glutamate (20 mg/liter) was included in the medium to cover the resulting auxotrophy. Wickerham's solid medium containing 2% glucose, 0.2% proline, 20 mg/liter uracil, 120 mg/liter leucine, and 20 mg/liter methionine was used to assess growth. Rapamycin was used at a final concentration of 200 or 300 ng/ml and was taken from a stock solution (1 mg/ml in 10% Tween 20 + 90% ethanol). Proline at 0.2 and 0.1% yields similar results; compare Fig. 1, A, lane A versus B, lane A and Fig. 3, B, lane G versus lane A. Ammonia at 0.1 and 0.5% yielded similar but not absolutely identical results. There was slightly higher CIT2 expression at the higher ammonia concentration; compare Fig. 5A, lane D versus Fig. 1B, lane C and Fig. 3, B, lane K versus lane E.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this workStrain numberGenotypeM970MATa, lys5/MATα, lys2YHE677MATa/MATα, mks1Δ::G418/mks1Δ::G418, ura3/+4852-1AMATα, ura2, leu2, met15, mks1::G418, rtg2::G4184852-1BMATα, ura2, leu2, met154852-1CMATα, ura2, rtg2::G4184852-1DMATα, ura2, mks1::G418Σ1278bMATαTCY1MATα, lys2, ura3YKHC7MATα, lys2, ura3, gat1Δ::hisG, gln3Δ::KANMX4RR132MATα, lys2, ura3, trp1, ure2::TRP1/MATα, lys2, ura3, trp1, ure2::TRP1K699MATα, ade2-1, trp 1-1, can 1-100, leu2-3,112, his3-11, 15, ura3, GAL+EY0735MATα, ade2-1, trp1-1, can1-100, leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, ura3, rtg3Δ::TRP1, GAL+ Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Growth correlated strain differences in retrograde gene expression.

Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1237-1246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sumrada R.A. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 10-ml sample of each culture to be assayed was transferred to a pre-warmed 50-ml flask (to maintain a constant surface to volume ratio) containing 14C uniformly labeled proline (final concentration, 4.3 × 10-6m). 1.0-ml samples were transferred to a 0.45-μm filter and quickly washed eight times with 2.5 ml of cold, minimal proline medium. Filters were then transferred to aqueous scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity they contained was determined in a Beckman 5801 scintillation counter. Methylamine transport assays were performed similarly to those with proline, except that the 1-ml reaction mixture contained radioactive methylamine at a final concentration of 1.45 × 10-4m.Analysis of Intracellular Metabolite Concentrations—The procedures we used were modified from those of Dubois et al. (28Dubois E. Grenson M. Wiame J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cultures (470-480 ml) of yeast stains M970 and RR132 were grown overnight at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.50-0.55 in Wickerham's minimal medium, containing 2% glucose, uracil (20 mg/liter), lysine (40 mg/liter), histidine (20 mg/liter), arginine (20 mg/liter), and the indicated nitrogen source (ammonium sulfate, glutamic acid, urea, glutamine, or serine at a final a concentration of 0.1% or proline at 0.2%). Cells were collected on a Millipore filter (type HA; 0.45 μm), washed twice with 200 ml of ice-cold water, and placed in l0 ml of 0.3 m HClO4 for 1 h at 0 °C (incubation for up to 4 h during reconstruction experiments using known concentrations of metabolites did not alter the results observed). Each extract was removed, and the filter and beaker were sequentially washed with 10 and 5 ml of ice-cold 0.3 m HClO4, and the wash solutions were added to the extracts. Extracts were then neutralized to pH 7.2 with 1 m K3P04, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C to remove cell debris and precipitated KClO4. Supernatants were carefully collected, their volumes were determined (28-34 ml), and the concentrations of NH4, α-ketoglutarate, and glutamate were measured. Supernatants were stored at -20 °C.Ammonia Determination—Ammonia concentrations were measured using 17 ml of extract, with an ammonium-specific electrode (Accumet). Standard ammonia concentration curves (ammonium chloride 10-6 to 10-3m) were prepared each time measurements were made. Reconstruction experiments, using known amounts of ammonium chloride and glutamine, verified the accuracy of our measurements and demonstrated that glutamine did not break down to ammonia and glutamate during extraction and ammonia assay procedures. Data are reported as nmol of metabolite/mg dry weight of cells. Ammonia concentrations (12.8, 13.1, and 18.4 nmol/mg dry weight) obtained from three independent cell preparations provide an indication of the precision we observed in these assays. All metabolite assays were performed two or more times with similar or greater precision being observed in all cases.α-Ketoglutarate—α-Ketoglutarate concentrations were determined using bovine liver Type II glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma) and monitoring NADH disappearance at 340 nm. Reconstruction experiments, using known concentrations of α-ketoglutarate, verified the accuracy of the assay.Glutamate Determination—Glutamate concentrations were determined using bovine liver Type II glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma). Enzyme assay conditions were standard except for the use of 3-acetylpyridine-NAD in place of NAD. This was done, because we noticed limited breakdown of NADH when extended periods were required for the assay to reach completion. Reconstruction experiments verified the accuracy of the assays and demonstrated that glutamine did not contribute to the glutamate concentrations we observed.RESULTSThe CIT2 Regulation Profile Is the Same with Glutamate and Proline as Nitrogen Source—Present experiments derive from two unexpected observations made during earlier studies of Mks1 and its participation in retrograde and NCR-sensitive gene expression (23Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar): (i) CIT2 expression is not detectable with proline as sole nitrogen source, and (ii) rapamycin is unable to induce CIT2 expression with proline as nitrogen source even though such expression occurs at high levels in proline-grown mks1Δ cells (23Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We investigated these observations further, because they heavily influence the interpretation of data concerning Tor1/2 regulation of retrograde transcription and the identity of metabolite(s) to which it potentially responds.Retrograde (CIT2) gene expression is usually measured in cells provided with ammonia or glutamate as sole nitrogen source (1Liao X.S. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 3Chelstowska A. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18141-18146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Velot C. Haviernik P. Lauquin G.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 893-903PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zhegchang L. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In contrast, we previously assayed CIT2 expression using proline as nitrogen source (23Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because CIT2 expression, with or without rapamycin treatment, had not been measured previously with proline in other laboratories, our first objective was to determine whether the same results would be obtained if we used the more standard nitrogen source, glutamate. Failure to obtain the same results with proline and glutamate would argue that earlier observations with proline derived from some specific characteristic of proline or its metabolism. Therefore, we compared CIT2 expression in proline-versus glutamate-grown cells (Fig. 1A). CIT2 expression was similarly low with both proline and glutamate (lanes A and B). Deletion of MKS1 dramatically increased CIT2 expression with both nitrogen sources, demonstrating CIT2 expression is also similarly down-regulated in minimal proline and glutamate media (lanes C and D).The second observation, i.e. rapamycin does not induce CIT2 expression in minimal proline medium, is important, because it cannot be easily rectified with the current model describing control of retrograde expression (7Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 12Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). According to that model, excess nutrients positively regulate Tor1/2, which in turn negatively regulates retrograde transcription via a regulatory pathway involving Tor1/2, Tap42, Rtg2, Mks1, and Rtg1/3. Because Tor1/2 is situated downstream of the nutrient signal, rapamycin treatment should inactivate Tor1/2 and induce retrograde transcription irrespective of the nitrogen source provided. Failure of rapamycin to induce CIT2 expression in proline-grown cells suggests the nutrient signal enters the signal transduction pathway below rather than above Tor1/2. Again, it was important to know whether proline possessed some special characteristic, or is rapamycin-induced CIT2 expression lost with glutamate as well? As shown in Fig. 1B (lanes A, B, E, and F), rapamycin is unable to induce CIT2 expression with either proline or glutamate. Only with ammonia does rapamycin induce CIT2 expression (Fig. 1B, lanes C and D). Therefore, the ability of rapamycin treatment to induce retrograde expression is clearly nitrogen source-dependent. The NCR-sensitive DAL5 control experiment eliminates the possibility that rapamycin entry or action differs with ammonia versus glutamate as sole nitrogen source (Fig. 1C, lanes C-F). In sum, these data support the contention that both results obtained earlier with proline (23Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) likely derive from its degradation to glutamate.Strain to Strain Variation in CIT2 Expression with Proline as Nitrogen Source—One of the serious challenges of comparing genome-wide or traditional transcription data from one laboratory to another are the effects of strain and growth condition differences, especially if they are unknown and hence cannot be taken into account. It is, for example, well known that ammonia elicits less NCR in S288C-derived strains than with those from a Σ1278b genetic background (29Bossinger J. Cooper T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This markedly alters expectations and interpretation of data when using ammonia as nitrogen source. Therefore, we determined whether retrograde, like NCR-sensitive, expression profiles exhibit strain-dependent differences. The epistasis experiment in Fig. 2A suggests this is the case. This experiment confirms the conclusion of Pierce et al. (10Pierce M.M. Maddelein M.L. Roberts B.T. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; : 13213-13218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), i.e. mks1 mutations are epistatic to those in rtg2 and are the data upon which we based our support of it (23Tate J.J. Cox K.H.

The unspliced genomic RNA of the virus has been shown to contain a large number of cis-acting sequences that influence transcription, splicing, intracellular transport, genome dimerization, and packaging. The leader region in particular is highly structured and has been extensively studied by a number of different groups to attempt to analyze both the structures and their functional significance. One function that has been consistently ascribed to the leader is the presence of a sequence that is used to identify the RNA genome for encapsidation into the viral particle. This is termed the packaging signal, abbreviated as the Greek letter ψ. The encapsidation signal must distinguish the genomic RNA from viral as well as cellular messages. In HIV-1, using deletion mutagenesis, we identified a region involved in packaging (1Lever A. Gottlinger H. Haseltine W. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4085-4087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was confirmed by other groups (2Aldovini A. Young R.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1920-1926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Clavel F. Orenstein J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5230-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since that time, a number of other regions inside and outside of the leader region have been implicated in packaging although largely in an enhancing role (4Russell R.S. Hu J. Beriault V. Mouland A.J. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. Liang C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Clever J.L. Eckstein D.A. Parslow T.G. J.

Secondary structure analysis of the ψ region identified a series of conserved stem loops, and disruptive and compensatory mutation confirmed the importance of these structures in retaining packaging function (Fig. 1) (9Harrison G.P. Lever A.M.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4144-4153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NMR-derived three-dimensional structures of the SL3 region have been published with and without complexed viral nucleocapsid protein (10Zeffman A. Hassard S. Varani G. Lever A.M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 877-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11De Guzman R.N. Wu Z.R. Stalling C.C. Pappalardo L. Borer P.N. Summers M.F. Science. 1998; 279: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In addition, NMR analysis of the major splice donor loop (SL2) and a fourth loop of uncertain functional significance (SL4) have been published (12Amarasinghe G.K. De Guzman R.N. Turner R.B. Chancellor K.J. Wu Z.R. Summers M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 491-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 13Amarasinghe G.K. De Guzman R.N. Turner R.B. Summers M.F. J. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 314: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The first stem loop in the packaging region (SL1) has been the subject of intense analysis because of its involvement in the dimerization process of the genomic RNA facilitated through the “kissing” interaction of the palindromic sequences at the tip (15Clever J.L. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3407-3414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proximal to the terminal loop of SL1, there is a second loop structure consisting of an AGG triplet opposite a single bulged G residue. This region is 100% conserved in all HIV-1 sequences so far identified and is thought to be important in the viral life cycle and, in particular, is thought to be critical for the occurrence of dimer linkage (15Clever J.L. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3407-3414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proximal to this loop, the predicted structures differ between different groups. We demonstrated previously that a further loop (loop A) could be identified by biochemical analysis, phylogenetic comparison, and free energy minimization, and that sequential truncation of SL1 showed a progressive decline in virus viability, culminating in complete loss when loop A was removed (16Harrison G.P. Miele G. Hunter E. Lever A.M.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5886-5896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently published NMR evidence supporting this secondary structure (17Greatorex J. Gallego J. Varani G. Lever A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 543-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Loop A consists of an AGGA facing a GG and is, again, 99% conserved in all known HIV-1 sequences and 100% conserved in known viable isolates. Intriguingly, the three-dimensional structure of this loop was found to be superimposable on another loop, that of the high affinity nucleation site of Rev on the Rev response element (RRE) found within the envelope gene sequence (18Battiste J.L. Mao H. Rao N.S. Tan R. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. Frankel A.D. Williamson J.R. Science. 1996; 273: 1547-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 19Dale T. Smith R. Serra M.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Rev-RRE interaction is a vital part of the virus life cycle involved in the switch from early to late gene expression. Rev-RRE binding permits nuclear export of the unspliced and singly spliced viral messages (20Cullen B.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 375-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rev also has been suggested to have additional effects such as enhancement of translation and packaging (21Kaye J.F. Richardson J.H. Lever A.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6588-6592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was, therefore, of great interest to determine whether the novel RNA structure we had identified in the leader region had the capability of binding Rev and whether that binding could be shown to be specific and to involve analogous nucleotide-amino acid interactions to those identified previously in the Rev·RRE complex. Proteins and Peptides—Recombinant Rev protein was obtained either from Bachem AG or through the European Union Program Centralized Facility for AIDS Reagents, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, UK (Grants QLKZ-CT-1999-00689 and CP8228102). Both comprised His-tagged bacterially produced proteins, which on gel analysis were monocomponent. It was used at a final concentration of 100 ng/μl. Recombinant Gag protein was generated in vitro in Escherichia coli as described previously (10Zeffman A. Hassard S. Varani G. Lever A.M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 877-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It was used at a final concentration of 200 ng/μl. The HIV-1 Rev peptide TRQARRNRRRRWRERQR, corresponding to the arginine-rich 34-50 amino acid region of the Rev protein, was purchased from Bachem AG and microdialyzed against an aqueous solution containing 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6), and 0.1 mm EDTA. Short peptides corresponding to the arginine-rich RNA-binding domain of Rev have been shown previously to have good solubility properties and to bind specifically to stem-loop IIB of the RRE with similar affinity (18Battiste J.L.

Biol. 2001; 8: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) Monoclonal Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies directed against HIV-1 Rev or HIV-1 Gag protein (p24 region) were obtained from the Centralized Facility for AIDS Reagents at National Institute for Biological Standards and Control as described above. DNA Preparation—DNA for in vitro transcription was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from the leader sequence of wild-type HXBc2 DNA and from a series of deletion mutants A1, A2, and A3 that sequentially truncate the SL1 sequence and that have been published previously (Fig. 5) (16Harrison G.P. Miele G. Hunter E. Lever A.M.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5886-5896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used for amplification were: forward, TAATACGACTCACTATAGGAAACCAGAGGAGC; reverse, CTCTCTCCTTCTAGCCTCCGC (Sigma Genosys). These generated the packaging signal region downstream of a T7 promoter sequence. The GGGG mutant of loop A was generated by PCR mutagenesis of the leader region in a DNA subclone and recloning of this region into the provirus. Dideoxy sequencing confirmed the integrity of the mutation in the provirus. The GGA mutant of loop B was used as a control for loop A in NMR studies and was generated in a similar fashion. DNA templates used for run-off transcription in preparation of NMR constructs were as described previously (17Greatorex J. Gallego J. Varani G. Lever A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 543-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription—RNA for in vitro experiments was prepared, according to the manufacturer's instructions, from PCR-derived DNA templates of the intact and mutated HIV leader region or from the HIV-1 RRE region using T7 RNA polymerase and the Ribomax reagents (Ambion). [α-32P]UTP (ICN) was incorporated into the RNA, and the labeled RNA was purified on a G25 column (Roche Diagnostics). For NMR, the first two nucleotides at the 5′ end of each DNA template had 2′-O-methyl modifications to increase the yield and purity of the transcripts (24Kao C. Zheng M. Rudisser S. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The RNAs were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (25Price S.R. Evans P.R. Nagai K. Nature. 1998; 394: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). All samples were microdialyzed against aqueous solutions with 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6), and 0.1 mm EDTA. The final RNA concentration in the samples was 0.7 mm in 300 μl of D2O or H2O with 10% D2O. RNA Protein Band Shifts—Purified RNA and Rev protein were incubated together for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of tRNA to prevent nonspecific binding in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 100 μm ZnCl2,5mm dithiothreitol) and then loaded onto 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and run at 100 mA. Where supershift assays were used, the monoclonal antibody was incubated after the initial Rev-RNA interaction for 30 min on ice prior to loading on the gel. Gels were removed and dried and exposed initially for 30 min and then subsequently for 12-72 h on x-ray film. NMR Spectroscopy—RNA and Rev peptide sample stock solutions were microdialyzed against the solution specified above. After calculating the stock concentrations by UV spectroscopy (∼1 mm), the RNA·peptide complexes were formed by successively adding Rev peptide aliquots to the RNA samples and measuring the effect on the RNA imino protons by NMR spectroscopy. After titration, the appropriate volumes of the final RNA·peptide complex samples were microdialyzed once more against the same solution conditions. 1H NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker DRX-500 and DMX-600 spectrometers and processed using xwinnmr or Felix 97 software. Multidimensional data sets were zero-filled to an appropriate size after multiplication of the time-domain data with shifted sine-bell functions. One-dimensional and two-dimensional NOESY (120 ms mixing time), TOCSY (60 ms), and ROESY (50 ms) spectra recorded with Watergate solvent suppression were obtained at different temperatures (15 and 24 °C). Similar spectra were also recorded in D2O. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a BIAcore2000 (BIAcore AB, Stevenage, UK). HIV Rev was covalently immobilized to the carboxylated dextran matrix on the surface of CM5 sensor chips via primary amino groups using the amine-coupling kit (BIAcore AB) as directed (20Cullen B.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 375-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After the activation step, purified HIV Rev was injected at 0.5 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium formate (pH 4.5) for 5 min. Different levels (300-1200 response units) of HIV Rev were immobilized by varying the length of the activation step from 5 to 15 min. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were performed at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C using commercially obtained (BIAcore AB) HEPES-buffered saline as the running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and 0.005% surfactant P20) supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2. The equilibrium binding responses were measured during injection of four concentrations of loop A RNA varying by 1 order of magnitude and the (control subtracted) equilibrium responses analyzed using Scatchard plots. Rev Binds to the SL1 Stem Loop—In Fig. 2, Rev can be seen to produce a distinct retarded RNA band that is not observed when the A1 deletion mutant, which completely truncates SL1, is used. Cold unlabeled SL1 RNA in ∼3-5-fold excess is able to compete away this binding, whereas unlabeled A1 RNA cannot. Cold RRE RNA can also compete the binding successfully again when in ∼3-5-fold excess (Fig. 3). Rev thus binds to the intact Ψ sequence only when the SL1 region is present and can be competed off by another native RNA ligand.Fig. 3Competition with the Rev response element disrupts the Rev·loop A complex. (See Fig. 2) RRE indicates presence of unlabeled RRE competitor RNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Bound Rev·RNA Can Be Supershifted—Incubation of the Rev·RNA complex with monoclonal antibody to Rev demonstrates a supershift of the RNA·protein complex (Fig. 4). To exclude nonspecific protein binding effects, a control antibody that binds to HIV-1 Gag was used, and this did not cause a supershift of the complex. The RNA species that is retarded in the presence of Rev is therefore a Rev-containing complex and not an effect of Rev on altering RNA structure in a nonspecific fashion. Sequential Truncation of SL1 Leads to Loss of Rev Binding—A series of truncated RNAs was produced corresponding to those used in previously published packaging studies (16Harrison G.P. Miele G. Hunter E. Lever A.M.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5886-5896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A3 removes the terminal palindrome-containing loop. A2 further deletes SL1 to remove the first internal loop (loop B). A1 removes loops A and B. All truncations introduce a heterologous sequence at the tip of the truncation. Fig. 5 compares the effects of the truncations on binding of Rev and Gag protein. Gag will bind most efficiently to the SL3 region, which is retained in all the constructs. The gel demonstrates that A3 and A2 truncations still bind Rev, although the latter is slightly less efficient than the wild-type binding. The A1 truncation, as shown previously, abrogates Rev binding although retaining competence to bind Gag. The mapping identifies the loop A region as having the most influence on binding Rev. A Mutation of Loop A Reduces Rev Binding—A more subtle mutation of SL1, which would be predicted to have little effect on the global structure of the region, was introduced. This substitutes two A purines for two G purines in loop A such that the structure becomes GGGG instead of AGGA opposing GG (Fig. 6). Using competition with unlabeled Ψ RNA to compare the affinity of the mutant sequence with that of wild-type Ψ, band-shift analysis shows that this mutant has a reduced but not abolished affinity for Rev, comparing lanes 2 and 6 or 3 and 7 (Fig. 6). NMR Spectroscopy Confirms Rev Binding to Loop A—Upon addition of the 34-50 Rev peptide, significant changes in the imino proton spectra of an RNA construct containing loop A (AGGA-GG) are observed. New resonances appear for several imino protons (e.g. U697, G730, G733, G728) connected by exchange cross-peaks with the corresponding resonances in the isolated RNA characterized previously by NMR spectroscopy (17Greatorex J. Gallego J. Varani G. Lever A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 543-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). Exchange broadening is also observed for almost all RNA protons in the one-dimensional and two-dimensional spectra. These changes clearly indicate Rev peptide binding to AGGA-GG. Indeed, similar alterations in the RNA spectra were also observed for the RRE-Rev interaction (26Battiste J.L. Tan R. Frankel A.D. Williamson J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2741-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27Peterson R.D. Bartel D.P. Szostak J.W. Horvath S.J. Feigon J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5357-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The AGGA-GG-peptide sample precipitates before a 1:1 stoichiometry can be attained, and this, together with spectral broadening, complicates the spectral assignments and NOE analyses of this complex. A number of exchangeable and nonexchangeable assignments could still be obtained for several RNA nucleotides (A695; stem and UUCG tetraloop nucleotides) and peptide residues (Thr1, Ala4, and Trp12). The RNA hairpin seems to retain the same general conformation when bound to Rev; similar chemical shift and NOE patterns for the UUCG tetraloop and stem nucleotides are observed as well as a strong NOE between A695 H2 and C696 H1′ within internal loop A detected previously in the isolated oligonucleotide (17Greatorex J. Gallego J. Varani G. Lever A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 543-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Additionally, broad NOEs between aromatic RNA resonances and peptide resonances (at 1.6 and 3.1 ppm) are observed in the nonexchangeable NOESY spectra. These interactions confirm Rev binding to the AGGA-GG oligonucleotide. To assess the specificity of the observed interaction, we also studied the interaction of Rev peptide with another SL1 RNA construct containing mutant loop B (GGA-G) instead of loop A. As with internal loop A, loop B is purine-rich, and the GGA-G oligonucleotide system was also characterized by NMR spectroscopy in our previous study (17Greatorex J. Gallego J. Varani G. Lever A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 543-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although some changes are present at the later stages of the titration, these are clearly less extensive than for loop A, indicating significantly less affinity of the Rev peptide for this purine rich bulge (supplementary material). Furthermore, addition of excess peptide to the loop B·Rev complex did not produce further spectral changes or sample precipitation. These data confirm the specificity of Rev binding to loop A rather than loop B in the SL1 region. Affinity of Rev for Loop A—Based on the exchangeable NMR spectra of AGGA-GG free and in complex with Rev peptide, the isolated AGGA-GG RNA and the AGGA-GG·peptide complex are in slow exchange on the chemical shift time scale; upon addition of Rev, new imino resonances appear (Fig. 7) that are connected by exchange cross-peaks to the imino resonances of free RNA. Because some of the exchanging resonances are separated by 0.1 ppm (50 Hz at 500 MHz), the loop A peptide-dissociation rate is below 100 s-1. Assuming a diffusion-limited association rate, this indicates that the dissociation constant should be smaller than ∼10 μm. The significant broadening observed for many exchangeable and nonexchangeable RNA resonances upon addition of Rev also indicates a peptide-RNA dissociation constant in the μm range. Spectra of Rev loop B mixtures showed no shifts indicating any interaction between these two molecules confirming that the loop A interaction was specific and not merely a nonspecific purine interaction with an arginine-rich peptide (data available as supplementary material). The affinity of Rev for loop A has also been determined using surface plasmon resonance. Visual inspection of the traces obtained shows that the interaction is characterized by moderately rapid on and off rates. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding leads to estimates for the K d of 1 and 2 μm from data sets recorded on channels with differing levels of coupled HIV Rev (Fig. 8). The affinity of recombinant Rev peptide (amino acids 34-50) against purified loop A RNA was also calculated using band-shift assays comparing bound and unbound RNA concentrations with known molarity of peptide. This was calculated using imaging intensifier methodology and gave a K d of 0.11 μm (data not shown). Our data confirm the hypothesis we proposed previously that loop A of the HIV-1 leader RNA can adopt a Rev-binding conformation (17Greatorex J. Gallego J. Varani G. Lever A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 543-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have now shown by direct band-shift assays that Rev binds specifically to this region. Additionally, the chemical shift variations, spectral broadening, and NOE interactions observed by NMR spectroscopy are all consistent with binding of the Rev peptide to an SL1 construct containing internal loop A. A comparison of the Rev peptide interaction with a similar RNA oligonucleotide containing a different purine-rich bulge suggests that the Rev-loop A interaction is specific, confirming the band-shift results. Although spectral broadening and sample precipitation obviates an ideal NMR study at 1:1 stoichiometry, there is good agreement between our findings and those of Battiste et al. (26Battiste J.L. Tan R. Frankel A.D. Williamson J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2741-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and Peterson et al. (27Peterson R.D. Bartel D.P. Szostak J.W. Horvath S.J. Feigon J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5357-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), who also detected spectral broadening and changes in the imino resonances of nucleotides adjacent to the Rev-binding bulge. Refinement of the conditions for a NMR spectroscopy study of the interaction between internal loop A and the 34-50 Rev peptide or suitable analogues is currently in progress. The SL1 loop already is predominantly in the “bound” conformation with the novel purine pairs, which the RRE only adopts after interaction with Rev (17Greatorex J. Gallego J. Varani G. Lever A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 543-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It was expected, therefore, that the affinity for binding of Rev to loop A would be different from that of the RRE because the SL1-Rev interaction would be expected to have a different biological role. Interestingly, unlike the Rev-RRE system, we see evidence for only a single binding event of Rev, although again the experimental conditions make it difficult to increase Rev concentration to seek evidence of multiple or cooperative binding patterns. The favorable conformation of SL1 may obviate further Rev assembly along the RNA. The lower affinity for loop A compared with the RRE does not imply lack of specificity, because both the band-shift data and the NMR comparison of loop A to loop B binding of Rev demonstrate clear single-site binding to this region in the context of both oligonucleotide and a longer in vitro transcript. Experimental data comparing the binding of Rev to loop A and loop B are available as supplementary material. The Rev-RRE system is a widely studied and highly efficient system for transporting lentiviral RNA from nucleus to cytoplasm. Rev, however, has had a number of other properties ascribed to it. Initially it was believed to subserve two functions, that of inhibiting RNA splicing as well as directing nuclear export; it may be, however, that the export function acts to reduce splicing simply by efficient removal of the RNA from the splicing environment. Rev has also been claimed to enhance RNA loading on ribosomes for translation (28D'Agostino D.M. Felber B.K. Harrison J.E. Pavlakis G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the past, we have shown that the RRE region itself enhances RNA packaging and can render a previously unpackageable RNA competent for encapsidation (21Kaye J.F. Richardson J.H. Lever A.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6588-6592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a role for Rev in packaging has again been implicated in vector studies in which nuclear export signals from different viruses, such as the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus constitutive transport element and the Woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional response element, have been incorporated into constructs and each shown to direct nuclear export of RNA as efficiently as Rev-RRE (29Schambach A. Wodrich H. Hildinger M. Bohne J. Krausslich H.G. Baum C. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The Rev-RRE system alone, however, appeared to enhance packaging efficiency in addition to export. This has led to the concept of a “packaging pathway” for RNA as a distinct trafficking channel optimizing the chance of a given RNA making contact with Gag protein and other viral and cellular cofactors to enable efficient encapsidation. The finding of a putative Rev-binding structure in the HIV-1 leader raises interesting questions. This area of the RNA has been modeled differently by a number of groups, and the nucleotides can, on computer prediction, be folded into a number of different base-pairing conformations (9Harrison G.P. Lever A.M.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4144-4153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Clever J. Sassetti C. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is recent evidence that the leader of HIV-1 and HIV-2 may undergo conformational changes during passage through the cell-forming structures, which do or do not favor dimerization and presumably affect packaging (31Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Huthoff H. Berkhout B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10439-10445Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 33Dirac A.M. Huthoff H. Kjems J. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2647-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the leader changes its conformation significantly when the Gag protein binds to the RNA, unwinding the helical regions and allowing Gag protein to bind along the RNA, which can then act as a scaffold element in viral assembly (10Zeffman A. Hassard S. Varani G. Lever A.M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 877-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recent articles on the leader have continued to generate different structural interpretations. Beerens and co-workers (34Berkhout B. Ooms M. Beerens N. Huthoff H. Southern E. Verhoef K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19967-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have used their data to derive a structure in which the base of the stem subtending the primer-binding site is extended and to derive base pairs using bases that we predict to be involved in SL1 formation. Clever et al. (35Clever J.L. Mirandar Jr., D. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12381-12387Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have also studied this region with detailed mutagenesis and have concluded that there is no evidence for this primer-binding site extension but that the bases we identify as occurring in loop A are critical for RNA packaging. Other recent work has suggested that the loop A we described and modeled using NMR is not substantiated on phylogenetic grounds (36Abbink T.E. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11601-11611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because the helical regions on either side of loop A are conserved in HIV-1 and the AGGA-GG bulges are 100% conserved in 99% of all sequences, and because the variants are minor purine-for-purine substitutions, it is difficult to see the basis for this argument. We would argue that the structure derived from a combination of phylogenetic analysis, free energy minimization, and biochemical probing (by which we initially modeled this region) has been reinforced by an NMR-based structural solution and now by Rev binding. This makes a compelling case that the original SL1-1 model we proposed (9Harrison G.P. Lever A.M.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4144-4153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Harrison G.P. Miele G. Hunter E. Lever A.M.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5886-5896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) exists as a functional entity and, in particular, that loop A exists and that Rev binds specifically to it. It is also encouraging that a recent elegant NMR analysis of the loop B region provides additional support for our structure, published previously (37Yuan Y. Kerwood D.J. Paoletti A.C. Shubsda M.F. Borer P.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5259-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The function for Rev binding to SL1 is as yet unknown, although to our knowledge one other group has also found evidence for Rev binding in this region. 2J. Kjems, personal communication. A clear possibility is that Rev acts to enhance export of both spliced and unspliced viral mRNAs through its loop A interaction in the early phase of the viral life cycle but that the higher affinity interaction with the RRE becomes dominant when sufficient Rev has accumulated in the nucleus to bind in a multimeric form to the RRE. This would provide a switch from early to late gene expression based on differing affinity and numbers of bound Rev proteins and is a plausible hypothesis that can be tested. This would also provide an interesting comparison with other RNA export mechanisms in other retroviruses in which all of the messages have an export signal on them, such as the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus constitutive transport element (38Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W. Hunter E. Jeang K.T. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1256-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The proximity of loop A to the major splice donor raises interesting possibilities regarding the effect of Rev on splicing documented previously; however a packaging function may also be possible. Whether Rev binding to SL1 has important implications for pathogenesis will depend on the specific role it may have in the life cycle of the virus. HIV-1-based vectors can be packaged in the absence of Rev indicating that it may not be critical for this process. However, in the context of wild-type virus replication, there may be an important role for Rev in the leader that makes it a further target for therapeutic interaction. Further work is currently under way to clarify this and to seek analogous structures in other lentiviruses. Download .pdf (.04 MB) Help with pdf files"

Here we describe our examination of the mechanism and structural requirements for the secretion of FGF-16 from COS-1 transfectants. Inhibition of its secretion by brefeldin A and identification of an N-glycan on the secreted form confirmed that FGF-16 is secreted by means of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, as are secreted proteins having a conventional cleavable signal sequence. Deletion of its N terminus abolished secretion of FGF-16. When chimerized with prolactin, however, the N-terminal sequence of FGF-16 was not able to mediate secretion of the chimera. Point mutations that made the N terminus less hydrophobic had little effect on secretion of FGF-16, whereas making the central hydrophobic region less hydrophobic abolished secretion. Within cells, an unsecretable FGF-16 N-terminal deletion mutant was distributed in the perinuclear region and overlapped the distribution of the Golgi apparatus. Mutants with less hydrophobic central regions were distributed evenly throughout the cytosol. Collectively, these results indicate that FGF-16 employs a unique bipartite signal sequence (i.e. both the N-terminal region and central hydrophobic region) that is not cleaved, although it shares the same secretory machinery used by secreted proteins with cleavable signal sequences.

Yoshioka M. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) involved in a variety of biological processes, including regulation of cell growth, differentiation, migration, angiogenesis, and tissue development (2Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 4Baird A.

Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The biological activity of FGFs is thought to be mediated in part by their interaction with both high and low affinity receptors (7McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) on the plasma membrane and in part by their intracellular interactions (8Uruno T. Oki J. Ozawa K. Miyakawa K. Ueno H. Imamura T. Growth Factors. 1999; 17: 93-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A group of receptor tyrosine kinases encoded by four genes serves as high affinity plasma membrane receptors for FGF family members (9Imamura T. Tokita Y. Mitsui Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 11Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Interaction with FGFs induces autophosphorylation of the receptors and initiates various signal transduction pathways (12Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The low affinity receptors consist of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which function to stabilize the ligands, concentrate them on the cell surface, and present ligand dimers to the tyrosine kinase receptors (13Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). To understand fully the biological functions of FGFs and how they are regulated, it is necessary to understand the mechanism and regulation of their secretion. Although many FGFs possess a conventional signal sequence, some do not. FGFs that do possess them are exported through a constitutive secretory pathway that includes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex/trans-Golgi network (14Ornitz D.M. Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (Reviews 3005)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signal sequence is usually located at the N terminus and is cleaved off by signal peptidase after the protein has crossed the ER membrane (15Dalbey R.E. Von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The primary structures of signal sequences vary widely, but are typically composed of a hydrophobic region (h-region) of 6–15 amino acids, a short stretch of 2–5 positively charged residues (n-region), and a hydrophilic region (c-region) of about 6 residues terminating at a small uncharged residue that contributes its carboxyl group to the peptide bond cleaved by signal peptidase (16von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). In contrast, FGF-9 (17Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), FGF-16 (18Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and FGF-20 (19Jeffers M. Shimkets R. Prayaga S. Boldog F. Yang M. Burgess C. Fernandes E. Rittman B. Shimkets J. LaRochelle W.J. Lichenstein H.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3131-3138PubMed Google Scholar) all seem to be secreted despite their lack of cleavable, N-terminal signal peptides. We reported previously that FGF-9 contains an uncleaved signal sequence that involves both its N-terminal region and central hydrophobic region (20Miyakawa K. Hatsuzawa K. Kurokawa T. Asada M. Kuroiwa T. Imamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29352-29357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, this understanding was challenged by another study, which suggested that the N terminus of FGF-9 is sufficient, by itself, to mediate secretion (21Revest J.M. DeMoerlooze L. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The primary structure of FGF-16 shows 73% identity with that of FGF-9 (18Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is expressed mainly in embryonic brown adipose tissue and adult heart and, once secreted, has a mitogenic effect on primary brown adipocytes, which it exerts by binding to and activating FGFR-4 on the plasma membrane (22Konishi M. Mikami T. Yamasaki M. Miyake A. Itoh N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12119-12122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the mechanism and structural requirements for the secretion of FGF-16. Construction of cDNAs—The full-length FGF-16 cDNA was isolated after reverse transcription of total RNA from adult rat heart and then subcloned into eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(–) (Invitrogen Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan). The cDNAs for three N-terminal FGF-16 deletion mutants (i.e. FGF-16Δ10 (aa 11–207), FGF-16Δ15 (aa 16–207), and FGF-16Δ27 (aa 28–207)) were generated from FGF-16/pcDNA3.1 by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(–). PL and PPL were amplified from bovine PPL (23Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) by PCR and respectively subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(–). Six FGF-16-PL chimeras (i.e. FGF-16-(1–27)-PL (FGF-16 (aa 1–27) and PL (aa 1–229)), FGF-16-(1–57)-PL (FGF-16 (aa 1–57) and PL (aa 1–229)), FGF-16-(1–83)-PL (FGF-16 (aa 1–83) and PL (aa 1–229)), FGF-16-(1–27)-PPL (FGF-16 (aa 1–27) and PPL (aa 31–229)), FGF-16-(1–57)-PPL (FGF-16 (aa 1–27) and PPL (aa 31–229)), and FGF-16-(1–83)-PPL (FGF-16 (aa 1–83) and PPL (aa 31–229)) were then generated by amplifying the respective fragments of FGF-16 and PL by PCR, ligating the two fragments, and subcloning them into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(–). The cDNAs for four FGF-16 point mutants (i.e. FGF-16(V4N), FGF-16(V7N), FGF-16(I97N), and FGF-16(L99N,A100N)) were constructed by using the overlap extension PCR method (24Urban A. Neukirchen S. Jaeger K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2227-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Generated fragments were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(–). All nucleotide sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer, Applied Biosystems Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When used for the isolation of selected proteins, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with 50 μg of plasmid DNA construct using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen Japan K.K.). When used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence studies, the cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA construct using SuperFect, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen K.K., Tokyo, Japan). Detection of Secreted FGF-16 Protein—Twenty-four hours after transfection of FGF-16 cDNA into COS-1 cells, the conditioned medium was collected, cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, and loaded onto a Hi-Trap heparin HP column (Amersham Biosciences K.K., Tokyo Japan) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.01% CHAPS (PBS-C). The column was then washed with 10 column volumes of PBS-C and run with a linear NaCl gradient (0–2.0 m) in PBS-C. The proteins in the fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, fixed, and stained using Quick-CBB according to the manufacturer's instructions (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Forty-eight hours after transfection, the COS-1 transfectants were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with or without brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan) and then metabolically labeled for 15 min with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Japan, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in 1.0 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich Japan K.K.). After the labeling, the cells were rinsed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with unlabeled methionine and cysteine and then incubated in 1.0 ml of the same medium for various times at 37 °C. The conditioned medium was saved, and the cell proteins were extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Samples were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, incubated with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody overnight at 4 °C, and then incubated again with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The beads were then washed twice in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer at 4 °C, and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed for 30 min and dried, and the radio images were captured using BAS 2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Immunoblotting and Deglycosylation—To obtain secreted proteins, medium conditioned by COS-1 transfectants expressing FGF-16-Myc-His or one of the FGF-16 mutants was collected, cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen K.K.) at 4 °C overnight. The proteins bound to the beads were then retrieved according to the manufacturer's instructions. Digestion of the protein samples with N-glycosidase F (glycopeptidase F, Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) or endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain cell-associated proteins, the transfectants were rinsed with PBS, treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice, and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with sonication. The Myc-His-tagged proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then blotted with mouse monoclonal anti-His5 antibody (Qiagen K.K.), and the signals were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) and an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences K.K.). Immunocytochemistry—Forty eight hours after transfection, COS-1 transfectants on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 6 min at room temperature. First, the cells were incubated for 1 h with a mixture of polyclonal rabbit anti-c-Myc antibody (1:50 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal mouse anti-Golgi-58K antibody (1:50 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich Japan K.K.). Then, after washing, the cells were incubated for 30 min with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (1:50 dilution; Amersham Biosciences K.K.) and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:800 dilution; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). The cells were observed under a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, invert mode). FGF-16 Protein Is Secreted as an N-Glycosylated Form without Predictable Signal Cleavage—In an earlier study, Miyake et al. (18Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) showed that tagged rat FGF-16 is secreted from insect Sf9 cells transfected with its cDNA. Our first aim was to confirm secretion from FGF-16 from the mammalian COS-1 cell line (Fig. 1, A and B). cDNAs encoding FGF-16 (Fig. 1C) with or without a C-terminal Myc-His6 tag were expressed in COS-1 cells, after which post-heparin-Sepharose fractions from the conditioned medium were examined for the presence of secreted FGF-16. We found that both intact wild-type FGF-16 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 4, and 7) and its tagged form (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 5, and 9) were secreted into the culture medium and that the addition of a tag did not affect secretion or heparin affinity (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 4 and 5). Analysis of equal aliquots of cell lysate and conditioned medium from COS-1 transfectants expressing FGF-16-Myc-His6 confirmed the secretion of FGF-16 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Notably, FGF-16 was detected in the cell lysate mainly in a 30-kDa form, which is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of the tagged, full-length FGF-16 (lane 1), and in a 34-kDa form in the conditioned medium (lane 2). Prediction of a signal sequence in FGF-16 yielded negative results. By using SignalP-HMM software, which is available on the Internet (25Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar) and has a substantially greater ability to discriminate between signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors than its predecessor (SignalP-NN), FGF-16 was predicted to be a non-secretory protein (i.e. there was no predictable, cleavable signal sequence). We attempted to confirm that finding by directly sequencing the N terminus of the secreted FGF-16 protein present in medium conditioned by FGF-16-expressing COS-1 cells, but we found that the N terminus of the secreted FGF-16 was blocked. Still, treatment of the 34-kDa-secreted FGF-16 with N-glycosidase F yielded a 30-kDa form (Fig. 1B, lane 3, black arrow), suggesting that the 34-kDa form was composed of a 30-kDa simple polypeptide modified with a 4-kDa N-linked glycan. The only possible N-glycosylation site within the FGF-16 primary structure is the sequence Asn78-Gly79-Thr80, which, consistent with the idea that FGF-16 is not cleaved upon its secretion from cells, precedes the central hydrophobic region (Fig. 1C). Secretion of FGF-16 Is Potently Inhibited by Brefeldin A—In mammalian cells, most proteins with conventional signal sequences are secreted by means of the ER and Golgi apparatus. To determine whether FGF-16 makes use of the same secretion pathway, we investigated whether the secretion of FGF-16 was affected by brefeldin A, which accentuates the retrograde transport of Golgi components (proteins and lipids) to the ER, thereby causing disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and inhibition of protein secretion (26Chardin P. McCormick F. Cell. 1999; 97: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). When COS-1 transfectants expressing FGF-16 were labeled with [35S]Met/[35S]Cys and then incubated for various times in the presence of 25 μg/ml brefeldin A, FGF-16 secretion was potently inhibited (Fig. 2). Both the N Terminus and Central Hydrophobic Region of FGF-16 Are Required for the Secretion, but the Hydrophobicity of the N Terminus Is Not—Although N-terminal signal sequences typically include a strongly hydrophobic region, the N-terminal region of FGF-16 does not (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the N-terminal region is necessary nevertheless to the secretion of FGF-16, we expressed in COS-1 cells three serial FGF-16 N-terminal deletion mutants tagged with Myc-His6 at their C termini (to enable immunological detection) (Fig. 3A). Deletion of the first 15 or 27 amino acids caused a profound reduction in the secretion of FGF-16 (Fig. 3B, lanes 9 and 10, respectively), as compared with the full-length protein (lane 6). Apparently, the N-terminal region of FGF-16 is indispensable for its secretion, despite its lack of a strongly hydrophobic region. To determine whether the N terminus of FGF-16 can, itself, function as a signal sequence, and whether it can affect the activity of a pre-existing signal peptide, we expressed in COS-1 cells a group of reporter proteins in which FGF-16 N termini of various sizes were chimerized with prolactin (PL) or preprolactin (PPL) (Fig. 4A). The selected N-terminal sequences (FGF-16-(1–27), FGF-16-(1–57), and FGF-16-(1–83)) all preceded the hydrophobic domain of FGF-16 (aa 90–110; hatched region in Fig. 4A). PPL/PL protein was selected for this experiment because both its secretion and the underlying mechanism have been well characterized. PPL is the full-length translation product of the prolactin gene; it contains an N-terminal signal sequence that is cleaved during the secretion of the molecule, yielding mature PL. There is no consensus sequence for N-glycosylation in the primary structure PPL/PL. Consequently, the sole N-glycosylation site is mapped to Asn78-Gly79-Thr80 of FGF-16 (marked by Y). We found that, irrespective of its length (27, 57, and 83 amino acids), the N terminus of FGF-16 was unable to serve as a secretion signal peptide for the PL chimeric proteins (Fig. 4B, lower panel, lanes 3–5); moreover, it did not obstruct the secretion and normal cleavage of the endogenous signal sequence of PPL (Fig. 4B, upper and lower panels, lanes 7–9). Interestingly, lysates from cells expressing the PPL chimera harboring the 83-amino acid FGF-16 N terminus (FGF-16-(1–83)-PPL) yielded 38- and 42-kDa bands in addition to the 26-kDa band representing the processed form of PL (Fig. 4B, lane 9, black, white, and hatched arrowheads, respectively). The 42-kDa protein disappeared after digestion with N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 4, white arrowhead), indicating that it was composed of the full-length 38-kDa simple polypeptide modified with a high mannose type N-glycan, almost certainly attached at the Asn78-Gly79-Thr80 glycosylation site in the FGF-16 fragment (Fig. 4A, marked with Y). Apparently, the N-terminal domain (1–86) of FGF-16 was translocated across the ER membrane along with the signal sequence of PPL, as such N-linked high mannose glycosylation occurs at the inside of the ER membrane. Moreover, the fact that FGF-16-(1–83)-PPL was readily secreted into the conditioned medium as plain PL (Fig. 4B, lower panels) indicates that the N-terminal sequence (1–83) of FGF-16 did not interfere with the signal sequence function of PPL. A strongly hydrophobic motif is distinctive of conventional N-terminal signal sequences of secreted proteins, and it is known to be important for translocation of secreted proteins across the ER membrane. Therefore, we examined the extent to which the hydrophobic regions of FGF-16 contribute to its secretion. Hydropathy plots of FGF-16 showed that its N terminus is weakly hydrophobic and that its central region is strongly hydrophobic (Fig. 5A). With that in mind, we constructed four FGF-16 point mutants in which local hydrophobicity was reduced by amino acid substitution (Fig. 5, B and C). Substituting Val4 or Val7 with Asn made the N terminus less hydrophobic, whereas substituting Ile97 or Leu99 and Ala100 with Asn made the central region less hydrophobic (Fig. 5A). Analysis of the medium conditioned by the respective COS-1 transfectants revealed that both FGF-16(V4N) and FGF-16(V7N) were glycosylated and secreted from the cells (Fig. 5C, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). By contrast, FGF-16(I97N) and FGF-16(L99N,A100N) were neither glycosylated nor secreted (Fig. 5C, lanes 11, 12, 15, and 16). Mutations at the N Terminus and Central Hydrophobic Region of FGF-16 Result in Very Different Subcellular Distributions—Because the biochemical data indicated that both the N-terminal region and central hydrophobic region of FGF-16 are important for its secretion, we examined how disruption of these two regions affected the subcellular distributions of the translated proteins. We found that, when expressed in COS-1 cells, wild-type FGF-16 was localized mainly in the perinuclear region and its distribution overlapped that of the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 6, A–C). Similarly, distribution of an N-terminal deletion mutant (FGF-16Δ27) in the perinuclear region also overlapped the Golgi apparatus, although this form was also observed in the nucleus (Fig. 6, D–F). In contrast, when substitutions were made in the central hydrophobic regions, the resultant mutants (FGF-16(I97N) and FGF-16(L99N,A100N)) were evenly distributed throughout the cytosol (Fig. 6, G–I and J–L). We have shown that FGF-16 secretion can proceed in mammalian cells, even without peptide cleavage. Like proteins with a cleavable signal sequence, FGF-16 was modified with an N-glycan and transported by means of the ER-Golgi apparatus. Although widely separated within the primary structure of the protein, both the N-terminal region and central hydrophobic region of FGF-16 were crucial for its secretion. The cleavable signal sequences characterized to date are located at the N termini of secreted and transmembrane proteins. Although signal sequences vary widely, they generally include a hydrophobic region of 6–15 amino acids that directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the ER membrane with the aid of a signal recognition particle (SRP) (27Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the central hydrophobic region of FGF-16 is recognized by the SRP during the secretion process. Among FGF family members, the primary structure of FGF-16 shows the highest identity with FGF-9 (73%). Hydropathy plots indicate the central hydrophobic region of FGF-16 is very similar to that of FGF-9, which Miyamoto et al. (17Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) showed contains an uncleaved signal sequence. Moreover, we observed that both the N-terminal region and central hydrophobic region of FGF-9 are crucial for its translocation into microsomes and secretion from cells and that the translocation was possibly mediated by SRP (20Miyakawa K. Hatsuzawa K. Kurokawa T. Asada M. Kuroiwa T. Imamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29352-29357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the other hand, based on their examination of chimeric proteins composed of FGF-9 N termini and green fluorescent protein, Revest et al. (21Revest J.M. DeMoerlooze L. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) concluded that the N-terminal 28 amino acids of FGF-9 were sufficient to function as an uncleavable signal sequence. Arguing against this interpretation, however, is the fact that the green fluorescent protein construct used in that study was secretable by itself; joining the FGF-9 N terminus to the N terminus of green fluorescent protein only enhanced that secretion. It was never demonstrated that the FGF-9 N terminus could, by itself, convert an otherwise unsecretable protein into a secretable one. We have shown in the present study, however, that the N-terminal region of FGF-16 is not, by itself, sufficient to function as a signal sequence when fused to mature PL lacking its endogenous signal peptide. Still, our observation of a unique FGF-16 (1–83)-PPL form modified with a high mannose N-glycan, which are immediately attached to proteins as they migrate into the ER (28Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3762) Google Scholar), indicates that the N-terminal FGF-16 region of the chimera had migrated into the ER membrane. The subcellular distribution of unsecretable FGF-16 mutants provides additional insight into the respective functions of the N-terminal region and central hydrophobic region in the secretion of FGF-16. Like that of wild-type FGF-16, the distribution of FGF-16Δ27 in the perinuclear region significantly overlapped the distribution of the Golgi apparatus. By contrast, FGF-16 mutants with less hydrophobic central regions (FGF-16(I97N) and FGF-16(L99N,A100N)) were evenly distributed throughout the cytosol. These results strongly suggest that the N-terminal region and central hydrophobic region of FGF-16 cooperate to enable its translocation into the ER during the secretory process. We suggest that the central hydrophobic region is important for concentration of the polypeptide in the approximate ER-Golgi region or for presentation of the polypeptide to the secretion machinery on the ER membrane and that the N-terminal region is important for the polypeptide to cross through the ER membrane. Other secreted proteins with signal peptides known not to be cleaved include plasminogen activation inhibitor (PAI)-2, ovalbumin (serpin family), and retinoic acid-binding protein. Both PAI-2 and ovalbumin contain internal hydrophobic regions to direct their translocation into the ER (29Belin D. Bost S. Vassalli J.D. Strub K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Lingappa V.R. Lingappa J.R. Blobel G. Nature. 1979; 281: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 31Tabe L. Krieg P. Strachan R. Jackson D. Wallis E. Colman A. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 645-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) where their hydrophobic N termini are not cleaved. PAI-2 relies on a bipartite signal sequence composed of two internal hydrophobic domains near its N terminus (29Belin D. Bost S. Vassalli J.D. Strub K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32von Heijne G. Liljestrom P. Mikus P. Andersson H. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15240-15243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second domain is recognized by the SRP, but both are required for translocation of PAI-2 into the ER (29Belin D. Bost S. Vassalli J.D. Strub K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). With regard to retinoic acid-binding protein, the N-terminal 17 amino acid residues are able to direct translocation of a heterologous fusion protein into ER; whether additional regions of retinoic acid-binding protein participate in this process is not yet known (33Bellovino D. Morimoto T. Mengheri E. Perozzi G. Garaguso I. Nobili F. Gaetani S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13949-13956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Despite these potential similarities, it is noteworthy that the distances separating the N termini and hydrophobic regions are much greater in FGF-9 and FGF-16 than in PAI-2 and ovalbumin. FGFs are a closely related family of proteins in which the amino acid sequences spanning the central core region are highly conserved. On the other hand, their N and C termini are quite divergent. Although many members of the FGF family contain a classical N-terminal signal sequence, several do not. The prototype members of the FGF family, FGF-1 and FGF-2, which primarily localize in the cytoplasm and cell nucleus, do not possess a signal sequence but are nevertheless released and have been visualized in the extracellular matrix of various tissues (34Abraham J.A.

The mechanism of their release is not yet completely clear, although FGF-1 is known to be released in response to heat shock (36Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and FGF-2 may be released through exocytosis (37Mignatti P. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), as evidenced by the fact that depleting cells of ATP inhibits its release (38Florkiewicz R.Z. Majack R.A. Buechler R.D. Florkiewicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). By contrast, although they lack conventional secretion signal sequences, FGF-9, -16, and -20 seem to be secreted by means of the same secretion machinery used by proteins that have them. As FGFs act both extracellularly and intracellularly (8Uruno T. Oki J. Ozawa K. Miyakawa K. Ueno H. Imamura T. Growth Factors. 1999; 17: 93-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 39Imamura T.

Science. 1990; 249: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), the structural basis of their secretion and distribution may be a key determinant governing the broad multifunctionality of this family of growth factors.

https://openalex.org/W1998064356,"We have described previously that, during S-phase, human DNA ligase I is phosphorylated on Ser66, a casein kinase II site. Here we investigate the phosphorylation status of DNA ligase I during the cell cycle by gel shift analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry. We show that three residues (Ser51, Ser76, and Ser91), which are part of cyclin-dependent kinase sites, are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of Ser91 occurs at G1/S transition and depends on a cyclin binding site in the C-terminal part of the protein. This modification is required for the ensuing phosphorylation of Ser76 detectable in G2/M extracts. The substitution of serines at positions 51, 66, 76, and 91 with aspartic acid to mimic the phosphorylated enzyme hampers the association of DNA ligase I with the replication foci. We suggest that the phosphorylation of DNA ligase I and possibly other replicative enzymes is part of the mechanism that directs the disassembly of the replication machinery at the completion of S-phase.

In mammalian cells, DNA replication takes place in specific subnuclear compartments, called replication factories, that contain the many enzymes and factors involved in this process (1Hozak P.

How these dynamic processes are controlled is still unknown; however, post-translational modifications of replicative factors are likely involved.DNA ligase I (LigI) 1The abbreviations used are: LigI, DNA ligase I; RFTS, replication factory targeting sequence; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; CDK, cyclin dependent kinase; WT, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Cy, cyclin binding site; 4A mutant, S51A/S66A/S76A/S91A; 4D mutant, S51D/S66D/S76D/S91D; Ala678–681, R678A/R679A/Q680A/L681A.1The abbreviations used are: LigI, DNA ligase I; RFTS, replication factory targeting sequence; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; CDK, cyclin dependent kinase; WT, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Cy, cyclin binding site; 4A mutant, S51A/S66A/S76A/S91A; 4D mutant, S51D/S66D/S76D/S91D; Ala678–681, R678A/R679A/Q680A/L681A. is responsible for joining adjacent Okazaki fragments generated during the lagging strand synthesis (11Tomkinson A.E.

According to its role in DNA replication, the protein is recruited to replication factories during S-phase (5Montecucco A. Savini E. Weighardt F. Rossi R. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G.

Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E.

A similar motif has been identified in a wide number of proteins involved in DNA replication (17Warbrick E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable to consider PCNA as the recruiter that controls the local concentration of many factors required for the proper DNA duplication. The RFTS/PCNA binding site of human LigI is located in the N-terminal region of the protein (residues 1–216) that, although dispensable for the in vitro activity, is essential for the function of the enzyme in vivo (18Tomkinson A.E.

In the same region are present several serines that are part of consensus sites for protein kinases and are phosphorylated in vitro (20Barnes D.E. Johnston L.H. Kodama K. Tomkinson A.E. Lasko D.D.

We have shown previously that human LigI is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner on Ser66, which is part of a casein kinase II site (23Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The functional role of this modification is still unknown; however, in vitro phosphorylation of human LigI by casein kinase II makes the enzyme no longer responsive to stimulation by PCNA (24Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24817-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Additional residues of human LigI undergo in vivo phosphorylation, and, in M-phase the enzyme exists in a hyperphosphorylated form that does not coimmunoprecipitate with PCNA (23Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The residues modified in the hyperphosphorylated form of human LigI have not yet been identified.In this article we report the identification, by electrospray mass spectrometry and gel mobility analysis, of three serines in the N-terminal domain of human LigI that are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. These serines are part of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) sites, are in vitro substrates of the cdk2/cyclin A complex, and their in vivo modification depends on a cyclin binding motif (Cy) located in the C-terminal region of the protein. Phosphorylation of one of these serines (Ser91) at the G1/S border is required for the appearance of the hyperphosphorylated form of the enzyme detectable in G2-phase. Substitution of these serines with the phosphoserinemimetic aspartic acid hampers the recruitment of human LigI to sites of DNA synthesis, supporting the idea that phosphorylation can be one of the mechanisms controlling the dynamics of replication factors during S-phase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Recombinant Proteins—All the human LigI mutants expressed in mammalian cells were C-terminally fused to the muscular actin epitope recognized by the HUC1-1 monoclonal antibody (ICN Pharmaceuticals) and were obtained with suitable primers and PCR-mediated mutagenesis of the pLigI-Tag plasmid described previously (5Montecucco A.

Plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing (Thermo Sequenase™ Cy™5.5 Amersham Biosciences). The substitution mutants S51A, S76A, and S91A are human LigI mutants in which serines at positions 51, 76, or 91 were substituted with alanine. S51A/S66A/S76A/S91A (which we call the “4A mutant”) and S51D/S66D/S76D/S91D (which we call the “4D mutant”) are mutants in which serines 51, 66, 76, and 91 were substituted with alanine and aspartic acid respectively. R678A/R679A/Q680A/L681A (which we refer to as “Ala678–681”) is a mutant in which residues 678–681, corresponding to the Cy motif, were replaced with four alanines. L(F/G)8,9 is a mutant in which phenylalanines at position 8 and 9 are substituted with glycine (14Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G.

ΔNLS lacks amino acids 119–131, corresponding to the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the protein (14Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Δ31–118, Δ132–216, Δ78–118, and Δ1–216, lack the corresponding amino acid residues. ΔRRQL lacks amino acids 678–681 corresponding to the Cy motif. ΔNLS/ΔRRQL lacks both the NLS and the Cy motif. Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotec AG (Ebersberg, Germany). To express human cyclin A fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), the cyclin A cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of the pGEX-2T plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame to the C terminus of the GST open reading frame. Recombinant His6-LigI and His6-Ala678–681 proteins were expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells by the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Invitrogen) according to the supplier. His-LigI/pET-11, a plasmid that expresses His-tagged human LigI in Escherichia coli, was kindly provided by Dr. Deborah Barnes, Cancer Research UK, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, UK.Cell Treatments, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence—HeLa S3 and COS7 cells were grown as described previously (10Montecucco A. Rossi R. Ferrari G. Scovassi A.I. Prosperi E. Biamonti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2109-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were synchronized in early S-phase with 2 mm thymidine (25Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Baserga R. Cell Synchronization. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 133-134Google Scholar), in mitosis with 40 ng/ml nocodazole (23Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and at the G1/S border by growing for 24 h in 500 μm mimosine (26Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cell synchronization was verified by flow cytometry. Transient transfection of sub-confluent COS7 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique with 10 μg of recombinant plasmid. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed for 4 min in cold methanol. Epitope-tagged proteins were detected with the anti-muscular actin HUC1-1 monoclonal antibody and the rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The size of the fusion proteins was verified by immunoblotting with the anti-tag antibody. In a typical experiment, the fraction of transfected cells was ∼8–10%. Sites of DNA synthesis were labeled with 50 μm BrdUrd for 30 min immediately before methanol fixation, and cells were processed as described previously (5Montecucco A. Savini E. Weighardt F. Rossi R. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5379-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was performed with a TCS SP2 digital scanning confocal microscope (Leica). We used the 488-nm laser line for excitation of FITC (detected at 500 nm < λFITC < 540 nm) and the 543-nm laser line for the rhodamine fluorescence (detected at >590 nm). For each construct, the percentage of colocalization with sites of DNA synthesis was determined by counting 200 BrdUrd-positive transfected cells in three independent experiments.Pull-down Assay—Expression of GST-cyclin A and GST proteins in E. coli XL1-Blue cells was induced with 0.8 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 37 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.03% SDS containing protease inhibitors and immediately centrifuged. The supernatant was mixed with 0.1 volume of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm EDTA for 1 h at 4 °C; unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.7 m NaCl. Beads were then equilibrated in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm EGTA). 50 μl of beads were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 700 ng of baculovirus-expressed His6-LigI or His6-Ala678–681 mutant in 100 μl of buffer A plus protease inhibitors. Beads were then extensively washed with buffer A without bovine serum albumin. Unbound and bound proteins were denatured at 90 °C in Laemmli sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and analyzed in Western blotting with the anti-LigI, Lβ polyclonal antibody (23Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used as a secondary antibody.Immunoprecipitation—A total of 4 × 108 HeLa cells were synchronized in mitosis with nocodazole, harvested, and lysed in 15 ml of cold immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After low speed centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with 200 μl of a rabbit anti-LigI antiserum. Beads were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer adjusted to 300 mm NaCl and twice with immunoprecipitation buffer. The immunoprecipitated material (about 5 μg) was then analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. In vitro transcription/translation of wild type (WT) and 4D proteins was performed using a TnT® T7/SP6 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) in the presence of 20 μCi of l-[35S]methionine, 1000Ci/mmol according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro translated WT and 4D proteins were incubated with 100 ng of recombinant PCNA (kindly supplied by Dr. Giovanni Maga, Istituto di Genetica Molecolare, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pavia, Italy) for 30 min at 4 °C. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-LigI polyclonal antibody (23Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation of PCNA was revealed with the anti-PCNA PC10 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Kinase Assay—For mass spectrometry, human LigI was overexpressed and purified from E. coli as described (28Mackenney V.J. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11550-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 10 μg of recombinant protein (rhLigI°) were incubated in 80 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm ATP) containing 50 mm NaF and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 2 μg of the recombinant cdk2/cyclin A active complex. Recombinant cdk2/cyclin A active complex was kindly supplied by Dr. Jerome Breton, Pharmacia Italia S.p.A., Nerviano, Italy. The specific activity (800 nmol/min/ml) was measured with the His9–18 peptide. To assess the role of the Cy motif in LigI phosphorylation, 4 pmol of baculovirus-expressed His6-LigI and His6-Ala678–681 were incubated in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 3000 Ci/mmol for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations of cdk2/cyclin A kinase. Reaction products were resolved on 7.5% polyacrylamide SDS gel (SDS-PAGE). Phosphorylation was quantitated by PhosphorImager (Amersham Bioscience). The 23-mer synthetic peptide used as a competitor in kinase assays was purchased from Neosystem, Strasbourg, France.Mass Spectrometry—Carboxymethylated proteins were loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and digested with trypsin or endoproteinase V8. Similar results were also obtained by digesting the immunopurified proteins in solution without loading them on an SDS gel. Trypsin digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C in 100 μl of ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 8.0, using 10 μl of enzyme (0.1 μg/μl). Digestions with endoproteinase V8 were performed for 2 and 4 h and overnight at room temperature in 100 μl of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, using 10 μl of enzyme (0.1 μg/μl). The products of digestion were separated by micro high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (Finnigan LCQ DECA, Thermo-Finningan Corp., San Jose, CA). Phosphorylated residues were identified by looking at the 80-Da increase in the mass due to the presence of the phosphate group.Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis of total cell extracts was as described previously (10Montecucco A. Rossi R. Ferrari G. Scovassi A.I. Prosperi E. Biamonti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2109-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence systems (Super Signal West Dura Extended, Pierce, for tagged proteins; ECL, Amersham Biosciences, for endogenous LigI and α-tubulin). Rainbow recombinant proteins (Amersham Biosciences) were used as molecular weight markers. To better appreciate the differences between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated LigI, SDS-PAGE were run until the yellow marker (75 kDa) reached the bottom of the gel. To verify that the wild type protein and the different mutants had the same apparent molecular mass when dephosphorylated, proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-tag antibody from extracts of transfected cells and dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase as described previously (23Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).RESULTSCell Cycle-dependent Modification of Human LigI—We have reported previously that phosphorylation of human LigI during cell cycle affects the electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme in SDS-PAGE (23Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed, three forms of LigI could be distinguished by Western blot analysis of cells synchronized at different moments of the cell cycle (Fig. 1A). Two bands are detectable in cells stacked at the G1/S boundary with mimosine. Entry in S-phase (release from a double thymidine block) is accompanied by the disappearance of the faster migrating form, suggesting that conversion of one protein band into the other takes place from late G1 to early S-phase. Finally a third protein form, showing a further reduced electrophoretic mobility, is detectable in M-phase extracts obtainable from nocodazole-arrested cells. We took advantage of the fact that the same pattern was detectable with the overexpressed protein (Fig. 1B), and we sought to analyze phosphorylation of LigI by studying the electrophoretic mobility of different mutants expressed in transiently transfected COS7 cells. The day after transfection, cells were synchronized at the mitotic spindle checkpoint by nocodazole and either collected immediately (M) or replated in fresh medium and harvested 6 h later (G1). Total cell extracts were then analyzed in Western blotting with the anti-tag antibody. We focused on the N-terminal regulatory domain of the enzyme (residues 1–216) containing several consensus sites for Ser/Thr kinases. The analysis of one of these mutants (Δ31–118) showed that the 31–118 region, comprising the already described casein kinase II site (66SEGE69) (23Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) along with three putative CDK sites (51SPVK54, 76SPAK79, and 91SPPR94), was required for the shift of electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1C). A different mobility in G1 and M extracts was instead detectable with a complementary mutant (Δ132–216) that lacked the portion of the N-terminal domain downstream of the NLS. Both mutants had the same subcellular distribution as the endogenous protein ruling out the possibility that any effect on the electrophoretic mobility could be due to inappropriate localization (23Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Further mutants narrowed the region required for the shift to a 41-amino acid stretch (residues 78–118) comprising only one putative CDK site at Ser91 (not shown). Replacement of Ser91 with alanine abrogated the shifts of electrophoretic mobility detectable in early S-phase and mitotic cells (S91A, designated A91 in Fig. 1D). Indeed the S91A mutant migrated as the fastest form of the wild type protein at the G1/S border (Fig. 1E, –). The difference in electrophoretic mobility between the wild type and the mutated LigI was caused by phosphorylation because it was abrogated by phosphatase treatment (Fig. 1E, +). Thus, the behavior of the S91A mutant indicates that phosphorylation of Ser91 occurs at the G1/S transition and is required for the appearance of the slower migrating form of LigI detectable in mitotic cells (see below).Ser91 Is a Substrate of Cdk2/Cyclin A and Is Phosphorylated in Vivo—The results in the previous section raise the possibility that the cdk2/cyclin A complex, which is required for S-phase progression, could be involved in phosphorylation of Ser91 at the G1/S border. To investigate this aspect, the enzyme expressed in E. coli was challenged in a kinase assay with recombinant cdk2/cyclin A and subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry. The results in Table I demonstrate that cdk2/cyclin A can phosphorylate Ser91 along with two additional residues, Ser51 and Ser76, that, as stated before, are part of CDK sites. We have also found that the same three serines are in vitro modified by cdk2/cyclin E (not shown). Although we applied different proteolytic conditions, peptides detected with mass spectrometry covered only 63% of the N-terminal domain, and additional phosphorylated residues could have escaped this analysis.Table IDNA ligase I phosphopeptides identified by electrospray mass spectrometryPeptidePositionPeptide sequenceProteolytic enzymerhLigI°41-54EWNGVVSESDS*PVKTrypsinrhLigI°63-79VLGSEGEEEDEALS*PAKTrypsinrhLigI°72-86DEALS*PAKGQKPALDV8 endoproteinaserhLigI°87-100CSQVS*PPRPATSPEV8 endoproteinasehLigI87-112CSQVS*PPRPATSPENNASLSDTSPDV8 endoproteinasehLigI74-86ALS*PAKGQKPALDV8 endoproteinasehLigI51-67S*PVKRPGRKAARVLGS*EV8 endoproteinase Open table in a new tab To verify the phosphorylation status of the three serines in vivo, about 5 μg of endogenous LigI were immunopurified from 4 × 108 mitotic HeLa cells and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry as above. Although the detected peptides covered only 49% of the N terminus, this analysis proved that the three serines were indeed phosphorylated in mitotic cells (Table I). Moreover, these data confirmed the occurrence of Ser66 phosphorylation, which was previously studied with a specific monoclonal antibody (23Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 exemplifies the analysis of a phosphopeptide obtained by in vitro phosphorylation of the recombinant protein (panel A) and a phosphopeptide obtained from the endogenous LigI immunopurified from mitotic HeLa cells (panel B). In conclusion, mass spectrometry analysis of the endogenous enzyme demonstrates that Ser91, which is involved in the shift of electrophoretic mobility at G1/S border (see Fig. 1E), is indeed phosphorylated in vivo.Fig. 2Analysis of phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry.

To investigate this aspect we determined the phosphorylation pattern of the WT and S91A proteins expressed in transiently transfected COS7 cells. After synchronization in M-phase, the two proteins were immunopurified with the anti-tag antibody and subjected to mass spectrometry. Contrary to the WT protein, the S91A mutant was not phosphorylated on Ser76, suggesting that modification of Ser91 was required for the successive phosphorylation of other residues of LigI. We used the mobility shift assay to follow the phosphorylation of Ser76 during the cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 1F, the S76A mutant underwent the mobility shift between G1/S border and early S-phase but not the successive shift between S- and M-phase. In nocodazole-arrested cells, the S76A mutant migrated faster than the WT protein (Fig. 1G), indicating that phosphorylation of Ser76 causes the slow migrating form of LigI detectable in mitotic cells. Differently from the other two residues, phosphorylation of Ser51 does not perturb the mobility of the protein (Fig. 1, H and I).Identification of a Cyclin Binding Motif in the C-terminal Domain of Human LigI—We have shown previously that LigI can be co-immunoprecipitated with cyclin A from a nuclear extract of HeLa cells (29Frouin I. Montecucco A. Biamonti G. Hubscher U. Spadari S. Maga G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the two proteins could directly interact with each other, we challenged the baculovirus-expressed human LigI in pull-down assays with a GST-cyclin A fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, LigI efficiently bound to GST-cyclin A but not to the sole GST moiety, and the interaction was stable up to 0.3 m NaCl.Fig. 3Human DNA ligase I is a substrate of cdk2/cyclin A.

However, no report shows the role of an RNA helicase in rRNA formation in higher eukaryotes. This study reports the functional characterization of the frog homologue of nucleolar RNA helicase II/Gu (xGu or DDX21). Down-regulation of xGu in Xenopus laevis oocyte using an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide results in the depletion of 18 and 28 S rRNAs. The disappearance of 18 S rRNA is accompanied by an accumulation of 20 S, indicating that xGu is critical in the processing of 20 to 18 S rRNA. The degradation of 28 S rRNA into fragments smaller than 18 S is also associated with a specific decrease in the level of xGu protein. These effects are reversed in the presence of in vitro synthesized wild type xGu mRNA but not its helicase-deficient mutant form. Similar aberrant rRNA processing is observed when antibody against xGu is microinjected. The involvement of xGu in processing of rRNA is consistent with the localization of Gu protein to the granular and dense fibrillar components of PtK2 cell nucleoli by immunoelectron microscopy. Our results show that xGu is involved in the processing of 20 to 18 S rRNA and contributes to the stability of 28 S rRNA in Xenopus oocytes.

Nucleoli are distinct phase-dense organelles inside the nucleus, the major function of which is to synthesize, process, and package ribosomal RNA (1Busch H. Smetana K. The Nucleolus. Academic Press, Inc., New York1970: 1-7Google Scholar). Additional functions have recently been assigned to nucleoli including production of signal recognition particles and transient sequestration of proteins involved in the regulation of gene transcription, cell cycle progression, and stem cell proliferation (2Pederson T.

Transcription of rRNA genes is thought to occur in the DFC and/or at the FC/DFC borders (8Hozak P. Cook P.R. Schofer C. Mosgoller W. Wachtler F. J.

This processing resembles an assembly line involving numerous proteins and small nucleolar RNAs. Ribose methylation and pseudouridilation of the 47 S precursor RNA, guided by small nucleolar RNAs, occur prior to nucleolytic cleavages (13Kiss-Laszlo Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.-P.

Final processing and assembly of the rRNAs, together with ∼80 ribosomal proteins, occur within the GC region and result in the formation of preribosomes that are eventually exported to the cytoplasm to become major components of the translation machinery (15Hadjiolov A.A.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Although the general processing pathway is conserved through evolution, the mechanism of rRNA production tends to be more complex when going from yeast to human. The process is better defined in yeast because of available genetic screenings (17Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 18Warner J.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 133-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Most yeast factors have mammalian counterparts but because a mammalian nucleolus is more complex in structure and function, not all nucleolar proteins in higher eukaryotes have yeast homologues. Furthermore, if a mammalian homologue exists, it cannot always reverse the mutant yeast phenotype. For example, mammalian nucleolin, a homologue of the yeast NSR1, cannot complement the yeast nsr1-Δ mutant (19Lee W.-C. Zabetakis D. Melese T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3865-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This shortcoming in the yeast system dictates that a different system must be employed to identify protein function.The Xenopus laevis oocyte offers an alternative system for functional analyses of proteins with advantages that include large size and convenient physical and biochemical manipulations. Factors that may alter gene expression are conveniently microinjected, and the oocyte fractions can then be analyzed.

Despite the convenience of using frog oocytes, details on the mechanism of rRNA synthesis in higher eukaryotes lag behind when compared with those in yeast. At least 16 putative helicases or DEAD box proteins have been genetically and biochemically implicated in yeast rRNA production (27Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), but none has been demonstrated in higher eukaryotes.A nucleolar protein hypothesized to function in the biogenesis of rRNA is RNA helicase II/Gu (Gu). We previously reported the cloning and characterization of mammalian Gu, a protein with 5′ to 3′ RNA unwinding activity (28Valdez B.C. Henning D. Busch R.K. Woods K. Flores-Rozas H. Hurwitz J. Perlaky L. Busch H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Flores-Rozas H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21372-21383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gu also contains a functionally distinct domain at its C terminus that is able to introduce secondary structure to single-stranded RNA (30Valdez B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6395-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We recently identified Guβ, a paralogue of the original Gu, which we now call Guα. The two proteins are products of structurally related adjacent genes on human chromosome 10 and may have evolved by gene duplication (31Valdez B.C. Yang H. Hong E. Sequitin A.M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 284: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The shuttling of Guα between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm (32Valdez B.C. Perlaky L. Cai Z.-J. Busch H. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) supports our recent report on the activation of c-Jun-regulated transcriptions by Guα (33Westermarck J. Weiss C. Saffrich R. Kast J. Musti A.-M. Wessely M. Ansorge W. Seraphin B. Wilm M. Valdez B.C. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The localization of Guα in the nucleolus and its RNA unwinding and annealing activities indicate a possible role in the production of highly structured rRNAs.To gain more information about the role of Guα in rRNA production, we cloned its Xenopus homologue. In this paper, we demonstrate that down-regulation of Guα results in aberrant rRNA production in Xenopus oocytes. This is the first report showing the function of an RNA helicase in the biogenesis of rRNA in higher eukaryotes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of the X. laevis Guα Homologue—Using the mouse Guα cDNA (34Valdez B.C. Wang W. Genomics. 2000; 66: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the EST Data Bank was searched for its frog homologue. This search resulted in two almost identical X. laevis sequences; both are homologous to the 3′ two-thirds of the mouse Guα cDNA sequence. The sequences were designated xGu-1 (GenBank™ accession number AF302423) and xGu-2 (GenBank™ accession number AF302422).To obtain full-length cDNA clones, a X. laevis oocyte cDNA library (Clontech) was screened according to standard protocols. A probe was prepared based on the obtained EST Data Bank sequences. BV602 (5′-ACCTGGCCGTGTGAGAGATCTTGTCCA-3′) and BV603 (5′-GATGAACATAAGCATCTGCTTCCTTTG-3′) were used to synthesize partial xGu cDNA from a liver total RNA using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The 600-nucleotide cDNA fragment was randomly labeled (50 ng) with [α-32P]dCTP using a RadPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). Prehybridization and hybridization of the membranes with the labeled probe were carried out according to standard procedures (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.52Google Scholar). Positive plaques were purified and rescreened according to the procedure that came with the cDNA library.Lambda phage clones were converted to phagemid using BM25.8 Escherichia coli cells. Phagemid DNA was purified and analyzed using EcoRI and XbaI. The clones with the longest inserts were sequenced. This screening resulted in the isolation of two clones with full-length xGu-1 and xGu-2 sequences.Isolation of Total RNA from Xenopus Tissues—Oocyte-positive human chorionic gonadotropin-tested female X. laevis were purchased from Xenopus Express. Different tissues were dissected from the frogs and stored at -80 °C. TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA from 100 mg of homogenized tissue. RNA samples were quantified spectrophotometrically, and the quality was determined by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis.Northern Blot Hybridization—A mixture of total RNA (10 μg in 5 μl of H2O) was treated according to standard protocol and separated on a 1.4% agarose-formaldehyde gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by Northern blot (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.52Google Scholar) using the same 32P-labeled probes. The analysis of xGu mRNA was done with the same 32P-labeled probe described above. The analysis of rRNAs used 32P end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides such as 18 S-5′ (5′-TTGAGACAAGCATATGCTACT-3′) and 28 S-5′ (5′-GTCGCCGCGTCTGATCTGAGG-3′). The level of 20 S rRNA was analyzed using a mixture of 32P end-labeled ITS1A (5′-CGAGACCCCCCTCACCCGGAGAGAGGGAAGGCGCCCGCCGCACCCTCCCCGCGG-3′) and ITS1B (5′-GCGGGCGTCTCTCTCTCTCTCCGCGGGGAGGGTGCGGCGGG-3′) as described previously (36Peculis B.A. Steitz J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1233-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Large scale preparation of oocyte extract was carried out by freon extraction to remove yolk protein as described (37Evans J.P. Kay B.K. Methods in Cell Biology. Academic Press Inc., New York1991: 133-148Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of this extract was analyzed by a colorimetric Western blot method using alkaline phosphatase.For small scale preparations, germinal vesicles were manually isolated with forceps and boiled in Laemmli buffer. The samples were loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and analyzed either by a colorimetric method or by a chemiluminescence detection system using an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences).RT-PCR—A One-Step RT-PCR kit was used to quantitatively analyze mRNA levels using the sets of primers listed in Table I. Each RT-PCR contained 100 ng of total RNA, 5 μl of 5× RT-PCR buffer, 5 μl of 5× Q-solution, 200 μm dATP, 200 μm dTTP, 200 μm dGTP, 200 μm dCTP, 0.5 μl of 10 units/μl RNAsin, 1 μl of RT-PCR enzyme mix, and 2 μm each primer in 25 μl of total volume. The RT-PCR was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min and at 95 °C for 15 min. Amplification was done at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min (30 cycles). The reaction was extended at 72 °C for 10 min. The RT-PCR products were analyzed in a 1% agarose gel, visualized under UV light, and photographed using the Eagle Eye II system (Stratagene). The intensity of the DNA bands was measured in pixels with the Eagle Eye II system. β-Actin bands were used as internal controls.Table IName5′ → 3′ sequenceGene1BV672AAGAACATAACAAGTGATGATxGu-1 onlyBV673GTTCCTCCGTAAAAACACGAG2BV646AAATCATCGATGCCCGGGAAxGu-2 onlyBV675TTTTGGACAAGATCTCTTATG3BV805ATCAACAACAATAATCCGACxGu-1 and xGu-2BV796AGAGTACAATACTACAAGGT4BV698GCACGAGCCGCATAGAAAGGAxβ-actinBV699ACTGGGTGTTCTTCTGGTGCA5BV809GAGGGAGTTCTTTTCAAAGAxC23BV810ATATGCAATCCCTTTATTTG6BV811GCTTTAGAAGATCTTGAATCxB23BV812CTTCCACTTTAGGAAGAACA Open table in a new tab Cellular Localization of xGu—A X. laevis kidney cell line (A6) was obtained from ATCC. The cells were grown on a chamber slide containing 75% National Cancer Tissue Culture 109 medium (Invitrogen), 15% water, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 26 °C. The cells were analyzed by double indirect immunofluorescence (38Perlaky L. Valdez B.C. Busch R.K. Larson R.G. Jhiang S.M. Zhang W.W. Brattain M. Busch H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 428-436PubMed Google Scholar) using anti-xGu and anti-xC23 antibodies. The antibody against X. laevis nucleolin/C23 (b6-6E7) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa.Expression, Purification, and Enzyme Assays of GST Fusion Proteins—The cDNA fragment of xGu-2 that encodes amino acids 2-800 was PCR-amplified using BV655 (5′-AAATCATGGAATTCCGGGAAAGTTTATACCGATGA-3′) and BV608 (5′-TTGGCATGTCTCGAGTCACTAACGGCCCTTCTAA-3′) and a phagemid containing xGu-2 cDNA. The PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the pGEX 4T-3 vector.Site-directed mutation of the DEVD motif to ASVD was carried out by PCR. The full-length mutant was also subcloned into the pGEX 4T-3 vector. All of the fusion proteins were expressed and purified described previously for GST-human Guα (28Valdez B.C. Henning D. Busch R.K. Woods K. Flores-Rozas H. Hurwitz J. Perlaky L. Busch H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).For RNA helicase assays, a partially double-stranded RNA with a 34-nucleotide duplex was synthesized from pBluescript vector as reported previously (Ref. 28Valdez B.C. Henning D. Busch R.K. Woods K. Flores-Rozas H. Hurwitz J. Perlaky L. Busch H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 8). Annealing of RNAs, gel purification of the substrates, and the helicase assays were done as described (28Valdez B.C. Henning D. Busch R.K. Woods K. Flores-Rozas H. Hurwitz J. Perlaky L. Busch H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Flores-Rozas H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21372-21383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, RNA helicase assays were carried out in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 0.1 m KCl, 2 units of RNAsin, 50 fmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded RNA substrate, and the enzyme fraction at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 5 μl of stop buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm EDTA, 1.3% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 42% glycerol, and 0.8 mg/ml proteinase K) to the 20-μl reaction mix, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to loading of 12.5 μl of reaction mix onto 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis at 100 volts, the gel was dried and analyzed by phosphorus imaging.Assays for RNA folding activity were done as described previously (30Valdez B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6395-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An [α-32P]GTP-labeled T7 RNA polymerase transcript from a HindIII-cut pBluescript II KS plasmid was synthesized, gel-purified, and dissolved in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.2 m KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. The single-stranded RNA substrate was appropriately diluted, boiled for 10 min, and cooled on ice just before using. RNA folding assay was done in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 2 units of RNAsin, 100 fmol of 32P-labeled ssRNA substrate and enzyme fraction at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of stop buffer and analyzed as described above for helicase assay.Production of Anti-xGu Antibody—The cDNA region of xGu-1 that encodes amino acids 245-759 (92% identical to xGu-2) was amplified by RT-PCR using BV609 (5′-AAGCTAAATGCTAGCCAACAGCCATTGGCTAGAGG-3′) and BV610 (5′-TGTTCGGACCTCGAGACGGCCC-CTTCTAAACCCC-3′) and 1 μg of frog liver total RNA using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). The amplified cDNA fragment was digested with NheI and XhoI and subcloned into the pTYB3 expression vector (New England Biolabs, Inc.).Protein expression was done by isolating plasmid DNA from the DH5α clone and transforming BL21-CodonPlus competent cells (Stratagene). The recombinant protein was purified according to the IMPACT T7: One-Step Protein Purification System protocol (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The purified protein was equilibrated overnight against a dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and sent to Rockland, Inc. for antibody production in rabbit.Affinity Purification of Anti-xGu Antibody—A polyclonal antibody was raised against xGu-1 protein as described above. Affinity purification was carried out using xGu-2 protein to purify antibody that recognized both xGu-1 and xGu-2. GST and GST-xGu-2 were separately immobilized onto cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Sigma). The rabbit serum containing anti-xGu antibody was diluted 3-fold in 1× PBS and passed twice through a GST affinity column (1 ml) to eliminate nonspecific binding. The flow-through from this GST column was passed through a GST-xGu-2 affinity column (1 ml) twice. The GST-xGu-2 column was washed consecutively with 15 ml of 1× PBS, 10 ml of 1× PBS containing 1.8 m KCl (pH 7.6), and 10 ml of 1× PBS or until absorbance of the wash at 280 nm was 0. Bound antibodies were eluted with 0.2 m glycine (pH 2.2), and each 1-ml fraction was collected into a tube containing 0.4 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). All of the fractions were kept on ice, and absorbance at 280 nm was measured. Fractions with at least A 280 = 0.05 were dialyzed for 24 h against 1× PBS. The dialyzed fractions were concentrated using Microcon YM 30 (Millipore), and the protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit.Isolation of Frog Oocytes—Oocytes were surgically removed from a female X. laevis obtained from Xenopus Express and tumbled with 2 mg/ml type I collagenase (Sigma) in Ca2+-free modified Barth's saline medium (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4) at room temperature until most of the oocytes were free. The oocytes were washed thoroughly with this medium and stored overnight at 18 °C in a modified Barth's saline medium (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2).Microinjection of Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotides and Analysis of rRNA—Different antisense phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) with perfect complementation to both xGu-1 and xGu-2 mRNAs were used in this study (Table II). Stage V and VI oocytes were selected for cytoplasmic microinjection with 32.2 nl of antisense oligonucleotide (1 ng/nl). After 6 h of incubation at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline medium, the oocytes were microinjected with a mixture of 16.1 nl of antisense oligonucleotide and 16.1 nl of [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol and 10 μCi/ul). After further incubation for 18 h at 18 °C, the oocytes were homogenized in 50 μl of homogenization buffer/oocyte (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 200 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were extracted with phenol:chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol (25:24:1) twice and with chloroform once. Nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol. Total RNA equivalent to 1.5 oocytes was loaded per lane and resolved on a 1% agarose formaldehyde denaturing gel. Initial electrophoresis was done at 100 volts for 1 h and continued at 140 volts for 2 h. The gel was washed twice with water for 5 min followed with 10× SSC for 15 min. RNA was passively transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane with 10× SSC overnight. The membrane was air-dried for 30 min and exposed to a phosphorus imaging screen (Molecular Dynamics). The results were obtained by scanning the screen using STORM 860 PhosphorImager and analyzed with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).Table IIName5′ → 3′ SequencePosition relative to ATG of xGu-1BV786CGAGGTCCGCAGGTGACCAC−56 to −37BV787CCGGGCATCGATGATTTCTC−12 to 8BV788CTTGGGTAGAGGAGTTTCAG62 to 81BV789TTATTGTTGTTGATCTCTCC154 to 173BV790CTTGGATCTGGCTGCTCTCC250 to 269BV791TCTTTTCTTAGGAGCTGGTT422 to 441BV792ACAACATCTTTGCCACTGTA640 to 659BV793ACTAAGAAGTCAATTCCATC898 to 917BV794CTCAACTTGTTCGGAGAAGC1022 to 1041BV795TCCACTGTACACCTGAACTA1268 to 1287BV796AGAGTACAATACTACAAGGT1502 to 1521BV797CCAGTTGTTCTTTAATTGAT1947 to 1966BV798AAAGGTCTCCTCCCTCTTCC2173 to 2192 Open table in a new tab The 5.8 S rRNA was analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gel. A 4-8 S HeLa RNA fraction prepared according to Reddy et al. (39Reddy R. Li W-Y. Henning D. Choi Y.C. Nohga K. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as nonradioactive markers. After electrophoresis, the denaturing gel was stained with 0.2% methylene blue for 10 min at room temperature, destained with water, vacuum dried, and analyzed by autoradiography.Determination of Half-life—The oocytes were microinjected with 32.2 nl of antisense BV795 (1 ng/nl) and incubated in a modified Barth's saline medium containing 1 mg/ml cycloheximide to stop protein synthesis (40Gard D.L. Hafezi S. Zhang T. Doxsey S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the event cycloheximide did not completely inhibit synthesis of xGu protein, the microinjection of BV795 would contribute to the inhibition of such synthesis by degradation of xGu mRNA. Ten nuclei were manually isolated after incubation of oocytes for 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h and used for immunoblot analysis. Signal intensities were quantitated using a densitometer and ImageQuant software.Rescue Experiment—The full coding sequence of xGu-1 cDNA (wild type and mutant) was amplified using BV863 (5′-CTGGTTCCGCGTGGATCCATGCCCGTGAAGGTTTA-3′) and BV864 (5′-GTCACGATGCGGGAGCTCGAGTCACTAACGGCCCC-3′) and subcloned into the BamHI and SstI sites of modified pSP64(poly(A)) vector (41Li J. O'Malley B.W. Wong J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The inserts were sequenced to prove absence of mutations. The EcoRI-linearized constructs were used as templates to in vitro synthesize xGu-1 mRNA using the Ambion MEGAscript SP6 kit. The sizes of the RNA products were checked on a formaldehyde-agarose gel. The RNA products were then used as templates for in vitro translation, and the resulting proteins were analyzed by Western blot using anti-xGu antibody.Stage V and VI oocytes were selected for cytoplasmic microinjection with 32.2 nl of 1 ng/nl BV795 antisense oligonucleotide. After 4 h at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline medium, the oocytes were microinjected a second time with 16.1 nl of in vitro transcribed mRNA (1 ng/nl) together with 16.1 nl of [α-32P]GTP. The oocytes were further incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline medium for 18-20 h prior to total RNA isolation and analysis as described above.Microinjection of Anti-xGu Antibody—Stage V and VI oocytes were selected for nuclear microinjection with 18.4 nl of affinity-purified anti-xGu antibody (1 ng/nl). After 4 h at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline medium, the oocytes were microinjected a second time with 9.2 nl of the same antibody together with 9.2 nl of [α-32P]GTP. The oocytes were further incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline medium for 18-20 h prior to total RNA isolation and analysis.Immunoelectron Microscopy—PtK2 cells (rat kangaroo kidney epithelial cells; ATCC) were grown as monolayers and prepared for Nanogold immunoelectron microscopy as previously described (42Ochs R.L. Stein Jr., T.W. Tan E.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 385-399PubMed Google Scholar) using a 1:1000 dilution of human serum containing anti-Guα antibody (28Valdez B.C. Henning D. Busch R.K. Woods K.

The amino acid sequences deduced from these two cDNA clones are 90% identical, excluding the 44-amino acid region present only in xGu-2 (Fig. 1). The presence of two Gu genes in X. laevis with 10% sequence divergence is consistent with the pseudotetraploid genetic make-up of this species (43Graf J-D. Kobel H.R. Methods in Cell Biology.

The minimum conserved GPI core structure of all GPI-anchored glycans has been determined as EtN-PO4-6Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN-myo-inositol-PO3H. Human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) has been reported to be a GPI-anchored membrane protein. AP carries one N-glycan, (NeuAcα2→3)2Gal2GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc(±Fuc)GlcNAc, and a GPI anchor, which contains an ethanolamine phosphate diester group, as a side chain. However, we found that both sialidase-treated soluble AP (sAP) and its GPI-anchored glycan bound to a Psathyrella velutina lectin (PVL)-Sepharose column, which binds β-GlcNAc residues. PVL binding of asialo-sAP and its GPI-anchored glycan was diminished by digestion with diplococcal β-N-acetylhexosaminidase or by mild acid treatment. After sequential digestion of asialo-sAP with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and acid phosphatase, the elution patterns on chromatofocusing gels were changed in accordance with the negative charges of phosphate residues. Trypsin-digested sAP was analyzed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and the structures of two glycopeptides with GPI-anchored glycans were confirmed as peptide-EtN-PO4-6Manα1→2(GlcNAcβ1-PO4→6)Manα1–6(±EtN-PO4→)Manα1→4GlcN, which may be produced by endo-α-glucosaminidase. In addition to AP, GPI-anchored carcinoembryonic antigen, cholinesterase, and Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein also bound to a PVL-Sepharose column, suggesting that the β-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphate diester residue is widely distributed in human GPI-anchored glycans. Furthermore, we found that the β-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphate diester residue is important for GPI anchor recognition of aerolysin, a channel-forming toxin derived from Aeromonas hydrophila.

Alkaline phosphatase (orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.1) is a glycoprotein that is widely distributed in the plasma membrane.

(Tokyo). 1988; 103: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported that the structure of the N-linked glycan of AP is NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα1→3(NeuAcα2→ 3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα1→6)Manβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→ 4(±Fucα1→6)GlcNAc, as derived by a combination of sequential exoglycosidase digestion and methylation analysis. On the contrary, the structure of the GPI-anchored glycan of AP was investigated by Redman et al. (8Redman C.A. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ogata S. Ikehara Y. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and reported to be Thr-Asp-EtN-PO4-6Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN-(sn-1-O-alkyl-2-O-acylglycerol-3-PO4-1-myo- d -inositol), with an additional ethanolamine phosphate group. However, the ethanolamine phosphate had been analyzed quantitatively by amino acid analysis and metabolic labeling method (19Ogata S. Hayashi Y. Takami N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10489-10494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study using a combination of β-GlcNAc-specific PVL-Sepharose column chromatography, LC/ESI-MS analysis, chromatofocusing, nitrous acid deamination treatment, and periodate oxidation, we found that not only ethanolamine phosphate, but also a β-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphate diester (GlcNAc-P) residue are present in AP and are positioned as side chains of its GPI-anchored glycan. GlcNAc-P has not been reported previously in GPI-anchored glycans, probably because it is easily hydrolyzed by mild acid treatment. We also investigated whether GlcNAc-P residues were associated with GPI-anchored glycans of human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cholinesterase, and Tamm-Horsfall (T-H) glycoprotein using PVL-Sepharose column chromatography. All of these glycoproteins carry both N-glycans (9Yamashita K. Totani K. Kuroki M. Matsuoka Y. Ueda I. Kobata A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3451-3459PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hard K. Van Zadelhoff G.

Because nonreducing terminal βGlcNAc residues were not present in their N-glycans, the GlcNAc-P residues appear to be linked to GPI-anchored glycans as a side chain. These results suggest that the GlcNAc-P residue is widely distributed on GPI-anchored glycoproteins of the human cell membrane. Aerolysin is a toxin released by Aeromonas hydrophila (13Lacy D.B. Stevens R.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Binding of aerolysin to receptors on target cells promotes receptor oligomerization, and this phenomenon is followed by membrane insertion and channel formation. Although GPI-anchored glycans of cell surface components have been reported to function as aerolysin receptors (14Cowell S. Aschauer W. Gruber H.J. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Mol.

Because proaerolysin, a nontoxic precursor of aerolysin, also has carbohydrate binding ability, we investigated the binding of AP to proaerolysin using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Materials—Pronase K, trypsin, wheat germ acid phosphatase, and NaNO2 were purchased from Sigma. NaB3H4 (490 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Diplococcal β-N-acetylhexosaminidase was purified from a fluid culture of Diplococcus pneumoniae according to the method of Glasgow et al. (18Glasgow L.R. Paulson J.C. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8615-8623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Acetylglucosamine and Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Preparation of Soluble Form of AP and Its Derivatives—sAP, which was converted from the membrane form (1Miki A. Tanaka Y. Ogata S. Ikehara Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was purified from human term placentas that were obtained within 2 h of delivery as reported previously (19Ogata S. Hayashi Y. Takami N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10489-10494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, sAP extracted from the membranes with 1-butanol at pH 5.5 was purified by sequential chromatography through ConA-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-300, and hydroxylapatite columns. Mild acid-treated sAP was prepared as follows. 10 μg of sAP was incubated in 50 μl of 0.01 m HCl at 100 °C for 30 min, to hydrolyze GlcNAc-phosphodiester linkages (20Tabas I. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6633-6639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the pH was adjusted to 7. sAP treated with acid hydrolysis and phosphatase was prepared from acid-treated sAP by incubation with a 20-μl slurry of bovine intestine alkaline phosphatase-immobilized beads (Sigma) after adjusting the pH to 8. PVL-Sepharose Column Chromatography—PVL was purified from the fruiting bodies of Psathyrella velutina as reported previously (21Kochibe N. Matta K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PVL-Sepharose (3 mg/ml) was prepared using the CNBr method (22Cuatrecasas P. Anfinsen C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 22: 345-378Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar). PVL-Sepharose columns were equilibrated with PBS containing 0.02% NaN3. Samples dissolved in 100 μl of PBS were applied to the column and kept at 4 °C for 15 min. Elution was started with 5 ml of PBS at 4 °C followed by 5 ml of PBS containing 0.3 m GlcNAc at room temperature. Enzyme Activity—sAP enzyme activity was assayed using the enzyme substrate, 6.7 μmol of p-nitrophenylphosphoric acid disodium salt, in 0.1 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. After stopping the reaction with 100 μl of 1 m NaOH, the released chromogen was measured with a spectrophotometer (EIA Reader, Bio-Rad model 3550). Following the application of 20 μl of human serum to PVL-Sepharose columns, cholinesterase activity in the fractions was measured using the ChE B-test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan). One IU was designated as the amount of enzyme which hydrolyzed 1 μmol of benzoylcholine chloride in 1 min at 37 °C. PVL-Sepharose Column Chromatography of CEA—The human colon carcinoma cell line CCK81 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C. Cells cultured on 60-mm dishes were treated with 5 milliunits of PI-phospholipase C in 1 ml of PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. 100 μl of the supernatant was applied to a PVL-Sepharose column, as described above. The CEA content was measured by ELISA using anti-CEA (23Ichiki S. Kuroki M. Kuroki M. Koga Y. Matsuoka Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1986; 77: 462-472PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. ELISA plates (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 20 μg/ml rabbit anti-CEA polyclonal antibody in 20 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.3, blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin, and then treated with sample. After washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, 5 μg/ml goat anti-CEA polyclonal antibody was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After further washing, AP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, 6.7 μmol p-nitrophenylphosphoric acid disodium salt in 0.1 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, was added, and absorbance at 405 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer. PVL Column Chromatography of T-H Glycoprotein—T-H glycoprotein was purified from 1 liter of pooled urine obtained from normal adults as follows (24Tamm I. Horsfall Jr., F.L. J. Exp. Med. 1952; 95: 71-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). 0.58 mol of NaCl was added to the urine, and it was stirred at 4 °C for 18 h. The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation, solubilized with distilled water, and dialyzed against distilled water. After centrifugation, the supernatant was freeze dried and dissolved in PBS. An aliquot of T-H glycoprotein was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels to check the purity. It showed a single band of 80 kDa corresponding to the molecular mass of T-H glycoprotein. One mg of the purified T-H glycoprotein was applied to a PVL column, and each fractionated T-H glycoprotein was measured using a protein assay (Bio-Rad). Chromatofocusing of sAP and Its Derivatives—Nontreated and treated sAPs were separated on a Mono P HP5/20 chromatofocusing column (0.5 cm inner diameter × 9.6 cm long) at 4 °C. After the column was equilibrated with 0.025 m histidine HCl, pH 6.2, 1 μg of sAP was injected onto the column. Elution was carried out isocratically with 10 × diluted polybuffer 74 (Amersham Biosciences), pH 4.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The effluent was monitored using a pH sensor, and sAP activities were assayed. The sAP isoforms, collected in 1 ml of the eluent, were digested with 10 μl each of Arthrobacter sialidase (5 milliunits), diplococcal β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (10 milliunits), or wheat germ acid phosphatase (10 μg) at 37 °C for 2 h. Preparation of 3H-labeled GPI-anchored Glycan from sAP by Nitrous Acid Deamination or Direct Labeling with NaB3H4 Reduction—One mg of sAP was digested thoroughly with 1 mg of Pronase K in 100 μl of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 2 h. The glycopeptides were dried and dissolved in 0.1 ml of 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 3.5. 100 μl of 0.33 m NaNO2 was added to the mixture, and this was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently 0.2 ml of 0.2 m boric acid was added, and the GPI-anchored glycans were reduced with NaB[3H]4. 3H-Labeled GPI-anchored glycans were purified by Dowex AG-50 column chromatography. In direct labeling with NaB3H4 reduction, 100 μg of sAP was reduced with NaB3H4 in 100 μl of 0.05 n NaOH at 30 °C for 3 h and separated from NaB3H4 by PD-10 column chromatography. 3H-Labeled sAP was digested thoroughly with 0.1 mg of Pronase K in 50 μl of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 2 h. 3H-Labeled GPI-anchored glycans were purified by Dowex AG-50 column chromatography. LC/ESI-MS of Trypsin-digested sAP—One mg of sAP was digested with 100 μg of trypsin (sequence grade, Sigma) in 100 μl of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 2 h. LC/ESI-MS was carried out using a CapLC system (Waters Corp.) with an Xterra MS-18 column (1.0 × 50 mm, Waters Corp.) and a ZQ mass spectrometer with an electrospray ion source (Waters Corp.). The eluents were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O (A pump), and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (B pump). The flow rate was 20 μl/min, and the effluent was monitored at 210–400 nm. The gradient conditions were 5% of B for 5 min, 5–25% of B at 1%/min, and 25–60% of B at 0.5%/min. The ESI voltage was set at 3.5 kV, the desolvation gas (nitrogen) temperature was 150 °C, and the ion source block temperature was 80 °C. Two scan functions were recorded simultaneously to detect molecular masses of sAP trypsin digests and fragment ions from sugars. The first scan function was from 70 to 2,500 atomic mass units in 2 s with the low cone voltage at 25 eV, and the second scan function was from 70 to 1,200 atomic mass units in 0.5 s with the high cone voltage at 70 eV. Solid Phase Binding Assay—Proaerolysin was purchased from Protox Biotech (Victoria, Canada) and was biotinylated by EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions, following which it was dialyzed against PBS. The binding of proaerolysin to AP was measured using a solid phase binding assay. ELISA plates were coated with AP at 10 mg/ml in 20 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, at 4 °C for 18 h. The plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.3, blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% human serum albumin, and then treated with biotin-proaerolysin in PBS at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, the plates were treated with avidin-alkaline phosphatase (Zymed) at 37 °C for 1 h. After further washing, AP activities were measured, as described above. SPR Assay—Binding kinetics and affinities were determined by SPR assay using a Biacore 2000 biosensor system (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). All analyses were performed on research-grade CM5 sensor chips (Biacore, Inc.). To assess proaerolysin binding to nontreated sAP, sialidase-treated sAP, acid-treated sAP, and sAP treated with acid and phosphatase, they were immobilized on the chips in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, at protein concentrations of 10 μg/ml, using the amine coupling kit supplied by the manufacturer (Biacore, Inc.). The surface density was 405 RU for nontreated sAP, 520 RU for sialidase-treated sAP, 620 RU for acid-treated sAP, and 510 RU for sAP treated with acid and phosphatase. Measurements were carried out in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20 (Biacore, Inc.) at 25 °C and at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. After analyte binding, surfaces were regenerated with 0.1 m HCl and a contact time of 30 s. Sensorgram data were analyzed using BIA evaluation version 3 software (Biacore, Inc.). Monosaccharide Composition Analysis—To determine the reducing terminal residue released from 3H-labeled sAP, 1 × 105 dpm of direct 3H-labeled GPI-anchored glycan was hydrolyzed in 100 μl of 4 n HCl at 100 °C for 3 h, N-acetylated, and applied to a SP0810 column (10 mm × 300 mm, Shodex). The eluent was 20% ethanol, and the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Periodate Oxidation—1.1 mg of sAP was radiolabeled with NaB3H4 to monitor the recovery of the following steps. sAP was digested thoroughly with 1 mg of Pronase K in 100 μl of PBS at 37 °C for overnight. The glycopeptides were dried and dissolved in 100 μl of 0.05 m acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 0.6 μmol of sodium metaperiodate, and the mixture was kept at 4 °C for 40 h in the dark. Excess oxidant was destroyed by adding 10 μl of ethylene glycol. After standing at room temperature for 1 h, 10 mg of NaBH4 in 500 μl of 0.1 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.5, was added, and the mixture was left at 30 °C for 3 h. After adding acetic acid, the reduced sample flowed through a column of Dowex AG-50 (H+ form) (2-ml bed volume). The eluates were evaporated, and the sample was freed from boric acid by repeated evaporation with methanol. The sample was then hydrolyzed in 1 ml of 2 n HCl at 100 °C for 2 h and thoroughly dried up. The sample was radiolabeled with NaB3H4 in 100 μl of 0.1 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.5, at 30 °C for 3 h, and the excess NaB3H4 was consumed by 10 μl of benzaldehyde. After passing through with C18 Sep-Pak column (Waters Co.), the sample was evaporated and freed from boric acid by repeated evaporation with methanol. The oxidized oligosaccharide alcohols were then separated with paper electrophoresis. High voltage paper electrophoresis was performed by using pyridine/acetate buffer, pH 5.4 (pyridine/acetic acid/water, 3:1:387), at a potential of 73 V/cm for 40 min. The acidic components were extracted and digested with 50 μl of 1 mg/ml acid phosphatase in 0.2 m citrate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C overnight, then purified using ion exchange gels AG-50 and AG-3 (Bio-Rad). Then, the ascending paper chromatography was performed using the solvent butanol/ethanol/water (4:1:1) for 5 h. NaB3H4-reduced glyceraldehyde, erythrose, and mannose were used as standards. The developed paper was cut into 1-cm pieces and measured with a scintillation counter. PVL Column Chromatography of sAP and Its GPI-anchored Glycan—sAP has been reported to be a GPI-anchored membrane glycoprotein and has one N-glycan, (NeuAcα2→3)2 Gal2GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc (±Fuc)GlcNAc (7Endo T. Ohbayashi H. Hayashi Y. Ikehara Y. Kochibe N. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and a GPI-anchored glycan, EtN-HPO4-6Manα1→2Manα1→6Manα1→ 4GlcN-inositol-HPO4, which bears an ethanolamine phosphate group as a side chain (8Redman C.A. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ogata S. Ikehara Y. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, we observed that asialo-sAP bound to a PVL-Sepharose column, which interacts with β-Gl-cNAc residues (21Kochibe N. Matta K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and was eluted with 0.3 m GlcNAc (Fig. 1A). Because all the N-glycans of asialo-sAP are galactosylated, nonreducing terminal β-GlcNAc residues must be present in the GPI-anchored glycan of sAP. To determine how the β-GlcNAc residue is attached as a side chain of the GPI-anchored glycan, several analytical methods were applied. After Pronase digestion of sAP, glucosamine residues in GPI-anchored glycopeptides were deaminated by nitrous acid treatment and reduced with NaB3H4. [3H]Anhydromannitol was confirmed by monosaccharide composition analysis (data not shown). The 3H-labeled GPI-anchored glycopeptides also bound to a PVL column and were eluted with 0.3 m GlcNAc (Fig. 2A). The PVL binding ability of 3H-labeled GPI-anchored glycopeptides was abolished by digestion with diplococcal β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Fig. 2B). Mild acid hydrolysates of 3H-labeled GPI-anchored glycopeptides also failed to bind the PVL column (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the β-Glc-NAc residue does not bind to GPI-anchored glycopeptides via O-glycosidic bonding. Because N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphate diesters can be easily hydrolyzed by mild acid treatment (20Tabas I. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6633-6639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the existence of a GlcNAcβ1→phosphodiester residue (Gl-cNAc-P) as a GPI-anchored glycan side chain was suggested. Because 3H-labeled GPI-anchored glycopeptides were easily adsorbed to paper or to a high performance liquid chromatography column, we investigated whether asialo-AP itself contained a GlcNAc-P residue. Chromatofocusing of sAP—sAP used in this study flowed through a RCA-I-agarose column, indicating that all N-acetyllactosamine moieties within its glycan are replaced by sialic acid. Purified sAP was eluted from the chromatofocusing column at pH 4.6 (peak a) and pH 4.8 (peak b), as shown in Fig. 3A. sAP forms a homodimer and contains 4 mol of sialic acid/molecule (7Endo T. Ohbayashi H. Hayashi Y. Ikehara Y. Kochibe N. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because sialidase-treated APs were eluted at pH 5.2 and 5.0 (Fig. 3, B and E), one negatively charged sialic acid corresponded to an approximate ΔpH of 0.1. Asialo-sAPs were resistant to wheat germ acid phosphatase. However, after digestion with diplococcal β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, sAPs were eluted at pH 5.0 and 4.8 (Fig. 3, C and F). It was suggested that the negative charges exposed by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase digestion contribute to the delay in retention time. Subsequent to that digestion step, sAPs were digested thoroughly by wheat germ acid phosphatase and were eluted at pH 5.4 and 5.2 (Fig. 3, D and G), suggesting that they had lost their negatively charged phosphate residues. Mass spectroscopy indicated that the GPI-anchored glycan consisted of two isoforms, one with and one without an ethanolamine phosphate. Because ethanolamine phosphate diester has a single negative charge at pH 5.0, isoform b must contain both a GlcNAc-P residue and ethanolamine phosphate as side chains, whereas isoform a contains only the GlcNAc-P residue. These results suggested that β-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphate binds to the GPI-anchored glycans of AP. LC/ESI-MS of Trypsin-digested sAP—To confirm the structures of the sAP GPI-anchored glycans, LC/ESI-MS analysis was applied. Trypsin-digested sAP was analyzed by LC/ESI-MS with an Xterra MS-18 column using trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile as an eluent. The total ion chromatogram, which is presented in Fig. 4A, showed the respective peptides and GPI-anchored glycans corresponding to trypsin-digested sAP. Peaks c and d, at retention times 25.9 and 61.3 min, were assumed to represent peptides containing GPI-anchored glycans from the mass chromatograms monitored at m/z 79, 162, and 447 (Fig. 4, B, C, and D), which are characteristic fragment ions, HPO4high–, GlcN+, and (EtN-PO4high–)Man-GlcN+, derived from GPI anchors. From the mass spectra of peak c (Fig. 4B), the observed molecular masses of peak c were deduced as 3,033 and 3,156 Da. When the cone voltage of peak c was increased to 70 eV, several fragment ions were obtained from the GPI-anchored glycan (Fig. 4C). These were assigned as GlcN (m/z 161.9), Man-PO4-EtN (m/z 286.1), PO4-Man-GlcN (m/z 404.1), EtN-PO4-Man-GlcN (m/z 447.2), and PO4-Man-(PO4)-Man-GlcN (m/z 646.3). The detection of a m/z 646.3 peak indicated that β-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphate binds to the second mannosyl residue of the core structure. Accordingly, the peptide portion of peak c should correspond to a peptide comprising Ala466-Asp484 (1,980 Da). Although sAP was digested with trypsin (sequence grade), peptide Ala466-Asp484 was suggested to be digested by a trace amount of contaminating chymotrypsin. Because other sites, which can be theoretically digested by chymotrypsin, were not digested, it is possible that the Phe465-Ala466 site may be easily hydrolyzed by a slight chymotrypsin contamination. In fact, several charged positive ions of peak d in Fig. 4 were detected, and these were calculated to be of molecular mass 5,433 and 5,556 Da. Thus, they were assumed to represent peptide Gly443-Asp484 with GPI-anchored glycans carrying either GlcNAc-P or both GlcNAc-P and EtN-P as side chains, which should be theoretically released by trypsin (Fig. 4D). Thus, LC/ESI-MS analysis of trypsin-digested sAP suggested that the GPI-anchored glycan of sAP is hydrolyzed between GlcN and myo-inositol. To determine whether the reducing terminal residue is glucosamine, asialo-sAP was reduced directly with NaB3H4. Asialo-sAP, purified using a PD-10 column, was reproducibly tritium-labeled and the tritiated asialo-sAP bound to a PVL column (Fig. 5A). The radioactivity of the sAP Pronase digest was recovered in the PVL-bound fraction (Fig. 5B), indicating that the tritium-labeled glycopeptide must be derived from a GPI-anchored glycan. An aliquot of the tritium-labeled pronase digest was hydrolyzed with 4 m HCl at 100 °C for 3 h. After N-acetylation, the monosaccharide composition was analyzed on an SP0810 column, and this indicated that the 3H-labeled monosaccharide corresponded to authentic N-acetylglucosaminitol (Fig. 5C). These results suggested that the reducing terminal residue of sAP is a glucosamine moiety, which may be cleaved, between glucosamine and inositol of membrane-bound AP, by endo-α-glucosaminidase.Fig. 5PVL column chromatography of directly 3H-labeled sAP (A) and its GPI-anchored glycan (B), monosaccharide composition analysis of the reducing terminal residue (C), and paper electrophoresis at pH 5.4 after periodate oxidation (D).

Liang C.-J. Funakoshi S. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1283-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tritium-labeled GPI-anchored glycans were periodate oxidized, and the excess oxidant was consumed by ethylene glycol. After reducing with NaBH4, the products were hydrolyzed and then reduced with NaB3H4. When the [3H]-labeled components were seperated by pH 5.4 paper electrophoresis phosphorylated mannitol was not detected (Fig. 5D). These results indicated that GlcNAc-P is replaced at C-6 position of the mannose residue. If GlcNAc-P is replaced at C-3 or C-4 of the mannose residue, the periodateoxidized phosphorylated monosaccharide should be identified as phosphorylated mannitol. On the basis of the combined results of LC/ESI-MS, nitrous acid deamination, periodate oxidation, PVL column chromatography, chromatofocusing, and tritium labeling with NaB3H4 reduction, the structures of the GPI-anchored glycans derived from sAP were determined and are summarized in Fig. 6. GlcNAc-P Residues of Several Human GPI-anchored Glycoproteins—To investigate whether GlcNAc-P residues are also contained within other GPI-anchored glycoproteins, human serum cholinesterase, CEA, and T-H glycoprotein were applied to a PVL column. Most of these glycoproteins effectively bound to the column (Fig. 1). Because their N-glycan structures have been determined to be mature, at least to the point of incorporating N-acetyllactosamine residues (9Yamashita K. Totani K. Kuroki M. Matsuoka Y. Ueda I. Kobata A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3451-3459PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hard K. Van Zadelhoff G. Moonen P. Kamerling J.P. Vligenthart F.G. Eur. J.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 55-61PubMed Google Scholar), the nonreducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue of these glycoproteins should be derived from the GPI-anchored glycan. These results suggested that GlcNAc-P residues are widely distributed in human cell surface GPI-anchored glycoproteins. Proaerolysin Binding to sAP—Proaerolysin is a 52-kDa protein secreted by Aeromonas spp. and is a precursor of aerolysin, which is required for the virulence of A. hydrophila (13Lacy D.B. Stevens R.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All of the proteins that are known to bind aerolysin with high affinity are attached to the cell surface with GPI anchors. These include T-lymphocyte Thy-1, brain contactin, and variant surface glycoprotein of Trypanosoma spp. (14Cowell S. Aschauer W. Gruber H.J. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Nelson K. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22604-22609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, some GPI-anchored proteins cannot bind aerolysin because of species differences in modifications to the core structure (17MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22604-22609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether the GlcNAc-P residue of the GPI-anchored glycan is required for binding to proaerolysin, binding ability was measured using both plate method and SPR assays. In binding assays using plates coated with sAP or asialo-sAP, biotin-labeled proaerolysin bound to sAP and asialo-sAP in the same dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7, ▪ and □, respectively). GlcNAc-P residues were released from the GPI-anchored glycan of sAP by sequential mild acid hydrolysis and acid phosphatase digestion. Mild acid hydrolysis (0.01 m HCl at 100 °C for 30 min) should release both β-GlcNAc of GlcNAc-P diester residues as well as sialic acids of the sialylated biantennary glycan. The binding ability of proaerolysin to mild acid-treated sAP was decreased by approximately one-third (Fig. 7,•). Diplococcal β-N-acetylhexosaminidase digestion also affected the binding ability of proaerolysin in the same manner (data not shown). Moreover, the release of GlcNAc-P residues from sAP completely abolished its binding to proaerolysin (Fig. 7, ▴), although mild acid- and phosphatase-treated sAP showed the same molecular mass as that of intact sAP on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). These results suggested that the βGlcNAc-P residue in the GPI-anchored glycan is required for its high affinity binding to proaerolysin. The binding of proaerolysin to sAP was also assayed using the SPR method. To compare the binding of proaerolysin with intact sAP and treated sAPs, the surface densities of the immobilized sAPs were kept at ∼500 RU. Proaerolysin binding profiles to sAP and its derivatives are shown at various concentrations up to 300 nm (Fig. 8). Although the binding of proaerolysin to intact sAP and asialo-sAP increased in similar dose-dependent manners (Fig. 8, A and B), the binding to mild acid-treated sAP was decreased substantially (Fig. 8C), and the binding to GlcNAc-P-released sAP was extinguished (Fig. 8D). These results corresponded to those obtained using the plate method, and the KD value for binding of proaerolysin to sAP (5.6 × 10–8m) was similar to the KD values of Thy-1, variant surface glycoprotein, and contactin reported by MacKenzie et al. (17MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22604-22609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). These results indicated that GlcNAc-P residues of GPI-anchored glycans are targets of proaerolysin. A variety of membrane proteins are anchored to the cell surface via GPI (26Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All GPI anchors, from yeast to mammals, have the same core structure consisting of EtN-PO4-6Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcNH2α1–6myo-d-inositol-PO4 linked to a lipid moiety (27McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Using a hydrogen fluoride treatment method, which cleaves both GlcNAc-phosphodiester and ethanolamine phosphodiester, Redman et al. (8Redman C.A. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ogata S. Ikehara Y. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that AP also has the same core structure. However, we observed that asialo-AP bound to a PVL column that recognizes β-GlcNAc, even though the N-glycan structures of AP are (NeuAcα2–3)2Gal2GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc(±Fuc)GlcNAc (7Endo T. Ohbayashi H. Hayashi Y. Ikehara Y. Kochibe N. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated whether the GPI glycan of AP has β-GlcNAc residues. After sequential pronase digestion and nitrous acid deamination of sAP, the GPI-anchored glycan was labeled with NaB3H4. The reducing terminal residue was identified as 2,5-[3H]anhydromannitol (data not shown). Because the tritium-labeled GPI-anchored glycan of sAP bound to a PVL column, a βGlcNAc residue must be attached to this glycan. Moreover, its binding diminished after mild acid hydrolysis or β-N-acetylhexosaminidase digestion. If a βGlcNAc residue is attached directly to mannosyl residues of the core structure, it should not be hydrolyzed under mild acid conditions. It was suggested, therefore, that the βGlcNAc residue is linked to mannosyl via phosphate, as has been reported for lysosomal enzymes (20Tabas I. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6633-6639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the anomeric configuration of Glc-NAc-P was α. The results of chromatofocusing and LC/ESI-MS analysis in this study confirmed the existence of a βGlcNAc-P residue as a side chain of the GPI-anchored glycan. The presence of GlcNAc-P residues in GPI-anchored glycans may be a common feature not only of human proteins but also of various mammalian, yeast, and fish proteins because various GPI-anchored glycoproteins bound to a PVL-Sepharose column and were eluted with 0.3 m GlcNAc (data not shown). Moreover, it was demonstrated by LC/ESI-MS analysis that sAP is cleaved between glucosamine and inositol. These results suggest that GPI-anchored AP in human placenta is not hydrolyzed by PI-phospholipase C or D but by an endo-α-glucosaminidase, although this enzyme remains to be identified. We are currently investigating whether this enzyme exists on the plasma membrane of human placental cells. Although GPI-anchored glycans of surface glycoproteins had been reported to function as aerolysin receptors (28Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Pleshak E.N. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2355-2366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the precise carbohydrate binding specificity remained unclear. We have demonstrated in this paper that the GlcNAc-P residue in the GPI-anchored glycan is a high affinity determinant for aerolysin binding. Hong et al. (29Hong Y. Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kang J.Y. Shime H. Horiguchi Y. van der Goot F. Sugimoto N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5047-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) also reported that N-glycans on GPI-anchored proteins influence aerolysin binding (29Hong Y. Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kang J.Y. Shime H. Horiguchi Y. van der Goot F. Sugimoto N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5047-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but at least biantennary sugar chains of sAP were not bound to proaerolysin in our data. Although β-linked GlcNAc phosphate is replaced at C-6 of the mannose, and mild acid-phosphatase digestion abolished the interaction between sAP and proaerolysin, the binding could not be inhibited by 10–5m mannose 6-phosphate, inositol phosphate, GlcNAc phosphate, or ethanolamine phosphate (data not shown). These results suggest that the minimum structure of the GPI-anchored glycan which is required for recognition by aerolysin is a larger sized component than mannose 6-phosphate."

The ligand motion within ba 3-cytochrome c oxidase from Thermus thermophilus has been investigated by measuring time-resolved step-scan Fourier transform infrared difference spectra of photodissociated CO from heme a3 at ambient temperature. Upon photodissociation, 15-20% of the CO is not covalently attached to CuB but is trapped within a docking site near the ring A of heme a3 propionate. Two trajectories of CO that are distinguished spectroscopically and kinetically (v CO = 2131 cm-1, t d = 10-35 μs and v CO = 2146 cm-1, t d = 85 μs) are observed. At later times (t d = 110 μs) the docking site reorganizes about the CO and quickly establishes an energetic barrier that facilitates equilibration of the ligand with the protein solvent. The time-dependent shift of the CO trajectories we observe is attributed to a conformational motion of the docking site surrounding the ligand. The implications of these results with respect to the ability of the docking site to constrain ligand orientation and the reaction dynamics of the docking site are discussed herein.

However, the different trajectories of the funneled photodissociated ligand in the docking site can be distinguished only through time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (2Lim M. Jackson T.A.

There is now a relatively good understanding of the ligand dynamics of photolyzed Mb-CO. To date Mb has played the role of a model system for determining docking sites and channels through which ligands enter and escape from the active site of proteins, establishing a foundation for their chemical dynamics (9Frauenfelder H. Sligar S.G. Wolynes P.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1598-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar, 10Frauenfelder H. McMahon B.H. Austin R.H. Chu K. Groves J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similar measurements in enzymes, for which activity may require the shuttling of oriented ligands to and from their active site, however, have never been reported either under physiological conditions or at cryogenic temperatures. In addition to activating O2 and conserving the energy of the O2 reduction for subsequent ATP synthesis, ba 3-cytochrome c oxidase is able to catalyze the reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (N2O) under reducing anaerobic conditions (12Giuffrè A. Stubauer G. Sarti P. Brunori M. Zumft W.G. Buse G. Soulimane T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14718-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of reaction in such complex systems, it is crucial to probe in detail the intermediates along the reaction pathway. The time evolution and the trajectories of ligand binding intermediates can be monitored by time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy providing profound information on whether ligands gain access to the binding sites through specific channels and docking sites or by random diffusion through the protein matrix. Such measurements would enable us to address some new issues regarding the properties of the docking sites that may function to discriminate between ligands such as O2, NO, and CO. The crystal structure of cytochrome ba 3 indicates that subunit I consists of a low spin heme b and a high spin heme a3/CuB binuclear center, where the dioxygen and nitric oxide reactions take place (13Soulimane T. Buse G. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Than M.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1766-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Subunit II contains a homodinuclear copper complex. The CO ligation-release mechanism in cytochrome ba 3 follows that found in other heme-copper oxidases (14Woodruff W.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Giuffrè A. Forte E. Antonini G. D'Itri E. Brunori M. Soulimane T. Buse G.

Forte E. Antonini G. D'Itri E. Brunori M. Soulimane T. Buse G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which is 30-fold greater than that of the bovine aa 3. The CuB+-CO complex (Complex A) is not photolabile (17Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and thus it remains a bystander in the photodynamic events happening to Complex B. In the latter event, 80-85% of the photolyzed CO binds to CuB, whereas the other 15-20% migrates to a specific docking site and subsequently diffuses to protein channels prior to its rebinding to heme a3. The rate of decay of the transient CuB+-CO complex is 34.3 s-1, and rebinding to heme a3 occurs with k 2 = 29.5 s-1 (17Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol.

Time-resolved step-scan FTIR (TRS2-FTIR) spectra can now be unambiguously interpreted to yield specific information concerning the docking sites and their respective dynamic behavior in heme-copper oxidases. These observations may be made at room temperature under physiologically relevant conditions. In the work presented here, we have continued our TRS2-FTIR approach to heme-copper oxidases (19Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol.

In analogy to Mb studies, the results demonstrate the formation of the B1 and B0 states that are associated with the photolyzed CO within the docking site of ba 3-cytochrome c oxidase. Cytochrome ba 3 was isolated from Thermus thermophilus HB8 cells according to previously published procedures (15Giuffrè A. Forte E. Antonini G. D'Itri E. Brunori M. Soulimane T. Buse G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until further use. The samples used for the FTIR measurements had an enzyme concentration of ∼1 mm and were placed in MES buffer (pH 5.25) or in HEPES buffer (pD 7.50). The fully reduced enzyme was prepared by addition of dithionite after cycling the samples five times between vacuum and Ar. Dithionite-reduced samples were exposed to 1 atm CO (1 mm) in an anaerobic cell to prepare the carbonmonoxy adduct and transferred to a tightly sealed FTIR cell composed of two 3-mm-thick CaF2 windows under anaerobic conditions. The path length was sufficiently small (15 μm) to avoid strong absorbance of the water around 1650 cm-1 and keep the response of the mercury cadmium telluride detector linear. The TRS2 experiments were performed on a system described previously (17Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 12CO gas (99.9%) and isotopic CO (91.6% 13C16O and 8.4% 13C18O) were obtained from Messer (Germany) and Isotec (Miamisburg, OH), respectively. Optical absorption spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lamda 20 UV-visible spectrometer before and after the FTIR measurements to ensure the formation and stability of the CO adducts. No sample degradation occurred during the time course of the experiments. For the sake of comparison with earlier work on Mb, we ascribe the 2131 and 2146 cm-1 modes we have detected in the TRS2-FTIR difference spectra of fully reduced ba 3-CO to the states referred to in the literature as B1 and B0, respectively (2Lim M.

Fig. 1 shows the TRS2-FTIR difference spectra (t d = 10-110 μs, 8 cm-1 spectral resolution) of fully reduced ba 3-CO subsequent to CO photolysis by a 7-nanosecond laser pulse (532 nm). The negative peak at 1976 cm-1 arises from the photolyzed heme a3-CO complex. The positive peak that appears at 2053 cm-1 is the C-O stretch (v CO) of CuB as previously reported (17Koutsoupakis K.

Concurrently with the formation of the CuB+-CO complex, a positive peak appears at 2131 cm-1 that persists for 35 μs subsequent to CO photolysis and is displaced by a peak at 2146 cm-1 at later times (t d = 85 μs). The TRS2-FTIR difference spectra presented here in conjunction with the reported extinction coefficients for heme a3-CO and CuB-CO (16Alben J.O. Moh P.P. Fiamingo F.G. Altschuld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) demonstrate that 80-85% of the photodissociated CO binds to CuB. The remaining 15-20% is attributed to the population of the 2131 cm-1 mode (see below). The frequency of the 2146 cm-1 mode that we observe is close to the free gas value of CO (v CO = 2143.3 cm-1) and exactly the same as that found in Mb characterizing the B0 state at cryogenic temperatures (22Alben J.O. Beece D. Bowne S.F. Doster W. Eisenstein L. Frauenfelder H. Good D. McDonald J.D. Marden M.C. Moh P.P. Reinisch L. Reynolds A.H. Shyamsunder E. Yue K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3744-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The 2131 cm-1 mode corresponds to the B1 state, in which the CO is funneled into a docking site near the ring A of heme a3 propionate of cytochrome ba 3.2 The time evolution of the B1 conversion to B0 is depicted in Fig. 1B. At 10 and 35 μs subsequent to CO photolysis only the 2131 cm-1 (B1 state) mode is present. A close inspection of the data indicates that this mode has lost most of its intensity at t d = 85 μs. As the 2131 cm-1 mode decays with time, another mode located at 2146 cm-1 gains intensity. At t d = 10-50 μs, the 2146 cm-1 mode is below noise level, but at 85 μs, it is clearly observed in the spectrum. This feature decays at t d = 110 μs, becoming “buried” in the background as free “solvated” CO. Importantly, the decay of the 2146 cm-1 mode occurs prior to rebinding of CO to heme a3 Fe. Fig. 2A presents the TRS2-FTIR difference spectra of fully reduced ba 3-13CO subsequent to 13CO photolysis at pD 7.5. The 2099 and 2084 cm-1 modes correspond to those observed in the 12CO photolysis experiment (Fig. 1) and remain unchanged when the experiment was repeated in H2O (data not shown). This indicates that the 2146 and 2131 cm-1 modes are not sensitive to hydrogen-deuterium exchange. A close inspection of the data presented in Fig. 2B indicates that the decay of the 2084 and 2099 cm-1 modes occurs faster in D2O than in H2O and with reduced intensities. The unligated CO and its time evolution are clearly identified by the intensity of the 2146 and 2131 cm-1 modes relative to that of the bound CO to CuB (v CO = 2053 cm-1) and the 12CO to 13CO isotope shift. The intensities of the 1976 (photolyzed heme a3-CO) and 2053 cm-1 (CuB-CO) modes remain unchanged during the entire measurement associated with the 2131 and 2146 cm-1 modes, indicating that the binuclear center (heme a3 Fe/CuB-CO) remains a spectator to the CO events occurring within the docking site.Fig. 2Step-scan time-resolved FTIR difference spectra. A, TRS2-FTIR difference spectra of the 13CO-bound form of fully reduced cytochrome ba 3 (pD 7.50) at 10, 35, and 60 μs subsequent to CO photolysis. Enzyme concentration was ∼1 mm, and the path length was 15 μm. The spectral resolution was 8 cm-1, the time resolution was 5 μs, and 10 co-additions were collected per retardation data point. The excitation wavelength was 532 nm (4 mJ/pulse). The peak at 1883 cm-1 represents the 8.4% Fe-13C18O mode.

The 2131 cm-1 mode we observe is 12 cm-1 lower than the gas frequency of CO (2143.3 cm-1) suggesting a weak electrostatic interaction of the ligand with the protein. Furthermore, the sharpness of this feature denotes a well defined environment that accommodates the photolyzed CO. The 2146 cm-1 mode is slightly higher than the gas frequency of CO and retains the same bandwidth as that of the 2131 cm-1 mode indicating that the docking site controls not only the electrostatic interaction(s) of the “docked” CO during the B1 to B0 transition but also the degree of its rotation. Furthermore, the formation and decay of the B0 state signals the onset of CO release from the docking site to the protein environment. The ultrafast dynamics of CO motion subsequent to its dissociation from the heme of Mb at ambient temperatures have revealed the presence of the B1 and B2 states (2Lim M. Jackson T.A. Anfinrud P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Sagnella D.E. Straub J.E. Jackson T.A. Lim M. Anfinrud P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1999; 96: 8328-8329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The two CO trajectories were spectroscopically distinguishable due to the vibrational Stark effect that arises from the electrostatic field surrounding the ligand. The B1 and B2 states were resolved even at 0.2 ps with more than half of the vibrational Stark shift developed at that time (2Lim M. Jackson T.A. Anfinrud P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The center frequency of the B2 state (v CO = 2119 cm-1) appeared static from 0.2 to 10 ps; thus, it was concluded that the spectral shifting appeared to come only from the trajectory leading to the B1 state. In addition, from the surprisingly narrow band shapes of B1 (Δv½ = 9.1 cm-1) and B2 (Δv½ = 6.0 cm-1), it was suggested that the orientation of the docked CO is constrained by a static potential (7Lim M. Jackson T.A. Anfinrud P.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 102: 4355-4366Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It was finally concluded that the two B states correspond to opposite orientations of CO within the same docking site and that interconversion between B1 and B2 requires end-to-end rotation of CO (2Lim M. Jackson T.A. Anfinrud P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The B state spectrum of photolyzed Mb-CO at cryogenic temperatures (5.5 K), however, shows all three features that are denoted to B0, B1, and B2 states (22Alben J.O. Beece D. Bowne S.F. Doster W. Eisenstein L. Frauenfelder H. Good D. McDonald J.D. Marden M.C. Moh P.P. Reinisch L. Reynolds A.H. Shyamsunder E. Yue K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3744-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The absence of the B0 state in the 283-K spectrum was attributed to a conformational relaxation that occurs only under ambient temperatures. Obviously, the detection of the B0 state in our experiments demonstrates that such conformational relaxation, which prevents the detection of the 2146 cm-1 mode, is absent in cytochrome ba 3. The present μs TRS2-FTIR results provide clear evidence that the B1 and B0 states are formed in cytochrome ba 3, even though the corresponding states in Mb are formed in the ps time scale (B1 and B2) or under cryogenic conditions (B0). Although we do not detect the B2 state under our limited 5-μs time resolution, we cannot exclude the possibility that both the B1 and B2 states are initially formed and that conversion of B2 to B1 has already occurred in the μs time scale. The close correlation for the B1 state between the picosecond reactions of Mb and Hb and those of cytochrome ba 3 occurring in the μs time scale does not exist for the B0 state. Both the B0 and B1 states in cytochrome ba 3 have Δv½ ∼12 cm-1 indicating that the B0 state arises from CO that remains in the docking site. If the CO ligand corresponding to the B0 state had been laid outside the docking site as solvated, its detection would have been difficult because the spectrum of CO in H2O is too diffuse to be observed (5Anfinrud P.A. Han C. Hochstrasser R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8387-8391Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Lim M. Jackson T.A. Anfinrud P.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 102: 4355-4366Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Despite the close resemblance in the energies of the B1 and B0 states of unligated CO, between Mb and cytochrome ba 3 there are profound differences in the dynamic properties of their docking sites. An additional difference that is apparent between the properties of the docking site in Mb and cytochrome ba 3 is the lifetime of their B states. Both the B1 and B2 states in Mb persist into nanosecond time regime and decay simultaneously with half-time of 100-200 ns at room temperature (6Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17593-17596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In cytochrome ba 3, however, there is a thermal conversion of B1 to B0 state indicating that the docking site that shelters CO exhibits a conformational relaxation that facilitates the interconversion and subsequently the CO escape to the protein solvent. Consistent with this interpretation is the shorter lifetime of the B1 and B0 states in D2O, where conformational relaxation is most rapid. The long lifetime of the B1 state in cytochrome ba 3 as compared with that of Mb and the interconversion of the B1 to B0 state indicate that the docking site in cytochrome ba 3 consists of an environment quite different from that of Mb. In contrast to the Mb docking site, where the release of CO to the protein matrix occurs in a concerted manner by the simultaneous decay of both CO trajectories (B1 and B2 states), in cytochrome ba 3 the escape of CO from the docking site occurs in a sequential conversion of B1 to B0. A plausible explanation is that the rate of conformational relaxation near the docking site of Mb is much faster than that of cytochrome ba 3. The same docking site that shelters the photodissociated CO from heme a3 is expected to trap the thermally dissociated CO from CuB (k 2 = 29.5 s-1) as well as the thermally dissociated CO from heme a3 under non-photolytic conditions. The latter process occurs very slowly with a time constant of k -2 = 0.8 s-1. However, we found no spectroscopic evidence that the thermally dissociated CO from CuB is trapped within the docking site prior to its rebinding to the Fe of heme a3. We also expect the same docking site to trap any ligand having a size similar to that of CO, such as NO and O2, and expect the residues constituting the docking site to be responsible for the kinetic control of ligand binding and escape. The short lifetime of the B0 and B1 states in conjunction with the slow recombination of CO to heme a3 is not a consequence of a diffusional barrier created by the docking site, but it is rather due to steric restrictions directly adjacent to the binuclear center. In Fig. 3 we present a model for the ligand trajectory of the B1 state that is consistent with the time-resolved vibrational spectra of photolyzed cytochrome ba 3. The CO trajectory is illustrated at three different times: after photodissociation from heme a3; on its way to the docking site, in its transient binding to CuB; and finally, as trapped within the docking site. The detection of free CO in our experiments indicates that the CO transfer to CuB is a true bond-breakage and-formation process. Other studies have proposed, however, that in the absence of “free” CO the Fe-C bond starts to lengthen; thus, the influence of the CuB potential is felt by the CO. In this way, the formation of the CuB-C bond is rapid and concurrent with the Fe-C rupture (18Dyer R.B. Peterson K.A. Stoutland P.O. Woodruff W.H.

The TRS2-FTIR difference spectra reported here provide for the first time an incisive view for ligand motion within cytochrome ba 3 and show unambiguously the formation of the B1 and B0 states within a docking site. Taken together, the results demonstrate a facile pathway connecting the catalytic binuclear center and the docking site. Because the docking sites and their potential fields determine the discrimination in favor of or against ligand binding, the measured values of the unligated C-O can be used to predict the parameters of physiologically relevant ligands, such as O2 and NO. Experiments are in progress with emphasis on these questions. We thank Stavros Stavrakis for excellent technical assistance and Eftychia Pinakoulaki for helpful discussions."

It has been observed that the cleaved canonical sites stimulate SgrAI cleavage at the secondary sites. Equilibrium binding studies show that SgrAI binds to its canonical sites with a high affinity (K a = 4-8 × 1010m-1) and that it has a 15-fold lower affinity for the cleaved canonical sites and a 30-fold lower affinity for the secondary sites. Steady-state kinetics reveals substrate cooperativity for SgrAI cleavage on both canonical and secondary sites. The specificity of SgrAI for the secondary site CACCGGCT, as measured by k cat /K is about 500-fold lower than that for the canonical site CACCGGCG, but this difference is reduced to 10-fold in the presence of the cleaved canonical sites. The efficiency of canonical site cleavage also increases by 3-fold when the cleaved canonical sites are present in the reaction. Furthermore, the substrate cooperativity for SgrAI cleavage is abolished for both types of sites in the presence of cleaved canonical sites. These results indicate that target site cleavage occurs via a coordinated interaction of two SgrAI protein subunits, where the subunit bound to the cleaved site stimulates the cleavage of the uncut site bound by the other subunit. The free subunits of SgrAI have the flexibility to bind different target sites and, consequently, assemble into various catalytically active complexes, which differ in their catalytic efficiencies.

Restriction endonucleases serve as useful models to study the molecular basis of specificity in the interaction of proteins with DNA.

The Type IIS endonuclease FokI recognizes asymmetric sites and cleaves at fixed distances away from its recognition site. Although FokI binds DNA as a monomer (11Kaczorowski T. Skowron P.

Studies with NaeI reveal that the recognition sequences flanked by G/C-rich regions are preferred by the activator site, whereas the catalytic site prefers A/T-rich regions (22Yang C.C. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9657-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Conrad M. Topal M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9707-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the case of EcoRII, it has been shown that some non-cleavable or pre-digested recognition sequences can be bound at the activator site and stimulate the cleavage of refractory sites (27Pein C.D. Reuter M. Meisel A. Cech D. Kruger D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5139-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).The Type IIF class of restriction endonucleases, which include SfiI, NgoMIV, Cfr10I, and SgrAI, also interact with two copies of their recognition sequence, but unlike NaeI and EcoRII, they cleave both sites simultaneously (29Nobbs T.J. Szczelkun M.D. Wentzell L.M. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Diebert M. Grazulis S. Sasnauskas G. Siksnys V. Huber R. Nat. Struct.

Except for SgrAI, these endonucleases exist as tetramers of identical subunits and carry two active sites per tetramer. The tetrameric form seems to be the catalytically functional form, because a point mutation that converts the Cfr10I endonuclease into a dimer also results in almost complete loss of activity (31Siksnys V. Skirgalia R. Sasnauskas G. Urbanke C. Cherny D. Grazulis S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).The SgrAI restriction endonuclease, which recognizes a degenerate octanucleotide sequence 5′-CPuCCGGPyG (33Tautz N. Kaluza K. Jarsch M. Schmitz G.G. Kessler C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), also cleaves two copies of its recognition sequence simultaneously (32Bilcock D.T. Daniels L.E. Bath A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36379-36386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), placing it in the general category of SfiI-like endonucleases. However, in contrast to the SfiI-like enzymes, SgrAI was found to exist as a homodimer in a solution (34Daniels L.E. Wood K.M. Scott D.J. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the SgrAI endonuclease has been found to cleave effectively at a subset of less-specific sequences, 5′-CPuCCGGPy(A/T/C) and 5′-CPuCCGGGG, referred to as secondary sites (35Bitinaite J. Schildkraut I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 99: 1164-1169Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). DNA termini generated by cleaving at the SgrAI canonical site are a pre-requisite for efficient cleavage at secondary sites. To gain a better understanding of the reaction pathway of SgrAI, we have performed a detailed kinetic analysis of SgrAI binding and cleavage at various recognition sites.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymes and Chemicals—All enzymes, plasmid vectors, strains, and dNTPs were obtained from New England Biolabs unless stated otherwise. Labeled nucleotide triphosphates were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Novex TBE gels were purchased from Invitrogen. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite method by the Organic Synthesis Division of New England Biolabs. SgrAI restriction endonuclease was purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain carrying the cloned sgrAIR gene (New England Biolabs). All concentrations of SgrAI given here refer to the dimeric form of the protein with two subunits of M r 37,831.Substrates for DNA Binding and Cleavage Analysis— 33P-Labeled double-stranded (ds) 1The abbreviations used are: ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; K a, equilibrium association constant; Sinitial, substrate added to the reaction; K ib, association constant for competitor; n, Hill coefficient; k cat, turnover number; K, substrate dissociation constant; R 2, correlation coefficient; DTT, dithiothreitol. 30-mer and 80-mer oligonucleotide duplexes containing the canonical sites (CGCCGGCG, CACCGGCG, and CACCGGTG), secondary site (CGCCGGCT), and nonspecific site (TCTAGCAG) were used as substrates in the gel retardation experiments. These oligonucleotide duplexes were generated using adaptations of a method described previously (36Itakura K. Rossi J.J. Wallace B.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 323-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Two overlapping single-stranded (ss) oligonucleotides, 5 pmol each (shown below as underlined) were annealed to each other by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by an incubation for 30 min at 37 °C and 30 min at room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotide duplexes were made fully double-stranded by filling-in with DNA polymerase I Large (Klenow) fragment in the presence of 16.6 pmol of [α-33P]dATP and 0.33 nmol each of unlabeled dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP in a 30-μl reaction volume containing the EcoPol reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm DTT) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequent to this, 0.33 nmol of unlabeled dATP was added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 30 min. Unincorporated label and cold dNTPs were removed using Quick Spin™ columns as per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Incorporation of the label was confirmed by 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Representative 30-mer and 80-mer ds oligonucleotide duplexes with the canonical CGCCGGCG site (indicated in boldface) are shown as follows:5′-GTGTGTGTGCACGCCGGCGAGCACACACCA-3′3′-CACACACACGTGCGGCCGCTCGTGTGTGGT-5′5′-GCAGATAGCTAGCATCTAGTCGTAGATCGCTCAGACGCCGG CGAGTCAACATGAGATCTGTCTATCGACGATAGCTGAT-3′3′-CGTCTATCGATCGTAGATCAGCATCTAGCGAGTCTGCGGCCG CTCAGTTGTACTCTAGACAGATAGCTGCTATCGACTA-5′The remaining 30-mer and 80-mer oligonucleotide duplexes were designed and generated in the same way as indicated above, except they varied in the SgrAI recognition site: CACCGGCG, CACCGGTG, CGCCGGCT, or TCTAGCAG. The sequence of the oligonucleotide duplex flanked by the SgrAI-specific termini (indicated in boldface) is shown as follows:5′-CCGGCGGTGTGTGTGCATCTAGCAGAGCACACACCACG-3′3′-GCCACACACACGTAGATCGTCTCGTGTGTGGTGCGGCC-5′This duplex (10 pmol/μl) was labeled using 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase, in the presence of 6.6 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP in polynucleotide kinase buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT), in a 30-μl reaction volume for 30 min at room temperature, followed by a 15-min incubation at 37 °C. Unincorporated label was removed using Quick Spin™ columns as per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Incorporation of the label was confirmed by 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Unlabeled oligonucleotide duplexes used in the competition assays were generated and purified essentially as above, except that unlabeled dNTPs were used.For cleavage assays, 80-bp-long DNA fragments containing the canonical sites (CGCCGGCG, CACCGGCG, or CACCGGTG) and secondary sites (CGCCGGCT or CACCGGCT) positioned in the center of each fragment were generated by PCR amplification. To produce templates for DNA amplification, each of the above-mentioned sites was introduced into the multiple cloning site of pUC19 plasmid as follows: two complementary oligonucleotides containing the respective sites were designed to have 5′ ss extensions compatible with the XbaI- and HindIII-generated extensions. A representative oligonucleotide duplex containing the canonical CGCCGGCG site is shown as follows:5′-CTAGAGTGCCGACACTCATCGCCGGCGACGAGTCGGACTGA-3′3′-TCACGGCTGTGAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCTCAGCCTGACTTCGA-5′The annealed oligonucleotide duplexes were cloned into the pUC19 vector, pre-cleaved with XbaI and HindIII. The resultant plasmids were then used as templates in amplification reactions using Vent polymerase and the following primers, 5′-CGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGA-3′ and 5′-GACCATGATTACGCCAAGCTTTC-3′. The resulting 80-bp PCR products were gel-purified, and the DNA concentration was quantitated spectrophotometrically. Each PCR fragment was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP as described above.DNA Binding by Gel Retardation Assay—The gel retardation method (37Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar) was used to determine the apparent association constant (K a) of SgrAI to its canonical sites (CGCCGGCG, CACCGGCG, or CACCGGTG). 33P-Labeled ds oligonucleotide (0.5 pm final concentration) was incubated with 1 μl of a range of serially diluted SgrAI protein (0-80 pm final concentration) in a 10-μl reaction, containing binding buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 50 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) for 30 min at 25 °C. The binding reaction was immediately loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide (29:1 (w/w) acrylamide: bis-acrylamide) gel that had been pre-run at 110 V for 30 min in TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 45 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). The protein-DNA complexes were separated from unbound DNA by gel electrophoresis at 110 V for 1 h at 25 °C. After performing electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in solution containing 70:3:7:20 (v/v) water/glycerol/acetic acid/methanol for 10 min at 25 °C, dried at 65 °C for 2 h, and exposed to X-Omat (Kodak) x-ray film. The autoradiograph was scanned, and the intensity of the bands was analyzed by Image software (version 1.61, National Institutes of Health). The data were plotted using KaleidaGraph (version 3.08) as {[Sbound]/([Sbound] + [Sfree])} × [E] versus [Sbound]/([Sbound] + [Sfree]) as described previously (3Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9820-9825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Whitaker R.D. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The K a value was determined from the slope of the line by linear regression.Equilibrium competition assays were used to determine the apparent association constants (K ib) of SgrAI for oligonucleotide duplexes containing the secondary site (CGCCGGCT) and nonspecific site (TCTAGCAG) and oligonucleotide duplex flanked by SgrAI-specific termini with ss extensions of 5′-CCGG using minor adaptations of the method described previously (3Terry B.J.

Biol. 1999; 285: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). SgrAI protein (20 pm) was added to binding reactions containing 10 pm33P-labeled oligonucleotide duplex containing the canonical CACCGGCG site and varying amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotide duplex (0-20 nm) and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the gels were then processed and quantitated using Image as described above. The data were plotted using KaleidaGraph (version 3.08) as [competitor DNA] versus 1/[ES], where [ES] = [Sbound] × [Sinitial]/([Sbound] + [Sfree]) (3Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9820-9825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Whitaker R.D. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Extrapolation of the plot yields an intercept on the abscissa equal to -K i (1 + ([Sinitial]/K s) where K i and K s are dissociation constants for inhibitor (competitor) and substrate, respectively (3Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9820-9825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Whitaker R.D. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The K s = 1/K a values were taken from the direct equilibrium binding experiment described above. The association constants for competitor, were calculated from K ib = 1/K i, respectively.Steady-state Kinetic Analysis of DNA Cleavage by SgrAI—Steady-state kinetic time courses were performed on the 80-bp-long 32P-labeled PCR fragments carrying various SgrAI recognition sites. In different reactions, substrate concentrations varied between 1 and 20 nm, and SgrAI concentrations were 40 pm for the substrate with the canonical site and 312 pm for the substrate with the secondary site, thereby keeping DNA concentrations in excess over the enzyme. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 50 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol. To determine initial velocity, 10-μl reaction aliquots were removed from the reaction at various time points and quenched in stop buffer (60 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). Reaction products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel by performing electrophoresis at 45 V for 3 h at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gels were processed, exposed to X-Omat (Kodak) x-ray film, and quantitated using Image as described above. The initial reaction velocities were calculated at different substrate concentrations and this data was analyzed using the Hill equation (Equation 1) (39Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1980: 849-866Google Scholar), v=Vmax[S]nKn+[S]n(Eq. 1) where v and V max are the initial and maximal initial SgrAI reaction velocities, [S] is the concentration of the substrate, K is the substrate dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient. Equation 1 was rearranged to give Equation 2. logvVmax-v=nlog[S]-nlogK(Eq. 2) Kinetic parameters (turnover number, k cat, and the apparent second order rate constant, k cat/K) were determined by curve fitting to Equation 2 at various concentrations of substrate.The effect of oligonucleotide duplexes flanked by SgrAI-specific or nonspecific termini on the reaction velocities at the canonical site, CACCGGCG, and the secondary site, CACCGGCT, was tested. The sequence of the oligonucleotide duplex flanked by the SgrAI-specific termini is the same as shown above. The sequence of the oligonucleotide duplex flanked by the nonspecific termini was identical, except that it carried 5′-GGCC ss extensions. The cleavage reactions in the presence of the oligonucleotide duplex were performed as described above, except the oligonucleotide duplex was added at a 50-fold molar excess over the substrate with the canonical site and at a 4-fold molar excess over the substrate with the secondary site (35Bitinaite J. Schildkraut I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 99: 1164-1169Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar).RESULTSSgrAI Specifically Binds to Canonical, Secondary, and Cleaved Canonical Sites—The binding of SgrAI restriction endonuclease for all three canonical sites was determined using direct-binding gel retardation assays. Experiments were first conducted in the absence of the metal cofactor Mg2+ to prevent cleavage of the oligonucleotide duplexes, but no specific SgrAI-DNA complex was observed (data not shown). Studies with EcoRV and PvuII have shown that Ca2+ stabilizes site-specific DNA binding, while not supporting catalysis (7Engler L.E. Welch K.K. Jen-Jacobson L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 40Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 41Nastri H.G. Evans P.D. Walker I.H. Riggs P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25761-25767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, SgrAI retardation experiments were carried out in the presence of either 2 or 5 mm Ca2+. In the presence of 5 mm Ca2+, SgrAI formed a complex with an oligonucleotide duplex containing the canonical site. Control experiments indicated that the observed complex was sequence-specific, because in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ there was no specific complex formation with an oligonucleotide duplex lacking the canonical site at all tested concentrations of the SgrAI protein (data not shown).Representative gel-retardation results of SgrAI binding to the CGCCGGCG site are shown in Fig. 1A. The equilibrium binding constants (K a) on all three canonical sites were determined from the direct-binding measurements as shown in Fig. 1B. The calculated K a values are listed in Table I. To determine any contributions from the length of the oligonucleotide duplex toward the affinity of SgrAI for the specific site, the oligonucleotides were also varied in length (30-mer versus 80-mer). For the given lengths of the oligonucleotide duplexes tested, the binding affinity of SgrAI endonuclease was found to be independent of their length. The obtained K a values for all three canonical sites were similar (4.0-7.7 × 1010m-1). Gel retardation assays were also performed with duplexes containing the secondary site (CGCCGGCT), nonspecific site (TCTAGCAG) and an oligonucleotide duplex flanked by the SgrAI-specific termini with ss extensions of 5′CCGG. However, SgrAI binding to these substrates was too weak to permit measurements of K a values by the direct-equilibrium binding method.Table IEquilibrium association constants of SgrAI binding to the oligonucleotide duplexes with canonical sequences by direct gel retardation analysis in the presence of Ca 2+Canonical sequenceaThe degenerate positions of the canonical sequences occupied by different base pairs are marked in boldface.Oligonucleotide lengthKabpm−1CGCCGGCG804.4(±0.4) × 1010GCGGCCGC304.0(±0.5) × 1010CACCGGCG805.7(±0.3) × 1010GTGGCCGC307.7(±0.9) × 1010CACCGGTG806.2(±0.7) × 1010GTGGCCAC305.3(±0.3) × 1010a The degenerate positions of the canonical sequences occupied by different base pairs are marked in boldface.

https://openalex.org/W1974472983,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic factor that plays an important role in complex biological processes such as embryogenesis, tissue regeneration, cancerogenesis, and angiogenesis. HGF promotes cell proliferation, survival, motility, and morphogenesis through binding to its receptor, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by the MET proto-oncogene (c-met). Structurally speaking, HGF is a polypeptide related to the enzymes of the blood coagulation cascade. Thus, it comprises kringle domains that in some other proteins have been shown to be responsible for the anti-angiogenic activity. To check whether the isolated kringles of HGF were able to inhibit angiogenesis, we produced them as recombinant proteins and compared their biological activity with that of the recombinant HGF N-terminal domain (N). We showed that (i) none of the isolated HGF kringle exhibits an anti-angiogenic activity; (ii) N is a new anti-angiogenic polypeptide; (iii) the inhibitory action of N is not specific toward HGF, because it antagonized the angiogenic activity of other growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor; and (iv) in contrast with full-length HGF, N does not bind to the c-met receptor in vitro, but fully retains its heparin-binding capacity. Our results suggest that N inhibits angiogenesis not by disrupting the HGF/c-met interaction but rather by interfering with the endothelial glycosaminoglycans, which are the secondary binding sites of HGF.

Byrd R.A. Structure. 1998; 6: 109-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently x-ray crystal structures were determined for the complexes of heparin with NK1, a naturally occurring HGF variant containing N domain and K1, which suggested that some heparin binding activity is also located within K1 (18Lietha D. Chirgadze D.Y. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Gherardi E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5543-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Up to date, no discernible function has been demonstrated for the third (K3) and fourth (K4) kringles of HGF. The kringle domain is an 80-amino acid triple-loop structure maintained by three intramolecular disulfide bonds highly conserved between different kringle containing proteins (19Ikeo K. Takahashi K. Gojobori T. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Kringles are thought to play an important role in regulating the nature and strength of protein-protein interactions. Several reports have documented the anti-angiogenic activity of isolated kringles of different origin. The most known example is angiostatin, the three- to four-kringle containing fragment of human plasminogen (20O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y.

Llinas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22924-22928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). More recently the prothrombin kringle-2 domain has been shown to inhibit endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryos (23Lee T.H. Rhim T. Kim S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28805-28812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); a recombinant apolipoprotein (a) containing 18 kringle repeats has been implicated in the reduction of tumor microvessel density in transgenic mice (24Trieu V.N. Uckun F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which the kringles suppress blood vessel formation is still unknown. We hypothesized that one or more of the kringles of HGF might inhibit angiogenesis and that the mechanism of the anti-angiogenic activity of a kringle domain could be related to its ability to antagonize the HGF binding to c-met. To verify this hypothesis, we produced each of the five HGF α-chain individual modules as recombinant proteins and analyzed their binding properties and biological activity in different assays related to angiogenesis. Materials—The bacterial expression vectors pET15b and pET21b(+), the Escherichia coli expression strain BL21(DE3), and tetracycline hydrochloride were purchased from Novagen (VWR International, Fontenay-sous-Bois, France). EZMix 2×YT microbial medium, carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, IPTG, non-fractionated heparin (catalog number H 3393) and low molecular weight heparin (average molecular weight 3000, catalog number H 3400), a peroxidase conjugated antibody against goat IgG, protein A from Staphylococcus aureus, and 0.2% gelatin were all purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Type I rat tail collagen was purchased from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA). Research grade CM5 sensor chips (carboxymethylated dextran matrix), SA sensor chips, amine coupling kit (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide), and surfactant P20 were all obtained from BIACORE (Uppsala, Sweden). Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—The isolated HGF α-chain domains were produced using the pET-based bacterial expression system (Novagen). The DNA encoding different HGF polypeptides was generated by PCR using Pwo DNA polymerase and the pGEM/HGF-TM construct as a template (a generous gift of Dr. Pascale Briand at Institut Cochin de Génétique Moléculaire) (25Nguyen T.H. Pages J.C. Farge D. Briand P. Weber A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2469-2479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This construct encodes for an HGF splice variant lacking a pentapeptide FLPSS in the first kringle domain (the amino acids from 162 to 166, according to the sequence deposited in the Swiss-Prot data base under accession number P14210) but which preserves all the biological activity of full-length variant (26Shima N. Tsuda E. Goto M. Yano K. Hayasaka H. Ueda M. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Lokker N.A. Presta L.G. Godowski P.J. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The primers used for PCR were: N forward, 5′-ATATCATATGCAAAGGAAAAGAAGAAATACAA-3′ and N reverse, 5′-ATATGGATCCTAGTTTCTAATGTAGTCTTTGTTTT-3′;K1 forward, 5′-ATATCATATGAACTGCATCATTGGTAAAGGA-3′ and K1 reverse, 5′-ATATGTCGACTTCTGAACACTGAGGAATGTC-3′; K2 forward, 5′-ATATGGATCCAGTTGAATGCATGACCTGCA-3′ and K2 reverse, 5′-ATATGTCGACGTCAGCGCATGTTTTAATTGC-3′; K3 forward, 5′-ATATGGATCCAACTGAATGCATCCAAGGTC-3′ and K3 reverse, 5′-ATATGTCGACCATATCACAGTTTGGAATTTG-3′; and K4 forward, 5′-ATATGGATCCAGATTGTTATCGTGGGAATGG-3′ and K4 reverse, 5′-ATATGTCGACACCTTCACAACGAGAAATAGG-3′. The purified PCR fragment encoding the HGF N-terminal domain (amino acids from 32 to 127) was cloned into NdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b, in-frame with N-terminal His Tag. The DNA for K1 (amino acids from 127 to 208) was cloned into NdeI and SalI sites of pET21b(+), in-frame with C-terminal His Tag, and the DNA for K2 (amino acids from 209 to 290), K3 (amino acids from 303 to 385), and K4 (amino acids from 390 to 471) were all cloned into BamHI and SalI sites of pET21b(+), inframe with N-terminal T7 Tag and C-terminal His Tag. All PCR-generated constructs were checked for polymerase fidelity by sequencing (Génome Express, Grenoble, France). All plasmids encoding HGF kringles, or the plasmid encoding the HGF N domain were electroporated, respectively, into E. coli strain BL21(DE3), or into E. coli BL21(DE3) based strain pRI (kindly provided by Dr. Janne L. Simonsen at Arhus University) carrying two additional plasmids: one encoding a tRNAIle specific for the rare isoleucine codon AUA and another for the LacZ repressor RP4. Bacteria were grown at 30 °C in EZMix 2× YT medium containing 1 m glucose and appropriate antibiotics. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG for 4 h at 25 °C. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C. Bacterial pellets (5 g wet weight) were resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with rotation. The suspensions were sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. All HGF kringles were recovered in the supernatants and purified by cobalt-chelate affinity chromatography on a 2-ml TALON column under non-denaturing conditions. The pellet containing insoluble N was resuspended in 30 ml of isolation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 2 m urea, and 2% Triton X-100) and subjected to three successive rounds of brief sonication, centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), and resuspension. The supernatants from all three steps were pooled and applied to a TALON column equilibrated with isolation buffer. To achieve the N domain renaturation, the column was washed with a 2 to 0 m gradient of urea in IMAC buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 0.5 m NaCl) containing 10 mm imidazole. Renatured N was eluted by IMAC buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. Further steps were all performed at 4 °C. Selected column fractions corresponding to the peaks of purified N, K1, K2, K3, or K4 were pooled and diluted with 10 volumes of refolding buffer (PBS containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.2 mm oxidized glutathione). Following an overnight incubation with stirring, the protein solutions were concentrated using Ultrafree-15 Centrifugal Filter Devices and dialyzed against PBS containing 10% glycerol for 2 days with at least three changes of buffer. The final protein preparations were sterilized using 0.22-μm Millex-GV filter units and stored at –80 °C until required. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay. The purified recombinant HGF-derived proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by circular dichroism as described previously (28Bulteau A.L. Verbeke P. Petropoulos I. Chaffotte A.F. Friguet B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45662-45668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated by collagenase (Roche Diagnostics) digestion (29Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6011) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely grown in flasks coated with gelatin, in M199 medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, 7.5% NHS, and 7.5% FBS (regular medium). HUVECs from the second or third passage were used. The human colorectal carcinoma cell line DLD-1, the human osteogenic sarcoma cell line TE 85, and the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line Capan-1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (hASMCs) and the corresponding growth medium (SmGM-2), and the human normal epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and the corresponding growth medium (KGM) were purchased from Clonetics (BioWhittaker France). Proliferation Assay—Cells that had been grown until confluence were harvested by trypsinization, and their proliferation was measured by use of a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Cells were plated in 24-well plates: HUVECs at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in M199 medium supplemented with 2.5% FBS, hASMCs at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in SmGM-2 supplemented with 1% FBS, NHEKs at a density of 104 cells/well in KGM supplemented with 3 mg/ml AlbuMAX (Invitrogen), TE 85 cells at a density 5 × 103 cells/well, DLD-1 and Capan-1 cells at a density of 104 cells/well in RPMI supplemented with 3 mg/ml AlbuMAX. Cells were allowed to attach for 4 h at 37 °C, and proliferation was induced by adding 10% FBS or 10 ng/ml of FGF-2, VEGF165, HGF, or PDGF BB. The rising concentrations (10–5000 nm) of purified recombinant HGF-derived proteins were added to some wells, and HUVECs were incubated for a further 24 h. [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi/well) was added during the last 18 h of incubation. Cells were washed three times with PBS and treated with ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 30 min. The resulting precipitates were solubilized with 0.3 n NaOH (0.5 ml/well), and the incorporated radioactivity was measured in a LS-6500 multipurpose scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Migration Assay—HUVEC migration was evaluated in a modified Boyden chamber assay. Transwell cell culture chamber inserts (BD Biosciences) with porous polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size) were coated with 0.2% gelatin in PBS. HUVECs suspended in M199 medium supplemented with 2.5% FBS were added to the inserts at 4 × 104 cells per well. The inserts were placed over chambers containing a chemotactic stimulus (10 ng/ml HGF, FGF-2, or VEGF165), and cells were allowed to migrate for 5 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. For inhibition experiments one of the purified HGF α-chain-derived polypeptides (each at 1 μm) was added to the lower chamber. The filters were then rinsed with PBS, fixed with 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and stained with hematoxylin of Harris. The upper surface of the filters was scraped with a cotton swab to remove the non-migrant cells. The number of cells per high power field (×200) was recorded. Each experimental point was performed in triplicate, and 10 fields per filter were analyzed. “In Gel” Three-dimensional Collagen Culture—Type I rat tail collagen composed gels were formed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, an ice-cold collagen solution was neutralized by addition of 1 n NaOH and mixed with 10× PBS in the ratio 9:1. HUVECs (passage 2) isolated by trypsin-EDTA treatment and suspended in the M199 medium supplemented with 2.5% FBS, were added at a final concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml in a 1 mg/ml collagen solution. 0.4 ml of this suspension was poured into wells of a 24-well plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), and the gels were allowed to form at 37 °C for 40 min. The gels were then overlaid with 0.5 ml of M199 medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/ml of the growth factors. When indicated, purified recombinant HGF domains (1 μm) were added at the same time as the growth factors to the overlaying medium. Cultures were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Digital images were captured using a Kappa CF11DSP charge-coupled device camera (KAPPA opto-electronics GmbH, Gleichen, Germany). Radiolabeled Ligand Binding and Displacement Experiments—HGF (5 μg), VEGF165 (10 μg), FGF-2 (10 μg), or recombinant HGF N-terminal domain (25 μg) were iodinated with 1 mCi of [125I]NaI using the IODO-GEN Pre-Coated Iodination Tubes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Iodinated proteins were purified by chromatography on PD-10 columns equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.25% AlbuMAX and concentrated using the Ultrafree-4 Centrifugal Filter Device. The specific activities determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation were 18 × 106 cpm/pmol for 125I-HGF, 8 × 106 cpm/pmol for 125I-VEGF165, 9 × 105 cpm/pmol for 125I-FGF-2, and 5 × 105 cpm/pmol for 125I-N. Binding and displacement studies with the iodinated proteins were carried out on confluent HUVECs in 24-well dishes, at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and preincubated for 30 min with 0.5 ml of binding medium (M199 medium containing 0.1% AlbuMAX). To determine the binding parameters for N, increasing amounts of radiolabeled N were added to HUVECs, with or without a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled N, and incubated for 6 h. For displacement experiments, constant amounts of radiolabeled HGF (1.5 nm), VEGF165 (1.2 nm), or FGF-2 (1 nm) were added to HUVECs in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled N for 4 h. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with binding medium and solubilized with 0.3 n NaOH. HUVEC-associated radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter, and the results were analyzed using the program Ligand included in the KELL package (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). All experiments were done in triplicate. The Kd values represent the means ± S.D. obtained from three or four experiments. In Vitro Binding Studies by Surface Plasmon Resonance—The binding studies were performed on a BIACORE 2000 instrument. The analytes were routinely diluted in BIACORE running buffer (PBS, pH 7.5, containing 0.005% P-20) completed with 0.2 mg/ml BSA, and injected at 20 μl/min. Between binding cycles the coated surfaces were regenerated by two injections of 1 m NaCl. In each case the first flow channel of the sensor chip did not contain any immobilized ligand and served as a reference surface. In one set of experiments, a non-fractionated heparin (NF heparin) was biotinylated with EZ-Link Biotin-LC-Hydrazide as described in a previous study (30Yu Q. Toole B.P. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 122-129PubMed Google Scholar) and about 600 RU were captured on the surface of streptavidin-coated SA sensor chips. The c-met/Fc chimera was captured on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip with immobilized protein A (600 RU). HGF and purified HGF domains were injected over immobilized heparin and c-met. In a second set of experiments, HGF and its domains were immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip surface (∼1000 RU) using the amine coupling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. NF heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMW heparin), and soluble c-met, were used as analytes. Binding curves were obtained over a range of analyte concentrations for each of the analyte/ligand pairs. The data were analyzed with the non-linear least squares algorithm implemented in the BIAevaluation 3.1 software package. Statistics—Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni/Dunn analysis. Production and Purification of Recombinant HGF α-Chain Structural Modules—The HGF kringles were all expressed in E. coli in a soluble form. Recombinant N-terminal domain was mainly accumulated in insoluble inclusion bodies and was easily solubilized with 2 m urea containing 2% Triton X-100. The proteins were purified to homogeneity using a simple one-step procedure on TALON metal affinity column (Fig. 1). They were subsequently subjected to oxidative folding using the glutathione-based oxido-shuffling system. The final protein preparations were analyzed in SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions to ensure the presence of disulfide bonds (Fig. 1). We observed very little or no difference in the mobility of the non-reduced and reduced N, although this protein possesses two disulfide bonds. In contrast, the non-reduced K1 exhibited a substantial mobility shift compared with the reduced sample. Similar results had been previously reported for N and K1 produced in E. coli (31Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Kaufman J.D. Pannell L.K. Cioce V. Sakata H. Taylor W.G. Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). K2, K3, and K4 also demonstrated an increased mobility under non-reducing conditions. These results indicate that our HGF kringle preparations have a compact conformation under non-reducing conditions and that the disulfide bonds were formed during the refolding procedure. The circular dichroism analysis of N, K1, K2, K3, and K4 demonstrated that these proteins were folded. The far-UV CD spectra (180–260 nm) of N, K1, K2, K3, and K4 are all indicative of a high content in secondary structure. A broad band of positive ellipticity can be seen in the 230- to 260-nm region: it most probably originates from oxidized disulfides and aromatic residues involved in the characteristic hydrophobic core of the kringle-type folding. The near-UV CD spectra (240–340 nm) show bands in the 275- to 290-nm region, which are characteristic of an asymmetric orientation of aromatic residues (Trp and Tyr). These signals are typical for the folded tertiary structure of globular proteins (data not shown). Effect of Isolated HGF Domains on Cell Proliferation—Angiogenic response involves a surge in endothelial cell proliferation, which could be induced by several growth factors (32Kumar R. Yoneda J. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 749-757PubMed Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, the highest capacity of induction of HUVEC proliferation was demonstrated for FGF-2, whereas HGF was a very poor mitogen (about 750% stimulation against 25%; Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). Therefore, we first analyzed the effect of isolated HGF domains on the proliferation of HUVECs stimulated with 10 ng/ml FGF-2 (Fig. 2A). In these experiments none of HGF-derived kringles exhibited any activity, whereas N inhibited HUVEC proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. The influence of N on HUVEC proliferation could be detected at a concentration of 100 nm (about 10% of inhibition). Depending on the umbilical cord specimen, a maximum inhibition effect (up to 100%) was observed for a concentration of N of 1–5 μm. Because our hypothesis was that kringles could modulate angiogenesis by competitive binding to the c-met receptor, we also studied the effect of recombinant HGF domains on the proliferation of HUVECs induced by HGF. The kringles of HGF had no effect on the proliferation of HUVECs in the presence of HGF (Fig. 2B). In contrast, N significantly inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs induced not only by HGF but also by two isoforms of VEGF: VEGF165 and VEGF121 (Fig. 2C). Thus, the anti-proliferative effect of N was not specific toward HGF. We further tested the specificity of the anti-proliferative effect of N toward the endothelial cell type. In the"

The clamp loader, γ complex (γ3δδ′χψ), assembles β around DNA in an ATP-fueled reaction. The δ subunit of the clamp loader opens the β ring and is referred to as the wrench; ATP modulates contact between β and δ among other functions. Crystal structures of δ·β and the γ3δδ′ minimal clamp loader make predictions of the clamp loader mechanism, which are tested in this report by mutagenesis. The δ wrench contacts β at two sites. One site is at the β dimer interface, where δ appears to distort the interface by via a steric clash between a helix on δ and a loop near the β interface. The energy for this steric clash is thought to derive from the other site of interaction, in which δ binds to a hydrophobic pocket in β. The current study demonstrates that rather than a simple steric clash with β, δ specifically contacts β at this site, but not through amino acid side chains, and thus is presumably mediated by peptide backbone atoms. The results also imply that the interaction of δ at the hydrophobic site on β contributes to destabilization of the β dimer interface rather than acting solely as a grip of δ on β. Within the γ complex, δ′ is proposed to prevent δ from binding to β in the absence of ATP. This report demonstrates that one or more γ subunits also contribute to this role. The results also indicate that δ′ acts as a backboard upon which the γ subunits push to attain the ATP induced change needed for the δ wrench to bind and open the β ring.

Chromosomal replicases of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes derive their high processivity during synthesis from a ring-shaped clamp that encircles DNA and binds to the chromosomal replicase (1Kelman Z.

The closed circular structure of the clamp necessitates a clamp loader to crack open the ring and place it around the primed DNA in an ATP driven reaction. In Escherichia coli, the β-clamp is a ring-shaped dimer formed by two crescent-shaped protomers that encircle the duplex (6Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each β protomer consists of three domains, each of which have the same chain fold (7Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M.

The β ring binds to the replicative DNA polymerase III core (Pol III) 1The abbreviations used are: Pol III, polymerase III; DTT, dithiothreitol; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; RFC, replication factor C; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. and tethers it to the template for high processivity. The clamp is opened and closed around the DNA by the γ complex clamp loader. The minimal γ complex clamp loader machine (reviewed in Ref. 5O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 935-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) consists of five different subunits: δ, δ′, and three copies of γ (τ) that are arranged as a circular heteropentamer (Fig. 1A) (8Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition, two other subunits, χ and ψ, are associated with the clamp loader, but they are not required for clamp loading in vitro (9Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order for this clamp loader to bind two molecules of DNA polymerase III core, two of the γ subunits are replaced by two τ subunits. τ and γ are encoded by the same gene (dnaX); τ is the full-length product, and γ is a truncated version produced by a translational frameshift (10Blinkowa A.L.

The unique 24-kDa C terminus of τ, absent in γ, binds DNA polymerase III core (13Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

The γ (τ) subunits of the γ complex are the only subunits that hydrolyze ATP (1Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and therefore constitute the motor of the clamp loading machine. The δ subunit is referred to as the wrench of the clamp loader, since it can open the β dimer at one interface on its own (17Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The energy for ring opening is not derived from ATP (neither δ nor β bind ATP) but from the energy of protein-protein interaction between δ and β (17Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, the γ complex does not bind β (18Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Study of the δ′ subunit shows that it modulates the ability of δ to bind β even in the absence of other γ complex subunits (17Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Stewart J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19182-19189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, δ′ is proposed to obscure the δ subunit within γ complex from binding to β when ATP is not present (17Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, when ATP binds to the γ subunits, the complex undergoes a conformational change in which it is hypothesized that a portion of δ′ separates from δ, allowing δ to bind and open the β ring (18Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Only one δ binds to the β2 dimer (18Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, δ binds to a monomer mutant of β (β1) with 50-fold higher affinity than to β2 (19Stewart J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19182-19189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This result indicates that when δ interacts with one member of the β2 dimer, it uses a portion of its binding energy to perform work (i.e. to part one of the dimer interfaces), thus lowering the observed affinity of δ to β2. Furthermore, only one δ subunit binds β2, suggesting that only one of the dimer interfaces is disrupted by δ (17Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19182-19189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Opening at only one β2 interface is also consistent with the observation that β2, cross-linked at only one dimer interface, is efficiently loaded onto DNA by γ complex (17Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of δ in complex with a β monomer mutant (δ·β1), combined with the structure of the minimal clamp loader (γ3δδ′), provides further details and allows predictions about how δ opens β2 (8Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Of the three domains of δ, only the N-terminal domain (domain I) interacts with β (Fig. 1B), and it contacts the clamp in two different places. The first site of the δ-β interaction involves hydrophobic contacts between residues Leu73 and Phe74 of δ and a hydrophobic pocket of β located between domains II and III (Fig. 1, B and C). We refer to this as “site 1.” Both Leu73 and Phe74 of δ protrude out to form a hydrophobic plug that fits into the hydrophobic pocket on the surface of β. This hydrophobic interaction is presumed to be responsible for the majority of the binding energy. Interestingly, δ residues Leu73 and Phe74 are the most highly conserved residues among δ subunits of different bacteria (20Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23Dalrymple B.P. Kongsuwan K. Wijffels G. Dixon N.E. Jennings P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Likewise, alignment of bacterial β subunits shows that residues comprising the hydrophobic pocket in β to which δ binds are highly conserved (20Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). There is a second interaction between δ and β that involves δ helix α4 and β loop α1″-β2″. This contact is referred to here as “site 2” (Fig. 1C). The interaction of δ with β at this site leads to an extensive conformational change of the β loop that is thought to be important for ring opening (20Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This five-residue loop of β (residues 274-278) is near the interface and in fact connects to the interfacial α helix that contains the two residues (Ile272 and Leu273) that form the hydrophobic core of the β2 dimer interface. In contrast, the structure of the δ·β1 complex shows that the hydrophobic core residues of β are rotated out of position, thereby precluding formation of the dimer interface (Fig. 1C). Thus, it would appear that δ distorts one β2 interface by altering the conformation of the β 274-278 loop. This distortion at site 2 appears to be the result of a steric clash between δ and β, which pushes on the loop, rather than being due to specific side chain contacts between δ and β. Hence, the site 2 interaction/steric clash presumably requires an input of energy that is obtained from the binding energy at site 1. The δ subunit destabilizes the interface of β2 but does not explain how a gap opens up at the β interface for DNA to pass through. The shape of β1 in the δ·β1 structure relative to the β2 dimer suggests how the ring actually opens (20Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Superposition of monomeric β (i.e. of the δ·β1 complex) onto dimeric β reveals that the shape of the β monomer is less curved than in the dimer. This change in curvature is produced by rigid body motions between the three domains of β. The largest rigid body motion occurs distant from the δ-binding sites, suggesting that the change is intrinsic to β and that the closed β dimer is under spring tension between domains of β. After disruption of the dimer interface by the δ subunit, release of the spring tension results in the motions between domains that produce the gap at the broken interface (20Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The γ3δδ′ structure fits nicely with biochemical data indicating that β cannot bind γ complex in the absence of ATP and that δ′ participates in modulating the δ-β interaction. The γ3δδ′ structure (8Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) shows that each of the subunits is composed of three domains having the same chain fold and is a member of the AAA+ family. The five subunits are arranged as a circular heteropentamer (Fig. 1A). The C-terminal domains of all five subunits form a tight closed circular connection, holding the subunits together. On the contrary, the connections between the N-terminal domains contain a gap between δ and δ′ (see Fig. 1A). Docking of β2 onto δ shows that β2 does not fit due to steric occlusion by δ′ and possibly some of the γ subunits as well. This is consistent with the fact that ATP is not present in the structure. It is proposed that as the ATP sites fill, conformation changes in γ are propagated around the pentamer to increase the gap between δ and δ′, thereby allowing δ to bind to β for clamp opening (8Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 17Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this state, with β and ATP bound to γ complex, a tight affinity for DNA is established (22Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 24Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Upon recognizing a primed site, the ATP is hydrolyzed and the γ subunits may move δ back into proximity with δ′, forcing the β ring off the δ wrench and allowing the β ring to close around the DNA. The δ′ structure was the first clamp loader subunit to be solved (25Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). δ′ appears to be more rigid than the γ and δ subunits (8Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This conclusion derives from the observation that the three domains of δ′ in γ complex are oriented nearly the same as in the δ′ alone. In contrast, the relative orientations of domain III relative to domains I/II of all three γ subunits are different in γ3δδ′, and the same is true for δ in δ·β1 compared with δ in the γ3δδ′ structure. Consistent with a rigid structure, δ′ has additional connections between domains compared with the few connections between the domains in either γ or δ. This rigid conformation of δ′ has earned it the title of stator, the stationary part of a machine upon which the other parts move (8Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Perhaps the rigid δ′ stator serves as an anvil for the β interactive element of δ to strike, pushing β2 off of the γ complex following ATP hydrolysis. A recent report demonstrates that δ′, besides its role as stator, also plays an instrumental role in the motor function of γ complex, as predicted by the structure, by supplying a catalytic arginine into the ATP site at the intersubunit junction δ′/γ1 (8Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 26Johnson A. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14406-14413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In light of the γ3δδ′ and δ·β1 crystal structures and predictions of how these proteins function, we reexamine here the mechanism of clamp loading by the γ complex, in particular the δ-β interaction, and the role of δ′ in rendering the β interacting elements of δ accessible for binding the clamp. The studies contain surprises, but overall the results provide significant advancements in our understanding of how this complex machinery functions.

In one, which we refer to here as δα4, the Asn62 and Phe65 residues located on helix α4 were mutated to alanines. In the other, referred to as δLF→AA, residues Leu73 and Phe74 were mutated to alanines. These mutants were constructed by DNA oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis of the pETδ expression plasmid (28Dong Z. Onrust R. Skangalis M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Expression plasmids were transformed into competent BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen). Fresh transformants were grown in 12 liters of LB containing 200 μg of ampicillin/ml to a density of A 600 = 0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were incubated 4 h with shaking at 37 °C, chilled to 15 °C, and incubated another 20 h with shaking at 15 °C. For cell lysis, cells were brought to a final volume of 300-400 ml with a final concentration of 30 mm spermidine, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT in Tris-sucrose buffer. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French Press at 17,000 p.s.i. and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C in an SLA1500 rotor. The soluble cell lysate supernatant (Fraction I) was decanted and treated with 0.21 g/ml ammonium sulfate. After stirring for 30 min at 4 °C, the pellet was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min in a SLA1500 rotor. The resulting pellet was resuspended in Buffer B. The protein was diluted to a conductivity equal to 60 mm NaCl with Buffer B and then applied to a Heparin-agarose column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in Buffer B. Protein was eluted with a 100-500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer B. Fractions containing δ were pooled (Fraction II) and diluted with Buffer B to a conductivity equivalent to 100 mm NaCl. Particulate matter was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in an SS34 rotor. The supernatant was applied to a MonoQ column equilibrated in Buffer B.

Fractions containing δ were pooled (Fraction III, δLF→AA mutant: 45 ml, 1.2 mg/ml; δα4 mutant: 32 ml, 1.0 mg/ml) and then stored at -80 °C. δ′ΔN—Nucleotides encoding the N-terminal 206 residues of δ′ were deleted from the pETδ′ expression plasmid (28Dong Z. Onrust R. Skangalis M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

The product encodes the entire C-terminal domain (domain III) of δ′ but eliminates domains I and II. The resulting PCR product was placed into pETIIa at the NdeI and BamHI sites to yield pETδ′ΔN. BL21 (DE3) pETδ′ΔN cells were grown in 3 liters of LB containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml to a density of A 600 = 0.6 and induced with 0.8 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.

Protein was eluted with a 500 ml, 50-600 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Most of the protein was found in the flow-through and in the first few fractions. These were pooled together and applied to an 8-ml MonoQ column equilibrated in Buffer A. Protein was eluted using a 120-ml, 50-600 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Fractions containing δ′ΔN were dialyzed against Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl and then stored at -80 °C (15 ml, 1.4 mg/ml). β loop—An internal deletion of the dnaN gene encoding β amino acids 275-278 was made in the pETβ expression vector by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GAT GCC GGC CAC GAT GCG TCC GGC G-3′, which anneals to upstream vector sequence, and 5′-TTA TTG CTC AGC GGT GGC AGC AGC CAA CTC AGC TTC CTT TCG GG-3′, which includes a SacII site at nucleotide 834 of dnaN. The resulting PCR product was digested with MfeI/SacII, and the 287-bp fragment was inserted into pETβ digested with the same enzymes to produce pETβloop. BL21 (DE3) pETβloop cells were grown in 3 liters of LB containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml to a density of A 600 = 0.8 and induced with 0.8 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were incubated for 2 h with shaking in fluted flasks at 37 °C. For cell lysis, cells were brought to a final volume of 300-400 ml with a final concentration of 30 mm spermidine, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT in Tris-sucrose buffer. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French press at 17,000 p.s.i., and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in an SLA1500 rotor. Soluble lysate was treated with 0.436 g/ml of ammonium sulfate and stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended and dialyzed overnight against Buffer A. The protein was applied to a Fast Flow Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A and then eluted with a 0-500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Peak fractions containing the βloop mutant were pooled and then dialyzed against Buffer C overnight. The protein was applied to an SP-Sepharose column equilibrated in Buffer C and eluted with a 0-500 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer. The protein flowed through the column. The pH of the flow-through was lowered to pH 6.1 on ice by adding acetic acid, and the protein was reapplied to an SP-Sepharose column equilibrated in Buffer D. The βloop mutant was eluted with 0-500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer D. The βloop mutant remained in the flow-through and was precipitated with 20% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer A and dialyzed against Buffer A overnight. The protein was then applied to an 8-ml Mono Q column equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was washed extensively with Buffer A before eluting protein using a 160-ml gradient of 0-500 mm NaCl in Buffer A. Fractions containing the βloop mutant were pooled and dialyzed overnight against Buffer A. The preparation was passed over a 10-ml ATP-agarose column equilibrated in Buffer A to remove any possible contaminant of γ complex that binds this column tightly. The βloop protein flowed through the column and was stored at -80 °C (22 ml, 1.9 mg/ml). Interaction between β or the βloop mutant and wild-type and mutant γ complex was analyzed by gel filtration on an FPLC-Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences). The β subunit (25 or 30 μm dimer, as indicated) was incubated with 5 or 25 μm (as indicated) γ complex (or mutant γ complex) for 15 min at 15 °C in 200 μl of Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP and"
https://openalex.org/W2085383917,"The Cre protein of bacteriophage P1 is a tyrosine recombinase and catalyzes recombination via formation of a covalent protein-DNA complex and a Holliday junction intermediate. Several co-crystal structures of Cre bound to its target lox site have provided novel insights into its biochemical activities. We have used these structures to guide the mutagenesis of several Cre residues that contact the lox spacer region and/or are involved in intersubunit protein-protein interactions. None of the mutant proteins had significant defects in DNA binding, DNA bending, or strand-specific initiation of recombination. We have identified novel functions of several amino acids that are involved in three aspects of the Cre reaction. 1) Single mutation of several NH2-terminal basic residues that contact the spacer region of loxP caused the accumulation of Holliday junction (HJ) intermediates but only a modest impairment of recombination. These residues may be involved in the isomerization of the Holliday intermediate. 2) We identified three new residues (Arg-118, Lys-122, and Glu-129) that are involved in synapsis. Cre R118A, K122A, and E129Q were catalytically competent. 3) Mutations E129R, Q133H, and K201A inactivated catalysis by the protein. The function of these Cre residues in recombination is discussed. The Cre protein of bacteriophage P1 is a tyrosine recombinase and catalyzes recombination via formation of a covalent protein-DNA complex and a Holliday junction intermediate. Several co-crystal structures of Cre bound to its target lox site have provided novel insights into its biochemical activities. We have used these structures to guide the mutagenesis of several Cre residues that contact the lox spacer region and/or are involved in intersubunit protein-protein interactions.

The phage P1 Cre recombinase is a member of the tyrosine recombinase (integrase) family of conservative site-specific recombinases whose members use a conserved tyrosine as a key catalytic nucleophile (1Argos P.

Cre is of interest not only for the wealth of biochemical and structural information it has offered into the recombination mechanisms, but also because it is one of the most useful tools for engineering mammalian chromosomes in the study of development (14Sauer B. Henderson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5166-5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The Cre protein catalyzes recombination at its target sequence, the loxP site (Fig. 1a). This 34-bp sequence consists of two identical 13-bp inverted repeats (symmetry elements) that surround an asymmetrical 8-bp spacer region (15Hoess R.H. Ziese M. Sternberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Biol. 1985; 181: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cleavage occurs by covalent attachment of the protein to the 3′-phosphoryl group at the site of the nick via the conserved catalytic Tyr-324 (12Van Duyne G.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Cre folds into a two domain structure (Fig. 1b): the small NH2-terminal domain interacts with the inner portion of the symmetry element and the spacer region, while the COOH-terminal catalytic domain contacts the entire symmetry element (8Guo F.

The two Cre subunits bound to the lox site in slightly different conformations: the “cleaving” subunit is in position to cleave the scissile phosphate, whereas the “non-cleaving” subunit is in an inactive mode (Fig. 1c). While the cleaving and non-cleaving Cre subunits make similar contacts with the symmetry elements, they interact differently with the spacer region (Fig. 1d) (10Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In particular, several NH2-terminal basic residues in the cleaving subunit directly contact the DNA phosphate backbone opposite the activated scissile phosphate. As a result, the continuous strand (containing the inactive scissile phosphate) is tightly bound in the Cre-DNA interface, while the solvent-exposed crossing strand (containing the activated scissile phosphate) points toward the center cavity of the synapse poised for strand exchange after cleavage (10Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Recombination takes place within a roughly square-planar synaptic complex consisting of four Cre molecules and two lox sites (Fig. 1c) (8Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D.

The Cre-lox synaptic complex is stabilized by an intricate network of cyclic protein-protein interactions between the Cre molecules bound to the same lox site (“cross-spacer” interactions) and those bound to two different lox sites (“synaptic” interactions). We hereafter refer to the cross-spacer/synaptic protein-protein interactions as simply “intersubunit” interactions, unless otherwise stated. These intersubunit interactions consist of: 1) an NH2-terminal interface primarily between helices A and E, 2) interaction between helix E and the β-loop between β2 and β3 strands (β2/β3-loop), and 3) the burying of the COOH-terminal helix N in a hydrophobic pocket of the adjacent subunit (8Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 12Van Duyne G.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

In this article we studied the functions of the Cre residues that contact the lox spacer region and/or are involved in intersubunit protein-protein interactions. We find that the mutations of these residues have variable effects on recombination and have divided them into three groups (Table I): 1) those that have moderate impairment of recombination and accumulate Holliday intermediates, 2) those that fail to carry out synapsis, and 3) those that are catalytically inactive.Table ICharacteristics of Cre mutant proteins with loxP substratesProteinHistag?aN, no tag; Y, has an NH2-terminal His10-tag.BindingCleavagedOverall efficiency of cleavage on the top strand (CS-Top) and bottom strand (CS-Bottom) suicide substrates (24).RecombinationcHO, higher order/synaptic complex.Resolution of χ (2nd SX)fThe resolution of synthetic χP (28).Phasing LmingLmin, the linker length at minimum relative mobility in the phasing analysis of loxP in the forward orientation (19).

To identify other amino acids that may regulate the Cre reaction, we changed additional Cre residues that interact with the lox spacer region and/or are involved in intersubunit interactions. Most of the Cre mutant proteins we studied were fused to an NH2-terminal His10-tag. We showed previously that the Hiswild-type Cre protein is proficient in recombination and behaves similarly to the untagged wild-type protein in all the assays described here (19Lee L. Chu L.C.

The Cre mutant proteins were tested at the same concentration in various aspects of the recombination reactions. All the proteins examined were able to bind to both the loxP site (Fig. 2a) and the lox4 site (Fig. 2b), suggesting that the mutations did not drastically disrupt the overall protein fold. However, we cannot exclude subtle differences in protein stability or conformation that may have contributed to some of the phenotypes. The phenotypes of the Cre variants are summarized in Tables I and II. The proteins were categorized into three groups based on their ability to synapse, cleave DNA, and form and resolve Holliday junctions.Table IICharacteristics of Cre mutant proteins with lox4 substratesProteinaTable legend similar to Table I.Histag?BindingCleavageRecombinationResolution of χ (2nd SX)hPhasing LmincI & cIIHORecombinantsFormation of χ (1st SX)cIcIIWild typeN&Y++++++++++++++++++115.3116.1Group IR100AY+++++++++++++++++115.3115.9R1001AY++++++++++++++115.4116.1R106AY+++++++++++++++115.6115.9N111AY+++++++++++++++++115.5116.1R121AY++++++++++++++++115.3116.0Group IIR118AY+++++++++++*115.2116.0K122AY+++++++++++++*115.0116.0A36VN+++−−−−+++115.4116.1Group IIIQ133HY++++++−−−−NDcNot done.NDK201AN+++++−−−−*115.3116.4b Synthetic χ4 (28Lee L.

Group I Proteins (R100A, R101A, R106A, N111A, and R121A) Are Partially Impaired in Recombination and Accumulate Holliday Intermediates—A cluster of NH2-terminal arginine residues (Arg-100, Arg-101, Arg-106, and Arg-121) in the cleaving Cre subunit, but not in the non-cleaving Cre subunit, directly contact the phosphate backbone of the continuous strand opposite the activated scissile phosphate in the lox spacer region (Fig. 1, b-d) (10Guo F.

To examine the functions of these asymmetric DNA contacts, these residues were mutated to Ala. Cre R100A, R101A, R106A, and R121A were moderately defective in recombination, strand cleavage and resolution, and are classified together in Group I (Table I). These proteins bound efficiently to loxP and formed higher order (HO) synaptic complex (Fig. 2a). However, the proteins caused the central region of the loxP spacer to become sensitive to OP-Cu, similar to the footprint induced by Cre K86A (data not shown) (19Lee L. Chu L.C. Sadowski P.D. J.

The enhanced sensitivity to OP-Cu suggests that these Cre mutant proteins may bind the spacer region with slightly lower affinity than wild-type Cre due to the disruption of the DNA contacts. Recombination between loxP sites ranges from a 20% reduction in efficiency for R100A to an 80% reduction for R101A (Fig. 3, a and b). Similar results were obtained for excisive recombination between directly oriented loxP sites (data not shown). Nevertheless, the proteins were proficient in generating Holliday intermediates and in fact, three of them (R101A, R106A, and R121A) accumulated twice the amount of Holliday intermediates as the wild-type Cre protein. All four of these mutant proteins were also able to cleave loxP linear suicide substrates (Fig. 4) and resolve synthetic loxP Holliday structure (Fig. 5) with less than 2-fold reduction in efficiency. Note that Cre R121A actually enhanced cleavage on both strands of loxP by about 2-fold relative to the wild-type Cre protein.Fig. 4Cleavage of loxP on the top (a) or bottom (b) strand by Cre mutant proteins. 2 nm of the suicide substrate CS-Top (a) or CS-Bottom (b) was incubated with 0.5 μm of the indicated Cre protein at 30 °C for 1 h (24Lee L. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The reactions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The suicide cleavage reaction for the top strands of loxP is diagrammed to the left of the autoradiogram in a. Cleavage at the vertical arrow results in covalent attachment of the Cre protein to the 3′-end of the labeled (*) strand; the release of the dinucleotide fragment prevents religation.

Arg-101 is involved not only in a protein-DNA interaction, but also in a cross-spacer intersubunit interaction with Asn-111 (Fig. 1d) (8Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D.

The side chain of Arg-101 in the cleaving Cre subunit contacts the spacer region, but in the non-cleaving Cre subunit it forms a hydrogen bond with Asn-111 (OD1) in the adjacent cleaving Cre subunit. The mutant phenotype of Cre R101A could result from a disruption of the protein-DNA and/or protein-protein interaction. To distinguish between these two possible functions of Arg-101, we mutated Asn-111 to Ala (N111A). We found that Cre N111A can bind to loxP (Fig. 2, lane 7) and was less than 2-fold impaired in recombination (Fig. 3), placing it with the Group I mutant proteins. The N111A mutation was less deleterious than the R101A mutation (Figs. 3, 4, 5), demonstrating that the more severe R101A phenotype is not due solely to the disruption of the Arg-101-N111A interaction, and that the interaction of Arg-101 with the DNA is also important for function. We have shown previously that the wild-type Cre protein initiates recombination adjacent to the scissile G nucleotide, but preferentially resolves HJ and cleaves linear suicide substrates adjacent to the scissile A nucleotide (24Lee L. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Lee L. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31092-31098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine whether the asymmetric protein-DNA interactions in the lox spacer region contribute to the order of strand exchange and asymmetric cleavage, we isolated the Holliday intermediates generated in the recombination reaction and analyzed them by denaturing PAGE (Fig. 3c). Like those generated by the wild-type Cre protein, the Holliday intermediates generated by all five Group I Cre mutant proteins had exchanged the bottom strands of the loxP site adjacent to the scissile G nucleotide (Fig. 3c). These Cre mutant proteins als"
