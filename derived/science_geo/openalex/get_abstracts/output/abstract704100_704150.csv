https://openalex.org/W4309042619,"Morphine and fentanyl are among the most used opioid drugs that confer analgesia and unwanted side effects through both G protein and arrestin signaling pathways of μ-opioid receptor (μOR). Here, we report structures of the human μOR-G protein complexes bound to morphine and fentanyl, which uncover key differences in how they bind the receptor. We also report structures of μOR bound to TRV130, PZM21, and SR17018, which reveal preferential interactions of these agonists with TM3 side of the ligand-binding pocket rather than TM6/7 side. In contrast, morphine and fentanyl form dual interactions with both TM3 and TM6/7 regions. Mutations at the TM6/7 interface abolish arrestin recruitment of μOR promoted by morphine and fentanyl. Ligands designed to reduce TM6/7 interactions display preferential G protein signaling. Our results provide crucial insights into fentanyl recognition and signaling of μOR, which may facilitate rational design of next-generation analgesics."

We present the latest release of the Autism Speaks MSSNG resource, which includes WGS data from 5,100 individuals with ASD and 6,212 non-ASD parents and siblings (total n = 11,312). Examining a wide variety of genetic variants in MSSNG and the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC; n = 9,205), we identified ASD-associated rare variants in 718/5,100 individuals with ASD from MSSNG (14.1%) and 350/2,419 from SSC (14.5%). Considering genomic architecture, 52% were nuclear sequence-level variants, 46% were nuclear structural variants (including copy-number variants, inversions, large insertions, uniparental isodisomies, and tandem repeat expansions), and 2% were mitochondrial variants. Our study provides a guidebook for exploring genotype-phenotype correlations in families who carry ASD-associated rare variants and serves as an entry point to the expanded studies required to dissect the etiology in the ∼85% of the ASD population that remain idiopathic."
https://openalex.org/W4308834482,"Binding of arrestin to phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is crucial for modulating signaling. Once internalized, some GPCRs remain complexed with β-arrestins, while others interact only transiently; this difference affects GPCR signaling and recycling. Cell-based and in vitro biophysical assays reveal the role of membrane phosphoinositides (PIPs) in β-arrestin recruitment and GPCR-β-arrestin complex dynamics. We find that GPCRs broadly stratify into two groups, one that requires PIP binding for β-arrestin recruitment and one that does not. Plasma membrane PIPs potentiate an active conformation of β-arrestin and stabilize GPCR-β-arrestin complexes by promoting a fully engaged state of the complex. As allosteric modulators of GPCR-β-arrestin complex dynamics, membrane PIPs allow for additional conformational diversity beyond that imposed by GPCR phosphorylation alone. For GPCRs that require membrane PIP binding for β-arrestin recruitment, this provides a mechanism for β-arrestin release upon translocation of the GPCR to endosomes, allowing for its rapid recycling."
https://openalex.org/W4308834910,"Methods for acquiring spatially resolved omics data from complex tissues use barcoded DNA arrays of low- to sub-micrometer features to achieve single-cell resolution. However, fabricating such arrays (randomly assembled beads, DNA nanoballs, or clusters) requires sequencing barcodes in each array, limiting cost-effectiveness and throughput. Here, we describe a vastly scalable stamping method to fabricate polony gels, arrays of ∼1-micrometer clonal DNA clusters bearing unique barcodes. By enabling repeatable enzymatic replication of barcode-patterned gels, this method, compared with the sequencing-dependent array fabrication, reduced cost by at least 35-fold and time to approximately 7 h. The gel stamping was implemented with a simple robotic arm and off-the-shelf reagents. We leveraged the resolution and RNA capture efficiency of polony gels to develop Pixel-seq, a single-cell spatial transcriptomic assay, and applied it to map the mouse parabrachial nucleus and analyze changes in neuropathic pain-regulated transcriptomes and cell-cell communication after nerve ligation."
https://openalex.org/W4308835081,"In addition to tau and Aβ pathologies, inflammation plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Variants in APOE and TREM2 increase AD risk. ApoE4 exacerbates tau-linked neurodegeneration and inflammation in P301S tau mice and removal of microglia blocks tau-dependent neurodegeneration. Microglia adopt a heterogeneous population of transcriptomic states in response to pathology, at least some of which are dependent on TREM2. Previously, we reported that knockout (KO) of TREM2 attenuated neurodegeneration in P301S mice that express mouse Apoe. Because of the possible common pathway of ApoE and TREM2 in AD, we tested whether TREM2 KO (T2KO) would block neurodegeneration in P301S Tau mice expressing ApoE4 (TE4), similar to that observed with microglial depletion. Surprisingly, we observed exacerbated neurodegeneration and tau pathology in TE4-T2KO versus TE4 mice, despite decreased TREM2-dependent microgliosis. Our results suggest that tau pathology-dependent microgliosis, that is, TREM2-independent microgliosis, facilitates tau-mediated neurodegeneration in the presence of ApoE4."
https://openalex.org/W4308835005,"The pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is featured with extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, whose impact on the mechanical properties of the surrounding brain tissues is unclear. Microglia sense and integrate biochemical cues of the microenvironment. However, whether the microglial mechanosensing pathways influence AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here, we surveyed the elevated stiffness of Aβ-plaque-associated tissues and observed the selective upregulation of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 in Aβ-plaque-associated microglia. Piezo1 sensed the stiffness stimuli of Aβ fibrils and subsequently induced Ca2+ influx for microglial clustering, phagocytosis, and compacting of Aβ plaques. Microglia lacking Piezo1 led to the exacerbation of Aβ pathology and cognitive decline, whereas pharmacological activation of microglial Piezo1 ameliorated brain Aβ burden and cognitive impairment in 5 × FAD mice. Together, our results reveal that Piezo1, a mechanosensor of Aβ fibril stiffness in microglia, represents a potential therapeutic target for AD."
https://openalex.org/W4308958733,"Metastasis is an important factor contributing to poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer; yet, the molecular mechanism leading to this cell behavior is still not well understood. In this study, we explored the role of cysteine protease inhibitor SN (Cystatin SN, CST1) in promoting gastric cancer metastasis. We hypothesized that CST1 could regulate gastric cancer progression by regulating GPX4 and ferroptosis. Whole transcriptome sequencing suggested that the expression of CST1 was significantly increased in metastatic cancer, and high CST1 expression was correlated with a worse prognosis. Our data further confirmed that the overexpression of CST1 may significantly promote the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells in vitro and enhance liver, lung, and peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer in nude mice. Meanwhile, high expression of CST1 promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment combined with mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that CST1 could interact with GPX4, a key protein regulating ferroptosis. CST1 relieves GPX4 ubiquitination modification by recruiting OTUB1, improving GPX4 protein stability and reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby inhibiting ferroptosis and, in turn, promoting gastric cancer metastasis. Moreover, clinical data suggested that CST1 is significantly increased in peripheral blood and ascites of gastric cancer patients with metastasis; multivariate Cox regression model analysis showed that CST1 was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Overall, our results elucidated a critical pathway through which high CST1 expression protects gastric cancer cells from undergoing ferroptosis, thus promoting its progression and metastasis. CST1 may be used as a new oncological marker and potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W4308806503,"The coordination mechanism of neural innate immune responses for axon regeneration is not well understood. Here, we showed that neuronal deletion of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 sustains the IFNγ-STAT1 activity in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to promote axon regeneration after injury, independent of mTOR or STAT3. DNA-damage-induced cGAMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STINGs) activation is the functional downstream signaling. Directly activating neuronal STING by cGAMP promotes axon regeneration. In contrast to the central axons, IFNγ is locally translated in the injured peripheral axons and upregulates cGAS expression in Schwann cells and infiltrating blood cells to produce cGAMP, which promotes spontaneous axon regeneration as an immunotransmitter. Our study demonstrates that injured peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons can direct the environmental innate immune response for self-repair and that the neural antiviral mechanism can be harnessed to promote axon regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS)."
https://openalex.org/W4308834478,"The claustrum is a small subcortical structure with widespread connections to disparate regions of the cortex. However, the impact of the claustrum on cortical activity is not fully understood, particularly beyond frontal areas. Here, using optogenetics and multi-regional Neuropixels recordings from over 15,000 cortical neurons in awake mice, we demonstrate that the effect of claustrum input to the cortex differs depending on brain area, layer, and cell type. Brief claustrum stimulation, producing approximately 1 spike per claustrum neuron, affects many fast spiking (FS; putative inhibitory) but relatively fewer regular-spiking (RS; putative excitatory) cortical neurons and leads to a modest decrease in population activity in frontal cortical areas. Prolonged claustrum stimulation affects many more cortical neurons and can increase or decrease spiking activity. More excitation occurs in posterior regions and superficial layers, while inhibition predominates in frontal regions and deeper layers. These findings suggest that claustro-cortical circuits are organized into functional modules."
https://openalex.org/W4308791542,"Passive rewilding is a potential tool for expanding woodland cover and restoring biodiversity by abandoning land management and allowing natural vegetation succession to occur. Land can be abandoned to passive rewilding deliberately or due to socio-economic change. Despite abandonment being a major driver of land use change, few have studied the long-term outcomes for vegetation and biodiversity in Western Europe. Studies are also biased towards sites that are close to seed sources and favourable to woodland colonisation. In this case-study, we reconstruct a time series of passive rewilding over 33 years on 25 ha of former farmland that had been subject to soil tipping, far from woodland seed sources. Natural colonisation by shrubs and trees was surveyed at three points during the time series, using field mapping and lidar. Breeding birds were surveyed at three time points, and compared with surveys from nearby farmland. Results showed that natural colonisation of woody vegetation was slow, with open grassland dominating the old fields for two decades, and small wetlands developing spontaneously. After 33 years, thorny shrub thickets covered 53% of the site and former hedgerows became subsumed or degraded, but trees remained scarce. However, the resulting habitat mosaic of shrubland, grassland and wetland supported a locally distinctive bird community. Farmland bird species declined as passive rewilding progressed, but this was countered by relatively more wetland birds and an increase in woodland birds, particularly songbirds, compared to nearby farmland. Alongside biodiversity benefits, shrubland establishment by passive rewilding could potentially provide ecosystem services via abundant blossom resources for pollinators, and recreation and berry-gathering opportunities for people. Although closed-canopy woodland remained a distant prospect even after 33 years, the habitat mosaic arising from passive rewilding could be considered a valuable outcome, which could contribute to nature recovery and provision of ecosystem services."
https://openalex.org/W4308903011,"Living organisms are constantly exposed to DNA damage, and optimal repair is therefore crucial. A characteristic hallmark of the response is the formation of sub-compartments around the site of damage, known as foci. Following multiple DNA breaks, the transcription factor p53 exhibits oscillations in its nuclear concentration, but how this dynamics can affect the repair remains unknown. Here, we formulate a theory for foci formation through droplet condensation and discover how oscillations in p53, with its specific periodicity and amplitude, optimize the repair process by preventing Ostwald ripening and distributing protein material in space and time. Based on the theory predictions, we reveal experimentally that the oscillatory dynamics of p53 does enhance the repair efficiency. These results connect the dynamical signaling of p53 with the microscopic repair process and create a new paradigm for the interplay of complex dynamics and phase transitions in biology."
https://openalex.org/W4308791502,"The threat of invasive species is increasing with the expansion of global trade and habitat disruption. A recent example is the establishment of fall armyworm (FAW), a noctuid moth native to the Americas, into most of the Eastern Hemisphere with projections of significant economic losses on a global scale. The species has traditionally been subdivided into two populations that differ in their propensity to use different plant hosts, a phenotype with clear relevance for identifying crops at risk. However, inconsistencies in the genetic and phenotypic descriptions of these ""host strains"" has led to controversy about their composition and even existence. In this study, the locus for the Triosephosphate isomerase gene (Tpi) is used both as a host strain marker and for phylogenetic analysis. Association of the host choice phenotype with the Tpi-derived phylogenetic tree uncovered genetic differentiation between populations that supports the existence of the host strains and provided evidence that they are subject to different selection pressures. This correspondence of differential host use with Tpi was demonstrated for populations from a broad geographical range and supports the involvement of one or more Z-chromosome functions controlling the phenotype. Comparisons of collections from multiple locations identified significant differences in the efficacy of different molecular markers that implicate regional variations in host strain behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4308600877,"The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays pivotal roles in various biological processes during embryogenesis and adult homeostasis. Transmembrane anterior posterior transformation 1 (TAPT1) is an evolutionarily conserved protein involved in murine axial skeletal patterning. Genetic defects in TAPT1 result in complex lethal osteochondrodysplasia. However, the specific cellular activity of TAPT1 is not clear. Herein, we report that TAPT1 inhibits BMP signaling and destabilizes the SMAD1/5 protein by facilitating its interaction with SMURF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which leads to SMAD1/5 proteasomal degradation. In addition, we found that the activation of BMP signaling facilitates the redistribution of TAPT1 and promotes its association with SMAD1. TAPT1-deficient murine C2C12 myoblasts or C3H/10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells exhibit elevated SMAD1/5/9 protein levels, which amplifies BMP activation, in turn leading to a boost in the transdifferentiation or differentiation processing of these distinct TAPT1-deficient cell lines changing into mature osteoblasts. Furthermore, the enhancing effect of TAPT1 deficiency on osteogenic differentiation of C3H/10T1/2 cells was observed in an in vivo ectopic bone formation model. Importantly, a subset of TAPT1 mutations identified in humans with lethal skeletal dysplasia exhibited gain-of-function activity on SMAD1 protein levels. Thus, this finding elucidates the role of TAPT1 in the regulation of SMAD1/5 protein stability for controlling BMP signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4308601298,"Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1; also called ADGRB1 or B1) is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor known from studies on macrophages to bind to phosphatidylserine (PS) on apoptotic cells via its N-terminal thrombospondin repeats. A separate body of work has shown that B1 regulates postsynaptic function and dendritic spine morphology via signaling pathways involving Rac and Rho. However, it is unknown if PS binding by B1 has any effect on the receptor's signaling activity. To shed light on this subject, we studied G protein-dependent signaling by B1 in the absence and presence of coexpression with the PS flippase ATP11A in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. ATP11A expression reduced the amount of PS exposed extracellularly and also strikingly reduced the signaling activity of coexpressed full-length B1 but not a truncated version of the receptor lacking the thrombospondin repeats. Further experiments with an inactive mutant of ATP11A showed that the PS flippase function of ATP11A was required for modulation of B1 signaling. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we made the surprising finding that ATP11A not only modulates B1 signaling but also forms complexes with B1. Parallel studies in which PS in the outer leaflet was reduced by an independent method, deletion of the gene encoding the endogenous lipid scramblase anoctamin 6 (ANO6), revealed that this manipulation also markedly reduced B1 signaling. These findings demonstrate that B1 signaling is modulated by PS exposure and suggest a model in which B1 serves as a PS sensor at synapses and in other cellular contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4308616326,"In the conventional secretory pathway, cargo receptors play important roles in exporting newly synthesized secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We previously showed that a cargo receptor, surfeit locus protein 4 (SURF4), promotes ER export of a soluble signaling molecule, sonic hedgehog, via recognizing the polybasic residues within its Cardin-Weintraub motif. In addition to sonic hedgehog, we found 30 more secretory proteins containing the polybasic motif (K/R)(K/R)(K/R)XX(K/R)(K/R), but whether SURF4 plays a general role in mediating ER export of these secretory proteins is unclear. Here, we analyzed the trafficking of four of these secretory proteins: desert hedgehog, Indian hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 8A (BMP8A), and secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1). We found that the polybasic motifs contained in these cargo proteins are important for their ER export. Further analyses indicated that the polybasic motifs of BMP8A and SFRP1 interact with the triacidic motif on the predicted first luminal domain of SURF4. These interactions with SURF4 are essential and sufficient for the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of BMP8A and SFRP1. Moreover, we demonstrated that SURF4 localizes at a subpopulation of ER exit sites to regulate the ER export of its clients. Taken together, these results suggest that SURF4 is recruited to specific ER exit sites and plays a general role in capturing polybasic motif-containing secretory cargo proteins through electrostatic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4308791328,"At traffic hubs, it is important to avoid congestion of pedestrian streams to ensure safety and a good level of service. This presents a challenge, since distributing crowds on different routes is much more difficult than opening valves to, for example, regulate fluid flow. Humans may or may not comply with re-directions suggested to them typically with the help of signage, loudspeakers, apps, or by staff. This remains true, even if they perceive and understand the suggestions. Yet, simulation studies so far have neglected the influence of compliance. In view of this, we complement a state-of-the-art model of crowd motion and crowd behavior, so that we can vary the compliance rate. We consider an abstracted scenario that is inspired by a metro station in the city of Munich, where traffic regulators wish to make some passengers abandon the obviously shortest route so that the flow evens out. We investigate the effect of compliance for two very simple guiding strategies. In the first strategy, we alternate routes. In the second strategy, we recommend the path with the lowest crowd density. We observe that, in both cases, it suffices to reroute a small fraction of the crowd to reduce travel times. But we also find that taking densities into account is much more efficient when facing low compliance rates."
https://openalex.org/W4308791337,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disorder and a major cause of disability in the elderly population. WNT16 has been suggested to play important roles in joint formation, bone homeostasis and OA development, but the mechanism of action is not clear. Transgenic mice lacking Wnt16 expression ( Wnt16 -/- ) have a more severe experimental OA than control mice. In addition, Wnt16 -/- mice have a reduced cortical thickness and develop spontaneous fractures. Herein, we have used Cre-Wnt16 flox/flox mice in which Wnt16 can be conditionally ablated at any age through tamoxifen-inducible Cre-mediated recombination. Wnt16 deletion was induced in 7-week-old mice to study if the Cre-Wnt16 flox/flox mice have a more severe OA phenotype after destabilizing the medial meniscus (DMM surgery) than littermate controls with normal Wnt16 expression ( Wnt16 flox/flox ). WNT16 deletion was confirmed in articular cartilage and cortical bone in Cre-Wnt16 flox/flox mice, shown by immunohistochemistry and reduced cortical bone area compared to Wnt16 flox/flox mice. After DMM surgery, there was no difference in OA severity in the articular cartilage in the knee joint between the Cre-Wnt16 flox/flox and Wnt16 flox/flox mice in neither female nor male mice. In addition, there was no difference in osteophyte size in the DMM-operated tibia between the genotypes. In conclusion, inactivation of Wnt16 in adult mice do not result in a more severe OA phenotype after DMM surgery. Thus, presence of WNT16 in adult mice does not have an impact on experimental OA development. Taken together, our results from Cre-Wnt16 flox/flox mice and previous results from Wnt16 -/- mice suggest that WNT16 is crucial during synovial joint establishment leading to limited joint degradation also later in life, after onset of OA. This may be important when developing new therapeutics for OA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4308791652,"Surgical site infection constitutes a serious complication in the healing process of bone fractures and has been associated with increases in medical resource use and healthcare costs. This study evaluates the economic impact of surgical site infection in tibial fractures in a Spanish cohort. It is a retrospective, single-centre, comparative cohort study of patients with tibial fractures with longitudinal follow-up for up to 18 months post-surgery. Included patients (n = 325) were adults, with tibial fracture, either isolated or polyfracture, or polytrauma with an Injury Severity Score &gt;15. Patients had been surgically treated within 30 days of the tibial fracture by external or internal fixation, or external followed by internal fixation. Most patients (84.9%) had an American Society of Anaesthesiology score of 1-2. 20% of the patients had one open tibial fracture, 12.3% had polytrauma, and 20% had multiple fractures. Most patients were treated with a nail (41.8%) or a plate (33.8%). 56 patients (17.2%) developed surgical site infection. Patients with infection had significantly higher hospital length of stay (34.9 vs 12.0 days; p&lt;0.001; +191%), readmissions (1.21 vs 0.25; p&lt;0.001; +380%) and mean operating theatre time (499 vs 219 min; p&lt;0.001; +128%) than patients without infection. Mean length of stay in intensive care did not significantly increase with infection (2.8 vs 1.7 days; p = 0.25). Total in-hospital costs for patients with infection increased from €7,607 to €17,538 (p&lt;0.001; +131%). Overall, infections were associated with significantly increased healthcare resource use and costs. Preventive strategies to avoid infections could lead to substantial cost savings."
https://openalex.org/W4308793356,"Theoretical work suggests that collective spatiotemporal behavior of integral membrane proteins should be modulated by boundary lipids sheathing their membrane anchors. Here, we show evidence for this prediction while investigating the mechanism for maintaining a steady amount of the active form of integral membrane protein Lck kinase (LckA) by Lck trans-autophosphorylation regulated by the phosphatase CD45. We used super-resolution microscopy, flow cytometry, and pharmacological and genetic perturbation to gain insight into the spatiotemporal context of this process. We found that LckA is generated exclusively at the plasma membrane, where CD45 maintains it in a ceaseless dynamic equilibrium with its unphosphorylated precursor. Steady LckA shows linear dependence, after an initial threshold, over a considerable range of Lck expression levels. This behavior fits a phenomenological model of trans-autophosphorylation that becomes more efficient with increasing LckA. We then challenged steady LckA formation by genetically swapping the Lck membrane anchor with structurally divergent ones, such as that of Src or the transmembrane domains of LAT, CD4, palmitoylation-defective CD4 and CD45 that were expected to drastically modify Lck boundary lipids. We observed small but significant changes in LckA generation, except for the CD45 transmembrane domain that drastically reduced LckA due to its excessive lateral proximity to CD45. Comprehensively, LckA formation and maintenance can be best explained by lipid bilayer critical density fluctuations rather than liquid-ordered phase-separated nanodomains, as previously thought, with ""like/unlike"" boundary lipids driving dynamical proximity and remoteness of Lck with itself and with CD45."
https://openalex.org/W4308889189,"Yeast VH1-related phosphatase (YVH1) (also known as DUSP12) is a member of the atypical dual-specificity phosphatase subfamily. Although no direct substrate has been firmly established, human YVH1 (hYVH1) has been shown to protect cells from cellular stressors, regulate the cell cycle, disassemble stress granules, and act as a 60S ribosome biogenesis factor. Despite knowledge of hYVH1 function, further research is needed to uncover mechanisms of its regulation. In this study, we investigate cellular effects of a Src-mediated phosphorylation site at Tyr179 on hYVH1. We observed that this phosphorylation event attenuates localization of hYVH1 to stress granules, enhances shuttling of hYVH1 to the nucleus, and promotes hYVH1 partitioning to the 60S ribosomal subunit. Quantitative proteomics reveal that Src coexpression with hYVH1 reduces formation of ribosomal species that represent stalled intermediates through the alteration of associating factors that mediate translational repression. Collectively, these results implicate hYVH1 as a novel Src substrate and provide the first demonstrated role of tyrosine phosphorylation regulating the activity of a YVH1 ortholog. Moreover, the ribosome proteome alterations point to a collaborative function of hYVH1 and Src in maintaining translational fitness."
https://openalex.org/W4308889663,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder associated with the intracellular aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn). Cytotoxicity is mainly associated with the oligomeric species (αSOs) formed at early stages in α-syn aggregation. Consequently, there is an intense focus on the discovery of novel inhibitors such as peptides to inhibit oligomer formation and toxicity. Here, using peptide arrays, we identified nine peptides with high specificity and affinity for αSOs. Of these, peptides p194, p235, and p249 diverted α-syn aggregation from fibrils to amorphous aggregates with reduced β-structures and increased random coil content. However, they did not reduce αSO cytotoxicity and permeabilization of large anionic unilamellar vesicles. In parallel, we identified a non-self-aggregating peptide (p216), derived from the cell-penetrating peptide penetratin, which showed 12-fold higher binding affinity to αSOs than to α-syn monomers (Kdapp 2.7 and 31.2 μM, respectively). p216 reduced αSOs-induced large anionic unilamellar vesicle membrane permeability at 10-1 to 10-3 mg/ml by almost 100%, was not toxic to SH-SY5Y cells, and reduced αSOs cytotoxicity by about 20%. We conclude that p216 is a promising starting point from which to develop peptides targeting toxic αSOs in Parkinson's disease."

https://openalex.org/W4308616321,"The first step in transfer RNA (tRNA) maturation is the cleavage of the 5' end of precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) catalyzed by ribonuclease P (RNase P). RNase P is either a ribonucleoprotein complex with a catalytic RNA subunit or a protein-only RNase P (PRORP). In most land plants, algae, and Euglenozoa, PRORP is a single-subunit enzyme. There are currently no inhibitors of PRORP for use as tools to study the biological function of this enzyme. Therefore, we screened for compounds that inhibit the activity of a model PRORP from A. thaliana organelles (PRORP1) using a high throughput fluorescence polarization cleavage assay. Two compounds, gambogic acid and juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione) that inhibit PRORP1 in the 1 μM range were identified and analyzed. We found these compounds similarly inhibit human mtRNase P, a multisubunit protein enzyme and are 50-fold less potent against bacterial RNA-dependent RNase P. Our biochemical measurements indicate that gambogic acid is a rapid-binding, uncompetitive inhibitor targeting the PRORP1-substrate complex, while juglone acts as a time-dependent PRORP1 inhibitor. Additionally, X-ray crystal structures of PRORP1 in complex with juglone demonstrate the formation of a covalent complex with cysteine side chains on the surface of the protein. Finally, we propose a model consistent with the kinetic data that involves juglone binding to PRORP1 rapidly to form an inactive enzyme-inhibitor complex and then undergoing a slow step to form an inactive covalent adduct with PRORP1. These inhibitors have the potential to be developed into tools to probe PRORP structure and function relationships."
https://openalex.org/W4308741499,"Crosstalk between muscle fibers and immune cells is well known in the processes of muscle repair after exercise, especially resistance exercise. In aerobic exercise, however, this crosstalk is not fully understood. In the present study, we found that macrophages, especially anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages, and neutrophils accumulated in skeletal muscles of mice 24 h after a single bout of an aerobic exercise. The expression of oncostatin M (OSM), a member of the interleukin 6 family of cytokines, was also increased in muscle fibers immediately after the exercise. In addition, we determined that deficiency of OSM in mice inhibited the exercise-induced accumulation of M2 macrophages and neutrophils, whereas intramuscular injection of OSM increased these immune cells in skeletal muscles. Furthermore, the chemokines related to the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils were induced in skeletal muscles after aerobic exercise, which were attenuated in OSM-deficient mice. Among them, CC chemokine ligand 2, CC chemokine ligand 7, and CXC chemokine ligand 1 were induced by OSM in skeletal muscles. Next, we analyzed the direct effects of OSM on the skeletal muscle macrophages, because the OSM receptor β subunit was expressed predominantly in macrophages in the skeletal muscle. OSM directly induced the expression of these chemokines and anti-inflammatory markers in the skeletal muscle macrophages. From these findings, we conclude that OSM is essential for aerobic exercise-induced accumulation of M2 macrophages and neutrophils in the skeletal muscle partly through the regulation of chemokine expression in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W4308791555,"There is some data regarding lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) cultural competency among healthcare professionals. While few studies have indicated differences in competency between heterosexual and sexual minority professionals, no known studies have assessed LGBT cultural competency among diverse groups with multiple minority identities. This study aimed to characterize healthcare professionals' LGBT cultural competency by comparing twelve different demographically diverse healthcare professional groups based on gender identity, sexual orientation, and race.Deidentified data (N = 2254) was aggregated from three independent studies (i.e., healthcare professional students, psychiatry residents, and dementia care providers). A series of multivariate analyses of covariance were conducted with groups (based on gender identity, sexual orientation, and race), other demographic variables as independent variables, and LGBT-Development of Clinical Skills Scale scores (Overall LGBT-DOCSS, Clinical Preparedness, Attitudinal Awareness, and Basic Knowledge) as dependent variables.Compared to men, women reported significantly higher LGBT-DOCSS scores, except significantly lower Clinical Preparedness. Compared to cisgender, heterosexual professionals, cisgender, sexual minority professionals and gender minority professionals reported significantly higher LGBT-DOCSS scores. There were several other differences among groups, such as heterosexual, cisgender, White/Caucasian men reporting low LGBT-DOCSS scores but high Clinical Preparedness; heterosexual, cisgender, White/Caucasian women with high LGBT-DOCSS scores except Clinical Preparedness; heterosexual, racial minority professionals with low LGBT-DOCSS scores; and gender, sexual, and racial minority professionals with the highest LGBT-DOCSS scores.There are subtle, yet important, differences in LGBT cultural competency among healthcare professionals. More diversity, intersectionality, and multiple minority identities appear to lead to higher competency. Appreciating these gender, sexual, and racial minority professionals' unique perspectives may promote the development of better, more culturally affirming LGBT health education."

While recent policy and legislative changes have enabled health practitioners to prescribe CBMs for their patients, many patients still struggle to access CBMs. This paper employed a thematic analysis to submissions made to a 2019 Australian government inquiry into current barriers of patient access to medical cannabis.We identified 121 submissions from patients or family members (n = 63), government bodies (n = 5), non-government organisations (i.e., professional health bodies, charities, consumer organisations or advocacy groups; n = 25), medical cannabis and pharmaceutical industry (n = 16), and individual health professionals, academics, or research centres (n = 12).

The findings were presented narratively using a modified Levesque's patient-centred access to care framework which includes: i) appropriateness; ii) availability and geographic accessibility; iii) acceptability; and iv) affordability.Submissions from government agencies and professional health bodies consistently supported maintaining the current regulatory frameworks and access pathways, whereas an overwhelming majority of patients, advocacy groups and the medical cannabis industry described the current regulatory and access models as 'not fit for purpose'. These differing views seem to arise from divergent persepctives on (i) what and how much evidence is needed for policy and practice, and (ii) how patients should be given access to medical cannabis products amidst empirical uncertainty. Notwithstanding these differences, there were commonalities among some stakeholders regarding the various supply, regulatory, legislative, financial, and dispensing challenges that hindered timely access to CBMs.Progress in addressing the fundamental barriers that determine if and how a patient accesses and uses CBMs needs i) a 'system-level' reform that gives due consideration to the geographic disparity in access to prescribers and medical cannabis, and ii) reframing societal and health professional's views of CBMs by decoupling recreational vs medical cannabis."

This study included 156 Asian adult patients who underwent bedside PICC placement at three hospitals from September 2021 to March 2022. The shortest straight-line distance from the cubital crease to the puncture point (CP) was measured first. Using the formula of a previous study, the CP + estimated PICC length (eCL) was calculated with the parameters measured on AP-CXR. The formula was as follows: 19.409 + 0.424 × (MHTD, maximal horizontal thoracic diameter) + 0.287 × (CL, clavicle length) + 0.203 × (DTV, distance of thoracic vertebrae) + (2VBUs, two vertebral body units below the carina inferior border) (if from the left, 3.063cm was added; if female, 0.997cm was subtracted). Catheters were pretrimmed according to calculated eCL prior to the procedure. Technical success was evaluated, and the validation success of catheter length prediction was classified according to the catheter tip position as follows: optimal position or suboptimal position. Technical success was achieved in 153 cases (98.1%). Evaluation of validation success revealed that the position was “optimal” in 108 cases (70.6%) and “suboptimal” in 45 cases (29.4%). There was no validation failure. There was no case where the catheter was inserted too deep as to wedge into the right atrial wall. In conclusion, the PICC could be positioned accurately using the formula based on only AP-CXR. Furthermore, this bedside procedure was technically feasible."

https://openalex.org/W4308844150,"The success of vision transformers (ViTs) has given rise to their application in classification tasks of small environmental microorganism (EM) datasets. However, due to the lack of multi-scale feature maps and local feature extraction capabilities, the pure transformer architecture cannot achieve good results on small EM datasets. In this work, a novel hybrid model is proposed by combining the transformer with a convolution neural network (CNN). Compared to traditional ViTs and CNNs, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance when trained on small EM datasets. This is accomplished in two ways. 1) Instead of the original fixed-size feature maps of the transformer-based designs, a hierarchical structure is adopted to obtain multi-scale feature maps. 2) Two new blocks are introduced to the transformer's two core sections, namely the convolutional parameter sharing multi-head attention block and the local feed-forward network block. The ways allow the model to extract more local features compared to traditional transformers. In particular, for classification on the sixth version of the EM dataset (EMDS-6), the proposed model outperforms the baseline Xception by 6.7 percentage points, while being 60 times smaller in parameter size. In addition, the proposed model also generalizes well on the WHOI dataset (accuracy of 99%) and constitutes a fresh approach to the use of transformers for visual classification tasks based on small EM datasets."

https://openalex.org/W4308889666,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters are large, polytopic membrane proteins that exhibit astonishing promiscuity for their transport substrates. These transporters unidirectionally efflux thousands of structurally and functionally distinct compounds.

However, the structure–function relationship of these conserved gates and gating regions are not well characterized. In this study, we combine recent single-molecule, cryo-EM data with genetic and biochemical analyses of residues in the gating region of the yeast multidrug transporter Pdr5, the founding member of a large group of clinically relevant asymmetric ABC efflux pumps. Unlike the symmetric ABCG2 efflux gate, the Pdr5 counterpart is highly asymmetric, with only four (instead of six) residues comprising the gate proper. However, other residues in the near vicinity are essential for the gating activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that residues in the gate and in the gating regions have multiple functions. For example, we show that Ile-685 and Val-1372 are required not only for successful efflux but also for allosteric inhibition of Pdr5 ATPase activity.

In the inward-facing (IF) conformation of the multidrug-exporting subfamily, which is observed in multiple X-ray and single-particle cryo-EM structures, substrates bind to residues in a large pocket with relatively high affinity. Recently, a detailed structural analysis of the TmrAB asymmetric multidrug transporter was performed under turnover conditions (1Hofmann S.H. Januliene D. Mehdipour A.R. Thomas C. Brucher S. Kuhn B.T. et al.Conformation of a heterodimeric ABC exporter under turnover conditions.Nature. 2019; 571: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The results from this study strongly suggest that ATP binding and dimerization of nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) trigger a switch from the IF conformation to the outward-facing (OF, drug-releasing) conformation. ATP hydrolysis then returns the transporter to the drug-binding conformation. A comparison of structural and mechanistic properties of several ABC transporters is the subject of a recent extensive review (2Thomas C. Tampe R. Structure and mechanistic principles of ABC transporters.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2020; 86: 605-636Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Single-particle cryo-EM structures of the mammalian transporter ABCG2 identified Gly-553, Leu-554, and Leu-555 as part of a hydrophobic plug or gate (3Manolaridis I. Jackson S. Taylor N. Kowal N. Stahlberg H. Locher K.P. Cryo-EM structures of a human ABCG2 mutant trapped in ATP-bound and substrate-bound states.Nature. 2018; 563: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) that separates the inner and outer transport substrate-binding pockets during a two-step export process. The structure of this transporter, along with that of the asymmetric ABCG5/G8 sterol transporter (4Lee J.-Y. Kinch L.M. Borek D.H. Wang D.J. Wang J. Urbatsch I.L. et al.Crystal structure of the human sterol transporter ABCG5/ABCG8.Nature. 2016; 533: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), is particularly relevant to Pdr5. Although Pdr5 is the founding member of its own subfamily of fungal ABC efflux pumps, it has a structure similar to the ABCG members, especially those that are asymmetric. Pdr5 has a characteristically reverse orientation of NBDs and transmembrane-binding domains (TMDs). The atomic structures of the mammalian ABCG family members reveal a cis conformation of intracellular loops and the NBD Q-loop. Thus, intracellular loop 2 contacts the N-terminal Q-loop, in contrast to members of other ABC subfamilies, where the orientation is trans. Although there were no crystal structures of any ABCG transporters at the time, suppressor genetics performed on Pdr5 clearly indicated a cis orientation for this efflux pump (5Ananthaswamy N. Rutledge R. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Dine E. Nelson E. et al.The signaling interface of the yeast multidrug transporter Pdr5 adopts a cis configuration and there are functional overlap and equivalence of the deviant and canonical Q- loop residues.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4440-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This feature was confirmed in a recent structural study (6Harris A. Wagner M. Du D. Raschka S. Gohlke H. Smits S.H.J.V. et al.Structure and efflux mechanism of the yeast pleiotropic drug resistance transporter Pdr5.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Single-particle cryo-EM structures of Pdr5 in the IF and OF state were described, as well as an IF conformation with bound nucleotides and the rhodamine 6G (R6G) ligand. Pdr5 is an extreme case of ABC transporter asymmetry: all conserved sequence motifs that make up nucleotide-binding site 1 (NBS1; Walker A, Walker B, and H-loop of NBD1, as well as the C-loop of NBD2) contain amino acid substitutions of the catalytically relevant residues (discussion in Golin and Ambudkar, 7). Thus, one NBS is incapable of significant ATP hydrolysis (8Ernst R. Kueppers P. Klein C.M. Schwarzmueller T. Kuchler K. Schmitt L. A mutation of the H-loop selectively affects rhodamine transport by the yeast multidrug transporter Pdr5.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5069-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The asymmetry is also reflected in the structures. NBS1 contains either no nucleotide or ATP, while the active NBS, NBS2, contains ADP in the IF conformation or ADP∗Vi in the OF state. In all the structures examined, only a cis interaction between one NBD and one TMD is present in the structures, only one coupling helix per TMD is present, and the domain swapping seen in structures of the ABCB subfamily is absent. Interactions occur between coupling-helix 1 (the loop between transmembrane-helix 2 (TMH2) and TMH3) and the Q-loop of NBD1 and on the opposite site of the protein between coupling-helix 2 (the loop between TMH8 and TMH9) and the Q-loop of NBD2. It is primarily TMD1 that undergoes changes during the switch from IF to OF that underlies the transport cycle. This switch results in a peristaltic motion that squeezes out the bound substrate from its binding site in the IF conformation into the exit channel and releases the substrate at the outer leaflet–extracellular space interface. This suggests that substrates are not released into the aqueous medium but rather repartition into the outer leaflet of the membrane (9Higgins C.F. Gottesman M.M. Is the multidrug transporter a flippase?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 10Raschka S.L. Harris A. Luisi B.F. Schmitt L. Flipping and other astonishing transporter dance moves in fungal drug resistance.Bioessays. 2022; 4e2200035Google Scholar). The reduction in substrate affinity of the OF conformation is not enough to preclude reflux of substrates following expulsion. For example, the reduction in binding affinity measured in P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was only about 30-fold (11Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Evidence for a requirement for ATP hydrolysis at two distinct steps during a single turnover of the catalytic cycle of human P-glycoprotein.Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Partly because of this observation, a gate or molecular diode was proposed for ABC transporters (12Gupta R.P. Kueppers P. Schmitt L. Ernst R. The multidrug transporter Pdr5, a molecular diode?.Biol. Chem. 2011; 391: 53-60Google Scholar). The first functional evidence for a molecular diode was described in the yeast multidrug transporter Pdr5 and the mammalian TAP antigen transporter (13Mehla J. Ernst R. Moore R. Wakschlag A. Marquis M.K. Ambudkar S.V. et al.Evidence for a diode-based mechanism in a multispecific ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporter Pdr5.J. Biol.

However, considerable reflux of R6G occurred during transport. Elegant work with the TAP transporter demonstrated a gating function that required the D-loop and presumably the same signal transmission pathway used to ferry processed antigen peptides (14Grossmann N. Vakkasoglu A.S. Hulpke S. Abele R. Gaudet R. Tampé R. Mechanistic determinants of the directionality and energetics of active export by a heterodimeric ABC transporter.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This D-loop mutant converted TAP from an active transporter into a facilitator. In this study, we further explored the features of the Pdr5 extrusion gate. Ser-1368 lies in the middle of TMH-11, which is split into three separate helices and lines the R6G-binding site. Ser-1368 is in TMH11a, while TMH11c crosses over to the second extracellular domain-2, which contains two conserved disulfide bridges. When the structures of Pdr5 and ABCG2 are superimposed, Ser-1368 is near the Leu-554 and Leu-555 plug. The ABCG2 gate also includes Gly-553. The residues in Pdr5 corresponding to the two Leu residues are Val-1372 and Met-1373 (Fig. 1A). A bioinformatic analysis of the Pdr subfamily (15Lamping E. Baret P.V. Holmes A.R. Monk B.C. Goffeau A. Cannon R. Fungal PDR transporters: Phylogeny, topology, motifs, and function.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2010; 47: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrated that amino acids in this vicinity are highly conserved (Fig. 1B). These include Phe-1369, Gly-1371, Val-1372, and Met-1373. Val-1372 and Met-1373 are the first two residues in extracellular loop 6. We also made an alignment between ABCG2 and 17 other members of the ABCG subfamily with 41% to 73% amino acid identity. The residues corresponding to Phe-1369 and Gly-1371 of Pdr5 are also highly conserved. Both residues were present in 16 of the 17 sampled ABCG sequences. A similar set of residues in the N-terminal half of Pdr5 extends from Tyr-680 to Ile-685 (Fig. 1C). Residues Gly-682, Phe-683, and Ala-684 are equivalent to Gly-1371, Val-1372, and Met-1373. Ala-684 is not conserved in the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) subfamily of ABC transporters. Immediately adjacent is the highly conserved Ile-685 residue. This study analyzes the role of these amino acids in Pdr5. The Pdr5 gate is asymmetric. In contrast to ABCG2, four rather than six residues are involved. Furthermore, our results suggest that gate region residues play a variety of roles, including conformational switching, protein folding, and molecular gating. Surprisingly, some of the residues in the molecular gate region modulate allosteric inhibition of the Pdr5 ATPase activity by its transport substrates. The location of the ligand-binding site and the residues of Pdr5 corresponding to the Leu gate of ABCG2 as well as Ser1368, which is part of the molecular diode, are shown in Figure 2. The spatial relationships between the residues in the region of the gate are revealing. The three images in Figure 3 provide the perspective from above the extracellular space. The first picture (Fig. 3A) is a close-up view of these residues in the IF (gray) and OF (cyan) conformations, respectively. During conformational switching, the residues in amino terminal half of Pdr5 (Gly-682, Phe-683, Ala-684, Ile-685) barely move. In contrast, the residues of the carboxyl terminal half undergo significant shifts in location. The Met-1373 side chain, for instance, moves further away from the amino terminal residues and the Ser-1368 side chain moves further away from Met-1373. The result of this movement is clearly seen when comparing the IF (Fig. 3B) with the OF (Fig. 3C) surface structures in which Phe-683, Ala-684, Ile-685, Val-1372, and Met-1373 are highlighted as spheres. The gate proper comprises Gly-682, Phe-683, Gly-1371, and Met-1373. In the IF conformation, the gate is completely closed by the single pair of interacting hydrophobic residues, Phe-683 and Met-1373. The striking asymmetry of Pdr5 is apparent because bioinformatic data suggest a similar interaction between Val-1372 and either Ala-684 or Ile-685, which is not observed. The closest that Ile-685 gets to a residue on the opposite side of the efflux channel is a 7.1 Å distance from Met-1373 (Fig. S1). This is notably different from the homodimeric ABCG2 gate, where Leu-554 and Leu-555 from each side create a hydrophobic plug. When Pdr5 is in the OF conformation (Fig. 3C), the channel space is 11 Å. Because a benzene ring is roughly 2.8 Å in diameter and effective Pdr5 transport substrates are always larger than this (16Golin J. Ambudkar S.V. Gottesman M.M. Habib A.D. Sczepanski J. Ziccardi W. et al.Studies with novel Pdr5 substrates demonstrate a strong size dependence for xenobiotic efflux.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5963-5969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it seemed possible that the transport substrates could be in contact with the gating residues during efflux, a conclusion strongly supported by data obtained in this study. As noted in the recent Pdr5 structural study (6Harris A. Wagner M. Du D. Raschka S. Gohlke H. Smits S.H.J.V. et al.Structure and efflux mechanism of the yeast pleiotropic drug resistance transporter Pdr5.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), an implied peristaltic movement during conformational switching results in extrusion of transport substrates. A topology diagram showing the location of all the mutant residues analyzed in this study is found in the supporting information (Fig. S2). When we began our analysis of the Pdr5 gating region, we used a combination of bioinformatics from fungal PDR transporters and the published structure of the ABCG2 multidrug transporter to identify conserved residues Gly-682, Ile-685, Gly-1371, Val-1372, and Met-1373 as components of the Pdr5 molecular gate. We performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis to create the G682A, I685A, G1371A, V1372A, M1373A, and I685A, V132A double-mutant substitutions, which we compared to an isogenic WT control strain. It was not until much later that reexamination of the structures revealed the critical importance of Phe-683. Remarkably, F683L, A684S, and M1373T mutants were in a genetic background closely related to the one used in this study. These were previously identified as part of a genetic screen for mutants conferring FK506-resistance to fluconazole transport (17Tanabe K. Bonus M. Tomiyama S. Miyoshi K. Nagi M. Niimi K. et al.FK506 resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pdr5 and Candida albicans Cdr1 involves mutations in the transmembrane domains and extracellular loops.Antimicrob. Agent Chem. 2019; 63https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.01146-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In that study, these mutants exhibited hypersensitivity to at least some Pdr5 transport substrates. Therefore, we characterized these mutants with similar methods to those used for the others in this study. Because these critical mutants were not alanine substitutions and our methods had minor differences, we present these results first in a separate section. In the original characterization of these strains, the F683L mutant was profoundly hypersensitive to R6G; its minimum inhibitory concentration was just one-eighth of the WT value. It was also hypersensitive to cycloheximide and fluconazole. The A684S and M1373T mutants were also hypersensitive to some of the drugs, but their phenotypes were mild relative to the F683L strain. The PDR5 gene in these strains was resequenced to verify the presence of the mutation of interest. Purified PM vesicles were prepared from these strains. A Coomassie blue–stained gel and Western blots of the vesicles indicated equivalent levels of Pdr5 in all of the preparations (Fig. S3, A and B). The ATPase activity was also examined. All of the mutants had activities that were similar to the WT control (Fig. S3C). We evaluated the sensitivity of the mutant ATPases to clotrimazole, which is known to be an allosteric inhibitor of this activity (18Golin J. Kon Z.N. Wu C.P. Martello J. Hanson L.

Agents Chemother. 2013; 57: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The inhibition curves of the mutant enzymes were not significantly different from the WT plot, with IC50 values of 2.0 to 2.8 μM (Fig. S4). These values, in turn, were much like the one reported previously for the WT enzyme, 2.2 μM (21Arya N. Rahman H. Rudrow A. Wagner M. Ambudkar S.V. Golin J.

Microbiol. 2019; 112: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In light of these results, we reexamined the relative resistance of the mutants to the drugs used in the original study (Fig. 4). The F683L mutant exhibited significant hypersensitivity to all four drugs. It was 2× to 4× more sensitive than the WT. The F683L mutant was most sensitive to R6G and least sensitive to ketoconazole. The M1373T and A684S mutants were nearly identical in phenotype, which was drug specific. They were mildly hypersensitive to cycloheximide but quite hypersensitive to ketoconazole and fluconazole. Remarkably, their resistance to R6G was indistinguishable from the WT, even though the substitution of a polar residue for a nonpolar one occurred at each position. Transport of R6G in PM vesicles was measured with a well-established assay (22Kolaczkowski M. van der Rest M. Cybularz-Kolaczkowski A. Soumillion J.-P. Konings W.N. Goffeau A.

Transport in this type of experiment is measured against a concentration gradient of R6G (Fig. 5A). Although the WT vesicles exhibit quenching kinetics much like those described previously (8Ernst R. Kueppers P. Klein C.M. Schwarzmueller T. Kuchler K. Schmitt L. A mutation of the H-loop selectively affects rhodamine transport by the yeast multidrug transporter Pdr5.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 2019; 112: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), the F683L mutant had a nearly null phenotype with little reduction in fluorescence signal. The diode-malfunctioning mutant S1368A exhibited a unique transport phenotype. It was profoundly transport deficient in an assay of efflux in whole cells against a concentration gradient of R6G. Thus, when transport was conducted for 90 min in the presence of R6G, the S1368A mutant accumulated 5× to 10× more fluorescence than did the WT. This was shown to be directly attributable to drug reflux. In contrast, when we performed a whole-cell transport assay in the direction of the gradient so that R6G was diluted in the extracellular buffer, the mutant phenotype was nearly WT (10Raschka S.L. Harris A. Luisi B.F. Schmitt L. Flipping and other astonishing transporter dance moves in fungal drug resistance.Bioessays. 2022; 4e2200035Google Scholar). We tested the F683L mutant in analogous fashion. To do this, log-phase cells were preloaded in Hepes buffer with 20 μM R6G and no additional glucose for 90 min. Under these conditions, cells continue to transport R6G until the internal pool of glucose is severely diminished, at which point R6G (as well as fluorescence) accumulates. The WT strain, though, always accumulates less fluorescence than any transport-deficient mutants. That is also the case in the present study (Fig. 5B). Thus, the ΔPdr5 strain (AD1-7) retained the most fluorescence and the F683L mutant accumulated about 3× as much as the WT control. However, when transport was conducted in the direction of an R6G gradient, the F683L mutant performed robust drug efflux (Fig. 5C). In fact, under these conditions, this mutant seemed modestly better than the WT at clearing R6G. A two-way ANOVA test indicated that the WT and F683L mutant curves were significantly different. The p value for all fixed effects was <0.001. We do not have an obvious biochemical explanation for this. It is possible that a minor genetic change unrelated to Pdr5 took place in the F683L strain that accounts for the slightly better transport kinetics. We also constructed a series of alanine substitution mutations in conserved residues in the gating region of the N- and C-halves of Pdr5. The G682A, I685A, F1369A, G1371A, V1372A, and M1373A mutations were made as previously described (5Ananthaswamy N. Rutledge R. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Dine E. Nelson E. et al.The signaling interface of the yeast multidrug transporter Pdr5 adopts a cis configuration and there are functional overlap and equivalence of the deviant and canonical Q- loop residues.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4440-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also made an I685A, V1372A double mutant. PM vesicle preparations were made from all these strains. A Coomassie-stained gel and a Western blot of the solubilized PM vesicle proteins were prepared (Fig. S5). The Coomassie blue–stained gel of the membrane preparations (Fig. S5A) indicated equivalent loading of the samples (see, for example, the Pma1 band). The presence of a highly expressed Pdr5 band was present in six of the nine samples. Densitometry revealed that the PM vesicles prepared from the I685A, V1372A, and double-mutant strains have about twice the amount of Pdr5 protein as the WT. We further confirmed this observation in a second set of preparations from the WT and double-mutant strains. The Western blot substantiated these observations (Fig. S5B). No Pdr5 protein was observed in samples from the ΔPdr5, G682A, and M1373A strains. The failure of the M1373A protein to localize to the PM membrane mirrors the behavior of its equivalent L555A mutant residue in ABCG2 (7Golin J. Ambudkar S.V. The multidrug transporter Pdr5 on the 25th anniversary of its discovery: an important model for the study of asymmetric ABC transporters.Biochem. J. 2015; 467: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We also evaluated ATPase activities in the mutants. The ATPase activity of Pdr5 follows standard Michaelis–Menten kinetics, and representative plots are illustrated in Figure 6A. The Vmax of the F1369A mutant, although on the lower end (1.8 μmol min−1 mg−1) is nevertheless within the range of activities seen for WT activities (2.5 μmol min−1 mg−1 in this plot). The G1371A activity (0.9 μmol min−1 mg−1), however, was about one-third the WT value. We also assayed two independent PM vesicle preparations for each strain at the single concentration of 3 mM ATP. The WT and F1369A mutant activities were 2.0 ± 0.4 and 1.4 ± 0.3 μmol min−1 mg−1, respectively. A t test indicated that these activities were not significantly different (p = 0.1429). The average activity from the G1371A mutant enzyme (0.6 ± 0.2 μmol min−1 mg−1) was, however, significantly lower than the WT (p = 0.0407). When we assayed the ATPase activities of the I685A, V1372A, and double-mutant PM vesicle preparations (Fig. 6B), the activities of the single mutants and double mutants were higher than the WT values. The elevated ATPase activities in these mutants almost certainly reflect the higher level of their Pdr5 protein in the PM vesicles. We tested the sensitivity of the alanine substitution mutant ATPases to inhibition by clotrimazole. Representative plots indicated that PM vesicles made from the G1371A mutant exhibited striking hypersensitivity to this transport substrate (Fig. 6C). Analogous results were obtained when bifonazole was used as an inhibitor (Fig. 6D). Markedly, different results were obtained with the single I685A and V1372A mutants and an I685A, V1372A double mutant. With clotrimazole as the inhibitor, the single mutants had IC50 values roughly 1.5× as high as the WT (Table 1). The double-mutant ATPase, however, was significantly more resistant than the single mutants’ enzymes. Testing of a second preparation of double-mutant vesicles verified these results. In this experiment, we also used higher concentrations of these inhibitors to get better estimates of the IC50 values (Fig. S6). The double-mutant value (6.3 μM) for clotrimazole was 5× as much as the WT and therefore greater than the sum of the single values. A similar phenomenon was observed with bifonazole. In this case, the single mutant IC50 values were not significantly different from the WT. The double mutant, however, had an IC50 4.5× as great. These results suggest that Ile-685 and Val-1372 are part of a site-mediating allosteric inhibition of Pdr5 ATPase activity by its transport substrates. These data are consistent with our previous observations that neither the ATP-binding sites nor the drug-binding sites in the binding pocket are the location of inhibition (18Golin J. Kon Z.N. Wu C.P. Martello J. Hanson L. Supernavage S. et al.Complete inhibition of the Pdr5 multidrug efflux pump ATPase activity by its transport substrate clotrimazoletrimazole suggests GTP as well as ATP may be used as an energy source.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13109-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Table 1Inhibition of Pdr5 ATPase activity by transport substratesSubstrateWTV1372AI685AV1372A, I685AClotrimazoleaThe IC50 values (μM) for clotr"

The rescue of the lowland subspecies and the whole species was achieved mainly thanks to individuals from the Białowieża Forest (Polish-Belarusian border). There are currently two breeding lines—the lowland (purebred B . b . Bonasus ) founded by 7 individuals and the lowland-Caucasian (hybrids of B . b . Bonasus and B . b . caucasicus ) founded by 12 individuals. This genealogical study was conducted on 15,071 individuals recorded in the pedigree book between 1881 and 2020. Its objective was to determine the level of genetic variability and inbreeding almost 100 years after the rescue measures were initiated. The completeness of the pedigree of the reference population was 77% in the fifth generation backwards. A maximum of 23 generations can be traced back in the pedigree. The average inbreeding coefficient and the mean average relatedness of the reference population were very high, about 17% and 16% respectively. No significant amount of new inbreeding was discovered. The reference population has lost 9.11% of the total genetic diversity compared to the population of founders. A male of the Caucasian subspecies Kaukasus was discovered among the ancestors of the lowland lineage reference population. The effective population size calculated based on the increase in inbreeding was 23.93 individuals, based on complete generations equivalent it was 16.1 individuals. Wright’s F-statistics showed very small differences in genotypic frequencies between individuals within the two lineages in the reference population ( F IS = 0.10), between individuals and the total population ( F IT = 0.04) and low differentiation between lineages ( F ST = 0.06). The population of the European bison from the Białowieża Forest is generally very uniform but still shows good fitness."
https://openalex.org/W4308914406,"Background While prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in high-grade prostate cancers, it is also expressed in tumor neovasculature and other malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, no functional imaging for HCC is clinically available, making diagnosis and surveillance following local therapies particularly challenging. 18 F-DCFPyL binds with high affinity to PSMA yet clears rapidly from the blood pool. PET imaging with 18 F-DCFPyL may represent a new tool for staging, surveillance and assessment of treatment response in HCC. The purpose of this Functional Imaging Liver Cancer (FLIC) trial is to assess the ability of 18 F-DCFPyL-PET/CT to detect sites of HCC. Methods This is a phase II multi-site prospective imaging trial with a plan to enroll 50 subjects with suspected HCC on standard of care CT or MRI and eligible for standard local treatment. Participants will undergo a baseline 18 F-DCFPyL-PET/CT, prior to therapy. Subjects will also be scanned with 18 F-FDG-PET/CT within 2 weeks of 18 F-DCFPyL-PET/CT. Participants will undergo histopathologic assessment and standard of care local treatment for HCC within a multidisciplinary team context. Participants with histopathologic confirmation of HCC and a positive baseline 18 F-DCFPyL-PET/CT will undergo a post-treatment 18 F-DCFPyL-PET/CT during the first routine follow-up, typically within 4–8 weeks. Subjects with negative baseline 18 F-DCFPyL-PET/CT will not be re-scanned after treatment but will remain in follow-up. Participants will be followed for 5-years to assess for progression-free-survival. The primary endpoint is the positive predictive value of 18 F-DCFPyL-PET for HCC as confirmed by histopathology. Secondary endpoints include comparison of 18 F-DCFPyL-PET/CT with CT, MRI, and 18 F-FDG-PET/CT, and evaluation of the value of 18 F-DCFPyL-PET/CT in assessing treatment response following local treatment. Exploratory endpoints include next generation sequencing of tumors, and analysis of extracellular vesicles to identify biomarkers associated with response to therapy. Discussion This is a prospective imaging trial designed to evaluate whether PSMA-PET/CT imaging with 18 F-DCFPyL can detect tumor sites, assess local treatment response in HCC patients, and to eventually determine whether PSMA-PET/CT could improve outcomes of patients with HCC receiving standard of care local therapy. Importantly, this trial may help determine whether PSMA-selective radiopharmaceutical therapies may be beneficial for patients with HCC. Clinical trial registration NIH IND#133631.

https://openalex.org/W4308914605,"The human gut ecosystem starts developing at birth and is influenced by many factors during early life. In this study we make use of a Belgian cohort of 64 children, followed until the age of 6 years, to analyze different phases of microbiota development. We analyzed fecal samples taken before weaning (age 1 month), shortly after weaning (age 6 months), when milk feeding has been discontinued completely (age 1 year), and at the age of 6 years. We performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing on the collected fecal samples and analyzed the compositional data in relation to dietary metadata and birth mode. Human and formula milk feeding promotes a microbiota dominated by either Bacteroides or Bifidobacterium, respectively. Into later life stages, the microbiota composition follows distinct microbiota clusters, related to abundance dynamics of certain bacterial groups. Furthermore, it becomes apparent that a formula diet leads to early maturation of the infant gut microbiota. Despite other clinical variables within the infant cohort, they did not significantly contribute to the microbiota patterns we observed. Our data provide a proof of principle study of the importance of diet to the development of the microbiota in early life that replicates earlier findings in other cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W4308791282,"In the last decade, Australia has experienced an overall decline in red cell demand, but there has been an increased need for phenotyped matched red cells. Lifeblood and mathematicians from Queensland universities have developed a probabilistic model to determine the percentage of the donor panel that would need extended antigen typing to meet this increasing demand, and an estimated timeline to achieve the optimum required phenotyped (genotyped) panel. Mathematical modelling, based on Multinomial distributions, was used to provide guidance on the percentage of typed donor panel needed, based on recent historical blood request data and the current donor panel size. Only antigen combinations determined to be uncommon, but not rare, were considered. Simulations were run to attain at least 95% success percentage. Modelling predicted a target of 38% of the donor panel, or 205,000 donors, would need to be genotyped to meet the current demand. If 5% of weekly returning donors were genotyped, this target would be reached within 12 years. For phenotyping, 35% or 188,000 donors would need to be phenotyped to meet Lifeblood’s demand. With the current level of testing, this would take eight years but could be performed within three years if testing was increased to 9% of weekly returning donors. An additional 26,140 returning donors need to be phenotyped annually to maintain this panel. This mathematical model will inform business decisions and assist Lifeblood in determining the level of investment required to meet the desired timeline to achieve the optimum donor panel size."

The Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC) is a national consortium that uses implementation science to identify and address barriers to care in SCD. The SCDIC seeks to understand how and why patients become unaffiliated from care and determine strategies to identify and connect patients to care. A challenge, however, is the lack of agreed-upon definition for what it means to be unaffiliated and what it means to be a ""SCD expert provider"". In this study, we conducted a Delphi process to obtain expert consensus on what it means to be an ""unaffiliated patient"" with SCD and to define an ""SCD specialist,"" as no standard definition is available. Twenty-eight SCD experts participated in three rounds of questions. Consensus was defined as 80% or more of respondents agreeing. Experts reached consensus that an individual with SCD who is unaffiliated from care is ""someone who has not been seen by a sickle cell specialist in at least a year."" A sickle cell specialist was defined as someone with knowledge and experience in SCD. Having ""knowledge"" means: being knowledgeable of the 2014 NIH Guidelines, ""Evidence-Based Management of SCD"", trained in hydroxyurea management and transfusions, trained on screening for organ damage in SCD, trained in pain management and on SCD emergencies, and is aware of psychosocial and cognitive issues in SCD. Experiences that are expected of a SCD specialist include experience working with SCD patients, mentored by a SCD specialist, regular attendance at SCD conferences, and obtains continuing medical education on SCD every 2 years."" The results have strong implications for future research, practice, and policy related to SCD by helping to lay a foundation for an new area of research (e.g., to identify subpopulations of unaffiliation and targeted interventions) and policies that support reaffiliation and increase accessibility to quality care."

Pathogenic E . coli isolates from colorectal biopsies were characterized based on phylotypes, antibiotic resistance pattern, and (Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus Sequence-based Polymerase Chain Reaction) ERIC-PCR. Furthermore, isolates were screened for the presence of the Pks (polyketide synthase) Island specifically targeting colibactin genes A and Q. The selective clb + clb + isolates were subjected to cytotoxicity assay using Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell lines. We revealed that 43.47% of the cancer-associated E . coli isolates were from phylogroup B2 comparatively more pathogenic than rest while in the case of healthy controls no isolate was found from B2. Moreover, 90% were found positive for colibactin and pks (polyketide synthase) island, while none of the healthy controls were found positive for colibactin genes. All healthy and cancer-associated isolates were tested against 15 antibiotic agents, we observed that cancer-associated isolates showed a wide range of resistance from 96% against Nalidixic acid to 48% against Doxycycline. Moreover, E . coli isolates were further genotyped using ERIC-PCR, and selected clb + clb + E . coli isolates were subjected to cytotoxicity assay.

To survive in academia, it is crucial to obtain research funding. Previous studies have investigated factors that affect the funding success of researchers. In this paper, we focus on research collaboration structure as a factor affecting funding success. More specifically, we investigate the effects of participation in joint research projects, number of joint research projects, and centrality in the collaborative network on the future funding success of junior researchers in Japan. Our results show that participation in joint research projects and the number of such projects significantly affect the future funding success of junior researchers. Furthermore, the median number of years of funding received by researchers involved in joint research projects was found to be about 1.5 times greater than that of researchers not involved in joint research projects, and the average amount of research funding received after 10 years is about 2–4 times more, suggesting that researchers with collaboration ties with other researchers in the early stages of their career tend to be more successful in the future."

However, relevant studies on ARLs in breast cancer (BC) are limited. In this research, the expression profiles, genetic variations, and prognostic values of ARLs in BC have been systematically analyzed for the first time using various databases. We find that ARLs are significantly dysregulated in BC according to the TCGA database, which may result from DNA methylation and copy number alteration. Prognostic analysis suggests that ARL11 is the most significant prognostic indicator for BC, and higher ARL11 predicts worse clinical outcomes for BC patients. Further functional enrichment analysis demonstrates that ARL11 enhances the immunosuppression in BC, and dysregulation of ARL11 is significantly associated with immune infiltration in various types of cancer. Our results demonstrate the potential of ARL11 as an immune therapeutic target for BC."

https://openalex.org/W4308791563,"Nuss surgery is effective in correcting pectus excavatum (PE), with a recurrence rate of 1.2–27%. Re-do surgery is successful but still has a 6% failure rate. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) experience repetitive PE-associated sternal depression during sleep. As the prevalence of OSA among PE patients is higher than the average, co-existing OSA in PE patients might negatively affect the efficacy of Nuss surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of co-existing OSA on Nuss surgery in patients with PE. In total, 20 adult patients with PE only and 9 patients with PE and OSA were analyzed. Polysomnography was performed before Nuss surgery to evaluate OSA. Sternovertebral distance (SVD) and radiographic Haller index (RHI) were recorded before surgery and at 3, 6, and 24 months postoperatively. The results showed that percentage changes in SVD in patients with PE only at 3, 6, and 24 months postoperatively were significantly increased compared with those in the patients with PE and OSA (31.1% vs. 14.1% at 3 months; 37.5% vs. 21.4% at 6 months; 42.5% vs. 19.2% at 24 months). Meanwhile, percentage changes in RHI were significantly lower in patients with PE alone than in the patients with PE and OSA (-22.9% vs. -9.3% at 3 months; -27.9% vs. -18.7% at 6 months; -30.6% vs. -16.7% at 24 months). This study showed that co-existing OSA might reduce the efficacy of Nuss surgery for patients with PE. We recommend that patients with PE should be evaluated and treated for OSA before surgery to prevent surgical failure after bar removal."
https://openalex.org/W4308791656,"Background In developing countries, home delivery without a skilled birth attendant is a common practice. It has been evidenced that unattended birth is linked with serious life-threatening complications for both the women and the newborn. Institutional delivery with a skilled birth assistance could reduce 20–30% of neonatal mortality. This study aimed to assess traditional birth attendants’ (TBAs) utilization and associated factors for women who gave birth in the last two years in Angolella Tara District, Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was employed among 416 women who gave birth in the last two years at rural Angolella Tara District. Study participants were recruited by using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected using a structured, pretested, and interviewer-administered questionnaire. Epi Data 4.6 and SPSS version 25 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with women’s utilization of traditional birth attendants. The level of significance in the last model was determined at a p-value of &lt;0.05. Result Overall, 131 (31.5%) participants were used traditional birth attendants in their recent birth. Unmarried marital status (AOR 2.63; 95% CI: 1.16, 5.97), age at first marriage (AOR 2.31; 95%CI: 1.30, 4.09), time to reach health facility (AOR = 3.46; 95% CI: 1.94, 6.17), know danger sign of pregnancy and childbirth (AOR = 5.59, 95% CI; 2.89, 10.81), positive attitude towards traditional birth attendants (AOR = 2.56 95% CI; 1.21,5.52), had antenatal care follow-up (AOR: 0.11 95% CI 0.058, 0.21), and listening radio (AOR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.99) were significantly associated factors with the use of traditional birth attendants. Conclusion Nearly one-third of women used traditional birth attendant services for their recent birth. TBAs availability and accessibility in the community, and respect for culture and tradition, problems regarding infrastructure, delay or unavailability of ambulance upon call, and some participants knowing only TBAs for birth assistance were reasons for preference of TBAs. Therefore, effort should be made by care providers and policymakers to ensure that modern health care services are accessible for women in a friendly and culturally sensitive manner. In addition, advocacy through mass media about the importance of maternal health service utilization, particularly antenatal care would be important."
https://openalex.org/W4308791677,"Background Metabolic syndromes (MetS) and diabetes mellitus (DM) comorbidity is a growing major global public health problem with huge morbidity and mortality. It is a pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic disorder characterized by alteration of platelet indices and increased platelet activation, however, the tendency to use them in diagnosis is not yet fully evaluated in our context and there is limited evidence on the role of platelet indices in predicting and differentiating DM+MetS comorbidity in Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate platelet indices in HC, DM, and DM+MetS, and to determine their role in the prediction of DM+MetS comorbidity risk and the distinction between DM+MetS and DM or healthy persons in southwest Ethiopia. Method and materials A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in Wolkite University specialized hospital from March to August 2021. A total of 336 study participants (112 healthy controls (HC), 112 DM, 112 DM+MetS) was included in this study. Anthropmetric data were measured and the venous blood sample was collected to determine platelet indices, lipid profiles, and blood glucose levels. The SPSS version 21 statistical software was used to perform receiver operating curve (ROC), one-way ANOVA, and independent T-test analysis. The p-value for statistical significance was set at &lt;0.05. Result In the present study, we found a significant difference in the mean value of PLT, MPV, and PDW between DM+MetS, DM, and HC. A statistically significant difference in the mean value of MPV and PDW was observed between HC and DM+MetS as well as DM and DM+MetS (p-value&lt;0.001). At the cutoff value of 9.65fl with a sensitivity of 81.3% and a specificity of 67.9%, MPV differentiates DM+MetS from HC with an AUC of 0.859. MPV can differentiate DM+MetS from DM at a cutoff value of 10.05fl with sensitivity, specificity, and an AUC of 67.9%, 65.2%, and 0.675, respectively. At the cutoff value of 9.65fl with a sensitivity of 69.6% and a specificity of 67.9%, MPV differentiates DM from HC with an AUC of 0.747. The best platelet parameter identified in this study for predicting the presence of DM+MetS comorbidity was MPV (AUC=0.859; 95%CI=0.81-0.90). Conclusion In this study, a significant difference in the mean value of PLT, MPV, and PDW was found between DM+MetS, DM, and HC. The mean value of platelet indices showed significant increases in DM+MetS patients in comparison to HC and DM. MPV has been identified as a good potential marker to predict DM+MetS comorbidity and to differentiate DM+MetS comorbidity from the HC or DM. Our results show that MPV could be a good hematological marker to differentiate DM+MetS comorbidity from the HC or DM, and may offer supportive information for early diagnosis, prevention, and control. Thus, the findings of this study should be taken into account for the prevention and control of DM+MetS comorbidity."

Respondents from a large online sample (N = 1783) were randomly assigned to recall recent instances when they had performed moral, self-indulgent, or routine acts. Those who recalled self-indulgent behaviors or acts associated with care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity-based morality increased in positive emotions relative to routine acts controls. Initial evidence suggests that effects for recalling moral acts occurred in part because individuals who recalled these behaviors generated positive moral self-appraisals and satisfied a basic psychological need for relatedness.

We enrolled infants born with low birth weight between six weeks and six months whose mothers were available and willing to provide informed consent. Upon obtaining informed consent, we administered a structured questionnaire and performed a physical examination on the participants. Blood was drawn for calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D estimation. We measured serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) using the electrochemiluminescence method. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were defined as (25(OH)D) &lt; 20ng/ml and from 20ng/ml to &lt;30 ng/ml respectively. To determine factors associated with vitamin D deficiency, we fit multivariable logistic regression models with exposure factors determined a priori. Data were analysed using Stata version 14.We enrolled 297 participants, 49.2% (167/297) of whom were males. The median infant age was nine weeks (interquartile range 7-13). All infants had less than one hour of sunlight exposure and over 90.6% (269/297) had received multivitamin supplements containing vitamin D. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 12.1% (36/297): 95% CI (8.9%-16.4%). The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was 19.9% (59/297): 95% CI (15.7%-24.8%). Boys had higher odds of vitamin D deficiency compared to girls [adjusted odds ratio 2.8: 95% CI 1.3-6.1].Vitamin D deficiency was 12.1% among low-birth-weight infants in Uganda although almost all of them had received multivitamin supplements containing vitamin D. We recommend that more studies are done in low-birth-weight infants to assess the risk factors for vitamin D in these population in Uganda."

https://openalex.org/W4308914448,"Global and spatially explicit information about the interaction between habitat and wildlife species is critical to enhancing conservation efforts. Despite the recognized importance of mangrove forests to non-human primates, the relationship between the two lacks understanding. To counter this, we created the MangPrim-21 database to map and measure the locations of interactions between all non-human primates and all mangrove forests globally. We report our findings across the global, national, and local scales for all inventoried non-human primates and all inventoried mangrove forests. Globally, we find that half of all non-primates potentially use mangrove forests, and more than half of the global mangrove forest falls within the delineated range of at least one non-human primate species. Nationally, we find that Indonesia, Madagascar, Brazil, Cameroon, and Malaysia likely have the most non-human primate and mangrove forest interactions. At the subnational level, we find that several discrete locations in Kalimantan are critical to both mangrove forests and non-human primates. The MangPrim-21 database provides a globally consistent and locally applicable database of non-human primate and mangrove forest interactions. The results presented have broader implications for non-human primate and mangrove conservation and global actions to protect both. Additionally, our results raise questions about the idea that non-human primates primarily use mangrove forests as a refuge from human encroachment and habitat degradation."

Consequently, there is a lack of knowledge about stability and change in alcohol consumption over the life course and the social, psychological, lifestyle, and health characteristics associated with different alcohol consumption trajectories. Objectives The aims of the study were to describe the prevalence of different adult-life alcohol consumption trajectories among Danish men and to analyze social, psychological, lifestyle and health characteristics associated with these trajectories. Methods For 2510 Danish men, retrospective decade-based information on alcohol consumption during life period 26–60 years was obtained in late midlife and information on individual characteristics was obtained in young adulthood, late midlife and from national hospital registries. The men were allocated to one of six a priori defined alcohol consumption trajectories. Results About 65% of Danish men had a stable moderate consumption, drinking 1–21 units weekly while the five other consumption trajectories were comparatively rare: 3% stable abstainers, 4.7% stable high-risk drinkers, 10.9% with increasing and 12.7% with decreasing consumption. Moderate consumption over the adult life-course was associated with the most favorable social, psychological, lifestyle and health characteristics while the other trajectories were generally associated with less favorable characteristics to varying degrees–e. g. this was the case for the stable abstaining trajectory and in particular the trajectory with decreasing consumption. Conclusion The findings suggest that the majority of Danish men drink moderately in the life period from young adulthood to late midlife, and deviance from this ‘normal’ moderate consumption trajectory is associated with less favorable social, psychological, lifestyle and health characteristics. Some of these characteristics may influence alcohol consumption patterns, but for some of the trajectories, alcohol consumption may influence health as well as social and psychological functioning."
https://openalex.org/W4308915735,"Clinicians raise at least one question for every two patients they see, but search for an answer to less than half of these questions, and rarely use evidence-based resources. One barrier to evidence-based practice is doubt that the search would yield an answer, and we found insufficient evidence to refute this concern. This study aims to identify what proportion of clinical questions in primary care can be answered with online evidence-based practice resources, and what proportion of these can be answered with pre-appraised evidence.Cross-sectional study in two primary care practices. The inclusion criteria were family doctors, generalists and residents working in 2 selected practices. We collected a total of 238 questions from 19 family medicine specialists, 9 family medicine residents and 3 generalist doctors. Doctors were asked to record any clinical question that arose during 4 days of appointments. The primary outcome was the proportion of clinical questions answered with online evidence-based practice resources. The secondary outcome was the level of evidence needed to reach to find the answers (clinical summaries, systematic guidelines, systematic reviews or primary studies), according to Haynes' pre-appraised evidence pyramid model.191 of the 206 valid clinical questions could be answered with online evidence-based practice resources (92.7% [95% CI 88.3%-95.9%]). Most of these questions (90.8% CI 95% 85.9%-94.4%) were successfully answered using clinical summaries (BMJ Best Practice, DynaMed or UpToDate), with a median search time of 4 minutes (range 1-16.5).Contrary to clinician's beliefs, the majority of clinical questions can be answered with online evidence-based practice resources, and most of them with pre-appraised evidence. This study could encourage family doctors to increase the use of clinical summaries. Furthermore, these results highlight the importance of teaching how to search for and apply pre-appraised evidence."
https://openalex.org/W4308924266,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses significant challenges for treatment given the lack of targeted therapies and increased probability of relapse. It is pertinent to identify vulnerabilities in TNBC and develop newer treatments. Our prior research demonstrated that transcription factor EB (TFEB) is necessary for TNBC survival by regulating DNA repair, apoptosis signaling, and the cell cycle. However, specific mechanisms by which TFEB targets DNA repair and cell cycle pathways are unclear, and whether these effects dictate TNBC survival is yet to be determined. Here, we show that TFEB knockdown decreased the expression of genes and proteins involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. DNA replication was decreased in cells lacking TFEB, as measured by EdU incorporation. TFEB silencing in MDA-MB-231 and noncancerous MCF10A cells impaired progression through the S-phase following G1/S synchronization; however, this proliferation defect could not be rescued by co-knockdown of suppressor RB1. Instead, TFEB knockdown reduced origin licensing in G1 and early S-phase MDA-MB-231 cells. TFEB silencing was associated with replication stress in MCF10A but not in TNBC cells. Lastly, we identified that TFEB knockdown renders TNBC cells more sensitive to inhibitors of Aurora Kinase A, a protein facilitating mitosis. Thus, inhibition of TFEB impairs cell cycle progress by decreasing origin licensing, leading to delayed entry into the S-phase, while rendering TNBC cells sensitive to Aurora kinase A inhibitors and decreasing cell viability. In contrast, TFEB silencing in noncancerous cells is associated with replication stress and leads to G1/S arrest."
