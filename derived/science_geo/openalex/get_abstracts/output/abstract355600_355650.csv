https://openalex.org/W2164282552,"An estimated one-third of the world population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These nonreplicating, dormant bacilli are tolerant to conventional anti-tuberculosis drugs, such as isoniazid. We recently identified diarylquinoline R207910 (also called TMC207) as an inhibitor of ATP synthase with a remarkable activity against replicating mycobacteria. In the present study, we show that R207910 kills dormant bacilli as effectively as aerobically grown bacilli with the same target specificity. Despite a transcriptional down-regulation of the ATP synthase operon and significantly lower cellular ATP levels, we show that dormant mycobacteria do possess residual ATP synthase enzymatic activity. This activity is blocked by nanomolar concentrations of R207910, thereby further reducing ATP levels and causing a pronounced bactericidal effect. We conclude that this residual ATP synthase activity is indispensable for the survival of dormant mycobacteria, making it a promising drug target to tackle dormant infections. The unique dual bactericidal activity of diarylquinolines on dormant as well as replicating bacterial subpopulations distinguishes them entirely from the current anti-tuberculosis drugs and underlines the potential of R207910 to shorten tuberculosis treatment.

The global epidemic of tuberculosis (TB) is fuelled by co-infection of HIV patients with TB and a rise in multidrug-resistant TB strains (2Corbett E.L. Watt C.J. Walker N. Maher D. Williams B.G. Raviglione M.C. Dye C. Arch. Int. Med. 2003; 163: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that TB control programs have been in place for decades, approximately one-third of the world population is latently infected with M. tuberculosis. Reactivation of latent TB is a high risk factor for disease development, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, such as HIV-infected patients. For global control of the TB epidemic, there is an urgent medical need for new drugs active against dormant or latent bacilli. These so-called sterilizing drugs would be able to shorten the current 6-month treatment duration for drug-susceptible TB and also offer new treatment opportunities for latent TB. human immunodeficiency virus diarylquinoline tuberculosis minimum inhibitory concentration minimum bactericidal concentration Wayne cidal concentration colony-forming unit N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide. human immunodeficiency virus diarylquinoline tuberculosis minimum inhibitory concentration minimum bactericidal concentration Wayne cidal concentration colony-forming unit N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide. Tubercle bacilli enter lungs of healthy individuals by inhalation, where they are phagocytosed by the alveolar macrophages that eliminate most of the invading mycobacteria (3Koul A. Herget T. Klebl B. Ullrich A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, a small proportion of bacilli survive and exist in a nonreplicating, hypometabolic state, and these bacilli are tolerant to killing by bactericidal anti-TB drugs, such as isoniazid (4Gomez J.E. McKinney J.D. Tuberculosis. 2004; 84: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). They can linger in these altered physiological environments for an individual's lifetime and maintain the capability of causing active TB after reactivation. The pathophysiological conditions in human lesions, thought to lead to persistence, are reduced oxygen tension, nutrient limitation, and acidic pH (5Flynn J.L. Chan J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4195-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 6Wayne L.G. Eur. J. Clin Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1994; 13: 908-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a new chemical class, diarylquinolines (DARQs) that demonstrate potent anti-mycobacterial activity on replicating bacilli both in vitro and in vivo (7Andries K. Verhasselt P. Guillemont J. Gohlmann H.W. Neefs J.M. Winkler H. Van Gestel J. Timmerman P. Zhu M. Lee E. Williams P. de Chaffoy D. Huitric E. Hoffner S. Cambau E. Truffot-Pernot C. Lounis N. Jarlier V. Science. 2005; 307: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar), and the lead compound, R207910 (or TMC207), is currently in Phase IIb clinical trials for the treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant TB. R207910 acts by specifically targeting the membrane-bound c-subunit of F1F0-ATP synthase, the ATP-synthesizing machinery of the cell (8Koul A. Dendouga N. Vergauwen K. Molenberghs B. Vranckx L. Willebrords R. Ristic Z. Lill H. Dorange I. Guillemont J. Bald D. Andries K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). During synthesis of ATP, the energy stored in the electrochemical proton gradient across the membrane is utilized to drive protons from the periplasmic space into the cytoplasm through the F0 subunit and supplying a torque to the F1 unit to convert ADP into ATP (9Junge W. Nelson N. Science. 2005; 308: 642-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Under nonrespiratory conditions, in several bacteria, ATP synthases can function in the reverse direction, hydrolyzing ATP to ADP through ATPase activity and as such pumping protons from the cytoplasm into the periplasmic space (11Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 791-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this way, ATP synthase generates the membrane potential required for the uptake of nutrients. In dormant mycobacteria, a considerable remodeling of the respiratory chain has been reported, including down-regulation of cytochrome aa3 type oxidase and up-regulation of the cytochrome bd type menaquinole oxidase (12Shi L. Sohaskey C.D. Kana B.D. Dawes S. North R.J. Mizrahi V. Gennaro M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15629-15634Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 13Schnappinger D. Ehrt S. Voskuil M.I. Liu Y. Mangan J.A. Monahan I.M. Dolganov G. Efron B. Butcher P.D. Nathan C. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Several studies also suggest that hypometabolic, nonreplicating mycobacteria have decreased requirements for ATP synthase, since the genes encoding the components of the ATP synthase operon are down-regulated, both in vitro and in vivo (12Shi L. Sohaskey C.D. Kana B.D. Dawes S. North R.J. Mizrahi V. Gennaro M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15629-15634Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 13Schnappinger D. Ehrt S. Voskuil M.I. Liu Y. Mangan J.A. Monahan I.M. Dolganov G. Efron B. Butcher P.D. Nathan C. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 14Karakousis P.C.

It is, however, an open question whether ATP synthase plays an essential role in dormant bacilli and whether the enzyme is responsible for ATP synthesis and/or maintenance of the membrane potential. Furthermore, it is not known whether, despite ATP synthase down-regulation, this enzyme can still be utilized as a drug target in dormant bacilli and whether DARQs are still able to effectively kill dormant bacilli. Here we report that, despite a substantial down-regulation of the ATP synthase operon and reduced cellular ATP levels, DARQs effectively kill nonreplicating M. tuberculosis. We find that dormant mycobacteria have active and functional ATP synthase that is capable of synthesizing ATP, a scarce energy resource in a nonreplicating cell. The depletion of ATP in dormant mycobacteria by the R207910-mediated chemical inhibition of ATP synthase leads to potent bactericidal activity. Thus, targeting processes that generate ATP and concurrently disturb the cellular ATP homeostasis is an effective strategy against dormancy. R207910 exhibits no significant effect on the membrane potential in dormant or replicating mycobacteria, suggesting that ATP synthase is not critical for maintaining the membrane potential but is primarily used for the production of ATP. We also demonstrate an increased susceptibility of dormant mycobacteria toward R207910 as compared with actively growing bacteria. Using R207910-resistant mycobacterial strains, we show that the drug specifically targets ATP synthase during dormancy. The unique dual bactericidal action of R207910 on dormant as well as actively replicating bacteria probably contributes to its remarkable sterilizing efficacy in mice, where R207910 as a monotherapy was shown to be as effective as the triple combination of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide (7Andries K. Verhasselt P. Guillemont J. Gohlmann H.W. Neefs J.M. Winkler H. Van Gestel J. Timmerman P. Zhu M. Lee E. Williams P. de Chaffoy D. Huitric E. Hoffner S. Cambau E. Truffot-Pernot C. Lounis N.

This may also explain the ability of this drug to render lungs of infected mice culture-negative faster than first line anti-TB drugs. In conclusion, despite a number of changes in the energy metabolism during dormancy, the ATP production by ATP synthase remains essential for mycobacterial survival. The current study demonstrates the critical importance of ATP synthase in mycobacterial dormancy and suggests that the ATP synthase is an excellent target to treat latent TB infections. Bacterial Strains and Culture Medium—M. tuberculosis H37Rv, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Mycobacterium bovis BCG were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture collection. Mycobacteria were cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) with 0.05% Tween-80 (Sigma) in log phase for a period of 3–4 days before the start of the experiment. The incubation was done in a 250-ml sterile Duran bottle with stirring conditions 37 °C (500 rpm). Chemical Synthesis of DARQ Analogs—DARQ compounds are synthesized as described in a earlier patent (WO2004/011436) and previous reports (7Andries K. Verhasselt P. Guillemont J. Gohlmann H.W. Neefs J.M. Winkler H. Van Gestel J. Timmerman P. Zhu M. Lee E. Williams P. de Chaffoy D. Huitric E. Hoffner S. Cambau E. Truffot-Pernot C. Lounis N. Jarlier V. Science. 2005; 307: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). MIC Microdilution Assays and Determination of Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC90) and Wayne Cidal Concentration (WCC90)—Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, μg/ml) of M. tuberculosis against several DARQ compounds was determined by using 7H9 liquid broth and 7H10 agar dilution as described in earlier studies (16Lenaerts A.J. Gruppo V. Marietta K.S. Johnson C.M. Driscoll D.K. Tompkins N.M. Rose J.D. Reynolds R.C. Orme I.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) with minor modifications using Alamar blue or resazurin for fluorometric measurement (7Andries K. Verhasselt P. Guillemont J. Gohlmann H.W. Neefs J.M. Winkler H. Van Gestel J. Timmerman P. Zhu M. Lee E. Williams P. de Chaffoy D. Huitric E. Hoffner S. Cambau E. Truffot-Pernot C. Lounis N. Jarlier V. Science. 2005; 307: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). MBC90 (μg/ml) was determined as the concentration where 90% of the aerobic grown bacteria were killed after 5 days of treatment by colony-forming unit (CFU) counting using 7H10 agar dilution according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. WCC90 (μg/ml) was determined as the concentration where 90% of the dormant bacteria (grown in the Wayne model) were killed after 5 days of treatment by CFU counting using 7H10 agar dilution. Dormancy Assays—Drastic oxygen depletion (hypoxia model) of mycobacterial cultures was achieved by placing loosely capped tubes containing different drug concentrations inside an anaerobic jar (BBL) along with anaerobic gas generation envelopes (using palladium catalysts), as described previously (17Stover C.K. Warrener P. VanDevanter D.R. Sherman D.R. Arain T.M. Langhorne M.H. Anderson S.W. Towell J.A. Yuan Y. McMurray D.N. Kreiswirth B.N. Barry C.E. Baker W.R. Nature. 2000; 405: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). After 7 days of anaerobiosis, the dormant cultures were harvested by low speed centrifugation, washed twice with 7H9 medium to remove the drugs, and resuspended in drug-free medium. The CFUs of the treated and untreated cultures were determined by plating on 7H10 agar to evaluate the bactericidal activity. In the Wayne model, gradual O2 depletion induces dormancy in mycobacterial cultures, as previously described (18Wayne L.G. Hayes L.G. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2062-2069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after induction of dormancy for 18 days by gradual O2 depletion, cultures without exposure to oxygen were treated further with various drug concentrations for a period ranging from 4 to 21 days, and CFUs were counted on 7H10 plates. In the NO model, dormancy was obtained by incubating cultures with 150 μm of a NO donor (diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide (DETA/NO)) for 2 h, followed by treatment with several compounds for 10 h as previously described (19Voskuil M.I. Schnappinger D. Visconti K.C. Harrell M.I. Dolganov G.M. Sherman D.R. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Real Time Quantitative PCR—Dormant and aerobically grown bacterial pellets were resuspended in Trizol and disrupted with acid-washed glass beads in the Mixer Mill (MM 301). Total RNA was isolated as previously described (20Voskuil M.I. Visconti K.C. Schoolnik G.K. Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2004; 84: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and cleaned up with the RNeasy Protect Bacteria minikit (QIAgen). Reverse transcription was carried out from 0.5 μg of total RNA using random hexamer primers and Superscript II RT as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The sequence of the TaqMan FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) and TAMRA (6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine) probes (Eurogentec) and primers for the mycobacterial genes analyzed in this study are available upon request. Real time quantitative PCR was carried out using the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) as described by the manufacturer. Amplification of endogenous 16 S ribosomal RNA was performed to standardize the amount of cDNA sample added to each reaction. Total Cellular ATP Measurement Assay—ATP levels of log phase aerobic and dormant cultures of M. tuberculosis were measured using the ATP bioluminescence assay kit (Roche Applied Science), as previously described (8Koul A. Dendouga N. Vergauwen K. Molenberghs B. Vranckx L. Willebrords R. Ristic Z. Lill H. Dorange I. Guillemont J. Bald D. Andries K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). ATP levels were followed during dormancy (Wayne model) from day 0 to day 21. Additionally, M. tuberculosis cultivated under Wayne dormancy conditions for 18 days were treated with R207910 (0.006–6 μg/ml), isoniazid (0.3 μg/ml), and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) (100 μg/ml) for 4 days, and ATP levels were measured. Measurement of ATP Synthesis Activity—ATP synthesis of dormant M. smegmatis grown under Wayne conditions for 10 days was measured as described previously (8Koul A. Dendouga N. Vergauwen K. Molenberghs B. Vranckx L. Willebrords R. Ristic Z. Lill H. Dorange I. Guillemont J. Bald D. Andries K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Briefly, inverted membrane vesicles were prepared using a precooled French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. The membrane vesicles were preincubated with R207910 or DCCD under stirring conditions at room temperature for 10 min. The ATP synthesis activity was determined by energizing the membranes with NADH and quantifying the amount of ATP produced using the luciferin/luciferase system (ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit HS II; Roche Applied Science). Data are presented as averages ± S.E. Measurement of the Membrane Potential—Membrane potential was measured using tetra-[3H]phenylphosphonium bromide (Amersham Biosciences) in aerobic and Wayne dormant (10 days) M. smegmatis, as previously described (21Rao M. Streur T.L. Aldwell F.E. Cook G.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were energized with 20 mm glucose, tetra-[3H]phenylphosphonium bromide was added, and cells were centrifuged through silicon oil. Supernatant and cell pellet were dissolved in scintillation fluid and counted with a liquid scintillation analyzer (TRI-CARB 2100TR; Packard). Membrane potential (in mV) was calculated according to the Nernst relationship. Values represent averages ± S.E. of four independent experiments. Comparisons were performed using Student's t test (StatXact). p values of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Bactericidal Activity of R207910 on Dormant M. tuberculosis—The effect of DARQ lead compound, R207910, on the growth of nonreplicating M. tuberculosis was tested in three different in vitro dormancy models. As a control for target specificity during dormant conditions, we tested the efficacy of R207910 on the R207910-resistant strain of M. tuberculosis (BK12), carrying a point mutation in the α-helix of the c-subunit of the ATP synthase complex (7Andries K. Verhasselt P. Guillemont J. Gohlmann H.W. Neefs J.M. Winkler H. Van Gestel J. Timmerman P. Zhu M. Lee E. Williams P. de Chaffoy D. Huitric E. Hoffner S. Cambau E. Truffot-Pernot C. Lounis N. Jarlier V. Science. 2005; 307: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Both wild type and mutant strains were subjected to dormancy using either gradual (Wayne) or drastic (hypoxia) O2 depletion or NO treatment in the presence of 0.1 and 10 μg/ml R207910 (Fig. 1). We treated Wayne dormant M. tuberculosis for 7 days with R207910 to determine its killing efficacy. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, R207910 at 10 μg/ml leads to a 1.8-log10 reduction in CFU counts, whereas no apparent effect was observed at 0.1 μg/ml. The viability of dormant bacilli was not affected by isoniazid treatment, an inhibitor of biosynthesis of cell wall mycolic acids. In contrast, metronidazole at 100 μg/ml led to a 1.9-log10 reduction in CFUs as compared with untreated control. Metronidazole is a prodrug that is effective only under anaerobic conditions. However, it has been shown to be ineffective against latent mycobacteria in a Cornell mouse infection model (22Brooks J.V. Furney S.K. Orme I.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DCCD, a nonspecific ATP synthase inhibitor, showed a drastic killing effect at 100 μg/ml (Fig. 1A). In the hypoxia model, M. tuberculosis cultures were subjected to drastic O2 depletion in an anaerobic chamber. R207910 reduced the mycobacterial viability by 2.1-log10 CFUs at 10 μg/ml but had no apparent effect at 0.1 μg/ml (Fig. 1B). Metronidazole tends to be slightly more potent than in the Wayne model, leading to a 2.5-log10 CFU reduction at 100 μg/ml. This can be explained by the extreme hypoxic conditions created in the anaerobic chamber, and as such, the effects of metronidazole, which works best in a severely O2-depleted environment, tend to be enhanced. NO has been shown to inhibit aerobic respiration in several bacterial systems, and it induces a dormancy response in mycobacteria similar to oxygen depletion (19Voskuil M.I. Schnappinger D. Visconti K.C. Harrell M.I. Dolganov G.M. Sherman D.R. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Treatment of midlog aerobically grown cultures of M. tuberculosis with low nontoxic concentrations (150 μm) of DETA/NO induced typical dormancy regulon gene expression (Fig. 3A). In our study, 2 h after treatment with DETA/NO, mycobacteria were exposed for 10 h to R207910 and control drugs. DETA/NO alone had no effect on mycobacterial survival as compared with untreated control (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, isoniazid (10 μg/ml) had no effect on these dormant bacilli, whereas the viability of the bacilli was drastically reduced by DCCD. However, metronidazole (100 μg/ml), in contrast to the O2 depletion dormancy assays, was not bactericidal, because as a prodrug, it is active only in an O2-limiting and not in an NO environment. R207910 (10 μg/ml) led to a 1-log10 drop in CFU counts, whereas no apparent effect was observed at 0.1 μg/ml. It has been previously shown that NO dissipates in the reaction tubes over a period of time, and by 16 h, the bacteria tend to lose their dormant phenotype (19Voskuil M.I. Schnappinger D. Visconti K.C. Harrell M.I. Dolganov G.M. Sherman D.R. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). However, the effects of R207910 on NO-treated mycobacteria in this model (10 h of treatment) were reached within the dormant physiological phase. Susceptibility Comparison of Dormant and Aerobically Grown Mycobacteria with R207910—The present first line and second line TB antibiotics exhibit strong bactericidal activity on replicating mycobacteria, but none of them show a comparable efficacy on dormant bacilli. In order to evaluate the bactericidal activity of R207910 on dormant versus actively replicating mycobacteria, we determined the bactericidal concentration of R207910 in aerobic (MBC90) and Wayne dormant (WCC90) M. tuberculosis (Table 1). Rifampicin and isoniazid, included as controls, were both more potent in aerobically grown and significantly less for the dormant bacilli. In contrast, R207910 was slightly more active on dormant bacilli (WCC90 of 1 μg/ml), as compared with aerobically grown bacilli (MBC90 of 2 μg/ml). This suggests that dormant bacteria are slightly more prone (about 2-fold) to R207910 bactericidal activity as compared with actively growing mycobacteria (WCC90/MBC90 ratio of 0.5).TABLE 1Comparative killing activity of TB compounds (rifampicin, isoniazid, and R207910) for actively replicating and dormant M. tuberculosisCompoundMBC90WCC90WCC90/MBC90μg/mlμg/mlRifampicin0.030.517Isoniazid0.25>64>256R207910210.5 Open table in a new tab To further evaluate this result, we measured killing kinetics of R207910 and isoniazid on Wayne dormant and aerobically grown bacilli (Fig. 2). For this purpose, both cultures were diluted to equal A600 values or ∼107 to 108 CFU/ml and treated with R207910 (10 μg/ml). For aerobic cultures, we observed an initial 2.2-log10 drop in CFUs by the end of the first week of treatment with R207910 and an additional 0.8-log10 reduction in CFUs by day 14. In contrast, treatment of dormant mycobacteria resulted in an initial 1.8-log10 drop in CFUs by the end of the first week, but by day 14, killing was more pronounced, with an additional 3.0-log10 drop in CFUs versus untreated control. As expected, isoniazid had no effect on dormant bacterial cultures. However, in aerobic cultures, isoniazid killed about 2.2 log10 during the first week, with no additional killing during the second week. R207910-mediated killing of dormant bacilli at a 10 μg/ml concentration was highly potent, since no bacteria could be counted by day 14 (Fig. 2). In contrast, the killing kinetics of R207910 at 1 μg/ml on Wayne dormant M. tuberculosis suggested a characteristic biphasic killing with a 2.9-log10 drop in CFUs by day 14 and no further reduction by day 21 (Fig. S1). In summary, by measuring the bactericidal concentrations as well as killing kinetics, we demonstrated that R207910 kills dormant M. tuberculosis at least as effectively as actively replicating bacilli. This makes R207910 the only TB drug with equal bactericidal activities on different bacterial subpopulations. Specificity of DARQ Activity in Dormant Mycobacteria—Target specificity of DARQs was assessed by introducing chemical changes in the DARQ scaffold. During dormancy, bacteria might have alternative means of energy or ATP production (e.g. substrate level phosphorylation), and as such, ATP synthase might be redundant. Hence, it is postulated that R207910 might affect other cellular targets as well (23Zhang Y. Post-Martens K. Denkin S. Drug Discov. Today. 2006; 11: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). At first, we studied the correlation between various structural and chemical changes in R207910 and its analogs versus their effect on biological activity. This leads to the determination of a structure-activity relationship. Over 400 DARQ derivatives were prepared and tested on actively replicating and aerobically grown M. tuberculosis cultures in in vitro MIC determination assays (data not shown). Five compounds (Fig. S2A) with MICs between 0.09 and 20 μg/ml were selected for evaluating their bactericidal effect on Wayne dormant M. tuberculosis. R207910 at 1 and 10 μg/ml led to 1.3- and 2.1-log10 CFU reduction, respectively, as compared with untreated dormant control cultures (Table 2). As can be seen in Table 2, an analogue with a methyl substituent on the first aryl moiety of R207910 (named 18040971-AAA) retained its bactericidal activity on dormant bacteria with 1.55-log10 killing at 1 μg/ml. However, replacement of the dimethylamino group by azole groups (25756770-AAA) led to a decrease in the activity on both aerobic (MIC 8.19 μg/ml) and dormant bacilli (0.29-log10 CFU reduction). Interestingly, changing the chain length in R207910 between the hydroxyl and the terminal dimethylamino group (18086601-AAA) also decreased activity on both aerobic (MIC 20.21 μg/ml) as well as dormant bacilli (0.11-log10 CFU reduction). These data suggest a strong correlation between structural variations of the DARQ scaffold and the subsequent effect on their activities against replicating and dormant bacilli (Fig. S2B). The sharp overlap between the bactericidal activities of DARQ analogs on dormant and replicating bacilli implies that their effects are highly target-specific, irrespective of mycobacterial growth conditions and physiological states.TABLE 2Bactericidal action of DARQs in killing aerobic and dormant M. tuberculosisCompound IDMIC90 (aerobic cultures)Log10 reduction (dormant cultures)10 μg/ml1 μg/mlμg/mlR2079100.092.11.3518040971-AAA0.162.131.5517996134-AAA1.741.140.8725756770-AAA8.190.980.2918086601-AAA20.210.230.11 Open table in a new tab In a second approach to characterize the target specificity of R207910 during dormancy, we tested the efficacy of R207910 on the resistant strain of M. tuberculosis (BK12) bearing a mutation in c-subunit of ATP synthase (7Andries K.

At the highest concentration of 10 μg/ml, R207910 had no effect on this mutant strain in Wayne (Fig. 1A), hypoxia (Fig. 1B), and NO (Fig. 1C) conditions. Isoniazid had no effect under these conditions, suggesting that bacilli were indeed in a nonreplicating state. The ATP synthase inhibitor DCCD had a drastic killing effect and led to a 5.3-, 2.8-, and 4.3-log10 drop in CFUs in Wayne (Fig. 1A), hypoxia (Fig. 1B), and NO (Fig. 1C), respectively. The la"

While other species of this group are considered prototypes of commensal bacteria, S. pneumoniae is among the most frequent microbial killers worldwide. Population genetic analysis of 118 strains, supported by demonstration of a distinct cell wall carbohydrate structure and competence pheromone sequence signature, shows that S. pneumoniae is one of several hundred evolutionary lineages forming a cluster separate from Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus infantis. The remaining lineages of this distinct cluster are commensals previously collectively referred to as Streptococcus mitis and each represent separate species by traditional taxonomic standard. Virulence genes including the operon for capsule polysaccharide synthesis and genes encoding IgA1 protease, pneumolysin, and autolysin were randomly distributed among S. mitis lineages. Estimates of the evolutionary age of the lineages, the identical location of remnants of virulence genes in the genomes of commensal strains, the pattern of genome reductions, and the proportion of unique genes and their origin support the model that the entire cluster of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, and S. mitis lineages evolved from pneumococcus-like bacteria presumably pathogenic to the common immediate ancestor of hominoids. During their adaptation to a commensal life style, most of the lineages gradually lost the majority of genes determining virulence and became genetically distinct due to sexual isolation in their respective hosts."

However, the molecular mechanism by which phenoloxidase-induced melanin synthesis is regulated in vivo is largely unknown. It is known that the Spätzle-processing enzyme is a key enzyme in the production of cleaved Spätzle from pro-Spätzle in the Drosophila Toll pathway. Here, we provide biochemical evidence that the Tenebrio molitor Spätzle-processing enzyme converts both the 79-kDa Tenebrio prophenoloxidase and Tenebrio clip-domain SPH1 zymogen to an active melanization complex. This complex, consisting of the 76-kDa Tenebrio phenoloxidase and an active form of Tenebrio clip-domain SPH1, efficiently produces melanin on the surface of bacteria, and this activity has a strong bactericidal effect.

Upon injury or infection, proPO in the blood plasma is activated to phenoloxidase (PO) by clip-domain serine proteases, which are called proPO-activating factors (PPAFs) or enzymes (PPAEs), or alternatively proPO-activating proteins (11Lee S.Y.

PO, the active form of proPO, catalyzes the production of quinones, which can nonspecifically cross-link neighboring molecules to form melanin at the injury site or all over the surface of invading microorganisms (17Kumar S. Christophides G.K. Cantera R. Charles B. Han Y.S. Meister S. Dimopoulos G. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Quinones may also be involved in the production of cytotoxic molecules such as superoxides and hydroxyl radicals, which could help to kill the invading microorganisms (6Gillespie J.P. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 19Nappi A.J. Ottaviani E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). PO-induced melanin synthesis is thought to be essential for defense and development, but it must be tightly controlled because systemic hyperactivation of the proPO system, excessive production of quinones, and excessive melanin synthesis are harmful to the host. This implies that proPO activation and melanin synthesis are tightly regulated by melanization regulatory molecules (6Gillespie J.P. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 7Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). However, the molecular regulatory mechanism of melanin synthesis is unclear. Recently, we reported that a soluble fragment of Lys-type PG, a long glycan chain with short stem peptides, is a potent activator of the Drosophila Toll pathway and the Tenebrio proPO activation cascade (20Park J.-W. Kim C.-H. Kim J.H. Je B.R. Roh K.-B. Kim S.J. Lee H.H. Ryu J.H. Lim J.H. Oh B.H. Lee W.J. Ha N.-C. Lee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6602-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The fact that the same elicitor activates both the proPO system and the Toll pathway and that the clustering of T. molitor (Tm) PG recognition protein-SA (PGRP-SA) molecules on the PG is followed by activation of the proPO cascade suggests that there are obvious possibilities for molecular cross-talk between these two innate immune responses. Consistent with this possibility, we showed that partial lysozyme digestion of highly cross-linked Lys-type PG dramatically increases the binding of Tm-PGRP-SA, presumably by inducing clustering of Tm-PGRP-SA, which then recruits Tm-GNBP1 and Tm-modular serine protease (MSP) (20Park J.-W. Kim C.-H. Kim J.H. Je B.R. Roh K.-B. Kim S.J. Lee H.H. Ryu J.H. Lim J.H. Oh B.H. Lee W.J. Ha N.-C. Lee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In that study, we suggested that formation of the Lys-type PG ·Tm-PGRP-SA ·Tm-GNBP1 complex leads to the activation of downstream PPAEs or PPAFs. However, we did not investigate the detailed molecular cross-talk between the proPO and Toll cascades. We and other groups have reported the biochemical properties of clip-domain serine protease and clip-domain serine protease homologues (SPHs) that function as PPAEs or PPAFs (21Lee K.Y. Zhang R.

All these serine proteases are known to consist of a trypsin-like domain at the C terminus and one or two clip domains at the N terminus, but all SPHs lack proteolytic activity due to substitution of the catalytic Ser residue with a Gly residue (16Piao S.

Two of these PPAFs have been crystallized, and these structural studies have provided details about the activation mechanism (15Piao S. Kim S. Kim J.H. Park J.-W. Lee B.L. Ha N.-C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4404-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For example, they showed that proPO cleavage alone is insufficient to produce active PO. In fact, an activated SPH (reported to be PPAF-II) is needed to lead to enzymatically active PO. Furthermore, the structural studies showed that when an active PPAF cleaves an SPH, the activated SPH oligomerizes, and the clip domain of SPH acts as a module for binding PO (16Piao S. Song Y.L.

This probably serves to ensure that the active PO is under tight control and does not spread through the hemolymph in an uncontrolled manner but rather remains in the vicinity of the original trigger of the activation cascade. These findings provided some of the clues about how the proPO cascade and melanin synthesis are tightly regulated, but they did not provide detailed insights. To provide compelling biochemical evidence for the regulatory control of melanin synthesis and to search for possibilities of molecular cross-talk between the Toll pathway and proPO activation, we purified Tm-proPO, Tm-Spätzle-processing enzyme (SPE), and two different SPH zymogens (Tm-SPH1 and Tm-SPH2) to homogeneity. By performing in vitro reconstitution experiments with these purified proteins, we provide clear biochemical evidence that the active form of Tm-SPE and a specific Tm-SPH1 tightly regulate the activation of proPO and melanin synthesis in the Tm-proPO system. Insect and Antibodies—T. molitor larvae (mealworm) were maintained on a laboratory bench in terraria containing wheat bran. Hemolymph was collected as described previously (27Zhang R. Cho H.Y.

Briefly, to harvest the hemolymph, a larva was pricked using a 25-gauge needle, and then a 10-μl drop of hemolymph was collected in 50 μl of modified anticoagulation buffer (136 mm trisodium citrate, 26 mm citric acid, 20 mm EDTA, and 15 mm sodium chloride, pH 5.0). The collected crude hemolymph was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then stored at –80 °C until used.

In brief, a mixture of the active form of Tm-SPE (150 ng), Tm-proPO (3 μg), and Tm-SPH1 zymogen (1 μg) in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2 was preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min, after which 150 μl of the substrate solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dopamine and 10 mm CaCl2) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The increase in absorbance at 400 nm, which occurred in parallel with the synthesis of melanin, was measured using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer. Purification of Tm-proPO, Active Tm-SPE, and Tm-SPH2 Zymogen—Detailed procedures used to purify Tm-proPO, active and zymogenic forms of Tm-SPE, and Tm-SPH2 from the hemolymph (insect blood) of T. molitor larvae are described under the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” In Vitro Reconstitution Experiments and Peptide Sequencing—To determine the cleavage sites of Tm-proPO and Tm-SPH1 induced by active Tm-SPE, in vitro reconstitution experiments were performed as described previously (5Kim C.-H.

To map proteolytic cleavage sites, the reaction mixtures following enzyme treatment were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with a solution containing 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and 50% methanol. The membrane was destained with 50% methanol containing 10% (v/v) acetic acid until the protein bands became visible. The zymogen cleavage products were identified by their N-terminal sequences using a gas-phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Melanin-coated bacterial cells were fixed in ice-cold 100% methanol. After washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, bacteria were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Tween 20 (blocking buffer) containing 3% skim milk for 1 h. After washing, cells were sequentially incubated with mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody (H-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-Tm-proPO polyclonal antibody (1:100 in blocking buffer) for 2 h. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200 in blocking buffer; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then added and incubated for 1 h. After washing twice with blocking buffer, stained cells were observed under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Tm-SPH1—A DNA fragment encoding Tm-SPH1 (21Lee K.Y. Zhang R. Kim M.S. Park J.-W. Park H.Y. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Eur. J.

These sites were later used to add a C-terminal tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site and a hexahistidine tag. The PCR products were subcloned into the pFast-Bac-SEa vector. The resulting plasmid was transformed into DH10Bac cells, and the transformation mixture was spread on LB agar culture medium containing isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), gentamicin, kanamycin, and tetracycline. The white colonies were selected and cultured for amplification, and the bacmid DNA was extracted. After bacmid verification, Sf9 cells were transfected with the bacmid DNAs, and the resulting viruses were harvested and amplified as recommended by Invitrogen (Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system manual). For protein expression, Sf9 cells in 1 liter of suspension culture were infected with recombinant baculovirus. For purification of the expressed protein, the medium was first concentrated to ∼100 ml by ultrafiltration through a membrane filter and then dialyzed at 4 °C against 10 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove precipitates, the supernatant was mixed with 3 ml of precharged nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen Inc.) and gently rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Unbound proteins were allowed to pass through the resin, which was then washed with 200 ml of the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with 200 mm imidazole in the same buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. For His tag removal, the fractions containing expressed proteins were incubated with tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen). His-tagged removed recombinant Tm-SPH1 was purified using a size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography column (TSK G3000SW) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The fractions containing expressed proteins were pooled and concentrated on Centricon YM-10 to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the recombinant Tm-SPH1 protein was carried out to verify the identities of the purified proteins. Inhibition Experiments Using Tm-proPO—The reaction mixture containing Tm-proPO (3 μg), Tm-SPH1 zymogen (1 μg), and the active form of Tm-SPE (150 ng) in 50 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2) was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min, and the reaction mixtures were cooled on ice for 5 min and divided into three equal portions. One portion was mixed with 200 μl of substrate solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dopamine and 10 mm CaCl2) at 30°C for 15 min, and the melanin synthesis activity was estimated. Benzamidine was added to the second portion to a final concentration of 5 mm; the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h; and the melanin synthesis activity was examined. Benzamidine to a final concentration of 5 mm and 30 μg of Tm-proPO were simultaneously added to the third portion; the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h; and the melanin synthesis activity was estimated as described above. Assay of Antibacterial Activity—Antibacterial activity was assayed essentially as described previously (30Moon H.J. Lee S.Y. Kurata S. Natori S. Lee B.L. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bactericidal activity of melanin-concentrated bacteria was assayed using Staphylococcus aureus (strain Cowan 1) and Escherichia coli (strain K12). Bacteria grown in antibiotic medium were collected during the exponential phase of growth and suspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. The bacterial cells (106) were incubated with a mixture of active Tm-SPE (150 ng), Tm-proPO (3 μg), and Tm-SPH1 (1 μg) in the presence of 1 mm l-dopamine in 200 μl of assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm CaCl2) for 40 min at 30 °C. Melanin-coated bacteria were diluted 500-fold with assay buffer, and aliquots of 50 μl were spread on Bactoagar (Difco). The plates were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C, and colony numbers on test and control plates were compared. Active Tm-SPE Induces Melanin Synthesis in Vivo—Recently, we reported that the active form of Tm-SPE cleaves the 24-kDa Spätzle proprotein between Arg124 and Phe125 residues (5Kim C.-H. Kim S.J.

Cleaved 14-kDa Spätzle, a ligand of the Toll receptor, induces strong antimicrobial activity when injected into Tenebrio larvae (5Kim C.-H. Kim S.J. Kan H. Kwon H.-M. Roh K.-B. Jiang R. Yang Y. Park J.-W. Lee H.H. Ha N.-C. Kang H.J. Nonaka M. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7599-7607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed previously that an unidentified serine protease specifically cleaved 79-kDa Tm-proPO between Arg50 and Phe51, and the resulting molecule of cleaved Tm-76-kDa PO was concentrated in the residues of the melanized cell clump/adhesion region (28Lee H.S. Cho M.Y. Lee K.M. Kwon T.H. Homma K. Natori S. Lee B.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that active Tm-SPE can cleave Tm-proPO between Arg50 and Phe51 and thereby induce melanin synthesis in vivo, we injected the active form of Tm-SPE into Tenebrio larvae. The active form of Tm-SPE induced high levels of melanin synthesis after 4 days (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that the active form of Tm-SPE may convert Tm-proPO to Tm-PO, and the activated Tm-PO then induces melanin synthesis in vivo. To confirm that active Tm-SPE cleaves Tm-proPO between Arg50 and Phe51 and then induces melanin synthesis in vitro, we incubated purified Tm-proPO (Fig. 1B, lane 2) with purified active Tm-SPE (lane 1) and subjected the reaction samples to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (lanes 3 and 4). Surprisingly, active Tm-SPE generated three new bands (bands a–c). N-terminal sequencing of these three newly generated bands (Fig. 1C) revealed sequences identical to those deduced for Tm-proPO zymogen (28Lee H.S. Cho M.Y. Lee K.M. Kwon T.H. Homma K. Natori S. Lee B.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This result suggests that 79-kDa Tm-proPO was cleaved by active Tm-SPE at two different sites: one at Arg51 and another at Arg281 (Fig. 1D). To examine whether the cleaved products of Tm-proPO induce melanin synthesis in the presence of active Tm-SPE, the mixture was incubated with l-dopamine. This mixture did not induce any melanin production (Fig. 1E, bar 2); given that we observed melanin synthesis in vivo, this result indicates that some other molecule(s) may be required to induce melanin synthesis in vitro. Because an SPH is required to form an active PO complex in Holotrichia (16Piao S. Song Y.L. Kim J.H. Park S.Y. Park J.-W. Lee B.L. Oh B.H. Ha N.-C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4404-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we selected Tenebrio SPHs. We reported previously that Tenebrio SPHs, such as 56-kDa Tm-SPH1 (referred to as Tm-mas (21Lee K.Y. Zhang R. Kim M.S. Park J.-W. Park H.Y. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4375-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)) and 52-kDa Tm-SPH2 (referred to as Tm-45 (22Kwon T.H. Kim M.S. Choi H.W. Joo C.H. Cho M.Y. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6188-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)), are necessary for showing PO activity in the insect T. molitor. However, the biological functions of these SPHs during proPO activation were not determined. When we co-incubated Tm-proPO, active Tm-SPE, and purified Tm-SPH1 zymogen, the mixture induced strong melanin synthesis (Fig. 1E, bar 3). However, if the reaction mixture contained Tm-SPH2 instead of Tm-SPH1, no melanin synthesis was induced (bar 4). These results suggest that a specific SPH is required for proper activation of Tenebrio proPO because SPH1 but not SPH2 triggers melanin synthesis. Tm-SPE Proteolytically Cleaves Tm-SPH1—To compare the roles of Tm-SPH1 and Tm-SPH2 in melanin synthesis, we first analyzed the cleavage patterns of Tm-SPHs after incubation with active Tm-SPE in vitro (Fig. 2A). Active Tm-SPE rapidly cleaved Tm-SPH1 zymogen between Arg96 and Ile97, generating the 43-kDa active form of Tm-SPH1 (Fig. 2A, lane 2, band d). Under the same conditions, however, Tm-SPH2 was not cleaved (lane 4). This result supports the idea that active Tm-SPE specifically cleaves Tm-SPH1 but not Tm-SPH2. To examine whether Tm-SPH1 is involved in melanin synthesis, we compared SDS-PAGE patterns when active Tm-SPE and Tm-proPO were mixed in the presence or absence of Tm-SPH1 zymogen (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, only a 76-kDa band was generated in the presence of Tm-SPH1; performing SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions led to the appearance of an additional high molecular mass band (band e) at the top of the gel (Fig. 2B, lane 1). However, this band was not generated in the presence of Tm-SPH2 (lane 2). These results suggest that the active form of Tm-SPE completely converts 79-kDa Tm-proPO to 76-kDa Tm-PO by cleaving at the first site (Arg50), but not at the second one (Arg281). This cleavage subsequently led to production of the chemically cross-linked high molecular mass band (band e). To explore what kind of proteins are engaged in this high molecular mass band (band e), we performed Western blot analysis using anti-Tm-proPO, anti-Tm-SPE, and anti-Tm-SPH1 antibodies (Fig. 2C). Band e was recognized by antibodies against both Tm-proPO and Tm-SPH1 (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 6), but not by an antibody against Tm-SPE (lane 9). This result supports the idea that band e is a covalently cross-linked protein complex consisting of active Tm-PO and active Tm-SPH1. Chemically Cross-linked Adducts Are Generated by the Melanization Complex—To conduct further tests of whether covalently cross-linked high molecular mass complexes consist of active Tm-PO and active Tm-SPH1, we tried to isolate this complex by size exclusion column chromatography. First, as a control, the mixture of Tm-proPO and active Tm-SPE was loaded onto a size exclusion column, and each fraction of peak 1 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). As shown previously in Fig. 2A, the mixture of Tm-proPO cleavage products co-eluted in peak 1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–4). However, when we loaded the mixture of Tm-proPO, active Tm-SPE, and Tm-SPH1 zymogen onto the same column, the proteins eluted as two peaks (Fig. 3C). When we examined the melanin synthesis activities of the two peaks, peak 2 was quite active in synthesizing melanin, but peak 3 was not under the same conditions (Fig. 3D). This result suggests that peak 2 contains protein components capable of melanin synthesis. To identify the protein components involved in melanin synthesis, we performed SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting on fractions from peak 2. The high molecular mass band (band e) and the 76-kDa PO band (band a) were observed mainly in peak 2 by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3E, lane 1), and both bands were strongly recognized by antibodies against"

https://openalex.org/W2034968517,"Background Entering puberty is an important milestone in reproductive life and secular changes in the timing of puberty may be an important indicator of the general reproductive health in a population. Too early puberty is associated with several psychosocial and health problems. The aim of our study was to determine if the age at onset of pubertal growth spurt (OGS) and at peak height velocity (PHV) during puberty show secular trends during four decades in a large cohort of school children. Methods and Findings Annual measurements of height were available in all children born from 1930 to 1969 who attended primary school in the Copenhagen Municipality. 135,223 girls and 21,612 boys fulfilled the criteria for determining age at OGS and age at PHV. These physiological events were used as markers of pubertal development in our computerized method in order to evaluate any secular trends in pubertal maturation during the study period (year of birth 1930 to 1969). In this period, age at OGS declined statistically significantly by 0.2 and 0.4 years in girls and boys, respectively, whereas age at PHV declined statistically significantly by 0.5 and 0.3 years in girls and boys, respectively. The decline was non-linear with a levelling off in the children born between 1940 and 1955. The duration of puberty, as defined by the difference between age at OGS and age at PHV, increased slightly in boys, whereas it decreased in girls. Conclusion Our finding of declining age at OGS and at PHV indicates a secular trend towards earlier sexual maturation of Danish children born between 1930 and 1969. Only minor changes were observed in duration of puberty assessed by the difference in ages at OGS and PHV."
https://openalex.org/W2001776200,"Adenosine is an immunosuppressive nucleoside, and adenosine A(2A) receptors inhibit T-cell activation. We investigated the role of A(2A) receptors in regulating T helper (Th)1- and Th2-cell development and effector function. A(2A)-receptor stimulation suppressed the development of T-cell receptor (TCR) -stimulated naive T cells into both Th1 and Th2 cells, as indicated by decreased IFN-gamma production by cells developed under Th1-skewing conditions and decreased interleukin (IL) -4, IL-5, and IL-10 production by cells developed under Th2-skewing conditions. Using A(2A) receptor-deficient mice, we demonstrate that A(2A) receptor activation inhibits Th1- and Th2-cell development by decreasing the proliferation and IL-2 production of naive T cells, irrespective of whether the cells are expanded under Th1- or Th2-skewing environment. Using in vivo established Th1 and Th2 cells, we further demonstrate the nonselective nature of A(2A) receptor-mediated immunosuppressive effects, because A(2A) receptor activation decreased IFN-gamma and IL-4 secretion and mRNA level of TCR-stimulated effector Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. A(2A) receptor mRNA expression in both Th1 and Th2 effector cells increased following TCR stimulation. In summary, these data demonstrate that A(2A) receptor activation has strong inhibitory actions during early developmental, as well as late effector, stages of Th1- and Th2-cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2082311140,"Peptide toxins with high affinity, divergent pharmacological functions, and isoform-specific selectivity are powerful tools for investigating the structure-function relationships of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). Although a number of interesting inhibitors have been reported from tarantula venoms, little is known about the mechanism for their interaction with VGSCs. We show that huwentoxin-IV (HWTX-IV), a 35-residue peptide from tarantula Ornithoctonus huwena venom, preferentially inhibits neuronal VGSC subtypes rNav1.2, rNav1.3, and hNav1.7 compared with muscle subtypes rNav1.4 and hNav1.5. Of the five VGSCs examined, hNav1.7 was most sensitive to HWTX-IV (IC(50) approximately 26 nM). Following application of 1 microm HWTX-IV, hNav1.7 currents could only be elicited with extreme depolarizations (>+100 mV). Recovery of hNav1.7 channels from HWTX-IV inhibition could be induced by extreme depolarizations or moderate depolarizations lasting several minutes. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis indicated that the toxin docked at neurotoxin receptor site 4 located at the extracellular S3-S4 linker of domain II. Mutations E818Q and D816N in hNav1.7 decreased toxin affinity for hNav1.7 by approximately 300-fold, whereas the reverse mutations in rNav1.4 (N655D/Q657E) and the corresponding mutations in hNav1.5 (R812D/S814E) greatly increased the sensitivity of the muscle VGSCs to HWTX-IV. Our data identify a novel mechanism for sodium channel inhibition by tarantula toxins involving binding to neurotoxin receptor site 4. In contrast to scorpion beta-toxins that trap the IIS4 voltage sensor in an outward configuration, we propose that HWTX-IV traps the voltage sensor of domain II in the inward, closed configuration."
https://openalex.org/W2010641085,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) acts as a hierarchically high switch of the angiogenic cascade by interacting with its high affinity VEGF receptors and with neuropilin co-receptors. VEGF(165) binds to both Neuropilin-1 (NP-1) and VEGFR-2, and it is believed that ligand binding forms an extracellular bridge between both molecules. This leads to complex formation, thereby enhancing VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and subsequent signaling. We found that inhibition of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) phosphorylation reduced complex formation between NP-1 and VEGFR-2, suggesting a functional role of the cytoplasmic domain of VEGFR-2 for complex formation. Correspondingly, deleting the PDZ-binding domain of NP-1 decreased complex formation, indicating that extracellular VEGF(165) binding is not sufficient for VEGFR-2-NP-1 interaction. Synectin is an NP-1 PDZ-binding domain-interacting molecule. Experiments in Synectin-deficient endothelial cells revealed reduced VEGFR-2-NP-1 complex formation, suggesting a role for Synectin in VEGFR-2-NP-1 signaling. Taken together, the experiments have identified a novel mechanism of NP-1 interaction with VEGFR-2, which involves the cytoplasmic domain of NP-1."
https://openalex.org/W2061798427,"Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) controls lineage commitment, proliferation, and anabolic functions of osteoblasts as the subnuclear effector of multiple signaling axes (e.g. transforming growth factor-beta/BMP-SMAD, SRC/YES-YAP, and GROUCHO/TLE). Runx2 levels oscillate during the osteoblast cell cycle with maximal levels in G(1). Here we examined what functions and target genes of Runx2 control osteoblast growth. Forced expression of wild type Runx2 suppresses growth of Runx2(-/-) osteoprogenitors. Point mutants defective for binding to WW domain or SMAD proteins or the nuclear matrix retain this growth regulatory ability. Hence, key signaling pathways are dispensable for growth control by Runx2. However, mutants defective for DNA binding or C-terminal gene repression/activation functions do not block proliferation. Target gene analysis by Affymetrix expression profiling shows that the C terminus of Runx2 regulates genes involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling (e.g. Rgs2, Rgs4, Rgs5, Rgs16, Gpr23, Gpr30, Gpr54, Gpr64, and Gna13). We further examined the function of two genes linked to cAMP signaling as follows: Gpr30 that is stimulated and Rgs2 that is down-regulated by Runx2. RNA interference of Gpr30 and forced expression of Rgs2 in each case inhibit osteoblast proliferation. Notwithstanding its growth-suppressive potential, our results surprisingly indicate that Runx2 may sensitize cAMP-related G protein-coupled receptor signaling by activating Gpr30 and repressing Rgs2 gene expression in osteoblasts to increase responsiveness to mitogenic signals."
https://openalex.org/W1971854397,"Vitamin D3 causes potent suppression of various cancer cells; however, significant supraphysiological concentrations of this compound are required for antineoplastic effects. Current combinatorial therapies with vitamin D3 are restricted to differentiation effects. It remains uncertain if autophagy is involved in vitamin D3 inhibition on leukemia cells. Here we show that besides triggering differentiation and inhibiting apoptosis, which was previously known, vitamin D3 triggers autophagic death in human myeloid leukemia cells. Inhibiting differentiation does not efficiently diminish vitamin D3 suppression on leukemia cells. Vitamin D3 up-regulates Beclin1, which binds to class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to trigger autophagy. Vitamin D3 phosphorylates Bad in its BH3 domain, resulting in disassociation of the apoptotic Bad-Bcl-xL complex and association of Bcl-xL with Beclin1 and ultimate suppression of apoptotic signaling. Knockdown of Beclin1 eliminates vitamin D3-induced autophagy and inhibits differentiation but activates apoptosis, suggesting that Beclin1 is required for both autophagy and differentiation, and autophagy cooperates with differentiation but excludes apoptosis, in which Beclin1 acts as an interface for these three different cascades. Moreover, additional up-regulation of autophagy, but not apoptosis, dramatically improves vitamin D3 inhibition on leukemia cells. These findings extend our understanding of the action of vitamin D3 in antineoplastic effects and the role of Beclin1 in regulating multiple cellular cascades and suggest a potentially promising strategy with a significantly better antileukemia effect.

The antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is overexpressed in many tumors, was down-regulated by vitamin D3 or its analogues in prostate cancer cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and retinoblastoma cells undergoing apoptosis (12Guzey M.

In invasive breast cancer cells, down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein is accompanied by an increase in the proapoptotic protein Bax and a release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria followed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (15Flanagan L. Pacman K. Juba B. O'Neill S. Tenniswood M. Welsh J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 84: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Contrary to the observation that vitamin D3 induces apoptosis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (16Pepper C. Thomas A. Hoy T. Milligan D. Bentley P. Fegan C. Blood. 2003; 101: 2454-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), two studies show that vitamin D3 inhibits apoptosis of myeloid leukemia cells (17Iguchi T. Miyazawa K. Asada M. Gotohm A.

Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting cell type-dependent mechanisms by which vitamin D3 modulates apoptosis.Autophagy is a ubiquitous process believed to occur in all eukaryotic cells in which cytosol and organelles are sequestered within double-membrane vesicles that deliver their contents to lysosomes for degradation and/or recycling of the resulting macromolecules (19Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Autophagy is frequently reduced in cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts and acts as a protective mechanism in response to nutrients depletion. However, stimulation of autophagy in cancer cells was observed in response to anticancer treatments when enhanced autophagy destroys large proportions of the cytosol and organelles, which causes irreversible cellular atrophy with a consequent collapse of vital cellular functions (20Bursch W. Hochegger K. Torok L. Marian B. Ellinger A. Hermann R.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Inbal B. Bialik S. Sabanay I. Shani G. Kimchi A. J.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Therefore, autophagy can protect cells against death or mediate cellular demise, depending on autophagy stimuli and cellular context. A vitamin D3 analog, EB1089, initially reported to induce apoptosis via a p53-independent mechanism involving p38 MAPK activation and ERK MAPK inactivation in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (16Pepper C. Thomas A. Hoy T. Milligan D. Bentley P. Fegan C. Blood. 2003; 101: 2454-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), triggered autophagy in breast cancer cells (23Hoyer-Hansen M. Bastholm L. Mathiasen S. Elling F. Jaattela M. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), again suggesting that the mechanisms on anticancer effects by the same compound may vary depending on cell types.Although vitamin D3 shows promise in counteracting tumors, significant supraphysiological concentration of this compound is required for antineoplastic effects. Such concentrations are not achievable in patients due to predictable hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria resulting from the increased intestinal absorption of calcium and the calcium-mobilizing properties of vitamin D3. To reduce the risk of vitamin D3-induced hypercalcemia and the possible immunosuppressive effects of its analogs, a combination of low doses of vitamin D3 or its analogs with administration of another agent that enhances differentiation but does not enhance the levels of circulating calcium and is not immunosuppressive, has been pursued. For example, vitamin D3 with docetaxel, dexamethasone, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and carnosic acid were tried in several types of cancers and cancer model cell lines (24Beer T.M. Eilers K.M. Garzotto M. Egorin J. Lowe B.A. Henner W.D. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 28: 8-15Google Scholar, 25Beer T.M. Ryan C.W. Venner P.M. J. Clin.

However, the current combinatorial therapies with vitamin D3 in the preclinical stage are restricted to differentiation effects, thus limiting the efficacy on cancer cell suppression. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which vitamin D3 exerts suppressive effects on tumor model cells is needed to develop vitamin D3 analogs and vitamin D3 combinatorial therapies targeting critical signaling pathways with a better antineoplastic effect.In this study we show that vitamin D3 triggers autophagic death by up-regulating Beclin1 along with triggering differentiation but inhibiting apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells. Knockdown of Beclin1 not only cripples vitamin D3-induced autophagy but also inhibits vitamin D3-induced differentiation and activates apoptotic signaling. These data suggest that autophagy cooperates with differentiation but excludes apoptosis, in which Beclin1 acts as an interface for these three different cascades. We further demonstrate that additional up-regulation of autophagy dramatically improves the antineoplastic effect of vitamin D3 on human myeloid leukemia cells, suggesting a better strategy for combating leukemia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Materials and specific vendors were as follows: antibodies specific to C/EBPβ, Rb, Raf1, caspase 9, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Bad, phospho-Bad, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), or phospho-mTOR (Cell Signaling); antibodies specific to Beclin1, class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3), or LC3 (Abgent); vitamin D3, Cay10443 (Cayman Chemical); rapamycin, bafilomycin A1 (Calbiochem); human Beclin1 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), human PI3KC3 siRNA (Novus Biologicals); human Raf1 siRNA and human mTOR siRNA (Cell Signaling); DNA construct green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 (Addgene); pepstatin A (Sigma); ABT-737 (Abbott Laboratories) (27Oltersdorf T.

Vitamin D3 was treated at 5 nm when cells were recultured or when transfection was performed.Co-immunoprecipitation—50 μg of antibody against each bait protein was immobilized in a coupling gel, and each 50 μg of cell lysates prepared from different treatments was incubated with the antibody-immobilized coupling gel using ProFound-Co-Immunoprecipitation kits (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol.RNA Interference—HL-60 cells were transfected with desalted, purified, and annealed double-stranded siRNA (5 μg/1 × 106 cells) as designated in the experiments using the Amaxa nucleofection system (kit V, program G-17).Differentiation and Growth Arrest Assay—For the differentiation assay, expression of the cell surface differentiation marker CD14 was measured by flow cytometric immunofluorescence using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated CD14 antibody (Abcam). The fluorescence intensity represents the relative expression level of the marker in response to vitamin D3. Functional differentiation was measured by a NBT reduction assay as previously described (28Wang J. Yen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4375-4386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For cell growth arrest assay, the distribution of cells in the cell cycle was measured by flow cytometric analysis of hypotonic propidium iodide-stained nuclei to derive the percentage of cells with G1/0 DNA content as previously described (28Wang J. Yen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4375-4386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Apoptosis Assay—Apoptosis was determined by caspase expression and cleavage, pan-caspase activity assay, and the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Caspase expression and cleavage was detected by Western blotting. Pan-caspase activity was determined by caspase activation detection kits that use a carboxyfluorescein-labeled fluoromethyl ketone peptide inhibitor of caspase producing green fluorescence (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Apoptotic cells were determined by a TUNEL assay (29Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9119) Google Scholar) with the DeadEnd fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were grown on slides, fixed in 4% methanol-free formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. DNA strand breaks were then labeled with fluorescein-12-dUTP by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme, and the nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The number of apoptotic cells with green fluorescence (fluorescein-12-dUTP)/100 blue 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclei were calculated by fluorescence microscopy.Autophagy Assay—Autophagy was determined by 1) detection of specific autophagic markers, including detection of the formation of kinase complex Beclin1-PI3KC3 essential for autophagy by co-immunoprecipitation (30Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar, 31Kihara T. Yabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), 2) detection of autophagic flux, the specific processing of autophagy protein LC3 with or without a lysosomal protease inhibitor by Western analysis (32Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. EMBO J. 2002; 19: 5720-5728Crossref Scopus (5361) Google Scholar, 33Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar), and 3) detection of autophagosomes with GFP-LC3 marker by confocal fluorescence microscopy (32Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. EMBO J. 2002; 19: 5720-5728Crossref Scopus (5361) Google Scholar). For the confocal fluorescence microscopic detection, HL-60 cells were transfected with GFP-LC3 construct or cotransfected with siRNA targeting the designated genes, and the transfected cells treated with or without vitamin D3 were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and covered with Mowiol in 50% glycerol, PBS (v/v) and observed under a Leica confocal microscope.Statistics—Results are represented as the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments. Two group comparisons were performed using Student's t test. Multiple group comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance and Fisher's least significant difference.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONInhibition of Differentiation Does Not Efficiently Diminish Vitamin D3 Suppression on HL-60 Leukemia Cells—In addition to its induction of differentiation, shown by the induced expression of the cell surface differentiation marker CD14 determined by flow cytometric immunofluorescence and functional differentiation determined by NBT reduction assay (Fig. 1A), vitamin D3 also caused leukemia cell death at the late stage of the treatment (Fig. 1B). Previous studies found that Raf1 activation causes differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells in response to vitamin D3 (11Wang J. Zhao Y. Kauss M.A. Spindel S. Lian H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2008; (in press)Google Scholar, 34Wang X. Studzinski G.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or retinoic acid (28Wang J. Yen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4375-4386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) up-regulation is one of the downstream events of the differentiation cascade caused by activation of Raf1/MEK/ERK MAPK signaling in response to vitamin D3 (11Wang J. Zhao Y. Kauss M.A. Spindel S. Lian H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2008; (in press)Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is a transcription factor for monocytic differentiation, and its binding to Rb is required in monocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells in response to vitamin D3 (35Yan J. Studzinski G.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To examine if differentiation is the only mechanism by which vitamin D3 suppresses human myeloid leukemia cells, we depleted Raf1 by RNA interference in HL-60 cells. As expected, knockdown of the Raf1 crippled vitamin D3-induced Rb up-regulation and abolished C/EBPβ binding to Rb (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the vitamin D3-induced differentiation signaling was inhibited by knockdown of Raf1. Furthermore, knockdown of Raf1 effectively inhibited vitamin D3-induced expression of the differentiation marker CD14 and crippled functional differentiation (Fig. 1D), confirming successful blockage of the differentiation in response to vitamin D3. Surprisingly, although knockdown of Raf1 significantly crippled the antiproliferation by vitamin D3 due to crippled differentiation, inhibition of leukemia cell growth was not efficiently reversed, and cell viability was not improved when differentiation machinery driven by vitamin D3 was completely inhibited (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that other mechanisms may be implicated in suppressing myeloid leukemia cells under vitamin D3 induction.Vitamin D3 Inhibits Apoptosis of HL-60 Cells—Vitamin D3 was reported to cause caspase-dependent apoptosis in several tumor cells (12Guzey M. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar, 13James S. Mackay A.G. Colston K.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Biol. 2003; 84: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The vitamin D3 analog, EB1089, was also reported to induce apoptosis in leukemia cells (16Pepper C. Thomas A. Hoy T. Milligan D. Bentley P. Fegan C. Blood. 2003; 101: 2454-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but other reports reveal that vitamin D3 causes an inhibitory effect on apoptosis of leukemia cells (17Iguchi T. Miyazawa K. Asada M. Gotohm A. Mizutani S. Ohyashiki K. Int. J. Oncol. 2005; 27: 893-900PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Zhang J. Studzinski G.P. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These opposing results suggest a necessity of verifying the effects of vitamin D3 on apoptosis before we could suggest any other mechanism responsible for cell death in response to vitamin D3 in HL-60 cells.To test if caspase-dependent apoptosis is attributed to the myeloid leukemia cell suppression and cell death in response to vitamin D3, we first measured the pan-caspase activity of the HL-60 cells treated with or without vitamin D3. Flow cytometric measurements show that at 96 h of treatment, control cells showed high caspase activity possibly resulting from a high cell density and metabolic stress due to a long culture time, whereas vitamin D3-treated cells showed significantly reduced pancaspase activities (Fig. 2A). The cytometric data were supported by the Western blotting result of caspase 9, a key member of proteases implicated in apoptosis. Caspase 9 was expressed and cleaved in the absence of vitamin D3 at a late stage of culturing when high cell density and metabolic stress triggered an apoptotic response. Treatment of the cells with vitamin D3 inhibited the expression of caspase 9 (Fig. 2B), further suggesting that vitamin D3 inhibits apoptotic signaling in myeloid leukemia cells.FIGURE 2Vitamin D3 inhibits apoptosis of leukemia cells. A, vitamin D3 inhibits caspase activity. HL-60 cells treated with or without vitamin D3 for the designated times were measured for pan-caspase activity with a caspase activation kit by flow cytometry. B, Western blotting of caspase 9 at different time points of vitamin D3 treatment. C, vitamin D3 inhibits apoptotic death determined by the TUNEL assay at the designated time points.

E, vitamin D3 phosphorylates Bad (p-Bad) determined by Western analysis at the designated time points. β-Actin is the loading control for the Western results probed from the same blot in panels B, D, and E. F, vitamin D3 disassociates Bcl-xL from Bad determined by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) of Bcl-xL or Bad at the designated time points. The Western or coimmunoprecipitation results are representative of three independent repeats for each experiment.

Lademann U. Jäättelä M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar) and human B lymphocytes (37Drénou B. Blancheteau V. Burgess D.B. Fauchet R. Charron D.J. Mooney N.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4115-4124PubMed Google Scholar). In support of the observation that vitamin D3 inhibits apoptotic signaling in myeloid leukemia cells, HL-60 cells treated with or without vitamin D3 were examined with a TUNEL assay, which detects apoptotic death from DNA breaks. The results show that control cells at 72 and 96 h, the late stage of culturing, reached a high TUNEL-positive percentage presumably resulting from metabolic stress due to the long culture time, whereas vitamin D3 treatment reduced the TUNEL-positive percentage (Fig. 2C), confirming that vitamin D3 inhibits apoptotic death in human myeloid leukemia cells. In addition, vitamin D3 induced the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase did not express until 72 h after vitamin D3 induction (Fig. 2D). These data further support the role of vitamin D3 in inhibiting apoptotic signaling in myeloid leukemia cells, which was initially observed by other groups (17Iguchi T. Miyazawa K. Asada M. Gotohm A. Mizutani S. Ohyashiki K. Int. J. Oncol. 2005; 27: 893-900PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Zhang J. Studzinski G.P. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because vitamin D3 also induces apoptosis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (16Pepper C. Thomas A. Hoy T. Milligan D. Bentley P. Fegan C. Blood. 2003; 101: 2454-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the regulation on apoptosis by vitamin D3 appears to be cell type-dependent.However, the mechanism by which vitamin D3 negatively regulates apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells has not been fully understood. Bad is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that promotes cell death and is a member of the family of “BH3 domain only” proteins that transduces death signals from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial membrane and induces apoptosis (38Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Bad binding to Bcl-xL by the BH3 domain causes Bcl-xL to release Apaf1 or regulate other Bcl-xL activities resulting in a caspase 9-initiated cascade of proteolysis and induction of apoptosis (39Martin S.J. Green D.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Vitamin D3 caused phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-155 in HL-60 cells (Fig. 2E). Because the Ser-155 is located within the BH3 domain of Bad that mediates its apoptotic activities via heterodimerization to the Bcl-xL at the mitochondrial membrane (38Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar, 39Martin S.J. Green D.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23687-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-155 by vitamin D3 directly inhibits BH3 function and interaction with Bcl-xL, thus blocking the binding of Bad to Bcl-xL. These results are confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation detection at 96 h of vitamin D3 treatment (Fig. 2F) and are consistent with a previous report on the inactivation of Bad and suppression of apoptotic cascades (42Tan Y. Demeter M.R. Ruan H. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25865-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The above data suggest a mechanism by which vitamin D3 phosphorylates Bad Ser-155 to disassociate Bcl-xL from Bad, thus inhibiting caspase activation to prevent apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells.Vitamin D3 Induces Autophagy of HL-60 Cells—Our above data show that inhibition of vitamin D3-induced differentiation did not efficiently diminish vitamin D3 suppression on HL-60 cells and that vitamin D3 inhibited apoptosis. Thus, we asked if autophagy is involved in the mechanisms of vitamin D3 action on the suppression of the leukemia cells. The kinase mTOR is the major mediator of the cell survival pathway and also the principal negative regulator of autophagy (43Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 44Guertin D.A. Sabatini D.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Western blotting results show that vitamin D3 down-regulated mTOR. Down-regulation of mTOR coincided with decreased phospho-p70S6 kinase, the downstream effector of mTOR (Fig. 3A), suggesting that vitamin D3 may induce autophagy.FIGURE 3Vitamin D3 induces Beclin1 and PI3KC3-dependent autophagy in leu"
https://openalex.org/W2001534952,"With the Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) a new method for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infections (LTBI) is available. Due to the lack of a gold standard for the diagnosis of LTBI, the IGRA is compared to the Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), which yields discordant results in varying numbers. Therefore we assessed to which extent discordant results can be explained by potential risk factors such as age, BCG vaccination and migration.In this pooled analysis, two German studies evaluating the Quantiferon-Gold In-Tube test (QFT) by comparison with the TST (RT23 of SSI) were combined and logistic regressions for potential risk factors for TST+/QFT- as well as THT-/QFT+ discordance were calculated. The analysis comprises 1,033 participants. Discordant results were observed in 15.4%, most of them being TST+/QFT- combinations. BCG vaccination or migration explained 85.1% of all TST+/QFT- discordance. Age explained 49.1% of all TST-/QFT+ discordance. Agreement between the two tests was 95.6% in German-born persons younger than 40 years and not BCG-vaccinated.After adjustment for potential risk factors for positive or negative TST results, agreement of QFT and TST is excellent with little potential that the TST is more likely to detect old infections than the QFT. In surveillance programs for LTBI in high-income, low TB incidence countries like Germany the QFT is especially suited for persons with BCG vaccination or migrants due to better specificity and in older persons due to its superior sensitivity."

Although the roles of Hdac1 and Hdac2, class I HDACs, in cardiac hyperplasia, growth, and hypertrophic responsiveness have been reported, the role in the heart of Hdac3, another class I HDAC, has been less well explored. Here we report that myocyte-specific overexpression of Hdac3 in mice results in cardiac abnormalities at birth. Hdac3 overexpression produces thickening of ventricular myocardium, especially the interventricular septum, and reduction of both ventricular cavities in newborn hearts. Our data suggest that increased thickness of myocardium in Hdac3-transgenic (Hdac3-Tg) mice is due to increased cardiomyocyte hyperplasia without hypertrophy. Hdac3 overexpression inhibits several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, including Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b, Cdkn1c, Cdkn2b, and Cdkn2c. Hdac3-Tg mice did not develop cardiac hypertrophy at 3 months of age, unlike previously reported Hdac2-Tg mice. Further, Hdac3 overexpression did not augment isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy when compared with wild-type littermates. These findings identify Hdac3 as a novel regulator of cardiac myocyte proliferation during cardiac development.

Science. 1996; 272: 371-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Modifications of core histones, around which DNA is packaged, play prominent roles in the regulation of gene expression (2Thiagalingam S. Cheng K.H. Lee H.J. Mineva N. Thiagalingam A. Ponte J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 983: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). For instance, core histones are acetylated by histone acetyl transferases, leading to unwinding and relaxation of the chromatin structure and subsequent gene activation. This enzymatic acetylation step is reversed by HDAC-dependent deacetylation, leading to chromatin condensation and gene repression (3Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E.

Hdac3, which is structurally related to Hdac1 and Hdac2, is a component of the NCoR-SMRT co-repressor complex, which is distinct from co-repressor complexes that typically contain Hdac1 and Hdac2 (21Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W. Verdin E. Lazar M.A. Shiekhattar R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1048-1057PubMed Google Scholar). A series of recent reports, including those from our group, have demonstrated striking anti-hypertrophic effects of broad spectrum chemical HDAC inhibitors, but the molecular targets of these agents in the heart remain unclear (8Antos C.L.

Whether Hdac3 participates in mediating the effects of HDAC inhibitors in the heart or plays an independent role in cardiac development, growth, and hypertrophic response is presently unknown. Therefore to further elucidate the role of Hdac3 in cardiac growth, development, and hypertrophic responses, we generated myocyte-specific Hdac3-Tg mice. Two independent Hdac3-Tg mice lines revealed increased cardiac myocyte proliferation and down-regulation of CKIs. Unlike Hdac2-Tg mice, these mice did not show spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy or increased sensitivity to hypertrophic stimuli. Our data suggest a novel and distinct role of Hdac3 in myocyte proliferation and cardiac growth distinct from Hdac1 and Hdac2. Hdac3-Transgenic Mice—A cDNA encoding murine FLAG-tagged Hdac3 was cloned into an expression plasmid containing the Myh6 (encoding α-myosin heavy chain) promoter, and transgenic mice were generated by standard techniques. Genotyping was performed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA, and cardiac-specific expression of Hdac3 was revealed by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis using antibodies to Hdac3 and FLAG (Sigma). Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from dissected mouse hearts using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and the SuperScript first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Gene expression was then evaluated by qRT-PCR (ABI PRISM 7900) using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems). Signals were normalized to corresponding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase controls, and the ratios were expressed as -fold changes when compared with wild-type controls. PCR conditions and primer set sequences are available upon request. Western Blotting—We used antibodies to Hdac3 (1:1000 dilution, Sigma), α-tubulin (1:5000 dilution, Sigma), and acetylhistone H4 (1:200 dilution, Upstate Biotechnology). Primary antibody binding was visualized by using the Westernbreeze Kit (Invitrogen) as described earlier and according to the manufacturer's instructions (12Trivedi C.M. Luo Y. Yin Z. Zhang M. Zhu W. Wang T. Floss T. Goettlicher M. Noppinger P.R. Wurst W. Ferrari V.A. Abrams C.S. Gruber P.J. Epstein J.A. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). HDAC Activity Assay—HDAC activity was measured as described previously (22Trivedi C.M. Patel R.C. Patel C.V. Atherosclerosis. 2007; 195: e50-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, total extract was prepared from hearts of post-natal day 1 (P1) wild-type and Hdac3-Tg mice (two independent lines). 50 μg of total extract was incubated with HDAC assay substrate and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. After the addition of diluted activator reagent, samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and readings were taken by fluorescent microplate reader at an excitation of 360 nm and emission of 450 nm. A standard curve was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Protocols for hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry have been described (12Trivedi C.M. Luo Y. Yin Z. Zhang M. Zhu W. Wang T. Floss T. Goettlicher M. Noppinger P.R. Wurst W. Ferrari V.A. Abrams C.S. Gruber P.J. Epstein J.A. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). P1 wild-type and Hdac3-Tg heart sections were immunostained with anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody (1:2000, Cell Signaling), Ki67 antibody (1:50), and MF-20 (1:25, HybridomaBank). Using ImageJ software, phospho-histone H3-positive myocyte nuclei and the total number of nuclei were counted in eight different sections of three independent heart samples. The average of phospho-histone H3-positive nuclei was divided by the total number of nuclei to determine percentages of phospho-histone H3-positive myocytes. Similarly, Ki67-positive nuclei in MF-20-expressing myocytes were counted. The average of MF-20-positive nuclei was divided by the total number of nuclei in MF-20-expressing cells to determine the percentages of Ki67-positive myocytes. Assessment of Cardiomyocyte Size—TRITC-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma) staining (100 μg/ml) was performed on sections of neonatal (P1) and 3-month-old hearts from wild-type and Hdac3-Tg mice to determine the cell boundaries. ImageJ software was used to determine the cross-sectional area of the cardiac myocytes. Approximately 500 cardiac myocytes were counted from P1 and 2-month-old hearts. Isoproterenol Treatment—Isoproterenol (ISO, Sigma, I5627) was delivered to 12-week-old mice by implanting a micro-osmotic pump (Alzet, Durect; model 1002) subcutaneously under isoflurane anesthesia. ISO (30 mg/kg/d) or vehicle (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, Invitrogen) was infused subcutaneously for 14 days. Mice were sacrificed after 14 days, and heart-to-body-weight ratios and heart-weight-to-tibial-length ratios were determined. Statistics—All measurement data are expressed as mean ± S.D. The statistical significance of differences between groups was analyzed by Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at a p value <0.05. Cardiac Myocyte-specific Hdac3-Tg Mice—To understand the role of Hdac3 in cardiac development and the regulation of hypertrophy, we used the Myh6 (encoding α-myosin heavy chain) promoter to overexpress Hdac3 in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1A). We confirmed overexpression at the mRNA level in two independent Hdac3-Tg lines by real-time PCR. Our data show 15–20-fold induction of Hdac3 mRNA in P1 hearts of Hdac3-Tg mice when compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 1B). We also confirmed overexpression of Hdac3 in P1 hearts by Western blotting in both independent Hdac3-Tg lines (Fig. 1C). In both lines, densitometry analysis by ImageJ software determined that Hdac3 protein was overexpressed ∼4–8-fold (Fig. 1D). To determine the functionality of Hdac3 overexpression, we performed HDAC activity assays on P1 heart lysates. As shown in Fig. 1E, both lines of Hdac3-Tg mice demonstrate 2-fold increases in HDAC activity. Furthermore, levels of acetyl-histone H4 in P1 Hdac3-Tg hearts were reduced by almost 40% (Fig. 1F), consistent with a moderate increase in HDAC activity. Further, we determined whether Hdac3 overexpression alters class I HDACs, Hdac1 and Hdac2, expression in neonatal myocardium. Our data show that Hdac3 overexpression has no effect on Hdac1 and Hdac2 protein levels (Fig. 1G). Hdac3 Overexpression Causes Myocyte Hyperplasia during Development—To determine the role of Hdac3 overexpression in cardiac development, we examined wild-type and Hdac3-Tg hearts at birth (P1). Histological analysis demonstrated near or complete loss of right and left ventricular lumens in Hdac3-Tg mice when compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 2A). We also observed thickened ventricular walls and interventricular septa in serial sections of the P1 Hdac3-Tg hearts (Fig. 2A). Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed increased nucleation of cardiac myocytes (Fig. 2A). We performed phospho-histone H3 staining to assess proliferation and to help to distinguish between cardiac myocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy as the cause of increased wall thickness. Hdac3-Tg hearts showed a 2–3-fold increase in phospho-histone H3 staining throughout the myocardium when compared with wild-type hearts at P1 (p < 0.008, Fig. 2C). Similarly, Ki67 staining was also increased 2-fold in Hdac3-Tg hearts when compared with wild type (wild type 30.9% ± 2.9%, n = 3, Hdac3-Tg 54.8% ± 3.6%, n = 7, Fig. 2D). Increased proliferation was not observed in other tissue examined, including lung and skeletal muscle (data not shown). We performed Ki67 and MF-20 co-immunostaining on wild-type and Hdac3-Tg P1 heart sections to determine whether proliferating cells are myocytes. Our data suggest that ∼90% of the proliferating cells are cardiac myocytes (Fig. 2D). Wheat germ agglutinin staining to assess cardiac myocyte size revealed no significant difference in cardiac myocytes in Hdac3-Tg mice at P1 age when compared with wild-type littermates (wild type, 11.9 ± 1.2 μm2, Hdac3-Tg P1 myocytes, 12.0 ± 1.7 μm2, Fig. 2D). Interestingly, by 2 months of age, cardiac myocytes of Hdac3-Tg mice appeared relatively normal in size, and no increase in proliferative index was evident (Fig. 2, B and D). Histological analysis with trichrome stains revealed no evidence of excessive cardiac fibrosis in Hdac3-Tg mice at birth or at 2 months of age (data not shown). Hdac3 Overexpression Inhibits Cyclin-dependent Kinase Inhibitor Expression—Loss of Hdac3 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation in human colon cancer cells via up-regulation of Cdkn1a (p21WAF/CIP1) (23Wilson A.J. Byun D.S. Popova N. Murray L.B. L'Italien K. Sowa Y. Arango D. Velcich A. Augenlicht L.H. Mariadason J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13548-13558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Conversely, Hdac3 overexpression has been shown to repress Cdkn1a and Cdkn2b transcription in human embryonic kidney cells (24Huang W. Tan D. Wang X. Han S. Tan J. Zhao Y. Lu J. Huang B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism by which Hdac3 overexpression induces cardiac myocyte proliferation, we examined expression of CKIs in Hdac3-Tg P1 hearts. RT-PCR analysis indicates that Hdac3 suppresses expression of Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b (p27Kip1), Cdkn1c (p57Kip2), Cdkn2c (p18INC4c), and Cdkn2b (p15INC4b) at the transcriptional level (Fig. 3A). Hdac3 overexpression had no effect on expression of Cdkn2a (p16INC4a) in P1 hearts (Fig. 3A). These data suggest specificity of Hdac3 in the regulation of CKIs. At 2 months of age, no changes in CKI expression levels were detected (Fig. 3B). Hypertrophic Response to Adrenergic Stimulus in Hdac3-Tg Mice—Previously, our laboratory has demonstrated that myocyte-specific overexpression of another class I HDAC, Hdac2, induces cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis by 2 months of age (12Trivedi C.M. Luo Y. Yin Z. Zhang M. Zhu W. Wang T. Floss T. Goettlicher M. Noppinger P.R. Wurst W. Ferrari V.A. Abrams C.S. Gruber P.J. Epstein J.A. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). To determine whether Hdac3 overexpression is sufficient to regulate cardiac hypertrophy, we determined heart-to-body-weight ratios and heart-weight-to-tibia-length ratios in 3-month-old Hdac3-Tg mice (n = 18) and when compared with wild-type (n = 14) littermates. No significant differences in heart-weight-to-body or heart-to-tibia-length measurements were present (Fig. 4, A and B). Further, we examined whether Hdac3 overexpression augments hypertrophic responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation. Wild-type and Hdac3-Tg littermates at 3 months of age were treated with a constant infusion of saline or ISO for 2 weeks. As predicted, wild-type mice exhibited marked cardiac hypertrophy, as revealed by an increase in the heart-to body-weight (and heart-to-tibia-length) ratios (Fig. 4, A and B). Hypertrophy of Hdac3-Tg mice in response to ISO was similar to wild type, and there was no apparent augmentation of hypertrophic response when compared with wild type (Fig. 4, A and B). Hdac3 Regulates Cardiac Hyperplasia—Cardiac myocytes rapidly proliferate during embryonic and fetal life but generally lose their ability to proliferate shortly after birth (25Bicknell K.A. Coxon C.H. Brooks G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2007; 42: 706-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The withdrawal of postnatal cardiomyocytes from the cell cycle is linked to significant down-regulation of cyclins, CDKs, and E2F transcription factors and to up-regulation of the negative regulators of cell cycle progression including Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b, Cdkn1c, and Cdkn2c (26Ahuja P. Sdek P. MacLellan W.R. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 521-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Loss or down-regulation of these CKIs causes increased proliferation of neonatal myocytes. For example, mice lacking Cdkn1b show a 2–3-fold increase in myocyte proliferation and prolonged cell cycle (27Poolman R.A. Li J.M. Durand B. Brooks G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). FOXO1-dependent activation of Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b, and Cdkn1c expression results in decreased myocyte proliferation (28Evans-Anderson H.J. Alfieri C.M. Yutzey K.E. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although the roles of CKIs in the regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation are well documented, their transcriptional regulation during cardiac development is not well defined. Our data suggest a novel regulator of CKI transcription in neonatal cardiac myocytes. We show that Hdac3 overexpression in cardiac myocytes suppresses Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b, Cdkn1c, Cdkn2b, and Cdkn2c mRNA expression neonatal P1 hearts. It will be interesting in future studies to determine whether Hdac3 directly or indirectly regulates the transcription of these genes. Hdac3 overexpression produced increased cardiac myocyte proliferation at birth, but this effect was no longer evident by 2 months of age, although Hdac3-Tg protein was still detectable. Thus, mechanisms must exist within the myocyte to overcome the pro-proliferative effects of Hdac3 and to produce cell cycle exit. Similar phenomena have been described previously. For example, loss of Hopx or Hdac2 leads to increase in fetal cardiac myocyte proliferation, but these abnormalities abate in adulthood (12Trivedi C.M. Luo Y. Yin Z. Zhang M. Zhu W. Wang T. Floss T. Goettlicher M. Noppinger P.R. Wurst W. Ferrari V.A. Abrams C.S. Gruber P.J. Epstein J.A. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 29Chen F. Kook H. Milewski R. Gitler A.D. Lu M.M. Li J. Nazarian R. Schnepp R. Jen K. Biben C. Runke G. Mackay J.P. Novotny J. Schwartz R.J. Harvey R.P. Mullins M.C. Epstein J.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Similarly, Cdkn1b knock-out mice show increased fetal cardiac myocyte proliferation but eventually withdraw from the cell cycle (27Poolman R.A. Li J.M. Durand B. Brooks G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Normalization of cardiac size and myocyte cell number in adult transgenic mice despite early postnatal hyperplasia must be accomplished by an increase in cell loss via apoptosis or other mechanisms. Previous studies have demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors, which target class I and II HDACs, induce growth arrest, maturation, and apoptosis of several tumors and cancer cell lines, implicating the specific roles of individual HDACs in the maintenance of cell proliferation and survival (30Xu W.S. Parmigiani R.B. Marks P.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5541-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Among class I and II HDACs, previous studies have demonstrated a role for class I HDACs, Hdac1 and Hdac2 in the regulation of cell proliferation. For example, global loss of Hdac1 results in embryonic lethality before embryonic day 10.5 due to severe proliferation defects and retardation in development (17Lagger G. O'Carroll D. Rembold M. Khier H. Tischler J. Weitzer G. Schuettengruber B. Hauser C. Brunmeir R. Jenuwein T. Seiser C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Interestingly, loss of Hdac1 up-regulates Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b, which may explain the proliferation defects (17Lagger G. O'Carroll D. Rembold M. Khier H. Tischler J. Weitzer G. Schuettengruber B. Hauser C. Brunmeir R. Jenuwein T. Seiser C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Loss of Hdac2 in mice results in severe cardiac defects at birth including increased cardiac myocyte proliferation and thickening of the myocardium, although the exact mechanism is not known (12Trivedi C.M. Luo Y. Yin Z. Zhang M. Zhu W. Wang T. Floss T. Goettlicher M. Noppinger P.R. Wurst W. Ferrari V.A. Abrams C.S. Gruber P.J. Epstein J.A. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 18Montgomery R.L. Davis C.A. Potthoff M.J. Haberland M. Fielitz J. Qi X. Hill J.A. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1790-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that global loss of Hdac3 leads to embryonic lethality before embryonic day 9.5 due to decrease in S phase cells and proliferation defects (31Bhaskara S. Chyla B.J. Amann J.M. Knutson S.K. Cortez D. Sun Z.W. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, our data support a role for Hdac3 as a regulator of cardiac myocyte proliferation. Previous studies have suggested a role of Hdac3 in cancer cell proliferation and mitosis. Hdac3 overexpression may inhibit Cdkn1a expression at the transcriptional level by interacting with Sp1, at least in some tumor cell lines (24Huang W. Tan D. Wang X. Han S. Tan J. Zhao Y. Lu J. Huang B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additionally, liver-specific loss of Hdac3 results in 12-fold up-regulation of Cdkn1a at the transcriptional level (32Knutson S.K. Chyla B.J. Amann J.M. Bhaskara S. Huppert S.S. Hiebert S.W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, our data suggest that overexpression of Hdac3 inhibits Cdkn1a transcription in cardiac myocytes. Further, we show that Hdac3 overexpression inhibits other CKIs including Cdkn1b, Cdkn1c, Cdkn2b, and Cdkn2c. Roles of Class I and II HDACs in Hypertrophic Responsiveness—Most adult cardiac myocytes are unable to proliferate but can undergo hypertrophy in response to appropriate stimulation (26Ahuja P. Sdek P. MacLellan W.R. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 521-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The role of the HDACs in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy is complex. Previous studies have demonstrated that class I and II HDACs have opposing roles in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy (14Backs J. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). For example, inactivation of class II HDACs produces mice with grossly enlarged hearts, suggesting that class II HDACs repress cardiac hypertrophy (15Chang S. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8467-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that global loss of the class I HDAC, Hdac2, results in mice that are resistant to hypertrophic stress (12Trivedi C.M. Luo Y. Yin Z. Zhang M. Zhu W. Wang T. Floss T. Goettlicher M. Noppinger P.R. Wurst W. Ferrari V.A. Abrams C.S. Gruber P.J. Epstein J.A. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cardiac myocyte-specific overexpression of Hdac2 induces significant cardiac hypertrophy in 2-month-old mice (12Trivedi C.M. Luo Y. Yin Z. Zhang M. Zhu W. Wang T. Floss T. Goettlicher M. Noppinger P.R. Wurst W. Ferrari V.A. Abrams C.S. Gruber P.J. Epstein J.A. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Together these data suggest that class I HDACs might normally function in the heart to repress anti-hypertrophic pathways. Although class I HDACs are structurally related, they contribute to different transcriptional repression complexes (33Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). For example, mSin3A, NuRD, and CoREST complexes contain Hdac1 and Hdac2, whereas Hdac3 is a part of the NCoR-SMRT complex (19Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E. Cell. 1997; 89: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 20You A. Tong J.K. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, class II HDACs can recruit NCoR-SMRT complexes that include Hdac3 (34Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Hendzel M.J. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Voelter W. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). This has suggested that Hdac3 might be functionally related to class II HDAC effects with regard to the regulation of cardiac development and hypertrophy. However, our results suggest that overexpression of Hdac3 in the heart does not significantly affect hypertrophic responsiveness, at least under the conditions tested. HDAC inhibitors are in phase I, II, and III clinical trials for hematological and oncological conditions (30Xu W.S. Parmigiani R.B. Marks P.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5541-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 35Marks P. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Recently, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (also referred to as vorinostat/Zolinza) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (36Garber K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the specific functions of individual HDACs will be important to determine the molecular targets of these inhibitors and to provide information relevant to understanding and preventing potential cardiac side effects. Furthermore, mechanisms to regulate cardiac myocyte proliferation will be applicable to the exploding field of cardiac progenitor cell expansion and therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2044763374,"Uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein expressed most abundantly in skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent in heart and brown adipose tissue. Evidence supports a role for UCP3 in fatty acid oxidation (FAO); however, the underlying mechanism has not been explored. In 2001 we proposed a role for UCP3 in fatty acid export, leading to higher FAO rates (Himms-Hagen, J., and Harper, M. E. (2001) Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood) 226, 78–84). Specifically, this widely held hypothesis states that during elevated FAO rates, UCP3 exports fatty acid anions, thereby maintaining mitochondrial co-enzyme A availability; reactivation of exported fatty acid anions would ultimately enable increased FAO. Here we tested mechanistic aspects of this hypothesis as well as its functional implications, namely increased FAO rates. Using complementary mechanistic approaches in mitochondria from wild-type and Ucp3–/– mice, we find that UCP3 is not required for FAO regardless of substrate type or supply rate covering a 20-fold range. Fatty acid anion export and reoxidation during elevated FAO, although present in skeletal muscle mitochondria, are independent of UCP3 abundance. Interestingly, UCP3 was found to be necessary for the fasting-induced enhancement of FAO rate and capacity, possibly via mitigated mitochondrial oxidative stress. Thus, although our observations indicate that UCP3 can impact FAO rates, the mechanistic basis is not via an integral function for UCP3 in the FAO machinery. Overall our data indicate a function for UCP3 in mitochondrial adaptation to perturbed cellular energy balance and integrate previous observations that have linked UCP3 to reduced oxidative stress and FAO.

Nedergaard J. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4459) Google Scholar). UCP3 shares 57% amino acid homology with UCP1, has the same predicted tertiary structure, and like UCP1, possesses a nucleotide binding domain (2Jezek P. Urbankova E. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 63-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nedergaard J. Golozoubova V. Matthias A. Asadi A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 82-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). UCP3 protein is most abundant in skeletal muscle and is present to a lesser extent in brown adipose tissue and heart (4Harper M.E. Dent R.M. Bezaire V. Antoniou A. Gauthier A. Monemdjou S. McPherson R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 768-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to UCP1, the physiological role and underlying mechanism of action of UCP3 are as yet unresolved. A proposed function for UCP3 is in lipid metabolism (5Samec S. Seydoux J. Dulloo A.G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 6Samec S. Seydoux J. Dulloo A.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1693-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and supportive evidence has accrued. In Gullah African-Americans an exon 6 splice junction polymorphism resulting in a truncated form of UCP3 was associated with lower fatty acid oxidation (FAO) as assessed by indirect calorimetry (7Argyropoulos G.

Although these studies functionally link UCP3 and increased FAO, the underlying mechanism remains unexplored, including whether the association between UCP3 and FAO may be related to reduced oxidative stress (13MacLellan J.D.

Two hypotheses of UCP3-mediated fatty acid handling propose that UCP3 transports fatty acid anions from the mitochondrial matrix (20Himms-Hagen J. Harper M.E. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2001; 226: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 21Schrauwen P. Saris W.H. Hesselink M.K. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2497-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2497-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) suggest the physiological outcome to be reduced matrix lipotoxicity. We, on the other hand, proposed a UCP3 export function that leads to increased FAO (20Himms-Hagen J. Harper M.E. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2001; 226: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Specifically, when fatty acyl supply is high, UCP3 would act in concert with mitochondrial thioesterase-1 (MTE-1), which cleaves long chain acyl-CoA into fatty acid anions and CoA (22Hunt M. Lindquist P.J. Nousiainen S. Svensson T.L. Diczfalusy U. Alexson S.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 466: 195-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hunt M.C. Nousiainen S.E. Huttunen M.K. Orii K.E. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34317-34326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fatty acid anions, which cannot be reactivated in the matrix, would be exported by UCP3 to the cytosol to be reactivated then oxidized or esterified (Fig. 1). This mechanism would provide an overflow pathway when fatty acid supply exceeds oxidation capacity, liberating CoA to replenish the matrix CoA pool; a predicted functional consequence is that FAO rate is impaired in the absence or limited presence of UCP3 or enhanced with increased expression. Although supportive evidence has emerged (7Argyropoulos G. Brown A.M. Willi S.M. Zhu J. He Y. Reitman M. Gevao S.M. Spruill I. Garvey W.T. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 8Bezaire V. Hofmann W. Kramer J.K. Kozak L.P. Harper M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 977-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), this hypothesis has not been explicitly tested. Here we tested the metabolic and mechanistic predictions that 1) UCP3 is associated with greater maximal but not submaximal FAO and 2) UCP3 exports fatty acid anions when fatty acid flux is high. Using a unique experimental approach that links mechanism with integrated mitochondrial metabolism, we find that mitochondria from wild-type (WT) and Ucp3–/– mouse equally export palmitate even when UCP3 protein expression is increased in WT mitochondria; thus, UCP3 does not play a unique role in the export process. UCP3 is also not required for FAO in mitochondria from fed mice regardless of substrate type and oxidation rate covering a ∼20-fold span; thus, UCP3 is not required for the minimal mitochondrial machinery that oxidizes fatty acids. However, important limitations in FAO are observed in Ucp3–/– mouse mitochondria after increased in vivo fatty acid supply, pointing to a role for UCP3 in mitochondrial adaptation of FAO to fasting, possibly via mitigated oxidative stress. Treatment of Animals—Male and female WT and Ucp3–/– mice (n = 30/genotype) were housed individually from weaning at 23 °C, lights on 0700–1900, and studied at 10–12 weeks of age. Ucp3–/– mice, backcrossed 10 generations into the C57Bl6/J background, have been described (14Bezaire V. Spriet L.L. Campbell S. Sabet N. Gerrits M. Bonen A. Harper M.E. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 977-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15Costford S.R. Chaudhry S.N. Salkhordeh M. Harper M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mice had free access to chow (4.5% fat/weight; Charles River 5075). Subgroups (n = 16/genotype) were fasted for 18 h overnight with free access to water. A narrow age range and equal numbers of males and females were used. Experiments were paired by genotype (WT versus Ucp3–/–) or feeding status (fed versus fast). Animals were sacrificed at 08:00–10:00 for mitochondrial isolations. Animals were cared for according to the principles and guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (National Research Council). The study was approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Ottawa. Isolation of Mitochondria from Skeletal Muscle—Isolation of skeletal muscle mitochondria was performed essentially according to Chappell and Perry (24Chappell J.B. Perry S.V. Nature. 1954; 173: 1094-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). All media were ice-cold, and the procedure was done on ice or at 4 °C. Briefly, pectoral, forelimb, and hindlimb muscles were rapidly dissected and placed in basic medium (BM: 140 mm KCl, 20 mm, HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.0). Muscle was cleaned of connective tissue and fat, minced, and placed in 15 volumes of homogenizing medium (HM: BM with 1 mm ATP and 1% BSA (w/v)) containing one unit of protease (subtilisin A, Sigma P5459) per g of muscle wet weight. Tissue was homogenized using a glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder and fractionated by centrifugation at 800 × g (10 min), and the supernatant was collected and spun at 12,000 × g (10 min). The pellet was resuspended in BM and incubated on ice for 3 min (myofibrillar repolymerization). Samples were spun at 800 × g (10 min), and the supernatant was collected, then spun at 12,000 × g (10 min). The final pellet was resuspended in 220 μl of BM. Respiratory control ratio (state 3/state 4) of mitochondria fed pyruvate/malate was 7–8. Protein concentration was determined by a modified Lowry method with BSA as standard. Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation—FAO was assessed as described (25Glatz J.F. Jacobs A.E. Veerkamp J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 794: 454-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Veerkamp J.H. Van Moerkerk H.T. Glatz J.F. Van Hinsbergh V.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 753: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Labeled CO2 and carbon fixation in acid-soluble products (ASP) generated by fatty acid (palmitate, palmitoylcarnitine) oxidation were measured after a 30-min incubation (37 °C) of viable mitochondria in a sealed system. A 1500-μl aliquot of incubation medium (IM: 120 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm ATP, 0.05 mm malate, 0.025 mm coenzyme A, and 0.5 mm carnitine was added to a 20-ml glass vial. Free CoA and carnitine were omitted for palmitoylcarnitine oxidation unless indicated. Substrates were added to vials in a 6:1 fatty acid-BSA complex and spiked with [1-14C]palmitoylcarnitine (10 nCi; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or [1-14C]palmitate (10 nCi; Amersham Biosciences). Final concentrations of fatty acid substrate ranged from 1.2 to 38 μm. The 20-ml vial contained a microcentrifuge tube with 300 μl of 1 m benzethonium hydroxide to capture 14CO2. The reaction was initiated by adding mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml), then terminated after 30 min by adding ice-cold 12 n perchloric acid by syringe through the rubber cap. A fraction of the reaction medium was analyzed for [14C]ASP, whereas the remaining mixture was acidified, and gaseous 14CO2 was trapped and counted. Western Blotting—UCP3 (1:1000; AbCam), MTE-1 (1:1500; a gift from Dr. Stefan Alexson), PDK4 (1:500, a gift from Dr. Robert Harris), MnSOD (1:2000; Santa Cruz sc-30080), and UCP2 (1:500; Santa-Cruz sc-6526) protein was determined in isolated mitochondria (UCP3 and MTE-1, 35 μg; PDK4, 8 μg; MnSOD, 15 μg; UCP2, 30–60 μg). Band intensity was measured by densitometry (Scion Image software) and expressed relative to the intensity of a band of similar Mr on the control (Coomassie-stained gel or Ponceau-stained membrane). Palmitate Generation and Export Measurements—Generation and export of [1-14C]palmitate were determined essentially according to Gerber (27Gerber L.K. Aronow B.J. Matlib M.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: 1198-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated mitochondria (1 mg) were incubated with 19 μm palmitoylcarnitine as above and spiked with 200 nCi of [1-14C]palmitoylcarnitine. The reaction was terminated by removing half the suspension and mixing it with an equal volume of IM and 3 volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v:v). The remaining suspension was filtered across a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) presoaked for 40 min in IM containing 0.66 mg/ml BSA and 20 μm unlabeled palmitate. The filter was washed with 3 volumes of IM supplemented with 2 mg/ml BSA; nitrocellulose membrane incubation length with BSA and the chosen BSA concentrations and volumes of washing IM buffer stated above yielded the highest recovery rate (83 ± 4.3 (S.D.) %, n = 5) of [1-14C]palmitate added to a 1.0-mg suspension of nonfunctional mitochondria. Therefore, a ∼17% loss of [1-14C]palmitate is accounted for by non-metabolic processes such as fatty acid binding to mitochondrial membranes. Three volumes of chloroform:methanol were then added to the filtrate. Sample blanks were run and processed as above to account for any contaminating [1-14C]-palmitate. Lipids were extracted according to Folch (28Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The organic fraction was collected and dried under nitrogen, resuspended in ethanol, and applied onto a 250-μm silica gel plate (Analtech). After migration in a hexane:diethyl ether:formic acid (50:50:1, v:v:v) solvent system, palmitate bands were scraped off, and radioactivity was counted. Enzyme Activities—Activities of citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7) (29Srere P.A. Lowenstein J.M. Methods in Enzymology. 8. Academic Press, Inc., New York1969: 3-5Google Scholar) and β-hydroxyacyl dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35) (30Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. 1. Weinheim Verlag Chemie, New York1974: 474-476Google Scholar) were measured at 25 °C in previously frozen mitochondria after 3 freeze-thaw cycles and exposure to 0.04% Triton X-100. Malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) activity (31Stallknecht B. Vinten J. Ploug T. Galbo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E410-E414PubMed Google Scholar) was determined at 25 °C in freshly isolated mitochondria before and after oxidation with 19 μm palmitoylcarnitine (PCarn). Mitochondria were assayed before and after the addition of 0.04% Triton X-100. Oxidative Stress—Oxidative stress was assessed in mitochondrial extracts from fed and fasted mice by immunoblot detection of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)-modified proteins (the stable fluorophore resulting from lysine-HNE cross-links (32Benderdour M.

Reactive oxygen species production during PCarn oxidation was determined in freshly isolated mitochondria by measuring H2O2 generation using the p-hydroxyphenylacetate fluorometric assay (35Hyslop P.A. Sklar L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 36Bevilacqua L. Ramsey J.J. Hagopian K. Weindruch R. Harper M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Statistical Analyses—Paired and unpaired t tests and 2-way mixed analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-tests were performed using Prism software. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Absence of UCP3 in Skeletal Muscle Does Not Impair Palmitate Oxidation Even at Elevated Fatty Acid Supply Rates—Wild-type and Ucp3–/– mice were congenic, with Ucp3–/– mice backcrossed 10 generations onto the WT C57Bl6/J background (14Bezaire V.

(Maywood). 2001; 226: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), MTE-1 would work in concert with UCP3 to cleave fatty acyl-CoA into fatty acid anion and CoASH and export fatty acid anions from the matrix. MTE-1, one of three such thioesterases identified (23Hunt M.C. Nousiainen S.E. Huttunen M.K. Orii K.E. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34317-34326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), is the mitochondrial isoform specific for C14–C20 fatty acyl-CoA moieties (37Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12177-12183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38Svensson L.T. Engberg S.T. Aoyama T. Usuda N. Alexson S.E. Hashimoto T. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). MTE-1 protein levels were similar in WT and UCP3 null mitochondria (Fig. 2B). To directly test the functional implications of the hypothesis that UCP3 is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid efflux in conditions of elevated fatty acid supply, we first compared FAO rates in WT and Ucp3–/– mitochondria from fed mice-oxidizing substrate at low, intermediate, and high rates; experiments in isolated mitochondria allow investigation of a mitochondria-autonomous mechanism of UCP3-mediated FAO. With palmitate as substrate, the entire FAO pathway is operational, including putative export, reactivation, re-uptake, and oxidation arms (Fig. 1). Complete and incomplete oxidation rates were assessed, respectively, as CO2 release and ASP accumulation. FAO rates in mitochondria, optimized for coenzyme A, carnitine, ATP, and malate concentrations, were similar to those reported (39Koves T.R. Li P. An J. Akimoto T. Slentz D. Ilkayeva O. Dohm G.L. Yan Z. Newgard C.B. Muoio D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33588-33598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 40Lin C.H. Hudson A.J. Strickland K.P. Can J. Biochem. 1970; 48: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In WT mitochondria, CO2 production rates increased linearly with palmitate concentration up to 9 μm, beyond which rates leveled off, indicating saturation of complete FAO (Fig. 2C); ASP progressively increased, again consistent with saturation of complete FAO (Fig. 2D). CO2 and ASP production rates at low, medium, and elevated palmitate concentrations were similar for WT and Ucp3–/– mitochondria; thus, the absence of UCP3 does not limit palmitate oxidation over a wide range of oxidation rates in mitochondria from fed mice. Palmitoylcarnitine Oxidation and Its Modulation by Free Carnitine Are Unaffected by Ucp3 Ablation—To further examine the role of UCP3 in FAO, we assessed PCarn oxidation at low and high concentrations. Palmitoylcarnitine uptake bypasses carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, and in the absence of added CoA, reactivation and metabolism of any exported fatty acids cannot occur. At low PCarn concentrations (2 μm), CO2 and ASP production rates were similar in WT and Ucp3–/– mitochondria (Fig. 3, A and B). A PCarn dose-response analysis was performed to identify the concentration that yielded maximal CO2 production with minimal variability (not shown). Saturating PCarn (19 μm) increased CO2 and ASP production rates by ∼10-fold (p < 0.001) as compared with 2 μm PCarn, an effect observed equally in WT and Ucp3–/– mitochondria. In mitochondrial preparations from skeletal muscle, heart and liver, extra-mitochondrial free carnitine facilitates export of acetylcarnitine (41Brass E.P. Hoppel C.L. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 42Lysiak W. Lilly K. DiLisa F. Toth P.P. Bieber L.L. J. Biol.

(Lond.). 2007; 581: 431-444Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The concept of carnitine-mediated export has been extended to acylcarnitine (44Eaton S. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 197-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 45Muoio D.M. Newgard C.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 367-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), although to our knowledge there are no published data that demonstrate long-chain acylcarnitine efflux from the mitochondrial matrix and especially from intact cells or organs. On the other hand, it is worth noting that C16 acylcarnitine can be detected in rat plasma and skeletal muscle, and levels in both compartments increase in response to high fat feeding (46Koves T.R. Ussher J.R. Noland R.C. Slentz D. Mosedale M. Ilkayeva O. Bain J. Stevens R. Dyck J.R. Newgard C.B. Lopaschuk G.D. Muoio D.M. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Moreover, carnitine supplementation in an obese diabetic mouse model (BAP-Agouti mice) increased both muscle and plasma levels of long chain acylcarnitines (47Power R.A. Hulver M.W. Zhang J.Y. Dubois J. Marchand R.M. Ilkayeva O. Muoio D.M. Mynatt R.L. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 824-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In neither of these two studies was compartmentalization of long chain acylcarnitine species within the muscle determined. The functional outcome of carnitine-driven export of acetylcarnitine and short-chain acylcarnitines (and the putative export of long chain acylcarnitines) is similar to that proposed for UCP3-mediated fatty acid export; that is, preservation of a sufficient pool of CoA in the matrix under conditions of elevated fatty acid supply, thereby preventing limitation in FAO. We, therefore, examined the effect of carnitine on PCarn oxidation in Ucp3–/– mitochondria. The addition of 0.5 mm carnitine expanded the ASP pool in WT and Ucp3–/– mitochondria to a similar extent (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3D) and tended to decrease CO2 production rates (Fig. 3C). These findings are in line with a role for carnitine in mitochondrial CoA buffering, as short and medium chain acyl moieties are commonly found in the ASP fraction (41Brass E.P. Hoppel C.L. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 48Brass E.P. Hoppel C.L. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If both carnitine and UCP3 were involved in this buffering process, carnitine-driven expansion of the ASP pool would be greater in Ucp3–/– mitochondria; however, this was not the case, indicating that this process was not functionally compensating for UCP3 absence. Palmitate Is Generated and Exported from Skeletal Muscle Mitochondria of WT and Ucp3–/– Mice—We next determined whether a fatty acid export process occurs in skeletal muscle mitochondria and, if so, whether UCP3 plays a unique role. To this end we supplied WT and Ucp3–/– mitochondria with saturating concentrations of [1-14C]PCarn during a 30-min incubation period and assessed [1-14C]palmitate generation by thin layer chromatography. The product ([1-14C]palmitate) was easily identified from the substrate because the former migrated with a retention factor of 0.82 ± 0.01, whereas the latter remained at the origin. When supplied with 19 μm PCarn, WT and Ucp3–/– mitochondria generated palmitate at similar rates (Fig. 4A). Localization of palmitate to mitochondria or buffer (i.e. exported palmitate) was assessed by filtering the reaction mixture across a nitrocellulose membrane. The majority of generated palmitate was exported from both WT and Ucp3–/– samples, and this exported fraction was similar in both genotypes (Fig. 4A). Movement of palmitate from mitochondria to buffer was not related to mitochondrial membrane rupture since activity of a matrix marker, malate d"
https://openalex.org/W2091546407,"The substrate of matrix metalloproteinase 11 (MMP11) remains unknown. We have recently shown that MMP11 is a negative regulator of adipogenesis, able to reduce and even to revert mature adipocyte differentiation. Here, we have used mouse 3T3L1 cells and human U87MG and SaOS cells to show that MMP11 cleaves the native α3 chain of collagen VI, which is an adipocyte-related extracellular matrix component. It is known that extracellular proteolytic processing of this chain is required for correct collagen VI folding. Interestingly, MMP11-deficient fat tissue is less cohesive and exhibits collagen VI alteration, dramatic adipocyte plasma and basement membrane abnormalities and lipid leakage. MMP11 is thus required for correct collagen VI folding and therefore for fat tissue cohesion and adipocyte function. Both MMP11 and collagen VI favor tumor progression. Similar spatio-temporal overexpression at the adipocyte–cancer cell interface has been reported for the two proteins. MMP11-dependent collagen VI processing might therefore be expected to occur during malignancy. Accordingly, collagen VI no longer delineates adipocytes located at the invasive front of breast carcinomas. In conclusion, the native α3 chain of collagen VI constitutes a specific MMP11 substrate. This MMP11 collagenolytic activity is functional in fat tissue ontogenesis as well as during cancer invasive steps."
https://openalex.org/W2042571711,"Microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1 (MAGP-1) is a small molecular weight component of the fibrillin-rich microfibril. Gene-targeted inactivation of MAGP-1 reveals a complex phenotype that includes increased body weight and size due to excess body fat, an altered wound healing response in bone and skin, and a bleeding diathesis. Elastic tissues rich in MAGP-1-containing microfibrils develop normally and show normal function. The penetrance of MAGP-1-null phenotypes is highly variable and mouse strain-dependent, suggesting the influence of modifier genes. MAGP-1 was found to bind active transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and BMP-7 with high affinity, suggesting that it may be an important modulator of microfibril-mediated growth factor signaling. Many of the phenotypic traits observed in MAGP-1-deficient mice are consistent with loss of TGF-beta function and are generally opposite those associated with mutations in fibrillin-1 that result in enhanced TGF-beta signaling. Increased body size and fat deposition in MAGP-1-mutant animals are particularly intriguing given the localization of obesity traits in humans to the region on chromosome 1 containing the MAGP-1 gene."

The interaction of MUC1 cytoplasmic tail (MUC1CT) with signal transducers and its nuclear translocation and subsequent biological responses are believed to be regulated by phosphorylation status, but the precise mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly defined. We detected a novel association between the Met receptor tyrosine kinase and the MUC1CT. Met catalyzed phosphorylation of tyrosine at YHPM in the MUC1CT.

MUC1 overexpression also facilitated faster turnover of Met. Phosphorylation of MUC1CT by Met enhanced its interaction with p53, which led to suppression of AP1 transcription factor activity through interactions at the MMP1 promoter, ultimately leading to reduced transcription of MMP1.

Co-translational proteolytic cleavage of the full-length protein results in two associated fragments as follows: a large extracellular polypeptide containing the tandem repeat domain that can be released from the cell surface; and a polypeptide consisting of the short extracellular region, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic tail that exists as an integral membrane protein (8.Singh P.K.

Changes in the phosphorylation status of MUC1CT are believed to modulate its affinity for mediators of signal transduction, including β-catenin, p53, and Grb2-SOS.The processes that regulate phosphorylation of the MUC1CT and the specific kinases that catalyze these reactions are now being elucidated. The MUC1CT is a substrate for GSK3β, c-Src, EGFR, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (10.Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell.

We present evidence that the Met receptor tyrosine kinase interacts with MUC1 in pancreatic cancer cells, and catalyzes phosphorylation of the MUC1CT in response to stimulation by HGF. Overexpression of MUC1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells down-regulated conventional Met-mediated signaling and inhibited motility and invasion. HGF stimulation facilitated interaction of MUC1CT with p53, enabled p53-mediated suppression of AP1 transcriptional activity, and decreased MMP1 expression. We conclude that Met-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1 modulates signaling related to motility and invasion in pancreatic cancer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Panc-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

HPAF2 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin under similar conditions.Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysate proteins were resolved on 10 or 14% NOVEX Tris-glycine denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) in a 1× SDS-PAGE buffer (1 g/liter SDS, 3 g/liter Tris base, and 14.4 g/liter glycine). Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (14.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar).Biotinylation Assay—Cells serum-starved for 24 h were surface-biotinylated with EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) on ice followed by washing and quenching of free biotin, and then incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml HGF (100 ng/ml, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 2 h. Following the 2-h incubation, cell monolayers were glutathione-stripped as described by Graeve et al. (25.Graeve L. Drickamer K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in two 20-min washes of glutathione solution (60 mm glutathione, 0.083 m NaCl, with 0.083 m NaCl, and 1% bovine serum albumin added before use) at 0 °C to remove the cell surface biotin groups. The remaining biotinylated proteins, which were endocytosed prior to biotin stripping, were recovered from the RIPA cell lysates by incubation with neutravidin beads (Pierce).In Vitro Kinase Assay—1 μg of peptides in 10 μl of reaction buffer (Met reaction buffer: 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min along with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 500 ng of active human recombinant Met (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY). The reaction was stopped by boiling the samples in reducing SDS-sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 16% Tricine gel. The gel was dried and analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis.Metabolic Labeling of Cells and Radioimmunoprecipitation Analysis—Metabolic labeling was performed as described previously (13.Singh P.K.

Briefly, HPAF2 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and incubated in phosphate-free minimum essential medium at 37 °C for 2 h prior to labeling with 2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN, Irvine, CA) for 2 h in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml HGF. Whole cell lysates were prepared with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Radiolabeled MUC1CT was immunoprecipitated by incubation with mAb CT2 (mAb against MUC1CT) and resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 14% gel.Tandem MS Analysis of MUC1CT and Its Association Partners—Immunoprecipitated MUC1CT from cell lysates or in vitro phosphorylated MUC1CT peptides were resolved on 14% NOVEX Tris-glycine denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), silver-stained, and then individual bands were excised and trypsin-digested. Eluted peptides were analyzed using a Q-TOF Ultima tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass/Waters) with electrospray ionization as described previously (13.Singh P.K. Wen Y. Swanson B.J. Shanmugam K.

S2-013.MUC1F, S2-013.CT3, and S2-013.Neo cells (5 × 104) were seeded onto the upper chamber, which also had a coating of Matrigel in the invasion chambers. The lower chamber contained Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 100 ng/ml HGF. The chambers were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h in a CO2 incubator. Cells on the upper portion of the membrane were wiped off with a cotton-tipped swab, and cells on the bottom of this membrane were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick staining kit (Allegiance) and observed by light microscopy. The numbers of invading cells were counted in five randomly selected observation fields per membrane at ×200 magnification.Plasmids, Transient Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—MMP-1 luciferase reporter, wild type or mutated at the first ETS site 388/385 (GGAT to AAAT), AP-1-binding site (370 to 368 from GTC to TGG), or the second ETS site 348/345 (GGAA to AAAA) were a kind gift from Dr. Ralf Janknecht (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) (26.Fuchs B. Inwards C.Y. Janknecht R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An AP1-responsive luciferase plasmid was obtained from Promega. PGL2 basic was used as a control plasmid for transfection in luciferase studies. A dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega) was used to detect promoter activity in this study. A synthetic Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega) was used as a control for transfection efficiency. 10,000 cells/well were seeded into a 48-well plate and grown to ∼60% confluence and then serum-starved for 24 h and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), with and without 100 ng/ml HGF, and cultured for another 24 h. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with 200 μl of Passive Lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for the luciferase activities. Each experiment was performed three times in triplicate.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—5.0 × 107 S2-013MUC1F cells were prepared for ChIP assays by cross-linking for 30 min with 50 mm (10-fold molar excess) dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate·2 HCl (Pierce), followed by 10 min of cross-linking with 1% formaldehyde. The cross-linkers were quenched with 125 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped and sonicated to an average of 500 bp to prepare the chromatin as per the Affymetrix ChIP protocol, which was subjected to immunoprecipitation with either CT2 or IgG control. The immunoprecipitants were washed and eluted as suggested by the protocol, and 3.0 μl of the eluted product was subjected to real time PCR using primer sets for pGUSB (Superarray Bioscience Corp., Frederick, MD), pMMP1 (forward, TGGCAGAGTGTGTCTCCTTCGC; reverse, TCGAAGGTAAGTGATGGCTTCC), or a control region 1.5 kb upstream of pMMP1 (forward, TGCCTAGCACCAAGGAGCGAAGA; reverse, CGGAGTATGAGATAACTCCCC) as described in the Superarray protocol.Statististical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of 3–5 independent experiments, each treatment performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS or GraphPad Prism statistical software. Student's t test was used when appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSMUC1CT Interacts with Met—Proteomics techniques were used to identify proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with MUC1 from S2-013 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, a moderately differentiated human pancreatic tumor cell line known to express O-glycosylated mucin-like proteins, including low levels of endogenous MUC1 (18.Iwamura T.

A cDNA construct encoding a FLAG epitope-tagged form of MUC1 (7.Burdick M.D. Harris A. Reid C.J. Iwamura T. Hollingsworth M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24198-24202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was overexpressed in the these cells (S2-013.MUC1F). Immunoprecipitations with the CT2 antibody, which binds to MUC1CT, were resolved on Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and silver-stained (supplemental Fig. 1). Bands representing specific proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with MUC1 and were absent from isotype control lanes were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and MS/MS analysis for protein identification. A fragment corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of Met, FTVKVADFGLAR, was identified by this approach (Fig. 1A).We performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations of MUC1 and Met from cell lysates of three human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines as follows: Panc1.MUC1F (a poorly differentiated cell line overexpressing a FLAG-tagged MUC1 construct); S2-013.MUC1F; and HPAF2 (a highly differentiated cell line with high endogenous levels of MUC1). Immunoprecipitations utilizing anti-cytoplasmic tail antibodies for both molecules (Fig. 1B) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE to facilitate separation of pre-Met (unprocessed form) and Met and Western blotted, and the membranes were probed with HMFG-2 (a monoclonal antibody against the tandem repeat region of MUC1) or an antibody against the Met cytoplasmic tail. The immunoblotting results revealed consistent interactions between MUC1 and Met in S2-013.MUC1F and HPAF2 cells, and a weaker interaction was observed for Panc-1.MUC1F cells. Although the reason for the weaker interaction between MUC1 and Met in Panc1.MUC1F cells is not definitively known at this time, it is known that Panc1 is a poorly differentiated pancreatic cancer cell line (27.Batra S.K. Kern H.F. Worlock A.J. Metzgar R.S. Hollingsworth M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 841-849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that attaches core 1 type short oligosaccharides (e.g. sialyl-Tn and sialyl-T) to MUC1 because of a lack of expression of core 2 GlcNAc transferase activity (28.Beum P.V.

In contrast, S2-013 and HPAF2 are moderately and well differentiated pancreatic cancer cell lines, respectively, that attach to MUC1 extended oligosaccharides such as sialyl Lewis A (7.Burdick M.D. Harris A. Reid C.J. Iwamura T. Hollingsworth M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24198-24202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and sialyl Lewis C. This raises the possibility that glycosylation of MUC1 influences its ability to interact with Met. Both pre-Met and Met were found to interact with MUC1.MUC1 Facilitates Faster Turnover of Met—Because MUC1 and Met were in complex, we sought to determine whether overexpression of MUC1 modulates stability of Met by performing cell surface biotinylation experiments (25.Graeve L. Drickamer K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). S2-013.MUC1F and S2-013.Neo cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then surface-biotinylated with a cell-impermeable biotinylation reagent. The surface-biotinylated cells were stimulated with HGF (100 ng/ml) for 0, 15, 60, or 120 min. The cells were glutathione-stripped to remove biotin from the nonendocytosed cell surface proteins, thus specifically biotin-labeling proteins that were endocytosed. Ammonium chloride was used to block lysosomal degradation of endocytosed proteins. Proteins from whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by using Neutravidin beads and subsequently immunoblotted for Met. HGF stimulation caused a significant reduction in total levels of Met protein in a temporal manner in S2-013.MUC1F cells (Fig. 2A). However, steady state levels of Met were comparatively stable in S2-013.Neo cells (which do not overexpress MUC1), suggesting that MUC1 overexpression facilitated faster turnover of Met during stimulation with HGF. The increased turnover of Met in S2-013.MUC1F cells following HGF stimulation was also associated with reduced binding to Gab1, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). However, the interactions of Met with Gab1 were higher in S2-013.MUC1F cells under serum-starved steady state conditions, as compared with the S2-013.Neo cells.FIGURE 2MUC1 promotes endocytosis, lysosomal degradation, and reduced signaling of Met.A, effect of MUC1 overexpression on Met endocytosis was determined in S2-013.MUC1F or S2-013.neo cells. Serum-starved cells were surface-biotinylated on ice and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the absence (serum-free or SF) or presence of HGF (H) to allow endocytosis. Surface-biotinylated proteins from RIPA lysates were recovered on neutravidin beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with a polyclonal Ab against Met. 1st 3 lanes indicate the total levels of surface-biotinylated Met after 2 h of incubation at 0, 37, or 37 °C in the presence of HGF and ammonium chloride, and 4th to 6th lanes represent the levels of endocytosed Met (detected by glutathione stripping or GS) under serum-free conditions or HGF stimulation with and without ammonium chloride. B, effect of HGF stimulation on Met signaling. S2-013.MUC1F or S2-013.neo cells were stimulated with HGF for different times.

Autoradiograms from 32P-labeled in vitro kinase reactions showed phosphorylation of MUC1CT-p66 in the presence of Met (Fig. 3A, 3rd lane). No phosphorylation was observed in the absence of peptide (Fig. 3A, 2nd lane), or kinase (1st lane). Parallel reactions were applied to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). Bands corresponding to the MUC1CT peptide were digested with trypsin and sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometric analysis of MUC1CT revealed phosphorylation at tyrosine at the YHPM motif (or Tyr-1203, NCBI accession number P15941; Fig. 3B). Furthermore, MUC1CT peptide synthetically pre-phosphorylated at tyrosine in the YHPM motif (MUC1CT-p66-pYHPM) was not phosphorylated by Met (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Met mediates phosphorylation and nuclear localization of MUC1CT.A, recombinant active Met kinase phosphorylated MUC1CT-p66. MUC1CT-p66 or MUC1CTp66-pYHPM peptides were incubated with Met kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP.

HPAF2 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (250μCi/ml) in the presence (3rd lane) or absence (1st lane) of human recombinant HGF (100 ng/ml), lysed in RIPA buffer, immunoprecipitated (IP) with mAb CT2, and subjected to autoradiography or immunoblotting with mAb CT2. Immunoprecipitation with a nonspecific mAb was used as an IP control (2nd lane). Nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) localization of MUC1CT from S2-013.MUC1F cells (D) and HPAF2 cells (E) phosphorylated at tyrosine at the YHPM site were determined by Western blotting with phosphorylation site-specific antibody. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was reprobed with antibodies against H2B and β-actin as controls for protein loading. F, left panel, S2-013.MUC1.CT-EYFP cells expressing MUC1 with C-terminally tagged EYFP were utilized for real time laser scanning confocal microscopy. The first two scans were taken under serum-starved conditions, and HGF (100 ng/ml) was added to the culture disk right after the second scan, and successive scans were taken for 15 min, every 10 s at 37 °C at ×100 magnification. After the first 15 min, the rest of the scans were performed every 2.5 min for a total period of 4 h. Representative real time confocal scans of a cluster of cells and a single cell are presented here. G, S2-013.MUC1F or S2-013.MUC1FHPM cells were serum-starved for 24 h, stimulated with HGF for 15 min, or left unstimulated, fixed, and permeabilized before incubation with mAb CT2 and the nuclear dye propidium iodide. The mAb CT2 (anti-MUC1CT) was visualized as blue (right panel) and detected by using a Cy5-conjugated secondary antibody, and nuclei were visualized in red.

MUC1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with CT2 mAb and separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was then subjected to autoradiography. Cell lysates from unstimulated cells and lysates immunoprecipitated with an isotype identical Ab were used as controls. A duplicate gel was immunoblotted with CT2 antibody to identify the MUC1CT bands.

Consequently, the cellular content of chlorophyll-binding proteins was highly inadequate, especially that of proteins of photosystem II.

The iron branch insertion of Fe2+ into PIX by ferrochelatase leads to the formation of protoheme, whereas in the magnesium branch magnesium chelatase catalyzes the chelation of Mg2+ into PIX, thereby directing tetrapyrroles into Chl synthesis.Cyanobacteria and plants accumulate various tetrapyrrole species in different quantities in the cell. Unlike plants, which use Chl-containing antenna complexes for light harvesting, the major light-harvesting antennae of cyanobacteria consist of phycobiliproteins, which contain covalently bound phycobilines originating from heme. Thus, in cyanobacteria PIX might be directed into the iron branch to a much larger extent than in plants. Regulation of the PIX distribution at the branch point between the magnesium and iron pathways as well as coordination of tetrapyrrole and cognate apoprotein synthesis are substantial in order to avoid accumulation of photoreactive intermediates during tetrapyrrole synthesis. For instance, in plants the genes coding for the light-harvesting Chl-a/b-binding proteins (LHCB) and for Chl biosynthesis proteins are simultaneously up-regulated in the light (5Herrin D.L.

Ausubel F.M. Chory J. Cell. 1993; 74: 787-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The GUN2, GUN3, GUN4, and GUN5 genes encode proteins that are involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis (9Mochizuki N. Brusslan J.A. Larkin R. Nagatani A. Chory J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two of the gene products, GUN2 (heme oxygenase) and GUN3 (biliverdin reductase), function in heme degradation. GUN5 encodes the ChlH subunit of the magnesium chelatase complex (9Mochizuki N.

Science. 2003; 299: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). GUN4-related genes were found only in photosynthetic organisms. In plants GUN4 either is encoded in the nucleus or retained in the chloroplast genome as is the case with several algae, where it was previously designated as ycf53.All cyanobacterial genomes sequenced so far contain one or more gun4-related genes, with the exception of the ancient cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421. An A. thaliana GUN4 mutant forms white-yellow tissue under standard conditions or pale green tissue in dim light (10Larkin R.M. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Chory J. Science. 2003; 299: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The A. thaliana Gun4 protein was co-purified with the ChlH subunit of magnesium chelatase and binds PIX as well as magnesium protoporphyrin IX (MgPIX) (10Larkin R.M. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Chory J. Science. 2003; 299: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In vitro enzyme assays revealed a dramatically increased efficiency of the enzymatic Mg2+ insertion into PIX in the presence of Gun4, especially at low Mg2+ concentrations (10Larkin R.M. Alonso J.M.

Accordingly, the crystal structures of Gun4 proteins from two cyanobacterial species bare a specific porphyrin binding site supporting a function of Gun4 in tetrapyrrole trafficking (11Davison P.A.

Noel J.P. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e151Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).In a previous report we described an incompletely segregated gun4 mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803), arguing for substantial roles of Gun4 in cell metabolism (13Wilde A. Mikolajczyk S. Alawady A. Lokstein H. Grimm B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here, we succeeded in generating a fully segregated gun4 mutant strain in the glucose-tolerant (GT) Synechocystis 6803 wild-type background. The analysis of this strain revealed that the absence of Gun4 strongly decreased Chl biosynthesis and completely abolished photoautotrophic growth. These mutant properties correlated with a drastically impaired assembly of the two photosystems (PS). Among all Chl-binding proteins the accumulation of the PSII subunit CP47 was most strongly affected in the gun4 mutant. The regulatory interaction between Chl synthesis and PS accumulation is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCulture Conditions—Synechocystis 6803 wild-type (GT) and mutant strains were grown at 30 °C in BG-11 medium (14Rippka R. Desrulles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 11: 419-436Google Scholar) containing 5 mm glucose under continuous irradiance of 5 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 (low light intensity) or 50 μmol of photons m–2s–1 (medium light intensity) in rotating Erlenmeyer flasks. For microaerobic growth, the strains were grown under medium light in a 1% CO2, 99% N2 atmosphere. The GT strain originates from the laboratory of W. Vermaas (Arizona State University). Transformants of Synechocystis 6803 were selected on media with increasing concentrations of kanamycin (5 μg up to 40 μgml–1). The gun4 mutant strain was prepared as described in Wilde et al. (13Wilde A. Mikolajczyk S. Alawady A. Lokstein H. Grimm B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Complete segregation of the mutants was confirmed by PCR using primers 5′-CTTCCGCTGGATCACCTTTA-3′ and 5′-GGTAATGACTTCCCCGAAGA-3′.Construction of a Synechocystis 6803 Strain Expressing the 3×FLAG-tagged Gun4 Protein—The coding sequence of the Synechocystis 6803 gun4 gene was amplified using the primers 5′-CATATGTCTGATAATTTGACCGAACTCTCC-3′ and 5′-AGATCTTTACCAACCGTATTGGGACC-3′. An NdeI site that overlaps with the ATG start codon of the gun4 gene was introduced by the forward primer. The PCR product was subcloned into the pDrive vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Two complementary oligonucleotides encoding the 3×FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) were hybridized, thus creating NdeI-compatible overhangs, and then ligated into the NdeI site of the pDrive-gun4 construct. The resultant construct was verified by sequencing. Using NdeI and BglII restriction enzymes, a DNA fragment encoding the FLAG-tagged Gun4 was excised and then ligated into pSK9 vector for chromosomal integration under the control of the copper dependent petJ promoter (15Tous C. Vega-Palas M.A. Vioque A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29059-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which supports low level expression in BG-11 medium. gun4 mutant cells were transformed with the resultant vector pSKgun4FLAG. Transformants were selected on BG-11 agar plates containing 7 μg ml–1 chloramphenicol. For strong expression of the fusion protein under the control of the petJ promoter, cells were grown for at least 7 days in BG-11 medium lacking copper in the trace metal mix.Determination of Enzyme Activity—Cell cultures (800 ml) were pelleted and disrupted with glass beads in PBS, pH 7.5, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Samples were sub-divided for assays of magnesium chelatase and ferrochelatase activities, which were performed according to Papenbrock et al. (16Papenbrock J. Mock H.P. Kruse E. Grimm B. Planta. 1999; 208: 264-273Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A typical assay mix contained 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm PIX for magnesium chelatase or 1 mm DTT, 1% Tween 80, 2.5 mm palmitic acid, 10 mm ZnSO4, and 50 μm PIX for ferrochelatase. The reactions were started by the addition of PIX dissolved in DMSO, and the assay mixtures were further incubated at 28 °C. Reactions were stopped after 0, 20, 40, and 60 min by the addition of an equal volume of methanol to the reaction mixture followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. After the initial methanol extraction all samples were extracted twice with acetone, methanol, 0.1 n NH4OH (10:9:1; v/v/v). Reaction products were quantified by HPLC using authentic porphyrin standards.Determination of Porphyrins—Steady state levels of magnesium porphyrins were analyzed in the exponential growth phase of the cell culture (OD750 nm ∼ 0.5–0.9). Pelleted cells were resuspended in methanol and incubated on ice for 15 min. After a short centrifugation, supernatants were collected, and the pellets were resuspended in methanol, acetone, 0.1 n NH4OH (10:9:1; v/v/v). Supernatants were combined after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min and prepared for HPLC analysis. Extracted porphyrinogens were oxidized by the addition of 5 μl of 1 m acetic acid and 5 μl of 2-butanone peroxide per 200 μl of extract and separated by HPLC (Agilent-1100, Agilent, Waldborn, Germany) on a RP 18 column (Novapak C18, 4-μm particle size, 3.9 × 150 mm; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. Porphyrins were eluted with a linear gradient of solvent B (90% methanol, 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.2) in solvent A (10% methanol, 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.2) as follows: 0 to 100% in 7 min followed by 100% solvent B for 17 min. The eluate was monitored by fluorescence detection. The excitation and emission wavelengths were, respectively: for Proto, 405 and 625 nm; for ZnProto, 416 and 589 nm; for MgProto and MgProtoME, 420 and 595 nm, respectively. Porphyrins were identified and quantified using authentic standards (Fluka, Germany; Porphyrin Products, UT). For quantification of PIX precipitated in growth medium, 100 ml of culture at OD750 ∼ 0.4 were filtered through 4-μm cellulose filters to collect precipitated pigments in growth media. The filter was frozen in liquid nitrogen, powdered in a 2-ml Eppendorf tube, and dissolved in 0.5 ml of alkaline acetone. Acetone was then extracted with 250 μl of hexane to remove Chl. PIX was diluted 50× in DMSO and quantified spectrofluorometrically using an authentic standard (Sigma).Radioactive Labeling of Cells and Preparation of Membranes—Radiolabeling of cells using a mixture of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys (Trans-label, MP Biochemicals, Irvine, CA; final activity, 400 μCi ml–1) was performed at 30 °C for 20 min under illumination with 125 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 as described in a previous study (17Komenda J. Reisinger V. Muller B.C. Dobakova M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For preparation of membrane and cytosolic protein fractions, cells (OD750 ∼ 0.5) were washed and resuspended in thylakoid buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 20% glycerol. The cell suspension was mixed with glass beads and broken in a Mini Bead Beater, and the resulted homogenate was divided into two halves. To prepare a whole cell extract, the first part was solubilized by 1% β-dodecyl maltoside (DM) and centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to discard unbroken cells. The second part was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing soluble proteins was transferred to a new tube. Pelleted membranes were washed 3 times in thylakoid buffer and resuspended in the same buffer containing 1% DM, and unbroken cells were discarded by centrifugation. To prove whether proteins are tightly bound to the membrane, an additional washing step with 2 m NaCl was applied.Protein Analyses—Analysis of membrane proteins under native conditions was performed by Blue Native (BN)-PAGE using the buffer system of Schägger and von Jagow (18Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). The isolated membranes were resuspended in 25 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 25% glycerol. The membranes were then solubilized with DM (DM: Chl = 40 for WT and 160 for gun4–, respectively, w/w) and analyzed at 4 °C in a 4–16% polyacrylamide gel. Protein composition of complexes was then assessed by electrophoresis in a denaturing 12–20% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea (19Komenda J. Lupinkova L. Kopecky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The whole lanes from the BN gel were excised, incubated for 30 min in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% SDS (w/v), and placed on the top of the denaturing gel; two lanes were analyzed in a single denaturing gel. Proteins separated in the gel were either stained by Coomassie Blue or transferred onto a membrane for immunodetection. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Jänsch et al. (20Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For immunodetection proteins were transferred from gels onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunolabeled with specific antibodies. The primary antibodies used in the study were raised in rabbits against (i) residues 58–86 of the spinach D1 polypeptide, (ii) residues 380–394 of barley CP47, (iii) whole recombinant Gun4 and ferrochelatase proteins from Synechocystis 6803 overexpressed in Escherichia coli using the pQE80 expression vector (Qiagen) and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The antibodies against Synechocystis 6803 ChlH and ChlD subunits of the magnesium chelatase were kindly provided by Prof. Neil C. Hunter (University of Sheffield). Protein signals were visualized using the Immobilon Western (Millipore, Bedford, MA) or Supersignal West Pico (Pierce) chemiluminescence detection systems. Purification of 3×FLAG-tagged Gun4 from Synechocystis 6803 was performed from solubilized whole cell extracts as previously described (21Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lünser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Electron Microscopy—Cells were washed twice in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and fixed in a solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm phosphate buffer for 2 h. This was followed by 3 washes in phosphate buffer and post-fixated in 1% OsO4 in 50 mm phosphate buffer for 1 h. Finally, the cells were washed 3 times and embedded in 2% agarose. The segments of agarose with cells were dehydrated in isopropyl alcohol and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife and post-stained for 30 min with 5% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate for 80 s. The samples were examined with a Jeol 1010 electron microscope equipped with CCD camera MegaView III and image processing software Analysis (3.1.110).Absorption Spectra and Pigment Measurements—Absorption spectra of whole cells were measured with a UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (Shimadzu). Chl was extracted from cell pellets (10 ml, OD750 ∼ 0.5) with 100% methanol, and its content was measured spectrophotometrically (22Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedmann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4582) Google Scholar).77 K Fluorescence Emission Spectra—77 K fluorescence emission spectra were measured in liquid nitrogen with an Aminco spectrofluorimeter (Spectronic Unicam) using membranes washed twice with excess of thylakoid buffer. 100 μl of the sample at Chl concentration of 14 μgml–1 were used for the measurement with 2 μm rhodamine as an internal standard. The spectra were normalized to rhodamine peak (573 nm) and multiplied by relative Chl:absorbance ratio for individual strains to indicate their Chl fluorescence per cell. 77 K fluorescence emission spectra were collected using excitation wavelength 435 nm to excite Chla.RESULTSMutant Characterization—We had previously analyzed the role of Synechocystis 6803 Gun4 in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis using a gun4 mutant strain that was not fully segregated under different growth conditions. These gun4 mutant cells had exhibited lower magnesium and ferrochelatase activities accompanied by the accumulation of PIX, the substrate of both enzymes. In the present study we used a GT Synechocystis 6803 strain for mutational analysis. This different lineage of the original Synechocystis 6803 strain is widely used for the dissection and analysis of photosynthetic mutants. Fully segregated PSI, PSII, and Chl biosynthesis mutants could be generated in this genetic background (23Shen G. Vermaas W.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13904-13910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24He Q. Brune D. Nieman R. Vermaas W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).PCR analysis (Fig. 1) revealed that gun4 mutant in the GT substrain of Synechocystis 6803 (hereafter designated gun4–) was completely segregated. In contrast to previous results obtained with the PCC strain of Synechocystis 6803 (13Wilde A. Mikolajczyk S. Alawady A. Lokstein H. Grimm B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), no chromosomal wild-type copies of the gun4 gene were detected. Gun4 inactivation was confirmed by immunoblot analysis, demonstrating the complete lack of Gun4 in protein extracts from the mutant (compare Fig. 3A). Because Gun4-deficient cells lost the ability to grow photoautotrophically, all media were supplemented with 5 mm glucose to support the growth of the gun4 mutant cells. At a medium light intensity (50 μmol of photons m–2 s–1) gun4 mutant cells grew slowly, lost more than 90% of Chl, and accumulated large amounts of PIX (Table 1). In addition, PIX also strongly accumulated in the growth medium leading to the formation of brown porphyrin aggregates. When these aggregates were separated from cells by filtration, more than eight times more PIX was found in gun4– cells compared with the wild type (data not shown). In addition, mutant cells lost substantial amounts of thylakoid membranes (Fig. 2B) at medium light intensity. In contrast, at low light intensity (5 μmol of photons m–2 s–1) growth of the gun4 mutant on glucose (Table 1) was improved, its thylakoid structure (Fig. 2C) rather resembled that of wild type, and endogenous accumulation of PIX was decreased (Table 1). However, even under low light conditions, the Chl content in the mutant was only about 25% that of the wild-type level (Table 1), and the content of the Chl precursor MgPIX monomethyl ester was strongly reduced (Table 1). Similar effects were observed when the gun4 mutant was grown under microaerobic conditions at medium light intensity. Chl content in the mutant increased from 8 to 15%, and the cells contained more thylakoid membranes than under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2D). The negative influence of both light and aerobic conditions on the formation of thylakoid membranes and Chl contents in the gun4 mutant suggests increased light sensitivity and photooxidative damage in the absence of Gun4 at medium light intensity. To prove whether oxidative stress contributes to the gun4– phenotype even at low light intensities, the mutant was grown microaerobically under these light conditions. No further increase in Chl accumulation was observed compared with aerobic growth at low light, and the Chl content in the mutant remained at 25% that of the wild-type level. In addition, the amount of Chl also was not enhanced in gun4 mutant cells, grown aerobically in the dark (data not shown). It was concluded that low light intensity did not photosensitize the mutant cells and did not cause light-dependent oxidative stress. Thus, strains were grown at low light intensities for further experiments.FIGURE 3Localization, quantification, and activities of both chelatases.

To localize Gun4 and the two metal chelatases in cyanobacterial cells, whole cell extracts of wild-type and gun4 mutant cells were fractionated. Proteins of the cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with antibodies. Fig. 3A shows that the ferrochelatase is tightly bound to the membrane, as there is no significant decrease in signal intensity after additional washing of the membranes or treatment with 2 m NaCl. In contrast, the ChlH subunit of magnesium chelatase was detected both in the soluble and in the membrane fractions, whereas the ChlD subunit of the magnesium chelatase appears to be exclusively located in the soluble fraction. Gun4 was mainly detected as a soluble protein and appeared in the membrane fraction only to a minor degree. The substantially lower signal of Gun4 in the membrane fraction after treatment with 2 m NaCl suggests peripheral association of this protein with membranes (Fig. 3A).In the fully segregated gun4 mutant no immune-reacting protein band was detectable using the anti-Gun4 antiserum (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, in contrast to an equal distribution of wild type ChlH subunit of the magnesium chelatase between soluble and membrane fractions, in the gun4 mutant this protein seems be localized mainly in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3A). Intriguingly, gun4– cells contained unequivocally lower amounts of ChlH and ferrochelatase (Fig. 3B) than the wild type. This finding corroborates the decreased activities of both enzymes in vivo (Fig. 3C). Whereas the loss of ferrochelatase activity was proportional to the loss of protein, loss of magnesium chelatase activity could not entirely be attributed to the ChlH deficiency, supporting a direct role of Gun4 for retaining the enzyme activity (10Larkin R.M. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Chory J. Science. 2003; 299: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar).Affinity Purification of 3×FLAG-tagged Gun4—A possible explanation for the decreased activity of both chelatases in the gun4 mutant might be their physical interaction with Gun4. To identify and specify interacting protein partners of Gun4, gun4 mutant cells were engineered to express a 3×FLAG-tagged Gun4 protein. For this purpose we used a vector harboring the petJ promoter, which is induced by copper deficiency and a platform for stable insertion of the construct into the Synechocystis 6803 chromosome. Absorption spectra of whole cells confirmed that expression of 3×FLAG-Gun4 complemented the gun4 mutation (Fig. 4A), indicating the generation and activity of a functional fusion protein. The 3×FLAG-Gun4 fusion protein was expressed during growth in copper-deficient medium and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) as described (21Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lünser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 3×FLAG-Gun4 protein was eluted by the addition of a 3×FLAG peptide and separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, C and D). Cells expressing the non-tagged Gun4 were used as the negative control. Among the proteins co-purified with Gun4, only ChlH was identified by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4C). T"
https://openalex.org/W2132201230,"The processes that underlie the formation of the dominance hierarchy in a group are since long under debate. Models of self-organisation suggest that dominance hierarchies develop by the self-reinforcing effects of winning and losing fights (the so-called winner-loser effect), but according to 'the prior attribute hypothesis', dominance hierarchies develop from pre-existing individual differences, such as in body mass. In the present paper, we investigate the relevance of each of these two theories for the degree of female dominance over males. We investigate this in a correlative study in which we compare female dominance between groups of 22 species throughout the primate order. In our study female dominance may range from 0 (no female dominance) to 1 (complete female dominance). As regards 'the prior attribute hypothesis', we expected a negative correlation between female dominance over males and species-specific sexual dimorphism in body mass. However, to our surprise we found none (we use the method of independent contrasts). Instead, we confirm the self-organisation hypothesis: our model based on the winner-loser effect predicts that female dominance over males increases with the percentage of males in the group. We confirm this pattern at several levels in empirical data (among groups of a single species and between species of the same genus and of different ones). Since the winner-loser effect has been shown to work in many taxa including humans, these results may have broad implications."
https://openalex.org/W1983849957,"The design and construction of novel biological systems by combining basic building blocks represents a dominant paradigm in synthetic biology. Creating and maintaining a database of these building blocks is a way to streamline the fabrication of complex constructs. The Registry of Standard Biological Parts (Registry) is the most advanced implementation of this idea.By analyzing inclusion relationships between the sequences of the Registry entries, we build a network that can be related to the Registry abstraction hierarchy. The distribution of entry reuse and complexity was extracted from this network. The collection of clones associated with the database entries was also analyzed. The plasmid inserts were amplified and sequenced. The sequences of 162 inserts could be confirmed experimentally but unexpected discrepancies have also been identified.Organizational guidelines are proposed to help design and manage this new type of scientific resources. In particular, it appears necessary to compare the cost of ensuring the integrity of database entries and associated biological samples with their value to the users. The initial strategy that permits including any combination of parts irrespective of its potential value leads to an exponential and economically unsustainable growth that may be detrimental to the quality and long-term value of the resource to its users."
https://openalex.org/W2028768193,"Helicobacter pylori persistently colonize the human stomach and have been linked to atrophic gastritis and gastric carcinoma. Although it is well known that H. pylori infection can result in hypochlorhydria, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here we show that VacA permeabilizes the apical membrane of gastric parietal cells and induces hypochlorhydria. The functional consequences of VacA infection on parietal cell physiology were studied using freshly isolated rabbit gastric glands and cultured parietal cells. Secretory activity of parietal cells was judged by an aminopyrine uptake assay and confocal microscopic examination. VacA permeabilization induces an influx of extracellular calcium, followed by activation of calpain and subsequent proteolysis of ezrin at Met(469)-Thr(470), which results in the liberation of ezrin from the apical membrane of the parietal cells. VacA treatment inhibits acid secretion by preventing the recruitment of H,K-ATPase-containing tubulovesicles to the apical membrane of gastric parietal cells. Electron microscopic examination revealed that VacA treatment disrupts the radial arrangement of actin filaments in apical microvilli due to the loss of ezrin integrity in parietal cells. Significantly, expression of calpain-resistant ezrin restored the functional activity of parietal cells in the presence of VacA. Proteolysis of ezrin in VacA-infected parietal cells is a novel mechanism underlying H. pylori-induced inhibition of acid secretion. Our results indicate that VacA disrupts the apical membrane-cytoskeletal interactions in gastric parietal cells and thereby causes hypochlorhydria."

However, nothing is known about the mechanism by which these proteins are involved in pathogenesis. We demonstrate that LigBCen2 binds Ca2+, as evidenced by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, energy dispersive spectrometry, 45Ca overlay, and mass spectrometry, although there is no known motif for Ca2+ binding. LigBCen2 binds four Ca2+ as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The dissociation constant, KD, for Ca2+ binding is 7 μm, as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry and calcium competition experiments. The nature of the Ca2+-binding site in LigB is possibly similar to that seen in the βγ-crystallin superfamily, since structurally, both families of proteins possess the Greek key type fold. The conformation of LigBCen2 was significantly influenced by Ca2+ binding as shown by far- and near-UV CD and by fluorescence spectroscopy. In the apo form, the protein appears to be partially unfolded, as seen in the far-UV CD spectrum, and upon Ca2+ binding, the protein acquires significant β-sheet conformation. Ca2+ binding stabilizes the protein as monitored by thermal unfolding by CD (50.7–54.8 °C) and by differential scanning calorimetry (50.0–55.7 °C). Ca2+ significantly assists the binding of LigBCen2 to the N-terminal domain of fibronectin and perturbs the secondary structure, suggesting the involvement of Ca2+ in adhesion. We demonstrate that LigB is a novel bacterial Ca2+-binding protein and suggest that Ca2+ binding plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.

Apart from these functions, it is also known that host-pathogen interactions of some bacteria are affected by calcium (26Dardanelli M. Angelini J. Fabra A. Can. J.

It appears that Lig proteins do not have any of these known Ca2+-binding motifs. LigBCen2 shows sequence similarity to the c-type lectin domain of other adhesins, including invasin of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and intimin of Escherichia coli (12Palaniappan R.U. Chang Y.F.

Although Lig proteins are likely to play a significant role in pathogenicity, little is known about the mechanisms of action of these proteins. We undertook this study to identify novel properties of Lig proteins. Based on the structural homology of immunoglobulin-like fold with lens βγ-crystallin type Greek key motif (31Goode D. Crabbe M.J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 19: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we wondered if Lig proteins would bind Ca2+ (32Caday C.G. Steiner R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5985-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore performed these studies and report that Ca2+ binds to the high affinity Fn binding region of LigB, LigBCen2. Ca2+ binding increases the stability of LigBCen2 and significantly influences its conformation. Further, we demonstrate that Ca2+ modulates the binding of LigB to N-terminal domain (NTD) of Fn, suggesting that it plays a major role in bacterial infection. Reagents and Antibodies—Calcium Green™-1 was obtained from Molecular Probe (Eugene, OR). Fibronectin (human plasma fibronectin), NTD of Fn, EGTA, Stains-all, sodium chloride, Tris, and calcium chloride were from Sigma.

Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES)—Standard analysis procedures were performed by the Soil and Plant Laboratory (Cornell University) to analyze the total mineral and heavy metal content by ICP-OES (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Protein samples included 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, which contained 150 mm NaCl and 70 μm of LigBCen2 either untreated or treated with 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA, for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound calcium and EGTA were removed to trace levels (<0.1 μg/ml) via extensive dialysis against Chelex-100-treated Tris buffer. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—The molecular weight of purified LigBCen2 protein was analyzed using an Applied Biosystem 4700 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Protein samples (70 μm LigBCen2) were incubated with 1 mm CaCl2, pH7, for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound excess calcium was removed by dialysis against deionized water. Energy-dispersive Spectrometry (EDS)—EDS analyses were performed with a JEOL 8900 electron probe microanalyzer (JEOL, Ltd. Tokyo, Japan). The operating conditions were 10-kV acceleration voltages. Sample preparation is described under “MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry.” Aqueous solutions of proteins were lyophilized, and a powder form of each sample was analyzed by EDS. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—The reaction enthalpy measurements were carried out with a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal Inc.) at 30 °C. Before the ITC experiment, residual Ca2+ was removed from the protein by EDTA incubation, followed by taking EDTA off with Chelex-100 resin-treated Tris pH 7 buffer containing 50 mm KCl. In a typical ITC experiment, the cell contained 1.39 ml of thoroughly degassed 75 μm protein in 50 mm Tris (pH 7) containing 50 mm KCl, titrated against the same buffer containing 7 mm CaCl2. Following thermal equilibration, titrant was added to the 1.39-ml sample at an initial delay of 60 s, and sample in the cell was stirred at 300 rpm by a syringe. After 50 injections, protein was saturated with Ca2+ until there was no further heat change. In another experiment with the same parameters, Mg2+ versus LigBCen2 titration was performed, and after 50 injections the same protein was used for Ca2+ titration. Titration was performed as follows: 50 injections of 3 μl of ligand delivered over 4 s with a 220-s spacing between injections to allow complete equilibrium. Titration of Tris buffer with ligand was performed with the same parameters as mentioned above, and these reference data (heat of dilution) were subtracted with standard. Data were analyzed using MicroCal LLC ITC software (MicroCal), fitting them to an independent binding model. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Excess heat capacity Cp(T) of the apo and holo form of LigBCen2 was measured using a DSC Q1000 microcalorimeter (Waters, New Castle, DE). Degassed samples containing 3 μm LigBCen2 with and without 1 mm CaCl2 in Tris buffer (pH 7.0) were heated at a 10 K/h scan rate. Cp(T) data were recorded, corrected for buffer base line, and normalized to the amount of the sample. The TA Universal Analysis software (Waters, New Castle, DE) was used for the data analysis and display. CD Spectrometry—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter under N2 atmosphere at room temperature (25 °C) in a 0.02- and 0.5-cm path length quartz cell for far- and near-UV CD spectra, respectively, with eight accumulations. Aliquots of calcium chloride solution were added to the protein solution and incubated for 5 min. All spectra were recorded in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7, containing 50 mm KCl. In thermal unfolding experiments, 2 μm LigBCen2 in the absence and presence of 1 mm CaCl2 was subjected to thermal unfolding, and data were collected at 1 °C/min increments from 25 to 70 °C recording the ellipticity at 215 nm, with 30-s temperature equilibrations, followed by 30-s data averaging. In order to measure the melting point, a first order derivative was applied to the results from the melting experiment. In all CD experiments, the background spectrum of Tris buffer (pH 7.0) without protein was subtracted from the protein spectra. The Stains-all binding assay was performed essentially as described earlier (32Caday C.G. Steiner R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5985-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sharma Y. Rao C.M. Rao S.C. Krishna A.G. Somasundaram T. Balasubramanian D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20923-20927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LigBCen2 (5 μm) was mixed with the dye solution (60–100 μm) in 2 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, containing 30% ethylene glycol, and incubated for 5 min, and CD spectra were recorded from 400–700 nm. For studying the interaction, aliquots of NTD of Fn were mixed to the LigBCen2-Stains-all complex in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and CD spectra recorded. Fluorescence Spectrometry—Fluorescence emission spectra were measured on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). All spectra were recorded in correct spectrum mode of the instrument with excitation and emission band passes of 5 nm each. The intrinsic Trp fluorescence of the protein was recorded by exciting the solution at 295 nm and measuring the emission in the 300–400 nm regions. For calcium or magnesium titration, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, or 1.0 mm of calcium chloride was mixed with 10 μm of LigBCen2 in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm KCl, and spectra were recorded after 3 min of incubation. ANS fluorescence was measured by adding ANS to a final concentration of 100 μm to the protein solution (18 μm) and incubated for 5 min, and spectra were recorded between 400 and 600 nm at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm. Fibronectin binding to LigBCen2 was assayed by measuring the change in Trp fluorescence upon the addition of aliquots of NTD of Fn in the presence of 100 μm CaCl2 or in the absence of calcium chloride (in the presence of 100 μm EGTA). The mixture was incubated for 5 min before recording the emission spectra at the excitation of 295 nm. In a calcium competition experiment, 20 μm Calcium Green™-1 was mixed with or without 30 μm LigBCen2, and 100 μl/well was dispensed into a microtiter plate and incubated with 0.046, 0.093, 0.187, 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, or 3 μm CaCl2 in Tris buffer, pH 7.0, for 5 min. Enhanced fluorescence due to binding of free calcium and Calcium Green™-1 was monitored at 528 nm with excitation at 485 nm using a Synergy™ HT multidetection microplate reader (Bio-TEK Instruments, Inc. Winooski, VT). The association constant, Ka, was deduced using a Scatchard plot, and rearrangement of the Chang-Prusoff equation was used to calculate the dissociation constant (KD) of LigBCen2 and calcium (34Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12294) Google Scholar). Kapp=KD(dye)(1+[LigBCen2]KD(LigBCen2))(Eq. 1) Kapp is the apparent dissociation constant measured in the presence of a concentration of LigBCen2 in Calcium Green™-1 solution with calcium; KD(dye) or KD(LigBCen2) is the KD of calcium with Calcium Green™-1 or LigBCen2, respectively. All spectra were recorded in the correct spectrum mode excitation and emission band passes of 5 nm each and corrected for volume changes before further analysis. All measurements were performed at 25 °C. Fibronectin Binding Assay by ELISA—To determine the binding of LigBCen2 to NTD of Fn in the presence and absence of Ca2+, serial concentrations of NTD or bovine serum albumin (negative reference and data not shown) were coated on microtiter plate wells and blocked subsequently as previously described (15Lin Y.P. Chang Y.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 10 nm in the absence of or 1 mm in the presence of CaCl2, GST-LigBCen2, or GST in 100 μl of Tris buffer (pH 7.0) was added onto microtiter plate wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. To detect the binding of GST-LigBCen2 or GST, rabbit anti-GST (1:200) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000) were used as primary and secondary antibody, respectively (15Lin Y.P. Chang Y.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After washing the plates three times with TBST, (0.05% Tween 20 in Tris buffer) 100 μl of 3, 3′, 5, 5′-tetramethylbenzidine (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to each well and incubated for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 0.5% hydrofluoric acid to each well. Each plate was read at 630 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bioteck EL-312; Bio-TEK Instruments). Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of three trials in triplicate samples. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences are indicated by an asterisk. Statistical Analysis—Each data point represents the mean S.E. of sample tested in triplicate. Data were analyzed by Student's t test, and statistically significant differences were claimed at p values of <0.05. Previously, Lig proteins, including LigA and LigB, have been shown to bind to extracellular matrix (14Choy H.A. Kelley M.M. Chen T.L. Moller A.K. Matsunaga J. Haake D.A. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 2441-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 15Lin Y.P. Chang Y.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Lin Y.P. Chang Y.F. J. Vet. Sci. 2008; 9: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). the central region of LigB, annotated as LigBCen2 (Fig. 1A) was selected for further functional studies (15Lin Y.P. Chang Y.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The sequence was selected from amino acids 1014–1165 of LigB, as seen in Fig. 1B. Interestingly, this region contains the BIg domain and the nonrepeat region of 46 amino acids (15Lin Y.P. Chang Y.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Proteins that contain the BIg domain are found in a variety of bacterial and phage surface proteins, such as intimins or invasins, which are bacterial cell adhesion molecules that mediate intimate bacterial host-cell interaction (35Isberg R.R. Voorhis D.L. Falkow S. Cell. 1987; 50: 769-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 36Jerse A.E. Yu J. Tall B.D. Kaper J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7839-7843Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). E. coli intimin contains three domains (two immunoglobulin-like domains and a C-type lectin-like module), implying that carbohydrate recognition may be important in intimin-mediated cell adhesion. However, the exact functions of these proteins, barring some preliminary studies on fibronectin interactions, are not known (15Lin Y.P. Chang Y.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, nothing is known about the function of Lig proteins except that they are thought to play a role in virulence or pathogenesis. We were interested in identifying the functions of these important proteins. Structurally, Lig proteins belong to the bacterial immunoglobulin fold or BIg fold. In one of the earlier studies, the structural and functional similarities between various proteins of the Greek key/immunoglobulin fold were assessed (31Goode D. Crabbe M.J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 19: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Among the proteins selected for functional prediction, lens βγ-crystallins and immunoglobulin functions were chosen. Since both families of proteins possess the Greek key type fold (31Goode D. Crabbe M.J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 19: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), it prompted us to look for the function of Lig proteins in the context of lens βγ-crystallins. The exact function of lens βγ-crystallins is not known. However, we have shown earlier that βγ-crystallins belong to a different superfamily of low affinity Ca2+-binding proteins (37Jobby M.K. Sharma Y. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 4135-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 38Rajini B. Graham C. Wistow G. Sharma Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4552-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on the fold similarities, we predicted that these Lig proteins might bind Ca2+. Therefore, we assessed Ca2+ binding to LigBCen2 by a number of methods as described below. Since there is no known motif in LigBCen2 for Ca2+ binding, it was necessary to probe Ca2+ binding by a number of methods to examine the specificity of Ca2+ binding. First, we probed Ca2+ binding to LigBCen2 by ICP-OES. LigBCen2 in the presence or absence (in the presence of EGTA) of calcium chloride were applied to ICP-OES. As shown in Table 1, calcium was present only in calcium chloride-treated LigBCen2 and not in untreated or EGTA-treated LigB-Cen2. The results indicate that Ca2+ binds to LigBCen2, since there was no Ca2+ binding to EGTA-treated or untreated LigBCen2. To further confirm the Ca2+ binding activity revealed by ICP-OES, Ca2+ binding to LigBCen2 was assessed by EDS. As seen in Fig. 2, A and B, a prominent calcium signal was seen in Ca2+-bound LigBCen2 and not in the apo form of LigBCen2.TABLE 1The concentration of the metal ions detected by ICP-optical emissionCalciumManganeseCobaltCopperCadmiumMagnesiumZincμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlLigBCen2 with Ca2+4.813—a—, concentration below 0.1 μg/ml.—————LigBCen2 with EGTA———————LigBCen2———————a —, concentration below 0.1 μg/ml. Open table in a new tab We also performed 45Ca binding to LigBCen2 using a well known method of overlay (39Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Seen as a dark spot on the membrane, radioactive calcium 45Ca binds to LigB-Cen2, thereby confirming the specificity of Ca2+ binding to the protein (data not shown). Further, the molecular mass of the holo form of LigBCen2 is higher (18,292 Da), as indicated by MALDI-TOF peaks, than that of the apo form of LigBCen2 (18,131 Da), further indicating that Ca2+ binds to LigBCen2 (Fig. 2C). Since there was a 161-Da difference in the molecular mass between holo and apo forms, it is likely that at least four Ca2+ molecules were bound to LigBCen2. The above results of mass spectroscopy and 45Ca binding experiments demonstrate that LigBCen2 is a Ca2+-binding protein. We next assessed the affinity and stoichiometry of the Ca2+"
https://openalex.org/W2084889323,"We recently reported an artificially split intein based on the Ssp DnaB mini-intein that consists of a synthetic N-terminal intein fragment (IntN) and a recombinant C-terminal part (IntC), which are 11 and 143 amino acids in length, respectively. This intein holds great promise for the preparation of semi-synthetic proteins by protein trans-splicing. In this work we synthesized a set of IntN peptide variants to investigate their structure-function relationship with regard to fragment association and promotion of protein trans-splicing. A further truncation of the IntN sequence below 11 amino acids resulted in loss of activity, whereas C-terminal extensions were tolerated. Alanine scanning analysis identified three essential hydrophobic residues, whereas substitutions at other positions were tolerated. We developed assays to monitor association of IntN with an IntC mutant blocked in protein splicing by native PAGE and fluorescence anisotropy. The kinetic parameters of intein complex formation were Kd = 1.1 μm, kon = 16.8 m–1 s–1, and koff = 1.8 × 10–5 s–1 for the native IntN11 sequence. Intriguingly, a G(–1)A substitution, previously known to significantly impair protein splicing, was revealed to result in thiazoline ring formation involving the catalytic Cys-1, likely by aberrant dehydration of a oxythiazolidine intermediate. This finding provides experimental evidence for the postulated intermediate during the initial N/S acyl shift and underlines the delicate spatial and temporal alignment required in the intein active site to prevent side reactions of the protein-splicing pathway.

Protein splicing is a process in which an internal protein segment, the intein, excises itself out of a precursor protein (1Noren C.J. Wang J. Perler F.B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 450-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 3Evans Jr., T.C. Xu M.Q. Chem.

This remarkable post-translational protein backbone rearrangement is catalyzed by the intein in a spontaneous, autocatalytic reaction without the need of any additional factors or energy sources. Protein splicing is initiated by the attack of the nucleophilic side chain of a Cys or Ser residue at the first position of the intein on its upstream peptide bond to generate a thioester or oxoester intermediate, respectively. In the second step of the pathway, the ExN acyl group is transferred by a trans(thio)esterification on the side chain of a Cys, Ser, or Thr at the first position of the ExC. The side chain amide group of an Asn residue at the ultimate position of the intein then attacks its own carbonyl group to form a succinimide and thereby to cleave the peptide bond between the intein and the ExC. In the final reaction, the thio- or oxoester between the liberated ExN-ExC quickly rearranges to the thermodynamically more stable peptide bond. This canonical mechanism of protein splicing as well as deviations from it found in certain inteins have been extensively reviewed (1Noren C.J. Wang J. Perler F.B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 450-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 3Evans Jr., T.C. Xu M.Q. Chem.

Inteins are useful as self-cleavable tags for protein purification strategies (5Chong S. Mersha F.B. Comb D.G. Scott M.E. Landry D. Vence L.M. Perler F.B. Benner J. Kucera R.B. Hirvonen C.A. Pelletier J.J. Paulus H. Xu M.Q. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). They also have found many applications in the fields of protein chemistry and protein semi-synthesis, as they provide a route to obtain recombinant protein thioesters and proteins with an N-terminal cysteine residue important for chemical ligation reactions like native chemical ligation (NCL) and expressed protein ligation (6Evans Jr., T.C.

These methods take advantage of the protein ester intermediates generated during protein splicing, which can be cleaved by thiolysis or hydrolysis, and the finding that inteins can in principle be inserted into a heterologous protein context, i.e. they are quite tolerant toward foreign extein sequences (5Chong S.

This reaction is performed by split inteins, which are found in a few native examples (10Iwai H. Zuger S. Jin J. Tam P.H.

Protein trans-splicing enables the post-translational linkage of proteins or polypeptides originating from two separate molecules. The position in a loop region that is amenable to split the intein domain was indicated by the insertion of a homing endonuclease domain in many native maxi-inteins at this position. Typically, the corresponding N- and C-terminal intein fragments (IntN and IntC) are about 100–150 and 36–50 amino acids (aa) in size. We have shown recently that an IntN fragment of 11 aa and an IntC fragment of 143 aa of the Ssp DnaB mini intein reconstitute spontaneously to the active intein in vitro (15Ludwig C. Pfeiff M. Linne U. Mootz H.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 5218-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This finding has enabled the preparation of an ExN-IntN polypeptide by chemical peptide synthesis. Protein trans-splicing with a recombinantly produced IntC-ExC fusion protein can then be used to covalently link a synthetic part, e.g. a spectroscopic probe, post-translational modification, or unnatural amino acid, to the N-terminal end of a protein of interest (see Fig. 1) (15Ludwig C. Pfeiff M. Linne U. Mootz H.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 5218-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This approach is, thus, a chemo-enzymatic alternative to chemical ligation strategies to prepare semi-synthetic proteins. It bears in addition the potential for cellular applications due to the specificity mediated by the intein fragment.

In this work we have further analyzed the interaction between the synthetic IntN and the corresponding IntC fragment of the Ssp DnaB intein. We determined sequence requirements within the IntN part by minimization of the peptide length and by alanine scanning analysis. Using fluorescence anisotropy measurements, the dissociation constants between the IntN and IntC fragments were calculated. These results lay the foundation for a further exploration of this intein, for example for the preparation of semi-synthetic proteins or for detailed investigations of the protein splicing mechanism. Finally and surprisingly, using one of the peptide variants and a mutant of IntC that is blocked for protein splicing, we have observed the conversion of the catalytic Cys-1 residue and the upstream carbonyl group to a thiazoline ring, which was likely formed by water elimination of an oxythiazolidine anion. The initial N/S acyl shift is believed to proceed through this intermediate (2Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 20Mizutani R. Nogami S. Kawasaki M. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Satow Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our results represent the first experimental evidence for the occurrence of the postulated 5-membered cyclic intermediate. The aberrant side-reaction to the thiazoline underlines once more the intricate spatial and temporal fine-tuning in the intein active site required to accomplish the correct protein splicing reaction. General Techniques and Materials—Unless otherwise specified, standard protocols were used. Kanamycin was used at 50 μg/ml concentration. Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Qiagen-Operon. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Reagents were purchased from Acros, Sigma-Aldrich, Novabiochem, or Roth, and restriction enzymes and markers were obtained from Fermentas. All reactions and assays were performed at least in duplicate. Construction of Expression Plasmids—For a detailed description of construction of expression plasmid pCL20 for protein 1, see Ludwig et al. (15Ludwig C. Pfeiff M. Linne U. Mootz H.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 5218-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Plasmids pMP06 encoding construct 2 (N154A, S+1A) as well as pPJ03 encoding construct 3 (N154A, S+1A, H73A) were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of pCL20 following the QuikChange protocol from Stratagene. Expression and Purification of Proteins—For protein expression, Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was transformed with the respective plasmids. Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic at 37 °C to absorbance (600 nm) = 0.6–0.8. Before the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm) the temperature was lowered to 30 °C. After 3–5 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid buffer A (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and lysed by two passages through a high pressure homogenizer (Avestin EmulsiFlex C5). All proteins carried a C-terminal His6 tag and remained, after cell lysis and centrifugation at 30,000 × g, in the soluble fraction. An affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) superflow material (Qiagen) was performed, and proteins were eluted with Ni2+-NTA buffer B (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). For a subsequent anion exchange (AE) chromatography, the buffer was changed to AE-buffer A (20 mm Tris, 2 mm DTT, pH 8.0) by dialysis. Protein solutions were applied onto a HiTrap Q anion-exchange column (1 ml bed volume, Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with AE-buffer B (20 mm Tris, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Pooled fractions were dialyzed against assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) containing also 20% glycerin (to increase protein stability at 30 °C for fluorescence anisotropy measurements), shock-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the calculated molecular extinction coefficients at 280 nm. Peptide Synthesis—Solid phase peptide synthesis was performed partially manually and partially using a Syro XP peptide synthesizer (Multisyntech) on a Wang-resin according to standard protocols based on the Fmoc protecting group strategy and with 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) as the activation reagent. The Cys building block was coupled manually as pentafluorophenyl ester without the addition of base. 5,6-Carboxyfluorescein was coupled to the N-terminal amino group of the peptide applying a coupling time of at least 8 h. Deprotection/cleavage with reagent K (trifluoroacetic acid:H2O:thioanisole:ethanedithiol:phenol = 85:5:5:2.5:2.5) was carried out for 3 h. Peptides were purified by preparative HPLC (Varian) under acidic conditions (buffer A, H2O + 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); buffer B, acetonitrile + 0.05% TFA) with a Microsorb 300-5 C18 column (Varian) and confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. All peptides were of >95% purity as monitored by analytical HPLC (Agilent 1100 series) using an Eclipse XDB-C18 3.5 μm column (Agilent). Peptide concentrations were determined photometrically at pH 9.0 and 492 nm using the molar extinction coefficient of carboxyfluorescein of ϵ492 = 65000 m–1cm–1. Analysis of the Splicing Reaction by SDS-PAGE—Splicing reactions were basically performed as previously described (15Ludwig C. Pfeiff M. Linne U. Mootz H.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 5218-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In brief, peptide and protein were mixed at indicated concentrations in assay buffer and incubated at 25 °C. At various time points aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed, quenched by the addition of 4× SDS loading buffer (containing 8% SDS and 20% β-mercaptoethanol), and boiled before applying onto an SDS gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and relative intensities of protein bands were densitometrically determined using the program Scion Image. For UV illumination, the SDS gels were photographed under UV light before staining. For the kinetic investigation of pep3 with 1 (42 μm), pseudo first-order reaction conditions were established with a 5-, 7.5-, and 10-fold excess of peptide. The second-order rate constants ksplicing and kC-cleavage were determined from a plot of k′ (first-order rate constant) versus protein concentration by linear regression (slope of the fit). Analysis of the Complex Formation by Native and SDS-PAGE—These assays with constructs 2 or 3 were carried out similarly to the protein splicing assays. However, for analysis on native PAGE gels, the aliquots of the reaction mixtures were quenched with sample buffer free of SDS (5% final concentration of β-mercaptoethanol). Protein samples were not boiled before loading on the gel. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—All peptide synthesis products as well as splicing reaction mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS measurements using an Autoflex 2 (Bruker Daltonics) in the positive ion detection mode. Calibration of peptides was performed using the Peptide Standard I (Bruker Daltonics), whereas proteins were calibrated with Protein Calibration Standard I (Bruker Daltonics). Fluorescence Anisotropy Spectroscopy—Fluorescence anisotropy was measured with a SafireII spectrofluorometer (Tecan) using 384-well plates (OptiPlate-384 F, PerkinElmer Life Sciences flat-bottom-black) and a final reaction volume of 50 μl per well. Measurements were taken every 60 s at 30 °C applying an excitation wavelength of 470 nm and an emission wavelength of 542 nm. To prevent solvent evaporation, all reaction wells were sealed with a self-adhesive transparent plastic foil (Biacore) directly after mixing the reaction components and before starting the measurement. Control experiments using non-binding pep6 as well as non-binding control proteins (thioredoxin (Trx) and bovine serum albumin) confirmed that differences in total fluorescence intensity of the free and bound peptide were negligible (data not shown). The background fluorescence anisotropy of a blank sample (1 μm peptide in assay buffer) was subtracted from final fluorescence anisotropy values. From a set of experiments measured for each peptide with various protein concentrations, the Kd was calculated by plotting the maximal fluorescence anisotropy value against the protein concentration. These data could be fitted using Equation 1 (21Wilkinson K.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 15-32PubMed Google Scholar), A=A0+(Amax-A0)·([P]0+[Pep]0+Kd)-([P]0+[Pep]0+Kd)2-4[P]0-[Pep]02[Pep]0(Eq. 1) where A = fluorescence anisotropy, A0 = anisotropy of the free peptide, Amax = maximal saturated anisotropy, [P]0 = protein concentration at time point 0 s, and [Pep]0 = peptide concentration at time point 0 s (= 1 μm). The k′on values were determined by fitting the kinetic data obtained as described above from those assays with a sufficient excess of 3 (5 μm and more) to a first-order rate equation. From plotting k′on versus the protein concentration, the second-order rate constant kon (slope) was determined by linear regression. Minimizing the Synthetic IntN Fragment of the Semi-synthetic Intein—Our semi-synthetic split intein consists of a recombinantly expressed IntC and a synthetically prepared IntN fragment, which are derived from the Ssp DnaB mini-intein (15Ludwig C. Pfeiff M. Linne U. Mootz H.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 5218-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The IntC fragment in protein construct 1 corresponds to aa 12–154 of the DnaB mini-intein sequence. C-terminal-fused Trx serves as a model ExC sequence (see Fig. 1). The synthetic peptide comprises an ExN sequence of 5 aa plus a 5,6-carboxyfluorescein moiety (Fl) as a fluorophore to allow for facile detection followed by IntN comprising aa 1–11. In our first report of this system (15Ludwig C. Pfeiff M. Linne U. Mootz H.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 5218-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), two extra residues (Ser-Arg) were added to the C terminus of this peptide (pep1; see Table 1 for all peptides used in this study) to ensure comparability with an initially investigated recombinant IntN construct, in which they were present for cloning reasons. The serine in fact corresponds to aa 12 in the native sequence of the DnaB intein, whereas the arginine is unrelated.TABLE 1Peptides used in this studyPeptideShort descriptionSequence (NH2-ExN-IntN-COOH)MasskonaErrors represent the given S.E. calculated from the linear correlation of k′on and protein concentration.KdbErrors represent the standard deviation of at least two measurements.Calculated koffDam-1s-1μm10-5s-1pep1IntN13Fl-SEFSG-CISGDSLISLASR2185.924.8 ± 0.70.7 ± 0.11.7pep2IntN12Fl-KKESG-CISGDSLISLAS2051.919.5 ± 0.50.9 ± 0.011.8pep3IntN11 (reference)Fl-KKESG-CISGDSLISLA1964.916.8 ± 1.01.1 ± 0.21.8pep4IntN10Fl-KKESG-CISGDSLISL1893.80.4 ± 0.129.1 ± 4.31.2pep5IntN9Fl-KKESG-CISGDSLIS1780.8pep6IntN5Fl-KKESG-CISGD1380.5pep7C1AFl-KKESG-AISGDSLISLA1932.911.1 ± 1.21.2 ± 0.31.3pep8I2AFl-KKESG-CASGDSLISLA1922.82.5 ± 0.212.3 ± 4.13.1pep9S3AFl-KKESG-CIAGDSLISLA1948.916.7 ± 2.20.9 ± 0.21.5pep10G4AFl-KKESG-CISADSLISLA1978.99.5 ± 0.61.9 ± 1.11.8pep11D5AFl-KKESG-CISGASLISLA1920.94.3 ± 0.63.7 ± 1.11.6pep12S6AFl-KKESG-CISGDALISLA1948.923.3 ± 1.81.0 ± 0.62.3pep13L7AFl-KKESG-CISGDSAISLA1922.82.2 ± 0.36.1 ± 1.51.3pep14I8AFl-KKESG-CISGDSLASLA1922.80.7 ± 0.0418.4 ± 4.61.3pep15S9AFl-KKESG-CISGDSLIALA1948.913.4 ± 0.81.1 ± 0.031.5pep16L10AFl-KKESG-CISGDSLISAA1922.90.6 ± 0.0626.9 ± 2.41.6pep17G(-1)AFl-KKESA-CISGDSLISLA1978.922.0 ± 0.72.3 ± 0.15.1a Errors represent the given S.E. calculated from the linear correlation of k′on and protein concentration.b Errors represent the standard deviation of at least two measurements. Open table in a new tab In a first series of experiments we aimed to determine the true minimal peptide sequence of the IntN fragment. To this end, peptides pep2 to pep6 (see Table 1) were synthesized. Each peptide was then incubated with construct 1 at equimolar concentrations (50 μm each), and reaction progress was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Protein trans-splicing led to the semi-synthetic product 5 (Fl-(5 aa)-Trx, see Fig. 1). In addition, thioredoxin (10) itself is generated as a byproduct through C-terminal cleavage. Fig. 2, lane 4, shows that pep3, lacking both extra C-terminal residues, exhibited the same splice activity as the longer variants pep1 (lane 2) and pep2 (lane 3). Protein splicing yields of up to 70% with about 20% of C-terminal cleavage were obtained. Thus, extra residues appended to the IntN sequence were not important for activity but could be tolerated without loss of activity. This also held true for various other aa at these positions (data not shown). A further C-terminal truncation of the peptide sequence in pep4 (IntN10) (Fig. 2, lane 5) resulted in a complete loss of protein trans-splicing activity; however, C-terminal cleavage was still observed. Finally, the shorter IntN9 as well as the IntN5 fragments in pep5 (lane 6) and pep6 (lane 7) were completely inactive. Attempts to restore activity in these cases with a correspondingly extended recombinant IntC-(6–154) counterpart were not successful (data not shown). In conclusion, an IntN fragment of 11 aa, as in pep3, which is in the following referred to as the reference peptide, represents the minimal sequence requirement for an intein active in protein trans-splicing. A kinetic investigation of the reaction between pep3 and construct 1 was performed based on the densitometric analysis of protein band intensities using SDS-PAGE (see Fig. S1). By using a 10-fold excess of pep3 over construct 1, we assumed pseudo first-order conditions and calculated a rate constant of k′splicing = 4.4 × 10–4 s–1 and k′C-cleavage = 0.9 × 10–4 s–1. From the used peptide excesses of 5-, 7.5- and 10-fold (data not shown), we could observe a linear concentration dependence of the rate constants. From these data the second-order rate constants ksplicing = 0.8 ± 0.1 m–1s–1 and kC-cleavage = 0.1 ± 0.07 m–1s–1 were determined. Functional Analysis of Alanine Scanning Variants of the IntN11 Fragment—To evaluate the impact of each residue within the IntN11 segment for splicing activity, we performed an alanine scanning analysis. Additionally, the first aa of the ExN sequence, Gly(–1), which is the natively occurring neighboring residue, was replaced with alanine. Thus, peptides pep7 to pep17 (Table 1) were synthesized and assayed as described above. The analysis of the reaction mixtures by SDS-PAGE is shown in Fig. 3. As expected, replacement of the catalytic Cys-1 with alanine in pep7 (lane 3) led to a complete loss of splicing activity, whereas C-terminal cleavage was not affected. The remaining peptides could roughly be categorized into four groups according to their activity profile. Group A comprises the reference peptide pep3 (lane 2) as well as all peptides with sequence variations that only slightly affected the splicing reaction. This group included all peptides with serine to alanine substitutions, i.e. pep9, pep12, and pep15. The second group B represents all peptides with no detectable intein activity, neither protein splicing nor C-terminal cleavage. Noticeably, in all these cases a large hydrophobic amino acid was replaced (pep8, pep14, and pep16). Inspection of the crystal structure of the DnaB intein reveals that these three residues are part of the hydrophobic core of the protein (22Ding Y. Xu M.Q. Ghosh I. Chen X. Ferrandon S. Lesage G. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39133-39142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Group C are peptides that showed a considerable reduction in splicing activity and an increased C-terminal cleavage activity. In these cases, Gly-4, Asp-5, or Leu-7 were changed to alanine (pep10, pep11, and pep13). Finally, pep17 containing the G(–1)A substitution represents group D, because it exhibited a different behavior with a significant, but not complete, reduction of splicing activity and a partial reduction in the formation of the C-terminal cleavage product. This observation is in agreement with a previous report in which the same G(–1)A mutation almost completely blocked splicing in the context of the Ssp DnaB mini-intein (23Mathys S. Evans T.C. Chute I.C. Wu H. Chong S. Benner J. Liu X.Q. Xu M.Q. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 231: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Analysis of Intein Complex Formation by Native and SDS-PAGE—To monitor complex formation between the IntN and IntC fragments and to discern it from the subsequent splicing reaction, two mutant IntC-Trx proteins were constructed that are blocked in protein splicing but not in fragment association. Construct 2 has two mutations of essential catalytic residues (N154A and S+1A), which block the transesterification of the ExN as well as the peptide bond-breaking step at the C-terminal splice junction. However, this construct is still active in triggering the initial N/S acyl shift to form the ExN thioester (see Fig. 1). The second mutant, construct 3, therefore included an additional mutation (H73A), which also blocks the N/S acyl shift at the N-terminal splice junction (22Ding Y. Xu M.Q. Ghosh I. Chen X.

We discovered a high stability of the noncovalent complexes between IntN and the IntC mutant constructs and, therefore, used native PAGE gels to investigate intein fragment association. As shown in lane 13 of Fig. 4A (panel I), construct 2 in the absence of an IntN peptide migrates as a discrete band. Upon preincubation with the pep3 (Fig. 4A, lane 12), the protein exhibited higher electrophoretic mobility, suggesting that the formed IntN-IntC complex is more compact than the IntC protein alone. A similar complex formation indicated by a band shift was observed for most other peptides, except for those of group B (pep8, pep14, and pep16) and pep7 (C1A). Pep11 (D5A) induced only a minor shift, likely because it is the only peptide with a different charge. A striking observation was made when the native gel was illuminated under UV light to visualize the intein complexes by virtue of the fluorophore attached to the peptides (Fig. 4A, panel II). In all cases, except for pep17 (G(–1)A), the fluorescence si"

In previous studies, depletion of Cdc7 by small interfering RNA was shown to induce an abortive S phase that led to the cell cycle arrest in normal human fibroblasts and apoptotic cell death in various cancer cells. Here we report that stress-activated p38 MAP kinase was activated and responsible for apoptotic cell death in Cdc7-depleted HeLa cells. The activation of p38 MAP kinase in the Cdc7-depleted cells was shown to depend on ATR, a major sensor kinase for checkpoint or DNA damage responses. Only the p38 MAP kinase, and not the other stress-activated kinases such as JNK or ERK, was activated, and both caspase 8 and caspase 9 were activated for the induction of apoptosis. Activation of apoptosis in Cdc7-depleted cells was completely abolished in cells treated with small interfering RNA or an inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase, suggesting that p38 MAP kinase activation was responsible for apoptotic cell death. Taken together, we suggest that the ATR-dependent activation of the p38 MAP kinase is a major signaling pathway that induces apoptotic cell death after depletion of Cdc7 in cancer cells. Cdc7 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays essential roles in the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication and checkpoint response.

Taken together, we suggest that the ATR-dependent activation of the p38 MAP kinase is a major signaling pathway that induces apoptotic cell death after depletion of Cdc7 in cancer cells. Cdc7 is an evolutionally conserved serine/threonine kinase that is essential for the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 2Sclafani R.A. Holzen T.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 237-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Cdc7 kinase activity is required for the activation of individual replication origins throughout S phase presumably by phosphorylating components of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) such as the Mcm proteins. Although the Cdc7 protein level is constant during the cell cycle, its kinase activity fluctuates during this period because of its binding to the regulatory subunit, Dbf4, whose level peaks at S phase (3Dowell S.J. Romanowski P. Diffley J.F. Science. 1994; 265: 1243-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Jiang W. McDonald D. Hope T.J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5703-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Whereas only one regulatory subunit has been identified in yeast systems, mammals and Xenopus contain an additional regulatory subunit, Drf1 (5Silva T. Bradley R.H. Gao Y. Coue M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11569-11576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Both Dbf4 and Drf1 appear to be important for DNA replication (3Dowell S.J. Romanowski P. Diffley J.F.

Chem. 2006; 281: 11569-11576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There are several reports suggesting that Cdc7 kinase also plays an important role in the checkpoint response to DNA damage or replication stress. The Cdc7 kinase complex appears to be a direct target of Rad53/Cds1, yeast homologues of mammalian Chk2 kinase, which inhibits DNA replication during checkpoint responses (6Dohrmann P.R. Oshiro G. Tecklenburg M. Sclafani R.A. Genetics. 1999; 151: 965-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Weinreich M. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5334-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA, which is generated by various genotoxic stresses, also targets the Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase via the activation of ATR, resulting in the inhibition of DNA synthesis in the Xenopus system (8Costanzo V. Shechter D. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Gottesman M. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, contradictory reports suggest that the Cdc7 kinase is either a target of the Chk1 pathway or an activator of the Chk1 kinase (9Heffernan T.P. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Heinloth A.N.

When cells are subjected to various kinds of genotoxic stress, such as DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication, complex checkpoint pathways are activated that arrest the cell cycle and facilitate DNA repair. ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 are major factors that control checkpoint responses in mammalian cells. ATM is a protein kinase that is activated primarily by double-strand breaks (DSBs), whereas ATR is a chromatin-binding protein kinase that is activated by single-stranded DNA generated by factors that block replication and/or lead to the collapse of replication forks. The ATM/ATR kinases phosphorylate and activate Chk1/Chk2 kinases, which, in turn, activate various proteins involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and cell survival (2Sclafani R.A. Holzen T.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 237-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 11Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor protein, p53 is a major downstream effector of these kinase pathways (11Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar, 13Vousden K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 14Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In normal cells the activation of p53 results in cell cycle arrest primarily by up-regulating the expression of p21. However, when DNA damage is extensive, p53 induces cell death by activating intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic pathways (15Fridman J.S. Lowe S.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9030-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Another important player in the cellular response to genotoxic stress is the p38 MAP kinase (p38 MAPK). 2The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasesiRNAsmall interfering RNApre-RCpre-replicative complexDSBsdouble-strand breaksMK2MAPK-activated protein kinase 2JNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinasecisplatincis-diaminedichloro-platinum IIPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Originally, p38 MAPK was identified as a stress-activated protein kinase that responded to various cellular stimuli including cytokines, UV irradiation, heat/osmotic shock, and oxidative stress (16Cuenda A. Rousseau S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1358-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The activity of p38 MAPK was reported to play an important role in G2/M checkpoint response after UV irradiation (17Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2) appears to be the downstream effector kinase of p38 MAPK for the checkpoint response (18Manke I.A. Nguyen A. Lim D. Stewart M.Q. Elia A.E. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The sustained activation of p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is also responsible for cisplatin (cis-diaminedichloro-platinum II)-induced apoptosis by activating the death receptor pathway for apoptosis (19Roos W.P.

Recently, the down-regulation of Cdc7 kinase activity in mammalian cells was reported to induce apoptotic cell death in various cell lines. The inactivation of Cdc7 kinase in mouse ES cells resulted in cell cycle arrest at the S phase, and eventually induced p53-dependent cell death (21Kim J.M. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Saito I. Katsuki M. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The depletion of Cdc7 kinase by transfecting small interfering (si) RNAs caused cell cycle arrest at S phase in normal human fibroblast cells, but led to the apoptotic cell death in various cancer cell lines (22Montagnoli A.

Because normal and cancer cells show different responses following depletion of Cdc7 kinase, Cdc7 appears to be an attractive target for cancer drug therapies. In normal human fibroblast cells, the tumor suppressor protein, p53 appears to play an important role leading to cell cycle arrest after Cdc7 depletion (22Montagnoli A. Tenca P. Sola F. Carpani D. Brotherton D. Albanese C. Santocanale C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7110-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms or pathways that induce apoptosis in Cdc7 depleted cancer cells are currently unknown. In this study, we examined the checkpoint and apoptotic pathways that were affected by the depletion of Cdc7 kinase in HeLa cells. Our findings indicate that the depletion of Cdc7 activated the p38 MAPK in an ATR-dependent manner and led to the apoptotic cell death of HeLa cells. Based on these results, we propose that the ATR-dependent activation of p38 MAPK is a major signaling pathway that induces apoptotic cell death after replication stress in cancer cells. Cell Culture and Reagents—HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma), U2OS (human osteosarcoma), and HT-29 (human colon adenocarcinoma) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HCT116 (human colon cancer) p53+/+ or p53–/– and SNU-C2A (human colorectal adenocarcinoma) were cultured in RPMI medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Welgene Inc (Seoul, Korea). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The reagents staurosporine, caffeine, cisplatin, nocodazole, and SB202190 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Analysis of Cell Cycle and Apoptosis—For cell cycle analysis, cells were transfected with siRNAs and further incubated for 48∼72 h. Cells were collected after treatment with trypsin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with 70% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing RNase A (2 μg/ml), were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide for 10 min at 37 °C, samples were analyzed with a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Analysis of apoptosis was carried out with the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation and Transfection of siRNAs—The sense strand sequences of individual siRNAs used in this study were as follows: CDC7, 5′-AAGCUCAGCAGGAAAGGUGTT-3′; CDC7 control, 5′-AAGCUAAGAAGAAAAGGUGTT-3′; ATR, 5′-CCUCCGUGAUGUUGCUUGA-3′; p38-α, 5′-AAGGCCCAUACCUUCUGGUUG-3′, and MK2, 5′-UGACCAUCACCGAGUUUAU-3′. All chemically synthesized siRNAs were from Samchully Pharm (Daejon, Korea). Transfections of siRNAs (120 nm) were performed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting, proteins were extracted with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. Approximately 30 μg of protein from each lysate was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays (BioRad). The antibodies against phospho-ATM (Ser-1981), phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182), phospho-Chk1 (Ser-317), phospho-Chk2 (Thr-68), phospho-MK2 (Thr-334), phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), phospho-Rb (Ser-807/811), phosphor-MKK3/6 (Ser-189/207), phosphor-MKK4 (Ser-257/Thr-261), p38, cleaved caspase3, cleaved caspase 8, cleaved caspase 9, PARP, JNK, and cyclin A were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against Cdc7, ATR, Chk1, and Chk2 were purchased from Abcam, and antibodies against actin, cyclin E, Cdc25A, and Rb were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody against cyclin B1 was purchased from Calbiochem. Cdc7 Depletion Does Not Elicit the Canonical Replication or DNA Damage Checkpoint Pathways, but Leads to the Apoptotic Cell Death of HeLa Cells—To investigate the cellular responses to the depletion of Cdc7 kinase, we repressed the expression of Cdc7 in HeLa cells using siRNA. SiRNA transfection efficiently reduced the expression of the Cdc7 kinase. As shown in Fig. 1A, the level of remaining Cdc7 was below detection 2 days following transfection. Because Cdc7 plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication, we expected Cdc7-depleted cells to be arrested at the G1/S or S phase of the cell cycle. However, flow cytometry analysis did not show significant accumulation of G1 or S phase cells after Cdc7 depletion but instead revealed a significant increase of sub-G1 cells (20% in this particular experiment) (Fig. 1A). The products of apoptosis, such as the cleaved forms of caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), were detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A, right panel). Induction of apoptosis was also confirmed by annexin V staining of Cdc7-depleted cells (Fig. 1B). In general, these cells had an abnormal morphology and most eventually died after postincubation for 3–4 days (data not presented). To precisely examine the effect of Cdc7 depletion on cell cycle progression, we synchronized the Cdc7-depleted cells at the G2/M phase with nocodazole, and then analyzed the progression of the cell cycle and induction of apoptosis after removal of nocodazole (Fig. 1C). Although there was some delay in the progression of the cell cycle from G2/M to G1 in Cdc7-depleted cells, G1 cells started to appear 6 h after removal of nocodazole, and a significant subset of cells (32%) were in the G1 phase after 12 h. These findings suggested that progression of the cell cycle from G2/M to G1 was not defective in the Cdc7-depleted cells. When cells were incubated further, however, cells containing 4N DNA did not re-appear, while the number of cells in the G1 phase decreased and those in the S phase increased. Instead of 4N DNA cells, there was a significant increase of sub-G1 cells, suggesting that cells entering the S phase in the absence of Cdc7 rapidly suffered apoptotic cell death. These results also indicated that a G1/S transition occurred even in the absence of Cdc7 kinase, which is known to be essential for the initiation of DNA replication. The lack of cell cycle arrest around the G1/S phase was further confirmed by Western blot analyses of the proteins involved in cell cycle progression including RB, cyclins, and Cdc25A. As shown in Fig. 1D, the levels of cyclin E, cyclin A, and cyclin B were not changed, and the degradation of Cdc25A or RB phosphorylation were not affected by the depletion of the Cdc7 kinase. Because Cdc7 depletion did not lead to the accumulation of cells at the G1/S boundary, we examined whether the Chk1/Chk2-dependent checkpoint pathways were activated under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 1D, depletion of Cdc7 kinase did not activate these checkpoint kinases, while hydroxyurea, which inhibits DNA replication by depleting dNTP pools, led to the phosphorylation and activation of ATM, Chk1, and Chk2. These results suggest that the failure of cell cycle arrest around the G1/S phase after Cdc7 depletion is due to a lack of Chk1/Chk2 activation and that Cdc7 might also be required for the activation of the checkpoint pathway. A Stress-activated Protein Kinase, p38 MAPK, Is Activated by Depletion of Cdc7 in HeLa Cells—We examined whether the depletion of Cdc7 induced apoptosis in various cancer cell lines. For this purpose, the activation of caspase 3 and PARP (Fig. 2A), as well as the generation of a sub-G1 cell populations (Fig. 2B), were examined after Cdc7 depletion in several p53-positive (HCT 116, U2OS, HT-29, SNU-C2A) and p53-negative (HCT116 E6) cancer cells. Apoptosis was induced in all tested cell lines after Cdc7 depletion although some differences in the level of activation were noted. These results suggest that apoptotic cell death is a general response found in most cancer cells after depletion of Cdc7. We also concluded that the loss of p53 was not essential for this effect because there was no correlation between the status of p53 and the level of apoptosis. We then searched for the pathway that was responsible for the induction of apoptosis in Cdc7-depleted cancer cells. Although the tumor suppressor, p53, generally plays an important role in the induction of apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress, the data shown in Fig. 2 suggest that this protein is not involved in the apoptotic cell death of Cdc7-depleted cancer cells. Another possible candidate is p38 MAPK, which has been shown to play roles in the checkpoint response and apoptosis in response to a variety of genotoxic stresses (16Cuenda A. Rousseau S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1358-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Indeed, the activation of p38 MAPK was detected after Cdc7 depletion in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). Cdc7 depletion resulted in the increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which activated p38 MAPK, leading to the elevated phosphorylation of MK2, a major downstream target of p38 MAPK in the checkpoint response. Because p38 MAPK is a family member of the stress-activated protein kinases, which are activated under a variety of stress conditions, we examined whether other MAP kinase members were also affected by the depletion of Cdc7 kinase. Treatment of cells with a cross-linking agent, cisplatin increased the phosphorylation of all stress-activated protein kinases, while depletion of Cdc7 by siRNA only increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the activation of p38 MAPK occurs through a unique signaling pathway induced by Cdc7 depletion. ATR-dependent Activation of p38 MAPK Is Responsible for Induction of Apoptosis in Cdc7-depleted Cells—Because the activation of p38 MAPK was a specific response to Cdc7 depletion, we searched for upstream effectors of the p38 MAPK. In most cases, cellular responses to DNA damage or replication stress are initiated by the activation of sensor kinases, such as ATM or ATR. Therefore, we examined whether these sensor kinases were involved in the activation of p38 MAPK. When Cdc7-depleted cells were treated with caffeine, a well known inhibitor of the ATM and ATR kinases, the activating phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and MK2 was completely blocked (Fig. 4A). Previous results have indicated that ATM is not activated in Cdc7-depleted cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the ATR sensor kinase was responsible for the activation of p38 MAPK. Indeed, the siRNA-targeted down-regulation of ATR alone completely eliminated the activation of both p38 MAPK and MK2 (Fig. 4B). Thus, the action of ATR is required for the activation of p38 MAPK in Cdc7-depleted cells. Generally, p38 MAPK is known to be activated by the upstream MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), such as MKK3 and MKK6. However, we did not observe a clear increase in the activating phosphorylation of MKK3/MKK6 or MKK4 after Cdc7 depletion (Fig. 4C). To examine the role of p38 MAPK on apoptosis in Cdc7-depleted cells, we tested whether the induction of apoptosis was prevented by inhibiting the p38 pathway. Treatment of cells with SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, completely prevented cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the down-regulation of p38 MAPK with siRNAs against p38α also inhibited the activation of apoptosis in Cdc7-depleted cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, depletion of MK2 did not prevent the activation of the apoptotic pathway (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that the activation of p38 MAPK is responsible for inducing apoptosis in Cdc7-depleted cells, and MK2 is not a downstream effecter in this process. When the pathways for apoptotic activation was examined, cells depleted of Cdc7 showed an increase of FAS-L and the activation of caspase 8 as well as the activation of caspase 9 (Fig. 6). Therefore, the activation of p38 MAPK appears to induce apoptotic cell death by activating both the death receptor and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways.FIGURE 6Depletion of Cdc7 induces apoptosis via triggering both internal and external pathways. Cells transfected with Cdc7 siRNA were incubated for 48 h and then analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for caspase 9, cleaved forms of caspase 8, or Fas-L. Cells treated with 20 μm cisplatin were used as the positive control for the induction of apoptosis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we demonstrated that the p38 MAPK, a stress-activated protein kinase, is an essential factor required for apoptotic cell death in Cdc7-depleted cancer cells. Among three well known stress-activated protein kinases, JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK is the only one activated in Cdc7-depleted cells, and this activation requires ATR, a major sensor kinase for checkpoint response. The activation of p38 MAPK leads to the apoptotic cell death in Cdc7-depleted cells by activating both death receptor and mitochondrial pathways. Although p38 MAPK is known to be involved in inducing apoptotic cell death in response to a variety of stress conditions, this is the first report showing that the inactivation of a replication protein induces apoptotic cell death via activation of p38 MAPK in cancer cells. As shown in this study, the cellular apoptotic pathway that is activated by Cdc7 depletion appears to be similar to that activated by treatment with cisplatin. Cisplatin treatment results in long-term activation of p38 MAPK, which can persist for several days. This long-lasting activation of p38 MAPK, which is accompanied by the sustained up-regulation of AP-1 and FAS-L, is required for the induction of apoptosis (19Roos W.P. Kaina B. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 440-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Apoptosis occurs late and typically starts 2–4 days following exposure to cisplatin (23Brozovic A. Fritz G. Christmann M. Zisowsky J. Jaehde U. Osmak M. Kaina B. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 112: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, the induction of apoptosis in Cdc7-depleted cells appeared rapidly within a few hours after entry into the S phase (Fig. 1C). We reason that this difference may be due to the defects in the Chk1/Chk2 pathway in Cdc7-depleted cells (Fig. 1D). Cells treated with cisplatin activate both the Chk1/Chk2-dependent checkpoint pathway as well as p38 MAPK. It has been reported that inactivation of the Chk1/Chk2-dependent checkpoint pathway increased apoptotic cell death induced by cisplatin or ionizing radiation (24Carrassa L. Broggini M. Erba E. Damia G. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Kinzel B. Hall J. Natt F. Weiler J. Cohen D. Cancer. 2002; 94: 1808-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that cells depleted of Cdc7 are more susceptible to apoptotic cell death because of defects in Chk1/Chk2 pathways. Generally, when cells undergo replication stress caused by DNA damages or the presence of inhibitors of replication, the Chk1/Chk2-dependent checkpoint pathways are activated to prevent cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis (26Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 27Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nature Rev. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Cdc7 depletion did not elicit activation of the Chk1/Chk2-dependent checkpoint pathways. Because Cdc7 is essential for the initiation of DNA replication, the lack of checkpoint activation in Cdc7-depleted cells may reflect an insufficient accumulation of single stranded DNA regions or formation of double strand breaks, both of which are recognized by the sensor proteins ATR and ATM, respectively. However, the activation of ATR in Cdc7-depleted cells appeared to be normal since the activation of p38 MAPK requires the activity of ATR. These results indicate that Cdc7 is not only required for the initiation of DNA replication, but is also required for the ATR-dependent activation of Chk1/Chk2. Consistent with these results, it has recently been suggested that Cdc7 kinase mediates the phosphorylation of Claspin, which is required for replication checkpoint (10Kim J.M. Kakusho N. Yamada M. Kanoh Y. Takemoto N. Masai H. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As a result of these two functions, Cdc7 depletion leads to apoptotic cell death, which would not occur when other replication proteins are inactivated. Among the members of the p38 MAPK family (p38α, β, γ, and δ), p38α is the most abundant kinase expressed in most cell types (28Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 29Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar, 30Enslen H. Brancho D.M. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). p38α is also known to sensitize cells to apoptosis by both up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins and down-regulation of survival pathways (31Porras A. Zuluaga S. Black E. Valladares A. Alvarez A.M. Ambrosino C. Benito M. Nebreda A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the case of cells depleted of Cdc7, the induction of apoptosis also appears to occur via the activation of p38α, because the siRNA against p38α almost completely prevented the activation of caspase 3 (Fig. 5B). In this study, the activation of p38 MAPK in Cdc7-depleted cells was shown to depend on ATR, a major sensor protein required for checkpoint responses (Fig. 5). In contrast, the activation of p38 MAPK in UV-irradiated cells did not require ATM or ATR (17Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These differences suggest that the mechanism of p38 MAPK activation varies depending on the stress conditions. Although the mechanism by which ATR activates p38 MAPK remains to be resolved, it is plausible that ATR affects the activities of the MAPKKs or MAPK kinase kinases directly or indirectly. MKK3 and MKK6 are generally known to activate p38 MAPK, and other MAPKKs, such as MKK4, may also contribute to the activation of p38 MAPK as was shown in UV-irradiated cells (32Brancho D. Tanaka N. Jaeschke A. Ventura J.J. Kelkar N. Tanaka Y. Kyuuma M. Takeshita T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To date, however, we have not detected a clear activation of MKK3, MKK6, and MKK4 in Cdc7-depleted cells (Fig. 4C). Despite this, it is still possible that several MAPKKs are involved in the activation of p38 MAPK in Cdc7-depleted cells. Although the apoptosis-inducing activity of p38 MAPK has been well established in many systems, p38 MAPK activation also plays important roles in checkpoint response to DNA damages. One of the p38 MAPK targets for checkpoint responses is MK2, a kinase that plays a similar role to Chk2. It was reported that p38-dependent activation of MK2 led to the phosphorylation of Cdc25B or degradation of Cdc25A, which was required for the UV or cisplatin-induced checkpoint pathway (18Manke I.A. Nguyen A. Lim D. Stewart M.Q. Elia A.E. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 33Reinhardt H.C. Aslanian A.S. Lees J.A. Yaffe M.B. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 175-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The role of the p38 MAPK/MK2 pathway in cell survival was further confirmed by demonstrating that the depletion of MK2 after DNA damage reduced cell survival in p53-deficient cells (33Reinhardt H.C. Aslanian A.S. Lees J.A. Yaffe M.B. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 175-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Although p38-dependent activation of MK2 was observed in Cdc7-depleted cells (Fig. 3A), a majority of the cells still underwent apoptotic cell death instead of cell cycle arrest. One possible explanation for this result is the absence of the Chk1/Chk2 pathway in Cdc7-depleted cells. Exposure of cells to UV or other genotoxic stress activated the MK2 as well as the Chk1/Chk2 pathways. The combined action of these two pathways appeared to be important for cell cycle arrest (18Manke I.A. Nguyen A. Lim D. Stewart M.Q. Elia A.E. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 33Reinhardt H.C. Aslanian A.S. Lees J.A. Yaffe M.B. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 175-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The activation of the MK2 pathway alone in the absence of the Chk1/Chk2 activation, which occurred in Cdc7-depleted cells, may not be sufficient to arrest the cell cycle. As previously reported, Cdc7 depletion did not elicit apoptotic cell death in normal human fibroblast cells (22Montagnoli A. Tenca P. Sola F. Carpani D. Brotherton D. Albanese C. Santocanale C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7110-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), but the activation of p38 MAPK was still observed (data not presented). However, the activation of p38 MAPK in normal cells did not induce apoptosis. In normal cells, there are many redundant checkpoint pathways leading to cell cycle arrest (Fig. 7). Although the Chk1/Chk2 pathway is rendered defective in Cdc7-depleted normal cells, the activation of p53 and the concomitant up-regulation of p21, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases can lead to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary (34Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar, 35Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). p38-dependent activation of MK2 also plays a significant role in cell cycle arrest and cell survival (18Manke I.A. Nguyen A. Lim D. Stewart M.Q. Elia A.E. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 36Lemaire M. Froment C. Boutros R. Mondesert O. Nebreda A.R. Monsarrat B. Ducommun B. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1649-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the loss of normal checkpoint functions and the up-regulation of signaling pathways that lead to rapid cell proliferation are common in many different cancer cells (11Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar, 12Rodriguez-Bravo V. Guaita-Esteruelas S. Florensa R. Bachs O. Agell N. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8672-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The lack of p53 and Chk1/Chk2 pathways in the presence of a replication stress (as observed in Cdc7-depleted HeLa cells) may further amplify the signals for ATR/p38 MAPK activation, which would eventually lead to apoptotic cell death (Fig. 7). Aberrations in the cell cycle or checkpoint related proteins, such as Rb, p16, cyclins, and Cdc25, would also affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to the depletion of Cdc7. Based on these observations Cdc7 appears to be an attractive target for the development of anticancer drugs. Furthermore, drugs that specifically inhibit Cdc7 kinase activity would be particularly effective in the treatment of cancer cells that harbor defects in the checkpoint function such as p53. We thank Dr. Jerard Hurwitz for helpful discussions and critical review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2100203743,"Angiogenesis is induced by multiple growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). In vascular endothelium VEGF signals through two receptor-tyrosine kinases, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. The VEGFR1 gene encodes both a receptor-tyrosine kinase and a secreted splice variant, soluble VEGFR1. Whereas VEGFR1 is essential for vascular development, mechanisms that regulate VEGFR1 expression in endothelial cells are poorly understood. We demonstrate here that in endothelial cells, FGF2 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling induce VEGFR1 mRNA expression in a combinatorial fashion. EGF/FGF2-mediated VEGFR1 induction is mediated via functional interaction of transcription factors ETS1 and HIF-2alpha. Mechanistic analyses revealed that in endothelial cells EGF/FGF2 signaling induces ETS1 expression, increases HIF-2alpha protein level in absence of hypoxia, and recruits both ETS1 and HIF-2alpha to the VEGFR1 chromatin domain. Knockdown of ETS1 and HIF-2alpha by RNA interference inhibits EGF/FGF2-induced VEGFR1 expression, and loss of expression is associated with impaired RNA-polymerase II recruitment and histone modifications at the VEGFR1 promoter region. In addition, using a mouse embryonic stem cell in vitro differentiation system, we found that induction of VEGFR1 in embryoid bodies is also associated with ETS1 and HIF-2alpha recruitment to the VEGFR1 locus. These results establish an angiogenic signal-ETS1/HIF-2alpha axis that regulates the VEGFR1 chromatin domain to induce VEGFR1 transcription in endothelial cells and in differentiating embryonic stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2034900027,"Despite their importance as pollinators in crops and wild plants, solitary bees have not previously been included in non-target testing of insect-resistant transgenic crop plants. Larvae of many solitary bees feed almost exclusively on pollen and thus could be highly exposed to transgene products expressed in the pollen. The potential effects of pollen from oilseed rape expressing the cysteine protease inhibitor oryzacystatin-1 (OC-1) were investigated on larvae of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis ( = O. rufa). Furthermore, recombinant OC-1 (rOC-1), the Bt toxin Cry1Ab and the snowdrop lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) were evaluated for effects on the life history parameters of this important pollinator. Pollen provisions from transgenic OC-1 oilseed rape did not affect overall development. Similarly, high doses of rOC-1 and Cry1Ab as well as a low dose of GNA failed to cause any significant effects. However, a high dose of GNA (0.1%) in the larval diet resulted in significantly increased development time and reduced efficiency in conversion of pollen food into larval body weight. Our results suggest that OC-1 and Cry1Ab expressing transgenic crops would pose a negligible risk for O. bicornis larvae, whereas GNA expressing plants could cause detrimental effects, but only if bees were exposed to high levels of the protein. The described bioassay with bee brood is not only suitable for early tier non-target tests of transgenic plants, but also has broader applicability to other crop protection products."
https://openalex.org/W2088705460,"Biochemistry and structural biology are undergoing a dramatic revolution. Until now, mostly in vitro techniques have been used to study subtle and complex biological processes under conditions usually remote from those existing in the cell. We developed a novel in-cell methodology to post-translationally modify interactor proteins and identify the amino acids that comprise the interaction surface of a target protein when bound to the post-translationally modified interactors. Modifying the interactor proteins causes structural changes that manifest themselves on the interacting surface of the target protein and these changes are monitored using in-cell NMR. We show how Ubiquitin interacts with phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated components of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) endocytic sorting machinery: STAM2 (Signal-transducing adaptor molecule), Hrs (Hepatocyte growth factor regulated substrate) and the STAM2-Hrs heterodimer. Ubiquitin binding mediates the processivity of a large network of interactions required for proper functioning of the RTK sorting machinery. The results are consistent with a weakening of the network of interactions when the interactor proteins are phosphorylated. The methodology can be applied to any stable target molecule and may be extended to include other post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination or sumoylation, thus providing a long-awaited leap to high resolution in cell biochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2089716206,"In a search for Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) interaction proteins, we have identified TRF1 (telomeric repeat binding factor 1) as a potential Plk1 target. In this communication we report further characterization of the interaction. We show that Plk1 associates with TRF1, and Plk1 phosphorylates TRF1 at Ser-435 in vivo. Moreover, Cdk1, serving as a priming kinase, phosphorylates TRF1 to generate a docking site for Plk1 toward TRF1. In the presence of nocodazole, ectopic expression of wild type TRF1 but not TRF1 with alanine mutation in the Plk1 phosphorylation site induces apoptosis in cells containing short telomeres but not in cells containing long telomeres. Unexpectedly, down-regulation of TRF1 by RNA interference affects cell proliferation and results in obvious apoptosis in cells with short telomeres but not in cells with long telomeres. Importantly, we observe that telomeric DNA binding ability of TRF1 is cell cycle-regulated and reaches a peak during mitosis. Upon phosphorylation by Plk1 in vivo and in vitro, the ability of TRF1 to bind telomeric DNA is dramatically increased. These results demonstrate that Plk1 interacts with and phosphorylates TRF1 and suggest that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation is involved in both TRF1 overexpression-induced apoptosis and its telomeric DNA binding ability. In a search for Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) interaction proteins, we have identified TRF1 (telomeric repeat binding factor 1) as a potential Plk1 target. In this communication we report further characterization of the interaction. We show that Plk1 associates with TRF1, and Plk1 phosphorylates TRF1 at Ser-435 in vivo. Moreover, Cdk1, serving as a priming kinase, phosphorylates TRF1 to generate a docking site for Plk1 toward TRF1. In the presence of nocodazole, ectopic expression of wild type TRF1 but not TRF1 with alanine mutation in the Plk1 phosphorylation site induces apoptosis in cells containing short telomeres but not in cells containing long telomeres. Unexpectedly, down-regulation of TRF1 by RNA interference affects cell proliferation and results in obvious apoptosis in cells with short telomeres but not in cells with long telomeres. Importantly, we observe that telomeric DNA binding ability of TRF1 is cell cycle-regulated and reaches a peak during mitosis. Upon phosphorylation by Plk1 in vivo and in vitro, the ability of TRF1 to bind telomeric DNA is dramatically increased. These results demonstrate that Plk1 interacts with and phosphorylates TRF1 and suggest that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation is involved in both TRF1 overexpression-induced apoptosis and its telomeric DNA binding ability. Composed of repetitive DNA sequences of TTAGGG arrays (in vertebrates) and telomere-binding proteins (1de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar), telomeres are specialized DNA structures positioned at the termini of eukaryotic chromosomes (2Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Telomeric DNA together with specific and nonspecific telomere-binding proteins participates in forming highly ordered structures that protect the ends of chromosomes from exonucleolytic attack, end-to-end fusion, and degradation leading to cell death, possible genetic recombination, or survival selection (1de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar, 3Blasco M.A. Lee H.W. Hande M.P. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W.

A. 2006; 103: 11874-11879Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Most human normal somatic cells show a progressive loss of telomeric DNA during successive rounds of cell division due to incomplete DNA replication at the most terminal lagging-strand synthesis (4O'Connor M.S.

Science. 1995; 269: 1533-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Thus, telomere shortening functions as a control mechanism that regulates the replicative capacity of cells and cellular senescence (6Stewart S.A. Weinberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 531-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Telomeres are regulated by a homeostatic mechanism that includes telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that adds telomeric TTAGGG repeats onto the 3′ end of chromosomes (7Cech T.R. Cell. 2004; 116: 273-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 8Chan S.R. Blackburn E.H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol.

Although the TRF1 complex contains TRF1, TRF1 interacting partners, TIN2, TPP1, and POT1, the TRF2 complex contains TRF2 and its interacting partner RAP1 (1de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar, 4O'Connor M.S. Safari A. Xin H. Liu D. Songyang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11874-11879Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). TRF1 has been shown to negatively regulate telomere length. Overexpression of TRF1 accelerates telomere shortening, whereas dominant-negative inhibition of TRF1 leads to telomere elongation (9van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). TRF2, a distant homologue of TRF1, also binds to telomeric DNA as a homodimer through the Myb-like domain (10Bilaud T. Brun C. Ancelin K. Koering C.E. Laroche T. Gilson E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). TRF2 is required to protect chromosomal ends (van Steensel et al.

In addition to its well documented role in telomere length control, accumulating evidence suggests that TRF1 is involved in mitosis as well. It has been reported that overexpression of TRF1 induces premature mitotic entry and subsequent apoptosis in cells with short telomeres (13Kishi S. Wulf G. Nakamura M. Lu K.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, before entering apoptosis, TRF1 expression results in accumulation of cells in G2 or M phase of the cell cycle (13Kishi S. Wulf G. Nakamura M. Lu K.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, TRF1 associates with telomere chromatin specifically in mitotic egg extracts and dissociates from it upon mitotic exit (15Nishiyama A. Muraki K. Saito M. Ohsumi K. Kishimoto T. Ishikawa F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The polo-like kinases (Plks) are a conserved subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases that play pivotal roles during cell cycle and proliferation (16van Vugt M.A. Medema R.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2844-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, four Plks (Plk1–4) exist, but their expression patterns and functions appear to be distinct from each other (17Winkles J.A. Alberts G.F. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Among these, Plk1 has been the focus of extensive studies because of its association with neoplastic transformation of human cells (18Eckerdt F. Yuan J. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Studies show that Plk1, which is expressed and active in mitosis, plays a critical role in various aspects of mitotic events such as mitotic entry, centrosome maturation, spindle pole assembly, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis (16van Vugt M.A. Medema R.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2844-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 19Barr F.A. Sillje H.H. Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In a search for Plk1 interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified TRF1 as a Plk1 interacting partner. In this study we further characterize the interaction between Plk1 and TRF1 and show that TRF1 is a Plk1 substrate in vitro and in vivo. Significantly, overexpression of wild type TRF1, but not TRF1, with an alanine mutation in the Plk1 phosphorylation site (TRF1-S435A) induces apoptosis in cells containing short telomeres, suggesting an essential role of Plk1 in TRF1-induced apoptosis in these cells. Down-regulation of TRF1 by RNA interference affects cell proliferation and also results in obvious apoptosis in cells with short telomeres but not in cells with long telomeres. Importantly, we observe that telomeric DNA binding ability of TRF1 is cell cycle-regulated, reaching a peak during mitosis. Upon phosphorylation by Plk1 in vivo and in vitro, the DNA binding ability of TRF1 is dramatically increased, suggesting that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation positively regulates the ability of TRF1 to bind telomeres. Generation of Plasmid Constructs—Full-length human TRF1 (NM_017489), kindly provided by de Lange (Rockefeller University, New York, NY), was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-KG vector (GST fusion vector, Amersham Biosciences) and pEGFP-C1 (GFP fusion vector, Clontech). Human TRF1 mutants were made with site-directed mutagenesis by using the QuikChange kit (catalog number 200523) from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's instructions. pLKO.1-TRF1 RNA interference vector was constructed as described previously (20Liu X. Lei M. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2093-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and the targeting sequence of TRF1 is 5′-GGAACATGACAAACTTCATGA-3′, corresponding to 489–509 of the coding region relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. All of the mutageneses were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture, Synchronization, and DNA Transfections—HeLa, HEK293T, HT1080, and A-T22IJE-T (ATM-/-) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units ml-1 penicillin, and 100 units ml-1 streptomycin at 37 °C in 8% CO2. For synchronization, cells were treated with mimosine (0.3 mm) for 16 h, hydroxyurea (4 mm) for 24 h, or nocodazole (100 ng ml-1) for 14 h to arrest cells at G1, S, or M phase, respectively. Alternatively, cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 16 h, released for 8 h, and then treated with thymidine a second time for 16 h. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were cultured for different times as indicated in each experiment and harvested. Cells were transfected with mammalian expression constructs by GenePORTER transfection reagent from Genlantis (catalog number T201075). Recombinant Protein Purification—Full-length and various domains of TRF1 were subcloned into pGEX-KG vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. Expression was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 5 h after the cell density had reached 0.5 at 600 nm. To express GST-Plk1, Hi5 insect cells were infected with baculovirus-encoding GST-Plk1 and harvested 36 h after infection. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads from Sigma (catalog number G4510) followed by extensive washes with STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and elution with glutathione elution buffer (40 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Cell Extract Preparations—Total nuclear extracts were prepared by using a kit from ActiveMotif (catalog number 40410) according to the manufacturer's instructions with a slight modification. Briefly, cells were lysed in the hypotonic buffer for 15 min on ice. After the lysates were vortexed for 10 s in the presence of detergent and centrifuged, the pellets were collected. The pellets were then resuspended in the complete lysis buffer containing Benzonase nuclease (Sigma, catalog number E1014), a nuclease that digests genomic DNA and releases nuclear proteins intimately associated with DNA. The suspensions were incubated for 1 h with gentle agitation at 4 °C. The lysates were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min as nuclear extracts. Immunoprecipitation (IP), Immunoblot, Far Western Blot, and GST Pulldown Assays—Cell lysates were incubated with GFP (Invitrogen, catalog number A11122), TRF1 (Sigma, catalog number T1948), or Plk1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., catalog number 33-1700) antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by a 2-h incubation with protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology.). Immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transfer to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Immunoblot analyses were performed using antibodies against TRF1 (Sigma or Abcam, catalog number ab1423), GFP, Erk2, Plk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-17783), TopoIIβ (TopGEN, catalog number 2010-3), and FLAG (Sigma, catalog number F3165) followed by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and detection using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Far Western blots were performed as described previously (21Wu Z.Q. Liu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1919-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes containing the different TRF1 proteins were incubated in blocking buffer (PBST (PBS, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Tween 20) and 3% w/v nonfat milk powder) for 2 h at room temperature followed by a 2-h incubation in PBS containing 2 μg/ml of recombinant GST-Plk1-PBD (polo-box domain). The membrane was extensively washed with PBST and probed with an anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-138). The membrane was then stripped and probed with an anti-GFP antibody. For GST pulldown assays, the lysates of nocodazole-treated HeLa cells in TBSN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) supplemented with protease inhibitors were precleared with glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h and incubated with glutathione-agarose beads containing GST or GST-TRF1 at 4 °C for 2.5 h. The beads were harvested, washed extensively with TBSN buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-Plk1 antibody. Kinase Assays—In vitro kinase assays were performed in TBMD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) supplemented with 125 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol-1, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of purified GST-TRF1 proteins. For sequential kinase assays, purified GST-TRF1-WT or GST-TRF1-T344A/T371A proteins were preincubated for 1 h at 30 °C in a total volume of 40 μl with or without Cdk1/cyclin B (New England Biolabs, catalog number P6020) in the presence of unlabeled ATP (1 mm). All samples were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and GST-Plk1-WT. Samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Staining and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS) Analysis—Cells growing on coverslips were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA) for 1 min, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PEM for 5 min, and subsequently permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer for 30 min. After blocking in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, cells were incubated with an anti-TRF1 antibody at room temperature overnight followed by incubation with a secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, DNA was stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. For FACS analysis, cells were harvested and fixed for 30 min in ice-cold 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were resuspended in PBS containing RNase A (200 μgml-1) and propidium iodide (50 μgml-1) and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Metabolic Labeling—Metabolic labeling was performed essentially as described (22Lin C.Y. Madsen M.L. Yarm F.R. Jang Y.J. Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12589-12594Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were labeled for 3.5 h with [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 1 mCi ml-1 in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium followed by incubation with okadaic acid (1.0 μm) for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared and incubated with an anti-GFP antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A PLUS-agarose beads for additional 3 h. The beads were washed with TBSN buffer containing 500 mm NaCl for 5 times and with TBSN buffer containing 150 mm NaCl for 10 times. Samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography and Western blot analysis. In Vitro Gel-shift Assays—In vitro gel-shift assays were performed essentially as described (23Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) with an end-labeled 142-bp HindIII-Asp-718 fragment from plasmid pTH12 containing 12 tandem TTAGGG repeats (24Zhong Z. Shiue L. Kaplan S. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4834-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The bacterially expressed TRF1 proteins were incubated with the end-labeled DNA at room temperature for 30 min in a 40-μl reaction containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) Ficoll, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 500 ng of sheared E. coli DNA, and 100 ng of casein. The DNA-protein complexes were fractionated on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel with 1× TBE (90 mm Tris base, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) as a running buffer. Gels were dried onto Whatman DE81 paper and autoradiographed. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed as described (25Loayza D. De Lange T. Nature. 2003; 423: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In brief, after digestion with trypsin and washing with PBS, cells were fixed in 1% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, quenched with 125 mm glycine, washed with PBS, and lysed in the lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors mixture (BD Biosciences). Lysates were sonicated to obtain chromatin fragments <1 kilobase and centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C. Two hundred microliters of lysates were diluted with 1 ml of 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl and incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with 40 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (pre-blocked with 30 μg of bovine serum albumin and 5 μg of sheared E. coli DNA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated pellets were washed with 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl in the first wash and 500 mm NaCl in the second wash. Further washes were with 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Chromatin was eluted from the beads with 500 μl of 1% SDS, 0.1 m Na2CO3. After the addition of 20 μl of 5 m NaCl, cross links were reversed overnight at 65 °C. Samples were supplemented with 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and 20 μg of DNase-free RNase A and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After samples were digested with 50 μg of proteinase K (Calbiochem) for 60 min at 42 °C and phenol-extracted, the DNA was precipitated overnight at -20 °C with 2.5 volumes ethanol and 0.1 volume sodium acetate (3 m, pH 5.2). The precipitate was dissolved in water, denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and blotted onto Hybond membranes in 20× SSC. Membranes were treated with 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 n NaOH for 10 min, neutralized with 1 m NaCl, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 for 10 min, dried for 1 h at 80 °C, rinsed with 6× SSC for 5 min, prehybridized with 5× Denhardt's solution, 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 100 μgml-1 denatured sperm DNA (Sigma) overnight at 68 °C, and hybridized with a 800-bp Klenow-labeled TTAGGG probe overnight at 68 °C (Addgene plasmid 12401) (26de Lange T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed for 15 min at room temperature with 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS in the first wash and 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS in the second wash. Further washes were with 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequent wash at 68 °C. Finally, the membrane was rinsed with 0.1× SSC and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. TRF1 Localizes In Nucleus, and Its Protein Expression Is Not Cell Cycle-regulated—It was reported that overexpressed HA-PIN2, a splicing variant of TRF1, is regulated during the cell cycle progression, with the highest expression level at mitosis (14Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To examine whether the protein level of endogenous TRF1 is also cell cycle-regulated, HeLa cells were treated with nocodazole for 16 h and harvested by mitotic shake-off. Extracts of asynchronous or mitotic cells were fractioned into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and subjected to Western blot analysis using two different commercial antibodies against TRF1. We found that TRF1 is localized in the nuclear fraction, and its protein level in asynchronous cells is similar to that in mitotic cells, suggesting that TRF1 protein level is not cell cycle-regulated in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). Next, we used double thymidine block to arrest HeLa cells at G1/S boundary, and then the cells were released to different cell cycle stages as monitored by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1C). Again, TRF1 protein level remains the same during cell cycle progression (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we asked whether this is also the case in other cell lines. Our data showed that TRF1 protein level is not cell cycle-regulated in HEK293T and HT1080 cells (data not shown). Consistent with the data from Western blot analysis, anti-TRF1 immunofluorescence staining showed a punctate pattern in detergent-extracted nuclei (Fig. 1D). Interaction between Plk1 and TRF1 in Vitro and in Vivo—In a search for Plk1 interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system as a candidate approach, we have identified TRF1 as a potential Plk1 target. To further confirm the association between Plk1 and TRF1, a GST pulldown assay was performed. Purified GST or GST-TRF1 protein (bound to glutathione-agarose beads) was incubated with precleared lysates of nocodazole-treated HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, Plk1 protein associated with GST-TRF1 protein, but not with GST protein, suggesting that Plk1 interacts with TRF1 in vitro. To confirm the association between TRF1 and Plk1 in vivo, HeLa cells were treated with mimosine, hydroxyurea, or nocodazole to arrest cells at G1, S, or M phase, respectively. Total nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to Plk1 or TRF1 antibody IP. As indicated, endogenous or overexpressed TRF1 was coimmunoprecipitated with Plk1 in nocodazole- or mimosine-treated cells but not in hydroxyurea-treated cells, suggesting that the binding occurs in both mitosis and G1 phase (Fig. 2, B and D). Moreover, we found that Plk1 was also coimmunoprecipitated with TRF1 in nocodazole-treated cells, further confirming the binding of Plk1 with TRF1 during mitosis (Fig. 2C). Plk1 Phosphorylates TRF1 in Vitro and in Vivo—Considering a strong binding between TRF1 and Plk1 in vivo, we asked whether TRF1 is a substrate of Plk1. Toward this end, purified full-length (aa 1–439), N-terminal (aa 1–215), or C-terminal (aa 216–439) TRF1 was incubated with purified Plk1-WT or -K82M (kinase dead mutant) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 3B, both full-length and the C terminus of TRF1 yielded a strong phosphorylation signal. To further narrow down the site, three non-overlapping TRF1 fragments (aa 216–268, 269–321, and 322–439) were subjected to a kinase reaction, and only the domain containing amino acids 322–439 was a robust substrate for Plk1 (Fig. 3C). Next, virtually every serine in the amino acids 322–439 domain was mutated into alanine to map the potential phosphorylation site for Plk1. Compared with the phosphorylation level of TRF1-WT (aa 322–439), the phosphorylation level of TRF1-S435A was completely abolished, indicating that Ser-435 is the phosphorylation site for Plk1 in vitro (Fig. 3D). We further introduced S435A mutation in the context of full-length of TRF1 and showed that full-length TRF1-S435A was not detectably phosphorylated by Plk1 in vitro (Fig. 3E). As shown in Fig. 3A, Ser-435 localizes in Myb-type DNA binding domain, which is highly conserved from Xenopus to human. To determine whether this site influences TRF1 phosphorylation in vivo, HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-TRF1-WT or -S435A. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with nocodazole for 8 h and labeled for 3.5 h with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence of nocodazole followed by incubation with okadaic acid for 0.5 h. TRF1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody, and the level of TRF1 phosphorylation was determined (Fig. 3F). The mutation S435A significantly reduced but not completely abolished TRF1 phosphorylation in vivo, suggesting that Ser-435 is one of major sites phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 3F). To provide direct evidence that TRF1 is an in vivo substrate of Plk1, HeLa cells were transfected with pBS/U6-Plk1 to deplete Plk1, metabolically labeled, and harvested. Lysates were subjected to anti-TRF1 IP followed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3G, depletion of Plk1 significantly reduced the phosphorylation of endogenous TRF1, suggesting that Plk1 is a TRF1 kinase in vivo. To determine whether Plk1 is responsible for TRF1-Ser-435 phosphorylation in vivo, 293T cells were cotransfected with GFP-TRF1 (WT or S435A) and FLAG-Plk1 (WT or KM). At 36 h post-transfection, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Again, the mutation S435A significantly reduced, but not completely eliminated, TRF1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3H, upper panel, first versus second lanes). There was also detectable phosphorylation of both GFP-TRF1-WT and -S435A when cells were cotransfected with FLAG-Plk1-KM (Fig. 3G, upper panel, third and fourth lanes), suggesting that additional protein kinases may be involved in TRF1 phosphorylation in vivo. Taken collectively, these data strongly indicate that Plk1 phosphorylates TRF1 at Ser-435 in vitro and in vivo. Priming Phosphorylation of TRF1 by Cdk1 Enhances Recruitment of Plk1 to TRF1—Cdk1-associated phosphorylation has been shown to generate a docking site to recruit Plk1 toward its substrates, such as Cdc25C (27Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W. Ivins F.J. Hoepker K. Mohammad D. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B.

Science. 2003; 299: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). We asked whether the TRF1-Plk1 interaction is regulated by a similar mechanism. Accordingly, recombinant Cdk1/cyclin B was incubated with purified TRF1-WT or various TRF1 threonine to alanine mutants in the presence of [λ-32P]ATP. We showed that TRF1 is a robust substrate of Cdk1 and that Thr-344 and Thr-371 are the two sites phosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, we tested whether the phosphorylation state of Cdk1 sites would affect Plk1 binding to TRF1 in vivo. For that purpose, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-TRF1-WT or -T344A/T371A constructs and then treated with nocodazole. Nuclear extracts were prepared, subjected to anti-Plk1 IP, and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4C, introduction of the T344A/T371A mutations strongly reduced the binding affinity between Plk1 and TRF1, suggesting that Cdk1-associated priming phosphorylation might generate a docking site for Plk1. Furthermore, Far Western blots were used to test the direct binding between Plk1-PBD and TRF1. After cells were transfected with GFP-TRF1 and treated with nocodazole, and nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to anti-GFP IP. The IP pellets were resolved by SDS/PAGE and transferred to a membrane, and the membrane was incubated with GST-Plk1-PBD. After extensive washes, the membrane was probed with a GST antibody. As shown in Fig. 4D, T344A/T371A dramatically reduced the binding of Plk1-PBD with TRF1,"
https://openalex.org/W2046789235,"The pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus (CoV) remains poorly understood. In the current study, two recombinant baculovirus were generated to express the spike (S) protein of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) isolated from bats (vAcBS) and the envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins of SARS-CoV, respectively. Co-infection of insect cells with these two recombinant baculoviruses led to self-assembly of virus-like particles (BVLPs) as demonstrated by electron microscopy. Incorporation of S protein of vAcBS (BS) into VLPs was confirmed by western blot and immunogold labeling. Such BVLPs up-regulated the level of CD40, CD80, CD86, CD83, and enhanced the secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α in immature dendritic cells (DCs). Immune responses were compared in immature DCs inoculated with BVLPs or with VLPs formed by S, E and M proteins of human SARS-CoV. BVLPs showed a stronger ability to stimulate DCs in terms of cytokine induction as evidenced by 2 to 6 fold higher production of IL-6 and TNF-α. Further study indicated that IFN-γ+ and IL-4+ populations in CD4+ T cells increased upon co-cultivation with DCs pre-exposed with BVLPs or SARS-CoV VLPs. The observed difference in DC-stimulating activity between BVLPs and SARS CoV VLPs was very likely due to the S protein. In agreement, SL-CoV S DNA vaccine evoked a more vigorous antibody response and a stronger T cell response than SARS-CoV S DNA in mice. Our data have demonstrated for the first time that SL-CoV VLPs formed by membrane proteins of different origins, one from SL-CoV isolated from bats (BS) and the other two from human SARS-CoV (E and M), activated immature DCs and enhanced the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and the secretion of cytokines. Finding in this study may provide important information for vaccine development as well as for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-like CoV."
https://openalex.org/W2056587237,"We have characterized the properties and putative role of a mammalian thioredoxin-like protein, ERp16 (previously designated ERp18, ERp19, or hTLP19). The predicted amino acid sequence of the 172-residue human protein contains an NH2-terminal signal peptide, a thioredoxin-like domain with an active site motif (CGAC), and a COOH-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention sequence (EDEL). Analyses indicated that the mature protein (comprising 146 residues) is generated by cleavage of the 26-residue signal peptide and is localized in the lumen of the ER. Biochemical experiments with the recombinant mature protein revealed it to be a thioldisulfide oxidoreductase. Its redox potential was about -165 mV; its active site cysteine residue Cys66 was nucleophilic with a pKa value of ∼6.6; it catalyzed the formation, reduction, and isomerization of disulfide bonds, with the unusual CGAC active site motif being responsible for these activities; and it existed as a dimer and underwent a redox-dependent conformational change. The observations that the redox potential of ERp16 (-165 mV) was within the range of that of the ER (-135 to -185 mV) and that ERp16 catalyzed disulfide isomerization of scrambled ribonuclease A suggest a role for ERp16 in protein disulfide isomerization in the ER. Expression of ERp16 in HeLa cells inhibited the induction of apoptosis by agents that elicit ER stress, including brefeldin A, tunicamycin, and dithiothreitol. In contrast, expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of ERp16 potentiated such apoptosis, as did depletion of ERp16 by RNA interference. Our results suggest that ERp16 mediates disulfide bond formation in the ER and plays an important role in cellular defense against prolonged ER stress.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). The formation of disulfide bonds is an important step in the maturation of these secreted and membrane proteins (3Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The most common mechanism for the formation of such bonds is a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction of free thiols with disulfide-bonded molecules (3Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). A class of proteins known as thioldisulfide oxidoreductases catalyzes this reaction. The activity of these proteins depends on a CXXC motif, which is usually present in a domain related to the small redox protein thioredoxin (Trx) (4Holmgren A. Annu. Rev.

The most extensively studied thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase is protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is an abundant ER protein with two redox-active Trx domains (5Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). PDI catalyzes the formation, reshuffling, or reduction of disulfide bonds in a manner dependent on the redox environment and the characteristics of the substrate protein (6Freedman R.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 7Noiva R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). PDI consists of four structural domains: a, b, b′, and a′ (8Ferrari D.M. Soling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The homologous a and a′ domains share amino acid sequence similarity with Trx and contain the active site sequence, CGHC. Biochemical studies with the isolated domains have shown that the thiol-disulfide exchange reaction requires only the a or a′ domain and that the b′ domain provides a binding site for small peptides (9Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Several ER-resident proteins with sequence similarity to PDI have been identified, including ERp57 (also known as GRP58), P5 (CaBP1), PDIp (pancreatic PDI), ERp72 (CaBP2), and PDIR (PDI-related) (8Ferrari D.M. Soling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Although structural information is not yet available for these PDI-like proteins, their domain composition can be predicted on the basis of their sequence similarities. ERp57 and PDIp share a similar domain organization of a-b-b′-a′ with PDI, although the sequences of the b′ domains differ substantially. ERp72 and PDIR harbor three Trx-related domains. Each Trx-like domain of PDIR contains a different active site sequence (CSMC, CGHC, or CPHC), with each motif possibly being optimal for different substrates. These findings suggest that PDI-like proteins perform a similar function but possess distinct substrate binding properties. Additional PDI family members have been identified in the human genome data base, and two PDI-like proteins, ERp28 and ERp44, have been found not to contain the CXXC motif (10Fassio A. Sitia R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 12Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). This diversity of PDI-like proteins suggests that these proteins possess various substrate specificities and are probably required for disulfide bond formation and correct protein folding in the ER. Rearrangement of disulfide bonds is also required for efficient protein folding, and the reduction of such bonds in misfolded proteins is necessary for quality control of this process in the ER (10Fassio A. Sitia R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER results in three cellular responses: (i) transcriptional induction of molecular chaperones, such as BiP (GRP78), and folding enzymes, such as PDI, via a signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response; (ii) attenuation of translation; and (iii) ER-associated degradation of misfolded proteins (11Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is induced if these stress responses are unable to rescue the affected cells (12Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Caspase-12, which is localized on the outer membrane of the ER and is processed by calpain in response to ER stress, mediates such apoptosis (13Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar, 14Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar) by activating caspase-9 in a cytochrome c-independent manner (15Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In parallel with caspase-12 activation, ER stress triggers the activation of caspase-8, resulting in cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation via Bid processing (16Jimbo A. Fujita E. Kouroku Y. Ohnishi J. Inohara N. Kuida K. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Momoi T. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Both of these caspase cascades converge on caspase-3, the active form of which mediates the degradation of many apoptotic substrates, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (17Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). However, the function of caspase-12 in human cells is questionable, because those cells are known to express either a truncated protein or a full-length protein with no catalytic activity (18Fischer H. Koenig U. Eckhart L. Tschachler E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 19Saleh M. Vaillancourt J.P. Graham R.K. Huyck M. Srinivasula S.M.

We have now characterized a novel ER-resident protein, ERp16, that possesses a single Trx-like domain with an atypical active site sequence, CGAC, that has not been detected in other Trx-like proteins. Its biochemical properties suggest that ERp16 may function as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase that is required for correct disulfide bond formation in the ER. Furthermore, the effects of overexpression or depletion of ERp16 on ER stress-induced apoptosis suggest that this protein plays an important role in cellular defense against prolonged ER stress. Reagents and Antibodies—Ribonuclease (RNase) A, cytidine 2′,3′-monophosphate, insulin, and dithiothreitol as well as GSH and GSSG were obtained from Sigma; bovine liver PDI, NADPH, brefeldin A, and tunicamycin were from Calbiochem; the fluorogenic caspase substrate DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) was from BD Biosciences; and propidium iodide was from Molecular Probes. Rabbit antiserum to ERp16 was generated in response to injection of a purified glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of human ERp16 according to standard procedures. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to PDI, to BiP (GRP78), and to PARP were obtained from BD Biosciences, and monoclonal antibodies to lamin B, to β-actin, and to α-tubulin were from Calbiochem, Abcam, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Purification of ERp16 from Mouse Liver and NH2-terminal Sequence Determination—An ER-enriched fraction was prepared from the liver of male C57BL/6 mice as described previously (21Amar-Costesec A. Beaufay H. Wibo M. Thines-Sempoux D. Feytmans E. Robbi M. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The ER pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and 0.5% Triton X-100, and the suspension was maintained on ice for 20 min before centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Saturated ammonium sulfate solution was slowly added to the resulting supernatant on ice until the concentration reached 1 m, after which the precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min to a TSK Phenyl-5PW 7.5/7.5 column (Tosoh Bioscience) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 m ammonium sulfate. Proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 1 to 0 m over 120 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The fractions corresponding to the peak of ERp16 immunoreactivity were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA. The dialyzed proteins were applied to a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.8 m over 100 min at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The fractions corresponding to the peak of ERp16 immunoreactivity were pooled. All chromatography was performed at 4 °C. For NH2-terminal sequencing, the protein preparation was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was stained with Ponceau S (Sigma), and the band corresponding to ERp16 was subjected to automated Edman sequencing with the use of a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 491 protein sequencer at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Seoul, Korea). Cloning and Mutagenesis of Human ERp16—The DNA sequence encoding mature human ERp16 (amino acids 27-172) was amplified by PCR from human colon cDNA (Clontech) with a forward primer (5′-ACGCCTCATATGCATAATGGGCTTGGAAAGGGTTTTG-3′) containing both an NdeI site (underlined) and the initiation codon (boldface type) and with a reverse primer (5′-GCCTCGAGTTACAATTCATCTTCAAGATGTTTC-3′) containing both a XhoI site (underlined) and the stop codon (boldface type). The amplification product was cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-17b (Novagen) for expression in Escherichia coli. For expression of a GST-ERp16 fusion protein, the ERp16 cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Three ERp16 mutant proteins (C66S, C69S, and CS in which Cys66, Cys69, or both cysteine residues were replaced by serine, respectively) were generated with the use of a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with complementary primers containing a 1-bp mismatch that converts the codon for cysteine to one for serine. The ERp16 cDNA was also cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells. Purification of Recombinant ERp16—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET-17b encoding mature human ERp16 was cultured at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm when the optical density of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.5-0.6. After incubation for an additional 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -70 °C until use. The frozen cells were suspended in an ice-cold solution containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride and were then disrupted by ultrasonic treatment. After removal of nucleic acid from the cell lysate with streptomycin sulfate, the remaining proteins were precipitated by the slow addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation at 4 °C and were then dissolved in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 m ammonium sulfate. Debris was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was subjected to sequential high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on TSK Phenyl-5PW 21.5/15 (Tosoh Bioscience) and Mono-Q HR 10/10 (Amersham Biosciences) columns. The chromatographic procedures were similar to those described above for the purification of ERp16 from mouse liver with the exception that the flow rates for the two columns were 5 and 2 ml/min, respectively. The fractions of the Mono-Q HR column corresponding to the peak of ERp16 were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0). The GST-ERp16 fusion protein was purified from E. coli transformed with the corresponding pGEX4T-1 vector by chromatography on GSH-Sepharose resin and was then digested with thrombin at 4 °C. The GST moiety was removed by chromatography on a GSH-Sepharose column, and ERp16 was further purified with the use of a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column. Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells cultured on glass coverslips were transfected with pCMV/Myc/ER/GFP (Invitrogen). After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and then immediately washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. They were exposed to blocking solution (10% fetal bovine serum and 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with antibodies to ERp16 in blocking solution containing 0.2% saponin. After three washes with blocking solution, the cells were incubated for 1 h with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin G (Sigma) and then washed an additional three times with blocking solution. The coverslips were mounted on slide glasses with the use of the SlowFade antifade kit (Molecular Probes), and the cells were examined with a laser-scanning confocal microscope system (Zeiss LSM 510). Determination of Redox Potential—The reduced form of recombinant mature human ERp16 (1 μm) was incubated for 16 h at 25 °C in a solution containing 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm GSSG, and various concentrations (10 μm to 10 mm) of GSH. Oxidation by air was prevented by degassing the filtered buffer and subsequent flushing with nitrogen as well as by incubation of the protein samples in an anaerobic chamber. The redox state of ERp16 in the glutathione redox buffers was monitored as the change in fluorescence intensity at 335 nm (excitation wavelength of 285 nm). The redox potential of ERp16 was calculated from the equilibrium constant with glutathione and a value of -240 mV for the standard redox potential of the GSH-GSSG redox couple (22Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Fold Des. 1998; 3: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Determination of pKa Values of Thiol Groups—The thiolate ion has a higher absorbance at 240 nm, with an extinction coefficient (ϵ240) of ∼4000 m-1 cm-1, than does the unionized thiol group (23Graminski G.F. Kubo Y. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3562-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The pKa values of thiol groups can therefore be determined by monitoring UV absorbance during pH titration. The pH of a solution containing 100 μm recombinant mature human ERp16 was titrated within the range of 3-9 by the addition of HCl or NaOH, and A240 was measured. For measurement of only thiolate-dependent A240, the absorbance of a double cysteine mutant of ERp16 (ERp16-CS) was subtracted. The pH-dependent change in ϵ240 was fitted according to the Henderson-Hasselbach equation to obtain the pKa values of the thiol groups. Preparation of Reduced, Denatured RNase A or Scrambled RNase A—Reduced, denatured RNase A was prepared by incubating the native enzyme overnight at room temperature in a solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and 1 mm EDTA. The reduced, denatured enzyme was separated from dithiothreitol and guanidine hydrochloride by chromatography on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 10 mm HCl. The RNase A fractions were stored under anaerobic conditions. Scrambled RNase A was prepared by allowing the reduced enzyme to undergo reoxidation under denaturing conditions as described previously (24Hawkins H.C. Blackburn E.C. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Depletion of ERp16 by RNA Interference—A small interfering RNA that targets human ERp16 mRNA was based on nucleotides 40-58 relative to the translation start site (GGCTTCAGTTTCCTGCTCC). The small interfering RNA was synthesized with the use of T7 RNA polymerase (25Donze O. Picard D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and was introduced into HeLa cells as described previously (26Jeong W. Chang T.S. Boja E.S. Fales H.M. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3151-3159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Identification and NH2-terminal Sequencing of ERp16—A search of the Conserved Domain Data base with the human Trx1 sequence and with the use of the reverse position-specific BLAST program identified a Trx-like protein (GenBank™ accession number AAH08953; also represented as AAH01493, AAD20035, NP_056997, and AAN34781). A human BLAST search for this protein yielded the clone 24952 mRNA sequence (accession number AF131758), which consists of an open reading frame of 516 bp, a 5′-untranslated region of 110 bp including an in-frame stop codon (TAG), and a 3′-untranslated region containing a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA). The predicted open reading frame encodes a protein of 172 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 19.2 kDa. Although this protein has been described previously with three different names (ERp19, ERp18, and hTLP19), it was renamed ERp16, as described below. ERp19 was identified as a new ER protein during mass spectral analysis of ER proteins from mouse liver (27Knoblach B. Keller B.O. Groenendyk J. Aldred S. Zheng J. Lemire B.D. Li L. Michalak M. Mol.

Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of human and mouse ERp16 is shown in Fig. 1A. Both proteins contain a putative NH2-terminal signal sequence and COOH-terminal ER retention motif (EDEL and QDEL in the human and mouse proteins, respectively). Prediction of the NH2-terminal amino acid of the mature ERp16 protein by the PSORT and SignalP programs was not conclusive, with the former identifying Ser24 as the NH2-terminal residue of the human protein and the latter identifying His27 (28Alanen H.I. Williamson R.A. Howard M.J. Lappi A.K. Jantti H.P. Rautio S.M. Kellokumpu S. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol.

Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar). This ambiguous prediction of the cleavage site led the three previous groups that identified ERp16 to prepare recombinant proteins with different NH2 termini and sizes: a 149-residue human protein (Ser24-Leu172) (28Alanen H.I. Williamson R.A. Howard M.J. Lappi A.K. Jantti H.P. Rautio S.M. Kellokumpu S. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 2003; 315: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine the NH2-terminal sequence of mature ERp16 unambiguously, we purified the protein from an ER fraction of mouse liver by two HPLC steps (Fig. 1B). The protein preparation was further fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the band corresponding to ERp16 was excised and subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing. The first five residues were determined to be RTGLG (data not shown), indicating that the cleavage site is located between positions 24 and 25 of the mouse sequence, corresponding to positions 26 and 27 of the human sequence. The molecular mass of the predicted mature human protein (amino acids 27-172) was thus calculated to be 16.4 kDa. We therefore renamed this protein ERp16. It possesses a Trx-like domain with a putative active site sequence, CGAC, that has not been previously detected in Trx family members. A BLAST homology search yielded several ERp16 orthologs, multiple sequence alignment of which revealed that the CGAC motif is completely conserved (28Alanen H.I. Williamson R.A. Howard M.J. Lappi A.K. Jantti H.P. Rautio S.M. Kellokumpu S. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28912-28920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Total soluble fractions prepared from rat tissues and cultured human cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to ERp16. ERp16 was detected in most of the tissues examined, being especially abundant in testis, lung, uterus, heart, thyroid, and placenta (Fig. 2A). It was also detected in all human cell lines examined (Fig. 2B). Its abundance in HeLa cells was assessed by immunoblot analysis with the use of recombinant mature human ERp16 (amino acids 27-172) as a reference (Fig. 2C). HeLa cell lysate was thus found to contain 0.15 μg of ERp16/mg of protein (0.015% of total HeLa cell proteins). Subcellular Distribution and ER Topology of ERp16—The subcellular localization of ERp16 had not been completely resolved by the previous studies (24Hawkins H.C. Blackburn E.C. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Donze O. Picard D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 26Jeong W. Chang T.S. Boja E.S. Fales H.M. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3151-3159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); ERp18 and ERp19 were found in the ER, whereas hTLP19 was shown to be a secretory protein. To determine the localization of ERp16, we fractionated HeLa cell homogenates into nuclear, organellar, plasma membrane, and cytosolic fractions. Each fraction was then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to ERp16, and successful preparation of the organellar fraction was confirmed with antibodies to PDI (Fig. 3A). ERp16 was detected predominantly in the heavy membrane fraction containing the ER, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and other organelles, suggesting that it is probably localized in the ER. The small amount of ERp16 detected in the cytosolic fraction was probably attributable to leakage from the ER during fractionation, given that a similar amount of PDI also was detected in the cytosolic fraction. To confirm the ER residency of ERp16, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with a vector for an ER-targeted form of green fluorescent protein (ER-GFP). The cells were then permeabilized and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis with antibodies to ERp16. The pattern of ERp16 immunoreactivity was typical of that for ER marker proteins (Fig. 3B). The cells expressing ER-GFP showed a similar pattern of GFP fluorescence present both surrounding the nucleus and in a network of reticular structures. Moreover, merged images showed that endogenous ERp16 colocalized with ER-GFP. These findings are thus consistent with those of subcellular fractionation. The putative ER retention sequence of human ERp16 was EDEL, whereas the conventional sequence is KDEL in mammalian cells (31Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Given that secretory proteins also reside in the ER until they are secreted, we investigated whether the EDEL sequence is able to mediate ER retention. We transfected HeLa cells with a vector for a COOH-terminal deletion mutant of human ERp16 lacking the EDEL sequence (ERp16ΔC4) an"

Deficiencies in these protective mechanisms can lead to cellular transformation and ultimately tumorigenesis. Here we focused on Rev3, the catalytic subunit of the low-fidelity DNA repair polymerase ζ. Rev3 is believed to play a role in double-strand break (DSB)-induced DNA repair by homologous recombination. In line with this hypothesis, we show the accumulation of chromatin-bound Rev3 protein in late S–G2 of untreated cells and in response to clastogenic DNA damage as well as an γ-H2AX accumulation in Rev3-depleted cells. Moreover, serine 995 of Rev3 is in vitro phosphorylated by the DSB-inducible checkpoint kinase, Chk2. Our data also disclose a significant reduction of rev3 gene expression in 74 colon carcinomas when compared to the normal adjacent tissues. This reduced expression is independent of the carcinoma stages, suggesting that the downregulation of rev3 might have occurred early during tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2001368158,"An under-agarose chemotaxis assay was used to investigate whether unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSC) that were recently characterized in human cord blood are attracted by neuronal injury in vitro. USSC migrated toward extracts of post-ischemic brain tissue of mice in which stroke had been induced. Moreover, apoptotic neurons secrete factors that strongly attracted USSC, whereas necrotic and healthy neurons did not. Investigating the expression of growth factors and chemokines in lesioned brain tissue and neurons and of their respective receptors in USSC revealed expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in post-ischemic brain and in apoptotic but not in necrotic neurons and of the HGF receptor c-MET in USSC. Neuronal lesion-triggered migration was observed in vitro and in vivo only when c-MET was expressed at a high level in USSC. Neutralization of the bioactivity of HGF with an antibody inhibited migration of USSC toward neuronal injury. This, together with the finding that human recombinant HGF attracts USSC, document that HGF signaling is necessary for the tropism of USSC for neuronal injury. Our data demonstrate that USSC have the capacity to migrate toward apoptotic neurons and injured brain. Together with their neural differentiation potential, this suggests a neuroregenerative potential of USSC. Moreover, we provide evidence for a hitherto unrecognized pivotal role of the HGF/c-MET axis in guiding stem cells toward brain injury, which may partly account for the capability of HGF to improve function in the diseased central nervous system."

PKR participates in different signaling pathways in response to various stimuli to regulate translation via phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha, and transcription via activating NF-kappaB and IRF-1, to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here we show PKR regulates interleukin-10 induction in response to double-stranded RNA, bacterial lipopolysaccaride, and Sendai virus infection. Using chemical inhibitors, dominant negative constructs, and genetic knockouts, we demonstrate that the PKR-mediated interleukin-10 induction engages JNK and NF-kappaB.

Here, we report that Kalirin9, a dual RhoGEF, binds p75 directly and regulates p75-Nogo receptor-dependent RhoA activation and neurite inhibition in response to myelin-associated glycoprotein. The region of p75 that Kalirin9 binds includes its mastoparan-like fifth helix, which was shown to recruit RhoGDI-RhoA. As predicted from the presence of a shared binding site, we found that Kalirin9 competes with RhoGDI for p75 binding in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In line with these data, myelin-associated glycoprotein addition to cerebellar granule neurons resulted in a reduction in the association of Kalirin9 with p75, and a simultaneous increase in the binding of RhoGDI to p75.

When the Nogo receptor (NgR) was cloned using the Nogo-66 domain, which is exposed on the surface of oligodendrocytes (6GrandPre T. Nakamura F. Vartanian T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), it was evident that NgR would require a coreceptor to signal, because NgR is tethered to the membrane via glycosyl phosphatidylinositol linkage (7Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). p75 soon emerged as a coreceptor for NgR (8Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z.

RhoA is recruited to p75 via RhoGDI that binds p75 directly, and the recruited RhoA is then released and activated by unknown means. Because p75 does not contain a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) domain, the mechanism by which the recruited RhoA becomes activated has remained undetermined. Here, we present data indicating that Kalirin9, a dual RhoGEF, is one of the key components of the signaling unit for RhoA activation by myelin inhibitory molecules. Kalirins are mammalian orthologs of Trio in Drosophila and Unc73, which were shown to play a critical role in axon guidance in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans (13Bateman J. Shu H. Van Vactor D.

In the mammalian nervous system, several Kalirin isoforms are known to date, including Kalirin5, 7, 8, 9, and 12 (17Hansel D.E. Quinones M.E. Ronnett G.V. Eipper B.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These isoforms all contain Rac GEF, but only Kalirin9 and 12 additionally contain RhoGEF, like Trio. Kalirin12 contains a kinase-like domain in addition to Rac and RhoA GEF domains, but its kinase activity has not yet been characterized. Kalirin9 was shown to promote axon outgrowth during development, (18Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8426-8434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), being the predominant form expressed (17Hansel D.E. Quinones M.E. Ronnett G.V. Eipper B.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As its role in axon outgrowth suggests, Kalirin9 is localized to growth cones and neurites in neuronal cultures (18Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8426-8434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Trio dual RhoGEFs have been shown to play critical roles in axon outgrowth, the extracellular factors or receptors that regulate the actions of the Kalirins are not known. It was reported that EphrinB and its receptor, EphB2, regulates Kalirin7-dependent Rac activation at synaptic sites (19Penzes P. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 2003; 37: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), but Kalirin7 is not a dual GEF and is localized to post-synaptic compartments, unlike the other members of the family. Recently, Kalirin5 was shown to interact with TrkA and play a role in nerve growth factor-dependent neurite extension in PC12 cells, presumably by activating Rac (20Chakrabarti K. Lin R. Schiller N.I. Wang Y. Koubi D. Fan Y.X. Rudkin B.B. Johnson G.R. Schiller M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5106-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Whether nerve growth factor signaling modulates Kalirin5-mediated Rac activation was, however, not clear. Here, we present evidence that MAG serves as a ligand that induces Kalirin9 to activate RhoA via p75-NgR. Kalirin9 binding to p75 is regulated by MAG, and knocking down endogenous Kalirin9 results in inhibition of MAG-mediated RhoA activity and its attendant effect on neurite outgrowth. Constructs—The constructs carrying the m1–m6 regions in Kalirin9 were generated by placing the PCR fragment corresponding to each region into the pcDNA4/HisMax TOPO TA kit (Invitrogen). The PCR fragments were generated using pEAK-Kalirin9 (18Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8426-8434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the template and subsequently sequenced for any errors. The pTYB12-RhoGDI was generated by placing the PCR fragment of RhoGDI with appropriate linker sequences as directed by the vendor (NE BioLabs). The final product was sequenced for any errors. RhoGDI protein was produced in the ER2566 host and purified from the inteinchitin binding protein tag using the chitin column according the protocols provided by the vendor (NE BioLabs). Primary Neuronal Cultures—CGN cultures were prepared as described (8Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). For transfection of small interfering RNA constructs, CGNs were transfected right after dissection with 3 μg of small interfering RNA plus GFP cDNA using the G13 program of Amaxa Nucleofactor. Rho-GTP assays were performed 2 days after transfection. The sequence for the RNAi for Kalirin9 was 6134AGUACCAGCUGCUACUCAA6152, that for Kalirin7 was 4902GGAUGGCAACCUUGUUCCU4920, and for the scrambled control, the sequence was CCAGGAUAACACAGAGAUG, all of which were synthesized by Dharmacon. GST Pulldown Assays—The m1–m6 proteins were harvested from 293T cells following transfection. For pulldown analyses, the 293T lysates containing m1–m6 fragments were incubated with GST or GST-p75ICD proteins, and the bound m1–m6 fragments were detected with Xpress antibody in Western assays. For in vitro competition with RhoGDI, m1–m5 fragments were purified from 293T cells using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen). The purified m1–m5 fragments were incubated with GST or GST-p75ICD in the presence of increasing amounts of RhoGDI, which was obtained following dithiothreitol treatment of intein-RhoGDI that was loaded onto a chitin column. For competition assays shown in Fig. 3C, 1 μg of m2 and m5 fragments were bound to 10 μg of GST-p75ICD in the presence of 0, 1.8, 5.4, and 16.2 μg of purified RhoGDI. For GST binding of m2 and m5 fragments, 10 μg of GST was used as well. The kalirin fragments (m1 to m6) that had bound to GST or GST-p75ICD were detected using Xpress antibody. Rho-GTP Measurements—To measure Rho-GTP, the CGN cultures were treated for 15 min with 0.3 μg/ml of conjugated MAG-Fc (Sigma) and 8 μg/ml conjugated AP-Nogo-66. The pulldown reactions with GST-Rhotekin beads were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotech Inc.). Neurite Outgrowth Assay—Neurite outgrowth assays were performed as described previously (3Wang K.C. Koprivica V. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Guo Y. Neve R.L. He Z. Nature. 2002; 417: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 8Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). For quantification of average neurite length, the lengths of GFP+ neurites were measured on at least 150 neurons/condition, from three independent experiments. Immunoprecipitation/Western Analyses—The procedures for immunoprecipitation and Western analyses were identical to what was described (21Yoon S.O. Soltoff S.P. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23231-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The antibodies used in these assays include p75, hemagglutinin (Covance), Nogo receptor (Chemicon), Myc (Santa Cruz), pan-Kalirin antibody (18Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8426-8434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RhoA, RhoGDI (Sigma), and Xpress (Invitrogen). Kalirin9 and 12 Bind p75 in Vitro—Several GEF molecules have been implicated in nerve growth factor-dependent regulation of small G proteins, such as Trio (22Estrach S. Schmidt S. Diriong S. Penna A.

Matsuda M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 843-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and p85 betaPIX (24Shin E.Y. Woo K.N. Lee C.S. Koo S.H. Kim Y.G. Kim W.J. Bae C.D. Chang S.I. Kim E.G.

Of these, the Kalirin family of dual RhoGEFs was of special interest for p75-mediated, and TrkA-independent regulation of Rac1 and RhoA, because p75 can activate these GTPases depending on with which receptor it has become associated. We therefore tested whether Kalirin9 and 12 that contain both RhoGEF and RacGEF domains (17Hansel D.E. Quinones M.E. Ronnett G.V. Eipper B.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) can interact with p75 in vitro using pull-down assays with GST-p75ICD. The 293T lysates that contained the full-length, Myc-tagged Kalirin9 or 12 were incubated with the GST or GST-p75 intracellular domain (GST-p75ICD). Both Kalirin9 and 12 were pulled down with the GST-p75ICD but not with the GST (Fig. 1A), suggesting that both kalirins can bind the cytoplasmic domain of p75 in vitro. Kalirin9 Is in Complex with p75-NgR in Vivo—We next asked whether Kalirins are expressed in p75+ neurons in vivo. Immunohistochemical analyses of postnatal day 5 (P5) rat cerebellum with pan-Kalirin antibody revealed that Kalirin is expressed among developing Purkinje cells, including their axons and dendrites (Fig. 1B). The positive immunoreactive signals in the cerebellum are likely to represent Kalirin9 and 12, because they are the predominant isoforms detected in the cerebellar lysates from P1 and P5, based on the expected size, 350 kDa for Kalirin9 and 450 kDa for Kalirin12 (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1). The specificity of the Kalirin antibody is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. More importantly, both Kalirins were expressed in cerebellar granule neurons (see CGN in Fig. 1D), in which p75 was shown to regulate RhoA activation in response to myelin inhibitory molecules (8Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 10Yamashita T. Higuchi H. Tohyama M. J.

It should be pointed out, however, that Kalirin12 expression is extremely low in CGN cultures compared with that of Kalirin9, suggesting that Kalirin9, and not Kalirin12, is likely to be the GEF that is involved in RhoA activation by myelin inhibitory molecules. We next asked whether both Kalirin9 and 12 interact with p75-NgR complex in vivo. The cerebellar lysates from P5 rats were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the control IgG or MC192, an anti-p75 antibody. The resulting p75 immune complexes were separated and probed for both Kalirin and NgR by dividing the membrane into two parts and then using one for Kalirin and the other for NgR in Western analyses. As a control, the same blot was stripped and reprobed for p75. A Kalirin-immunoreactive band was detected in the p75 immune complex at the size corresponding to Kalirin9 and not Kalirin12 (Fig. 1C). Also, in reciprocal immunoprecipitation with NgR antibody, p75 was present along with Kalirin9, but not with Kalirin12 (Fig. 1C). Neither Kalirin9 nor NgR was detected in the control IgG immunoprecipitation. These results suggest that Kalirin9 is the isoform that forms a complex with p75-NgR in vivo and may play a role in p75-NgR signaling. Two Distinct Domains in Kalirin9 Are Involved in Binding p75—We next determined which domains in Kalirin9 are involved in the interaction with p75. For these experiments, the constructs containing the m1–m6 regions of Kalirin9 depicted in Fig. 2A were introduced into 293T cells, and the resulting lysates were subjected to pulldown assays with GST or GST-p75ICD. Of the six regions tested, two domains interacted with p75ICD; m2, which contains the most of the spectrin-like repeats of Kalirin9; and m5, which contains the SH3 domain plus the sequences before the Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains begin (Fig. 2). The binding of the m2 and m5 domains to p75 was direct (Fig. 3C), because the purified m2 and m5 from 293T lysates also interacted with p75 in vitro, suggesting that it is likely that both domains are involved in forming a complex with p75. This may be regarded as atypical, in that two widely separated domains in Kalirin9 are jointly interacting with p75. It is highly plausible, however, that the m2 and m5 domains are structurally juxtaposed in folded, native proteins, and thereby concurrently accessible to the C termini of p75. It should also be pointed out that the same region in hTrio, that is, the N-terminal half of the spectrin-like repeats in hTrio, was shown to be critical in eliciting neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (22Estrach S. Schmidt S. Diriong S. Penna A. Blangy A. Fort P. Debant A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 307-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A recent study reported that the SH3 domain of Kalirin9 interacts with Crk (25Schiller M.R. Chakrabarti K. King G.F. Schiller N.I. Eipper B.A. Maciejewski M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18774-18786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When bound to Crk, Kalirin9 failed to activate Rac, suggesting that Crk binding to Kalirin9 via its SH3 domain inhibits its GEF activity. It may then be reasonable to extrapolate that the binding of p75 through the SH3 domain of Kalirin9 is also likely to result in inhibition of its GEF activity. Concordantly, when released, Kalirin9 would be likely to regain its GEF activity. Kalirin9 and RhoGDI Compete for p75ICD Binding in Vitro—It was reported that RhoGDI-RhoA binds p75 via its mastoparan-like fifth helix, which has the ability to facilitate the release of RhoA when it is bound to RhoGDI (12Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). If Kalirin9 is the GEF responsible for the subsequent GDP/GTP exchange reaction, we may expect that Kalirin9 will bind near helix 5 of p75. We therefore tested where the m2 and m5 domains bind p75 using a series of nested deletion constructs (Fig. 3A). Upon deleting the fourth helix, both the m2 and m5 fragments failed to bind p75, suggesting that helix 4 is necessary for m2 and m5 to bind p75 (Fig. 3B). The modes of binding appear somewhat different between m2 and m5, however; helices 5 and 6 appear to augment the binding of m5 to p75 significantly, but they had only a minor effect on the binding of m2 to p75 (Fig. 3B). The result that Kalirin9 binding to p75 is enhanced by helices 5 and 6, at least with the m5 domain, suggests that Kalirin9 may compete with RhoGDI-RhoA for p75 binding. This hypothesis was next tested entirely in vitro, using the purified m2 and m5 and GST-p75ICD in the presence of increasing amounts of RhoGDI that was purified from bacteria. In these assays, the binding of m2 and m5 to p75ICD was competed by the presence of RhoGDI in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). These in vitro results thus suggest that Kalirin9 and RhoGDI may not bind p75 at the same time and that their binding may be mutually exclusive. The reciprocal interaction between Kalirin9 and RhoGDI in p75 binding was further tested using the full-length recombinant Kalirin9 construct in 293T cells. FLAG-NgR was detected in the p75 immune complex when cells were transfected with hemagglutinin-p75 and FLAG-NgR (Fig. 3D, lane 1), which is in agreement with previous reports (8Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 9Wong S.T. Henley J.R. Kanning K.C. Huang K.H. Bothwell M. Poo M.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Similarly, Kalirin9 interacted with p75 (Fig. 3D, lane 2) as in Fig. 1. When NgR was cotransfected along with p75 and Kalirin9, however, Kalirin9 dissociated from p75 to the background level (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that association between p75 and NgR facilitates the dissociation of Kalirin9 from p75. We next asked whether the presence of RhoGDI modulates the full-length Kalirin9 binding to p75 in 293T cells. For these experiments, the lysates were equally divided to produce three identical immunoprecipitation reactions with a p75 antibody, and then each was probed in Western assay for Myc-RhoGDI, RhoA, or Myc-Kalirin9. In the absence of Kalirin9, RhoGDI interacted with p75, and this interaction brought RhoA to p75 (Fig. 3E, lane 1), which is in agreement with the previous report (12Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). When Kalirin9 was introduced, on the other hand, the amount of Myc-RhoGDI bound to p75 was significantly reduced compared with that without Kalirin9, which also correlated with the loss of RhoA from p75 (Fig. 3E, lane 3). Together, these results suggest that Kalirin9 and RhoGDI compete for p75 binding. Such mutually exclusive binding behavior can be interpreted as suggesting that Kalirin9 may participate in the release of RhoA from p75 after RhoA is recruited to p75 via RhoGDI. Kalirin9 Dissociates from p75-NgR following MAG Activation—Yamashita and Tohyama (12Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) reported that MAG-Fc treatment facilitates RhoGDI-RhoA recruitment to p75-NgR complex in CGN cultures. We therefore tested whether RhoGDI indeed competes for p75 binding with Kalirin9 after MAG activation using CGN cultures. Neonatal CGN cultures are known to respond to all known NgR ligands that activate RhoA in a manner dependent on p75-NgR (8Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 9Wong S.T. Henley J.R. Kanning K.C. Huang K.H. Bothwell M. Poo M.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 10Yamashita T. Higuchi H. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 26Mi S. Lee X. Shao Z. Thill G. Ji B. Relton J. Levesque M. Allaire N. Perrin S. Sands B. Crowell T. Cate R.L. McCoy J.M. Pepinsky R.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Also in our P5–6 neonatal rat CGN cultures, the addition of MAG-Fc resulted in RhoA activation (Fig. 4A, lower panels). After treating CGN cultures with or without MAG, the resulting lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation reactions using anti-p75 antibody or the control IgG. Following Western analysis, the blot was divided into two parts, and each was probed for the endogenous Kalirin9 or RhoGDI. As a control, the blot was stripped and reprobed for NgR and p75. We found that Kalirin9 was bound to p75 in the basal state, but the amount of Kalirin9 that associated with p75 decreased by 60% after MAG-Fc treatment (Fig. 4, A, upper panels, and B, for quantification). The amount of RhoGDI that associated with p75 increased with MAG-Fc, as reported (12Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A and C, for quantification). The control IgG did not bring down any proteins. These results together suggest that MAG-dependent recruitment of RhoGDI-RhoA to p75 coincides with dissociation of Kalirin9 in a reciprocal manner. In this reciprocal interaction between Kalirin9 and RhoGDI-RhoA, we envision that the dissociating Kalirin9 binds RhoA that was brought to p75 by RhoGDI following MAG activation. Because RhoA binding to RhoGEF is likely to be too fast and transient to detect in immunoprecipitation assays, we opted instead to ask whether Kalirin9 binds GDP or GTP-bound form of RhoA. If Kalirin9 were to activate RhoA by facilitating GDP to GTP exchange reaction on the bound RhoA after it is released from RhoGDI, Kalirin9 will bind the GDP-bound form specifically. Indeed, Kalirin9 bound Rho-GDP and not Rho-GTP, whereas RhoGDI bound both GTP and the GDP-bound form of RhoA (Fig. 4D). In these experiments, we preloaded 293T lysates with either GDP or unhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS and subjected the lysates to immunoprecipitation reactions with Kalirin9 or RhoGDI antibodies. The control Rho-GTP assay of the same lysates shows that the preloading was complete, because Rho-GTP was detected only in GTPγS samples and not in GDP samples. These results together suggest that activation of RhoA by p75-NgR includes Kalirin9, whose action is likely to bind RhoA-GDP after it is released from the activated p75-NgR complex and facilitate the GDP to GTP exchange reactions. Kalirin9 Is Involved in RhoA Activation by p75-NgR—We next examined whether Kalirin9 is necessary for RhoA activation by myelin inhibitory molecules using RNAi to knock down the endogenous Kalirin9. As controls, an RNAi with scrambled sequences of Kalirin9 RNAi was used as well as an RNAi for Kalirin7, an alternatively spliced isoform of Kalirin9. In scrambled-RNAi and Kalirin7-RNAi transfected cultures, both MAG (Ma) and Nogo-66 (N) activated RhoA, whereas they failed to do so when the cultures were transfected with Kalirin9-RNAi (Fig. 5; p < 0.01). In Kalirin9-RNAi cultures, the overall Kalirin9 protein levels were reduced significantly, whereas in the control-RNAi and Kalirin7-RNAi cultures, they were not (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that Kalirin9 is necessary for ligand-dependent RhoA activation in CGN cultures. It should be pointed out that the sequences that we used to knock down Kalirin9 in Fig. 5 are derived from the RhoGEF domain (6134–6152 in nucleotide sequences), suggesting that the Kalirin9-RNAi can potentially target Kalirin12 that contains the same sequences. Although Kalirin12 did not interact with p75 in the cerebellum, making it unlikely that it plays a role, we thought it was important to determine whether it was Kalirin9 or Kalirin12 that is involved in RhoA activation by MAG-Fc in these cultures. Unfortunately, Kalirin12 levels are extremely low in CGN cultures (Fig. 1D), rendering it very difficult for us to use RNAi-based knockdown approaches effectively, even with several different sets of RNAi that were unique to Kalirin12 (data not shown). We therefore decided to test whether Kalirin9 or Kalirin12 is sufficient to allow RhoA activation in response to myelin inhibitory molecules using an ectopic system, such as 293T cells, as was reported (26Mi S. Lee X. Shao Z. Thill G. Ji B. Relton J. Levesque M. Allaire N. Perrin S. Sands B. Crowell T. Cate R.L. McCoy J.M. Pepinsky R.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). 293T cells were therefore transfected with p75/NgR, p75/NgR/Kalirin9, or p75/NgR/Kalirin12. Following 30-min treatments with MAG-Fc (Ma), there was 1.5-fold increase in RhoA-GTP levels when Kalirin9 was introduced, but not when Kalirin12 was (Fig. 6). The relative expression levels of transfected constructs were similar in each set of transfections, based on control Western assay (Fig. 6A, Input). Because the introduction of p75 with NgR alone failed to activate RhoA in these cells, these data suggest that Kalirin9 and not Kalirin12 constitutes the missing component in the RhoA activation machinery of the p75-NgR complex in response to MAG-Fc. Kalirin9 Is Required for Neurite Inhibition by Myelin Inhibitory Molecules in CGN Cultures—If Kalirin9 activates RhoA in response to myelin inhibitory molecules, knocking down Kalirin9 should allow neurons to continue extending processes even when they are plated onto myelin. To address this question, the RNAi duplexes were introduced along with a GFP construct into CGN cultures, and the lengths of the subsequently grown neurites were measured among GFP+ neurons. All of the transfected neurons sent out long neurites on a permissive substrate, poly-d-lysine, regardless of the RNAi introduced, indicating that RNAi duplexes did not perturb the normal process outgrowth on permissive substrates (Fig. 7A). On myelin substrates, however, both the control-RNAi and Kalirin7-RNAi expressing neurons failed to extend neurites, whereas Kalirin9-RNAi expressing neurons continued to send out processes as they did on poly-d-lysine (Fig. 7; **, p < 0.001). These data suggest that Kalirin9 is indeed involved in p75-NgR-dependent RhoA activation and inhibition of neurite outgrowth. In this report, we present data that support a functional role for Kalirin9, a Trio family of a dual Rac and RhoGEF in p75-NgR signaling; Kalirin9 binds p75 through its helices 4–6, and this binding appears to exclude RhoGDI binding to p75 via its helix 5 region. Functionally, knocking down Kalirin9 protein levels in CGN cultures resulted in inhibition of RhoA activation and continued neurite outgrowth on myelin substrates. Together, these data suggest that Kalirin9 is a GEF that plays a role in the activation of RhoA by the p75-NgR complex. We believe that Kalirin9 dissociates from p75 as a result of competition with RhoGDI-RhoA that is being recruited to p75 upon MAG activation. It is possible, however, that dissociation is simply a result of p75 being cleaved by γ-secretase after MAG treatment. Cleavage of p75 by γ-secretase was recently shown to be necessary for RhoA activation by MAG (27Domeniconi M. Zampieri N. Spencer T. Hilaire M. Mellado W. Chao M.V. Filbin M.T. Neuron. 2005; 46: 849-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We believe this latter scenario is highly unlikely based on two observations. One, Kalirin9 can bind GST-p75ICD. Two, the proportion of cleaved p75ICD to the full-length form is relatively small, whereas the extent of reduction in Kalirin9 bound to p75 is much greater after MAG treatment in CGN cultures. Alternatively, it is possible that dissociation of 350 kDa Kalirin9 from p75 allows γ-secretase complex to access p75-NgR. Kalirin9 is a dual RhoGEF, containing both RacGEF and RhoGEF domains, suggesting that it can potentially activate Rac1 and RhoA simultaneously. When overexpressed in fibroblasts, the RacGEF domain alone induced lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, whereas overexpression of the full-length Kalirin9 failed to exhibit prominent membrane ruffles, although lamellipodia production increased along with increased production of stress fibers (18Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8426-8434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the RacGEF domain is functional, but its activity may be modulated in the context of the full-length protein when appropriate signals are received. Overexpression of Kalirin9 in neuronal cultures led to a similar conclusion, suggesting that although each GEF domain in isolation acts as a RacGEF and RhoGEF, there may be cross-talk between the two GEF domains in the context of a full-length protein, thereby eliciting a coordinated response that differs from an arithmetic sum of individual activities (18Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8426-8434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of whether both GEF domains are responsible for RhoA activation will thus have to rely on mutant constructs that bear deletion of each GEF domain. In regard to myelin inhibitory molecules that signal through p75-NgR coreceptors, we believe that Rac1 activation is unlikely to play critical roles. A major reason is that our unpublished data indicate that neurotrophin-mediated Rac1 activation by p75 is dependent on Kalirin7, and not Kalirin9. In addition, we found that RacGTP levels are concentrated in membrane-rich compartments of the cerebellum, whereas RhoGTP levels are not. 3A. W. Harrington and S. O. Yoon, unpublished data. These results suggest that the site of Rac1 activation is distinct from RhoA activation inside the cell. Indeed, Kalilrin7 is localized to membrane-rich compartments, such as postsynaptic densities (19Penzes P. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 2003; 37: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), whereas Kalirin9 is distributed widely.4 Based on these observations, we believe that Kalirin9 is not likely to be involved in activating Rac1, at least not in response to myelin inhibitory molecules. Our data suggest that Kalirin9, and not Kalirin12, is involved in RhoA activation by p75-NgR. The primary difference between the two proteins is an additional kinase domain present in Kalirin12. In hTrio, it was shown that its kinase domain was dispensable for Trio to promote neurite outgrowth (22Estrach S. Schmidt S. Diriong S. Penna A. Blangy A. Fort P. Debant A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 307-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We are not certain what prevents Kalirin12 from activating RhoA in 293T cells, but aside from the difference in kinase domains, it seems possible that a difference in cellular localization plays a role. Kalirin9 is expressed in neuritic processes in neuronal cultures, whereas Kalirin12 expression is mostly confined to the cell body (18Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8426-8434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p75 is also highly expressed in the dendritic layers as well as in developing axons of Purkinje neurons (Fig. 1). This suggests that Kalirin9 may be sequestered in the particular cellular compartment where it can interact with p75 in the neuritic processes and grow axonal endings to activate RhoA. Besides Kalirin9, Lingo-1, was previously reported to confer RhoA activation in an ectopic Cos cells, suggesting that Lingo-1 is also involved in Nogo signaling (26Mi S. Lee X. Shao Z. Thill G. Ji B. Relton J. Levesque M. Allaire N. Perrin S. Sands B. Crowell T. Cate R.L. McCoy J.M. Pepinsky R.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Lingo-1 does not bind myelin inhibitory molecules but associates with p75 and NgR in Cos cells, although in vivo interaction has not been demonstrated. The mechanism by which Lingo-1 activates RhoA has remained unclear, especially because it is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked protein without an obvious RhoGEF motif. It is possible that Lingo-1 recruits a RhoGEF that can substitute the function of Kalirin9 in ectopic cells, but in the presence of Kalirin9, Lingo-1 utilizes Kalirin9. In conclusion, we have documented that Kalirin9 is a necessary, functional component for p75-NgR signaling, thereby facilitating RhoA activation. We also identify myelin inhibitory molecules as the first known group of ligands that regulate the function of Kalirin9 in process outgrowth.

https://openalex.org/W1981698873,"Background Receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) is a versatile transcriptional co-repressor that plays roles in diverse metabolic processes including fat accumulation in adipocytes. Previously we identified three methylated arginine residues in RIP140, which rendered its export to the cytoplasm; but it was unclear what triggered RIP140 arginine methylation. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we determined the activated PKCε as the specific trigger for RIP140 arginine methylation and its subsequent export. We identified two PKCε–phosphorylated residues of RIP140, Ser-102 and Ser-1003, which synergistically stimulated direct binding of RIP140 by 14-3-3 that recruited protein arginine methyl transferase 1 to methylate RIP140. The methylated RIP140 then preferentially recruited exportin 1 for nuclear export. As a result, the nuclear gene-repressive activity of RIP140 was reduced. In RIP140 null adipocyte cultures, the defect in fat accumulation was effectively rescued by the phosphoylation-deficient mutant RIP140 that resided predominantly in the nucleus, but less so by the phospho-mimetic RIP140 that was exported to the cytoplasm. Conclusions/Significance This study uncovers a novel means, via a cascade of protein modifications, to inactivate, or suppress, the nuclear action of an important transcription coregulator RIP140, and delineates the first specific phosphorylation-arginine methylation cascade that could alter protein subcellular distribution and biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2084858623,"Background Trials of intermittent preventive treatment against malaria in infants (IPTi) using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) have shown a positive, albeit variable, protective efficacy against clinical malaria episodes. The impact of IPTi in different epidemiological settings and over time is unknown and predictions are hampered by the lack of knowledge about how IPTi works. We investigated mechanisms proposed for the action of IPTi and made predictions of the likely impact on morbidity and mortality. Methods/Principal Findings We used a comprehensive, individual-based, stochastic model of malaria epidemiology to simulate recently published trials of IPTi using SP with site-specific characteristics as inputs. This baseline model was then modified to represent hypotheses concerning the duration of action of SP, the temporal pattern of fevers caused by individual infections, potential benefits of avoiding fevers on immunity and the effect of sub-therapeutic levels of SP on parasite dynamics. The baseline model reproduced the pattern of results reasonably well. None of the models based on alternative hypotheses improved the fit between the model predictions and observed data. Predictions suggest that IPTi would have a beneficial effect across a range of transmission intensities. IPTi was predicted to avert a greater number of episodes where IPTi coverage was higher, the health system treatment coverage lower, and for drugs which were more efficacious and had longer prophylactic periods. The predicted cumulative benefits were proportionately slightly greater for severe malaria episodes and malaria-attributable mortality than for acute episodes in the settings modelled. Modest increased susceptibility was predicted between doses and following the last dose, but these were outweighed by the cumulative benefits. The impact on transmission intensity was negligible. Conclusions The pattern of trial results can be accounted for by differences between the trial sites together with known features of malaria epidemiology and the action of SP. Predictions suggest that IPTi would have a beneficial impact across a variety of epidemiological settings."
https://openalex.org/W2022509419,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in various tumours of epidermal origin and is held responsible for tumourigenicity and tumour persistence. Increased nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity has been suggested to be involved in the malignant behaviour of EGFR-overexpressing cells. However, the mechanisms that regulate EGF-induced NF-kappaB activation are still largely unknown. Here we show that EGF can induce NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression independently from IkappaBalpha degradation or p100 processing in EGFR-overexpressing HEK293T cells. Moreover, EGF-induced NF-kappaB activation could be inhibited by overexpression of ABINs, which were previously identified as intracellular inhibitors of tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-1 and lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappaB activation. Knockdown of ABIN-1 by RNA interference boosted the NF-kappaB response upon EGF stimulation. The C-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain containing region of ABINs was crucial and sufficient for NF-kappaB inhibition. Adenoviral gene transfer of ABINs reduced constitutive NF-kappaB activity as well as the proliferation of EGFR-overexpressing A431 and DU145 human carcinoma cells. Altogether, these results demonstrate an important role for an ABIN-sensitive non-classical NF-kappaB signalling pathway in the proliferation of EGFR-overexpressing tumour cells, and indicate a potential use for ABIN gene therapy in the treatment of cancer."

We asked uncircumcised respondents about willingness to be circumcised if it were proven to reduce risk of HIV among MSM and perceived barriers to circumcision. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify covariates associated with willingness to be circumcised.Of 780 MSM, 133 (17%) were uncircumcised. Of these, 71 (53%) were willing to be circumcised. Willingness was associated with black race (exact odds ratio [OR]: 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-9.8), non-injection drug use (OR: 6.1, 95% CI: 1.8-23.7) and perceived reduced risk of penile cancer (OR: 4.7, 95% CI: 2.0-11.9). The most commonly endorsed concerns about circumcision were post-surgical pain and wound infection.Over half of uncircumcised MSM, especially black MSM, expressed willingness to be circumcised.

https://openalex.org/W2143193282,"The 55-kDa TNFR1 (type I tumor necrosis factor receptor) can be released to the extracellular space by two mechanisms, the proteolytic cleavage and shedding of soluble receptor ectodomains and the release of full-length receptors within exosome-like vesicles. We have shown that the brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide exchange protein BIG2 associates with TNFR1 and selectively modulates the release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles via an ARF1- and ARF3-dependent mechanism. Here, we assessed the role of BIG2 A kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) domains in the regulation of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicle release from human vascular endothelial cells. We show that 8-bromo-cyclic AMP induced the release of full-length, 55-kDa TNFR1 within exosome-like vesicles via a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent mechanism. Using RNA interference to decrease specifically the levels of individual PKA regulatory subunits, we demonstrate that RIIβ modulates both the constitutive and cAMP-induced release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles. Consistent with its AKAP function, BIG2 was required for the cAMP-induced PKA-dependent release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles via a mechanism that involved the binding of RIIβ to BIG2 AKAP domains B and C. We conclude that both the constitutive and cAMP-induced release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles occur via PKA-dependent pathways that are regulated by the anchoring of RIIβ to BIG2 via AKAP domains B and C. Thus, BIG2 regulates TNFR1 exosome-like vesicle release by two distinct mechanisms, as a guanine nucleotide exchange protein that activates class I ADP-ribosylation factors and as an AKAP for RIIβ that localizes PKA signaling within cellular TNFR1 trafficking pathways.

Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). TNFR1, which is considered the major receptor for TNFR1 signaling and contains death domains in its intracytoplasmic tail, can be released to the extracellular space, where it binds tumor necrosis factor and modulates its bioactivity (3Wajant H.

Two distinct mechanisms regulate the release of TNFR1 to the extracellular space, proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains and the release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles. Proteolytic cleavage of the TNFR1 ectodomain, which occurs primarily in the spacer region between Asn-172 and Val-173, with a minor site between Lys-174 and Gly-175, results in the shedding of soluble receptors from the cell surface (5Engelmann H.

Tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (ADAM17) was identified as a TNFR1 sheddase based upon the finding that tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme-deficient cells have lower ratios of shed to cell surface TNFR1 than tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme-reconstituted cells (12Reddy P.

Similarly, depletion of tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme protein by RNA interference was recently reported to decrease significantly the quantity of TNFR1 released into culture medium from airway epithelial cells in response to Staphylococcus aureus protein A, which activates tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme through epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent signaling (13Gomez M.I. Seaghdha M.O. Prince A.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Full-length TNFR1 can also be released from cells to the extracellular space within the membranes of exosome-like vesicles (14Hawari F.I.

Exosomes are membrane-enclosed vesicles, which are typically 50–100 nm in diameter, that correspond to the internal vesicles of endolysosome-related multivesicular bodies and are released from cells via exocytic fusion with the plasma membrane (15Denzer K.

HUVEC-derived TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles do not contain lipid raft microdomains (14Hawari F.I. Rouhani F.N. Cui X. Yu Z.X. Buckley C. Kaler M. Levine S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, these TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles appear to be distinct from typical exosomes based upon their smaller size, lower density, and absence of lipid raft microdomains.Both the proteolytic shedding of TNFR1 ectodomains and the release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles appear to be regulated by pathways that mediate the translocation of intracytoplasmic TNFR1 vesicles. For example, stimuli, such as histamine, induced the redistribution of TNFR1 from intracellular storage pools in the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, where they can be proteolytically cleaved and shed (13Gomez M.I.

We previously described the calcium-dependent formation of a complex composed of ARTS-1 (aminopeptidase regulator of tumor necrosis factor receptor shedding), a type II integral membrane aminopeptidase, and NUCB2 (nucleobindin 2), a putative DNA- and calcium-binding protein that associated with cytoplasmic TNFR1 before its commitment to pathways resulting in either constitutive release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles or inducible proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains (26Cui X.

Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). ARF-GEPs, some of which can be inhibited by brefeldin A, contain ∼200-amino acid Sec7 domains that accelerate the exchange of ARF-GDP for GTP (29Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S.

Recently, we reported that human BIG2 (brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide exchange protein 2), a brefeldin A-inhibited ARF-GEP, regulates the constitutive release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles in an ARF1- and ARF3-dependent fashion but did not affect the inducible proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains (31Islam A. Shen X. Hiroi T. Moss J. Vaughan M. Levine S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9591-9599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The functional interaction between TNFR1 and BIG2 that mediates constitutive release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles is downstream from the ARTS-1-NUCB2 complex (31Islam A. Shen X. Hiroi T. Moss J. Vaughan M. Levine S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9591-9599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). BIG2, in addition to its role as an ARF-GEP, contains three A kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) domains that may coordinate cAMP and ARF regulatory functions (32Li H. Adamik R. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that BIG2 might regulate the release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles via its AKAP as well as its Sec7 domains. Here, we report that cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling induced TNFR1 exosome-like vesicle release via anchoring of PKA regulatory subunit RIIβ to AKAP domains B and C of BIG2. Thus, BIG2 can modulate the release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles via two distinct mechanisms, the activation of class I ARFs and cAMP-dependent PKA signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Reagents—HUVEC (passages 3 and 8) and EGM-2 medium were purchased from Cambrex BioScience (Walkersville, MD). Cell-permeable myristoylated protein kinase A inhibitor 14–22 amide (Myr-PKI) and cell-permeable ERK activation inhibitor peptide I (ERKI) were from Calbiochem. 8-Br-cAMP, 8-Br-cGMP, and H-89 were from Sigma.Antibodies—Murine IgG2b monoclonal (H5) antibody that reacted with TNFR1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), as were antibodies against β-tubulin (D10) and PKA regulatory subunits RIα (N15), RIβ (C19), RIIα (M20), and RIIβ (E20). Chicken polyclonal anti-NUCB2 antibodies were generated against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with sequence corresponding to amino acids 326–420 of the NUCB2 C-terminal leucine zipper domain (Sigma) (27Islam A.

The murine monoclonal penta-His antibody was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA).RNA Interference—Individual siGENOME RNA duplexes for BIG2; siGENOME SMARTpool RNA duplexes for the PKA regulatory subunits RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ; and siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA 1 were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). HUVEC were transfected with 100 nm siRNA using DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) for 3 days prior to performance of experiments.BIG2 Expression Plasmids—A pCMV6-XL4 mammalian expression plasmid encoding full-length human BIG2 was purchased from Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). The BIG2 cDNA clone contained seven nucleotide substitutions that differed from the ARFGEF2 reference sequence (NCBI accession number NM_006420). Among these putative polymorphisms, two represented silent mutations (C3663T and C4131T), whereas five were nonsynonymous mutations (A619G, G620A, A2884G, A3145G, and A5287G) that resulted in four amino acid replacements. As previously described, the five nonsynonymous mutations were corrected by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (31Islam A. Shen X. Hiroi T. Moss J. Vaughan M. Levine S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9591-9599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An amino-terminal His6 tag was inserted in the BIG2 plasmid using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene) and primer 5′-TTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGGGCCGCATGGGTCATCACCATCACCATCACGAATTCGCCCTTATGCAGGAGAGCCAGACC-3′). Complete sequence of the His-BIG2 plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing.BIG2 AKAP domain point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following primers: AKAP domain B (His-BIG2(V289W)), 5′-GGAGCCCAGGAGGTGTGGAAGGACATCTTGG-3′; AKAP domain C (His-BIG2(V534W)), 5′-GCTAACATTTTTGAGCGCCTTTGAAATGATTTATCCAAAATTGC-3′. Both primers were utilized to construct an expression plasmid with mutations in domains B and C (His-BIG2(V289W/V534W)). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. HUVEC, grown in 6-well plates that contained 2 ml of medium, were transfected with plasmids using FuGENE 6, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science), as previously described (31Islam A. Shen X. Hiroi T. Moss J. Vaughan M. Levine S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9591-9599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μl of Fugene 6 were mixed with 1 μg of plasmid DNA in 100 μl of serum-free medium and added to cells for 14 h. Culture medium was changed, and experiments were performed 2 days later.Immunoblotting—HUVEC were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 120 mm NaCl (Sigma), supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). For immunoblots of HUVEC conditioned medium, cells were grown in medium that contained FBS depleted of exosomes by centrifugation at 175,000 × g at 4 °C for 16 h. Conditioned medium was cleared of cells and debris by sequential centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min, 500 × g for 10 min, 1,200 × g for 20 min, and 10,000 × g for 30 min before immunoblotting of cellular proteins (50 μg/lane) or medium (26 μl/lane). Quantification was performed using NIH Image software (version 1.63) for densitometry (27Islam A. Adamik B. Hawari F.I. Ma G. Rouhani F.N. Zhang J. Levine S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6860-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy—HUVEC grown on collagen I-coated slides (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS (5 min), washed three times with PBS, and blocked with PBS containing 10% donkey and 10% goat serum for 1 h. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: murine monoclonal anti-TNFR1 (H5) antibody (2 μg/ml), rabbit polyclonal anti-BIG2 antibody (1:500), or goat polyclonal anti-RIIβ (E20) antibody (1:200), diluted in PBS containing 1% donkey and 1% goat serum. After washing three times in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, slides were incubated with species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 or Alexa Fluor® 568, (Invitrogen) at a 1:200 dilution. Slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium that contained 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and imaged using a Leica SP laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany).Immunoprecipitation—HUVEC were lysed in buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 120 mm NaCl (Sigma) supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Proteins from HUVEC lysates (400 μg) were incubated for 2 h with 5 μg of mouse anti-penta-His antibodies immobilized on 200 μl of protein A/G beads (Pierce) that had been blocked with 1% ovalbumin in PBS. Beads were washed six times with cold lysis buffer, and immunoblots were performed as previously described (27Islam A. Adamik B. Hawari F.I. Ma G. Rouhani F.N. Zhang J. Levine S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6860-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Proteins from HUVEC supernatants after immunoprecipitation were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) for immunoblotting.Quantification of Extracellular TNFR1 by ELISA—HUVEC were transfected with siRNA for 3 days and then incubated for 24 h in fresh, exosome-depleted medium. Medium cleared of cells and debris as described for immunoblotting was analyzed for TNFR1 using a Quantikine sandwich ELISA kit with a sensitivity of 7.8 pg/ml (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).Statistical Analyses—Data were analyzed by a paired Student's t test with a Boneferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered significant.RESULTScAMP-induced Release of TNFR1 Exosome-like Vesicles from HUVEC—The role of cAMP and cGMP signaling pathways in the release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles from HUVEC was assessed using the cyclic nucleotide analogues, 8-Br-cAMP and 8-Br-cGMP, and forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase. As quantified by ELISA, TNFR1 released into the medium from cells treated with 8-Br-cAMP or forskolin was increased by 68.4 and 59.2%, respectively, as compared with cells treated with vehicle, whereas 8-Br-cGMP treatment had no effect (Fig. 1A). Western blots of medium confirmed that 8-Br-cAMP and forskolin increased the release of the 55-kDa TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles by 99 and 104%, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). A ∼40-kDa TNFR1 band, as previously described, was similarly increased (27Islam A. Adamik B. Hawari F.I. Ma G. Rouhani F.N. Zhang J. Levine S.J. J. Biol.

As quantified by ELISA (Fig. 2A), the amount of TNFR1 released constitutively or in response to 8-Br-cAMP stimulation was significantly reduced when cells were treated with H-89, a relatively specific inhibitor of PKA. Since H-89 can also inhibit MSK1 (mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1), additional experiments were performed using the cell-permeable Myr-PKI, which contains a PKA substrate consensus sequence with the serine replaced by alanine (36Guan H. Hou S. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9957-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Other cells were treated with cell-permeable ERKI to block the ERK signaling pathway that activates MSK1 (36Guan H. Hou S. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol.

Signal. 2005; 17: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the quantity of TNFR1 released, as measured by ELISA, was decreased by Myr-PKI but not ERKI treatment, which is consistent with the involvement of a cAMP-induced PKA-dependent signaling pathway. Western blots of medium confirmed that H-89 and Myr-PKI, but not ERKI, decreased both the constitutive and cAMP-induced release of full-length 55-kDa TNFR1 in exosome-like vesicles (Fig. 2, B and C).FIGURE 2Constitutive and cAMP-mediated TNFR1 exosome-like vesicle release are PKA-dependent.

RNA interference was utilized to decrease specifically levels of mRNA (data not shown) and protein for each of the PKA regulatory subunits RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ, without altering the quantities of TNFR1, ARTS-1, NUCB2 or β-tubulin protein in cell lysates (Fig. 3A). Western blots showed that medium from cells transfected with siRNA targeting RIIβ contained 69% less 55-kDa TNFR1 than did medium from cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA (Fig. 3, A and B). As quantified by ELISA, TNFR1 constitutively released into the medium from cells transfected with siRNA targeting RIIβ was 63% less than that from cells transfected with control nontargeting siRNA (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the siRNA-mediated depletion of RIα, RIβ, or RIIα did not attenuate the release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles. The specificity of the RIIβ siRNA experiments, which utilized a pool of four siRNA duplexes, was confirmed by additional experiments demonstrating that two individual siRNA duplexes targeting RIIβ decreased both RIIβ protein levels and TNFR1 release as quantified by ELISA (data not shown).FIGURE 3The constitutive release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles is regulated by PKA RIIβ.

https://openalex.org/W2040870808,"In neurons and neuroendocrine cells, docked vesicles need to undergo priming to become fusion competent. Priming is a multi-step process that was shown to be associated with vesicle immobilization. However, it is not known whether vesicle immobilization is sufficient to acquire complete fusion competence. To extend our understanding of the physical manifestation of vesicle priming, we took advantage of tomosyn, a SNARE-related protein that specifically inhibits vesicle priming, and measured its effect on vesicle dynamics in live chromaffin cells using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We show here that while in control cells vesicles undergo immobilization before fusion, vesicle immobilization is attenuated in tomosyn overexpressing cells. This in turn increases the turnover rate of vesicles near the membrane and attenuates the fusion of newcomer vesicles. Moreover, the release probability of immobile vesicles in tomosyn cells is significantly reduced, suggesting that immobilization is an early and necessary step in priming but is insufficient, as further molecular processes are needed to acquire complete fusion competence. Using tomosyn as a molecular tool we provide a mechanistic link between functional docking and priming and suggest that functional docking is the first step in vesicle priming, followed by molecular modifications that do not translate into changes in vesicle mobility."
https://openalex.org/W1998028471,"In tropical regions millions of people still live at risk of malaria infection. Indeed the emergence of resistance to chloroquine and other drugs in use in these areas reinforces the need to implement alternative prophylactic strategies. Genistein is a naturally occurring compound that is widely used as a food supplment and is thought to be effective in countering several pathologies. Results presented here show that genistein inhibits liver infection by the Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria. In vitro, genistein decreased the infection rates of both mouse and human hepatoma cells by inhibiting the early stages of the parasite's intracellular development. Oral or intraperitoneal administration of genistein decreased the liver parasite load of P. berghei-infected mice. Moreover, mice fed on a genistein-supplemented diet showed a significant reduction in Plasmodium liver infection as well as a reduced blood parasitemia and partial protection from severe disease. Since genistein is a safe, low-cost, natural compound that can be used permanently in a diet, we propose its use as a prophylactic agent against malaria for endemic populations and long-time travelers."

The F0F1-ATP synthase, located in energy-transducing membranes, utilizes the electrochemical gradient of H+ or Na+ to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi. Under anaerobic conditions, the bacterial enzyme can function as an ATPase, coupled to pump protons across the membrane to generate a ΔμH+. Proton transport is mediated by the membrane-embedded F0 sector (ab2c10) and is separated by a distance greater than 120 Å from the three catalytic sites where ATP hydrolysis/synthesis occurs on the membrane extrinsic F1 segment (α3β3γδϵ) (for reviews see Refs. 1Boyer P.D.

Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Rotational catalysis requires the concerted, sequential participation of all three catalytic sites as they pass through the three different conformations (18Baylis Scanlon J.A. Al-Shawi M.K. Le N.P.

For these reasons, we have argued (23Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12961-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that reversible hydrolysis/synthesis of ATP occurs in the βTP site, and product Pi and ADP are released after the site converts from βDP to βE (18Baylis Scanlon J.A. Al-Shawi M.K. Le N.P. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8785-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Further evidence using fluorescence resonance energy transfer confirmed that the βTP site is the high affinity site (24Mao H.Z. Weber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 18478-18483Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Single molecule experiments have observed that each major 120° step in γ subunit rotation occurs in two substeps as follows: the 80° substep that is dependent on Mg·ATP concentration, followed by a 40° substep that is not affected by Mg·ATP concentration (25Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Attempts to elucidate the role of rotation in the enzymatic mechanism using the single molecule approach include analysis of γ subunit substeps (20Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Itoh H.

However, the structural and mechanistic coordination of γ subunit rotation and the kinetics of the elemental chemical hydrolysis reaction steps cannot be delineated by these studies, and the chemomechanical coupling of the enzyme remains not fully understood.Using pre-steady state analysis, we recently determined the partial reactions of the multisite ATPase hydrolytic pathway and that the rate-limiting step occurs after the reversible hydrolysis/synthesis step and just prior to release of Pi (18Baylis Scanlon J.A. Al-Shawi M.K. Le N.P. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8785-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Scheme 1 adequately describes the multisite kinetic pathway (18Baylis Scanlon J.A.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8785-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar):SCHEME 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We conjectured that the rate-limiting step involves the 40° rotation, and therefore we called it kγ. The pre-steady state kinetics of this step were critical in allowing us to determine its order in the reaction scheme, which provided tremendous insight into the rotational catalytic mechanism. Even though we could directly determine several of the partial reaction rate constants, assignment of kγ to the rotation step in the presteady state was not confirmed.In this study we test our model that the rate-limiting step kγ involves rotation of the γ subunit. To assay the rotation steps, we decided to use a rotor-stator, γ subunit to β subunit, disulfide bond, with the premise that a cross-link would block rotation and therefore stop the partial reactions involving rotation. Such disulfides have been previously observed between the native Cys at position 87 in the Escherichia coli γ subunit and Cys substitutions in the conserved 380βDELSEED386 motif, either at βAsp-380 (27Duncan T.M. Zhou Y. Bulygin V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or βGlu-381 (28Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). For example, Garcia and Capaldi (29García J.J. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15940-15945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that the γ-β-cross-linked F1 had nearly normal unisite kinetic behavior demonstrating that unisite catalysis is independent of the γ subunit rotation. We reasoned that cross-linking the rotor to the stator would lock the position, or at least greatly restrict the rotation of the γ subunit, and therefore prevent the kinetic steps that require rotation. We report here that our data do indeed show this to be the case. Preventing the rotation results in a slower pre-steady state burst of ATP hydrolysis and blocks the release of Pi. These data are consistent with the functional assignments of the catalytic sites where βTP is the high affinity site carrying out reversible hydrolysis/synthesis, and βDP is the site from which product Pi and ADP are released after it converts to βE (18Baylis Scanlon J.A. Al-Shawi M.K. Le N.P. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8785-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We also found that mild perturbations of the βDELSEED function by βE381C causes uncoupling of catalysis and rotation by affecting the establishment of the optimal catalytic conformation resulting in a bypass in the reaction pathway. In the alternative pathway, γ subunit rotation becomes disengaged from hydrolysis thus perturbing its ability to pump protons.Evidence presented in this study suggests the 40° rotation is associated with kγ, and the enzyme needs to acquire the conformation after the 80° rotation substep to achieve positive cooperativity for the promotion of catalysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESF0F1 Strains and Plasmids—The single cysteine mutations (βD380C and βE381C) were introduced into plasmid pUβSE derived from a modified pUC18 vector containing a portion of uncD (γ-subunit gene) between SacI and Eco47III restriction sites (30Ketchum C.J.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8785-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to minimize the background due to the high concentration of [γ-32P]ATP in the experiments. The amount of 32Pi generated was determined by Cerenkov counting in 0.2 m Tris base.Unisite Binding and Hydrolysis of ATP—F1 was prepared as described above for the pre-steady state multisite experiments except that the final centrifuge column was equilibrated with unisite buffer (50 mm Tris base, 50 mm MOPS, 4.5 mm K2SO4 and 0.5 mm MgSO4 adjusted to pH 7.5 with H2SO4). Reactions were performed at 23 °C and were initiated by adding 15 μl of [γ-32P]ATP to F1 while rapidly mixing. The final molar mix ratio of ATP to F1 was ∼0.1. The reactions were quenched at varying times with 550 μl of 50 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8.0, 1 mm KH2PO4, 4.5 mm ATP, 2.8 mm MgSO4, 8.2% v/v HClO4. The total 32Pi generated was determined by the acid molybdate precipitation method of Sugino and Miyoshi (42Sugino Y. Miyoshi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2360-2364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Cerenkov counting in 15 ml of 0.2 m Tris base. The rate of [γ-32P]ATP binding was measured by the hexokinase trap method modified slightly from that described previously (29García J.J. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15940-15945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43Senior A.E. Lee R.S.-F. Al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the unisite reactions were started as described above, but at times shown 200 μl of hexokinase solution (unisite buffer with 2 mg/ml hexokinase (purified from Baker's yeast at ∼170 units/mg), 4.4 mg/ml glucose, and an extra 2.5 mm MgSO4) were added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 s before quenching with 2 n HCl containing 1 mm Pi. Samples were boiled for 7 min to hydrolyze the unreacted [γ-32P]ATP, and the 32Pi was removed by acid molybdate precipitation. The amount of glucose 6-[32P]phosphate formed was determined by measuring the radioactivity of the supernatant by Cerenkov counting in Tris base.Pre-steady State Pi Release—Pi release was followed by the fluorescence intensity change of (7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl) coumarin)-labeled phosphate-binding protein (MDCC-PBP (44White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 45Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R.

Phosphate-binding protein was expressed from E. coli strain ANCC75 (leu purE trp his argG strA phoS64 met thi) harboring plasmid pSN5182/7 (kindly provided by Dr. Martin Webb, MRC, Mill Hill, London, UK) and prepared as described previously (45Brune M.

Unreacted label was separated from MDCC-PBP by passage over a PD-10 desalting column (all chromatography materials were from Amersham Biosciences). Unlabeled phosphate-binding protein and Pi-insensitive MDCC-PBP were removed by passage over a Q-Sepharose column and a Mono-Q column, respectively (45Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The final preparation had a 12-15-fold increase in fluorescence at 465 nm on binding Pi, indicating that the protein was largely Pi-free.Removal of contaminating inorganic phosphate from buffers, the final enzyme preparation, and the stopped-flow spectrometer required a “Pi mop,” assembled as described by Nixon et al. (46Nixon A.E. Hunter J.L. Bonifacio G. Eccleston J.F. Webb M.R. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Pi mop sequesters Pi into the stable ribose 5-phosphate molecule through a coupled enzyme system. Bacterial purine nucleoside phosphorylase and 7-methylguanosine converts phosphate and ribose to ribose 1-phosphate, which is then modified by phosphodeoxyribomutase (PDRM) in the presence of MnCl2 and α-d-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate to form the stable ribose 5-phosphate.Purine nucleoside phosphorylase, 7-methylguanosine, and α-d-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate were purchased from Sigma. Purified PDRM was made by amplifying the E. coli PDRM gene from strain XL1 blue genomic DNA by PCR using primers 5′-ACTCCATGGAACGTGCATTTATTATGGTTCTGGACTCATTCGG-3′ and 5′-ATGCTCGAGTCAGAACATTTGCTTTGCCATATTCCATATCAG-3′. The primers included an NcoI site over the ATG start codon and an XhoI site down-stream of the native stop codon (the restriction sites are depicted by the underscored sequences). The open reading frame was verified by sequencing the entire insert, which was then ligated into the pHIS-Parallel1 vector (47Sheffield P.J. Garrard S.M. Derewenda Z.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and used for expression in BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen). The PDRM protein was purified from cell lysates via an amino-terminal His6 affinity tag.The kinetics of Pi release were followed in an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV-R stopped-flow spectrometer (Surrey, UK). The fluorescence change of MDCC-PBP was monitored at the excitation wavelength of 425 nm with a 455-nm emission cutoff filter. The syringe contents, listed in the figure legends, were essentially the same as for the rapid quench flow experiments except for the lack of radioactivity and the addition of 20 μm MDCC-PBP. The Pi binding response of MDCC-PBP fluorescence was calibrated using known Pi concentrations in the stopped flow at fixed photomultiplier voltage.Kinetic Analysis—The experimental data fitting program, Scientist version 2.0 (Micromath Research, Inc., St. Louis), was used to fit the experimental data by numerical integration of differential equations described in detail previously (18Baylis Scanlon J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2056501679,"N-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) play determining roles in calcium entry at sympathetic nerve terminals and trigger the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. The accessory beta3 subunit of these channels preferentially forms N-type channels with a pore-forming CaV2.2 subunit. To examine its role in sympathetic nerve regulation, we established a beta3-overexpressing transgenic (beta3-Tg) mouse line. In these mice, we analyzed cardiovascular functions such as electrocardiography, blood pressure, echocardiography, and isovolumic contraction of the left ventricle with a Langendorff apparatus. Furthermore, we compared the cardiac function with that of beta3-null and CaV2.2 (alpha1B)-null mice. The beta3-Tg mice showed increased expression of the beta3 subunit, resulting in increased amounts of CaV2.2 in supracervical ganglion (SCG) neurons. The beta3-Tg mice had increased heart rate and enhanced sensitivity to N-type channel-specific blockers in electrocardiography, blood pressure, and echocardiography. In contrast, cardiac atria of the beta3-Tg mice revealed normal contractility to isoproterenol. Furthermore, their cardiac myocytes showed normal calcium channel currents, indicating unchanged calcium influx through VDCCs. Langendorff heart perfusion analysis revealed enhanced sensitivity to electric field stimulation in the beta3-Tg mice, whereas beta3-null and Cav2.2-null showed decreased responsiveness. The plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in the beta3-Tg mice were significantly increased in the basal state, indicating enhanced sympathetic tone. Electrophysiological analysis in SCG neurons of beta3-Tg mice revealed increased calcium channel currents, especially N- and L-type currents. These results identify a determining role for the beta3 subunit in the N-type channel population in SCG and a major role in sympathetic nerve regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2075005979,"Visual stimuli of short duration seem to persist longer after the stimulus offset than stimuli of longer duration. This visual persistence must have a physiological explanation. In ferrets exposed to stimuli of different durations we measured the relative changes in the membrane potentials with a voltage sensitive dye and the action potentials of populations of neurons in the upper layers of areas 17 and 18. For durations less than 100 ms, the timing and amplitude of the firing and membrane potentials showed several non-linear effects. The ON response became truncated, the OFF response progressively reduced, and the timing of the OFF responses progressively delayed the shorter the stimulus duration. The offset of the stimulus elicited a sudden and strong negativity in the time derivative of the dye signal. All these non-linearities could be explained by the stimulus offset inducing a sudden inhibition in layers II–III as indicated by the strongly negative time derivative of the dye signal. Despite the non-linear behavior of the layer II–III neurons the sum of the action potentials, integrated from the peak of the ON response to the peak of the OFF response, was almost linearly related to the stimulus duration."
https://openalex.org/W2024704318,"Increasing genomic instability is associated with aging in eukaryotes, but the connection between genomic instability and natural variation in life span is unknown. We have quantified chronological life span and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) in 11 natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that genomic instability increases and mitotic asymmetry breaks down during chronological aging. The age-dependent increase of genomic instability generally lags behind the drop of viability and this delay accounts for ∼50% of the observed natural variation of replicative life span in these yeast isolates. We conclude that the abilities of yeast strains to tolerate genomic instability co-vary with their replicative life spans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative evidence that demonstrates a link between genomic instability and natural variation in life span."
https://openalex.org/W2037947363,"The present report was addressed to study the influence of sphingolipid metabolism in determining cellular fate. In nonstimulated proliferating Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, sphingolipid de novo synthesis is branched mainly to a production of sphingomyelin and ceramide, with a minor production of sphingosylphosphocholine, ceramide 1-phosphate, and sphingosine 1-phosphate. Experiments with 32P as a radioactive precursor showed that sphingosine 1-phosphate is produced mainly by a de novo independent pathway. Enzymatic inhibition of the de novo pathway and ceramide synthesis affected cell number and viability only slightly, without changing sphingosine 1-phosphate production. By contrast, inhibition of sphingosine kinase-1 activity provoked a significant reduction in both cell number and viability in a dose-dependent manner. When sphingolipid metabolism was studied, an increase in de novo formed ceramide was found, which correlated with the concentration of enzyme inhibitor and the reduction in cell number and viability. Knockdown of sphingosine kinase-1 expression also induced an accumulation of de novo synthesized ceramide, provoking a slight reduction in cell number and viability similar to that induced by a low concentration of the sphingosine kinase inhibitor. Taken together, our results indicate that the level of de novo formed ceramide is controlled by the synthesis of sphingosine 1-phosphate, which appears to occur through a de novo synthesis-independent pathway, most probably the salvage pathway, that is responsible for the MDCK cell fate, suggesting that under proliferating conditions, a dynamic interplay exists between the de novo synthesis and the salvage pathway.

Sphingolipids are considered predominant building blocks of biological membranes. However, it is now accepted that they regulate several aspects of cell behavior (1Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The de novo synthesis of sphingolipids begins with the condensation of serine and a fatty acyl-CoA by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) 2The abbreviations used are: SPTserine palmitoyltransferaseDHSdihydrosphingosinetDHSdl-threo-dihydrosphingosineCerceramideCer-1-Pceramide 1-phosphateDHCerdihydroceramideSMsphingomyelinSphsphingosineSKsphingosine kinaseSph-1-Psphingosine 1-phosphateMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyDMEM/F12Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with nutrient mixture F-12FBSfetal bovine serumSPCsphingosylphosphocholinel-CSl-cycloserineFB1fumonisin B1siRNAsmall interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: SPTserine palmitoyltransferaseDHSdihydrosphingosinetDHSdl-threo-dihydrosphingosineCerceramideCer-1-Pceramide 1-phosphateDHCerdihydroceramideSMsphingomyelinSphsphingosineSKsphingosine kinaseSph-1-Psphingosine 1-phosphateMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyDMEM/F12Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with nutrient mixture F-12FBSfetal bovine serumSPCsphingosylphosphocholinel-CSl-cycloserineFB1fumonisin B1siRNAsmall interfering RNA.

Cer is also produced by the salvage pathway, initiated by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) by the action of SMs. Ceramide is the central core lipid in the metabolism of sphingolipids; it can either be phosphorylated by ceramide kinases to ceramide 1-phosphate (Cer-1-P) or be utilized for the synthesis of SM or glycosphingolipids. Cer can also be broken down by ceramidases to sphingosine (Sph), which is in turn phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases (SKs) to form sphingosine 1-phosphate (Sph-1-P). Sph-1-P can be degraded by specific phosphatases to generate Sph or by a lyase that cleaves it irreversibly into ethanolamine 1-phosphate and palmitaldehyde, thus being the only pathway for sphingolipid degradation (3Futerman A.H.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In opposition to Cer and Sph, Sph-1-P promotes proliferation, survival, and inhibition of apoptosis (12Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys.

It is well documented that different types of cells respond to stress, cytokines, and growth factors by activating SMs and/or by increasing de novo synthesis (15Hannun Y.A. Luberto C.

Both metabolic pathways increase the intracellular level of Cer, which in turn, depending on the expression and activity of Cer-metabolizing enzymes, can lead the metabolic pathway to the formation of pro-proliferating/survival or cell-arresting/death metabolites. In contrast to the well documented importance of sphingolipid metabolism in determining cellular fate under stress conditions or under the effect of external stimuli, very little is known about its role in basal nonstimulated conditions. In a previous work, we showed differential branching of the sphingolipid metabolic pathways according to the developmental stage in rat renal papillae (18Facchinetti M.M. Beuret C. Marquez M.G. Sterin-Speziale N. Biol. Neonat. 2003; 84: 243-251Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We have shown that the developmental regulation of SK expression and activity leads sphingolipid metabolism to the formation of Sph-1-P in the neonatal period and of Cer in adult tissue. Considering the well known biological properties of both metabolites, the results were consistent with the immature-proliferative and fully differentiated-quiescent stages of neonatal and adult tissues, respectively. Because we used ex vivo tissue from neonatal and adult rats, we were unable to demonstrate whether such different branching of the sphingolipid metabolism was either a cause or a consequence of the developmental stage. The present study was undertaken to elucidate whether intracellular sphingolipid metabolism can determine the cellular fate in nonstimulated conditions. Our most important findings were that in nonstimulated proliferating MDCK cells: 1) the level of de novo synthesized Cer is a determining factor to decide cellular fate; and 2) the de novo synthesis of Cer is under the control of the Sph-1-P, which appears to be formed through a de novo synthesis-independent pathway. Materials—MDCK cells were from American Type Culture Collection. Carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (specific activity 25 mCi/mmol) and [3H]serine (specific activity 34 Ci/mmol) were purchased from GE Healthcare, and [14C]palmitic acid (specific activity 55 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. X-ray film for autoradiography was from Eastman Kodak Co. TLC silica gel plates were from Merck. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12; Invitrogen), fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes), Lipofectamine 2000, and Stealth-siRNA were purchased from Invitrogen. Fumonisin B1, l-cycloserine and d,l-threo-dihydrosphingosine, diacylgliceride kinase, alkaline phosphatase type VII, and recombinant sphingosine kinase-1 were from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-human-sphingosine kinase-1 was from Oncogene. Monoclonal anti-Actin was from Chemicon. All other reagents and chemicals were of analytical grade and were from local commercial suppliers (Sigma, Merck, or Mallinckrodt). Cell Culture—2 × 105 MDCK cells were plated in a 33-mm multiwell dish in 2 ml of DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated for 24 h in a 5%CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Then, the medium was changed for 2 ml of DMEM/F12 plus 0.5% FBS and antibiotics. After incubation overnight, the medium was changed again, and various inhibitors were added. Then cells were collected by trypsinization and counted, and cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion procedure. Sphingolipid Metabolism Study—Sphingolipid metabolism was evaluated using three different radioactive precursors. To study the de novo pathway, either 35 nCi/ml [14C]palmitic acid or 2 μCi/ml [H3]serine was added to each well 5 h with the inhibitors. In order to study phosphorylated sphingolipids, 1 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate was added 3 h before finishing inhibitors treatment. Sphingolipid Analysis—After trypsinization, lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer, and mild alkaline hydrolysis was performed for sphingolipid extraction (19Signorelli P. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 275-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids were resolved by TLC using 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1, v/v/v) as a solvent system and were visualized by autoradiography. The corresponding radioactive spots were scraped and counted in a scintillation counter. Sphingolipid species were identified by comparing with the respective retention factors of the standards. Data were normalized to the number of counts incorporated per cell. The levels of endogenous Cer were measured by using the diacylglycerol kinase method as described by Perry et al. (20Perry D.H. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid substrate from 2.106 cells was solubilized by using mixed micelles containing nonionic detergent and phospholipids. The micelle-solubilized lipid extracts were subjected to a diacylglycerol kinase reaction wherein Cer was converted to a quantifiable product by the transfer of [32P]phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP to Cer. The enzymatic product was separated by TLC, identified by comigration with standard Cer-1-P, and quantitated by using the slope of the curved obtained from standard Cer. Data were normalized to the amount of Cer/106 cells. The levels of endogenous Sph-1-P were measured by the enzymatic method described by Edsall et al. (21Edsall L. Vann L. Milstein S. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After trypsinization and washing, the cells were harvested in 1 ml of methanol containing 2.5 μl of HCl. Lipids were extracted by the addition of chloroform/1 m NaCl (1:1) plus 100 μl of 3 n NaOH. The basic aqueous phase was subjected to the action of alkaline phosphatase as described elsewhere (21Edsall L. Vann L. Milstein S. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After acidifying, lipids were extracted twice with chloroform and evaporated under an N2 stream. The lipid extract was used as substrate for recombinant SK, and the assay was performed as described below. Data were normalized to the amount of Sph-1-P/106 cells. Hoechst 33258 Staining—MDCK cells were plated on glass coverslips in a 33-mm multiwell dish and cultured as described above. After 6 h of treatment with the inhibitors, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.12 m sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. After fixation, buffer was washed, and cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 (5 μm final concentration) for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. The stained nuclei were examined by epifluorescence using an Olympus BX50 microscope, and photographs were taken with a CoolSnap digital camera with acquisition software Image Pro Plus (version 5.5). Transfection with Small Interference RNA—MDCK cells were plated in a 12- multiwell dish (5 × 104 cells/well) in 1 ml of DMEM/F12 plus 10% FBS without antibiotics. After 24 h, cells were transfected for 24 h with 200 nm double-stranded siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfection reagents were washed out, and cells were incubated for another 48 h in DMEM/F12 with 0.5% FBS. The sequences of siRNAs for human SK1 were GGGCAAGGCUCUGCAGCUCTdTd and GAGCUGCAGAGCCUUGCCCTdTd, and the sequences of scrambled siRNA were CAGUCGCGUUUGCGACUGG and CCAGUCGCAAACGCGACUG (22Taha T.A.

(23Merrill A.H. Nixon D.W. Williams R.D. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 617-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell homogenate, 150 μm palmitoyl-CoA, and 1 mm l-[3H]serine (specific radioactivity 13,333 cpm) were incubated in 100 mm Hepes, pH 8.3, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 50 μm dithiothreitol. The reaction proceeded for 35 min and was terminated with the addition of 0.2 ml of 0.5 m NH4OH on ice. After the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), 2 ml of 0.5 m NH4OH and 50 μg of DHS were added. Then, the sample was centrifuged, the aqueous phase was removed, and the organic phase was washed twice with 2 ml of water. The extracted organic phase was dried under an N2 stream, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Data were normalized to the amount of product per mg of protein. Proteins were determined by the method of Lowry (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative activity of DH-Cer/Cer synthases was determined as described by Wang et al. (25Wang E. Norred N.P. Bacon L.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured cells were incubated in the presence of 1 μCi of [14C]DHS. After 6 h of incubation, the cells were scraped from the well, 25 μg of unlabeled ceramide carrier was added, and the lipids were extracted as described above. The [14C]Cer was separated from the substrate by TLC developed with diethyl ether: methanol: (99:1, v/v) and visualized by autoradiography, and the amount of radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Data were normalized to the amount of Cer formed per mg of protein. Sphingosine kinase activity was measured as described by Olivera et al. (26Olivera A. Barlow K.D. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 215-223Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm deoxypyridoxine, 15 mm NaF, β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20% glycerol. Cells were lysed by repeated freezing and thawing. An aliquot of lysates was incubated with 50 μm Sph (in 4 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi dissolved in 200 mm MgCl2). The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped on ice by adding 20 μl of 1 n HCl and 800 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100: 200:1, v/v/v). After 10 min at room temperature, 240 μl of chloroform and 240 μl of 2 m KCl were added, and samples were centrifuged. The organic layer was extracted and dried under an N2 stream. Lipids were resolved by TLC using 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1, v/v/v) as the solvent system. Labeled Sph-1-P was visualized by autoradiography, and the corresponding radioactive spot was scraped and counted in a scintillation counter. Data were normalized to the amount of Sph-1-P formed per mg of protein. Immunoblot Analysis—After treatment with trypsin-EDTA, cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. They were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50%-diluted phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h on ice. The lysate was homogenized with a 21-gauge needle and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min. Protein concentration was determined in the supernatant using the Lowry assay. An equal amount of protein was resuspended in 4× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride, the membranes were blocked for 1 h in 10% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) and probed with a primary antibody against human SK1 (goat polyclonal, Oncogene) overnight, washed three times with TBST, and probed with secondary antibodies. The membranes were then rinsed, and the signal was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Charge was controlled by parallel detection of β-actin in the same polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblot signals were quantified by optical density on a Gel-Pro Analyzer 3.1. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Data from controls and different treatments were analyzed by analysis of variance, and significant differences were assessed by an a posteriori Scheffé test (p < 0.05). Sphingolipid Metabolism in Nonstimulated Proliferating MDCK Cells—After a “lag” period (∼24 h, Fig. 1A), MDCK cells still proliferated at the rate of approximately one cycle of division every 24 h, although they were submitted to a low concentration of FBS. Because experiments were performed at 48 h (Fig. 1A, arrow), the results obtained corresponded to nonstimulated proliferating cells, which presented ∼100% of viability. Sphingolipid metabolism was evaluated by using three radioactive precursors. As seen in Fig. 1B, when [14C]palmitic acid was used as a metabolic precursor, most of the radioactivity was found associated with SM (50% of total radioactivity), and 24% remained associated with Cer. Intermediate metabolites were not accumulated, and the end products, sphingosylphosphocholine (SPC), DHS-1-P, and Cer-1-P, accounted for only 8, 6, and 9%, of total radioactivity, respectively. The profile of [3H]serine incorporation showed that most of the radioactivity was found associated with Cer and SM, accounting for 37 and 24% of total radioactivity, respectively. SPC, Cer-1-P, and DHS-1-P appeared as minor end products with each one representing 10% of the total radioactivity. The profile of 32P incorporation showed that Sph-1-P was the prominent phosphorylated sphingolipid metabolite formed, accounting for 45% of total radioactivity, followed by SPC (25%), SM (17%), and Cer-1-P (12.5%). In the representative TLC plate colored by iodine vapors, it can be observed that SM is the major sphingolipid followed by SPC and Cer. The other sphingolipid were minor species and were almost undetectable. In the TLC plate colored by ninhydrin (a sensitive reagent to detect the free amine group), a single spot corresponding to the retention factor of Sph-1-P was observed. Collectively, the results show that in nonstimulated proliferating MDCK cells, sphingolipid de novo synthesis leads to SM production efficiently, preserving a considerable level of de novo synthesized Cer. The level of [14C]SM was higher than that of [14C]Cer, but, when [3H]serine was used as a metabolic precursor, the amount of radioactivity associated with Cer was higher than that of SM. This result is consistent with previous observations demonstrating that Cer containing C16 fatty acid is the species that is most involved in SM synthesis (22Taha T.A. Kitatani K. El Alwani M. Bielawski J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. FASEB J. 2005; 20: 482-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) Effect of Serine Palmitoyltransferase Inhibition on Nonstimulated Proliferating MDCK Cells—The first step in sphingolipid de novo synthesis, which is catalyzed by the SPT, is rate-limiting for the entire pathway and, consequently, a major point of regulation. The treatment of subconfluent proliferating MDCK cells for 24 h with 0.5 mm l-cycloserine (l-CS), an inhibitor of SPT activity, induced a moderate decrease in cell number (79% of the cells present in the control cultures) without affecting cell viability (93%) (Fig. 2, A and B). As a result of SPT inhibition, the overall incorporation of [14C]palmitic acid to sphingolipids fell by about 68% (Fig. 2C). The 14C radioactivity associated with the various sphingolipids decreased without significant changes on the profile of distribution. Thus, the most important formed metabolites, SM and Cer, decreased by 74 and 79%, respectively, and the minor end products, Cer-1-P and SPC, decreased by 76 and 51%, respectively. No changes were observed in DHS and DHS-1-P (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2D, the incorporation of 32P into the various sphingolipids was selectively affected by l-cycloserine. The treatment induced a 43 and 44% decrease in the radioactivity associated with SM and SPC, respectively, whereas no changes were observed in Sph-1-P and Cer-1-P. The fact that 32P incorporation into Sph-1-P was refractory to the inhibition of SPT indicates that inhibition of de novo synthesis does not appear to inhibit [32P]orthophosphate incorporation into Sph-1-P. On the other hand, [32P]Cer-1-P was also resistant to SPT inhibition, thus suggesting that Cer-1-P can be synthesized from de novo formed Cer (affected by SPT inhibition) and also from a preexisting pool of Cer (resistant to SPT inhibition). Collectively, the results demonstrated that Sph-1-P appeared to be formed by a de novo synthesis-independent pathway and that the inhibition of the committed step of the biosynthetic pathway for 24 h did not induce cell death and affected cell proliferation only slightly. Effect of Fumonisin B1 on Nonstimulated Proliferating MDCK Cells—We were also interested in determining whether the inhibition of (dihydro)ceramide synthase affects the proliferation and survival of subconfluent MDCK cells and the relationship between this effect and sphingolipid metabolism. As seen in Fig. 3A, after 24 h of treatment with fumonisin B1 (FB1), the number of cells was only 17% smaller than that of controls, and most of the cells (86%) survived as determined by the trypan blue assay (Fig. 3B). The prominent effect of FB1 on the de novo pathway was the accumulation of [14C]DHS (50-fold; Fig. 3C). Concomitantly, Cer de novo synthesis fell to 16% of the control, and [14C]SM decreased to 8% of the control value. The total amount of [14C]palmitate distributed into the various metabolites did not decrease, thus reflecting that the SPT activity was not affected. As shown in Fig. 3D, 32P radioactivity associated with Sph-1-P and Cer-1-P was not significantly affected by FB1. In contrast, the 32P radioactivity associated with SPC and SM decreased to 30 and 34% of the control value, respectively. These results constitute a further demonstration that even though the formation of 14C- and 32P-labeled SM and SPC was coupled to Cer de novo synthesis, the formation of [32P]Sph-1-P and [32P]Cer-1-P appeared to be independent of Cer synthesis. Effect of SK Inhibition on Nonstimulated Proliferating MDCK Cells—As seen in Fig. 4, A and B, treatment for 24 h with an inhibitor of SK (d,l-threo-dihydrosphingosine (tDHS)) caused a clear deleterious effect in nonstimulated proliferating MDCK cells. Thus, the number of cells decreased (∼60%), and viability was lost in 62% of the cells (Fig. 4, A and B). When sphingolipid metabolism was evaluated biochemically, we observed that the total amount of [14C]palmitic acid radioactivity per cell increased by about 43% of the control value, explained mostly by a high accumulation of radioactive Cer, which presented an almost 300% increase (Fig. 4C). When [3H]serine was used as a radioactive precursor, as shown in Fig. 3D,[3H]Cer accumulated, reaching an almost 150% increase. Total 3H radioactivity showed a 71% increase as compared with the control value. A significant accumulation of radioactive DHS was also observed with both radioactive precursors, whereas no significant changes were found in any other metabolite. When 32P incorporation was evaluated, we observed that Sph-1-P was the only phosphorylated metabolite affected, showing a 50% decrease and thus reflecting the specific inhibition of SK. Collectively, the results demonstrated that SK inhibition, besides inducing a decrease in the production of Sph-1-P, evoked an accumulation of de novo synthesized Cer and that such a metabolic condition was highly deleterious for proliferating MDCK cells. Effect of Cer Synthesis Inhibition on tDHS-treated Cells—To determine whether SK inhibition had induced cell death because of the decrease in the production of Sph-1-P or the accumulation of de novo synthesized Cer, cultured cells were treated with inhibitors of Cer synthesis over the inhibition of SK enzymatic activity. FB1 treatment partially reversed the decrease in cell number, whereas SPT inhibition evoked an almost complete recovery (Fig. 5A). With respect to cell viability, the inhibition of the de novo synthesis pathway rescued the cells from death, with l-cycloserine being more efficient than FB1 (Fig. 5B). To visualize the effect of SK inhib"

The pattern was consistent in 3/4 immunized apes against two high dose sporozoite challenges performed as late as 98 and 238 days post-immunization and by a heterologous strain.These results should, in our opinion, lead to a revisiting of the value of this unusual means of immunisation, using as a model a disease, malaria, in which virulent challenges of volunteers are ethically acceptable."
https://openalex.org/W2011605089,Background The Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus replicon system was used to produce virus-like replicon particles (VRP) packaged with a number of different VEE-derived glycoprotein (GP) coats. The GP coat is believed to be responsible for the cellular tropism noted for VRP and it is possible that different VEE GP coats may have different affinities for cells. We examined VRP packaged in four different VEE GP coats for their ability to infect cells in vitro and to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings The VRP preparations were characterized to determine both infectious units (IU) and genome equivalents (GE) prior to in vivo analysis. VRP packaged with different VEE GP coats demonstrated widely varying GE/IU ratios based on Vero cell infectivity. BALB/c mice were immunized with the different VRP based on equal GE titers and the humoral and cellular responses to the expressed HIV gag gene measured. The magnitude of the immune responses measured in mice revealed small but significant differences between different GP coats when immunization was based on GE titers. Conclusions/Significance We suggest that care should be taken when alternative coat proteins are used to package vector-based systems as the titers determined by cell culture infection may not represent accurate particle numbers and in turn may not accurately represent actual in vivo dose.
https://openalex.org/W1985563101,"GA-binding protein (GABP) is the only Ets family transcription factor that functions as a heterodimer. The GABPα subunit binds to DNA, and the GABPβ subunit possesses the ability to transactivate target genes. Inactivation of GABPα caused embryonic lethality and defective lymphocyte development and immune responses. There are 3 isoforms of the GABPβ subunit, but whether they have distinct functions has not been addressed. In this study, we selectively ablated the expression of GABPβ2 using a gene trap strategy. GABPβ2-deficient mice were viable and had normal T and B cell development, suggesting that loss of GABPβ2 is compensated for by other GABPβ isoforms during these processes. GABPβ2-deficient T cells can be activated and proliferate similarly to wild-type controls. In contrast, B cells lacking GABPβ2 showed 2–3-fold increases in proliferation in response to B cell receptor stimulation. In addition, GABPβ2-deficient mice exhibited moderately increased antibody production and germinal center responses when challenged with T-dependent antigens. These results indicate that albeit GABPβ isoforms are redundant in lymphocyte development, GABPβ2 has a distinct role in restraining B cell expansion and humoral responses.

Resendes K.K. Yang Z. McMillan J.N. Fleming S.L. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). GABPα contains a DNA binding Ets domain, which is conserved among all the Ets factors and is of ∼85 amino acids in length. The Ets domain assumes a winged helix-loop-helix configuration and binds preferentially to a purine-rich consensus DNA sequence containing GGA(A/T). On the other hand, GABPβ cannot bind DNA but contains 4 ankyrin repeats in its N terminus, which mediate the protein-protein interaction with GABPα. GABPβ also contains a nuclear localization signal, which targets the GABPα/β dimer into the nucleus. Transactivation activity of the GABPα/β complex is considered to reside in the C terminus of the GABPβ subunit, but the exact location has not been unequivocally mapped.The GABPα/β complex has versatile roles in regulating basic cellular functions and tissue-specific functions (1Rosmarin A.G.

Recently, we showed that GABP is a key component of a gene regulatory network programming B lineage commitment and differentiation by directly regulating Pax5 gene expression (16Xue H.H.

In contrast to extensive studies on GABPα, the roles of the GABPβ subunit in vivo have not been investigated. The most studied GABPβ isoforms are those encoded by the Gabpb1 allele, which generates two protein products, GABPβ1L (originally named GABPβ1 or GABPβ1-1) and GABPβ1S (originally named GABPβ2 or GABPβ1-2), via alternative splicing (17Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18de la Brousse F.C. Birkenmeier E.H. King D.S. Rowe L.B. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 332 amino acids of both GABPβ1L and GABPβ1S isoforms are identical, but their C termini differ in length and sequence. GABPβ1L has a longer C-terminal tail (50 amino acids), which adopts a leucine zipper-like structure, forming homodimers and even an α2β2 GABP tetramer when two Ets motifs are adjacent or brought into proximity (17Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 19Sawada J. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H.

In contrast, the C terminus of the shorter isoform, GABPβ1S, is 15 amino acids long, lacks the leucine zipper-like structure, and thus cannot form homodimers or tetramers. Nevertheless, both GABPβ1L and GABPβ1S heterodimerize with GABPα with similar affinity (21Suzuki F. Goto M. Sawa C. Ito S. Watanabe H. Sawada J. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29302-29308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has been disputed over whether the leucine zipper-like structure in GABPβ1L has a unique role in transactivation of GABP target genes. In a recent report, we specifically targeted GABPβ1L by deleting exon 9 of the Gabpb1 gene that encodes the entire leucine zipper-like structure without eliminating the GABPβ1S isoform (22Xue H.H. Jing X. Bollenbacher-Reilley J. Zhao D.M. Haring J.S. Yang B. Liu C. Bishop G.A. Harty J.T. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 4300-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast to a pre-implantation lethality in a GABPα-null mutant, GABPβ1L–/– mice were viable. On the other hand, targeting both GABPβ1L and GABPβ1S caused embryonic lethality prior to embryonic day 12.5 (22Xue H.H. Jing X. Bollenbacher-Reilley J. Zhao D.M. Haring J.S. Yang B. Liu C. Bishop G.A. Harty J.T. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 4300-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the Gabpb1 gene products are required for normal embryogenesis, whereas loss of GABPβ1L expression can be compensated for by other GABPβ isoforms including GABPβ1S.A third GABPβ isoform, GABPβ2 (originally named GABPβ2-1), is encoded by Gabpb2 (18de la Brousse F.C. Birkenmeier E.H. King D.S. Rowe L.B. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and is 414-amino acids long with its N-terminal ankyrin repeats (amino acids 1–130) sharing 87% identity with GABPβ1 isoforms. GABPβ2 also has a long C terminus, with its 317–366 amino acid residues sharing 70% identity with that of GABPβ1L and also adopting a leucine zipper-like structure. The 367– 414 amino acid residues in GABPβ2 are unique. The C terminus of GABPβ2 cannot only mediate the formation of GABPβ2 homodimers but also mediates the heterodimerization of GABPβ2 and GABPβ1L (18de la Brousse F.C. Birkenmeier E.H. King D.S. Rowe L.B. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since its initial cloning, GABPβ2 has not been studied, and its function is completely unknown. The structural similarity raised the possibility that GABPβ isoforms may have distinct and overlapping roles in regulating lymphocyte development and functional responsiveness. As one of the first steps aiming to dissect the exact roles of each GABPβ isoform, we have inactivated the Gabpb2 gene using a gene trap strategy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES5′-RACE and RT-PCR—Splenic B cells were negatively selected using EasySep B cell enrichment kits (StemCell Technology), and total RNA was extracted from purified B cells or total thymocytes using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and 5′-RACE was done with the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). Racer and nest racer primers were supplied in the kit, and antisense primers complementary to mouse GABPβ2 cDNA (5′-GCAGCTTCTAGCAGCCTCTTC and 5′-TTCCCCAAGTCCACCAGAGAC) were used in RT-PCRs (Fig. 1A). Nested PCR was performed to increase the specificity of amplification. PCR products were subcloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector with a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and then sequenced.Generation of GABPβ2-targeted Mice—An ES clone (RRJ488) was obtained from the International Gene Trap Consortium through the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center of the University of California at Davis. Mapping of the insertion site of the reporter gene is done using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science). The ES cells were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and male chimeras were identified to achieve germline transmission. GABPβ2+/tp mice were interbred to obtain GABPβ2tp/tp and littermate controls. All experiments with mice followed protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, University of Iowa.Generation of GABPβ2 Antisera and Western Blotting—To generate antisera that are specific to GABPβ2 with no cross-reaction with GABPβ1, we used a recombinant GST fusion protein expressing GABPβ2 C-terminal amino acids 275– 414 as an antigen, because the N termini of all GABPβ isoforms contain highly conserved ankyrin repeat domains. To this end, we PCR-amplified cDNA corresponding to the GABPβ2 C-terminal fragment in a pGEX-4T-1 vector and expressed the fusion protein in BL21 Star competent cells (Stratagene). The fusion protein was expressed at high abundance with expected molecular weight and purified with magnetic resin-based Mag-neGST particles (Promega). The expression of GABPβ2 was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and the purified protein was used to immunize rabbits for antibody production (Bio-synthesis). To test the specificity of the GABPβ2 anti-serum, we cloned GABPβ1L and GABPβ2 cDNA in pCruz-HA vector (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) so that an HA tag is fused to the N terminus of each expressed protein. We then expressed these proteins in 293 HEK cell lines, and subjected the cell lysates to immunoblot with anti-HA antibody, which detected both GABPβ1L and GABPβ2 of expected molecular weight (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the GABPβ2 antiserum detected GABPβ2 at a 1:2000 dilution but did not cross-react with GABPβ1 (Fig. 2C). For detection of GABPβ2 expression, whole cell extracts were prepared from thymocytes, splenocytes, and splenic B cells as described previously (23Xue H.H. Fink Jr., D.W. Zhang X. Qin J. Turck C.W. Leonard W.J. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Lysate protein (30 μg) was separated on SDS/PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the GABPβ2 antiserum (14Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B.

An anti-GABPα antibody (H180, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect GABPα expression, and an antiserum raised against the N terminus of GABPβ1 (14Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V.

All fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were from BD PharMingen or eBiosciences. Negatively selected splenic B cells were labeled with CFSE as described (16Xue H.H. Bollenbacher-Reilley J. Wu Z.

T cells (1 × 105/well) were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (0.25 or 0.5 μg/ml, clone 145-2C11, BD Biosciences) in the absence or presence of anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml, clone 37.51, BD Biosciences). B cells (0.6 × 105/well) were stimulated with 2.5 μg/ml anti-IgM μ chain (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), 5 μg/ml anti-CD40 (BD PharMingen), 5 μg/ml LPS (Sigma), or 1 μg/ml CpG oligonucleotides (ODN1862, Invivogen). The cells were cultured in 96-well plates in triplicate for each condition for 48–60 h and pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer) for the last 12 h of culture. Radioactivity incorporated into cells was collected on a UniFilter-96 (GF/B, PerkinElmer) with a cell harvester and was counted using a TopCount.NXT microplate scintillation and a luminescence counter (Packard).Immunization and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—To determine the immune response to a T-independent antigen, mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 100 μg of TNP(52)-AECM-Ficoll (Biosearch Technologies), and the sera were collected on day 8 after immunization. For immune responses to a T-dependent antigen, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 100 μg of Imject Ovalbumin (Pierce) mixed with Imject Alum (Pierce, volume 1:1), boosted 1 week later with the same regimen, and sera collected after another week. The sera were diluted in 1:2 series to a total of 12 points, and TNP- or ovalbumin-specific immunoglobulins (Igs) were measured by ELISA. In brief, high binding plates (Immulux, Dynex) were coated with either 20 μg/ml of TNP(38)-BSA (Bioresearch Technologies) or 5 μg/ml of Imject Ovalbumin to absorb antigen-specific Igs, which were then detected with biotin-conjugated rat anti-mouse antibodies specific for murine IgM, IgG1, and IgG3. Visualization of the antigen-antibody complexes was revealed with the avidin-horseradish peroxidase and TMB substrate set (BD PharMingen), and absorbance at 450 nm was read on an ELX800 microplate reader (Bio-TEK). Linear absorbance readings were observed within one particular range of serum dilutions, and these absorbance readings were used to compare antigen-specific Ig titers in WT and GABPβ2-deficient mice.Sheep Red Blood Cell (SRBC) Immunization and Immunohistochemistry—Mice were i.p. injected with 0.2 ml of 10% v/v SRBC suspension (Colorado Serum Company) in phosphate-buffered saline, and spleens were harvested on days 8, 12, and 18 postimmunization. Splenocyte suspensions from half of the spleen were stained with anti-B220 mAb along with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA, Vector Laboratories), and analyzed for GC B cell responses by flow cytometry. The other half of the spleen was used to determine GC structures by immunohistochemistry as described (24Shinall S.M. Gonzalez-Fernandez M. Noelle R.J. Waldschmidt T.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5729-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).RESULTSStructure of 5′-Untranslated Regions in the Gabpb2 Gene—In our previous studies, we used ES clones that have a Gabpa allele inactivated by a gene trap strategy to generate GABPα-deficient mice (14Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Xue H.H. Bollenbacher-Reilley J. Wu Z. Spolski R. Jing X. Zhang Y.C. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 2007; 26: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this method, ES cells were retrovirally transduced with a reporter gene, such as βgeo, which is a fusion of β-galactosidase and a neomycin resistance gene. When the reporter gene is integrated into the ES genome and inserted in an intron of a gene, the gene is thus trapped. Because a strong splice acceptor is placed immediately 5′ of the reporter gene after the trapped gene is transcribed, the splicing will occur between the upstream introns and the reporter gene, resulting in truncation and/or inactivation of the trapped gene. By searching the data base of the International Gene Trap Consortium, we identified an ES clone (named RRJ488) which has an insertion of the βgeo reporter gene in the Gabpb2 locus. The insertion presumably occurred in an intron that is downstream of a non-coding exon at the 5′-end of the locus. The information on the Gabpb2 gene structure suggests existence of three 5′ non-coding exons and alternative usage of the exons. If this approach is to be used to study the effect of Gabpb2 inactivation in lymphocytes obtained from RRJ488 ES clone-derived mice, it is important to determine whether these exons are utilized in B and T cells. We therefore used rapid amplification of cDNA 5′-end assay (5′-RACE) to determine the transcription initiation sites and the usage of 5′ non-coding exons in the Gabpb2 gene. We performed nested RT-PCRs on splenic B cells (Fig. 1A) and observed three major transcripts (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the sequences of each transcript revealed that transcription of the Gabpb2 gene can be initiated from three different sites. If we arbitrarily define a location 12,480 bp upstream of exon 2 as “+1,” transcription can be initiated from +959, +1042, and +1118 bp, and that the three 5′ non-coding exons are utilized differently in each transcript (Fig. 1C). We also characterized Gabpb2 transcription initiation sites in thymocytes and observed two major transcripts that correspond to Transcripts 1 and 3 in B cells (data not shown). These results indicate that although transcription of the Gabpb2 gene can be initiated from different locations and there is different usage of 5′ non-coding exons, the protein product from these transcripts is not altered.GABPβ2 Expression Is Completely Abolished in GABPβ2tp/tp Mice—We then mapped the insertion site of the βgeo reporter gene in the RRJ488 ES cells using long template PCR. Based on the sequence tags provided for the ES clone, sense primers were designed based on the genomic sequence starting from exon 1a, and an antisense primer was based on the βgeo coding sequence. Sequence analysis of the PCR product revealed that the insertion occurred between exons 1b and 1c (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 1C, because at least one part of the first non-coding exon (exon 1a) is used in all transcripts, we hypothesized that the insertion of the βgeo reporter between exons 1b and 1c will interfere with normal splicing and inactivate the Gabpb2 gene. ES cells were injected into blastocysts to generate GABPβ2+/tp mice. Germline-transmitted GABPβ2+/tp mice gave birth to GABPβ2tp/tp mice at a normal Mendelian ratio and were grossly normal. To determine GABPβ2 protein expression, we raised an antiserum specific for GABPβ2 using its C-terminal portion as an antigen, which can specifically recognize GABPβ2 but does not cross-react with GABPβ1L (Fig. 2, B and C). By Western blotting, we found that GABPβ2 expression is easily detected in both thymocytes and splenocytes in WT mice and is not detectable in GABPβ2tp/tp mice (Fig. 2D). This is in contrast to the situation of GABPαtp/tp embryos, which had hypomorphic expression of GABPα protein (14Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Xue H.H. Bollenbacher-Reilley J. Wu Z. Spolski R. Jing X. Zhang Y.C. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 2007; 26: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The difference is likely ascribed to the location of reporter gene insertion and/or the gene context. We further confirmed that ablation of GABPβ2 did not alter the expression of GABPβ1L, GABPβ1S, and GABPα (Fig. 2E).Loss of GABPβ2 Expression Does Not Perturb T and B Cell Development—Previously we have demonstrated that GABPα is critically required for IL-7Rα expression in T cells as well as for normal B cell development (14Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Xue H.H.

T cells develop in the thymus, with the most immature thymocytes being double negative (DN) for CD4 and CD8 expression. DN thymocytes then develop into CD4 and CD8 double positive (DP) cells, which further mature to CD4+ or CD8+ single positive cells (25Rothenberg E.V. Taghon T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 601-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The thymocyte, splenocytes, splenic T and B cells numbers between GABPβ2tp/tp and WT control were comparable (Fig. 3A). Staining of thymoyctes with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies revealed that the percentages of DN, DP, CD4+, and CD8+ subset were not altered in GABPβ2tp/tp mice (Fig. 3B). DN thymocytes can be further divided into four developmental stages based on CD25 and CD44 expression, i.e. DN1 (CD44+CD25–), DN2 (CD44+CD25+), DN3 (CD44–CD25+), and DN4 (CD44–CD25–). Fractionation of DN thymocytes with CD25 and CD44 staining showed that all four DN subsets appeared at similar frequencies between WT and GABPβ2tp/tp mice (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the loss of GABPβ2 expression does not affect T cell development, including early stages. In the periphery, splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in GABPβ2tp/tp mice appeared at a normal ratio (Fig. 3D), and IL-7Rα expression on GABPβ2tp/tp CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was not diminished (Fig. 3E and data not shown for CD8 cells), indicating that GABPβ2 is dispensable for IL-7Rα expression on peripheral T cells.FIGURE 3Normal T and B cell development in GABPβ2tp/tp mice. A, cellularity of thymus and spleen. Cell numbers of the thymus and spleen in WT and GABPβ2tp/tp (KO) mice were determined. The splenocytes were stained with anti-CD3 and anti-B220 antibodies, and percentages of CD3+ and B220+ were used to calculated splenic T and B cells, respectively. B, thymocyte development. Thymocytes from WT and GABPβ2tp/tp mice were stained with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies and the percentage of each population was shown. C, early thymocyte developmental stages.

Representative data from at least five independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also examined B cell development in GABPβ2tp/tp mice. Fractionation of bone marrow cells reveals three populations of sequentially developing B cells, i.e. pro-B and pre-B (B220+IgM–), immature (B220medIgM+), and recirculating B cells (B220highIgM+) (26Hardy R.R. Hayakawa K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 595-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). All three populations in the bone marrow of GABPβ2tp/tp mice were detected at similar percentages to those observed in WT controls (Fig. 3F). In the periphery, the frequency of total splenic B cells and marginal zone B cells (CD21highCD23dim) was comparable between WT and GABPβ2tp/tp mice (Fig. 3H). The CD23brightB220+ subset is heterogeneous and can be further fractionated to sequentially maturation stages, transitional 1 (CD24highCD21low), transitional 2 (CD24highCD21high), and mature follicular (CD24dimCD21dim)B cells (27Loder F.

https://openalex.org/W2114387581,"Recently, there was a report that explored the oxygen content of transmembrane proteins over macroevolutionary time scales where the authors observed a correlation between the geological time of appearance of compartmentalized cells with atmospheric oxygen concentration. The authors predicted, characterized and correlated the differences in the structure and composition of transmembrane proteins from the three kingdoms of life with atmospheric oxygen concentrations in geological timescale. They hypothesized that transmembrane proteins in ancient taxa were selectively excluding oxygen and as this constraint relaxed over time with increase in the levels of atmospheric oxygen the size and number of communication-related transmembrane proteins increased. In summary, they concluded that compartmentalized and non-compartmentalized cells can be distinguished by how oxygen is partitioned at the proteome level. They derived this conclusion from an analysis of 19 taxa. We extended their analysis on a larger sample of taxa comprising 309 eubacterial, 34 archaeal, and 30 eukaryotic complete proteomes and observed that one can not absolutely separate the two groups of cells based on partition of oxygen in their membrane proteins. In addition, the origin of compartmentalized cells is likely to have been driven by an innovation than happened 2700 million years ago in the membrane composition of cells that led to the evolution of endocytosis and exocytosis rather than due to the rise in concentration of atmospheric oxygen."
